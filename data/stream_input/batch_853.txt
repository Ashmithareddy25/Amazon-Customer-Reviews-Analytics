0743454537|2.0|I was willing to finish this book, but I hurried through the second half because I wanted it to be over, not because I couldn't wait to see how it ended.  The book is a lot longer than it should be because the author is constantly kicking the reader in the face with metaphors.  And the ironical ending was really too much.  The characters are flat in spite of all their introspection, and things work out so patly at the end that it's ridiculous (one character, a felonious arsonist with a drug and alcohol problem who steals construction equipment in his spare time, becomes a police officer!).  The mother is incredibly difficult to like considering her very legitimate grief.  And a romance subplot between attorneys works out in spite of the guy being a huge jerk because his lady-love finds out that he, of all things, suffers from a disability.  Though well-written to some degree, I simply can't recommend this book.
B000VBIGD6|4.0|In his own comic way Chevy Chase captures the joy, challenges and frustrations many father's feel at Christmas.  It is surprising he handles some of the situations as well as he does.  I would NOT have let Randy Quaid in my house!  But his father in the movie sums it up the best when he mentions a lot of Christmases talking to Jack: Jack Daniels.  Me too!
0312383320|3.0|Evanovich must really be pulling in the bucks with all these between-the-numbers books, which seem to come out every other month.  They are analagous to me telling my boss I expect the same pay for reducing my productivity from \\"excellent\\" to \\"adequate.\\"  He wouldn't go for it, and I don't think fans of the Plum series are going to either.  Evanovich needs to be putting more effort into the numbered Plum series anyway, which have dropped in quality over the past several years.      If I had never read a Stephanie Plum book, I would have enjoyed this one, because my expectations would have been low.  The criminal and minor characters are ridiculous and seem to have been pulled from old Looney Tunes cartoons.  The major characters coast on past dialogue, which would be funny enough if it were the first time I was reading it.  The actual criminal conspiracy at the heart of the plot is confusing and would seem to call for the assistance of federal law enforcement, not a slapstick bounty hunter and her mysterious, supposeably supernatural friend, who is incredibly attractive and whom she sleeps with naked but doesn't have sex with (?) because that, of course, would be cheating on her on-again, off-again police officer boyfriend.  This is not so much spooky as convoluted and messy.      Evanovich is a great storyteller, and to a certain extent, her zaniness has contributed to the success of the Plum series.  But this is going too far for too little payoff.  Especially when we know she can do so much better.
B001DTUU7A|4.0|This is a great kid's movie and their parents will enjoy watching it with them.  This movie will engage your child's imagination of the smallest things in the universe in a playful and compassionate way. It is full of nice value statements about compassion, trust, power, jealousy, loyalty, and frivality.  It is a fun, feel-good movie that will be watched again and again.
0446691437|5.0|Resistance is real. It plagues everyone.  We all have dreams we want to pursue but don't.  We fear failure.  We live in Ego.  Writers, artists, and other creatives of any stripe are particularly prone to debilitating procrastination.<br /><br />I think that Pressfield's book is the best I've seen on dealing with this reality.  I've read a myriad of books (albeit I admit it sadly because I should have been creating instead of reading) on writer's block and dealing with fear.<br /><br />The War of Art is simply the best book I've read to refresh the warrior spirit and enable me to fight back.  I go back to it again and again.  His advice resonates strongly within me. When he says \\"the warrior and the artist live by the same code of necessity which dictates that the battle must be fought anew each day\\", it reminds me to take a deep breath, push Ego away, and bring my focus and effort back again to do what I really want to do.  I have that quote on a white board in my office because that is the core of what we face to keep creating no matter what.<br /><br />Terrific book. My book is stained and tattered because of its power to revive. I can't recommend it strongly enough.

B001P9KR8U|3.0|If most Americans are like me, they will associate the term \\"slumdog\\" with the term \\"slumlord,\\" as in a  \\"dog of a slumlord. I initially thought the word referred to a \\"slumlord dog\\" -- that is a slumlord that had a doggish reputation for failing to keep up run-down properties rented to the poor at unseemly profits. However, \\"slumdog,\\" in the context of Indian society, is a derogatory label given to the lowest of the \\"untouchable caste:\\" the mostly street orphans and wretched waifs and urban denizens that rule the streets by day and night and live on (and off of) the dumps of trash of most Indian cities.<br /><br />The plot, upon which the movie hangs, is the story of an endearing \\"slumdog\\" named Jamal who upon reaching adulthood, accidently manages to get on the Indian version of \\"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. \\" And as he progresses up the ladder towards the magic jackpot, the host becomes suspicious and reports him to the local authorities on suspicions of cheating. As a result, the game show contestant is called into the nearest police station for interrogation. And the rest of the movie consists of flashbacks of the interrogation, which soon reveals that, associated with each of his answers, is a corresponding incident in Jamal's earlier life as a street urchin, that predicts with a certainty to each of his correct answers. The cleverness of the movie is that the game show motif becomes just a pretext for exposing the many horrors of the violence of poverty of Jamal's childhood as a \\"slumdog\\" on the streets of Mumbai, and by extension it is a broader expose of the poverty of the underclass of Indian society, more generally.<br /><br />Despite my initial apprehensions about the movie after misunderstanding the true meaning of the term \\"slumdog,\\" I wanted to be seduced by this movie. But this was not to be. For the movie shocked me into a corrected understanding of the term \\"slumdog\\" with a negative act of symbolic vulgarness that could be interpreted in only oneway: as the dark mean-spirited political undertones of a \\"caste-conscious\\" culture.<br /><br />The incident in question involves a prank by his friends, in which the eight year-old, Jamal gets locked in an outhouse and he has no exit except to take the dive and come up through the toilet hole dripping with fecal slime from head to toe. He then proceeds to run smiling through a crowded street with hundreds of other kids, and somehow manages to get the signature of his movie hero, still draped unnoticed by the crowd in this dripping, stinking, unhealthy fecal robe.<br /><br />What a metaphor for an uncaring society!<br /><br />This scene is the most powerful, if not the pivotal scene of the movie, because symbolically it sets the context, the subtext and the pretext of the rather thin and syrupy melodrama that follows. Next to this opening image, the quiz show motif is little more than a handy vehicle for \\"allowing\\" the wretched \\"to be seen\\" achieving a modicum of success in a society where it is fully recognized that it is next to impossible to do so.  A society where the only normal routes to \\"upward mobility\\" for these \\"outcasts\\" is crime and scheming. The callousness of Indian society is normalized through the shock treatment of the \\"outhouse scene\\" and then thereafter relegated to the background. After the fecal robe parade, nothing about Indian society can be more shocking or vulgar. This one scene inoculates Indian society from any responsibility for what happens to its poor.<br /><br />With this shock treatment, it is difficult not to be disturbed throughout the movie by this image of an eight year old walking in public dripping in a fecal robe. For in my mind, that robe points to the deeper and darker political motives of the moviemakers: After that scene, it is no longer an uplifting comedy, but a mean-spirited behind the scene \\"caste conscious\\" political movie manipulated by the upper classes to maintain the rules of the status quo intact, even as it weaves an unreal story of improbable success for a slumdog. And although it's deeper and darker political messages are cleverly tucked behind the syrupy facile melodramatic Bollywood quiz show motif, one that ends happily with the street urchin getting the girl and living happily ever after, the movie is fun, only if you turn your blinders off to the savagery of the poverty and violence of everyday life of the Indian underclass. I could not.<br /><br />The unmistakable message embedded in the context is that no one cares that millions of orphaned kids run around each day in wretched, violent poverty, having their limbs severed and their eyes gouged out, their organs sold, all for profits for those on the next level up the class ladder. No one cares if they run the streets with no clothes, no where to live, even in fecal robes. The point of the movie is to desensitize the moviegoer to the fact that in India, poverty is like the grass, a part of the national landscape, most Indians are over it: so the movie's appeal is for the moviegoer to also to just get over it too. Some of us could not.<br /><br />The subtext is equally clear, the movie attempts to expose, even as it \\"tiptoes around\\" the edges of the \\"uber sensitivities\\" of the caste warfare going on today, the utter hopelessness of trying to rise above ones own station in Indian society. Although the motif of \\"fictionally allowing\\" the wretched to rise up for a fleeting moment of \\"upward mobility\\" via a TV game show is clever, it belies the truth of Indian society. Plus, that triumph is accidental and occurs by societal and artistic fiat, and even under these odd circumstances, still the success immediately comes under suspicion as involving some kind of \\"slumdog\\" trickery.<br /><br />If this shallow, slick, movie wins an Oscar I will be very disappointed.<br /><br />Three stars
B001EOQWEO|5.0|CAUTION: REVIEW CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS!!      At first glance (as well as the first time I saw previews for this film) I was thinking \\"Oh boy, not another dumb Disney film with pointless characters and overdone CGI.\\"     Not so! In fact, this film is the furthest from that. Yes, if you take the film at face-value, sure enough you'll find that the above statement is 100% true. On the other hand, if you take the opportunity and time (not, by the way-wasted) you'll find that this film is layered with comments about our current society and its possible future problems.     But first, let me give a premise for the film:     This film is as much about a little robot named Wall-E and his adventure in finding the people who left earth and bringing them back, as well as finding his first crush, Eve.     Within the film are several product placements: Eve- who represents the Mac and Wall-E who represents the PC in some ways (except for his recharging sound being the sound of a  Mac computer-starting up). The contrast of course is this sleek, shiny, clean, new robot who arrives and Wall-E for the first time realizes, for better or for worse, how desolate his job really is.     Wall-E, unlike his fellow workers (also called \\"Wall-E\\") has outlasted the 700 years of sandstorms and garbage pick-up. With Eve's arrival, Wall-E finally has someone to share his world (and collection of human utensils) with. He shows her a number of items- all commonly used today- but not on the Star-Liner \\"The Axiom\\" where all food and beverages are drunk through a cup (gross).     After Eve presents her finding- (the plant Wall-E originally found for his collection on Earth and showed to Eve) to the Captain and the AUTO-Pilot, a mutiny begins to brew. The AUTO-Pilot is on his own directive to never allow humans to return to earth. Whereas Eve is determined to take the plant to the hollow-detector. Wall-E, not understanding this, causes chaos and confusion among the orderly robots and ship. Eventuallyit is the chaos of Wall-E and Eve's final acceptance of Wall-E's naivete and at the end- courage to help her fulfill her directive.     Now, the aesthetic creativity in this film begins with the first 30 minutes of the film being silent except for Wall-E's occasional noises. Otherwise there is no dialogue until their trek to the AXIOM. The film is full of subtleties: for example- when the Probe-Ship leaves the Earth it blasts through an atmosphere of satellites and probes. Yes, our lovely \\"Blue\\" earth does look like that. We've been shooting so much junk or trash into space (like the Giant Wall-E bots do on the AXIOM)that our Earth looks like it's been infested with satellitis (satellite disease, not an actual disease- but still).     Additionally, the U.S. in particular has a huge laziness and technology problem. This is made evident by the fact that the entire AXIOM's activities are virtual and the people interact through computers and screens when their friends or family are right next to them. No one is aware of their ability to walk or that there are such things as a pool.     Basic terms and foods become obsolete in the future because robots have replaced our need to do things ourselves. Wall-E's chasing of Eve (and as a result the uniting of two people: Mary and John- who experience real emotions for the first time- and interaction face to face without a console in between).     Also, the film has amazing sounds, an incredible score, and the closing song \\"Down to Earth\\" by Peter Gabriel tops the charts! The DVD includes commentary on the film as well as on the sounds made in the film. Find out how the makers created Eve's laser or the ship's sound as it takes off from Earth! (It's really amazing- some are even so simple it's funny).    I could name all the references in the film (I've bought this very DVD)and watched it many times. I can see no reason why it can't be viewed on the same par as the Best Picture Nominations.     In fact, I think it is the bestfilm of the year and deserves to win all six of its nominations as well as Best Picture.    So, maybe you've seen it once and went \\"Well, there's no talking...\\" I'd say \\"SHUT UP AND WATCH THE FILM!\\" Because it is a piece of artwork and not another Hollywood entertainer with overdone CGI and doesn't require you to think.     Think you must, Talk you mustn't. - Is what Yoda would have said if he saw this film.
B001HZK8FY|4.0|I would not suggest buying this boxed set. I LOVE this film, it's probably my favourite film of all time. However, I purchased it believing there would be more to it than the stickers, stationary, and bookmarks it comes with. Yes, it does have a little collector's book (how nice) BUT I am a fan of the story, so for me, I would have liked to see more DVD extras instead of the paper stuff it came with.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you already own the DVD of this, then you already own this version as well--it's the SAME exact copy as what was released 4 years ago, you just get a pretty box and some paper to write on.......so save your money.
0440238609|5.0|For years I've had my own ideas about how the universe works and was fascinated to find some of my ideas reflected in these books. The worlds and characters were engaging and fascinating -- You have witches and armored polar bears and a Texan who rides in a balloon, people who see their souls in the form of animals... It sound outlandish, but they come together beautifully. I managed to read all three books in just three days because I couldn't put them down. As other reviews have said, this is not children's literature -- young adult at the earliest. To understand much of the series you need to have some reference points in Christian theology -- specifically the concept of original sin -- and in the spotted history of the organized church.    If you are familiar with the many worlds theory, the premise of the books is easy to understand. There is a strong anti-church/organized religion theme throughout the books so people with strong religious beliefs --including the belief that reading ideas that don't correspond with the bible are 'satanic' or 'evil' -- will not appreciate this series. The moral of the series, however, is profound. You won't regret reading these books.
B000JLTRKE|1.0|How could Oliver Stone and Nicholas Cage work on a story that literally changed America and NOT have a \\"signifcant film\\" and a sure fire Oscar Winner?  Perhaps Stone was a victim of a global conspiracy.  As far as Nicholas Cage, he was totally underutilized and useless as basically a lump under some rubble with his best line being, \\"I don't talk much.\\"  Obviously, of the films budget slated for actors, the lion's share went to Cage since there were no other recognizable actors of significance.  The script was so abyssmal it lead to a seemingly endless movie that just plodded along.  The best thing I can say about this movie was that it was over and I could place the DVD in trash were it belongs.[[ASIN:B000JLTRKE World Trade Center (Widescreen Edition)]]
B000UR9T82|5.0|Anyone looking to purchase this trilogy is already a fan of the SPIDERMAN movies and wants to know how they stand up in the magic of blu ray.  We all know that the original SPIDERMAN was an amzing film - a rare treat of exemplary action with superb acting for a change.  Tobey Maguire and cast finally brought to the comic action movie acting ability that made the film believable.  With Tobey Maguire was born Peter Parker/Spdiderman.  We also know that with SPIDERMAN 2 the same cast and crew came together with a film that far surpassed the hugely succesful and critically acclaimed original to be the best in the trilogy.  All that was good in the first was raised many notches.  SPIDERMAN 3 was still a good film but certainly not a match for 1 and 2.  Very enjoyable but a little lackluster in comparison.<br /><br />Now for the blu ray test. All I can say is AMAZING.  The source they are working from on the original is not as superb as the other two which makes the picture quality slightly grainy in its 1080p hd presentation.  But this in no means is a bad thing.  It is still a very vivid picture with blacks and colors strongly presented.  You quickly get used to the slight grain and the film becomes the best presentation you will ever see of it.  With SPIDERMAN 2 the caliber raises.  All grain is gone and the picture remains crystal clear and vibrant throughout.  All fight/action scenes are awesome and the entire film will leave you breathless.  SPIDERMAN 3 has  a picture of the great quality the same as the second film and it helps immensely to raise the quality of the film itself much higher for you will be in awe watching the richness and awe striking special effects.<br /><br />With all three films the English Dolby TrueHD 5.1 audio is of the highest quality.  Dialogue is strong and crisp with all speakers in strong, heavy use for action sequences and it seems even the smallest scenes manage to work the rear speakers which is rare.  These three films are at their best here and perfectly made for the high standards of blu ray.  You cannot imagine how great these films appear in blu ray till you actually see them for yourself.  You will never be able to view them another way again.<br /><br />I do agree that the only flaw with this set is the absence of substantial special features.  They do provide the 2nd disc with SPIDERMAN 3 that is all features but do not have it for SPIDERMAN 1 or 2.  Having all this would have made the set perfect.  So it is not perfect but it still cannot make me lower my 5 star rating for the blu ray presentation of these films is exemplary.<br /><br />If you are developing a blu ray library and love these films this SPIDERMAN HIGH DEF BLU RAY TRILOGY is a definite must.  Highly recommended.ectly made for the high standards of blu ray.  You cannot imagine how great these films appear in blu ray till you actually see them for yourself.

B001KL3GY0|5.0|When I first heard this I was a but puzzled...was it worth the 3 year wait? Now I've heard it several times and I and COMPLETELY satisfiied...I love that they are experimenting and making music that maybe I don't understand the first time I hear it. Hey they're the band... they should make  music THEY like and WE have to catch up to THEM.   I think listening to LUCID DREAMS  (CD version) must be similar to what it was like to listen to Revolution # 9 from The White Album in 1968. Weird..I don't get it...but I like it...I think...This CD is GREAT in headphones...all kinds of little nuances...sometimes the vocals suddenly sound like Alex Kapranos is whispering in you ear. And Congrats for keeping it to 40 or so minutes...It really seems like an ALBUM and not just a collection of songs to fill the 80 minute CD length
0765348276|5.0|Briefly, this is a brilliant page-turner of a novel, somehow combining themes redolent of classic Heinlien and Haldeman, with accents of Hemingway, Stephen King, Dale Carnegie and even a little Danielle Steele!    Almost any detail shared herein raises the spectre of being a plot spoiler, so I'll keep my comments brief; -  I found the introduction a touch 'uphill sledding' for the first few pages, but it soon became apparent that Mr. Scalzi was merely using this dialogue and narrative to set up the plot, and make the whole thing flow so readily thereafter.  I was also a tad disappointed about the end....it seems to me that authors lately have lost the knack of allowing a book to wrap up without being set up for a sequel. Annoying! Sequels are fine, and I surely look forward to one or two in the same vein as this, but dammit, bring all of your threads together tidily as part of the conclusion, please!  Having critiqued the only parts that I took issue with, it must be emphasized just how enjoyable a read this book truly is.   I was SO absorbed, almost every other activity went by the wayside whilst I read it, staying awake the whole night, and quite forgetting to eat!  Additional to the grand yarn storytelling, the author explores the chasm between the members of the military and the public they're pledged to defend, which given the current efforts of the US Military ('America's Military is at war, but most of Main St USA is at lunch.....) is a very piquante perspective.  All in all...read it. Read it soon. FIERCELY reccomended!
0393327655|4.0|This is great for expelling religion, but where I agree with Sam on these issues, his hard nosed line on politics based on religion is another issue.<br /><br />As some reviewers have pointed out, Sam has somehow done what he criticizes the religious of doing: being contradictory (and that is the nice way of saying it). To end religion because of its killing by potentially torturing and killing the religious is practically what is laid out on the table.<br /><br />Someone who writes so eloquently on faith based religion has been blinded by the very thing he argues. That is, Sam finds a way to justify hate (i.e. torture) to repress religious hate (in this case it really is ok to torture to get the location of the nuclear bomb because morally it is ok to torture one rather than sacrifice potential thousands). It sounds like Sam got together with John Yoo and Alberto Gonzalez as consultants on this one.<br /><br />In short, I agree 100% with Sam on religion and dogmatism. In fact, he has inspired me to keep up the \\"good fight\\" against the devout as of recent. Where I have to \\"agree to disagree\\" with him is on the issues of politics based on religious views.<br /><br />p.s. If you want a searing expose on religion, check out his second work \\"Letter to a christian nation.\\" Its extremely easy reading and leaves out all of the political dialogue.
1416550518|5.0|Normally, when I've finished reading a book, I give it away.  Not this one -- it's a keeper.  A subtle mystery that keeps one guessing till the very end.  The surprise last page answered my questions about Grace's education.  The descriptions of the various time periods were right on target -- allowing the reader to go back in time.  I LOVED THIS BOOK!  I can't wait to read The Forgotten Garden.
B001HUHBAE|5.0|Wow.  The blu ray presentation of ZODIAC is absolutely spectacular and everything that was great about this film is exemplified 100% as blu ray is used to its fullest effect.  This film has always been a 5 star outing for me.  It takes a new approach to true crime and instead follows the lengthy journey of police and reporters as they follow the leads and try to find the mysterious Zodiac killer.  The ensemble cast is exemplary with all doing some of their best work.  Some of the killings are shown and they are done without over the top gore.  Instead they are realistically shot which instills an even greater fear into the viewer.  When the killer approaches a couple and the woman exclaims \\"He has a gun !!\\" my insides quiver as if it was happening to me.<br /><br />The film manages to follow the history of the Zodiac's killings while being a police procedural and investigative piece all at the same time.  The viewer feels how each characters life is involved with and changed by this case.  There is trepidation, suspense and great drama with a superb script and amazing directing.<br /><br />Now, back to the blu ray version of this film.  This is a brand new release and I needed an update on my blu ray player to view it.  Very easy to do.  And the 1080 high def pic is striking.  The visual clarity is amazing and darks, brights, etc. are all excellent.  Day and night scenes are both just as vibrant.  And the 5.1 Dolby TrueHD audio is amazing.  This seems to be a film basically dialogue driven but all 5 speakers are put to amazing use here.  The dialogue is totally crisp and this film also possesses an amazing score of 70s music. It comes from all the speakers as does city background noise.  All 5 speakers are continuously in use.  It is as if viewing the film for the 1st time and I was in awe.  This audion track makes the film a new experience.<br /><br />And for me this 2 disc Director's cut is the first blu ray to take advantage and provide exemplary special features.  There is an extensive commentary with the film and disc 2 contains a documentary on the making of the film, an in depth look at the prime suspect thru real participants in the search and most importantly an almost 2 hour feature length documentary THIS IS THE ZODIAC SPEAKING which chronicles every aspect of the investigation including in depth interviews with even surviving victims.  All the special features are presented in HD and are worth the price of this set in themselves.<br /><br />This film is a quality piece of work and this 2 disc Directors Cut blu ray shows blu ray at its best and is a must.  I highly recommend it.commentary with the film and disc 2 contains a documentary on the making of the film, an in depth look at the prime suspect thru real participants in the search and most importantly an almost 2 hour feature length documentary THIS IS THE ZODIAC SPEAKING which chronicles every aspect of the investigation including in depth interviews with even surviving victims.

The camera angles are outstanding,detail is  great in hi-def,but the sound just blew me away. If you can't enjoy the lossless audio format do yourself a favor and upgrade your system. You won't be dissapointed. Movies are so real and if bands continue to do blu-ray discs of their tours,well,man oh man we're in for the best audio era since stereophonic recording became the norm!
0375826726|2.0|This is the best book in the Eragon series yet - Paolini has expanded his writing abilities and thus the storyline is much improved in this latest book.  However it seems that his editors have chosen to given him more rein in his writing, which was a mistake.  There is a lot an experienced editor should have requested rewritten to help the flow of the book and keep the book from being just a boy's fantasy.<br /><br />Here's a simple example that suggests the editors are on holiday: the word \\"whom\\" is consistently misused throughout the whole book.  I know it is very minor, but I grit my teeth every time I read it and I wonder if such a simple mistake is because there was no editorial support.<br /><br />I say this is the best book in the series yet because there has certainly been a change in Paolini.  While Brisingr is still violent, the earlier books didn't distinguish that killing was wrong.  Finally we see the character Eragon is taking more responsibility for his actions and feeling some regret for the taking of lives.  It would have been a character flaw if he hadn't.  I suppose this started to change in the last book but it comes through better in this one.<br /><br />The writing style has improved, but there is still farther to go.  A wedding on the same day of death and defeat?  The way things like this are portrayed make the story seem naive.  This book may be for teens but that doesn't mean the story should sacrifice in how it is written.  I think Paolini will be a great writer, say in ten or fifteen more years.  For now however, he still needs an editor and his books stand out without being great.

B001GCUNVW|4.0|Stories that delved into the inner human spirit and tales about redemption have been beloved by critics since anyone can remember. Small wonder, since films that exhibit pure humanity can undoubtedly touch the hearts of audiences--it is a premise that is both fascinating and quite easy to relate to. Inspired by the documentary \\"Beyond the Mat\\", director Darren Aronofsky's \\"The WRESTLER\\" is a film with a lot of things to say, and may well be Mickey Rourke's best performance; this role may indeed serve as his own redemption as his own character's--Randy the \\"Ram\\".<br /><br />Randy (Mickey Rourke) is an aging, washed out wrestler whose days of glory and fame are over. Now wrestling in a small circuit that is mostly staged in small or large auditoriums, Randy is having some difficulties keeping up with the younger talent. To keep up, he uses an abundance of pain killers and strength enhancers. One day, after performing in a \\"hardcore match\\", Randy suffers a heart attack which causes him to undergo a bypass surgery and ends his weekend wrestling career. Randy is now all alone, and needs to make a living. Afraid of being alone, he befriends a beautiful stripper named Cassidy (Marisa Tomei) and tries to rekindle his relationship with his daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood). Working in a small supermarket, Randy tries to make ends meet. However, it is difficult for a man to change overnight and Randy imperils his one chance to redeem himself...or is it him accepting his fate?<br /><br />Mickey Rourke is an underrated actor. I remember him in his younger days in \\"9 ½ weeks\\", and his most recent appearance in the awesome \\"Sin City\\". He always has that signature raspy voice that gives him a lot of character. In this film, you will hardly recognize him (as in Sin City), his face is so beaten up much like a boxer, his eyes display a feeling of dread and sadness as to what his future might bring. Rourke is much older and he seems poised to give this film everything he has left in his performance. \\"The Wrestler's\\" main strength will have to come from Rourke himself. There is quite a good number of touching moments most notably his teary-eyed conversation with his daughter, and the film's final act. Rourke shines through, and delivers in fleshing out his character.<br /><br />This film may well be a character study of a washed out wrestler, but the film also offers something very significant and serves as the soul of the film. Randy's attempts to begin a new relationship with another \\"outcast\\" of society--a stripper (played by Beauteous Marisa Tomei). Their developing romance is fully realized as these two have a lot in common. They made mistakes in some of their deeds in life, now they are both middle-aged and they fear the future. Randy is desperate not to be alone and Cassidy is being careful not to commit another mistake, why would she date someone who obviously is almost same? If you're a screw-up, why would you want another screw-up to share your life with? It was ingenious for Aronofsky to carefully illustrate their similar situations in a subtle manner--both are losing ground each day, Randy's career as a wrestler and Cassidy's days as a stripper are both winding down. Their days of having high returns is almost over, now their careers are bringing a low yield.<br /><br />The supporting cast is remarkably impressive. However, limited Evan Rachel Wood's screen time was, it serves as a catalyst for the film's final resolution. Wood displays raw frustration and anger in her confrontations with her father. Of course, aside from Rourke, Marisa Tomei is the film's heart. Her performance is indeed quite daring and Oscar-worthy. Tomei's portrayal of a middle-aged stripper is so full of energy and emotional mood. Marisa is an underused actress since she won an Oscar for \\"My Cousin Vinny\\". Cassidy is a complex woman, she wants more from her life, but it seems like this is the only choice she can make to support her son. Marisa is alluring and convincing in her portrayal.<br /><br />The screenplay by Robert Siegel is nearly excellent, it was simple but truly effective in what it was trying to say. There are also some subtle hints that Randy had been grasping to the past--his collection of VHS tapes, an older Nintendo game console, even his stereo all express the idea that he had stood still while time had moved on. It also displays the \\"brotherhood\\" outside the ring,  younger wrestlers look up to him, and definitely shows him respect. The cinematography by Maryse Alberti is kept simple and intentionally made with a grainy look, to give it a feeling of a documentary. The backdrop is full of nostalgic touches to flesh out its characters-- the old beat up, abandoned beach where Randy takes his daughter, the dark, gloomy bars are all indications that he is a bruised and battered \\"piece of meat\\" according to Randy himself.<br /><br />The film's greatest asset will have to be its simplicity in execution. It is a true piece of life's great stories and Rourke's performance is the film's selling point. The final act is a simple but effective exclamation point that director Aronofsky exudes the film's remarkable message without being overly sentimental. \\"The Wrestler\\" is an emotionally involving, compelling piece that displays skill and decorum in its simple storytelling. While the film is a little depressing, it is also very sensitive and sweet that leaves a warm sensation after the end credits have finished.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!

B0002HMQUS|5.0|Solid, well made product. Have confidence will outlast me and my camera. Wonder which of my kids I should will this to!
1572816112|5.0|I am a beginner and was hesitant to buy these because of the review.  I was drawn to them though so went ahead and purchased them.  They are wonderful and I have to disagree with the review that said they were not for beginners.  I took a on line course to make myself aware of the Tarot and also read a book to make myself more familar with it.  I studied daily to become familar with the card and their meanings.  I worked with the cards and their meaning were very clear to me by the pictures displayed on the cards.  These will be my favorite cards for a long time and I recommend them to anyone who feels drawn to them whether they are a rookie or experienced in Tarot.
B001EO748M|5.0|After viewing Season 1 of the Tudors I waited in anxious anticipation for the second season to be released, I was not disappointed. It was absolutely great. I would recommend this to anyone who has a fasination with Henry VIII. The actors are great and keep you so interested in the story line. I have watched it many time. I am looking forward to seeing Season 3,4,5 & 6. Which I have read that Showtime will be doing. Buy the  current 2 seasons and ENJOY !!!!!!!  5 STARS in my book.
B0000542D2|3.0|The Movie: 5 Out of 5 Stars   A Hard Day's Night is timeless. There are beautiful songs and the free spirit of the 1960s. Not only is it an interesting watch for Beatles Fans, but everyone as well. It shows how free-spirited someone can be. Along the way, the Beatles encounter disapproving adults and other authority figures, who prefer not to look and act to the free-spirited way of the time. The movie is truly a great, yet simple movie.    The Releases: MPI DVD vs Miramax DVD  MPI-4 Stars  Miramax-2 Stars   A Hard Day's Night was not the movie with the highest budget. The sound was monaural originally, not stereo.  It was also shot on Academy Ratio (close to full screen), not a Widescreen Ratio. It was meant to be a kind of artsy black and white movie. When, it was released, the soundtrack was very over-modulated. This was to make everything as loud as possible (maybe so people can hear over screaming fans in the movie theater).  In other word, it was very distorted when first released in 1964.   In 1982, A Hard Day's Night was released once again in theaters. This time in Dolby Stereo. This was done by taking the stereo studio versions of the song and using them to replace the original ones in the mono soundtrack. It also used a prologue of pictures of the Beatles with \\"I'll Cry Instead\\" playing. MPI and Criterion had various releases of a Hard Day's Night on VHS, Laserdisc, and Betamax from 1984-1995. Most releases used a certain master, possibly a copy or slight variation from the Dolby Stereo Reissue Mix; however, the earliest ones used a bettered original mono mix. It was also restored in the 90s and shown in the AMC Film Festival with the original full screen ratio and a restored mono mix. The AMC version is considered by most to be the definitive version.   In the late 1990s, A Hard Day's Night was once again restored very thoroughly. The picture was restored and most cracks or specks in the film were repaired. The person who restored A Hard Day's Night wanted a better soundtrack. He deemed the original soundtrack unacceptable since it was over-modulated. He decided to use the Reissue Soundtrack. He restored it very well. However, since this used the stereo version of the songs rather than the soundtrack, when George knocked over an amplifier during \\"If I Fell,\\" no thud was heard. It included the 1982 Reissue Prologue and had a full screen ratio. This restoration was released as the MPI DVD. The release included some trailers and the Running, Jumping, and Standing Still Film.   A Hard Day's Night was once again restored in the new millennium. This restoration used a copy of the original over-modulated soundtracks, now the thud could be heard when George knocks over the amplifier since it is the original soundtrack. During the restoration, the already over-modulated soundtrack was turned into some fake hollow 5.1 surround sound. Notice that there is no outro instruments at the end of \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" when the train is moving away like in the MPI Release. You just hear the crowd's commotion rather than the rather nice outro fading out slowly over it in the MPI release. The picture was restored very thoroughly and is the best quality. Due to widescreen becoming popular, the picture was reframed into widescreen, cutting off a lot of the top and bottom plus exposing some unnecessary picture on the sides. This is probably not what Richard Lester, the director, intended. This was the master used for the Miramax DVD. The release contained some very pointless interviews with people who are NOT the Beatles.
031606792X|5.0|Stephenie Meyer is a genius! She has a way of making the books come to life. Page after page adds to the excitement, making it hard to put down!! I couldn't wait to finish the series and now I wish she continue with at least one more book!! Highly recommended for teens and above!!!
0553573411|5.0|I must start by saying that I thoroughly enjoyed book two, a bit more than one, though that was a 4 star book. I would have liked to see more expansion on the magic elements of the story, and suspect that is to come in book 3. But having said that, Fits has grown into an amazing and durable character. Challenged by faith, stamina, and character in ways we can not imagine enduring ourselves. Prince Regal goes to extreme lengths to grasp and claw for power, even to gain the throne. Night Eyes the wolf has a jaw dropping surprise to aid Fitz. All the multilayerd characters develop nicely into believable people you care about. Robin Hobb has it right, this trilogy will become a permanent part of my library to be enjoyed over and over.
B000000OSE|1.0|How did GnR fall so far in only one album. It usually takes a band several albums before their creativity peaks(im looking at you Metallica). How does a band gain legend status by having one classic album and one(yes one album, dont try and tell me illusion I and II are separate, it was just a way for the record company to bleed the fans) truly awful, overproduced, pretentious, ego-maniacal, train wreck. There is one AND ONLY one song worth listening to and that is You could be Mine. It could have easily been included on Appetite for Destruction and should have been the direction taken by Axel and Co. Just think of what could have been.
B000VSBX34|5.0|Help is a great comedy that is very entertaining; however, I can imagine that some people would find this movie corny and campy. The picture quality is excellent and looks like it was restored in High Definition. There are no specks or scrathes in the picture. Since widescreen is the main format now, this was reframed for widescreen even though the original ratio was much closer to full screen. The 5.1 surround sound is nice, but some great Beatles collectors might not approve. Rather than using the original mono sound, this uses a 5.1 surround sound with the songs' audio derived from the stereo studio sound.
B000LXHK2C|3.0|Fun romantic comedy with the high points being the beautiful French countryside and a very good soundtrack. Yep, I bought the CD, too.
B000FS9MV0|5.0|It took too long for this follow-up album to be released, but it's definitely worth the wait.  Renee, just months short of her twentieth birthday, hits the mark, scores a bull's eye, again!  Song choices are a brilliant display of her vocal prowess; her approach to each shows that she's an original with unmatched maturity.  When hopeful songstresses on American Idol seem to want to scream at the top of their collective lungs, it's nice to have a talent such as Renee's take both standards and originals and give each her very personal stamp, focusing on interpretation rather than sheer volume.  Under the tutelage of the likes of David Foster once again and the added talents of Humberto Gatica, Renee gives her fans an early Valentine gift...a group of songs which showcase her awesome young talent.  No need to single any selection out...you'll enjoy them all.  And here's hoping that her next release won't take the length of time to put together that this one has taken, although if this is what the wait has been for...putting together a group of songs that SHE'S proud of...then the wait is very much worth it!
0312857063|5.0|So far I have not been disappointed with the series, I only hope I can say that when I am done. So far though it is awesome which is especially significant because I rarely can bring myself to read when there are other things I could be doing. Yet with these books it is hard to turn away.
031606792X|5.0|The book was FANTASTIC, as was the entire series. New Moon was my least favorite. I am hoping the author will continue this series with a new book!
B001J1O848|4.0|\\"Taken\\" is a workmanlike action-packed thriller directed by Pierre Morel and starring the excellent Liam Neeson as Bryan Mills, a retired and divorced CIA agent with a daughter he dotes on.

B001974DG0|5.0|This was the first Dean Koontz book that I read (abot nine years ago)and since I have been a hardcore fan of Dean Koontz. He is one of the best writers in my opinion and this is just one of his greatest books.
0385339585|5.0|I read this when I was in high school for a book report and fell in love with reading. This book has changed every way I look at reading. The story line is great along with the adventure in the story. Perfect for anyone looking for a book they won't be able to put down.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|[Edit December 2013]<br />I still own my original model of this product and it is still working flawlessly. The gaming software has undergone a few updates, all of which have added some nice functionality. This has been a reliable and durable product over the years and I am still very happy with it.<br />[End update]<br /><br />This review is somewhat lengthy, but I try to cover all the bases on this device.<br /><br />Overall Impression: Very nice piece of hardware, worth the money.<br /><br />Ok, let's get started.<br />Physical Properties: The pad itself is of decent size for someone with average to slightly-larger-than average hands. I have long fingers and still felt very comfortable on this device. The keys press easily and are in a comfortable layout. The joystick also moves easily with my thumb. However, the joystick has a \\"click\\" attached to it when you press it down which is somewhat difficult to activate while keeping the stick still. It's definitely a hard press.<br /><br />There is a non-slip surface on the bottom to keep the unit in place which works perfectly, as well as a comfortable semi-nonslip on the wrist/palm rest.<br /><br />The LCD is clear and brightly illuminated with customizable lighting. There is also an on/off button for the backlight built onto the unit so you don't have to play with lights on all the time. The backlight for the LCD also backlights the buttons, which means that they follow the same customizable functionality.<br /><br />The LCD also displays various, customizable, information based upon applications you have running on your system. It has support for all the mainstream media players to display song information, as well as RSS information, email, etc. It also has the capability to display in-game information, but the game itself must support this. Warhammer, for instance, does not offer this support (that I've seen), so there are no vitals displayed on the LCD. World of Warcraft does offer support, so by default you cansee quite a number of stats on your screen.<br /><br />Software:<br />The G13 has its own software for assigning functions to the keypad. It also has an application dedicated to managing the LCD display. I have not used any other LCD / Programmable Logitech products in the past so I don't know how this compares with them.<br /><br />In the software suite, you can scan your computer for available known games to the G13. I did not have luck with it finding my WAR installation, but I changed the default directory which could be the cause of this.<br /><br />If it finds compatible games it will then make available a preconfigured gaming profile for that game. You are of course allowed to modify the profile if you wish or you can choose to create your own custom profile from scratch.<br /><br />The profile creation is easy. It involves choosing a name and the game/application executable file.<br /><br />Once you have a new profile, you can choose what to assign to your keys. Your options are key combinations, macros, or scripts. The software makes assigning each of these a snap. It only takes point and click to assign your keys under the profile, which is auto-saved.<br /><br />The software is also where you are allowed to modify the LCD backlight color. Using the windows built-in color chooser, you can select any value of RGB to backlight your unit with. Each memory setting (1 - 3) can have its own backlight. This gives you an easy way to distinguish quickly which profile you're on.<br /><br />Macros:<br />Macroing on the G13 is pretty straightforward. You can launch the macro editor and begin recording keystrokes and mouse clicks and then save them into the macro list. You are then able to assign the macros to G-keys on the board. The macro editor also allows you to add custom durations between events in the macro you're recording, or it can record durations between keypresses as you do them. I find it easier to record the macro first and then add delays later. This isvery helpful for Warhammer since it has a global cooldown on all skills.<br /><br />Scripting:<br />The G13 has an implementation of the LUA scripting language available for use. It includes most of the math libraries, strings, and some tables. Using the LUA language, and some custom Logitech event functionality (which are documented) you can create scripts to drive almost any aspect of the G13. They allow you to control the LCD, moving the mouse, emulating keypresses, etc. Once you create a script, you can assign it to a G-key very easily by choosing it from a list.<br /><br />I think that about covers the G13. I am very pleased with having spent the money to order it. Something to keep in mind. The G13 is fantastic for gaming, but also has many practical uses outside of gaming. As a programmer, I find the G13 works well inside of my IDE for quickly running commands (compiling, debug, synchronization, etc).<br /><br />I hope this helps you out! I am also not affiliated with Logitech in any way, but I do like their product.
B00005JO5L|1.0|Impossible to watch. Incredibly hate-filled.  The homophobia oozes off every frame.  The heterosexual world, all bright and clean, spacious, daylit, bright colors.  The gay world, all dark and sordid, cramped, dark colored. Gay people, a few campy queens, but mostly leering, threatening wackos.      But the fascinating part is listening to the commentaries and watching the director and producer today DEFENDING their hatred.  They actually tried to frame themselves as victims of their illiterate, anti-art protestors!     Of course you have the right to any disgusting, dehumanizing opinion that you please, but applauding the murder of gay people, or even the monsters this movie refers to as gay, is hate speech.
B00005B4GT|4.0|Radiohead is awesome but you either love them or don't. Amnesiac is their hardest album to get into as it takes many listens to really understand whats going on. (Kid A, Amnesiac's sister album, is far easier to get into) When I saw that everything was being re-released on vinyl, I jumped at the chance to grab all of the main albums. My only complaint here is the 10\\" size. It causes too much disc flipping. I understand why Radiohead did it this way, the album does lend itself to shorter bursts and the songs at the beginning/end of each side feel right. I would however, have preferred a 2 disc 12\\" with the fourth side empty. It would just have been more convenient.
0618918248|4.0|An incredibly engaging, well thought-out, feverishly sourced and researched bit of writing. Though this book may not be, on the surface, everyone's cup of tea, I highly suggest that you read. Whether you're a card-carrying atheist or a fundamentalist believer, this is essential reading. For the former, it will give well-constructed arguments against the existence of god (and its insights will make you sound a lot more informed should you get ever get in a head theology debate); for the latter if will give an intelligent, thoughtful and yes, sometimes sarcastic, re-examining of centuries-old traditions and superstitions and why science and a humanistic, logical, democratic view of the world and its people is more constructive, progressive and ultimately practical than religion. If ever you've doubted your faith, you need to read this book.<br /><br />However, I will admit that Dawkins is a little too giddily impressed with his vast knowledge of biology, evolution, philosophy, sociology, etc. But if you can get past some of the outright sneering, you can get at the meat. This is an essential read for anyone questioning the status quo.
B000PY52EU|2.0|Other reviews have written about the plot which is pure gumball and at the end of the film you wonder why did you bothered.  It lacks credibility however in parts there are bits that get you in and the acting in some segments is enough to hold you in your seat.<br /><br />Overall its 20% bleeding heart plot, 60% facile and that leaves 20% where the actors actually do a good job despite the direction and context of the whole plot, and the biggest surprise for me was Justin Timberlake.  Why he took a role in this movie I don't know but for what it had to be I thought that he did a good job.
0143038583|5.0|What a fascinating book! The author, Michael Pollan, begins by noting an American paradox (Page 3): \\". . .a notably unhealthy people obsessed by the idea of living healthily.\\" He examines three different food chains--from beginning to end, from the plants to a full meal at diner.<br /><br />So, there are three parts to the book, one for each of the food chains: the industrial, organic, and hunter-gatherer. The first part, the industrial, begins with the history of corn (and its dependence on human presence for success), how corn is grown, how it is used, and how it affects out meals at the end of the day. While we may not eat the corn grown in the field, the products of corn feed cattle, create food additives, and so on. Indeed, he points out that about ¼ of the items in any supermarket contain corn in one form or another.  It steps back from corn and looks at the larger picture of mass production of food.  Parts of this process are chilling--mass slaughter of cattle, for instance. He notes the process by which Chicken McNuggets come about. Part II examines alternatives to industrial farming (as exemplified by the first section of the book), for instance, farms with an emphasis on grass. Here, a meal is compiled from items from such a source.<br /><br />In some ways, though, it is Part III that is especially fascinating.  Here, the author procures the ingredients for a dinner, which he then largely prepares himself (with some help from a friend!). This includes harvesting a wild pig, gathering mushrooms, capturing bacteria from the air to use to create homemade bread, using produce from his own garden. . . . And so on. The glitches that he encountered are enjoyable to read about (e.g., his failure to collect natural salt).<br /><br />The book is very readable and makes many good points. But, in the end, perhaps the best thing about this book is that it makes us reflect on how food is produced and what goes into what we eat. And it pushes us to ask if there are certain ways that might be better than others. Thought provoking. . . .better than others. Thought provoking. . . .
B000088E77|5.0|Australian new wave rockers Men At Work's debut album entitled Business as Usual was released in April of 1982 here in the US and late in 1981 in the band's native Australia.<br />The title for Men At Work's debut album said it all: Business as Usual(good straight rock songs with a reggae influence). This album is indeed a classic.<br />The band (which consisted of Scottish born guitarist/singer/songwriter Colin Hay plus Australians John Rees on bass guitar, Greg Ham on saxophones/flute/keyboards, Ron Strykert on lead guitar and Jerry Speiser on drums) got signed to Columbia Records first in Australia because of the song \\"Who Can it Be Now\\". After the song did well in Australia, America's branch of Columbia/CBS signed the group and released this debut in the spring of 1982. How is this album, read ahead and find out (as I did at age 6 when I kept heisting my sister's LP copy and then subsequently got the cassette in March of 1983 and now the remastered CD).<br />The opening \\"Who Can it Be Now\\" kicks off the album and was the song that gave Men at Work its first US Top 10 hit and is a great rocker. Next is \\"I Can See It In Your Eyes\\" and is a great rocker with some tasty solos from Strykert. Next is the chart topping \\"Down Under\\" and is a great number and a classic flute solo from Ham and popularized the term vegamite in the US which was unknown outside Australia prior to 1982. Next is the rocker \\"Underground\\" which is a great rocker. The first half ends with Greg Ham's vocal debut \\"Helpless Automaton\\" which is about a robot helplessly in love.<br />The second half begins with the Strykert penned rocker \\"People Just Love to Play With Words\\" which is a great song. Next is Business As Usual's third and final single \\"Be Good Johnny\\" which is a superb rocker. We slow down a bit with the mid tempo \\"Touching the Untouchables\\" which is a great song. We follow with the reggae-ish sounding rocker \\"Catch a Star\\" which would have not sounded out of place on The Police's first three albums. We end with the classic epic \\"Down By the Sea\\" which is, hands down, my favorite track on the album.<br />This album turned out to be a huge success and was #1 on the US album charts for an astounding 15 weeks in late 1982 and early 1983 (only to be KO'd by Michael Jackson's massive seller Thriller).<br />I really didn't like new wave much (save The Police and The Cars and some Talking Heads) but Men at Work was one band from childhood I did not ever really outgrow because their songs were catchy and quirky and are still good to listen to 25 plus years on.<br />The album was re-released with remastered sound in 2003 with FIVE BONUS TRACKS including three live versions and two B-sides.<br />Recommended!We end with the classic epic \\"Down By the Sea\\" which is, hands down, my favorite track on the album.

0440244870|4.0|The main character, Sophie Kinse-- I mean Becky Bloomwood, is so blooming ridiculous, you will likely find it humorous unless you are too extremely put off by the immature and naive behavior. Kinsella puts together a verbal slapstick comedy, where the punchline is not physical violence but feminine vapidity.<br /><br />The point is not to have sophisticated supporting characters or profound prose-- or a realistic plot, but just an escape and a jolly good time with a character that young women can apparently both identify with and look down on at the same time.
0792839730|4.0|The Bottom Line:    An impressive and technically-proficient retelling of Operation Market Garden with a star-studded cast and some enthralling battle scenes, A Bridge Too Far is a must for fans of war films or World War II in general.
B000X5SPBI|4.0|I found the first season to be cool and fun but it never totally scared me or creeped me out. The 2nd, 3rd and 4th season however have had some scary, creepy, brutally violent and disturbing episodes though. No matter how many times I see someones neck snap on the show it still makes me squirm. Season 3 I think has some of the more memorable episodes. There's nothing more messed up and disturbing than the Christmas episode. While the episode where Dean thinks a young boy of an ex is his son, is one of the funnier episodes despite some creepy scenes. I love when the kid says \\"AC/DC rules!.\\"<br /><br />  It's also one of the more engaging seasons, as Sam races against time to find a way to get Dean out of the deal he made with a demon. Dean has one year to live according to the deal. While a hot blond demon says she can help Sam save Dean. The first season never really felt like I was watching a scary horror movie every week, but the seasons that followed have more than a few episodes that have made me feel that way.
0792162803|2.0|What do you get when you take a 3 minute SNL skit and make a full length feature film out of it? Answer - SUPERSTAR! I really don't want to come down too hard on this goofy, but harmless film, because it does have it's moments. Molly Shannon and Co. do what they can with this mildly disturbing comedy with a predictable story. I rate it 2 stars in a good way!?....if that makes any sense.
1847246761|4.0|I listened to the unabridged audio book and found this light-weight thriller quite enjoyable. It kept its European flavor and it was obvious that this was home territory for the author. Simon Vance did a great job bringing the characters to life and made dealing with the Swedish names and locales no chore at all. The main characters had depth and developed throughout the book. The villains were somewhat clich&eacute;d and the resolution to the main plotline was telegraphed, at least to me, about midway through the book. There were unresolved threads that I look forward to seeing resolved in one of the two sequels.  It was enjoyable. Sometimes that is enough.
B0000AUHPG|3.0|The Bottom Line:    Yeah it's awesome seeing Henry Fonda as a bad guy, and Charles Bronson can stare menacingly with the best of them, but the movie lacks the raw urgency of Leone's Dollar trilogy or the underrated Duck You Sucker; it's worth seeing if you like Leone but it feels really long and often turgid.
B001L5SXQG|5.0|Ignore the cynical nostalgia buffs. This album is brilliant., January 31, 2009   By  Jason C. Brayshaw (Melbourne, Victoria, Australia) - See all my reviews                              Working on a Dream is not a flat out, Jersey bar rocker. Nor is it Nebraska or Ghost of Tom Joad Part II. And it is not an album about small town hoodlums drinking beer on the New Jersey shore. Instead this is an album of sweeping and majestic songs about love, hope, faith, and mercy - and the belief in staying positive against the changing times that affect us all. That said, the album's lyrical themes are perhaps more in line with the Beach Boys 'Pet Sounds' album than any other Springsteen album in the past.   Yes, the same characters that we've come to know and become familier with, from albums like Born in the USA, Tunnel of Love etc, surface again here on this album. Sure, the restlessness of Springsteen's characters are still expressed here, but rather this album is about the acceptence of the passing of time - when it moves too fast or grinds down so slow that it drives you spare. But it's not all malencholia either. Despite the bittersweetness of the album's melodies and arrangements, there is a sense of celebration here and a feeling of gratitude toward all that one has good in their life - however small.   I can understand the sentiment many had regarding the mix and sonic layout of Magic. A great album, yes, but at times the mix was very murky indeed. However, there is nothing to worry about here. The production and mix is so gorgeous and clear.   Key tracks: Working on a Dream (the opening bars are so Brian Wilson, it's stunning), My Lucky Day (vintage Bruce; this one), This Life (another breath taking Brian style intro), and Kingdom of Days (this song alone is what this album is all about: taking stock in yourself, and being true to your friends and loved ones).   So, if you're one of those Bruce fans who still thinks he lost it after 1975 you probably won't like this album, which I think is pretty sad. Is it his best album? Perhaps not. But then again which Springsteen album is? Sit down, don't talk, and play this album again. Listen . . . listen.
B001PPLIEQ|5.0|\\"Quantum\\" IS ONE OF THE BEST Bond movies ever made. Simply because it explores the character on a much deeper level than other Bond films. We see a Bond nearly destroy himself due to blind rage & intentions of revenge. THAT is the focus of the film & that makes it all the more powerful and compelling. It doesn't need gadgets, gimmicks, one liners or any of the previous Bond cliches. It just IS a great movie, all on its own. Anyone who doesn't see that knows nothing about movies or is simply too stupid to comprehend acting & directing.
6305161879|5.0|The Bottom Line:    A hilarious comedy which features a number of excellent comic turns (Kevin Kline was rightly rewarded with an Oscar), A Fish Called Wanda gets funnier upon multiple viewings and also--importantly--develops characters that we actually care a little about; all things considered, it's a supremely enjoyable film.

B001GZ6QEC|3.0|I was pretty excited to get this dvd considering all the hype about how great the movie is, however, I was pretty disappointed after watching it!  This movie is okay but it is not the \\"oscar-worthy\\" movie that people like to say it is.  Like I said in the title...it's just okay. The three stars are for the quality of the blu-ray, not the movie itself.
B000F7CMRM|3.0|The Bottom Line:    Syriana seems to be one of those movies you simply have to watch more than once, for upon viewing it I was confused about several of the storylines and characters; it feels a bit harsh to give the movie a negative recommendation on the basis of it being so convoluted, but remember that Traffic was similarly constructed yet one attentive viewing of it could lead to comprehension.
B0011V7P0A|5.0|Sales of this album were up 196% after he played at the Super Bowl.<br />It's a classic! Read the story of the band and then listen to the album.<br />Great product!!!
6304696515|4.0|The Bottom Line:    Far better than Cruel Intentions, the recent remake, Dangerous Liaisons is a biting costume drama that portrays pre-revolutionary France as just about the most decadent place on earth; with good performances by the always-reliable Malkovich and a suprisingly villainous Glenn Close, it's an effective film.
B00000729S|5.0|Where to begin. Punk can be traced to the original scream of gospel -- check out Archie Brownlee -- and through the holy tornado of John Coltrane's early-60s howling saxophone, and from there into the brains of a whole bunch of outcasts who were beginning to get really pissed with the rapid corporatization of the industrial world. But only one of these bands consisted of American soldiers stationed in Germany who were spewing blistering rock at THEIR FELLOW TROOPS. That would be the Monks. They shaved little circles in their hair, dressed in black robes, and wore nooses around their necks. There was trouble. The troops didn't like the sounds, and the Monks didn't like the troops. It was violent, raging, and completely real. The Monks featured a monster rhythm section, a howling amplified banjo, precise organ whacking and a fuzzed-out lead singer. This was about 1963, the age of Skiffle music and Peter, Paul and Mary, and there would be nothing like this until several years later when the Velvets, The Who and the Pretty Things caught on and invented simple, devastating pop music. Now, this as not an argument as to \\"who came first\\", but a heads-up to one of the finest and most ground-breaking bands you've never heard of. Their one and only album, with its stark black cover that proceeded the Velvets second album by five years, is my idea of a masterpiece -- completely original and real, presented without concern, and perhaps with disdain, for commercial success. Recommended to the death. Hey Juff, how's it going?
B00000G3I2|3.0|The Bottom Line:    The fact that The Big Chill takes itself seriously doesn't mean you should: this is a slow-moving drama about college buddies reuniting after one of them dies which features the requisite drama and tears but never manages to be terribly interesting.
B000007U6V|5.0|I remember listening to Autobahn on WGTB-FM in Washington, D.C. in 1972. WOW!! This was a must have. So off I went to Kemp Mill Records and then to the \\"Import\\" section. For over 35 years this has been one of the best driving tunes to listen to. Now on CD, this is a great buy.
B000Q6GX5Y|3.0|The Bottom Line:    300 totally works while you're watching it but seems silly after it's over: the scene where ***spoiler*** Theron dies is laughable (\\"Treason! Treason!\\"), Xerxes seems to be a pre-historical drag queen, and no one can say anything without shouting; it's definitely worth watching if you like action or war films, but it's also not that good.
B001G9LVGG|3.0|I have all LM's albums. This new release is nice, easy and relaxing; unfortunately it does not compare to her album called \\"An Ancient Muse\\".<br />If you are new to LM, try instead \\"An Ancient Muse\\". This one is her masterpiece.
B00002E224|5.0|The Bottom Line:    One of the best romantic movies ever made, Before Sunrise is brilliant in its simplicity: it has no comic pratfalls, no third act breakup, no sight gags, and no misunderstandings between the couple, just 100 minutes of two very interesting characters walking through a city and falling in love.
B001KL3GY0|4.0|I have been a fan of Franz from the beginning, but I admit that the last album wasn't their strongest. With this new release, I have come to appreciate the band once again. Initially I wasn't a fan of the single \\"Ulysses,\\" but in context with the rest of the album I have come to quite enjoy it.    \\"No You Girls\\" is another highlight, fun and dancey. It is made even better by the fact that the perfect ballad \\"Katherine Kiss Me\\" is its complement. Seriously, \\"Katherine Kiss Me\\" is the ballad that always should have been from Franz (I was not a big fan of the attempts on the last album, \\"Eleanor Put Your Boots On\\" and \\"Fade Together\\").     \\"Can't Stop Feeling\\" is one of my favorites, but like on other songs there is just one little thing that I'm not fully convinced was the best choice (in this song, it's the use of some very heavy/dark sounding synth that doesn't really tie in with the rest of the song). Still, the lyrics on this are some of the best on the album.     The album version of \\"Lucid Dreams\\" just blows the single/demo version out of the water. It weaves in and out of different sounds seamlessly, is catchy in the beginning, and becomes a synthy dream in itself (though I admit it could have been just as good without the extended instrumental ending). Again, this song has a great complement in \\"Dream Again\\". This song isn't the strongest on its own, but by following \\"Lucid Dreams\\" it maintains the story-telling concept (like waking up from that dream).    Overall, I tend to enjoy the first few and last few songs the best on this album, but the rest are still enjoyable. I like the fact that Franz went in a new direction, a little darker while still maintaining the catchiness fans have always liked.
B0002YLC24|5.0|The Bottom Line:    Before Sunset does what sequels should do but often don't: it stays true to the nature of the original while also taking the story to a new place; sadder and more pessimistic than the original, Sunset skillfully and emotionally continues the story of Jesse and Celine and ends just about perfectly.
B001GM28HO|3.0|Majority of Lady Gaga's tracks are danceable, catchy, and full of energy and stamina; however, several songs fail to make my playlist. I've blocked them out of my mind as I can't recall them.  One of the bonus tracks, \\"Summerboy\\", is reminiscent of the sounds of \\"No Doubt\\" (Gwen Stefani).  That was a throwback but again it's in the groove of grooves.  I love \\"Just Dance,\\" and \\"Poker Face\\" is adorable as well as \\"Paper Gangsta (\\"M.I.A.\\"-ish without the gunshots).  If you want high-energy electric pop...dance music that will keep you above ground, then Lady Gaga's \\"The Fame\\" is the CD for this moment.  Her presence is electrifying and I can't wait to purchase more music from this artist.
B00005JPAO|4.0|The Bottom Line:    An interesting drama that doesn't follow a biopic formula and is all the better for it, The Queen shows the events surrounding Princess Diana's 1997 death through the eyes of Queen Elizabeth II; with fine performances by Mirren, Sheen, and Cromwell, it's a successful and interesting piece of filmmaking.
B001HN697C|4.0|Hundreds of years before the first \\"Underworld\\" movie, werewolves were slaves to the vampires, led by Viktor (Nighy).  The werewolf Lucian (Sheen) is the favored slave of Viktor.  They maintain a respectable relationship despite their differences.  Unbeknownst to Viktor, Lucian and Viktor's daughter Sonja (Mitra) are in love.  They sneak off to be together even though relationships between vampires and warewolves  is forbidden.  Their relationship prompts Lucien to remove his collar and go after when she is in danger.  Despite saving her, Lucien is punished like the rest of the warewolves.  This plants the seeds for their uprising.<br /><br />\\"Underworld: Rise of the Lycans\\" is a movie that probably does not need to be made.  The story was laid out quickly in the first \\"Underworld\\" movie.  That being said, \\"Rise of the Lycans\\" is surprisingly entertaining.  Nighy and Sheen are doing the overacting that fans of the series have come to love.  There are plenty of actions scenes.  And, this time, the film is a bit of a period piece.  Shakespeare this ain't, but I do not think that fans of the series will be disappointed.
B00151A6TI|1.0|I'm sorry...so very sorry. I am NOT a Zappa fan. Never have been, never will be. With all the \\"sub-genres\\" out there today, let's label this \\"humor rock\\". I don't like it, I cannot listen to it. Ten minutes into this disc it went flying like a frisbee out my car window. No kidding. I even tried to mentally block out the vocals/lyrics to see if I could listen to the instrumental portion of it and I still couldn't hear any redeeming qualities. I know there's an audience for this kind of stuff out there and I apologize for for my lack of objectivity in advance. Hey, it missed the dumpster...maybe someone will find it and enjoy it. Am I biased? Darn right I'm biased. The cherry on top of the sundae was when I looked at my 11-year old son's expression on his face while we were listening. He plays first cello in the local youth orchestra and loves \\"Guitar Hero\\". He didn't have to say a word, the look was pain. Raising deflector shields...INCOMING!
B001P9KR8U|5.0|Jamal Malik (Patel) is a \\"slumdog\\" - a poor boy - from the streets of Mumbai.  And yet, when he ends up on the Indian version of \\"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\\", he answers enough questions correctly to get to the final round.  He wins 10 million rupees before time runs out for the episode.  He will need to come back the next day for the final question, but as he is leaving the studio, the police take him in for questioning.  They are sure that he has cheated, given his roots.  After a torture session, he begins to recount how he has come to know the answers to the questions.  This involves a flashback tour of his life that includes two other significant players: his brother Salim (Mittal) and the girl he loves, Latika (Pinto).<br /><br />\\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" is a well told story of a boy's attempt to make it from the slums of India and find the girl of his dreams.  Despite its early gloominess, it is surprisingly uplifting.  Crossing genres, this film is a romance, mystery, and thriller all at once.  The framing of the story around the questions of the game show adds to its uniqueness.  The actors, while not grizzled veterans, embody their characters and are thoroughly likeable.  \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" is very much worth checking out.  It is the Oscar favorite for best picture, and I would not be surprised if it walks away with the trophy.
B000FA57RG|3.0|I'm Going to Tell You a Secret being Madonna's 2006 release and her first live album is ok and shows what I always believed that Madonna is a better studio artist then a live act. The first track is a strange spoken word tune and the rest sounds good but not nearly as good as the studio versions. Here we get tracks such as Vogue, Like a Prayer and Holiday. The booklet looks like a failed highschool project with pictures that look like the person needs to take another course with photoshop. 3/5.
B001KVZ6FC|5.0|Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) is a grumpy old man whose wife has just died.  He now lives with only his dog, and barely speaks with his family.  The neighborhood where he lives is changing.  There are more gangs and the population is becoming more diverse - two things which don't please Walt at all.  He doesn't get along well with the Asian family next door, and when the son, Thao (Vang) tries to steal his 1972 Gran Torino, things get even cooler.  But, after saving Thao from a gang, things change.  Soon Thao is working for Walt doing chores, and his sister Sue (Her) is hanging out with Walt.  The family is grateful for what Walt has done, but the gang is still out there, and they are not so easily dissuaded.<br /><br />\\"Gran Torino\\" is a great showcase for Clint Eastwood.  He makes the movie, and is the reason to see it.  The grumpy, irritable Walt is a real piece of work, and his transformation is effective and believable.  The supporting cast does a good job, but they are far outshined by Eastwood.  The story is interesting and believable, and does not have a cheap (or cop-out) ending.  Supposedly this is Eastwood's last acting role.  If that is the case, get out there and see \\"gran Torino.\\"  You will not be disappointed.
B001L5SXQG|5.0|Working on a Dream is an album that cannot be completely savored and absorbed within one listen. The sound of this album is epic in its production and the mix is pretty close to perfect. (unlike the equally great Magic that preceded Working). Anyone expecting the same Springsteen that rocked through the 70's and mid 80's will be disappointed. Bruce is an artist that can always be trusted to evolve and he has never let us down in that respect. From the sprawling opening of Outlaw Pete to the beautiful and quaint closing with The Wrestler, the songs featured in this album vary in style and sound. While the song My Lucky Day is the closest to traditional Bruce that you'll get on this album, that doesn't mean that everything else lacks in quality. Queen of the Supermarket is a beautiful song that captures the feel of sudden love, a theme that runs throughout the album. What Love can Do is a catchy song that will have you bobbing your head and tapping your feet. Life Itself is another amazing addition to the album that has incredible lyrics. Tomorrow Never Knows is a brief but rich song that has its roots in folk (the inspiration from Pete Seeger is evident in this one). The title track is a nice \\"Springsteenian\\" pop song that will surely bring a good mood. Surprise, Surprise is the most pop sounding song on the album (and in my opinion the weakest, but at the same time not a bad song by any means). The Last Carnival is an incredible song that captures the image of the carnival taking downs its tents for the last time. Good Eye is a quick little track that is all blues (much like Bruce's Halloween track Night with the Jersey Devil). This Life is another good addition to the album, but will most likely not be the first song you think of when Working on a Dream (album) comes to mind. Overall this is a solid album from Springsteen. While the sound is different, it is perfectly capable of being compared with any of Bruce's classic albums. As long as you don't pop in the discexpecting to hear tracks that could be found on Born to Run or Darkness of the Edge of Town than you are surely going to enjoy this new album thoroughly. Bruce Springsteen is an unstoppable force in the world of music, and he proves his everlasting talent on this whirlwind of a great album.
B000P0J02E|5.0|I wont be lengthy or verbose. If you enjoy movie soundtracks, you will enjoy the range of emotions this soundtrack plays to.  It is just FUN to listen to!
B000FS9MV0|5.0|I shake my head and ask how can this young woman sing like that! All the tracks on the album are wonderful! Three stand outs are:  \\"Lover Man\\" is a musical roller coaster showing Renee's great range going from light soaring highs to gut hitting lows and everything in between.  \\"Stars Fell On Alabama\\" is a sweet dream of years gone past.  \\"My Baby Just Cares For Me\\" is fun and sassy. Renee \\"sure does\\" sing it great!  Than Renee \\"Stone Country's\\" (Please re-release this album!) us with three songs she co-wrote with David Foster with a country flavor:  \\"Hold Me Now, Midnight In Austin Texas (very bold, bluesy and flirty) and Nothing But The Blame\\" are great songs. NBTB really soars , you feel the emotion from this amazing young singer. Renee was 14 when she recorded her much loved self-titled CD released in 04; she was probably 16 or 17 when most of this album was recorded. So young, so talented.

B000X5SPBI|5.0|What can anyone say, all of Season 3 in an awesome package. The digital copy of the episodes rocks, I only wish you could get the special features too, but I'll live.
B001GSV3EC|5.0|People are always debating who is the best guitarist... there truly is no right answer as it's a subjective argument.  But Jeff Beck should be near the top of everyone's list - he is truly an original on guitar and his playing is masterful.  He gets many unique sounds out of his instrument and really makes it sing.  If you enjoy great guitar playing then buy this cd.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|It's amazing what you miss the first time through! Love having all episodes and the outtakes at my finger tips. Now I can really zoom in and figure out when they were filming in my hometown!
B001MW0J2O|5.0|It's just brilliant.  It may only be February, but unless this turns out to be an unbelievably tremendous year in the music world, Merriweather Post Pavilion will undoubtedly be one of the finest albums of the year (possibly of the decade).  I can't think of an \\"experimental\\" album that is as approachable and as discordantly beautiful.  The blast of sound at the center of \\"In The Flowers\\" should be completely abrasive, but it's at once exhilarating and hauntingly beautiful.  And then \\"My Girls.\\"  What a song.  No band around today (few bands in history) have managed to make so much out of so little.    This is the peak of Animal Collective's career to date.  If you've never heard 'em, if you're unsure about this kind of music, just let it happen.  Just put it on, and let it play.  It's that great.
B0015I2P0Y|5.0|Saw this band on \\"Live from Abbey Road\\" on Sundance Channel, loved the song \\"The Bones of You\\" so much I made it my ring tone, then bought the CD.  Loved the CD so much, I bought 3 more copies for friend who just had to have it, too.  \\"One Day Like This\\" is a beautiful and romantic powerful piece.  Their lyrics are consistently fresh in expressing ageless ideas of love and friendship.  Vocals so engaging, every musician at the top of his game. I know this isn't their first CD, but it's hard to imagine that they're just going to keep getting better than this.
0812550706|1.0|Years ago, when I read this, I wrote a very, very lengthy review and posted it here on Amazon.  It was never put up, because the Amazon moderators didn't approve; it was too mean, they said.<br /><br />That killed my desire to write a review for this and for books in general, although I'm trying to do so now that it's a few years later.<br /><br />I'm not going to bother writing up a lengthy review again, just for Amazon to throw it in the trash.  I'm just going to say this book came across as very, very juvenile and hilariously absurd.  One of the highlights is ***spoiler*** Ender's brother and sister changing the world via the internet.  I guess Card didn't predict how every argument on the internet ends with people calling each other trolls.<br /><br />Regardless, while I'm not going to make another lengthy review, it does bother me that such a bad book can get such good ratings by others.  Thus, I'm trying to temper the enthusiasm with my honest rating.
B00000K0DQ|4.0|It's easy to kill a monster, but it's hard to kill a human being.'<br /><br />Set in St. Thomas Housing Project and Angola Prison in New Orleans, \\"Dead Man Walking\\" is the true story of Helen Prejean (Susan Sarandon), a Louisiana nun Sister who befriended Matthew Poncelet (Sean Penn), a murderer and a rapist bound for a lethal injection machine for killing a teenage couple... Sister Helen agrees to help the convict and to remain with him till the end--an act never before attempted by a woman...<br /><br />At their first meeting, Poncelet swears to the nun that his accomplice was the one who shot both of the kids and pleads her help for a new trial in order to convince the pardon board hearing to spare his life...<br /><br />The film challenges the audience to actually give some thought to the human consequences of the death penalty, but gives voice to angry bereaved parents whose kids were shot, stabbed, raped, and left in the woods to die alone...<br /><br />As Poncelet's execution looms closer and closer, his character is seen deceptively complex, harboring doubts about the rightness of what they were doing to him... In one moment, we hear him sensitive asking for a lie detector test to let his mother know that he is innocent, in another we see him furious playing the victim, blaming the government, drugs, blacks, the kids for being there... Poncelet never understood that he has robbed the Percys and the Delacroixs so much, giving them nothing but sorrow... They are never going to see their children again, never going to hold them, to love them, to laugh with them...<br /><br />In the scenes leading up to his execution, the death-row inmate drops his terrible facade and reveals his identity... Luckily both Sarandon and Penn are here exceptional--carrying out successfully an exquisite, tangible harmony of souls... When Sarandon was looking at Penn, she was projecting compassionate eyes brimming with tears... She asks him to visualize her as he dies-- ''I want the last thing you see in this world to be the face of love''--in that moment, we truly believed that she'll be the face of love for him...e the face of love''--in that moment, we truly believed that she'll be the face of love for him...

B001G5ZKZS|5.0|This is an amazing DVD. I really feel like I am standing on stage when I watch this. The sound is better than the studio CD and the guys are in top form these days, for sure. Geddy is singing better than ever and writing really good vocal lines. The S&A songs are very well written and live they take on a whole new life.      I was on the 4th row in Alpharetta GA on the second leg of the tour (July 22nd, 2008) and that show was the best I'd ever seen, and thankfully also recorded in HD for the bonus disk.     My favorite songs are the drum solo, of course, The Way the Wind Blows, Spindrift, and especially Armor and Sword - a perfect blend of 70's and early 80's Rush. These songs resonate emotionally and visually.     I can't wait to get the Blu-Ray version.     A must own!

B0001AVZA8|5.0|Let me start by saying that I am a 37 year old male that generally doesn't watch these types of movies. Okay, here goes...    I just watched this film, and perhaps it caught me at the right moment because it made me cry... twice. There are many reviews out there, so I won't waste your time repeating the good things (I have no bad thoughts about this film, so I won't go there either).    I didn't think this film was anything special when I began to watch it (well, it is a chick flick). Then the relationship between Harry and Erica began to develop and I was being drawn in. Before I knew it I had a tear running down my cheek. Sometimes movies, like people, just click with you. It was unexpected and fun. A message I think the movie tries to portray; that sometimes the best moments in life are unexpected.    One negative reviewer said, \\"Erica makes a strange decision to choose a man who has been a jerk to her over one who has treated her with total kindness. What woman in her right mind would dump a gorgeous doctor who is madly in love with her (and with whom she has great chemistry) for an insensitive playboy who has broken her heart?\\"    If you think along these same lines, don't bother watching this film. If you are the type of person that is willing to let your emotions take you for a fun ride, give it a try. Love is never logical. That is why it is such a beautiful thing. Enjoy!
B0017R5UAA|4.0|I've never heard a band in the rock genre sound so much like a choir, and if I read that observation from someone else, I would immediately dismiss these guys.  But wait:  they make it work.  The arrangements, while folky, are often surprising and always effective.  Their approach comes together best on \\"He Doesn't Know Why,\\" a plaintive lament about a lost brother returned, which is full of sadness and anger and yet builds beautifully.   With their unassuming approach to making music, these guys sound like they came out of some mountain village lost in time.  Pastoral and memorable.

1416585710|5.0|I think this story is wonderful!!! Its definately a step away from King's usual. However all the elements are there! The scare and geez what if and suspense. My favorite element was the foremost aspect of the novel....The love story. I wish king would consider writing another!! The only negative thing I have to say is that at certain points the story did seem to lag a bit, with the inner monalogue dragging on a tad to long. Overall I love it and have read it three times!!!!

038073186X|2.0|Lehane is a masterful storyteller and most of his previous books I rated as five star thrillers. But books about psychology is just not my kind of story, so it was boring and never captured my attention. The last fifty pages were the best part of the book, so at least it had a great ending.<br /><br />Oh, the book was about two US Marshals investigating the strange disappearance of a violent inmate. Once they got on this isolated island that housed an institution for the criminally insane, nothing was as it should be.
8423671267|5.0|Todo sucedio en el verano de 1937, una viuda, Simone, y sus dos hijos, Irene y Dorian Sauvelle, se mudan desde París hacia un pueblecito en la costa, huyendo de las numerosas deudas que la muerte de Armand Sauvelle ha dejado tras de sí.    Siguiendo la promesa de un buen empleo como ama de llaves de un adinerado y misterioso inventor de juguetes llamado Lazarus Jann, los Sauvelle parten hacia la costa de Normandía.    Lazarus, el misterioso fabricante de juguetes, vive recluido en una gigantesca mansión llamada Cravenmoore, con la única companía de su esposa Alexandra gravemente enferma y postrada en cama desde hace más de veinte años, y cientos de seres mecánicos, extraños juguetes y autómatas.    Poco después de llegar, Irene conoce a Hannah, una vivaracha chica que también trabaja en Cravenmoore y a Ismael, primo de ésta, un joven tímido y amante del mar, por quien se siente atraída. Dorian por su parte se dedica a explorar los alrededores y a descubrir los misterios de los juguetes mecánicos que se alojan en la mansión, mientras tanto Simone traba amistad con Lazarus, a la vez que aprende las pequeñas extravagancias del inventor.    Cuando los Sauvelle sienten que al fin sus vidas estan tomando un respiro de todas las tragedias que atras dejaron... Empieza la accion!    Como es muy usual del autor, esta uno con la guardia baja y de un renglon a otro la historia da mas de 2 vueltas. Te queda buen sabor de boca, y la duda de...    Para cuando el otro?
B000MNP2KI|4.0|Slick production.  Lavish surroundings.  Terse banter.  Striking hero and villain.  Ultrahigh stakes competition.  This is the most entertaining Bond film since \\"You Only Live Twice\\".  It recalls the witticism of \\"Goldfinger\\",  the tough, pragmatic Bond of \\"The Living Daylights\\" and  the shrewd M (Judi Dench) of \\"Goldeneye\\".   This Bond is worth of look.
B0016HNOXQ|5.0|I honestly got tired and annoyed of waiting for this album. Portishead being one of my muses I was getting ready to write them off. The first track I heard off this album was Machine Gun - I didn't like, I felt frustrated by it. Then I woke up one day and listened to it again and it finally sunk in. I pre-ordered the vinyl. When it showed up I put it on and just finally enjoyed  the return of a set of true modern composers.<br /><br />What makes Portishead such genius is that they are truly composers. They don't just follow the tradition of a four part band. They truly experiment with vocal and instrumentation to form a true composition. Just like classic composers they just use what they are interested in at the time. The scratching and the theremin of the second album are gone, because that's done. It's time to move on.<br /><br />Instead the have a beautiful use of what I can only describe as analogue, digital. Rather than just using loops Geoff applies programed samples to his set and plays them in real time. This combination of human driven sampling is really what gives portishead their edge. Its also why they are so unbelievable live, they don't try to recreate computerized samples live because that's not how they were produced in the studio.<br /><br />Drop the needle, kill the lights, lie back and enjoy the best trip hop you can get.
B001KVZ6FC|5.0|Gran Torino is a compelling script performed by an excellent ensemble cast. Eastwood's gift for directing, and portraying the dialogue and interplay between characters gives this work real depth and intimacy. The cinematography and lighting are skillfully effected to wrap the viewer in the feeling of despair and dilapidation that surround the characters, their neighborhood and their relationships. All elements combine for an outstanding film that takes the viewer on a tour of his own soul. What we find is what these characters find. No matter our age, race or culture, we're all looking for the same thing.
B00003CX8U|5.0|Frenetic, dazzling fever dream, All That jazz is a sensory feast.<br /><br />Likened to Fellini's 8 1/2, due to its autobiographical nature, the film depicts a harried period in Fosse's life.  He was cutting the film \\"Lenny,\\" at the same time he was directing the musical \\"Chicago\\" on Broadway, while suffering from exhaustion.<br /><br />The scenes which intercut between his open-heart surgery and dance- fantasy sequence are some of the most dazzling of his career.<br /><br />The back story shows him working in a strip club as a boy, foreshadowing his reckless, philandering behavior careening into drug abuse, sexual compulsion and no-holds-barred excess.<br /><br />One especially incisive sequence depicts the producers of \\"Chicago\\" cold-heartedly discussing the positive financial ramifications of the director's death should he fail to make it through his heart surgery.<br /><br />Fosse's tour de force, All That Jazz was one of the top films of the late 70's.  Unfortunately, it was one of his last as he died a few short years after this masterpiece.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Well ladies and gentlemen, one of the most sought after BluRay's has arrived.<br /><br />\\"The Dark Knight\\"<br /><br />This movie blew my socks off the first, the second, the third, and fourth time I watched it.

0071410945|5.0|This is a handy little book.  And I do mean 'little'.  Weighing in at under 50 pages, they saved some forests with this one.<br /><br />It can be digested in one sitting, actually in one cup of coffee (or green tea, etc.)  But with our attention-fractured society, maybe that's a good thing.<br /><br />What's most important, though, is that the author completely laid out his technique in the allotted space.  And it works.<br /><br />I'm a writer who has never been saddled with writer's block (hang on, just need some wood to knock on - OK), but it turns out I've been inherently using this technique for a long time.<br /><br />In fact, some of what Mr. Young describes is an encapsulated, Reader's Digest-version of the same things explained in Psycho-Cybernetics by Maxwell Maltz and The Power of Your Subconscious Mind by Joseph Murphy.<br /><br />If you'd like the complete manual on how to communicate with your subconscious in order to improve any aspect of your life, then definitely check out those deluxe models of this technique.<br /><br />In the meantime, if you simply want a quick blueprint which allows you to crank out ideas for your creative projects, this little gem will work wonders for you.
B0015DYIH2|1.0|After selling thousands of the various versions of the book, they raise the price from $9.99 to $12.  Greed - Greed - Greed.  Seems to be an epidemic in the corporate world now a days...  BTW, the book was ok - not as good as the first couple in the series.

B001JRB16U|5.0|I saw Mary Poppins when it was first released in 1964 and even after all these years, the movie never fails to enchant and entertain, boasting the academy-award winning debut of Julie Andrews as the practically perfect, nay, perfect Mary and Dick Van Dyke as Bert the jack-of-all-trades is also superb, even though his cockney accent comes and goes at whim.  His last occupation as a chimney sweep leads to \\"Chim Chim Cheree\\" as a march across the rooftops of London by he and Mary with the children Jane and Michael as tag-alongs seques into a platoon of sweeps singing and dancing \\"Step in Time\\"led by Bert in one of the longest dance sequences in the history of cinema.<br /><br />P.L. Travers the author of the original stories was somewhat dismayed(to say the least) at the Disneyfication of her somewhat somber and dark tales---but the lighter touch is much preferred over the somewhat dreary production. now trodding the boards on Broadway and London.<br /><br />The movie is brimming with many brilliant set-peices including the extended \\"Jolly Holiday\\" sequence which seamlessly blends cartoon characters with Mary, Bert and the children featuring the nonsense song \\"Supercali....etc\\".<br /><br />Another standout sequence is \\"Feed the Birds\\" the prettiest song in the score.<br /><br />Glynnis Johns as the dizzy Mrs Banks, \\"Sister Suffragate\\" is adorable and David Tomlinson as the appropriately stuffy Mr Banks who has a somewhat pedantic view on how to run a household,wife and children until Bert, not Mary shows him the error of his ways.<br /><br />To be sure Mary Poppins has its flaws.  Sometimes it tends to be precious(the children)and sweet(the children) but not sweet enough to bring cavities but all in all, Mary Poppins is still fresh and bright after 45 years and 45 years from now when most of us reading this will be memories, Mary Poppins will still be here to enchant and entertain. This review is dedicated to my friend Jason.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|quit whining about the sound. the reviews are supposed to be about the music itself. i've listened to the album numerous times, and the sound of it does not distract from the songs. most of the people like the songs, but seem to be affected by the sound. get over it. you're not technicians. i don't think people were bitching about the sound of buddy holly or elvis back in the day. shut the hell up...the songs are what matter, not the production. by the way, i like the album.
B001HN6972|5.0|\\"I've got a secret I've been hiding under my skin\\"<br />(Styx)<br /><br />Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):<br /><br />1. Young Michael Berg (David Kross) has an affair to remember with Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet)<br />2. They alternate between bed covers and book covers<br />3. It ends abruptly<br />4. Michael carries it in his heart for the rest of his life<br />5. As a young law student, he encounters her again under highly unusual circumstances<br />6. Her secret shame becomes her undoing<br /><br />The movie is told mostly through the recollections of the adult Michael (Ralph Fiennes).  Although the subject matter is dark, and Hanna's career choice disturbing, Winslet does both the simplicity and complexity of her character so well that you'll empathize with her, even while hating what she becomes through fate and circumstance.  This is a character that you should have no sympathy for, but don't be surprised if you find yourself surreptitiously wiping away a tear towards the end of the movie.<br /><br />An unforgettable story that will stay with you after the credits have rolled, and a magnificent performance by Winslet, surpassing even her award-winning performance in [[ASIN:B0016Q2D66 Revolutionary Road ]].<br /><br />Hanna Schmitz: \\"It doesn't matter what I think. It doesn't matter what I feel. The dead are still dead.\\"<br /><br />Amanda Richards, February 1, 2009
B000VSBX34|5.0|The Beatles' \\"HELP\\", is an underrated classic.It brought back a lot of great memories.

B001ACH4DS|5.0|This album is exactly what you'd expect from this particular American Idol winner. Rock anthems, ballads, and an album cover picture of Daughtry with hair. With writing credits on 11 of the 14 songs (there's a sneakily hidden track after song 12, twelve minutes in), Cook establishes himself as a singer/songwriter, and steps up from his Analog Heart days.  All he needs now is someone to create better album jackets.<br /><br />Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):<br /><br />1. Declaration: We hear you!<br />2. Heroes: Rockin' intro, monster rock ballad<br />3. Lights On: My son loves this track, and plays it at every opportunity. It's even on his cellphone as both the ringtone and the wake-up tune.<br />4. Come Back to Me: This completes the opening quartet of best tracks on the album.<br />5. Life on the Moon: Okay, make that a quintet<br />6. Mr. Sensitive: How emo can you go? Hard rocking chorus.<br />7. Lie: I like it, and that's the truth<br />8. Avalanche: the snowball's rolling<br />9. Permanent: Dude sings his heart out<br />10. The Time of My Life: The title-winning song<br /><br />A solid album, recommended for fans of arena rock, eye-liner embellished rockers and American Idol.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, January 31, 2009
B0017V7GTY|5.0|2008 was never a good year for music; one of my favorite bands, Rise Against, abandoned me and many other longtime fans with a radio pop album, The Offspring has processed out another mediocre record, and many other disappointments that I won't elaborate on. I can't turn on Steven's Untitled Rock Show and see a new band I could really get into, like I used to be able to. In fact, it's not only 2008; these times in general are hard on music listeners like me, who are just looking for something more than what we're fed in every high school across the nation.<br /><br />Well, Gaslight Anthem is the answer for all of us; they're one of the few bands that play form their hearts, and make sure you know they are. I personally can't find an album I can emotionally connect with more, from the lyrics to the sheer idea that they want to connect with you, like they wrote the album for you. I'm sure you won't find any other album like that in recent years.<br /><br />And plus, with only one mediocre song (Even Cowgirls Get the Blues), this album is musically exceptional.
B001GQACGO|4.0|Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):<br /><br />1. If I Were A Boy: First rate song, and gets better after you've watched the excellent video. Starts slowly and works its way into your heart.<br />2. Halo: Best song on the album. Passed up by Leona Lewis, who would also have done a pretty good job. Heart-pounding soaring chorus.<br />3. Ave Maria: Simple interpretation and beautifully sung version<br />4. Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It): Yes, even after all those parodies on youtube.<br />5. Diva: Didn't like this at first listen, and still don't care that much for the lyrics, but the track has grown on me.<br /><br />This is a 2 disc set, one disc of eight radio-friendly ballads, and one of eight R&B/Dance tracks. Other than the hits listed above, the first disc has \\"Disappear\\" which is a mainstream ballad, but didn't make the short list because she's a little shaky on the low notes.  \\"Broken-Hearted Girl\\" is a good ballad, but not an immediate stand-out, even though it's much, much better than the average filler material.  Nothing else is of the quality of (1.) (2.) or (3.) above.<br /><br />On disc two, \\"Radio\\" isn't a bad dance track, sounding a little disco Donna Summer-ish.  Same goes for \\"Sweet Dreams\\", a definite toe-tapper. \\"Video Phone\\" goes reggae and \\"Hello\\" is probably the weakest track on the album.  Didn't care for \\"Ego\\" or \\"Scared of Lonely\\" either, but they're not THAT bad.<br /><br />The most noticeable thing about this album is that Beyonce seems comfortable and confident with the songs, and you don't get the impression that she's straining or trying too hard.  If you don't like this album on the first listen, try, try again - especially the tracks in the SASS above.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, January 31, 2009
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Its a really good game that gets interesting each time you play. Its one of those board games that needs different strategies because of the various combinations it can be set to.
B001F290E4|4.0|After 2 brilliant (self-titled) albums in the early 1990s, Seal kinda dropped off the radar screen for me. I would take a listen to the later album, and wasn't really all that taken with them, and 2007's \\"System\\" album was the exclamation point of that. Not a single memorable moment on it. Now comes this all-cover album of soul classics, and my first reaction (before hearing the album) was that Seal was going the way of Rod Stewart and Barry Manilow with cheesy \\"standard\\" albums. Well color me surprised after hearing this collection.<br /><br />\\"Soul\\" (12 tracks, 45 min.) brings mostly well-known soul standards, but the great vocalist that he is, Seal brings them with great conviction, and the production standard of this album is nothing short of outstanding. The opener, Sam Cooke's \\"A Change Is Gonna Come\\" is unintentionally intended (or not) but of course you cannot think of that song and Obama's election victory as president just about this album came out. There are two outstanding Al Green covers: \\"Here I Am (Come and Take Me), putting the UB 40 cover to shame, and \\"I'm Still In Love With You\\". Other highlights for me are Otis Reading's \\"I've Been Loving You Too Long\\" and Curtis Reading's \\"People Get Ready\\".<br /><br />The only off-moment for me is \\"Stand By Me\\": no cover, how well intended, can grasp any further life from that song. That said, I was truly charmed by this album. It plays effortlessly from start to finish. That said, where will Seal go from here? If I see a \\"Soul 2\\" next year, I will cry out \\"Rod Stewart! Barry Manilow\\"!
B001KOFH2G|5.0|For the record, I have now owned two editions of FIREFLY and three editions of SERENITY.  And while I was not convinced that the tremendous increase of price for FIREFLY on Blu-ray justified the slight increase in visual quality, I am a huge fan of SERENITY on Blu-ray.  The price is reasonable and the increase in visual quality is significantly better than the original DVD.<br /><br />Most people know the story at this point.  FOX bizarrely and inexplicably (oh, well, unless you are talking about a possible minimal improvement in your bottom line -- though I would like to know what the viewership of the shows that took FIREFLY's place on the Friday night schedule was) cancelled FIREFLY, broadcasting only eleven episodes (though others were made, only to be seen when the DVD box set was released).  Then FIREFLY became one of the most successful shows on DVD in the history of the new medium.  Indeed, it and FAMILY GUY helped redefine the understanding of the relation between DVDs and cancelled series.  And their strong sales led both to the renewal of FAMILY GUY as a series and the revival of FIREFLY as a movie.<br /><br />By any measure, SERENITY was a disappointment as a feature release.  It failed to recoup production costs in domestic ticket sales and only by a whisker broke even in international sales.  But like FIREFLY, the film was a huge success on DVD.  After a couple of pressings of the original DVD (with one of the ugliest covers ever), Universal brought out a two-disc Collector's edition, which also did well in DVD sales.  Now both FIREFLY and SERENITY have appeared in Blu-ray.  As Mr. Universe would say, you can't stop the signal.  While SERENITY did not at first make money for Universal, it has over time turned the studio quite a profit.  This success has led to speculation from time to time that Universal might push for another film, either as a theater release or as a direct-to-DVD (a TV movie would seem to be precluded by the terms of Universal's agreement with 20th Century Fox, which owns the TV rights to the series).  And fans have a right to continue to hope.  Joss Whedon had long kept two major FIREFLY/SERENITY secrets secret.  One had to do with Shepherd Book's background and the other with Inara's back-story.  Book's story will be revealed shortly in the next SERENITY comic series \\"A Shepherd's Tale,\\" which will indeed delve into the secret of his past, of what he was before he entered the monastery.  But Whedon has persistently refused to divulge Inara's story and has forbidden Monica Baccarin to reveal it.  He has also stated that if there is ever a SERENITY sequel, Mal and Inara's relationship will feature much more prominently, and presumably whatever it is that she is hiding.<br /><br />Anyone who saw FIREFLY knew that while River was not at the time one of the crucial characters on the show, that her story was nonetheless going to be the central catalyst for the show's plot.  At the time we knew that agents of the Blue Sun Corporation (which receives no mention in the film, but which was the corporate entity that undertook the experiments on River) were anxious to find River.  The show's plot was clearly going to revolve around her secret, why the government and Blue Sun wanted her back, and precisely what they had turned her into.  We got hints on the show.  We knew she was psychic.  We knew that she possessed some bizarre abilities (such as shooting three men at a distance with a handgun with her eyes closed).  And we knew that while prodigiously gifted, she had been broken by their experiments.  Her story was to have unfurled over the course of at least two seasons.  The movie focuses on the heart of what that story would have been.<br /><br />By paring down the movie into only River's story, other characters unfortunately got left to the side.  Book barely featured in the film.  Kaylee and Simon and even Jayne have much smaller moments.  Even Zoe is somewhat shunted off to the side.  In fact, theonly two characters who really get the amount of time that they deserve are River and Mal.  This was probably unavoidable.  Otherwise the main story would have been sacrificed just to get the other characters a few more moments.  But when the series ended, the number one question most fans had was, \\"What the heck is River's deal?\\"  So the film answers that question.<br /><br />Although I came to SERENITY after having seen FIREFLY several times, I've been amazed talking to others who saw only the movie how much they enjoyed it on its own.  And although I cannot put myself into their shoes, it is pretty obvious that the movie holds up nicely on its own.  A lot of this can be attributed to the fact that Joss Whedon focused his efforts more on the story than on giving all the characters a \\"fair\\" amount of air time.  You can correct this in a TV series, but not in a movie.  First and foremost, the movie tells a great story that answered many of the central questions that were dangling at the end of the series.  The movie introduces very few new characters.  The main one is the Operative, played by the marvelous Chiwetel Ejiofor.  The brilliant thing about the Operative is that he clearly sees himself as the hero of the story, the selfless one doing what has to be done to bring about a better world.  There is, in fact, a wonderful parallel between the Operator and Malcolm Reynolds.  The difference is that Mal at the time of the action in the film is already the person the Operative will later become.  Like the Operative, Mal was at one point a true believer, until he lost his faith at the Battle of Serenity Valley, an event captured in the first few minutes of the series as Joss Whedon wanted it to be broadcast.  And like Mal, the Operative at the end of this movie loses his faith in his cause.  [This is seen even more explicitly in the deleted scenes, where the Operative looks up at the nose of the ship with \\"Serenity\\" painted on it, and he asks Mal how he found something to live for afterwards.  Mal merely replies that he should get out of the blast area or he'll never find out.  The Operative, Mal hints, has to find his own path.]  While Mal lost his faith through defeat, the Operative loses his by no longer being able to pretend that his side is the right one, that he labors on the side of the angels.  To his credit, he remains a good man, only no longer allied to a particular cause.  Even before the events at the end of the film the Operative recognizes that the proper world, civilization itself, has no place for either him or Mal.<br /><br />SERENITY is a great movie, though it is very different from other exceptional Sci-fi films in that it is dependent for much of its appeal on the TV series.  I am a big believer in the superiority of television (at its best) over the movies.  If you value character and dialogue over all else (as I do), movies simply cannot compete with TV.  I defy anyone to show me a cop movie that can rival the final denouement in TV's THE SHIELD.  Or a fantasy series with the depth of pathos of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER.  Or a human interest drama with the depth of character of FRIDAY NIGHT LITHTS (as a test cast, just compare the film FNL with the vastly deeper and richer TV series).  It is simply an impossibility to get to know or develop a character in the 90 minutes of a movie compared to the 920 minutes of a single season of a TV series (though remember that if a series goes seven years, that expands to 6,440 minutes.  Now, not all TV series take advantage of this.  Although STARGATE SG-1 lasted for ten seasons, there was not much more character development at the end of the series than there was at the end of Season One.  But shows like  BUFFY, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, THE WIRE, THE SHIELD, THE WEST WING, ANGEL, PUSHING DAISIES, and FIREFLY take advantage of the huge inherent superiority of TV over film.  So one reason SERENITY is so good as a movie is the fact that it gets to ride piggyback on a very great TV series.<br /><br />Again, I am not sure that I recommend FIREFLY on Blu-ray.  It is better, but I'm not sure that it is so much better that it justifies the extremely hefty price tag.  But if you have a Blu-ray player and love FIREFLY and/or SERENITY, you will not regret upgrading to Blu-ray.  Plus, you have to keep in mind that SERENITY is not merely a must-see movie, it is a must-see-8-or-9 times movie.  I give it my strongest recommendation.ly replies that he should get out of the blast area or he'll never find out.  The Operative, Mal hints, has to find his own path.]  While Mal lost his faith through defeat, the Operative loses his by no longer being able to pretend that his side is the right one, that he labors on the side of the angels.  To his credit, he remains a good man, only no longer allied to a particular cause.  Even before the events at the end of the film the Operative recognizes that the proper world, civilization itself, has no place for either him or Mal.    SERENITY is a great movie, though it is very different from other exceptional Sci-fi films in that it is dependent for much of its appeal on the TV series.  I am a big believer in the superiority of television (at its best) over the movies.  If you value character and dialogue over all else (as I do), movies simply cannot compete with TV.  I defy anyone to show me a cop movie that can rival the final denouement in TV's THE SHIELD.  Or a fantasy series with the depth of pathos of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER.  Or a human interest drama with the depth of character of FRIDAY NIGHT LITHTS (as a test cast, just compare the film FNL with the vastly deeper and richer TV series).  It is simply an impossibility to get to know or develop a character in the 90 minutes of a movie compared to the 920 minutes of a single season of a TV series (though remember that if a series goes seven years, that expands to 6,440 minutes.  Now, not all TV series take advantage of this.  Although STARGATE SG-1 lasted for ten seasons, there was not much more character development at the end of the series than there was at the end of Season One.  But shows like  BUFFY, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, THE WIRE, THE SHIELD, THE WEST WING, ANGEL, PUSHING DAISIES, and FIREFLY take advantage of the huge inherent superiority of TV over film.  So one reason SERENITY is so good as a movie is the fact that it gets to ride piggyback on a very great TV series.    Again, I am not sure thatI recommend FIREFLY on Blu-ray.  It is better, but I'm not sure that it is so much better that it justifies the extremely hefty price tag.  But if you have a Blu-ray player and love FIREFLY and/or SERENITY, you will not regret upgrading to Blu-ray.  Plus, you have to keep in mind that SERENITY is not merely a must-see movie, it is a must-see-8-or-9 times movie.  I give it my strongest recommendation.
B000FVQLRA|5.0|I've watched \\"The Pianist\\" twice since it's 2002 release, and felt compelled to write a review after watching it tonight. This is a well-directed Holocaust movie by Roman Polanski, and the stellar acting by Adrien Brody [who deservedly won an Oscar for his role] makes \\"The Pianist\\" a truly memorable viewing experience.<br /><br />The story is based on the real-life experiences of Jewish pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman [played by Adrien Brody] during the Nazi occupation of Warsaw in WW II. The movie follows him from his piano playing days at Polish Radio, through the restrictions imposed upon the Jews by the Nazis, the move by Szpilman and his family to the Warsaw ghetto,how he is saved from deportation [whilst the rest of his family gets deported to Treblinka, an extermination camp], his role in the Jewish resistance movement, and finally his struggles in hiding on the Aryan side of Warsaw till war's end.<br /><br />The brutality of the Nazis is very effectively portrayed - scenes of Nazi violence against the Jews are usually portrayed in brief but potent scenes, leaving an indelible mark in the viewer's memory. One particular scene still haunts me - the Nazis have selected a group of Jews for deportation [including four members of Szpilman's family] and a young woman innocently asks the SS officer in charge where they're being taken. His response is a shot to her head - just like that, and her only crime was to speak up. There are many poignant scenes that are heartrending in their portrayal of human suffering - a grieving young mother who is beside herself as she smothered her own child to death to prevent the baby's cries from being heard, bodies of Nazi victims including young children, and also one particularly disturbing scene where an old man in a wheelchair is picked up by the Nazis [for being unable to stand up when the Nazis stomp into his family dinner] and thrown off the balcony. Though the scenes may appear random, the viewer is well aware that there was nothing random about the Nazis' intent - that of decimating the Jews.<br /><br />Adrien Brody as the pianist Szpilman effectively portrays a man who is tortured by his circumstances, yet bears all his suffering in silence - witnessing the atrocities around him, being separated from his family and learning of their tragic fates later, and being forced to endure the agony of incessant hunger whilst trying to stay alive. His indomitable spirit shines through in many scenes, especially the scene where he is asked by a German officer to play the piano - even in the midst of great hunger, and with fingers gnarled by sickness and starvation, Szpilman is able to play an achingly haunting piece that would have done a concert pianist proud.<br /><br />\\"The Pianist\\" is definitely a memorable Holocaust film - it even shows that not all Germans were monsters as exemplified by the humane German officer who helped Spzilman when he was in hiding. Though the movie evokes the horrors of the time it also captures the resilience of the human spirit under the most harrowing circumstances.hing random about the Nazis' intent - that of decimating the Jews.<br /><br />Adrien Brody as the pianist Szpilman effectively portrays a man who is tortured by his circumstances, yet bears all his suffering in silence - witnessing the atrocities around him, being separated from his family and learning of their tragic fates later, and being forced to endure the agony of incessant hunger whilst trying to stay alive.

B001P9KR8U|5.0|Director Danny Boyle's 'Slumdog Millionaire' is a touching, moving and completely riveting cinematic experience. I was blown away not just by its poignant story, but also by its striking contrast in cultural and societal differences from our own here in the Western Hemisphere. In addition to its compelling screenplay, it's also beautifully photographed and captures the backdrop of the dauntingly wretched conditions in the slums of modern-day India as meticulously and realistically as any movie can and probably ever will. The musical score is quite amazing and unlike any other I've ever heard, which hilights several intense dramatic sequences of chasing and running.<br /><br />The story opens up with Jamal Malik (Dev Patel), a seemingly uneducated teenager from the slums of Mumbai who gets a much coveted, one-in-a-million chance to escape from his hopelessly indigent existence by appearing on India's 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?' gameshow where contestants have a chance to win monetary prizes by answering a variety of trivia questions. He's had an unprecedented hot-streak on the show thus far by answering a rather difficult and seemingly esoteric series of questions and in the movie's opening moments, Jamal is just one question shy of winning the grand prize of 20,000,000 rupees. But the show is out of time before he has the opportunity and must reconvene the following night. Following the episode's airing, Jamal is arrested and detained after the police and the show's host (Anil Kapoor) suspect him of cheating. While in poilce custody, Jamal recounts through a series of vivid flashbacks to his childhood that brilliantly reveal how he knows the answers to all of the questions he has answered correctly.<br /><br />We learn that as children growing up in the squalid, nightmarish poverty of Mumbai's slums, Jamal and his older brother, Salim, were orphaned at a young age when their mother was killed in an attack from an angry Hindu mob on their shantytown. Together with their female companion, Latika (whom Jamal loves even as a child), the three band together as a scrappy, self-styled version of 'The Three Musketeers', their favorite literary work from school. They stick together and endure a wretched existence on the muddy streets that is at times despondent and depressing. But this is where the movie's message of hopefulness comes in as the three are a plucky group who display courageous fortitude and spirited resourcefulness despite their trying circumstances. Jamal and Salim become separated from Latika after escaping from a nefarious child exploiter where the two subsequently take to riding the many railroad trains crisscrossing India. The trains become a source of livelihood for the two brothers as they manage to eek out a scant subsistence on the trains by peddling to, hustling and in some cases outright stealing from the trains' passengers. There's even a rather funny passage in this part of the movie where Jamal and Salim end up at the Taj Mahal where they hustle tourists as faux tour guides and even steal their shoes to sell on the streets! The two brothers continue this for several years until they eventually end up in the booming metroplois of Bombay. Here, after becoming employed as a tea server at a mega communications call center, Jamal then gets the opportunity at appearing on the gameshow, something every teenager and young adult in his society longs for. It's at this moment the story segues back into the point we originally see in the movie's beginning. After being grilled and harshly interrogated by the police, Jamal is set free and allowed to continue on his final night of the gameshow after he becomes a national celebrity and hero to the public who demand to see him get his chance to win the grand prize. But having not seen his long-lost love Latika (Freida Pinto) in years, his shot at winning the jackpot is more about reuniting with her than it is about wealth.<br /><br />Slumdog Millionaire is a love storyat its core, but there are no sweeping romantic locations and visuals. Jamal, Salim and Latika grow up in a level of squalid, forlorn poverty that makes even the most impoverished American ghettos look like a vision of paradise by comparison. Still, it's surprising how much their culture has been influenced (or polluted) by the West. Interestingly enough, the poor of India are seeming to be as obsessed with gameshows and tv as we are, possibly because it's their sole lifeline to a better existence so few in their society get to experience. A wonderful movie that inspires and teaches us that true knowledge and wisdom comes not from age or education, but from the sum total of our life experiences. A beautifully irreverent and moving cinematic experience with one of the most amazingly original endings and credit sequences I've ever seen in a movie. Always interesting and at times fascinating. Quote me on that.t there are no sweeping romantic locations and visuals.

B001DSNF8C|4.0|This is a more cold-sided demeanor of 007, but exciting no less.  I took away a star because the ending felt incomplete; lacking closure at the end.  Other than that, it's worth the buy on Blu-ray.
B001B1R1HC|4.0|I have compared these recordings to 9 EMI CDs that I had bought previously on the same label which contain the same performances. This set offers no upgrade in sound. In fact, they sound a bit worse, with some filtering in the high frequencies. Why EMI continues to need to cut out all noise (and thus high frequency info in the music)is beyond me. If you've heard a piano live or a recording that does not filter the high frequencies, you sure notice the sound difference when the highs are filtered.     Yes, these performances are excellent and the box set is a neat way to collect all of his EMI recordings, but considering the price, you might be better served buying up the used copies of the earlier issues of this material. They are sure to surface now that this box has been released. I won't be selling any of mine, though.    Fans who are new to this pianist will do well to get this set, but do yourself a favor and show around. I got mine for $35 from a European online seller.
B00004WGAK|5.0|I first saw this movie about six years ago. I've watched it many times since. Marlon Brando's portrayal of Kid Rio is simply magnificent. His performance is powerful and compelling. \\"One-Eyed Jacks\\" is a classic tale of betrayal and revenge. The cast is outstanding with Karl Malden, Katy Jurado, Slim Pickens, and Pina Pellicer among others. I was especially moved by Pina Pellicer in her role as Louisa, who falls in love with Rio and becomes pregnant with his child. I also liked the unresolved ending, with Brando leaving her with the promise that he would return in the Spring when she would have her baby. With their obvious deep love for each other, there's no doubt in my mind that he would.<br />I've only scratched the surface in my description of this great film, but I think it's one of the best Westerns of all time.
B000UBMSB8|4.0|I'm one of those purists who wants to see things in their original form, no matter how \\"improved\\" they may have become over time. For that reason, I chose to watch the Theatrical Cut of Blade Runner first, because I figured this is the way it was meant to be seen before the tinkering began.<br /><br />There are two main differences that I know of: the voice-overs exist in the original, but not the Director's Cut; and the original has a happier, more hopeful ending than the Director's Cut.<br /><br />Ironically, I found both of these things in the Theatrical Cut very distracting and out-of-place. In fact, the voice-overs really only exist in four or five small points during the first hour of the movie (and one at the end) and I don't feel like they really add to the story. There was one specific moment when a character used a term and I figured out the definition on my own, but then Harrison Ford's voice came on the screen explaining the term. Very unnecessary.<br /><br />Similarly, where the movie ends in the Director's Cut is exactly where I thought it was going to end in the Theatrical Cut, and yet it kept going. The message that we take from that original ending is basically the same as the message conveyed in the final words of the movie, so again the scene was unnecessary.<br /><br />Finally, I just read that Ridley Scott filmed the original movie *without* the voice-overs or the extra final scene, but the studio felt (as they tend to do) that the voice-overs were needed to help the audience understand what was going on, and naturally they wanted a happier ending.<br /><br />The movie itself is great, and I think it's probably even better without the voice-overs and the original ending. Anyone who says otherwise has either given it real thought (admirable) or simply wants to like the original better than any altered version (not as admirable).<br /><br />So my point is, if you are trying to decide which version to watch, I recommend the Director's Cut (assuming nothing else major has changed in it) simply because that was the real vision of the director, and in my opinion what it leaves out actually makes the movie better.cause that was the real vision of the director, and in my opinion what it leaves out actually makes the movie better.
B00127RAJY|3.0|Being very inspired by the show, I decided to chose Jillian's video over the plethora of other choices out there.  I'm not a complete beginner, but I wouldn't say I'm advanced either.  I've done workout 1 and 2 so far.  They both get your heart rate up, and the next day you feel the sore muscles, so you know you've worked them.  I've found, however, that my sore muscles tend to only be the shoulders? - even though there's leg routines throughout.  I think this is due to the fact that she combines leg and arm exercises- and perhaps my legs need more work than my arms, so combining exercises may not be ideal.  (perhaps I just have really muscular legs?).  The other two complaints are the same I've seen elsewhere- can't forward through the introduction, and complete lack of instruction for the exercises.  Assuming that someone is a true beginner, this can be dangerous!  She gives important tips about a specific exercises about 1/2-3/4 of the way through it!  One would think she'd want to do that before the exercise or at least up front...  Overall, this is a good video, *if* you can research or know how to do exercises properly beforehand.

He receives a set of tapes from a girl who committed suicide and as he listens and begins to see the reasons (13 of them) why, his entire life spirals downward. The interesting and extremely clever point of view in the book (one from clay, the other from the voice on the tapes) makes this book completely and absolutely captivating, suspenseful, and absorbing.

B001PPGAIA|5.0|This movie was by far my favorite of 2008, even with such crowd-pleasers such as The Dark Knight and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. It's story is well formulated, honest, and believable. The acting is superb, with Hugh Jackman stealing his scenes and Nicole Kidman has the most developed character of any film she has ever done. Sprinkled intermittently with comedic moments, Australia is presented in a raw, emotional format with a hint of epic provided by the sweeping wide-angle shots of Australia's scenery. This film deserved more ratings and awards than it has won, and it's Baz's best movie yet. Yes. Better than \\"Moulin Rouge!\\". Best of 2008!
B0000028M7|5.0|First off, that Kelsey bitch down below is a retard and knows nothing about music. AIC are not post grunge (they were one of the first grunge bands way back in the 80`s stupid). LMFAO Daughtry is totally fake and staind if anything is post grunge because they didn`t come out until the mid 1990`s, and plus they ripped off every grunge band before them just like nickelback did. I don`t need to praise this album because everyone living in the 1990`s must of heard about this cd at some point and time. i just wanted to rip that retard kelsey apart. that person should be smacked in the face for dissing AIC.

B0014QNGA0|5.0|Though I've always admired the singing of Juan Diego Florez, I've questioned whether his voice is one the microphone does justice to. Having heard him on several occasions in the opera house, I've lamented the tendency of CDs to highlight an unpleasant stridency in his topmost notes and to fail to capture the sweeter, fully-rounded sound that distinguishes his live performances. Happily, this current CD does the Peruvian tenor far more justice. Though a few topmost note do sound bleated out, for the most part, along with his skills in the upper register and in fioritura passages, the frequent beauty of his voice in mid-range and softer passages for once is adequately captured. He is able to come off a high note into a dimuendo and sound tender without being saccharine.  I agree with an earlier reviewer that Florez' \\"Una Furtiva Lagrima\\" is a standout. He ornaments the familiar, beautiful aria in a tasteful way, and he emerges as second to no other current singer in this repertoire.  Simarly, his Rossini duet with an astonishingly fresh sounding Placido Domingo is a must hear for all opera fans. Bravo to the new king of bel canto.
B0010X745K|5.0|\\"The Mist\\", by Stephen King, is one of his best. It's a novelette that provides excellent scary reading, and the movie is equally compelling, unlike most movies which fall short of the stories that inspire them. Another one of King's stories that works wonderfully in both book and movie form is \\"Salem's Lot\\".

B001JNNE64|5.0|This BluRay release of of the original theatrical version of the film. If you notice the playing time and film rating you can see that this is the case. The Director's Cut version is 180 minutes and is rated R (due to some added nudity).    Personally I believe that they should have provided both versions. This is bluray after all and disc space is not a problem. I am pleased, however, that if they had to choose, they chose to go with the original. In my opinion, the added footage of the director's cut (although adding some context for understanding character motivations) detracted from the flow of the film. Moments of humor were lost because of where the extra scenes were added, and it made the pacing of the movie drag a bit at times.

I started reading it right away and I was quickly sucked into the pages of the book and into the world during WWII.  I love the fact that the book is narrated by death and all the characters in general  The book had its moments where I would smile because of the relationships between the characters, and those moments where I couldn't help but cry at those heart breaking moments.    One of my favorite quotes from the book is -   Often I wish this would all be over, Liesel, but then somehow you do something like walk down the basement steps with a snowman in your hands\\"  -Max    I would defiantly recommend this book to anyone.

0141439661|5.0|I thought that after all these years I might as well pitch in and give my two cents worth in regard to one of my favorite authors.  The plot has been well covered with these reviews and others, and even if they had not, you would have had to almost spent your life living under a rock not to be aware, so I certainly will not beat it to death here.<br /><br />Briefly though, this is the story of two sisters of the Dashwood family, who find themselves in a state of reduced circumstances upon the death of their father; a plight not uncommon during that era we know as Regency England.  This is the story of Emma Dashwood and her sister Marianne, the relationship between the two sisters, their family, friends, neighbors, and most importantly, possible suitors.  The story is told mostly through the eyes of Emma (sense?...I wonder), but through her eyes we get a wonderful picture of some very unforgettable characters.  Note:  If you watch very closely, you will see these same characters amongst us even to this day!  More about this later.<br /><br />Now, for one of my pet peeves; most of the members of the reading Western World will tell you that this is Austen's first novel and it is not her best work, or one reason or another.  Now being something of a semi-cultural barbarian, I have a problem with this statement.  While I will admit that Austen's later works are some of the best turned out in the English language, I do strongly feel that it is quite unfair to compare and contrast this work, Sense and Sensibility, with her later works.  Had this been the only novel Ms Austen had ever written, she still would have been listed with the literary greats on this work along.  It has all of the elements that her later works include; the insight to human nature, the subtle humor, the fantastic dialog, the complicated relationships, the unfortunate conditions many young ladies of that class suffered during this period of time and the raw emotions that are so understated in each and every line of her work.  I hate to beat dead horses, but the dialog in this work is along with the read!<br /><br />I take my peevishness further in noting that many refer to the situations, manners, mannerisms, attitudes and situations as being typically of those of only this period on English history.  As far as I can tell, most, if not all, of the situations encountered by the Dashwood sisters are with us even to this day and are merely cloaked in different clothing.  Emotions are emotions are timeless and what was true then, is true now, the truth just manifests itself a bit differently now than it did then.  We all want love, security, understanding and companionship; have since time began and I suspect we will until time ends.  Not all that much has changed.  I also strongly feel that if you feel that there is not a definite class system in existence today, as there was at the time this novel was written, then you well may be missing something. It may no be a blatant now as then, but it certainly is alive and well even to this day.<br /><br />Now all that being said, the bottom line is that this one fine bit of writing; a timeless bit of writing and the reader will certainly be much richer for having read it, and as a matter of fact, it does not hurt to give this one, along with Austen's other works, multiple readings over the years.  There is much we can learn here.  I've often told people that they should read at least one of Jane Austen's books each year just to keep in the front of their minds what writing is all about.  And for goodness sakes, I agree fully that there have been some very fine film adaptations of this work over the years and I certainly do recommend that you see them (I personally love several of them), but READ the book also!  You are missing out on a real treat if you do not.<br /><br />This review was of the Penquin Classic  edition, one of quite a number of editions I have laying around the house.

B000MV8ABS|5.0|Made with a very low budget and filmed over a period of several years (whenever they came up with more money), Phantasm is original and creepy.  It's also a bit more thoughtful than most horror films.<br /><br />A young boy, anxious about the further breakup of his family following his parents' death, becomes aware of sinister happenings at the local funeral home.  Seems the caretaker, the super-creepy horror legend 'The Tall Man' (the incomparable Angus Scrimm) is robbing graves and transforming the bodies into miniature creatures for use as slave labor in another dimension (I think).  Along with his brother and their balding ice-cream man buddy, they set about to stop the Tall Man and his flying crystal balls.  The full story is never really explained (what is the Tall Man?), but all of this works to the advantage of the film, which is well-paced and still pretty eerie.  In this era of over-production and effects-laden freak shows, Phantasm still has a pretty original idea behind it, which while not explained is still atmospheric.  Ultimately, the film is as much about the breakup of a family and a young boy's anxiety about abandonment, with the horror story as a dream-like metaphor.<br /><br />The film looks very good, even on a low budget.  In one of the extras Coscareli and Bannister mention that they didn't skimp on the cameras or lenses.  The extras also give insight into the making of a low-budget film in the 70s, quite a different effort from today.  This was a labor of love among friends and associates as everyone pitched in, from lugging equipment to coming up with makeup techniques and will remind folks of the stories of the making of Halloween, also from the same time.  This is in contrast to today, where the remakes of classic horror films are big-budget, ultra-slick affairs that use countless more dollars and resources and often fail to generate anything close to the atmosphere of the earlier entries.<br /><br />The music score by Fred Myrow and Malcolm Seagrave raises the stakes significantly, and is a highly recommended disc.  The spooky theme and some jazzy noodling are perfect, I'm surprised nobody has sampled the theme in another song (I could be wrong).<br /><br />This 2007 release is definitely an improvement on the 1999 version, as it adds a new commentary (including Scrimm), as well as a making-of documentary, also new.  And it looks great, though I'm beginning to wonder the limit on how good they can make older movies look anymore.  Either way, I think it's worthwhile upgrade, even if you have to 'double-up' or even 'triple-up' on your Phantasms.e stakes significantly, and is a highly recommended disc.

0143038419|5.0|This is a lovely book. Usually these kinds of journeys of self-exploration are fairly humorless, but Elizabeth Gilbert made me laugh a lot. SHe sets the stakes very high, very soon (a lot of crying on her bathroom floor), so we acre about her immediately and want to know if she's going to find some equilibrium in her life.
B001E5FYS8|5.0|I remember the day very well. August 7th, 1974. Nixon resigned -- the dark. And Philippe Petit, the wondrous light. He walked among the clouds, defying gravity, his soul alight with the fantastic. He did something no one will ever do, like building the pyramids, or parting the seas...an incredible feat of daring, intellectual brilliance and poetic madness grounded in fancy and intuition. My hat went off to him then, and with this wonderful documentary, told in non-linear terms, we again experience what the audience saw back 35 years ago. I know one of the conspirators and learned things that were not captured in the film. Philippe is my hero, and I am so glad, that like Everest conquerers we have him to lead the way to our imagination, fictional and non.
B0019FOC5E|1.0|We can't say this is the worst CD we've ever heard, but it ranks waaaaay up there. We have nothing against the acting talents of Meryl Streep and Pierce Brosnan and Colin Firth, but their vocal \\"talents\\" leave much to be desired.  Out of tune, off pitch and capable of causing more body upset than an cup full of kalamatas, the \\"singing\\" is more like croaking. Lauren Bacall and Katharine Hepburn and Rex Harrison could get away with it on stage. This Greek chorus cannot. When all is said and done the name of the game here is (save your) money, money, money.
067144901X|5.0|I bought this for my one year old daughter. It is so difficult at this age for her to pay attention to a book, let alone request one- but that has changed! She loves this book! She walks around saying, \\"la, la, la!\\" She makes all the animal noises, too. At bedtime, it makes her so happy- even when she is having a tantrum about bedtime, all we have to say is, \\"Moo Baa La?\\" and she will \\"moo\\" or \\"la\\" even through her tears. It is too cute. I have bought more of this author's books, and she likes several of them. I highly recommend!!

B00000JLWW|4.0|I gave this film 4 stars for its beautiful production values.  I wish a good script came with the movie.  While the script may have won an Oscar, it must be one of those great mysteries.  No adult in this movie speaks at a higher level than your average 15 year old.  No matter how old they are.  The bad man is Snidely Whiplash's younger brother and a Degas and a Picasso went down on the ship.  Still, the special effects and the disaster of the Titanic are extraordinary and I did cry at the end.  So it comes out to a draw.  I know of many movies which are better and many which are worse.

1416594884|3.0|The mysterious Chechen refugee who occupies the center of John Le Carre's latest novel is named \\"Issa.\\" And that's no coincidence. Issa is the Arabic name for Jesus. Much like Christ himself, this modern-day Issa is a devout yet baffling martyr worthy of love, devotion, fear and (some think) utter hatred.<br /><br />When he arrives in Hamburg, Germany, after escaping by sea, Issa has already survived months of brutal torture at the hands of Russian interrogators. His sudden appearance in Hamburg as a sickly, homeless wanderer sends everyone else into a frenzy. They all want to know one thing: Who is this guy, really?<br /><br />The novel's key characters include a family of Turkish immigrants, a human rights lawyer named Annabelle Richter, a shadowy yet kind-hearted &eacute;migr&eacute; banker named Tommy Brue, and a host of government investigators. Hamburg, as you may remember, was home for many of the 9/11 terrorists before they moved to the United States and the German authorities are particularly sensitive about their lack of \\"oversight\\" there.<br /><br />As the novel progresses, we soon learn that Issa's father was a nasty Russian military officer named Karpov who stashed a fortune in Tommy Brue's bank. His mother was a Chechen beauty who was raped -- and then embraced -- by Karpov. Now Issa has come to claim his father's secret fortune so he can A) Give most of it away to Muslim charities and B) Use some of it to attend medical school.<br /><br />HERE'S THE PROBLEM: The authorities think Issa is a Chechen terrorist planning another attack on the West. As they chase him around Hamburg, the other characters hide him in various locations until they can come up with a viable plan for distributing the money. (I won't give away the ending.)<br /><br />Alas, \\"A Most Wanted Man\\" is not Le Carre's best work. The plot is very thin, in most places, and the reader's main enjoyment comes from witnessing the spiritual transformation of Richter, Brue and others as they come into contact with Issa. In fact, the book reads more like an interior dialogue -- good people trying to help a refugee, while at the same time trying to come to terms with their own sordid pasts. With a little reworking, this book would probably work better as a stage play.<br /><br />One satisfying part of the story is learning about the ramshackle, disjointed approach to anti-terrorism in Germany. It's no wonder the 9/11 conspirators decided to use Hamburg as their home base -- it was patrolled by the \\"Keystone Cops.\\" (Let's hope the federal police and their brethren are more organized now!)<br /><br />In the closing credits at the end of the novel, we learn that part of the inspiration for \\"A Most Wanted Man\\" came from the real-life story of a Turkish refugee who was taken to Guantanamo Bay by U.S. authorities, despite very thin evidence against him. Clearly, Le Carre (himself a former diplomat) is disturbed by the violation of human rights in the war on terror -- no matter where it happens.<br /><br />Therein lies a challenge for Western nations today: How do we vigorously defend ourselves against terrorism without trashing our own principles, ideals and commitment to the rule of law? We'll find out soon enough if President Obama and his administration are up to the task.

Its uplifting and beautiful, while, YES, it is hard to watch, violent and visceral, its also beautiful and intriguing.<br /><br />Personally, I just love this movie, alot.  I think its often misunderstood, but its one of my favorites.

B0016AJU2C|5.0|When i first heard Alanis Morissette, it was in 1995 when \\"You Oughta Know\\" played on the radio.  My first reaction to Morissette and \\"You Oughta Know\\" was not positive - it was \\"what is this, why is this woman so angry, and what is this chip on her shoulder?\\"   Most of the \\"bubble gum\\" and synth-pop of the 1980s was beginning to fade, yet Morissette's anger just seemed too raw for me to absorb at the time. However as the subsequent singles from Morissette's \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" album were released, I soon began to see more than an angry young woman.   When I listened to \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" in its entirety, I realized that this album lived up to all of the hype.  Not only did this album garner critical acclaim, but it was one of the best selling albums of all-time.   Following that release, Morissette's subsequent albums would not nearly be as commercially successful, yet the high level of quality was still there.   On those subsequent works, Morissette would explore new avenues (mostly an integration of Indian Music into her sound) and take a more diplomatic and reconciliatory tone to her music.  By the mid 2000s, suddenly mainstream radio would forget about Morissette.  Still plowing on, in 2008, Morissette would release \\"Flavors of Entanglement\\".  While once again, she would not garner high commercial sales or mainstream radio airplay, Morrssette would hit another home run for an album.  In fact this collection easily ranks among Morissette's best work and really deserved serious consideration for 2008 Album of the Year.    The big change on this album is that for the first time since \\"Jagged Little Pill\\", Morissette turns sole production duties to an outside producer.   On \\"Jagged Little Pill\\", much credit (deservedly so) went to produce Glen Ballard for getting the most out of Morissette on that album.  On this album, Morissette turns production duties over to Guy Sigsworth.  Like \\"Jagged Little Pill\\", in which Morissette co-wrote songs with Ballard, Morissette teams up with Sigsworth on the songwriting.  The sound of this album is most interesting - incorporating more of a 2000s techno-electronic sound to her music.  It is on this style with Sigsworth really plays a key role.  While I've considered the electronic dance music movement of the 2000s to be mostly weak, it works beautifully on this album - especially when combined with the deep musical talents of Morissette.  The resulting music fusion is a unique sound that is just terrific and benefits from Morissette's deep lyrics.  The other thing is the raspy and scratching voice from Morissette heard on \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" is completely gone - replaced by a much more mature  (and even a \\"diva\\") voice.    Here is a synopsis of the collection.  I'm highly recommending the \\"Deluxe Edition\\" - which includes five \\"bonus\\" tracks.    \\"Citizen of the Planet\\":  When you listen to this track, it sounds like vintage Morissette. This album starts off with what is now trademark Morissette Indian music.  While we hear the mature voice, the chorus has the trademark scratching vocals.    \\"Underneath\\": Again we hear the some great near \\"diva\\" like vocals by Morissette.  The chorus has a real \\"hook\\" to it. Much of this song has a classic Morissette feel to it - including the lyrics that deal with a broken relationship.    \\"Strait Jacket\\": Here we hear the first of the techo/electronic sound.  The chorus very much is catchy and has a dance feel to it.  Great vocals by Morissette as well.    \\"Versions of Violence\\": Great segue from \\"Strait Jacket\\" goes right into this song.  More electronic/techo sounds.  The song has a haunting quality.  Another great track.    \\"Not as We\\":  This is a piano power ballad by Morissette.  Once again, great vocals.    \\"In Search of the Vulnerable Man\\":   Morissette demonstrates great vocal ranges on this song.  The techno sound has a slower beat, but it also helps create a mantra-like sound on this track.  There is an synth-orchestral sound present as well.\\"Moratorium\\": This track has some Indian influence and haunting elements as well.  Once again the electronic sound is slower.  Both the slower techno sound earlier in the song and Morissette's voice work beautifully.  Toward the end, the song goes into a \\"trance\\"-like sound as the tempo picks up.    \\"Torch\\": Another piano power ballad.  This song has the reconciliatory tone found on earlier Morissette albums.  Morissette's voice really is strong on the chorus.    \\"Giggling For No Reason\\":  This is another techno/electronic sound with some of the highest tempo of all of the tracks on this collection.    In fact, I think this track makes the best use of the electronic instrumentation to enhance part of the song.    \\"Tapes\\": Another place where Morissette delivers the power vocals.   While more of a power ballad, this song does make use of both electronic and string instrumentation.    \\"Incomplete\\":  This song had a mainstream radio-friendly feel to it.  The acoustic guitar gave this song more of vintage Morissette song.    The following five tracks are found on the \\"Deluxe Edition\\":    \\"Orchid\\": Another vintage Morissette sound.   Good combination of acoustic guitar with some lighter electronic sounds.    \\"The Guy Who Leaves Me\\": This song is a classic 2000s techno/electronic song.   Morissette's vocals sound more like her earlier days.   The song almost has an \\"alley-cat\\" feel to it.  Great track.    \\"Madness\\": This is another piano ballad, but I wouldn't call it a \\"power ballad\\".   More great vocals by Morissette.    \\"Limbo No More\\": The song incorporates some orchestral sounds to start the song out.  Here Morissette demonstrates some great power vocals and ranges.   Nice incorporation of electronic sounds.    \\"On the Tequila\\":  This might be the best song on the whole 16 song collection.   Outstanding song highlighted by use of a ukulele (and more electronic sounds).  Alanis uses a near spoken word vocal during the vocals as she takes us on a journey with \\"keeping up with her old friends\\".   Superb effort.    Overall, this album warranted serious consideration for 2008 Album of the Year.  Simply a great album and highly recommended.
B000LPQ6DE|2.0|This adaptation has 2 problems; it is too short. The first part with Jane's childhood and her aunt can have a whole chapter. The second at Lowood school needs another whole chapter. Important literary characthers like Mr. Brocklehurst & Miss.Temple are barely seen or left out.  This novel has a lot of psicological evolution with Jane and Mr.Rochester that simply needs more screen time.  Second problem is a modest or low budget;cinematography is too dark and poor. Few fill and background light is used so characthers are not separated from the background.

I will have to admit that it is harder than you would think for a routine that's only 20 minutes long. So I think I might be more out of shape than I thought, although my husband says that I'm \\"under worked\\". lol After the third day I was able to only have to catch my breath at two different stages during the circuit (asthma), and found other areas much easier to deal with... even able to do the advanced move in some areas!!! I highly recommend this DVD for anyone looking to make a change...

014144116X|5.0|Wow. This book was written in the 1920's. Before Indian independence and before the separation of Hindu and Islam. When read with this knowledge it really is an incredible novel and explains (indirectly) the many differences between the Hindu and Muslim and British occupiers. It's essentially about the interaction of people from different cultures. I watched the David Lean film after reading the book and , although there were small differences, it was an excellend portrayal of the book.  Why is it it in top 100 list? For me it's because of Forster's incredible descriptions and the way he paints a picture with these descriptions. Words to be tasted. Words to be scented.  Sometimes the absence of description also adds to the mystery that is India. Wow.
B00004TZU8|3.0|Dutch (Harrison Ford) is a DC police sergeant detailed to Internal Affairs who discovers after a plane crash that his late wife was having an affair of her own. This leads him to Congresswoman Kay Chandler (Kristin Scott Thomas) who is running for re-election and coping with the grief of learning her husband died on the plane crash as well.    It seems Dutch's wife and Chandler's husband were flying together on that plane as man and wife.  As unlikely as that scenario is in post - 9/11 reality, it could have happened back in 1999 when Sidney Pollack first released the film.     Being a cop, Dutch has to know the details of the affair.  He drags Kay reluctantly along with him and the two of them begin to feel the inevitable attraction.  Mostly the main plot of this story moves at a snail's pace.  More interesting is Dutch's investigation of Det. George Beaufort (Dennis Haysbert) for murder, which sadly takes a back seat.      \\"Random Hearts\\" is a must for Harrison Ford fans. If you like slow emotional drama, you may also enjoy this film.  The soundtrack is excellent.      Rebecca Kyle, February 2009

6305428050|4.0|Elizabeth Shue has been hanging out on my pedestal ever since this movie rocked the theaters way back in 1987. And with mad respect to her Oscar-nominated part in LEAVING LAS VEGAS, it's Chris Parker, the Chicagoan babysitter, who leaves me with the indelible impression. Dunno how many times I paid (*cough*snucked in) to see ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING in the theaters, but, just like Brad, that acne-harried Anderson kid, my high school crush on Elizabeth Shue was fierce and strong and kinda pathetic.<br /><br />Things begin to veer towards suckville for suburban high school senior Chris Parker when her boyfriend cancels their anniversary date and then she gets saddled with a last-minute babysitting gig. Off she drives to the Andersons, where awaits a routine evening of minding smitten 15-year-old Brad and his younger Thor-worshipping sister Sara. But a frantic phone call from Chris's friend Brenda - stranded at a downtown bus station and in desperate need of a pick-up - has Chris reluctantly packing her charges in her mom's station wagon and, joined by Brad's randy, gate-crashing best bud Daryl, heading out to the City. But the weirdness doesn't really start until the car blows out a tire on the expressway, leaving Chris and the kids braving the seamy 'hoods of downtown Chicago, penniless and very worried. Especially when the creepy, hook-for-a-hand tow truck driver rolls up...<br /><br />Admittedly, I'm biased. I hold ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING in rose-colored regard, having been weaned on this sort of teen cinema in the '80s. But I get that this is a dated movie nowadays. Thing is, when you park yourself somewheres to peep this flick, don't look too much for hard-hitting realism. ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING, more than anything else, is a comedy fable, and a gentle comedy fable at that, despite the inner-city escapades the kids stumble into. Although I'd like to think that some of the shady characters the kids encounter really would lend a helping hand (or hook) in real life.<br /><br />There's a lot of zany popping up, but the ever appealing Elizabeth Shue is like the serene eye of the storm. She infuses her character with a certain calm and composure, as well as resourcefulness and cheek. Not to say that she doesn't get shaken up in spots, because she does faint in one scene. But girl isn't quite your shrinking violet. In fact, she unveils unexpected reserves. So, no, it's not only Shue's terrific looks which hooked me in back in the day. Chris earns her babysitting wages as she faces off against a car boosting ring, rival gangs on the El train, and *gulp* a mean-faced bluesman who insists that &#34;Nobody leaves this place without singing the blues.&#34; Along the way, she gets a measure of getback at her weasely boyfriend and then lives out the title to the film's opening song.<br /><br />There are several cute running gags here. One such has folks mistaking Chris for a nekkid magazine centerfold, and this actually ties into the film's McGuffin, a certain adult magazine containing incriminating notes for which the chop shop mobsters are chasing the children. Actually, one of the best lines happens when the head thug can't find the magazine, in which he'd jotted down details of a business deal, and a henchman shamefacedly owns up: &#34;I... uh... took the Playboy upstairs. There was this... article.&#34; Another ongoing joke has a very cool payoff and deals with Sara's obsession with Thor. And, lest we forget the reason the kids are in the City, the camera finds time to occasionally cut back to Bus Station Brenda as she experiences her own misadventures, the lowlight of which features a kitten-petting scene. Heh. Poor Brenda.<br /><br />But, hands down, the best and warmest moment of the film - and actually one of my favorite moments in all of cinema - has Chris and the children performing the &#34;Babysittin' Blues&#34; in that tough blues joint. It's hard to top that act.<br /><br />Several well-known actors have cameos: Bradley Whitford as Mike, the scuzzball boyfriend; Vincent D'Onofrio as the garage mechanic to whom the Thor-obsessed little sister takes a shine; and a pre-sexy Penelope Ann Miller as Bus Station Brenda. But the standout supporting actor is this guy, Calvin Levels, who shines as Joe Gipp, the car thief who may (or may not) turn out to be a good dude after all.<br /><br />This film is more fluff than grit, I get that. The two teens, Brad and Daryl, are borderline annoying, yes, and the film is soaked in that dated 1980s sensibility. But it's also got more feel-good moments than not, when you can't help but root for the babysitter as she goes above and beyond. And the film is funny. ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING is a must-see for two things. The quite awesome, high-spirited &#34;Babysittin' Blues&#34; number. And Elizabeth Shue. By the way, if you're wondering why Elizabeth Shue hasn't done more films in her career, it's because it's not often that I let her off my pedestal.<br /><br />Dammit, Elizabeth Shue, you get back on that pedestal!ley Whitford as Mike, the scuzzball boyfriend; Vincent D'Onofrio as the garage mechanic to whom the Thor-obsessed little sister takes a shine; and a pre-sexy Penelope Ann Miller as Bus Station Brenda.

That was the question Malcolm Gladwell wanted to answer with his newest book, Outliers: The Story of Success.<br /><br />He came up with some unusual answers. He says that we usually expect a success story to be full of information about intelligence and ambition. Perhaps we should be looking for more information about such things as their family, their birthplace, or even their date of birth.<br /><br />In a study of geniuses, business tycoons, rock stars, lawyers, pilots, and computer programmers, he examines outliers. Outliers are the men and women who do things that are out of ordinary.<br /><br />Gladwell maintains that outliers have help along the way. Their achievement is less about talent than it is about opportunity. And most interestingly, it is a community around them that prepares them properly for the world that helps them to recognize opportunities and take advantage of them. Their uniqueness comes from the fact that many of these opportunities are such that no one else can see them or is prepared to step up to them. These opportunities progressively allow an accumulation of advantage that leads to success beyond comparison.<br /><br />There are lots of interesting stories to illustrate the concept. For example, he explains what psychologists have discovered that explains why in a sport such as hockey...when you evaluate elite players...the odds are that nearly half of them will be born during the months of January through March. By being born during that time period, they tend to be physically bigger than players born progressively later in the year. Being bigger they start with a slight advantage that leads to learning experiences that may come in the form of word of mouth exchanges. This learning results in selection to all-star teams with better coaching, better teammates, more games, and more practice.<br /><br />One of the other stories you will want to read is about pilots. Why is it statistically true that you are safer in a plane flown by the co-pilot than when the pilot is at the controls?<br /><br />How do outliers convert the accumulated advantages into what Gladwell calls meaningful work? And how does meaningful work become the tip of the success iceberg that we normally see: intelligence and ambition? You will have to read the book...I can't share that advantage with you by word of mouth.it statistically true that you are safer in a plane flown by the co-pilot than when the pilot is at the controls?

B001CTA1S4|5.0|\\"Doubt\\" is a terrific and engaging film with a wonderful cast led by Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Meryl Streep.  Both deserve accolades.  Their performances are stunning.<br /><br />Roman Catholicism is beset with contradictions.  It is a religion that has survived the ages despite itself.  It also has much to answer for and it has harmed many of its most fervent adherents.  In a broad sense, it is these issues that are touched upon in \\"Doubt\\".<br /><br />Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays a priest (Father Flynn) within an inner city American diocese in the 1960s.  He seems good at his role but he is forced to confront Meryl Streep's Sister Aloysius who is principal of the diocesan school.  She comes to the view that Flynn is taking an unhealthy interest in an African American boy.  Unhealthy to point that there is some vague degree of sexual interference.  Flynn is vehement in his denials and the Sister has little proof.  She largely relies upon her own intuition.  The film is thus based around how the two main characters deal with the situation.<br /><br />Without wishing to reveal too much, the film ends with much doubt still remaining.  The church continues to be bound by its own contradictions.  It continues to stumble on while failing to address underlying issues.<br /><br />Hoffman and Streep are superb in their roles.  Both have been nominated for Oscars and deservedly so.  This film is absolutely captivating and is one of the must see films of 2009.
B0000549B0|4.0|I had heard about this movie, actually my parents had talked about it a couple of times, but I really had no idea what it was about.   I finally saw it and, boy, what a cool movie!     Nicely directed by Henry Koster HARVEY demonstrates great imagination, something that I'm starting to notice with newer films today.  It was written with sensitivity by Mary Chase and Oscar Brodney.    James Stewart in the lead role is just great.  He always was in all of his movies.      This one was a special imaginative undtertaking
B00000IREA|4.0|This 1968 Sci-Fi movie - based on the adult (French) comic, Barbarella, by Jean-Claude Forest - is a hilarious romp for Jane Fonda (Barbarella) in a journey that is truly out of this world.<br /><br />Set in the 40th Century - and seemingly a time where psychedelic \\"blob\\" patterns are really cool - Barbarella is on a journey from Earth to the planet SoGo to locate the famous Dr. Durand Durand (Milo O'Shea). The mission penetrates deeply into Barbarella; she has \\"contact\\" with a human resident on SoGo, meets and greets an angel, Pygar (John Phillip Law), and has an incredible experience with the Excessive Machine.<br /><br />The tongue-in-cheek fun has propelled the movie into the galaxy of cult classics, with an orbit that defies time.
B00005JM8V|5.0|I have a good friend who is a WWII veteran. He liberated one of the concentration camps. He has always refused to talk about what he saw there. He said he couldn't possibly put words together that would describe it. This film, with stunning simplicity, does just that. It shows us just how depraved and callous the Holocaust was, and just how easy it was for those who were not its victims to go along with it whether through indifference or malice.<br /><br />This film should be required viewing for everyone, everywhere. The Holocaust is over, but similar acts are going on in the world each and every day. Seeing this film will impart a sense of alarm and urgency. If everyone saw this film the day when this insanity stops might come a little sooner.<br /><br />If crying in front of other people makes you uncomfortable, then make sure you watch this alone.

068484267X|5.0|What more can be said about Frank McCourt's Pulitzer Prize-winning memoir?  We readers can simply revel in McCourt's literary achievement by treating ourselves to more of his unique kind of prose.  In addition to Angela's Ashes, his astonishingly short writing career has produced two sequels - 'Tis and Teacher Man - that entertain us further as we take in scene after enchanting scene of this man's extraordinary life.<br /><br />And an extraordinary life truly 'tis.<br /><br />To read McCourt's memoirs is to experience the art of the possible and the power of the human spirit to triumph over even the worst of hardships.  What McCourt accomplishes as an adolescent and then as a man in merely surviving a childhood of abject poverty and despair is remarkable.  And then to achieve critical acclaim and the height of commercial success as an author is nothing short of spectacular!  Winning the Pulitzer Prize is but icing on the cake!<br /><br />If a memoirist's place in the world can be secured through his ability to spin an eminently readable story about his life that both edifies and entertains, then McCourt has more than secured his place.  Generous and deeply satisfying are the lines that seemingly leap without effort from McCourt's pen.  His writing has a uniquely winsome style that both charms the reader and leaves him craving more.  We so enjoy reading about the McCourts that we wait breathlessly to find out how a given situation will play out.<br /><br />McCourt draws us in with sentences that are light and airy and that refuse to collapse under the weight of an editor's pen.  Punctuated sparingly, McCourt's writing reads much as a child relating a story would speak and delights us in its lighthearted tone and earthiness.  A refreshing honesty permeates his prose and leaves us wondering how long it took this unusual author to perfect his storyteller's gift.  An irreverent, distinctively Irish brand of irony also underlies much of McCourt's work, and in Angela's Ashes it fully grabs us and refuses to let go.<br /><br />But McCourt's genius as a writer extends infinitely beyond his writing style.<br /><br />His work is defined by his gentle handling of the depressing and the desperate, the miserable and the forlorn, the painful and the unspeakable.  With uncommon humor and grace, McCourt relates the events of his childhood amid poverty, disease, and neglect in Limerick, Ireland in the 1930s.  Hunger and disease stalk the McCourt children from the shadows of the Limerick 'lanes' they call home.  Every day brings another test of wills with the vermin that multiply and flourish in the foul, squalid conditions.<br /><br />A test even for stoic, young Frank, three of his siblings die as small children.  Yet despite their difficult circumstances, Frank, Malachy and their younger brothers never succumb to the despair of the downtrodden nor do they accept the hopelessness of their lot in life.  While their mother 'stares into the fire' and continually ruminates about her family's plight, the boys play on, finding ways to entertain themselves even in their destitute state.<br /><br />Their father, Malachy, sometimes employed, more often than not, 'on the dole', frequently succumbs to the pull of the bottle and in the process fritters away what little money he earns as an itinerant factory worker.  He is seldom employed for longer than a few months and eventually drops out of his family's orbit altogether while working in a London munitions factory.  Frank seems to endure his father's chronic alcoholism and irresponsibility with a sort of world weariness that masks a deep, unrequited love.<br /><br />Perhaps most poignant in McCourt's writing is this peculiar loyalty the McCourt boys have toward their father that extends beyond what could or should ever be expected.  Ironically, the boys continue to hold their father in high esteem while he repeatedly demonstrates all the reasons they should not.  In Angela's Ashes, McCourt never blameshis father for 'drinking the pint' while his children go hungry, preferring instead to portray his father as an eccentric study in contradictions. (Malachy refuses to accept handouts, for instance; it is beneath him.  Yet he readily accepts public assistance from the Irish government.)<br /><br />With his father out of the picture and his family sinking further into poverty, Frank resolves to assume the role of breadwinner.  His determination results in a series of jobs that put food in his brothers' bellies and pride once again in their hearts.  Frank reaches for responsibility as much as his father studiously avoids it.  Thankfully for the McCourt brood, Frank is a serious-minded adolescent who deeply loves his brothers.  He will stop at nothing to keep them alive - even petty crime.<br /><br />By turns raucously funny and painfully sad, Angela's Ashes is a joy to read.  Through a gifted writer, we experience the resilience of children trying to make sense of the world in deplorable conditions, choosing to reject their impoverished state rather than be condemned by it.  And we are witness to the power of the human spirit to overcome adversity.  Their father alcoholic, their mother depressed, their home rife with infectious disease and gnawing hunger lurking around every corner... the McCourt boys somehow find a way to beat the odds.<br /><br />That they are alive to regale us with their stories is both a tribute to the unquenchable spirit of the Irish and a gift to all humanity.<br /><br />To see the humor in life's most desperate circumstances is to learn life-affirming lessons.  To laugh along with Frank McCourt is to be let in on an exceptional author's 'wee bit of fun.'<br /><br />Magnificent!ry, preferring instead to portray his father as an eccentric study in contradictions.

B001GKJ2FM|2.0|I know this review will be an unpopular one, so I am prepared for the many \\"not helpful\\" votes this will get.  Take your best shot.  That being said ...<br /><br />Yikes.  I have always been a Streep fan, but I have never seen anything like this.  I don't know what they did to her, but throughout most of this film - I will blame the director, choreographer and editors - she is so manically jubilant and expressive and hyper-active that I was afraid the poor woman had developed an addiction to chrystal meth!<br /><br />In fact, most of the cast fairs poorly.  Only Julie Walters seems to realize that she is in the midst of one enormous joke.  For all the mania and energy forced upon these people, their dealiest flaw is that they seem to be taking this whole story seriously.<br /><br />The term \\"Greek Chorus\\" has never been so horrifyingly real.  Words cannot express.<br /><br />Two stars though because I can see a future rainy Sunday with tequila shots lined up on the coffee table, a double feature of Mama Mia! and Can't Stop the Music, and a really big headache afterward. Now that's fun!.

It was a tragic story and Jodi does a fantastic job of capturing the heart break of everyone involved, but there were a few loose ends that I was hoping would be tied up.  This book deserves a continuation. I want to know....what now?  It's a great story and I was happy with the end, but it left me wanting more.

B001QD7SF0|3.0|I'm putting myself down in the disappointed category. Simply put other there are a few shining moments, but I was hoping for so much more. Bruce says this is an album that requires repeated listenings to fully \\"get it\\". I hope he's right. For the record I'm as big a fan as he's got out there. Over the past 4 decades his music has taken me places, stirs my emotions and giving me more joy than any other artist alive. But no, this is not his best album since Born to Run by a long shot. Put down the Boss Koolade. I'd put Darkness, River, Born in the USA, Tunnel of Love and a few others well ahead of this album. Hell...Human Touch and Lucky Town are even better.  This continues the trend of Devils & Dust and Magic. Maturing artist to be sure but in end it all comes down to the songs. 31 years after my first Springsteen concert and 1 year after my last with many shows in between, I know what I'm looking for from him and this isn't it. The lyrics are the strongest ingredient of the album. Bruce's understated vocals, easy listening melodies are pleasant at best. But who ever buys a Springsteen album or concert ticket just to be pleased? For my money I need the \\"House rockin', pants droppin', earth shockin', hard rockin', booty shakin', love makin', heart breakin', soul cryin'... and, yes, death defyin' Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band.  Unfortunately, they're nowhere to be found on this one.
B001J1O848|5.0|I simply did not think this would be as good as it was--and I have NO idea why I thought it would be that way, but I was wrong--BIG TIME. I like Liam Neeson, but putting him in the same category as Jason Bourne, James Bond or Jack Bauer? I don't think so...well guess what? Liam was awesome as a father bent on undeniable, raging vengeance after his one and only daughter is abducted shortly after arriving in France.<br /><br />The first 15 minutes of the movie sets the stage for what follows, and when the rubber hits the pavement, man oh MAN hold ON! We see all the behind the scenes set-up you'll need to accept Liam as a divorced father who spent way too much time away from family, ultimately paying the price as he finds himself divorced, complete with a relationship with his daughter on life-support. He clearly regrets missing out on quality time with his little girl, and attempts to forge a closer bond with her when she deceives him into granting her permission to fly to Europe to tour museum's when its nothing more than a ruse to cover her desire to hop from one country to another seeing one concert after another.<br /><br />When his daughter fails to call him at the appointed time, he desperately tries to get in touch with her, and when he finally does, he discovers that she is moments away from being abducted. He fights back the urge to fall apart and gives her some valuable advice and sets out to find and then punish those responsible.<br /><br />What an adrenaline RUSH. The film quite literally flies by so fast that before I realized it, the movie was over. At first it felt like I had been there barely an hour, but it was longer than that--it just flew by quite rapidly. I seriously doubt that Liam will receive any acting awards for this roll, but I honestly don't care. His acting was superb (as usual) but this type of film is usually ignored at award shows anyway, so no big loss there, right?<br /><br />In short: if you enjoyed or really loved any or all three Bourne films with Matt Damon, give 'Taken' a shot, I believe you will be pleasantly surprised at how honestly GOOD it is. Personally, I loved it, and can hardly wait to see it again.give 'Taken' a shot, I believe you will be pleasantly surprised at how honestly GOOD it is.

0316017922|5.0|This book was right on target when it talks about how we must take into account many different variables and not only IQ scores when talking about how someone was able to become so successful.     Malcolm Gladwell talks about how the environment has influence over us. For example, before Bill Gates even went to college he already has access to computers that were far more advanced and superior than the ones used by some university students because he was attending a very expensive school. By having been born into a wealthy family he was able to surround himself with things that others might not have access too.     While this is not to say that his success was handed over to him, it does cause one to think. I'd say this has been one of the more thought provoking books I've read lately.
B000UD0ESA|4.0|I liked the whole concept of this movie -A  bounty hunter in the future, played by Harrison Ford,  is told to terminate four replicant beings.     Based on a novel by Philip K. Dick,  Hampton Fancher and David Webb Peoples (who also wrote UNFORGIVEN) did a very good jobe with the screenplay.    Ridley Scott directed and gives us some exciting, albeit brutal, pursuits.  Scott seems to be very good at this kind of genre film, or action films.    Harrison Ford is perfect in the lead role.    Sean Young, Edward James Olmos, M. Emmet Walsh,  Daryl Hannah and the other actors also are perfect in their roles.    The music by Vangelis  and the cinematography by Jordan Cronenweth are excellent.
159102594X|5.0|This is it, a killer. I have searched for a good fantasy novel for over  20 years. Leafing through the various books, always disappointedly turning away left to my own imagination. So many possibilities untouched in so many childish books - elves, dragons, romance, derivative magic - fantasy literature for me was an unfullfiled readers dream. Don't get me wrong, I like anything that stems from imaginative mind. Only, fantasy was, at least im my mind, land for broken dreamers running away from everything that was truly creative. And then, one day and by pure chance, I have stumbled upon this: The First Law Trilogy. At first, out of pure scepticism, I wasn't convinced. But then it strucked me like a sorcerers hammer. My vision started to blur, my mind spinning with awe. Characters, plot, esoteric magic system, subdued humor waiting to burst but never doing it, atmosphere at the same time deeply human and indifferent to anything living, smells and visions coming to life - it is fulfilling to the point of complete satiety. A few books can do that - after you read them, you do not want to pollute your mind again with something else for months. This is work of such a scope that future generations will wonderingly scratch their heads. We, readers of present moment, can only humbly try to understand why the fantasy will never be the same after this...<br />No comparison, one of a kind trilogy, it will linger in your soul long afer you leave the words of its pages on a bookshelf.

B001GZ6QBU|2.0|There was so much hype about this movie that I expected a really exciting ride. Instead I honestly felt that it was a dark, disturbing and much too graphic movie. Mental illness, terrorism and graphic violence were the focus of this movie. If that appeals to you, then this is for you.<br /><br />There were so many deaths happening (and very horrifically) to innocent people that I was really contemplating turning it off. While I did want to see what would happen just enough to hang on and watch it to the end, it felt more stressful than exciting.<br /><br />The character development, personal relationships and the inner conflict of Bruce Wayne that have made the prior batman movies so interesting took a back seat to the psychotic mind of the joker. Batman was almost the supporting actor to the joker and it was more disturbing than fascinating. The prior Batmans (Val Kilmer, Michael Keaton...) had so much more to work with. While Christian Bale did a good job with what he had, he didn't have much to work with.<br /><br />Even the action sequences were not that intriguing. I was almost bored at times.<br /><br />I've enjoyed many of Heath Ledger's films, and I agree that he did a wonderful job. Yet it was difficult to watch. I think that if you like slasher movies and horror flicks you may like this. This is absolutely not for kids. Someone was comparing it to Ironman, and there's no contest. Ironman wins hands down on so many levels.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is my least favorite Batman movie and would not really recommend it.

0312340958|5.0|In 1962, young Karen Armstrong, a sincere, earnest spiritual seeker, entered a Catholic convent at age 17 in order to experience God.  The 16th-century Ignatian regimen was supposedly designed to empty the nuns of their selves so they could be filled with God.  But the highly demanding environment and the incredibly harsh and invalidating attitudes of her superiors did more to break the nuns' spirits than their egos.  About half the original 10 postulants survived the original training before noviceship; one more dropped out before the final vows of professed nuns; one more left about five years later.  As one of Armstrong's superiors later admitted to her, the training was outdated and excessively strict.<br /><br />Constant criticism and self-criticism, the sensation of never measuring up, grim, joyless obedience to often senseless rules, the squelching of warmth, friendship, and humor, and the suppression of questioning of faulty procedures were Armstrong's daily bread at the convent.  So why did she stick it out for seven years?  To be sure, she was smart enough to notice the cracks in the ceilings and walls of her training.  But seven years of programming or \\"conditioning\\" as Armstrong calls it, had also broken her spirit enough to cause her to believe that she was largely at fault for not trying harder.  In short, she stuck it out because she was loyal, sincere and earnest.  She finally realized what a bad match she and her Order were, and eventually got a dispensation from her vows and returned to secular life.<br /><br />May this book be a warning to earnest followers of any and all traditions.  Whether a Catholic convent, a Hindu ashram, a Buddhist monastery or a lay human potential movement, if the environment stifles joy, friendship, creativity and critical thinking; if the Superior, Guru, Roshi, Rinpoche or group leader is considered to be always right and is never questioned or challenged; if there is no one to turn to within the community when one has doubts about the doctrine, practice or leadership; if rules are more important than people, it is time to examine whether barely surviving as opposed to fully thriving in such circumstances is worth the suffering.  Thank you, Karen Armstrong, for this wonderfully validating book.he doctrine, practice or leadership; if rules are more important than people, it is time to examine whether barely surviving as opposed to fully thriving in such circumstances is worth the suffering.

B001ILFUDM|5.0|I will treasure this release of Pinocchio, which has never before seen a deluxe treatment.  Today's CG-minded braintrusts such as John Lasseter could do well to witness the truly marvelous multi-dimensional artwork and storytelling that was possible once without a single mouse click.  Though CG is now king, those at Disney and elsewhere who fired all the talented 2D animators, have only proven their one-dimensional thinking.  What I have seen of this new Bluray release is truly stunning.  A pity that we will likely never see this type of animation again.  Freeze any frame in this dvd of Pinocchio, and you will see something truly art gallery-worthy. Perhaps with the Bluray releases of Disney classics to come, the collection of executives at Disney may see a value in one day producing top quality Disney 2D animation that could stand alone in the industry.  John Lasseter seems a genuinely talented man who respects the work of the many animation landmarks in the long and marvelous Disney history. Maybe one day he'll listen to the ghosts of past animators such as Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston, and wake up to realise that there are many of us out here who wish for a return to the storybook beauty that can be witnessed from start to finish in Pinocchio.  Lady and the Tramp....Beauty and the Beast...the Lion King....remember how you felt when you watched them as a kid?  They had those unforgettable characters that started out as a line from an artist's brush, instead of as a polygon on a computer screen in today's animated movies.    And if we wish hard enough upon a star, maybe it too is a dream that can come true.  If it worked for a wooden puppet, maybe it can work for me, and those who are like-minded.

Jimmy Falon was mildly amusing when he would crack up like an idiot on SNL during his skits but he should never be in another movie. He is horrible.

Probably his worst movie ever.
0061139378|3.0|Coraline by Neil Gaiman is a glorified short-story that has some mild chill factors that would probably be better for a younger audience.<br />\\"Coraline\\" brings us the story of a young girl who is as curious as the Benjamin Button case. Since she and her parents moved into their new flat she takes every opportunity to explore every inch especially since her overworked parents just don't seem to have enough time for her. One day she stumbles upon a small door. She soon finds this door leads her to a flat just like hers. This \\"other flat\\" even has its own version of her bedroom, her kitchen and her parents. But it's not the same bedroom, kitchen and parents. These parents do have time for her. These parents make the perfect dinner and always want to be with Coraline. But something isn't right about them. Something is definitely wrong with her \\"other mother\\" (as she is referred to). Soon her real parents go missing and Coraline needs to discover the secrets of her other flat so she can find her parents and return to her \\"normal\\" life.<br />As a pretty big Neil Gaiman fan I was a little disappointed in \\"Coraline\\". I just felt the target audience was beneath me. I've read other books of his that was targeted for a younger audience and found them to work for a wide range of audience. Not \\"Coraline\\". The other problem with it isn't Gaiman's fault but it is a result of poor marketing. On the cover of the book there are numerous quotes saying how scary it is and one that says it is one of the scariest books ever. That is just not true.<br />In closing, this book is not horrible. It's probably really good for the \\"below 13\\" crowd. Good one to read to your youngsters.

At first I had wanted to get the individual books, in the same format she had them printed, but it made sense to buy one large book because of the shipping costs (since I live so far away).<br /><br />First off, the book is quite heavy, but this actually works for me, because reading time with my nephews becomes an important event.  One of them gets to retrieve the book with great ceremony, and gather around.  I first thought that the stories might not be to their liking; I was very pleasantly surprised to find that they really enjoy the stories, and the illustrations simply bring the words to life.  If there are words they do not understand, it is easy enough to pause for a moment and explain.  One of the older boys doesn't enjoy reading, but these stories have made him more interested in knowing what will happen next, as Ms. Potter's stories do have a sense of suspense and timing.<br /><br />As an adult reader who never got to read more than just Peter Rabbit's story, the background information of each story was fascinating to me, and this actually made me watch the movie \\"Miss Potter\\" (which I also liked very much).<br /><br />It's no wonder these stories have stood the test of time.  This edition is well worth the price.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I loved this video! I work out 3-4 times a week and still found this video very challenging. It hits every single muscle and then some for a total body workout. And the best part, it's super quick. When you just think you can not possibly lift your arms once more your on to the next thing. It has jumped started my weight loss again, and that is awsome!    The moves are very simple to follow. Unlike alot of videos I have used. I can actually keep up and understand what they are doing. Choose your level, 1, 2, or 3 and get moving. All you need are some hand weights and a soft mat or carpet. Thats it!

Reading the fundamentals and starting a dream journal has taken me from hardly ever remembering a dream to remembering most every night and increasing dream recall extensively!  I can only imagine the results of delving into the practice and working on lucidity.  This book is not a quick fix.  It is based on sound principles requiring concentration and effort on your part.  Guaranteed to be helpful as long as you dedicate time to practice.

B00005JLEU|5.0|\\"You're called Chihiro? That name is too long and hard to pronounce. From now on, you'll be called Sen. You got that? You're Sen.\\" - Yu-Baaba<br /><br />Soon after the family car carrying an insecure little girl moving to a new town is stopped at the end of a mysterious road in the forest, she and her parents are thrown into a world of magic, danger, and tests, and emerges a strong, assertive young lady. Her name is Chihiro, and she is able to accomplish this successful journey to maturity because she does not lose her own identity to the name-stealing witch, Yu-Baaba. Sen evolves into a true heroine because she never loses the memory of her name, Chihiro, even though she is constantly surrounded by strange characters who have long-forgotten their own names and the importance of being who they were intended to become.<br /><br />The newest installment in Studio Ghibli's unparalleled collection of animation movies, \\"Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi\\" (AKA: \\"Spirited Away\\", and \\"Sen or Chihiro in the Land of the Gods\\") accomplishes everything its predecessors did - seamless animation, an engaging story, and a brilliant soundtrack. Spirited Away is a story about a girl who is stuck in a mythical world of gods, ghosts, and witches - Chihiro must overcome adversity and fear in order to save her parents (who have come pigs) and escape the world that has enslaved her. Director Miyazaki Hayao, head of Studio Ghibli, has managed to craft a cinematic masterpiece, one that will doubtless be considered a classic. Spirited Away takes on an extra level of significance, as Miyazaki has announced that it will be his last film. In retrospect, it can be seen that Spirited Away has amalgamated the best elements of previous Ghibli-Miyazaki movies into one spectacular film about a lost little girl named Chihiro. One of these elements is strong character development, which is evident in the character of Chihiro throughout the course of the movie, and becomes the central focus of the movie itself. As the Japanese title suggests, Chihiro undergoes a significant change of character in the movie under the persona of Sen, but she is still able to retain her own identity, unlike the other characters of the story. As Sen, Chihiro is able to bring out the strength and courage that was deep inside her, becoming more independent and accepting of circumstances. In a mythical world that causes people to lose virtue and become greedy, Chihiro is able to remain innocent because she remembers who she was. Through her unclouded perspectives she is able to grow into a courageous, independent, and adaptable individual.<br /><br />The masked ghost is probably the most enigmatic character of the movie, and serves to illuminate Chihiro's shining presence. The ghost is essentially an empty shell - his thoughts and actions are tailored to the desires of those around him. Upon entering the bathhouse, he notices that the sight of gold makes the bathhouse workers squirm in greedy ecstasy, and so he seeks to please them with gifts of gold. By successfully ensnaring the giant frog and eating him, he assumes the shape of a frog, which suggests that the ghost takes on the personality and voice of his prey. The frog was probably eaten first because of its non-humanoid features, to show a physical, and implied mental change, which would not be as obvious when the ghost eats a person. The ghost can never manage to tempt Sen, however. Offering her valuable items such as the bathhouse cards and a handful of gold nuggets, she always politely refuses him. A subtle detail about the ghost is what tells the viewer the environment the bathhouse has - every time that Sen refuses the ghost, the ghost turns increasingly transparent. It is almost as if in order to solidify in the bathhouse, one has to be greedy and desire riches (unless one had eaten the bitter dumpling as her parents did before turning into pigs). This idea of solidification is also shown with the arrival of Zeniiba at the bathhouse, where she cannot assume an opaque state. This is probably due to the virtuous intentions of Zeniiba, Yu-Baaba's older twin sister, who is not driven by greed. Although the two sisters look, dress, and talk the same way, the personalities are wildly different. While Yu-Baaba is the owner of an extravagant bathhouse for the gods, the centerpiece of a festive town, Zeniiba lives by herself in a small, isolated cottage with flowers on the doorframe. While Yu-Baaba's world may be one of forgetfulness and stolen identities, Zeniiba's is one of recovered old memories and a strong sense of self. Chihiro is told to treasure her name, and to be assertive of her identity. The masked ghost is also asked to stay at Zeniiba's house to serve as her assistant - in this peaceful and humble environment, the ghost has nothing but kindness to learn from Zeniiba.<br /><br />Throughout the film, Haku, an intelligent boy who befriends Sen soon after she is left by her parents who have tranformed into gluttonous pigs, unknowlingly guides her back on her strange journey to her former self. When Haku in not outside the bathhouse, he is a tormented flying white dragon, constantly searching for relevance to the reason for his being. Eventually we learn the bond between Sen and Haku, but not before a wild ride through this animated feast for the eyes first.<br /><br />This film may be too intense for little ones as there are scenes of horror, violence, and blood (including bloody vomitus). Young teens will certainly have a level of maturity to be able to see it and ask questions, and hopefully engage in \\"spirited\\" conversation about all things Sen. I've viewed it half a dozen times, and I still get more out of it each time. I'm am certain you will too.t assume an opaque state.

B001ILFUD2|2.0|When you discuss the animated films of the eighties, you may find that films such as \\"An America Tale\\", \\"The Land Before Time\\", and \\"All Dogs Go To Heaven\\" are mentioned before anything From Disney makes it's way into the conversation.  This was not a good decade for Disney until \\"The Little Mermaid\\" floated onto the screen in 1989.  Prior to our introduction to Ariel, the Disney landscape in the eighties was spotted with \\"The Fox and the Hound\\" (1981), \\"The Black Cauldron\\" (1985), \\"The Great Mouse Detective\\" (1986), and \\"Oliver and Company\\" (1988).    On February 3rd 2009, Disney will release \\"Oliver and Company\\" 20th Anniversary Edition on DVD.  With a story based on the classic \\"Oliver Twist\\" by Charles Dickens, an all-star cast featuring Bette Midler, Dom DeLuise, Cheech Marin, Billy Joel, Robert Loggia, Richard Mulligan, Joey Lawrence, and a sound track with songs from Midler, Joel, Huey Lewis, and Ruth Pointer, it is certainly tough to see where this could have gone wrong.  Not that this is a bad film, but it should have been better.    Oliver (Lawrence) is a kitten that is abandoned in New York City circa 1988.  Oliver is reluctantly befriended by Dodger (Joel, who auditioned for the role over the phone) and eventually accepted into the gang of dogs who have run of the city as they attempt to help Fagan (DeLuise) raise money to pay off his debt to the evil Sykes (Voiced masterfully by Loggia).  Oliver fits in with the gang but is eventually adopted by Jenny (Natalie Gregory) before being reluctantly rescued by Dodger and friends, and subsequently kidnapped by Sykes.    The story has some holes, but is generally fun, though the opening sequence of Oliver being abandoned and chased by vicious dogs may be a bit much for young children and turn them off before the film really gets started.    The cast is excellent but Marin steals the show as the other performers are hindered by a lack of character development.    Where this film really struggles is with the animation and music.  In the bonus feature \\"The Making of Oliver and Company\\" the fact that this is the first Disney film to truly embrace the use of computer animation is touted.  Unfortunately the result resembles a Saturday morning cartoon from the late seventies or early eighties.  The background seems flat, and there are inconsistencies in the artwork.      The music does not quite work either.  It had been some time since Disney had made an animated musical, and apparently it was deemed necessary at this point, whether the story supported it or not.  The songs are fine, and certainly performed by top talent, but they just don't seem to fit in the film and are sporadically placed.     Add the flat animation to the forced musical aspect, and it is tough to make it through this seventy-four minute outing without becoming distracted.    There is not a lot of bonus material that wasn't included in the 2002 release, and what is here is weak at best, except for two bonus shorts from Disneys animated library.  Appropriately the two cartoons feature Pluto dealing with cats.  Both are great fun, and actually surpass the main feature in animation and storytelling.    The other bonus features include the previously mentioned \\"The Making of Oliver and Company\\" which is informative and entertaining but insultingly brief.  The kids may enjoy the bonus sing along sections and the \\"Oliver's Big City Challenge Game\\", but Disney could have included all the songs and the game will only appeal to the youngest of viewers. The featurette \\"Disneys Animated Animals\\" is too short and a bit self-serving, but the \\"Oliver and Company Scrapbook\\", \\"Fun Film Facts\\", and Publicity materials are enjoyable to view.    Recommendation: This will appeal to an audience within a select age range.  Not so young as to be disturbed by the emotional opening segment, and not too old to notice how the film fails in comparison to some of Disneys more recent classics.  Adults will certainly appreciate the performance of Marin who gleans a smile with every line, and may enjoy trying to spot the homage to other classic Disney canines and some inconsistencies in the artwork.  There are much worse ways for a family to spend an evening, but other Disney fare might be more fulfilling.
0307454894|5.0|I found this book absolutely amazing. Written in simple short sentences, but used in so clever way that every sentence is important. Schlink managed to create great atmosphere of Germany after the war. I found Hanna very exciting and erotic. I hoped she would get free despite the fact that I despised all about Nazies. However probably everyone would do the same as she did in the wheels of second world war.  Pity that book was short. Anytime I open the book again I must start to read again.
0805083367|4.0|As with the earlier books (Brown Bear, Polar Bear)- great for children who are just starting the reading process. Very predictable and therefore lots of success.
B001DHXT1G|4.0|Now I liked Ang Lee's Hulk and I enjoy this version as well.  To be honest I can't decide between the two, which is a better film.  I believe that both movies stand alone strongly and neither is the right version.  However, this film has a much more broad potential for a franchise or Avengers spinoff.  It was a much more fun approach and definetly more action-based.<br /><br />Ang Lees Hulk, I think survived because of its cast and epic proportion.  What didn't work was the Comic panel frames.  There were few people that appreciated that creation.  The action worked and the story worked, but It was just too much length and emotion for its viewers.<br /><br />What works in this film is its simplicity and comic relief for the audience, as well as performances by Edward Norton and Tim Roth.  Also the creativity in the action sequences was much appreciated.  I think I was drawn more to Connelly's portrayal of Betty rather than Liv Tyler's but I'm happy that no one in this film did a horrible job.  I think the majority would say that the pace and action of this film is way more enjoyable.<br /><br />Our special features do their justice.  I certainly got to see a million behind the scenes episodes, which is good.  The U-Control feature was a little tedious and I hope it's revised in the future releases.  Other than that I was glad to pick up my Blu-Ray version.  This is a great quality delivering Blu-Ray.<br /><br />So I reccomend this film to collectors and viewers alike.  Expect a lot of smashing and crashing and you will not be let down by this film.  Thank you Leterreir for stepping it up.

0061339202|5.0|Besides having more vowels in his name than any other researcher in the field of positive psychology, Mihály Csíkszentmihályi is probably best known for his book \\"Flow\\". So what exactly is flow?    Well, there are short and long ways to define the concept of flow. The short way is to tell you that flow is roughly the equivalent to what most people refer to as being \\"in the zone\\" or \\"in the groove\\". More elaborate definitions might be that it is \\"the state in which people are so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter; the experience itself is so enjoyable that people do it even at great cost, for the sheer state of doing it.\\"     Being such a desirable state, flow is naturally linked to happiness. The book feels that the path to happiness is a circuitous one that begins with one achieving control over the \\"contents of our consciousness\\". I'm taking that to mean that if I learn to find flow experiences, it will lead to greater happiness.     Know from the get-go that \\"Flow\\" is NOT a step-by-step book that gives you tips on how to be happy. Instead, the book summarizes years of research, so what you get when all is said and done, are general principles along with examples of how people have used them to transform their lives. The hope, then, is that you will have enough information in the book to make the transition from principles and theory, to actual practice.     In a nutshell, \\"Flow\\" is a unique and interesting book that examines the process of achieving happiness through the control of one's inner life and is a classic in it's field. Other positive psychology books I liked include \\"Finding Happiness in a Frustrating World\\".
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|this is my all time favorite Jane Austen story, and this movie is true to the original work. Keira Knightley is great as always in period piece. One of the most romantic story that was ever written.
0316017922|5.0|The main point of this book is that to be successful you need a chance in life.  This chance could be given to many more people if our society were to only allow it.  It's a great thought provoking book that has made me think about whether I have helped in giving those around me the chance they deserve.  Great book!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|What can I say?  I'm a Browncoat.  Southeastern division.  Man, I thought FarScape got the shaft until I found out about what the networks did to Firefly!!!!!  What are these jerks thinking about?  40,000 people at Dragon Con all trying to see Nathan & Alan at once!  I mean, really.    Firefly is such a wonderful show, great actors who have a good comraderie - I cry to think what Joss could have done with this show over a seven year span - over a 2 year span for crying out loud.  At least we got Serenity & the graphic novels.  So get the series & meet these big damn heroes.  You'll not regret it.  Oh, & forget about best CANCELLED TV shows.  Try BEST TV SHOWS EVER.

B000OCXMAE|5.0|I've wanted to get Linkin Park's albums before - I love the melodic metal - but stopped short because rap's just not for me. There's just two songs on this album with rap, and one of those (Bleed it Out) has a great chorus. This is one of those rare albums where I'm entranced and resonating with nearly all the tracks. I got it from the library to check it out, thinking maybe I'd just pick a couple for mp3 download, but now I just had to buy the whole thing. I've even getting to like the rap part of Bleed it Out :-)

0393327655|4.0|This book read more as a primer for the subject of faith as a weapon. It covered the dangers related to faith directed education and revolved primarily around the extremist muslim faith and the impact that sectarian dogmatism plays when allowed to expand unchecked. There was great emphasis to keep the focus not far from the risks inherent in government regulated faith as well as the issues surrounding the schism in the US with regards to the political and theistic \\"wedge\\" being driven into the US society by potentially dangerous extremist dogmatic fanatics.

B000JLPMPS|4.0|UNFORGIVEN<br /><br />**** Out of 5<br /><br />Release Date- August 7th, 1992<br /><br />Running Time- 131-Minutes<br /><br />Rating- R<br /><br />Screenplay- David Webb Peoples<br /><br />Director- Clint Eastwood<br /><br />Starring- Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, Richard Harris, Frances Fisher, Jaimz Woolvett, Saul Rubinek, Anna Levine and Gene Hackman as Little Bill Daggett<br /><br />Unforgiven was Clint Eastwood's big return to the Western genre and is by considered by many as one of the all time greats of the genre and won four Academy Awards, which included best editing for Joel Cox, Gene Hackman for best supporting actor, best director for Eastwood and best picture and while Unforgiven is deserving of it's praise the movie isn't without it's flaws and quite honestly as much as I liked the movie it wouldn't make my top 5 Eastwood movies.<br /><br />The screenplay by David Webb Peoples is quite solid with some really great characters. Unforgiven does feature plenty of action, but the movie is driven more by the characters rather than the action. The characters are all mostly well written for, but some aren't as interesting as others. None of the characters are boring or anything, but some work better than others. The script is well thought out and works on pretty much every level<br /><br />Clint Eastwood won his first Oscar for Unforgiven and he delivers a very well made movie. As I stated even with the action, Unforgiven is much more driven by the characters and Eastwood does a great job at brining the script to life. His scenes are generally well paced and he delivers some great action, suspense and real life human emotions. The only problem I really had was the running time. I personally felt the 134-minute running time was a little overly long. While none of the scenes are filler scenes and they all add to the plot and to the characters I did feel a few minutes here and there could have been edited out and it wouldn't hurt the movie at all.<br /><br />But regardless Eastwood delivers an excellent movie and the final act was nothing short of brilliant. The suspense level is excellent and while the shoot outs don't drag out, but they aren't too brief either and while the whole movie was well done I think the final act is where Eastwood really shines as director.<br /><br />Besides directing and producing Clint Eastwood stars as William Munny and this might be the best character Eastwood has ever played or at least the most complex. The thing about Eastwood is he is a great actor in the sense that he's best known for that tough guy role and even in his lighter movies he still has that tough guy persona and you'll be hard pressed to find someone better at that role than Eastwood, but he doesn't have a lot of range as an actor. That isn't a knock against him since he's great at what he does, but in Unforgiven, Clint Eastwood shows more range than anything before or after this movie.<br /><br />William Munny was a cold blooded killer who once married changed his ways and is seeking a sort of redemption. He knows what he's done in the past and he knows it was wrong, but what's done is done and in many ways William Munny is a broken man since the death of his wife. William Munny may not be as cool and entertaining as say Dirty Harry, but like I said he is the most complex of all Eastwood's characters. There was a lot of depth to William Munny and Eastwood really delivers a performance of a lifetime. We've seen characters like this before, but Eastwood as director and actor manages to make it seem fresh and different. Clint was nominated for best actor, but lost out to Al Pacino for Scent of a Woman, but I personally feel of all the nominated actors that year Eastwood was by far the best with a very complex character.<br /><br />The supporting cast is excellent with Morgan Freeman as Ned Logan, who like Munny has done bad things in the past and is trying to put it behind him. Gene Hackman like always is great and was very deserving of his Oscar win, but I don't understand how Freeman wasn't nominated.

I read this book for the first time years ago and read it again recently.  I was just as blown away as I remember being the first time.  I truly love this book.  Paulo Coelho is one of the most talented story tellers in the world.
B000FS9MV0|5.0|I just have to say that this album was one of the best I have heard in a very long time. It's simply stunning that this is an eighteen year old that is okay with singing songs of substance rather than be wearing tight, sleazy clothes and singing about sex and boys like her counterparts. I am a 25 year old who used to love the pop scene (Paris Hilton, Girlicious, etc.) but have found solace in other genre's like classical, jazz, and thanks to this album, will now be listening to more swing. I caught her self titled album as well and was captivated by the range and emotion in her voice at such a young age. This album and the previous will be on repeat on my MP3 player and I cannot wait for a third album. Talent like this must never stop because this is all we have left in an otherwise talentless society nowadays. Just a note to Renee: No matter who criticizes you never sell out; continue to release great remakes and originals and set the tone for others. You don't have to catch up to them, they have to discover you!

B00005JPUN|3.0|*Invasion* is one of those movies that you're not sure if it's good but you have to watch it all the way to see if it was good or not.  And...usually, you'll realize, in those types of movies, they're usually not good.  But *Invasion* was actually not bad.<br /><br />Nicole Kidman plays a psychiatrist, Carol Bennell, who starts to suspect something's wrong with people.  At first, she's doubtful because her patients claim that their loved ones are imposters.  Little by little, she starts to think that maybe there's a ring of truth from her patients.<br /><br />With the help of her friend and current love interest, Dr. Ben Driscoll (Craig) discover that there are alien spores that attack the brain during REM sleep.  So, the trick is...not to sleep (Freddy Krueger, anyone?).  Pretty soon, it seems that everyone is infected.  These spores are contagious through contact, which is usually through vomiting or spitting.<br /><br />Predictably, Carol gets infected.  But before she completely \\"loses it\\", she is determined to save her son, whom she believes is either immune or has the cure (28 Days Later, anyone?).  In order to save him, she has to deliver him to a safe base.  The problem is there a horde of the infected coming after them.<br /><br />The story slowly builds but once the action starts, it's nailbiting.  Therefore, *Invasion* is worth watching.

B001DHXT20|3.0|I was never a fan of Hulk.  The TV series used to scare the daylights outta me as Bruce Banner was morphing into the Hulk.  (And people wonder why I love Wonder Woman.)  Ang Lee's Hulk in 2003 was a huge disappointment!  Those comic book panels didn't sit well with me and the CGI was laughable.<br /><br />I was hesitant as I saw this movie.  Hmmm...not bad.  The storyline continues from 2003.  Banner is in hiding, somewhere in South America, and is working in a factory.  Meanwhile, he has been emailing with someone in search of a treatment for his exposure to gamma radiation.  This contact, we only know him as Mr. Blue.<br /><br />General Ross, with help, discovers Banner's hiding place and sends a team, headed by Emil Blonsky to capture him.  Of course, Banner, as Hulk, is unstoppable and is able to get away.  After this escape, as Banner, he reunites with Betty Ross.<br /><br />Not one to be discouraged, Blonsky continues his search.  However, Ross tells Blonsky about a special serum that could give him super soldier strength.  Blonsky asks for the injection and his next confrontation with the Hulk becomes interesting.<br /><br />In search for answers, Banner and Betty finally meet Mr. Blue, who is really a research professor, Dr. Sam Sterns.  Sterns is able to synthesize an antidote.  However, Banner and Betty disagree with Sterns' mission for the antidote and persuade Stern to destroy the supply.  Unexpectedly, Blonsky arrives and forces Stern to inject him with this antidote.  Of course, things go wrong and Blonsky becomes Abomination, who seems to be much bigger than Hulk.<br /><br />And it's the fight of all fights.<br /><br />The storyplot...ok.  Special effects...ok.  I just get bored with these angry men/creatures fighting like primitives.<br /><br />P.S. - At the end, you'll see Tony Stark (aka Ironman) approaching General Ross about assembling a team.  If you're current with Hollywood gossips and news, The Avengers is next (slated for 2011).  However, not before Ironman 2 and a Wolverine movie.  Apparently, Spider-Man, Ironman, Hulk and Wolverine will be the Avengers.  (I'm already disappointed with the team lineup.  No Thor?  No Spiderwoman?  No Black Widow?  No Hawkeye?  No She-Hulk?

B000KKPN5C|4.0|Nikon has done a good job in positioning their newest flash units, which is to say that the SB-400 offers enough to make it a good choice for many people, while the SB-600 offers enough more to make it a better choice for others.  Which one is right for you?  Like everything, it depends.    I chose the SB-400 and probably keep it on-camera about half the time.  Indoors the option to bounce the flash off the ceiling makes all the difference in the world, and I would almost never use the on-camera flash for indoor shots.  Either bounce the flash, or use available light without flash, to get good photos of people.  Outdoors, using the SB-400 for fill flash greatly improves pictures of people and many other objects being photographed at close range.  The on-camera flash can be used for this too, but using the SB-400 gives much faster recharge times and more power, and is easier on the camera's battery.  It is especially useful when you will fire a burst of several shots in quick succession, as the on-camera flash will not keep up.  The SB-400 will usually give you several good clean flash shots without having to pause between them.  For all these reasons I usually keep the SB-400 on the camera if I am planning to use flash for even some of my shots.    Unfortunately the SB-400 lacks a couple of fairly important features.  Since the flash head only rotates vertically, it can be difficult or impossible to use bounce flash for vertical shots - you have to bounce the flash off a wall, which might not be conveniently located and might not be white.  That minor inflexibility alone will be enough reason for some people to spend extra for the SB-600.  The SB-400 does not work with Nikon's high-speed \\"FP\\" flash sync mode, which is important for outdoor photography because it means that you can not use a sufficiently high shutter speed to get narrow depths of field in portrait and other shots in good light: a true disappointment.  Finally, the SB-600 offers much more control flexibility, including the ability to adjust flash exposure compensation right on the flash itself.  This is important because it adds to the camera's flash compensation adjustment range - there are circumstances in which the +1 EV maximum flash compensation of my D90 is not enough, and since everything is controlled automatically Through The Lens (TTL), there is no way to over-ride this other than killing TTL control altogether and switching flash control to manual.    There are of course other features that the SB-400 lacks, but these are the three that have actually gotten in the way of ordinary photography for me at times, and the three that have made me think twice about whether I should have gotten the SB-600 instead.  An SB-600 is now on my long-term mental wish list.  Fortunately the SB-400 performs quite admirably most of the time, and it is a nicely designed unit.  It is fairly small, very light thanks partly to the fact that it uses two instead of four AA batteries, and it does its job unobtrusively.  With just a few added key features it would be perfect.    My advice is to think carefully about the trade-offs and consider the SB-600 instead if you think you will use some of the features I've mentioned.  Considering the total cost of the camera/lens/flash system, it might be well worth the extra $75 or so to avoid missing some of those shots that the SB-400 isn't suited to helping with.  For anybody looking for an easy-to-use flash, and who perhaps isn't familiar with the concepts of bounce and fill, I'd recommend learning a little bit about them, as they will let you very easily make almost EVERY shot better.

B0001LJC2K|5.0|I discovered Muse recently after watching the movie Twilight and finding Stephanie Meyers' music playlists on her website that she used to inspire her writing. I immediately knew that I had to buy not only this album but also Black Holes and Revelations. This is the type of music that I only dream about and comes along so rarely that I can not absorb it fast enough. I feel like I can't concentrate on anything else because I am so completely held and entranced by the genius of the music. I am a big fan of U2, Coldplay, Radiohead somewhat, and Muse reminds me of Coldplay somewhat because they mix in the piano and classical elements that Coldplay sometimes does, but to me, the vocal and instrumental range of Muse far surpasses that of Coldplay. I don't understand how this group has remained hidden from me for so long and I am angry that I haven't discovered them earlier, but now that I have I am trying really hard not to blow my ears out while listening to them at work b/c I am just amazed.
B000V86OKG|5.0|Season two of a show that is **not for everyone** comes back stronger and slicker than ever. Dexter Morgan is the nicest serial killer on the block, eating his favorite Cuban sandwiches, bowling with his colleagues, spending time with his lovely girlfriend and her adorable kids.... and dismembering evil doers.     Season two is stronger, funnier, and more thought-provoking than the first. Dexter is struggling to maintain his cover with his co-worker Seargent Doakes tailing him constantly.     His homelife gets complicated when girlfriend Rita, sure that Dexter is hiding something, is convinced that Dexter is a drug addict. In rehab Dexter meets the darkly volatile Lila who just might see the real Dexter.     Things get even worse when his body stash is discovered and Dexter himself is drawn into Miami Metro's investigation of the \\"Bay Harbor Butcher\\". With fantastic acting and writing, Dexter continues to be one of the most addicting and exciting shows on TV.
B0011Z77Q8|5.0|Like a man and women who look into each other's eyes for the first time and know that they have found true love, Muse hits you straight in the heart and never lets you go. Once you have picked up your dropped jaw after hearing Take a Bow for the first time, you can take a second to realize that you have found the pot of gold on the other side of the rainbow; that you have found the Emerald Castle at the end of the yellow brick road. You realize that you have found something so special that you wonder if you are dreaming because you can't believe that you are only now discovering Muse. You find it so hard to believe that something so amazing could have eluded you for so long.     Webster's defines muse as to become absorbed in thought. Well, Muse will certainly make you wonder. They will make you think and realize how fortunate we are to have such an amazing group of musicians that are Muse.

I recommend this book to all couples, whether they are having issues in their relationship or not. Your relationship can be saved or improved once you start speaking the same 'language'.
0684803356|5.0|I have an original copy of For Whom the Bell Tolls that my grandfather gave me.  For years I read the poem at the beginning of the book, (which has the same title as the book itself) but had never read the content.  It is amazing that after years of reflecting on that poem, that reading the actual content of this classic meant so much more. As I am sure was Hemingway's intention, you can literraly reflect on that poem back through every single chapter in the book, and each time the poem will have a new meaning for the reader.  This is a true sign, in my opinion, of a great author.  I need to read this novel again, to pick up on some of the hidden inuendos and nuances I might have missed the first time, but that too will be time well-spent.    This is a phenomenal book, by a bona fide, talented classic author.  It is worth reading, reflecting upon, and reading again.

I am addicted to this show and can't wait for the 3rd season to begin! If you have never watched Dexter, then purchase the 1st season and I will bet you that you will come back to order the 2nd season before HBO begins the 3rd. The DVD is great because you can watch one episode after another when originally we had to wait an entire week to see the next episode.

B001L5SXQG|5.0|A few days ago, my wife told me that she heard a radio d.j. promoting his upcoming program, called `Is Springsteen over-rated?' I couldn't help but think that this d.j. was hopelessly uninformed and out of touch. Nearly forty years into his career, and Bruce Springsteen still needs to suffer fools like this? From his very first album, he had to deflect the `next Dylan' hype, then the simultaneous Newsweek and Time magazine covers, while naysayers wondered if he deserved it. In later years, fans bemoaned that he `lost it' simply because he refused to rewrite (fill in your favorite Springsteen song here). If nothing else, Bruce has been tenacious, and reasonably consistent as a songwriter. Few people know their way around populist ideals as well as Springsteen does, and maybe that is exactly why there will always be someone who resents his innate ability to reach into the heart of a crowd.<br />\\"Working On a Dream\\" will give the skeptical plenty to squawk about. It is also one of Springsteen's most interesting albums. Superficially, it is easy to criticize much of the material. \\"Queen of the Supermarket\\" sounds like a near-mindless concept, while \\"Outlaw Pete\\" is so deceptively dumb that it could start a bar fight. Since it is also the opening track, it is virtually impossible to ignore, as he sings, \\"He robbed a bank in his diapers and little bare baby feet, all he said was \\"Folks my name is Outlaw Pete.\\" A more auspicious beginning to a major album would be hard to imagine. As the song unfolds, it grows in grandeur until it becomes cinematic in scope, but doubters will remain perplexed, or even dumbfounded. Cinematic? \\"Screen door slams. Mary's dress sways. Like a vision she dances...\\" That is cinematic. \\"I'm Outlaw Pete, can you hear me?\\" Puh-lease. \\"Thunder Road\\" is widescreen, surround sound huge. Comparably, \\"Outlaw Pete\\" is a kinescope. So, I understand why people will criticize and nitpick at this song, but they ought to stop and think that Springsteen wrote it, fully aware of his own catalog, and that there is something playful and ironic at work here. He knows what the expectations are, and by leading off with this track, he deflects pre-formed opinions, and subsequently, the album proves itself to be as rich in imagery and melody as anything he has ever done.<br />For starters, \\"Working on a Dream\\" is much less dense than 2007's\\"Magic,\\" allowing the instruments to breathe. There is spaciousness where there previously had been claustrophobia. Perhaps the difference is political in its essence - \\"Magic\\" captured Springsteen's impression of the Bush years, while \\"Working on a Dream\\" portrays a cautious optimism, as implied by the title track and \\"My Lucky Day.\\" Springsteen is undoubtedly in love, and he is fully capable of tapping into that vein for rich material that expresses the joy of living in the moment. On \\"This Life,\\" he unabashedly expresses that thought, singing \\"A bang then stardust in your eyes, a billion years or just this night, either way it'll be all right,\\" while the gorgeous arrangement suggests Brian Wilson at his finest. \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" (not the Beatles song, but a beautiful country rocker with strings), and \\"Life Itself\\" further develop this theme, and it reaches its apotheosis on \\"Kingdom of Days,\\" where he sings, \\"I count my blessings that you're mine for always. We laugh beneath the covers and count the wrinkles and the grays...this is our kingdom of days.\\"<br />\\"Working on a Dream\\" is an album you could grow old with, but listeners need to let its beauty reveal itself. If you're a Springsteen fan, you might as well brace yourself for the usual uninformed negativity that often accompanies his latter-day work. Some people will hear a song or two, then toss off \\"Working on a Dream\\" by saying that he lost it, or some such thing. The truth, though, is exactly opposite that. The album demands you to listen beneath the surface, and if you are willing to try, the pay off is extraordinary. Some time in the future, \\"Working On a Dream\\" is destined to reveal itself as a masterpiece, one of Springsteen's finest albums, but meanwhile, the debate is sure to rage on. Loudmouths and ignorant d.j.'s will continue to spew nonsense, but I'll drown them out by listening to \\"Working on a Dream.\\"  A  Tom Ryanfuture, \\"Working On a Dream\\" is destined to reveal itself as a masterpiece, one of Springsteen's finest albums, but meanwhile, the debate is sure to rage on.

B001LF4IA6|4.0|Bruce's new album Working on a Dream is fine. THE ONLY THING I DISLIKE IS the artificial production of it, THAT ARTIFICIAL ALMOST ELECTRONIC SOUND on most of its songs (btw it's the same with most of Magic songs). I always have no expectations on Bruce's coming album. I just let him reveal what he wants to reveal in the way he likes it. Simply said \\"do what YOU WANT in the way YOU FEEL it.\\" This is the reason why do I love Nebraska so much, Tom Joad so much, We Shall Overcome, The Wild & The Innocent and every of his folk songs and every concert I've been to, just because I can hear the melody, that tune coming from the very ground through his open heart and straight into the universe. The sound is purely natural, I can clearly hear the strings of his guitar, his howling harmonica and every bit of tones his pals release to support him. Therefore my highlights on this album are Tomorrow Never Knows, The Last Carnival and The Wrestler, of course.

B00005RDRO|4.0|Is this movie a comedy for mystery fans, or a mystery for comedy fans?  Whatever your tastes, this is a delightful spoof of the old gumshoe classics of the thirties and forties. Poirot, Marple, Chan, Spade, and the Charles' (Thin Man series) are all lampooned by a (pardon my caps) ALL-STAR CAST that is amazing by any standard.  It's hard to say which performer was having the most fun.  I'd give it five stars, but I recognize that the subject may have limited appeal for younger audiences who would have a hard time anchoring the farcical characters to their famous literary forebears.  The writing is a hoot with many laugh-out-loud moments, but I think I enjoy it more because I appreciate the satire and not just the sight gags.  Honestly, I put this one on my short list of lesser-known gems.  How wonderful that it's still available for purchase.<br /><br />The plot centers around a dinner party hosted by an eccentric (aren't they all) mystery host who plans stage a murder so that he can outsmart the world's greatest detectives.  The guest list includes (in alphabetical order) Eileen Brennan (Tess Skeffington), Truman Capote (Lionel Twain), James Coco (Milo Perrier), James Cromwell (Marcel), Peter Falk (Sam Diamond), Alec Guinness (Bensonmum), Elsa Lanchester (Jessica Marbles),  Richard Narita (Willie Wang), David Niven (Dick Charleston), Peter Sellers (Sidney Wang), Maggie Smith (Dora Charleston), Nancy Walker (Maid), and Estelle Winwood (Nurse).  How could you not be delighted by such a cast?<br /><br />If you liked Clue, the film version of the famous board game you'll probably find Murder By Death somewhat familiar, but every bit as enjoyable.

None of his most famous songs are on this album including domino, into the mystic, moondance, brown eyed girl and so forth. The way this album flows is just unreal.

I next found myself wanting to just turn it off and do something useful but again since the rating was good I had to continue to see the end.<br /><br />If you want to watch a guy run around just taking pictures all of the time then this is for you. This had to have been the worst 2 hours and $15 I have ever spent in my life......do not buy or watch this movie.

Many of the detractors have given this book a low rating due to the fact that some of the findings are not new.  For the semi-illiterate such as me - that's OK.  I haven't read the other books referred to so I found Outliers FASCINATING!  I knew that the kids of my Asian friends were better at math than my kids - I just never knew why.  I thought Bill Gates was just lucky as well as smart.  I didn't know he'd paid his dues, and paid and paid and paid.  I'd heard about all the rich old guys of the 1800's but didn't see any commonality until Gladwell pointed out their birth years.  Maybe Outliners is not the most innovative, or the first, or the most literary look at the story of success but it's still a darn good read.....bg

In my opinion, one of the greatest vocal albums of all time.     I had the good fortune to hear Shirley twice, and we are so fortunate that she left such a great legacy.  One of the more interesting facts about Shirley is that she didn't have widespread success until relatively late in life - such an inspiration to all women in jazz!

B0019M06JS|4.0|The first time through, I wasn't sure I would love this album the way I have some of Eliane's earlier works.  The string arrangements, while beautiful and tasteful, may make this CD have slightly more commercial appeal, perhaps similar to Diana Krall and, with this release, Eliane may attract a wider audience.  That said, Elias' skills in interpretation of bossa nova, are among the best of any living artist, and I hope the CD will lead more people to discover that the spirit of bossa nova can show itself in music as far-flung as a Stevie Wonder song and a Johnny Mercer song.  If you are just discovering Eliane, be sure to listen to [[ASIN:B000005HFJ Eliane Elias Plays Jobim]]    The beautiful Ivan Lins tune \\"I'm Not Alone (Who Loves You)\\" is my favorite one on this CD. A strong second is the beautiful \\"Estate\\" written by an Italian composer and sung in Italian (and often mistakenly thought to be Brazilian in origin.) For my favorite English version of Estate, see the Shirley Horn album [[ASIN:B0000046KM Here's to Life]]

0307269191|4.0|Murakami is a well know, quirky writer who has authored a number of novels and has a cult following. Although he is Japanese, and writes primarily in Japanese, his English is good enough that he also translates (professionally?) between the two languages.<br /><br />Murakami is also a runner. While his times are only pretty good, e.g., a marathon in about 3:30, he has been at it for 25 or so years, and he has true runner's view of running, if that makes sense. I can say this because I have been running for about 35 years and, although my times are a bit faster than his, I can see that Murakami is clearly one of \\"us\\" -- those people to whom running comes naturally. Not that he is fast, just that it is natural for him to run.<br /><br />This book offers Murakami's personal take on running, as well as writing. If you are a fan of his writing, then this book will be a must-read. Even if you do not care one whit about his novels, however, this book offers a good view into the mind of those of us for whom running is a calling of sorts, a natural part of our lives.

B000X5SPBI|5.0|Supernatural once again raises the bar, and season three pushes the show to its limits.  Even though the season is relativley short at 16 episodes because of the writer's strike, it doesnt cease to dazzle you.  It picks up right where last season leaves off, and ends with a finale that you never see coming.  Worth every penny.  Even comes with a digital copy of it, so you can go to itunes, download it, and put it on your ipod.  A must buy!

1423113497|5.0|These books are meant for young readers but i found them very enjoyable though i am in my twenties. i laughed out loud many times during these books(especially the second) and i would highly recommend them. The books have loveable characters whom i cared about and a plot that kept my interest and will make you smile. The story centers around a 12 year-old boy named Percy. Percy has been kicked out of a handful of boarding school for bad behavior, till one day during a field trip his teacher transforms into a demonic winged creature and he kills her with a ball point pen that shifts into a full lengthed sword. Yeah pretty crazy, right? imagine how surprised he was. from there the story takes off and its fun throughout. great read for all ages!
B001P5HI4A|4.0|The 25th Anniversary Edition DVD of Barbra Streisand's 1983 directorial debut is here at last, and it is chock full of bonus features. Highlights include a new introduction by Streisand, a commentary track from her as well as the film's executive producer Rusty Lemorande, and most intriguingly, eleven deleted scenes. As the first of only three films she has directed (so far), Streisand's labor of love still holds up as a charming turn-of-the-last-century fable that blends a contemporary sense of its three principal characters with an elaborately orchestrated soundtrack.<br /><br />The movie plays out very much like the way she uniquely sings a song - beautifully lush, emotionally intimate and a bit overdone albeit forgivably so. Regardless, what makes this film genuinely successful is the heartfelt manner in which Streisand chooses to tell her version of Isaac Bashevis Singer's short story, [[ASIN:B001JTUX76 Yentl the Yeshiva Boy]]. Co-written by her and English playwright Jack Rosenthal, the plot focuses on a young Jewish woman in Eastern Europe who has been tutored on the Talmud by her scholarly father. Since women are forbidden to receive a formal education, it remains a clandestine vocation until her father dies at which point she cuts off her hair, dresses like a boy, and seeks passage to the nearest Talmudic academy. En route, under the guise of Anshel, she meets Avigdor with whom she falls in love. Complications ensue since Yentl cannot reveal her true identity to Avigdor, who is in love with the comely Hadass, but Hadass becomes attracted to Anshel through the machinations of Avigdor when he is forbidden by Hadass' father to marry her.<br /><br />Streisand directs this romantic roundelay with warmth and sincerity rather than cheap laughs, and naturally, as a means to bridge her dramatic interpretations of the big ballads penned by Michel Legrand and her favorite lyricists, Alan & Marilyn Bergman. The songs reflect interior monologues to express how Yentl feels in any given situation, and the conjoining technique works beautifully since the songs are so well crafted and Streisand is in glorious, emotionally unfettered voice. The best are the solitarily prayerful [[ASIN:B00137R94Y Papa Can You Hear Me?]] under a starry night sky, the lusciously unrequited passion driving [[ASIN:B00137Z2U2 The Way He Makes Me Feel]], and the triumphant declaration of [[ASIN:B00137TD4S No Matter What Happens]]. As expected from as meticulous a novice filmmaker as Streisand, the production values are superior, especially David Watkin's burnished cinematography and Roy Walker's production design.<br /><br />In truth, Streisand looks too old as Yentl the yearning woman, but in full drag as Anshel, she looks ideally boyish. As she traverses genders back and forth with a fumbling grace, it is probably the most subtle acting she has done in films. Mandy Patinkin, then more famous as a singing Ch&eacute; Guevara in [[ASIN:B000002ORP Evita]], makes for a potent romantic lead bringing a surly intellect and smoldering passion to Avigdor. As the third corner in the triangle, Amy Irving convincingly plays the subservient bride-to-be with sly intelligence. Veteran character actor Nehemiah Persoff ([[ASIN:B000FIHNAC Some Like It Hot]]) makes his few poignant scenes count as Yentl's father. A bit overlong at 132 minutes, it isn't a perfect film but it remains an impressive directorial debut and the first film that validates Streisand's exalted standing as a multi-hyphenate entertainment figure.situation, and the conjoining technique works beautifully since the songs are so well crafted and Streisand is in glorious, emotionally unfettered voice.

B00005JLKB|3.0|lately I've checking out alot of shows similar to this such as Roswell, Charmed, Supernatural and I used to be a huge Buffy/Angel fan and Dark Angel and Tru Calling! so I'm familiar with plots that involve a superhero that has to hide the fact that he has powers that are unusual.     in this case.. I have yet to finish the season but there are pluses to this show.. Lex Luther is the big one! his character is the most intruiging because you know he will become a nemises to Clarke but the question for me anywayz.. is how? how does he become a darker character then he is atm? and Michael Rausenbaum has def lived up to the challenge of playing this role of a very conflicted character!    Clarke Kent has struggles of his own. he wants to be with Lana but he doesn't want any enemies so he's letting Whitney stay with her as he really needs her atm. now as for Tom Welling.. gets the title role thx to his gorgeous body. his acting abilities are extremely limited.     the parents have very limited acting abilities. and never really fully commit to their roles. we believe their good people and they have good intentions but the way they convey their emotions is not gonna win them any oscars. there's no passion in it.    Lana Lang.. well I'm waiting for her character to develop a little more. she's not that interesting yet. but Kristin Kreuk shows she can change it up a little. I think she's better when she's got attitude! this whole good girl image is not her strength acting wise. tho she's far better an actor then Tom Welling at any rate. but that's not saying much.    the best actor of the younger cast.. is by far Allison Mack who has similar traits to Lana only she conveys them in a much more synthetic matter! I believe she has the best intentions and has definitely commited to her role!    the plot is episode by episode basis.. the villains are one dimensional and uninterested and sometimes just plain weird. I guess this show gets more interesting as it goes on.    I'm mostly watching this cause James Marsters comes in later on in the 5th season and I don't wanna jump in halfway thru. and Lex Luther is interesting enough to keep me going from episode to episode! and the episodes are interesting but just bizarre and the lack of passion from the actors(with 2 exceptions) takes away the great potential this show has.    those are just my thoughts. I appreciate any comments! it might get better the more I watch it.. and maybe the acting gets better. i'm not sure. I'm just commenting on what I've seen. and the father did have one good episode where he shows some attitude! and he quite commits to his role! I know they all have the potential to be good actors but their not quite there yet.

015206396X|3.0|Katsa is a \\"Graceling\\", one of a few who are born with an un-natural skill in something.  It could be anything from cooking, mind reading or, as in Katsa's case, a natural born killing machine.  Gracelings are rare and treated with suspicion and Katsa has become a kind of enforcer for her uncle, the king of one of a number of small kingdoms.<br />An interesting premise and this is a fast paced and easy to read book.  There is light romance but not too much to put me, a middle aged male, off and although I have read that this might be aimed at `young adults', I am not so sure, it felt light standard light fantasy to me.<br />There are a few themes explored here, not least the Graceling element.  We have Katsa's `council' a body trying to do good (Didn't Raymond Feist do this as well?), a woman starting to stand up for herself and a mystery that needs solving.  Add in some interesting support characters and this ends up working quite well.  Certainly a book that makes you want to read `just one more chapter' - I finished it over a weekend.<br />3.5 stars for me!

B000IJ79WU|1.0|Richard Donner is a good director.  He did a fantastic job with the first Superman film.  However, what we see here of his work on Superman II, the parts that are not in the version of Superman II that we already know, these scenes aren't just bad.  They are TERRIBLE.  Some of the scenes are so incredibly bad - Lois' first test of Clark to see if he is Superman - throwing herself off the 56th floor of the Daily Planet?  That's ridiculous.  At least in the other version, when she throws herself in the river, there is a chance she could swim and safe herself.  But she cannot save herself from a fall out of a skyscraper.  And the way that she figures it out?  With a black marker?  That so stupid.    Then, when she finally proves it by calmly shooting the man in the chest with the gun she just so happen to bring with her on this Niagara trip - I just got mad.  Why would she, if there was a slight possibility that he might merely be human and she would have killed him... to say that the character of Lois would have risked another person's life just to prove a point makes her unlikeable.  They really missed the boat with this.      Richard Lester's version digs into the development of the relationship of Clark and Lois so well.  That does not exist in the Richard Donner version.  There are so many terrible edits, that the movie seems so very incomplete.  The ending itself is perhaps the biggest disappointment of all.  Why would he use the EXACT same device used in the first film?  Even if it were just for the purpose of having a different ending from the Lester version, it is a tremendous disappointment.    If you love Superman II, skip this version all together.  It will only upset you.

B0013FXWU6|5.0|\\"There Will Be Blood\\" is an excellent example of what a director can do when he grafts together epic literary tales (\\"King Lear\\", \\"Oedipus Rex\\") and compacts them into one tragic tale.  Paul Thomas Anderson must have had a lot of fun (maybe) skimming the proverbial froth from innumerable tales of the tragic \\"great\\" man and transforming them into this tour de force of tragedy.<br /><br />Daniel Day-Lewis deserves an award for his performance as this hollow, ambitious and sadistic man who arrives on the scene with no origin.  He doesn't talk; he growls.  He doesn't walk; ravages the land he walks on with a proud aggression.  He wants money and he wants oil.<br /><br />This brings him into conflict with perhaps the most despicable character in the film (yes, more despicable than Plainview): the Preacher Eli.  A narcissistic, money hungry con artist who even physically resembles a snake, his heart does not reside in Logos or Divine Truth but in money.  One thing I did not like about this film at all was the constant mockery of the mere idea of God's existence--because there's one fraud playing a huge part in the film, Anderson has to engage in cliched Starbucks cinematic modernity?  (Which is one of the reasons \\"No Country For Old Men\\" is a better film: it is not about the madness of one titanic figure, it is about fate and the ultimate).<br /><br />Plainview, for all his considerable business skills, is essentially a demented and angry misanthrope.  I'd disagree with reviewers (Roger Ebert being one of them) who saw no mercy in this guy.  He seems to care very much for his son H.W. until the end, until all the betrayals real and imagined have occured.  I had to laugh a few times when Plainview flips out, at one point telling a member of Standard Oil that he was going to \\"visit him at his home and cut his throat in the middle of the night\\": all the guy did was suggest that, as a millionaire, he could devote more of his time to his son.  His spontaneous convulsions of rage are both amusing and horrifying.<br /><br />I expected something to change in Plainview's fate midway through the movie for some reason.  It never did.  Things get worse and worse until he is finally worse off, even, than Charles Foster Kane.  And more dangerous.<br /><br />A finely crafted movie.  Definitely destined to become a cult classic.d horrifying.    I expected something to change in Plainview's fate midway through the movie for some reason.  It never did.

B0000025DV|5.0|It was 1978 I was 8 years old and I was at the San Jose Public Library looking at record albums to check out.  I came across this facinating looking spaceship on the cover of a double-album and that was the one I wanted.  I had already seen Star Wars and Close Encounters so spaceships to me were really cool.  My parents had just bought a hi-fi with stereo headphones so I laid back and listened to this record in amazement.  Still to this day I cannot explain how, but I've been hooked on this album and this band since that day.  I even bought a full size poster of the cover for my wall in my bedroom, wish I still had it!  I since bought it on cassette tape, and it was the first CD I ever bought in 1987.  From start to finish it is a sonic buffet with everything to offer.
B00006RYIQ|5.0|Of all the members of the legendary sixties group \\"The Byrds\\" Gene Clark should probably be remembered as the most fully realized artist in the sense that he really had a personal vision of where he wanted his music to go and looking back I think he accomplished what he was going for.Not that Roger Mcguinn,Chris Hillman,David Crosby,and Michael Clarke did not have their post Byrd moment's.It just seems like for the most part the other members of the band were most effective when playing with other artist's;sort of more like a \\"Communal Vision\\" type of band.(\\"Flying Burrito Bros.\\",\\"Crosby,Stills,Nash,and Young\\",\\"Souther,Furay,Hillman\\") Don't get me wrong,I love all those groups as well,but it seem's like Gene Clark was the only member of \\"The Byrds\\" who had the ability to make whole album's of ALL GOOD SONG'S without another notable artist's input.Sadly that ability does not always ensure a \\"Successful\\" solo recording career.Whether or not you like \\"The Byrds\\" or not this album's brilliance might surprise you.Usually when I listen to deep meaningful music it takes me at least a few listen's before it really grows on me.This album took me one listen and I was hooked.It is hard to break it down song by song because of how well it works as a whole album.\\"The True One\\" always seem's to stand out for me both for it's lyrics and melody.\\"But what's been flying must one day touch the ground\\"-Who can't relate to that?That about sums up my entire life in one sentence.(Sad,right lol)This album is a masterpiece and the only one word I can use to describe it is Groundbreaking.Gene Clark is as brilliant and gifted as he was/is underated which is VERY,VERY MUCH SO!Get this album.

B001GKJ2E8|1.0|One of the worst movies I have seen in the last year or two.  The plot is nonexistent, the SFX are dated and pulled right out of the matrix, and the 'twist' at the end is completely moronic.      The point of movie seems to be that you are not a 'real man' unless you want to blow someone's head off.  ugh.  on a scale of 1 to 10, this one rates a 10 for hollywood trashiness.
B00002SSKI|2.0|There were so many problems with the whole \\"mystery\\" and the scenes surrounding that, that I'm really surprised at all the 5-star reviews.  For instance, didn't anybody think it was ludicrous that grandma Cloris Leachman agreed to see the four girls when she knew she had an appointment and five minutes (or less) later, she was already late?  And then she didn't tell them what they were burning to know because \\"it took me too long to get over the trauma of it\\", or something like that.  Not to spoil anything, but huh???  The horrible, horrible thing was ridiculously guessable.  And they go to the library and find the pages ripped out of the pertinant article - \\"Someone went to a lot of trouble to keep anyone from knowing.\\"  A lot of trouble? To rip out some pages?  And the mystery is such that WHO CARES if people know??  And why was grandma the only one they could ask?  Wasn't there anybody else her age or older that would remember?  She looked like she was no older than 60 in the movie.  And Crazy Pete's explanation for his nocturnal behavior?  So, so lame.     And so Christina Ricci/Roberta grew up to be Rosie O'Donnell?  Chrissy was the one always saying \\"do you think I'm fat\\" and \\"if I don't eat every few hours, I get nauseous.\\"  How did she end up NOT being Rosie O'Donnell?      And so they vowed to come back together if any one of them needed their support.  What was the crisis, that Roberta was about to have a baby?  She didn't have any family or any other friends?  Plus Chrissy was already there - she needed all four of them?  The two that came from out of town could just drop everything and come for who-knew-how-long it would take for the baby to come?  And how convenient that it looks like it came that same day.    I gave it an extra star for Janeane Garofalo, but this movie was built on a house of cards and the performances were poor.

B001GKJ2E8|3.0|Imagine if Sam Peckinpah directed The Matrix. It would look like WANTED.  Lots of gunplay and knife fights, with gallons of blood everywhere.   Couple that with people, cars and bullets flying around in slow motion.  Then you have the gratuitous use of the F word every twelve seconds.  There are a few plot twists to keep it fairly interesting, I will admit.  Angelina Jolie has never been difficult to look at, and her tattoos seem to have taken on a life of thier own. If you're looking for a straight ahead action movie, look elsewhere, but if you're willing to politely escort any expectations of credibility to the nearest exit, then you may enjoy WANTED. This movie makes the Transporter movies seem realistic.  The Bourne Identity, this ain't. Obviously the budget was big, and there are big Hollywood names in the cast, but that has never assured a good film. WANTED isn't bad, really, just not that good.
0525951113|4.0|Part 1 of the book deals with murders and attacks committed by a daemon program against a few individuals. It's fun to read because it uses today's IT technology and the author gets nearly everything (in terms of IT technology) right. It's interesting to see what you can accomplish using today's technology, but since it's a just murder case, so no big deal here.    Part 2 and 3 jumps a few months ahead, and describes a new world order being established by a computer program which is gradually taken over major companies and recruits an army of hackers and misfits. This is interesting in terms of big ideas, and there're a lot of actions. However, if you stop and think about it, there's no way the daemon program in part 1 can accomplish the actions in part 2/3.     I think this discontinuity is the bigest problem of this book, part 2/3 is not hard to swallow on its own since this is SciFi after all, but putting this together with the realism in part 1 doesn't work well if you have some knowledge of IT technology.    Some other observations: 1. The monologue on parasites in part 2 is self defeating when applied to the daemon program in part 1, the daemon would be dead meat when faced with evolution. 2. It's unbelievable that after a year or so, no hacker has been able to hack the daemon itself from inside and use it to his/her advantage. It happens all the time in computer gaming.

B0010X745K|1.0|I will preface this review by noting that I have not read the novella on which the film is based.    This movie is Cloverfield meets Hostel meets Arachnophobia.  It is bad meets awful meets tragic.  It is a spewing geyser of awfulness.  I'm not specifically criticizing the directing or the writing, although, the screenplay if not the novella denies human nature.  If there was a parallel universe in this film, it wasn't the one pouring into this placid town.  These characters behaved abnormally at every turn.  Furthermore, as others have noted, the film is of at least two minds.  It is a cautionary tale about both reckless scientific experimentation and dogmatism.  The unnatural human behavior aside, the content of the film goes from bad to worse.  There is no light.  There is no redemption.  If this film were a painting, it would be a canvass painted black.  If this film were a meal, it would be the most bitter thing you had ever eaten.  I admit, I went into this film expecting to see a classic horror film.  We need horror films to end with the heroes reaching safety.  We need villains to get their comeuppance (the one bright spot in the film; so maybe the black canvass would have a red dot painted on it somewhere), and the hero to be vindicated.  I'm not saying there isn't a place for greek tragedies, but this film wasn't that either.  It was just awful, a series of bad things happening for no higher purpose with no virtue.    And, what was with the bugs?  Bugs from a parallel universe?  Can't we have a scary movie where the monsters don't either resemble insects or demons?

The melody has that Beatles flavor to it and you really can't ask for better from Paul than numbers like \\"Band On The Run.\\" \\"Band On The Run\\" is easily a major highlight of this CD. \\"Jet\\" rocks harder and this number is true rock and roll at its very best. Paul never sounded better and the band never plays a superfluous note! Great! \\"Ebony And Ivory\\" features Paul doing an outstanding duet with a musical giant named Stevie Wonder; and they complement each other's vocals wonderfully.<br /><br />\\"Listen To What The Man Said\\" boasts some great horn work in the musical arrangement and Paul aces this as easily as if it were just like breathing. Of course, we know it really isn't that easy; but Paul's talents always carry him through. \\"Silly Love Songs\\" was a huge hit when I was in junior high school; I remember how the girls on our school bus would sing along with Paul when this tune got some air time on the school bus radio!<br /><br />\\"Let 'Em In\\" has a great beat; and \\"Say Say Say\\" is a pretty strong, enjoyable duet with Paul and Michael Jackson singing their hearts out. The beat has a distinctive `80s feel but it's still quite good to hear \\"Say Say Say\\" even in our times. The album then takes a very sharp turn into the darkness with a hard rockin' song, \\"Live And Let Die\\" from the James Bond movie of the same name. \\"Live And Let Die\\" is an awesome number that rocks so hard you'd better hang onto your seat when you hear this! \\"Live And Let Die\\" is definitely one of Paul McCartney's best hits ever.<br /><br />\\"C Moon\\" is a somewhat lesser known Wings tune that I always enjoy; it's very well performed. \\"Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey\\" also has a distinct Beatles flavor to it but Paul's signature stamp is clearly on this number; \\"Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey\\" is also another one of Paul's most successful hits ever. Listen also for \\"Goodnight Tonight\\" by Wings; Wings does this one up right and I'm very impressed. \\"With A Little Luck\\" has an excellent melody and the electric guitars work really well for \\"With A Little Luck.\\" The album even ends strong with Paul McCartney And Wings performing \\"My Love;\\" this tender and sensitive love song was an instant classic; it sounds every bit as good today as it did when it was first released years ago.<br /><br />Overall, this isn't a bad \\"best of\\" Paul McCartney hits CD; but there's so much more for his fans to enjoy that a single CD just couldn't be complete and truly thorough.

B000EHSVQ4|5.0|Being as my experience with director's cuts involved moving scenes about, adding a few deleted scenes, and/or changing the ending (even Ridley Scott's director's cut of Blade Runner did little more than remove the ending and the voiceover), I was vastly surprised to find out that this movie had been so thoroughly butchered for a theatrical run that the \\"director's cut\\" comes out to be a whole movie in itself rather than \\"oh hey, he says an extra line different from the movie\\".<br /><br />While the extended cut adds only about 45 minutes of film, it feels like it adds a whole new half to the movie, which makes it seem for the first time like the theatrical cut was actually \\"half\\" of a movie.<br /><br />Spoilers might follow.<br /><br />A lot of new scenes include minor tidbits for entertainment, while the majority of it has further explanation, exposition, and even a full subplot that had been not quite masterfully cut from the theatrical version.<br /><br />- The whole dealy involving the priest Balian kills is explained, as it's revealed the Priest is Balian's half-brother, the legitimate son of their mother, who had Balian as a bastard.<br /><br />- It's revealed that Balian had fought in wars before, and thus had a reason for putting up such a strategic defense of Jerusalem---there is even a scene of him discussing the tactics in properly fortifying a city like Jerusalem with King Baldwin IV<br /><br />- Godfrey is shown to be the brother of the village lord where Balian lives, and the lord is the one who sends the attack raid on Godfrey.<br /><br />- Salah ad-Din beheads Reynald, which is considered more historically accurate.<br /><br />- A whole entire sub-plot is re-inserted regarding Baldwin V---Sibylla's son.  After Baldwin IV's death, Sibylla crowns her son King, only to discover after accidentally spilling hot wax on his hand that like his uncle, he has leprosy.  Rather than suffer the backlash of the people on knowledge that she has birthed a leper, and that she may lose her power for it, she kills her son with poison to spare him the leprosy and herself the loss of power.<br /><br />- Emotionally devastated by killing her son, Sibylla's actions afterwards are more recognizable and understandable beyond \\"she's an idiot\\".  Guy de Lusignon knows about the affair she's had with Balian, and uses this against her to get himself crowned King of Jerusalem after Baldwin V dies.<br /><br />To add benefits to this set is a vast collection of documentaries focused on all aspects of making the film from pre-production to post-production, working with actors from well-known Orlando Bloom, to newcomer-to-American-audiences Ghassan Massoud as Salah ad-Din, to even acknowledging the bad reviews the theatrical film received, which prompted the release of the director's cut.son to spare him the leprosy and herself the loss of power.    - Emotionally devastated by killing her son, Sibylla's actions afterwards are more recognizable and understandable beyond \\"she's an idiot\\".

B0008KLVG4|5.0|\\"Jaws\\" is a tremendously entertaining action/adventure film. It's not really a horror film although it contains horror elements. Director Spielberg draws superlative performances from his main characters played by Robert Shaw (old sea dog), Roy Scheider (local police chief), and Richard Dreyfuss (shark expert) and it's their interplay which is particularly memorable. Brilliantly directed and conceived by Spielberg and featuring the iconic John Willams theme - this is a film classic. Don't bother with any of the sequels.
B00005JPCF|3.0|South polar-izing in this case, but it's hard to miss the fact that some people really love this movie and some really...well...don't.<br /><br />I just saw this movie twice over the past three days, and here's my take on it, with the upsides and the downsides.<br /><br />The upsides were:<br /><br />The animation technology!  Some of the animation, especially the backgrounds, was drop dead gorgeous.  I don't even have HD, and I was mesmerized by how beautifully done some parts of this movie were.<br /><br />The misfit becomes a hero.  It hit sort of close to home for my wife and I because we have a special needs child and have often felt like Memphis and Norma Jean.  What went wrong?  We sigh a lot and wonder what will become of him.  I quietly hope he will develop some great talent some day.  We'll see.<br /><br />An environmental message that wasn't too heavy handed.  The humans are not presented as evil, just as being who didn't know what they were doing.  Once they discovered the penguins, they helped them out.  At least this movie didn't stoop to the now very tired \\"man is bad\\" cliche message.<br /><br />Interesting symbology.  The \\"Memphis\\" character was obviously Elvis, and Norma Jean was Marilyn Monroe?  The two icons of the 1950's give birth to a misfit who revolutionalizes music among a sort of authoritarian theocratic paternal oligarchy.  Is this supposed to be something like what happened when rock 'n roll took America by storm in the late 1950's and early 60's?  The fundamentalists preached against rock 'n roll, and the kids just wanted to have fun.<br /><br />The music itself.  I found it varied and rather enjoyable.  I've never liked that \\"Somebody to Love\\" song by Queen, but I genuinely enjoyed the way it was rendered by the penguin choir.<br /><br />Finally, extrapolating on the fact that penguin couples can identify each other out of the masses of penguins because each has a unique call.  This I assume was the inspiration for the idea that penguins mate when they find \\"their song\\".<br /><br />Now the downsides:<br /><br />I found the adult penguin characters to be designed in a way that didn't make them particularly endearing to look at.  I thought the penguins in Surf's Up (which anyone who likes this movie should see too; it's brilliant) were designed to look more fun and loveable.  The hint of breasts on the female penguins just made them look sort of weird.<br /><br />One dimensional stereotype characters.  There's the overbearing authoritarian fundamentalists, the holy roller preacher, the \\"five amigo\\" wise guys, the skua bird gang, etc.  There just wasn't much depth anywhere in the character department.<br /><br />Very little genuine humor.  A lot of what was supposed to be humor seemed forced, Disney Style.  I was entertained throughout the movie, but I only really laughed two or three times.<br /><br />And, one big helping of subliminal vulgarity.  I read it elsewhere and so out of curiosity I freeze framed through the sequence where Gloria and Happy Feet emerge from their first swim and tumble through the snow, and yes it lookes like they went through the catalogue of sexual positions.  That was crass, but then this movie is rated PG for a reason.  I mean, what parent would think that a fuzzy little cute baby penguin on all the artwork would mean that they should allow their young children see it?  Who would get that idea anyway?<br /><br />So, a solid three stars for a movie that pretends to be for the little ones but richly deserves a PG rating and perhaps PG-13.  Now, my happy keys gotta stop clickin'.  Tippity tippity tap tap click!I found the adult penguin characters to be designed in a way that didn't make them particularly endearing to look at.

1582701709|1.0|I think this is really a selfish, self-centered book. Everything is about \\"me, me, and me\\". I'm sorry, but I don't agree (and believe) that everything is about \\"you\\". I want to know if the author study the Bible quotes. I am a firm Christian, and I must say she did not even study the Bible because she took the meaning out of its context. NO, you can NEVER do that to the Bible and use it for your own selfish and self-centered needs. It gets to me that she dares to take it out of context and use it for her selfish needs. Honestly, I don't care how she wrote, but I care what she wrote. I'm sorry if I am being mean and harsh on this author, but when it comes to the Bible, I will refute this kind of usage.

B001GQACGE|1.0|I'm sorry I didn't \\"get\\" this CD at all. Or perhaps I was looking for something different this time around from Bee. Honestly the quality of music on this CD is the equivalent of Rhianna's first album. Bee should have really stepped her game up on this one but it seems like she took a HUGE step backwards. For someone who's 28 yrs old and been in the game for a minute I was really hoping for a mature, grown & sexy, exclusive sound. Instead, nothing soulful or passionate about the ballads, nothing special about the so-called club-bangers. Its all very monotonous. I mean, no one can take away the star power of Beyonce-she IS who she IS. But as far as this one is concerned, she doesn't separate herself AT ALL from other mainstream females. So for those who haven't bought \\"I am...\\" yet, let me whisper something in your ears: psst...LimeWire ;-)    BTW, the whole \\"deluxe\\" package thing was nothing more than a marketing scheme (that I didn't fall for..thankfully). What else would you do in a recession besides make people think they're getting more than what they're paying for?

B000EWBKLC|5.0|If you haven't seen the original Saw you really should try. If you are a horror fan, and you haven't seen this, you should be smacked with a copy of this disc and shamed. Even if horror's not your thing, don't judge a book by it's cover. Yes, there are some very graphic scenes captured on film here, however the story is one of the most original. If you liked Cube and the originality and level of tone this is right up your alley. The filmmakers assembled an excellent cast that completely sell the idea. This is not the PG-13 Japanese remake after remake stuff that has over saturated the market in recent years. This is a good psychological horror film with some very graphic elements.     The Blu Ray version of this film improves upon the DVD rather dramatically. Capturing all of the beautiful yet dirty and grimey set design. The 6.1 & 5.1 audio tracks are used to their full advantage really giving this film as much mood and dimension as the cinematography. From the annoying humming of lighting fixtures to the intense score, it is probably one of the better atmospheric creations for a surround sound experience that doesn't feature the typical action fare of gun shots and explosions continuously and exhaustingly.     Lionsgate has been one of the original supporters and most reliable makers of Blu Ray discs to date. Their BR discs are consistently some of the finest available for picture and sound. I would love to see Cube 1 & 2 amongst others in the catalogue of similar nature on BR.
0525951113|3.0|With all the hype about this book, I felt compelled to read it, and I was not disappointed . . . for the first half of the book.  But then I got to towards the end, and the writing became less persuasive, the plot became downright silly, the author never tied up several loose ends, and the characters who had been so finely drawn at the beginning became fairly flat and boring.  The last part of the book seemed to have been written only with the idea of making things easy for Hollywood scriptwriters, but not with a mind to please thoughtful readers. The book is best on the tech stuff, and I don't fault any of that.  It's fine amusement for a long airplane ride, too. But with this author's talents, I wish he had thought the last half of the book through with the same care and attention that he gave to the first half.

B000EQ47GS|5.0|Boston based rockers (fittingly named) Boston released their self-titled debut album in September of 1976.<br />Boston was a great band that was the mastermind of guitarist/chief songwriter/keyboard player Tom Scholz and lead singer (the late great) Brad Delp (who was superb at triple tracking his vocal harmonies to make him sound like three people singing when it was all him).<br />In addition, there was guitarist Barry Goudreau, bass player Fran Sheehan and drummer Sib Hashian.<br />The album was mainly recorded in Scholz's basement but you would not have known. I first heard and received this album on my 11th birthday on cassette in January of 1987 and still is one of my favorites today.<br />The album's opener \\"More Than a Feeling\\" was a great song and was a monster hit and a great song. We follow with the rocking \\"Peace of Mind\\" which is a great song and deserves its play on rock radio. The first half closing \\"Foreplay\\"/\\"Long Time\\" is one of the best epics ever recorded in rock history. Tom did most of the guitar work on the album while Barry does the soaring leads on \\"Long Time\\" and \\"Let Me Take You Home Tonight\\" (on the original cassette version \\"Foreplay\\"/\\"Long Time\\" was at the end of side two).<br />The second half opening \\"Rock and Roll Band\\" was written about how the band got their deal with Epic. \\"Smokin'\\" follows and is, literally, a fiery rocker with one of the best organ solos played by Scholz. The melodic \\"Hitch a Ride\\" is next and is a great song. \\"Something About You\\" is next and is another great rocker. The ballad which ends in a rocking fashion \\"Let Me Take You Home Tonight\\" rounds out this masterpiece of an album (ironically these latter two tracks ended side one of the cassette version of the album to ensure almost equal playing lengths).<br />Despite the fact Boston's debut was recorded in 1976, it sounds like it was recorded yesterday and this band got the success it deserved because of the music contained and how well it was recorded and played and not how well they dressed nor looked!<br />The first Boston album is still a staple of album rock and classic rock radio stations respectively today (35 years later) and until recently (when Guns and Roses' monster debut Appetite for Destruction took over in 2009) was the largest selling debut album in history (not even poseurs like 90s \\"flash in the pan\\" Alanis Morrisette nor the 90s equal to The Starland Vocal Band called Hootie and the Blowfish could topple) with 17 million sold in the US alone and peaked at #3 back in 1976.<br />In time for its 30th anniversary, Tom Scholz and Epic Records re-release Boston's debut with a killer remastering job and the album has not ever sounded better.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!ll they dressed nor looked!

B001ACH4DS|5.0|Saw David Cook on AI and in concert - great songs; great performance; not a thing I would change for his debut.

B001GKJ2FW|2.0|Back in the eighties when ABBA packed the pop charts, Eddie Murphy's hilarious promotional parody \\"Buckwheat Sings\\" featured a black member of the Our Gang/Little Rascals ensemble. As living proof that reality can be stranger than Murphy, Pierce Brosnan, who famously stole the identity of Remington Steele in the 80s series of the same name, is cast as a putative father and singer in Mamma Mia! In this role, Brosnan unsuccessfully attempts to carry a tune in a bucket.     First the good part-this is a gorgeous movie in Blu-ray. The blue and green hues of a Greek isle, festooned with red and purple flowers and sun-bleached masonry are breath-taking. Movies like this were truly meant to be enjoyed on Blu-ray.     Now the bad part-high end audio quality does nothing to enhance the croak of Mr. Brosnan's voice. In fact the producers should have realized that before committing to a Blu-ray edition that accentuates the negatives of one of many casting catastrophes.     Basically even though The Streep can sing, she (and her entourage of girlfriends and ex-boyfriends) are about fifteen years older than the plot credibly envisions. Nearly sixty-something women with twenty year old daughters had them either late in life or not at all. The premise after all is that Streep's daughter is about the same age as her mother when she was conceived by one of the three ex-boyfriends. Instead we see a Geritol-swigging parental generation dancing and singing with kids young enough to consider Leonardo diCaprio an elder statesman.     All of this just goes to show that marquee stars alone cannot a film make. As to Mr. Brosnan's singing, his vocal coach, depending on what he or she had to start with, deserves either an Oscar for best special effects or to be run out of town on a rail.
B001EOQWEO|5.0|This is a cute movie. The kids love it. The lack of dialogue is refreshing. Lots of physical jokes and action more than make up for the regular snappy spoken jokes and innuendo. I have only tried the extras you can see on the TV and they are all wonderful. The games are a bit hard for my little ones (3 and 5) to understand. Actually, they were a bit hard for me to understand also, but the games are not why we bought the movie so it doesn't really matter.<br /><br />The only thing with this set is, I HATE, HATE, HATE the packaging. The paper is already showing a lot of wear and is ripping apart. I guess it makes sense (with the point of the movie being conservation) to not use a plastic case, but what sense does it make when your DVDs get so horribly scratched that you have to buy a new ones in the end? It's also difficult to store the thin cardboard packaging because it is lost among the bigger DVD cases.

B000EQ47HC|5.0|Boston's second album Don't Look Back was literally rush-released in August of 1978.<br />The album was the follow-up to their mammoth selling debut which has sold to date 17 million in the US alone and the pressure was on guitarists Tom Scholz (whom also wrote all the songs) and Barry Goudreau, lead singer (the late) Brad Delp, bass player Fran Sheehan and drummer Sib Hashian to deliver an album equal of its predecessor.<br />While they were slowly trying to complete the album, Epic/CBS wanted a blockbuster for the last quarter of 1978. Despite Scholz's objections that he was not finished, seeing as the album is only 33 minutes long, CBS literally took the tapes and released Don't Look Back.<br />Don't Look Back was the first Boston album I ever got which was the day after Christmas in 1986 and I played this baby constantly in elementary school whilst most of my fellow then-fifth graders were digging forgettable dribble like Europe and Bon Jovi, and it still sounds fresh today (for a 30 year old album, it's aged flawlessly).<br />Every song is excellent, it's difficult to say which one is my favorite.<br />The opening Top 5 charting rocking title cut is a killer way to start this album with some tasty solos from both Scholz and Goudreau. We then segue into \\"The Journey\\" which is all Scholz on organs and guitars and rhythm guitar from Goudreau. Next is the melodic rocker \\"It's Easy\\" which is another great number. The best track on the album closed the album's first side called \\"A Man I'll Never Be\\". This epic power ballad is such a beautiful song and the movements on the track is almost like listening to a classical piece.<br />The rocker \\"Feelin' Satisfied\\" kicks off the second half and like DLB's title cut is a radio staple. The next two tracks \\"Party\\" and \\"Used to Bad News\\" are great songs as well despite the fact people overlook these tracks. The former is a great Scholz/Delp collaboration whilst the latter is a Delp penned track (the only song not penned by Scholz on the album). The closing \\"Don't Be Afraid\\" was a great way to close this superb album as this rocker just plain out rocks.<br />The Don't Look Back album stormed right to #1 on Billboard and sold FOUR million in its first month and to date seven million copies.<br />This new remastered version remastered by Tom Scholz himself is superb. The booklet gives great insight into the album and the digi-pak cover looks like the original vinyl gatefold sleeve.<br />If you like the first album, get this album as well.<br />Highly recommended!The closing \\"Don't Be Afraid\\" was a great way to close this superb album as this rocker just plain out rocks.

B001E6IHV8|5.0|I have not seen the movie Slumdog Millionaire, but after reading this novel Iwill see it.  It took me less than a week to read this on my Kindle.  I couldn't put this down.  Every chapter is so intriguing and leaves you guessing how the story will relate to the show.  This book is a perfect weave of characters and plot.  I LOVED THIS BOOK and hope the movie is not a disappointment.

1857885082|5.0|Having lived in London for over a decade, I can't tell you how spot on this book is... It's much deeper than what it appears at first blush. And it's not particularly humorous. It is much more an anthropological study of the  nuances of English life.

0452289963|5.0|I read this book at a time when I was at a very low point in my life.  I had started reading it twice before and couldn't really get into it.  When I finally did, I read it, re-read it, marked it with highlighters.  And I still go back and read parts of it.  It's like a wake-up call to things I've always believed but had forgotten, not really thought about, or lost touch with.  It's definitely not what I'd call a \\"light read.\\"  You have to be able to let it sink in but it is well worth the effort.  I hae now bought two other Tolle books, and am visiting the Amazon site to buy my fourth.  Its message is non-secular, but rings true for anyone.
031606792X|5.0|I just love the whole saga. Many people say that the breaking dawn isn't what they expected and that the author was wroting it for herself. I disagree - maybe it should be a little bit longer to leave more room for some of the story lines (I feel like some of it was left a little bit short - I wanted more). But after all, knowing this is the last book of Bella's saga, I'm happy the way things turned out for the Cullens and people around them. Just great reading :)

B00127RAJY|5.0|I've lost my 15 pregnancy pounds by following this program for about four months.  Nothing else was working.  It took about a month of doing it about 3-4 times a week before I lost my first pound or two.  I'm sure that's partly because I was gaining muscle.  I decided that I needed to stick with it because I still didn't have enough muscle to burn my fat effectively.  I do it off and on now, but I definitely recommend it.  You are supposed to do it EVERY DAY for 30 Days, which is really hard to do.  The more consistently I do it, the more I lose.  The most days I've ever exercised in a row is three and I really started to lose some weight then.  I would say to just keep at it and try doing it every day, like the program states before you say it doesn't work.  BTW, it's helped my back a ton and just my overall energy level is definitely up and I can run after my children much easier.  It's also very convenient to do at home and my children like to try to do it with me.
B0017V7GTY|4.0|I have to say, after being exposed to one horrible new band after another, THESE guys are a breath of fresh air.  A band that's actually capable of writing \\"vocal melodies\\" and not oversinging, or overproducing the music with whiny lyrics that can't follow a melody.  No, this band is nothing like that- these guys are really good.      The melodies in each song are really catchy and memorable, and the lyrics are meaningful and worth paying attention to because, again, the melodies are really strong.  An album you should give a chance.  So maybe the lead singer sounds like he's ripping off Bruce Springsteen a little bit.  I don't really care.  I just like the music.

B0002DKCMG|3.0|I think the endearing quality story line in this film is great to see.  Far many other movies dont go sappy at all, while this does tend to do so a bit much, there is nothing wrong with that.  What is wrong with going sappy?  You either enjoy romantic story lines or you dont believe in romance.  Romance has died among most contemporary films.  Contemporary story lines have become more cliche though as they are now the norm. They often ignore the basis of desire for another person or longing which is not an outdated concept.  On the other hand I did find a stereotype Euro experience placed in this film that stripped a layer of realistic understanding. It made fun of the expectations that many uninformed Americans might have, just as many outsiders of the globe might have on the U.S.  Yes those misunderstandings of us exist as well.      All in all would I consider this movie horrible?  no.  Would I have bought it if it didnt come in a combo with another movie I did want? no.  Understanding that a movie of this sort isnt being built on realistic expectations and is only after a laugh, then it more than lives up to expecations.  It could have gone into many horrible cliches of stereotypes but it did manage to put a new spin on them.  I say it is a reasonably enjoyable film.  A truly groundbreaking film only comes along once in a great while and even then if you break them down, they still are just another retold story.  What matters is if they do it in a manner that affects you.   As far as movies aimed solely at guys, it will fail to impress with the movies packaging.  Guys wouldnt care to see what they can see any day in the mirror but then again I guess, it does thing outside the box so you dont know what to expect.  It would have been better with the full release of more female bodies though in the face of what was shown.  I do though think that is a joke on us so then again the comedy works.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I was so excited when I learned that this was being released on DVD that I ordered copies for two other people at the same time. If you like Joss Whedon and don't find musicals completely irritating you will LOVE this show. It's about 40 minutes long, and there are more special features than there is movie, but it's very worth it, and at such a reasonable price you can entertain yourself and your family and friends for a long time to come.
B000056TKD|5.0|This is the definitive recording of Holst's \\"The Planets\\".  This is a triumph of composition and execution.  This version is 'electrifying', to borrow another reviewer's word.  This is the way the work should be played.

B001CTA1S4|5.0|Of course a film with Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman in the lead roles has to be worth seeing since there apparently is no character that these two consummate actors cannot convincingly play. Ms. Streep as Sister Aloysius Beauvier is the sad and angry nun intent on destroying the life of Father Flynn (Hoffman) in this intense movie set in 1964. Hoffman is the new breed of Catholic priest who, in addition to wanting change in the church, really cares about the students in this secondary Catholic school. Streep will do whatever it takes to keep the status quo even if means being both dishonest and rushing to judgment without hard evidence as she sets out to railroad Hoffman. Ms. Streep walks a thin line and at times is almost one-dimensional although she ultimately succeeds as the most despicable character I believe she has ever played. (It will be a joy to see her portray Julia Child in her next film.) Mr. Hoffman is particularly good in the three sermons he gives and completely convinces you that he is a priest. I saw the movie with a friend who attended Catholic schools; he commented that Ms. Streep certainly was believable to him.<br /><br />Amy Adams as the younger Sister James who wants to believe in Father Flynn gives a good performance as well while Viola Davis as Mrs. Miller, the mother of the son who Father Flynn may or may not have had an improper relationship, with is just outrageous. For my money, she deserved the Golden Globe award she didn't receive.<br /><br />My one complaint about \\"Doubt\\" is that the ending seemed contrived. A friend of mine who has seen the play as well says that the director changed the ending in the movie. Although I think that was a mistake, \\"Doubt\\" isn't to be missed. Watching Hoffman and Streep reminded me once again of why we go to movies.
B00005N6KG|4.0|I find these headphones great for working out.  The sound is fine and the fit is great.  The problem is that the wire to the ear pieces eventually loosens or breaks inside and you lose sound to one of the ear pieces.  I too would pay a little more for increased durability.  How do we get Sony to read these reviews???
B001QD7SF0|4.0|While missing the raw power of Born to Run, and the frenzied 80s energy of Born in the USA, this album is his best in a long time and bears repeated listenings.  It's nice to hear a Springsteen ablum that reminds me both of the mature man with hints of his younger days. Overall, it's satisfying, which is how he sounds, satisified at where's he at.
B0012EM5D8|5.0|Love the DVD.  It arrived quickly and in great condition as promised.  Thank you!
B001GKJ2E8|3.0|\\"Wanted\\" is indeed an action-packed movie paced at lightening speed. My first impression was that this was like a comic book come to life, and then saw in the credits that it was actually based on a comic book series.  It certainly captures that feel.    The story is very well related in other reviews.  Young man drifting without goals and passion, gets swept into a fraternity of assassins formed a 1000 years ago.  Descended from weavers, a loom allegedly in a secret digital code, picks the names of people these trained assassins are to kill.  The young man is told   he is being trained to kill the man who killed his father, also a member of the fraternity.  But, is he?    Obviously a lot of violence, killings, car chases and the usual gallons of spilled blood.  Not for the faint of heart, but enjoyable for the legions of Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman fans.
0743289692|4.0|In this gripping memoir which is a true page turner, the author tells of her harrowing life under the represive hand of Islam and her escape to freedom in the west.  She describes the horrors of genital exision which itself is worth the price of the book.  Her command of English is remarkable. She is clearly a linguist.  This talent allows her to rise to prominance in the Dutch culture and government.  However, the prose is not elegant.  Noni darwish who wrote Now They Call Me Infidel is a better writer.  Her prose is more succint.  For this reason alone I gave the book 4 stars instead of 5.  I think nearly every reader will find this book easy to read.  It is a good choice for book clubs, because it open many discussion topics.  Of great interest is the unlikely possibility for mideast peace when Muslims teach their children in schools that Jews are evil and have horns growing out of their heads.  They are called donkeys and monkeys.  Christians and the western world are also berated though to a lesser degree.  Perhaps, this is because there are so many more Christians who would take offense and perhaps even refuse to deal with muslim countries.  She dispells the notion that islam is a peaceful religion by quoting violent passages straight out of the Koran.  I think this memoir should be required reading for all high school students both here and abroad.  If only it were required reading in Muslim schools here and abroad including  schools in the mideast, then real progress  might be made in Israel.
0312360266|1.0|My 12 year old daughter really wants to read Twilight, \\"All the other kids have read it\\" I hadn't read it but suspected it of too much romance for her age. So this book Marked is on her book list at school and worth 20 points, so I said OK. I began to read these reviews and others to see if it was appr. and I became very concerned. I asked her to hold off until I read it, and boy am I glad I did.   It is garbage. Trite, and fowl. The author tries to make the villain a villain by making her a murderous, pot inhaling tramp. Alot of cursing, and talk of drinking and sex. Now I will say that the author does paint those things in a poor light, but she refers to the same sex scene no less than 10 times. And it is just so lame, all kinds of 'funny' lil statements in () after sentences.  It is so shallow there is no chance of drowning in the plot.   Now I am writing this review both to say that it IS NOT FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. I am very bothered that it is being passed around in my daughters 6th grade class room,(yes I am calling the Principal) and also because it's just not a good book.   I also told her I would read Twilight, and while I was really dreading it after reading this crap. It was a pleasant surprise to read a well written book.(not great, well written) Not that my daughter will be reading it any time soon.

B0019EXZY4|2.0|I was very excited to see this movie after all the great reviews I read.  What a huge disappointment!  It was not entertaining in the least, and the audience is never made to care about any of these characters.  In fact, the characters don't really care about each other, either.    There is a sad lack of humor, action, or even a light at the end of the tunnel.  Who are we rooting for in this film?  I'm not sure really.  It was a sad disappointment, especially since I was so interested in seeing the film.

B001FSDOZO|5.0|Wow, what an amazing CD! Believe it or not, the first time I'd ever heard of Nickelback was at church during a service. That's right. They played a portion of the song SAVE ME which by the way is a great song, on an amazing album, ALL THE RIGHT REASONS.<br /><br />Every now and then I check to see if they have anything new out. Now mind you, I'm a country lover through and through. Love Josh Turner, Blake Shelton, Craig Morgan, Rodney Adkins, Trent Tomlinson, just to name a few. But I like to think of myself as a well rounded person when it comes to music. So I checkout out a few of the songs on Youtube and Amazon, and knew right away I had to have this one. I've only had it for a shot time but let me tell you, it's nothing short of amazing. I love it. There are many great songs that will grip your soul. Chad is an amazing singer and song writer. He has an amazingly unique sexy voice. And the words...WOW, how deep and profound, and to add that to his voice and the way the music is put together is nothing short of a gift from God.<br /><br />I still have yet to figure out if he is a man of God but from many of his lyrics, if he is not, I'd have to guess he will one day.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Put simply, Firefly is one of the best television shows ever.    The fact that it was taken away so quickly does not take away from its brilliance.  If you've never seen it, do yourself a favor and watch the first couple of episodes.  I guarantee that you'll end up watching the whole series.    In a nutshell: great writing, great acting, great music, pretty much great everything...great show.

B0018CWEYY|5.0|We are huge fans of LOST. Season 4 is by far the craziest season. You really have to stay focused on the storyline. Everyone is all over the place, but it's still just as great as any of the other seasons. I think Season 1 is still our favorite, but all the seasons are uniquely different and wonderfully produced.

B000056HE9|4.0|Like \\"Life With Father,\\" also issued in 1947, this is an old-fashioned \\"nice\\" film. Cary Grant, Loretta Young and David Niven make up an impressive trio of stars, but Grant has the best role. He makes the best of it, too, with expressions on his face that are funnier than most of the lines he delivers.    One not-so-family oriented thing he does, however, as the \\"angel,\\" is go out on dates with the bishop's wife (Young). No respectable married woman, especially back then, would ever do that. At least the two of them recognize this fact later. Niven plays the bishop and, as usual in the film world, is portrayed as a weak clergyman.    Nonetheless, it is a charming, feel-good movie that entertains through most of it. There are a few special-effects in here, too, that are good even by today's standards. One example would be the Christmas tree lighting scene.    This would make a good Christmas movie for people looking for suitable films during that holiday.

031606792X|2.0|**SPOILERS**After being an big fan of the first three books, I was chomping at the bit to get my hands on this one.  The first few chapters were fine...I expected the wedding, the honeymoon, etc.  I even liked the way Meyer delicately wrote about Bella and Edward's first official night together.  As soon as the baby entered the picture, however, my eyes were continually rolling and I felt I had been cheated (and the NAME...that was REALLY ridiculous...).  Of course this is Meyer's world, and as the creator she gets to decide what befalls her characters, but at what price?  To me, the characters no longer fit within the roles she had created for them.  I almost quit reading it several times but thought it would eventually all make sense.  It never quite did for me.  The ending is what everyone would think is a perfect little package, but it's lacking in so many ways.  It's almost like Meyer had a deadline and had to bring it all to a conclusion, so she thought of the quickest way to give each character what they wanted.  It was a letdown, and it's too bad readers will remember this as the finale for an otherwise gripping series.  I can't imagine what readers would have said had J.K. Rowling done the same with the 7th Harry Potter.  Luckily she knew her characters well enough by then to give us a really satisfying ending.

1439110123|5.0|This is the most recent reprint of Michael Yergin's Pulitzer Prize winning work on the history of oil.<br /><br />Overall, this is the standard. Michael Yergin, now the CEO of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, in 1991 wrote this tome which is the defacto standard text and reference for anyone interested in reading about the history of oil.<br /><br />This is a meticulously researched book which chronicles the rise of oil from Pennsylvania through the present. Yergin weaves a comprehensive chronological narrative of how the modern oil industry came into existence. This work from Michael Yergin won the Pulitzer Prize to boot.<br /><br />There are numerous books on oil. Many focus on peak oil. Some focus on the tyranny or how the industry is downright evil. This book though is all about the facts. College history professors could use this book. It presents the facts and the history and lets the reader reach any conclusions they want.  Some have mentioned that this work is \\"pro-oil\\" but in my frank opinion, the book merely focuses on the facts vs the rhetorical or political aspects of the industry.  After you read this book, you can make up your own mind or read supplementary materials to develop your own position.  However, without reading this book, it is somewhat difficult to develop an informed opinion on the industry.  If you want to know the history of the oil industry, this is the one stop shop.<br /><br />Beware though, this is not light reading. Sometimes it reads very fast and sometimes you muddle through it depending on what aspect of the oil industry you're interested in.<br /><br />After studying this work the reader will be able to intelligently speak about the history of oil and see through many of the shallower and erroneous assumptions people make about the industry.<br /><br />If you have to buy 1 and only 1 book on oil. Get The Prize by Yergin.
0316017922|5.0|I found this book to be deeply thought provoking and challenging of ideas and assumptions.  The comparisons and contrasts were well documented and explained.  It felt accessible to the average person, through simple vocabulary, crisp concise writing and by avoiding intellectual jargon and a high-brow style that can often deter and restrict an audience to a particular demographic.  I read this book quickly and with determination to absorb as much as I could, I was gripped from page 1 and feel I can take a new perspective with me regarding success. I can better understand some of life's seemingly random and unfair occurrences.  I chose this book for enjoyment and recreational reading and was more than pleased.
B0009MAO46|5.0|We used to watch the movie CARS all the time, but now that we got Toy Story, we watch this close to everyday.  My son just turned 4 and he loves the movie.  He now plays with his Mr. PotatoHead everyday since watching this movie!!  It's a keeper!
0375826726|5.0|If you have read my other reviews for this series, then you know how a feel - if you haven't, I strongly recommend reading them, especially if you are trying to decide whether or not to buy this or any other of the inheritance books!    This book is a fine read, it is not as good as the first (Eragon), but in opinion it beats out the second (Eldest) as far as overall writing is concerned. It is, as some have said, a bit drawn out, but that is my only complaint.   WARNING: I do not suggest this book to anyone if they have not read the first two already!  HOWEVER: If you have read them, then what are you waiting for, click the \\"buy\\" button!!!
B000002H33|5.0|Master Of Puppets. Wow. I do not even know what to say about this album. From the beginning to the very end, this album is a no-holds barred sonic adrenaline overdose. This truly is the greatest thrash album ever, and quite possibly the greatest metal album ever. There really is no filler here. Every single track on Master Of Puppets is pure, unadulterated metal.    Battery is here to stay!!!
B001QKSWOE|4.0|i love the stephanie plum series so much, but am often disapointed when i read the between the numbers books.  the whole unmetionable thing is not my cup of tea, and i always miss morelli and ranger who are hardly mentioned.  this one was much better,  full length, same fave characters, and a little less of the unmentionable stuff.  it was the stephanie plum i look forward to reading. you are going to enjoy this.
B000QUCNOK|1.0|Perfume was a very odd and disturbing movie. The only real reason I watched it was because its different. Its very very hard to find good movies that are different. Most of them are made from the same old boring cookie cutter that they have used for the last 30 years or so.    So when a movie comes along that promises something unique and creative, I just have to watch it. This was certainly the case with this one. Jean-Baptiste Grenouille was born with a very special gift. His nose. He was able to smell things that very few of us can.     But he was so obsessed with capturing smells, that he killed so that he could hold on to that smell. This is sick enough, but the end was so upsetting and so strange, that it made me sick myself. The movie is a very dark physoligical thriller, which is why I found this part to be especially odd.     It seems that Jean-Baptiste Grenouille created a perfume that was so captivating, so hypnotic that people that smelled it were put under some sort of spell.    In the one scene is question, Jean-Baptiste Grenouille unveils his new perfume. The entire crowd of a few hundred take off their clothes and engage is a huge orgy.     Now if this were a comedy, perhaps I could except it. But this, is a serious dark thriller. I dont get it. And the scene was soo disturbing, that it brought down the entire movie.     The movie was a dissaster for me.
B001GZ6QBU|5.0|Where to begin? Not only is \\"TDK\\" one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, but a double whammy of recent outspoken independence regarding the film really clinched it for me. First of all, I love that the DVD isn't the special features-laden 5 disc set everyone obviously hoped it would be. Buy a DVD for the movie. How many making-of featurettes could you possibly need, anyway?! Secondly, the recent snub with the Oscars has just gone to show me that a movie like this doesn't need approval from anyone to still be amazing. Just as the Bat inevitably becomes the one holding the bag, so does the rest of the movie become the heroic piece of work that it should be in the collective eyes of the public.
B00008976Y|4.0|The Bottom Line:    Somber and meditative, Blue is probably the least accessible of Kieslowski's trilogy but Binoche is very good and by the conclusion patient viewers will probably feel their 100 minute commitment was not in vain; if you like quiet dramas, Blue is for you.
B001GKJ2FM|3.0|\\"Mamma Mia!\\" is by no means a bad movie, but is unequivocably the epitome of what a chick flick should be. My mom and sister love it to pieces and that's why I got it. Not my forte, but by all means, enjoy it, those who do.
6305127697|3.0|The Bottom Line:    A ridiculous courtroom drama that falls back on every cliche (including multiple personalities, for the love of Pete), Primal Fear hums merrily along but it's by no means a good movie.
B0007CNXUU|5.0|The DVD Finding Neverland arrived in a Quick and Reasonable amount of time.  The DVD plays fine and we saved $$$money$$$ by buying On-Line through an Amazon.com merchant.  The Movie itself you would have thought that you bought it new the day it came out.  We will continue to use Amazon.com occasionally to buy DVD's and other merchandise.  In times like this, you have to use what for resources you have available to you to use which are the most cost effective and the availability of this or any other particular item(s).  Thank you!!

0743518144|1.0|I ordered this book- NEW- and received it in time for needing to take the assessment.  This book is required for the Business class I am taking.  I went to enter the code and it said it had already been used!  I am very P-O'd because a great deal of my grade is resting on my assessment and how I enterpet it.  I don't know if I can get a replacement- I emailed the seller- I doubt there is anything that can be done.  I don't have money to go purchase this again... I am frustrated because it IS a good book- but I feel it's not worth it if you can't take the assessment.  There could be a better way to distribute the code.  Or maybe the book should be SEALED or something.  Now, I will probably fail this course.
B00005O3VC|5.0|I haven't seen this movie in quite some time and it hasn't lost a thing. Halarious!
0670020745|5.0|The author captured both the medical and personal side of having a stroke. Also, the way to heal, and the possibilities of healing with the corect stimulation was most insightful.  Everyone should read this book to gain \\"insight\\" should they ever need to use it! It would provide much guidance and encouragement.  I'm thinking more and more often how to use the right side of my brain. .  . .
B000V86OKG|5.0|I loved the first season of Dexter and was not disappointed by the 2nd seasion! I once again got hooked and kept watching episode after episode into the wee hours of the morning.<br />I was disappointed by the increased graphic nudity compared to the first season. I don't think it is necessary or appropriate.<br />I can't wait to watch season 3.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This DVD series is incredible. I watched it when it aired a couple years ago on the Discovery channel with Sigourney Weaver narrating. I looked forward to it so much every week and was amazed by the quality of the picture, even on my old TV.    Then I got a plasma TV and decided to purchase the whole series, knowing it would be even better on a big flat screen and having heard that the David Attenborough version was even better. It's all true. I could watch each episode over and over again, just amazed by the scenes that the photographers managed to capture, with the informative (but not sciencey) narration. You see things that you couldn't ever imagine had existed, in the depths of the oceans, on the highest mountains, hidden in caves.     It's a truly wonderful series and great for everyone, all ages, etc. Very very highly recommended.
B00006HYQ5|5.0|It's light as a feather, precise enough to nudge it and the cursor moves just 1 pixel, the wheel is stiff and clicks through its turns instead of rolling freely, and the buttons take a firm press and they click sharply. It's a little unusual because of its small size (you need to become a \\"claw\\" style mouse user), but you'll never want to go back to pushing around a big awkward mouse again.
B000I5YCCO|5.0|The very first time I heard Taylor on the radio in July of 2006 I fell in love! I love both of her CDs. My favorite songs are Tim McGraw, Picture to Burn, A Place In this World, The Outside, Our Song, Mary's Song My, Oh, My and Tear Drops on my guitar. Taylor I love you! I'm looking forward to more albums from you! Keep up the lovely, fantastic work!
0224619101|4.0|[[ASIN:B0006C2TBK Bomber: Events Relating to the Last Flight of an R.A.F. over Germany on the Night of June 31, 1943]]  Here in 2009 Mr. Deighton's famous novel sits beside Slaughterhouse-Five on many bookshelves as well as in the esteem of readers and scholars.  The book needs no more reviews.  I write only to point out a surprising technical error unexpected from someone like Len Deighton.  Bomber is historical fiction narrated by an omniscient third party in the contemporaneous present tense.  This style, a common one for this genre, keeps the reader very much involved with the plot as it unfolds.  Then, on page 272 of the Jonathan Cape Ltd. edition, appears this sentence, \\"Today's pressurized, high-speed, high-altitude, jet-propelled traveller might find it hard to imagine the very different experience that flying was to these men.\\"  Reading this I felt as if someone a row back had interrupted me during a really good movie.  Tracers had just curved by my cockpit and splashed into the sea.  What rude person was intruding with this inane editorializing?  Mr. Deighton's entire novel is like an editorial on the horrors of war, but the genius of the book is how understated this message remains.  Of course it does nothing to diminish the book.  It is simply an interesting example of how difficult it really is to keep disbelief suspended and readers personally involved in a story.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|Taylor Swift rocks! This album is just as good as the last one! I could not ask for more! Taylor Swift is beutiful, charming, talented young lady! My favorite songs are Fearless, Fifteen, Love Story, White Horse, Tell Me Why, That's the Way I loved You and Change. I can relate to all of her songs! Taylor I love You, keep up the fantastic work!
0743556003|5.0|I read some of the other reviews and I have to wonder if we are all talking about the same book.  I loved it although some of those sessions with dear old dad made me cringe.  I didn't read the written text, maybe that is why my prospective is different.  For all that have negative reviws I suggest to check out the audio version read by Mare Winningham. She does an A-1 job from first page to last.  Sowisa Babyluv.
B000T9OP7G|5.0|What is there to say other than Terminator: TSCC is TOTALLY FREAKING AWESOME!!!!! I love that it provides a different perspective and timeline for fans of the movies. What I like best is the change in the timeline because I loved the first two movies but was extremely disappointed with T3: Rise of The Machines. Fox has created an excellent show and I pray they don't cancel this show too. Summer Glau is an amazing actress and Fox has already dumped her once when they cancelled Firefly... Another TOTALLY FREAKING AWESOME SHOW!!!!! Too bad Fox didn't realize how badly they screwed up cancelling Firefly, hopefully they can fix that by continuing to produce great episodes of The Sarah Connor Chronicles.<br /><br />As I said, Summer Glau is an amazing actress. I highly enjoyed her in the show Firefly co-starring Nathan Fillion, who by the way hasn't had too great of a track record with Fox since they cancelled his new show Drive in 2007. That show was TOTALLY FREAKING AWESOME too!!!!! Fox... They just don't know when they have a good thing. But anyway, she is also awesome in the movie counterpart to Firefly, Serenity.<br /><br />Lena Headey... I admit the only movie I've seen her in is the movie 300. A movie I deeply enjoyed. And she carries that same strong performance she gave from 300 to the set of The Sarah Connor Chronicles.<br /><br />I haven't seen much of Thomas Dekker other then the little bit of Heroes I've seen. But from just that bit I can tell he's gonna be one hell of an actor.<br /><br />Brian Austin Green, damn. I haven't seen him since he was in Kickboxer 2 back in 1991. Still, he's a good actor and he fits the role of Derek Reese. My favorite scene from The Sarah Connor Chronicles has to be in the last episode of season one, when Derek takes John out for ice cream for his brithday and shows him a young Derek and Kyle Reese playing baseball in the park.<br /><br />I hope this review has been helpful. If you need to know about other great enterainment like movies, video games, and more tv shows... I'll Be Back!... I'll Be Back!

B001DDBCV4|5.0|Actually I bought the blu-ray because I loved the movie when they played it on movie theaters.
B000VSBX34|5.0|Having been a 'Beatles' fan since they came on the scene in the 60's,the 'HELP!' DVD still shows what a funny and great film it is, being a typical  British sense of humour,showing John as very witty,Ringo comedian with Paul and George as the straight men.        It comes over as a very clever film with fantastic songs,the film being ahead of it's time.The one thing though the missing scene with Wendy Richard. My personal opinion is the scene itself has been destroyed  on the cutting room floor or somebody working on the film has it without realizing, would defiantly been on the DVD.Having said this it is a great film and for young people to see how great THE BEATLES were
B001GKJ2FW|5.0|When I first saw this movie on the theater I loved it. I even got emotional, it's a beautiful movie, the photography is amazing, Meryl Streep is great as always, and of course she's always the key to make a  movie that becomes great just by her presence there.  the blu-ray version is perfect, although it takes a little while to  read the disc at first, probably due to the many options it gives, as the sing-along, or the history of ABBA. This is a movie that I had to ad to my collection, and I'm sure I'm gonna see it many times, as a little child who watches over and over the same movie. I loved it that much.
B001NY42KQ|5.0|My daughter wanted this DVD, but I couldn't find a place to preorder it locally.  Glad I found it here!

B000LB7G00|5.0|I had a few problems getting it installed on a modern Windows XP box. It took three tries, including a complete uninstall, but once installed and enabled the improvement in my Blender3D capabilities (as well as Google Earth) is wonderful and effortless.     I also installed it on Ubuntu Linux and am equally happy. Highly recommended!    Note: I didn't need the tech support of the SE version, but I'm a very experienced programmer. If your time is valuable, pay the extra $25 just in case.

0882847953|5.0|or maybe I'm being unfair ... but I first used Syncopation back when I first took drum lessons (1965 or so) ... and I remembered many of the instruction beats to the point where I entered my 4th or 5th childhood at age 52 and bought the book again (and there they were -- 1 e & a, etc.).  Between this and [...] (nate brown, instructor), relearning to read and getting my chops back was a breeze (and nostalgic).<br /><br />If you're thinking about drumming, you gotta have this ... which is rated the 2nd best all-time book behind \\"stick control\\" ... I never used stick control but will probably take a look-see down the road.
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|Very cute, very funny - and very sweet.  In a career of playing jaded, bitter, or shallow little men who end up finding redemption, love, and renewed decency, Bill Murray may be at his very best in this wonderful movie of a dissatisfied meteorologist sent on an assignment he loathes, and finds himself inexplicably stuck in a time loop from which he cannot escape, being forced to live the same 24 hours endlessly.  How many years or even decades pass is unclear, (though it is probably a great length of time), but the learning and mellowing process of Our Hero is remarkable to watch.  What can I say?  I love this movie, and so will you.
0446402389|5.0|Growing up in the 80's and 90's I only heard stories about communist Russia but never had any idea of how insane it must have been to live in those times.  A great read that keeps you guessing until nearly the end when all is revealed.  The main character goes through such a life altering transformation as does his wife.  It is very sad to think that people live in such fear of their own thoughts and actions.  It definitely makes you appreciate the fact that we are allowed to speak our mind without fear of being tortured and sent to die in a gulag.  I can't wait to see what this guy writes next.  Tom Rob Smith definitely has quite the talent.  Maybe they'll make this book into a movie, but only if they hold true to the content and don't stray from this well-written novel.
0743298039|5.0|This book is a thoroughly enjoyable and engaging great read.  Two intelligent women meet, as biographer and celebrated subject and, together, relate the compelling saga of a family of gothic dysfunction and secrets. Wonderfully paced with a rewarding and satisfying ending. Highly recommended.
B001DJ7PQ4|4.0|Greetings from Wellington, New Zealand    Season four of Doctor Who has a lot in common with season three - a new companion, a thread that runs through the whole series (disappearing planets, disappearing bees and the periodic return of one of the series most-loved characters), and (unfortunately) the same mid-season sag.    The (semi) new companion Donna (Catherine Tate) is far more substantial a character than Martha, more able to key off the Doctor (a scene where the two end up impersonating one another had me rolling on the floor). Her development from the vacuous to well someone brillant is one of the highlights of the series.    The series begins with \\"Partners in Crime\\" - featuring the reunion of the Doctor and Donna who are each investigating the self described \\"galactic supernanny\\" Ms Foster. Lighter in tone than much of the rest of the series it also begins this seasons linking thread.     The linking thread is strengthened in the next episode \\"Fires of Pompeii\\". This is one of those \\"meh\\" episodes that contains a little piece of info that takes singificance later (a bit like Season Three's \\"Lazarus Experiment\\").    \\"Planet of the Ood\\" - portrays the Ood as a slave race fighting for freedom. Fans of Blackadder watch for Tim McInerney. Also listen for a musical motif (the song of freedom) that pops up throughout the series and a chilling prophecy at the end.      Then there's the mid-season two parter - \\"the sontaran strategem\\" and \\"the poison sky\\".  Much stronger story than Helen Raynor's last efforts (Daleks In Manhattan) with a neat climate change message thrown in. NB Freema Agyeman returns for these episodes and the next \\"the doctors daughter\\".     The mid-season sag begins with frankly a silly take on the classic Agatha Christie who-dunnit (including Agatha Christie). So unmemorable I cna't even remember the title. This must go close to the \\"worst episode\\" award.    There's yet another two parter - Silence in the library/Forest of the Dead, featuring ER's Alex Kingston as the mysterious Riva Song (who appears to be someone to the Doctor - just not yet).       So to the season finale, which I would rate as behind only the \\"army of ghosts/doomsday\\" pairing for impact, acting and story. The arc also features something of a reunion as charcaters from this series,and its spin-offs appear. The arc begins with a neat twist on the \\"what if we'd never met\\" scenario in \\"Turn Left\\" - we see more of Donna's family in this episode than elsewhere, before the big reveal as the barriers between universes breakdown.  An old enemy and its creator return (again) in \\"The Stolen Earth\\" - as times children unite to fight a common enemy but where is doctor when earth needs him most. The doctor races agianst time to prevent a mad scientists plans for universal destruction in Journeys End (be warned this episode WILL make you cry in several places). Some interesting possibilities for the spin-off series are raised in the finale (fans of Torchwood be warned - watch the end of series two first as this arc has spoilers).

B000NA2776|5.0|Saw Glamazons on \\"America's Got Talent\\".  Found their website.  Found they had performed with Mika to \\"Big Girl You are Beautiful\\" and one song led to another.  Next thing I knew, I had all his songs as favorites on youtube.  Next, I put the CD on my Amazon wishlist.  Sis listened and wanted it to workout to.  I've now bought & given away a bunch of these CDs to friends who play it over and over.  Thank you, Mika, for some music with a positive feel.  Reminds me of how much fun I had when I first listened to the Proclaimers \\"Sunshine on Leith\\".  This music has some nice variety and gives me a smile and skippy injection of pop every time I listen.
B0000DJZA0|5.0|I love this CD and DVD set.  The CD is sounds great.  It is an awesome cd to take a long drive with.  The DVD is nice for background noise at home.  I highly recommend this purchase for anyone who enjoys Coldplay.  The live noises are a great touch to their songs.
0792165020|5.0|One of my favorite films.  You will find no redemption for Tom   Ripley in this film which allows a range of acting that knows no boundry.  Ripley always wins...or does he>  See all the Ripley series on DVD!
B000YABYLA|4.0|Juno talks like a character in Dawsons Creek, i.e like no 16 year old you ever met, but I thought she was pretty sexy and I wish I was her friend when I was 16. Or indeed at any time. Is that bad? The film is quirky but contrived quirky, its done almost too well, but I chuckled at it, and felt that it was more worthy than my usual DVD views. It was no \\"Captain Lust and His Pirate Women\\" though, now THAT was a film.
B001L5SXQG|4.0|I've read that a lot of people are saying that this is Bruce's worst album of his career. This may be true. But that is why he is THE BOSS. When your worse album is still a great album. There are only two weak songs on this CD. Queen and Suprise, Suprise. I thoroughly enjoyed every other track on this CD. Yes its not the old Bruce, but he's not the old Bruce.

B001JRB16U|5.0|When we recently went to see Walt Disney's landmark 1964 musical fantasy transformed into a Broadway musical, I approached it much the same as when I first saw \\"Superman the Movie\\" in 1978. The earlier version was such a part of so many lives it seemed inconceivable that anyone could make it work as a live musical.<br /><br />Superman managed to succeed beyond expectations, and so does \\"Mary Poppins\\" on Broadway. The movie and the show are related yet compliment each other. Not an easy task.<br /><br />How this was accomplished is chronicled in a new documentary on the new two-disc \\"Mary Poppins 45th Anniversary Edition DVD.\\"<br /><br />The original stage stars, Ashley Brown (who knew she wasn't really English?) and Gavin Lee discuss the process from audition to production, along with the talented artists who brought Poppins alive on stage.<br /><br />Well worth the DVD set alone is the ENTIRE \\"Step in Time\\" show-stopper filmed right from the stage, complete with one of the most talked about marvels in the show: Bert's miraculous dance around and over the stage proscenium. Lee explains the evolution of the stunt in the accompanying documentary.<br /><br />We also were able to glimpse one of the sweeps in \\"Step in Time,\\" the immensely talented Sean McCourt, who plays several roles in the stage Poppins as he did for years in Wicked. We were fortunate enough to learn of his contributions from a backstage Wicked presentation he hosted with equally gifted colleague Anthony Galde, who still plays multiple roles in that show.<br /><br />The most warmhearted and reassuring thing about the new 45th Anniversary bomus material is the generous attention afforded to the cooperative relationship between Richard M. Sherman and the new songwriters, George Stiles and Anthony Drewe (Robert Sherman's health prevents the activity).<br /><br />And while you may think it's a no-brainer that Mr. Sherman was included to some extent, consider that after the duo successfully wrote songs for The Tigger Movie, they were summarily replaced for the next Pooh film. In the case of Poppins, clearly every courtesy was accorded the score and the two legends who created it. It's especially wonderful to see all three songwriters on screen, two in England, one in California, singing together.<br /><br />For even more detail about the story of the \\"Poppins\\" flight from book to screen to stage, take a look at the massive and beautiful book co-written by expert historian Brian Sibley, \\"Mary Poppins: Anything Can Happen If You Let It.\\"<br /><br />Magnificent stage artwork from the stage version rounds out the new bonus material on the recent DVD, for the info of those who have the earlier versions. Most everything contained in the 40th anniversary edition is still here except for a game and a piece-by-piece reconstruction of a \\"Jolly Holiday\\" excerpt.<br /><br />But it still includes the wonderful audio commentary with Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke and Richard Sherman -- and who wouldn't want to \\"watch\\" the movie with them? My only quibble: a guide folder to the discs would have been nice.<br /><br />And if you still have the single-disc Gold Classic edition, you may want to keep that one because it's the only one with the complete \\"Hollywood Goes to a World Premiere,\\" a short theatrical film with delightfully cheesy narration (\\"the vivacious Annette!\\") as well as the after party audio material. The newer two releases use this footage for a similar bonus, but it's nice to have the original.<br /><br />(By the way, the connection between \\"Superman\\" and \\"Mary Poppins\\" may have seemed a strange juxtaposition, but both of them not only can fly, but they spin around real fast, too!)<br /><br />Whether you feel the new release is worth your while or not, I am pleased to see \\"Mary Poppins\\" reissued as often as possible. This is a very important film, not a relic of the past, and reissuing brings it to the public's attention each time and hopefully introduces it to another legion of fans. Here's to keeping everything higgledy-piggeldy around here!
B0007TKNII|5.0|It has a little bit of everything for those who love music.  It has love, deception, and even some sword fighting, but true love wins in the end.  The music can take you away, and it sticks with you for days after.
B0004Z33EG|3.0|Sylvester Stallone achieved amazing heights during the 80's, along with Arnold Schwarzenegger, especially as a movie character synonymous with the muscled guy who is a pure fighting machine...<br /><br />In Ted Kotcheff's \\"First Blood,\\" John Rambo (Stallone) is a highly decorated Vietnam veteran who was trained specifically as a killing machine... He has come to a quite little town in Oregon, only to visit one of his platoon buddies... He was told that his friend has died, last summer, of cancer...<br /><br />Disheartened, Rambo continues to walk the streets of Hope when he is annoyed by the local Sheriff (Brian Dennehy), and booked for vagrancy and resisting arrest...<br /><br />Beaten, kicked all over, treated like trash, and pushed too far by the other cops in the Sheriff's office, Rambo is taking back to traumatic flashbacks, to the enduring torture in POW camp... Rambo, by that point, fights his way out and wages a one-man war against the police force that escalates out of control... Rambo is seen as a one man army overpowering all the sheriff's deputies and escaping into the surrounding woods...<br /><br />\\"First Blood\\" communicates the rage, the depression, the frustration and the psychological wounds of one Vietnam soldier that fought for his country and was then hassled by it upon his return...<br /><br />But what makes Rambo such a dangerous hero is Brian Dennehy being incredibly efficient as the cruel officer who doesn't like the looks of Stallone... Sure he's the abusive sheriff who is the victim of his environment, but he's also arrogant and incessantly underestimating a man who was 'the best, with guns, with knives, with his bare hands...'<br /><br />Dennehy got a presence of his own pushing an 'expert in guerrilla warfare' at the breaking point...
0784011176|5.0|It's rare that I give a movie 5 stars, but if there were ever a film to deserve one, it's this one.  This film was up against What's Love Got to Do With It and won.  Being a woman of color, I say it was deserved.  From the moment that Ada and her daughter stepped on the beach, I realized that this Piano wasn't just an object, but an extension of the main protagonist.  It was her voice and her way of speaking.  Her husbands' unwillingness to try to understand her need for this piano only helped to broaden the wall between them.  And on that same beach, this ruffian, Baines, was able to experience Ada in a way that her husband wouldn't allow.  THAT was his advantage over Stewart.  He was able to feel her music and understood that she was inextricably linked to the piano. How else could he coerce her into making that \\"bargain\\"?  Why else would she agree to such a thing (and please, let's think beyond the \\"she's a hussy\\" thing).  Though her husband cut her off from her \\"voice\\", it was Baines who reunited her with it...but at a price.<br /><br />I love the fact that no matter what Baines did, he was never able to control Adas' response to him.  Sure, he controlled what she needed most, but she was well aware that she controlled what he needed in return and used it to her advantage (See the recital scene.  Served him right.  You GO, Ada!).  So in the end he caught on, he did the right thing and gave her back her piano...He let her go.  And when he did that, SHE then decided what she needed, not by forced submission or coercion, but of her own free will (which can't be suppressed anyway).<br /><br />I disagree with some people's assertion that Harvey Keitel was \\"miscast\\" in this role.  Many don't find him attractive or classically handsome, so the fact that Ada falls for this very rough looking man instead of her handsome husband seems to speak volumes to beauty being in the eye of the beholder.  Personally, I thought Keitel was extremely masculine and sexy in this movie (and no, not because of the frontal nudity).  There was nothing soft or pretty about him.  It was all rough and tumble, rugged male sensuality and I loved it.  Again, many will dislike this film because of its moral ambiguity or \\"preposterous\\" nature.  I think that a more clean version will appeal to those of a...Puritanical moral sensibility.  I find it refreshing that this movie presented the characters as not being all good or all bad.  They are just people, and that is what I relate to.

Harrah (Robert Mitchum) greets Cole Thornton (John Wayne) with a pointed rifle... Harrah has heard his friend works now for Bart Jason (Edward Asner). Thornton admits Jason offered him good money but he doesn't know what he has to do to earn it...<br /><br />Harrah explains that Jason showed up here around the end of the war with a pocketful of money and nobody could find out where he got it, but everybody else around here was broke... Having money, he started to grow... But now he needs more water... There's only one place to get it... Trouble is somebody was there ahead of him, about 20 years ahead... His name is Kevin MacDonald (R. G. Armstrong).<br /><br />MacDonald got four boys and a girl... All worked real hard... They hung together through the rough times and how things were looking up, MacDonald was not ready to sell... So he's holding and Jason was pushing, and the sheriff was standing right in the middle...<br /><br />Warned that Thornton has gone to Jason's, MacDonald has left his youngest boy out there to do a man's job... He went to sleep... When Cole came by, Luke (Johnny Crawford) woke up, jumped up and started firing his gun... All Cole was seeing was somebody shooting at him from the rocks... Thornton, thinking himself the target, shoots and drops the boy ... Luke explains the error then... To escape the pain of his mortal wound, he kills himself...<br /><br />Thornton takes his body to his fathers' place, and after he explains what happened, his sister, Joey (Michele Carey), a wild cat in buckskin pants who didn't believe him, tried to kill him... Her brother stops her and her father asks her to get in the house...<br /><br />After Thornton leaves the ranch, Joey (Michele Carey) ambushes Cole at a creek, dropping him with her riffle bullet... He manages to get back on his horse and escapes to Maudie's place, where Doc Miller (Paul Fix) treats him... The bullet was dangerous up against his spine, however, as Doc advises him to find a better surgeon for the bullet's removal...<br /><br />After a short time, Thornton leaves El Dorado...<br /><br />One of the best moments in the film came in a Cantina near the Mexican border when James Caan (Mississippi) enters the place and calls one of four men sitting at a dinner table, reminding him if he remembers him or if he remembers the blue hat he is wearing? Mississippi says he caught up with his other three companions and he killed them all, and that he was the last of the four... He asks him to stand up... and as the audience observed, Mississippi wasn't wearing, at all, any gun...<br /><br />Obviously, when Jason just brought his outfit into town, the action started...<br /><br />Robert Mitchum is 'the tin star with a drunk pinned on it.' He was too mad to be scared and too sick to worry about it..<br /><br />Charlene Holt plays Maudie the gambler's widow who throws her arms around Cole, sees Harrah, and bursts out laughing when she finds her old flame and her current one are friends... She tells the sheriff that Cole gave her a stake, and helped her get on her feet...<br /><br />Michele Carey plays Joey, the wild girl who thinks that Mississippi looks a lot better without that silly hat...<br /><br />Christopher George plays Nelse McLeod, a dark, thin-faced man with a scar on his eye...<br /><br />\\"El Dorado\\" was the third of four Westerns that Howard Hawks made with John Wayne...

B00006CXSS|5.0|BAND OF BROTHERS is the best war genre mini series ever made. The story of East Company, a squadron of paratroopers, from their training in boot camp to the many horrors of war. Tom Hank's acting is superb, the story compelling and realistic to the point of being painful to watch at certain times, and art direction spot on. This series is a grim and compelling reminder of the sacrifices our service men made in WWII. It is simply put, FANTASTIC.
B000RF7XYO|4.0|And Elizabeth did whisper Robert Dudley's name on her deathbed... The movie is an imaginative interpretation of the way that things could have been...<br /><br />Shekhar Kapur's film explores the instabilities of her reign, and the absolute horror and terror that surrounded the early part of her royal office without neglecting her relationship with her terminally ill sister... So it's a glimpse of her girlhood into statehood, and the shedding that occurs, with the people who expended in her life along the way...<br /><br />The film shows Elizabeth growing up in an incredibly unstable, tumultuous environment... But she's an absolute survivor... Someone who has got no solid ground on which she walks... So one minute she's a bastard, the next minute she's a princess, then one moment she's an illegitimate daughter, then she's a queen... And it's a very relevant period of her life, because she was 25 when she became a female monarch...<br /><br />There are four men in Elizabeth's life and all have quite different influences on what it means for a young woman to run the country so young, given that she comes to the throne under very difficult political circumstances...<br /><br />There's Sir Cecil (Attenborough) who's from an older regime giving her the traditions and the conventions that are the most orthodox; Sir Francis (Geoffrey Rush) Elizabeth's great spy master, very astute, almost puritanical and rather dry bureaucrat; Robert Dudley (Fiennes) with whom the film suggests that she has quite a passionate, private relationship; and Norfolk (Eccleston), a major rival who doesn't regard that she is suitable to rule his England...<br /><br />The motion picture succeeds in developing Elizabeth's change and, basically, locks off parts of herself, and dehumanizes herself in order to wield her power among men...
B000O5AYCA|4.0|THE NATIONAL never did it for me with their album [[ASIN:B0007LCNKM ALLIGATOR]] and I was hesitant to give them another try with BOXER. I'm very glad that I did. The deep baritone of Matt Berninger, who sounds a bit like Nick Cave, is the perfect accompaniment to this austere but complex music.<br /><br />I did find myself wishing the band would rock out a bit more, as all the songs are pretty down tempo. The best thing about this album are the lyrics, which are able to convey mood perfectly, be it long suffering love, fear, or even the melancholic subtleties of memory. This an adult album, as far from pop as you can get, with themes that resonate with me on a deep level. This music can be like therapy, in the same way as [[ASIN:B0007XT87G Deadwing]] by Porcupine Tree (although a very different musical style).<br /><br />Recommended to those who like their music to mean something and to have an emotional depth beyond \\"I'm really mad about stuff\\" or \\"I really want to get with him/her.\\" These songs have the dynamic of fine literature, right down to their slower pacing.<br /><br />My favorite tracks are:<br /><br />1. Fake Empire<br />2. Slow Show<br />3. Start a War<br />4. Ada<br /><br />4.5/5 Stars. One of the best albums I've heard in a while.
B00007KLJJ|3.0|The story is set in 1884 during the British Empire uprising...<br /><br />Harry Faversham (Heath Ledger) is a young army officer from a distinguished military family who never wanted to join the army... He did it for his father... He resigns his commission on the eve of his regiment's departure for Sudan... Harry has already disgusted his strict father, a respected General in the Queen's Army, by declaring no interest in a soldier's life and now that he is about to be married to his beloved Ethne (Kate Hudson), he wants to settle down...<br /><br />When his closest friends and fellow officers find out that he disgraced the regiment, they send him a box of feathers of cowardice... When Ethne sends him another feather, he then disappears to redeem himself, to face up to his fears, to discover himself, to win back his self-respect...<br /><br />Shekhar Kapur's \\"The Four Feathers\\" is beautifully filmed and performed... The themes of love, honor, loyalty, friendship, trust, redemption, wisdom, true strength, and true courage are all there... They made the characters entirely plausible... But what truly lingers in the memory about it are the stunning sequences filmed in the Sudan and the splendid staging of several battles, showing the then standard British tactics employed in holding off attackers--the forming of squares, with riflemen deployed in standing, kneeling, firing, holding line, and keeping eye on the target... These exciting scenes of combat and carnage are truly impressive...
B00000IMYA|2.0|Perhaps the people giving positive reviews have sentimental feelings toward another (mono) recording of this concert, or perhaps they aren't listening on a true hifi stereo.  I personally feel the engineering attempt to make a stereo recording out of two mono recordings was a failure and it detracts from the amazing performance of the Ellington band.      Just as I would settle in and close my eyes to enjoy a tune, the drums start bouncing from left to right, the soloists appear to be jumping across the stage when they change their dynamics.  Sounds cut in and out.  It is annoying and that's all I end up thinking about when I listen to this album.  In fact, I've thought about it so much, I think I came to the conclusion that it sounds like 3 mics are in use, Two correctly placed above the band producing a somewhat muddled stereo recording, and one solo mic out front that is much cleaner.  This might have been fine except whenever music gets picked up by the solo mic (piano, drums, solists) the sound comes entirely out of my left speaker.  Had they centered that mic in the mix it would have been a much more enjoyable experience.  I think I'm going to switch my stereo to mono and have another listen.      For those looking for an excellent recording of Ellingtion, I recommend \\"Live at the Blue Note\\" recorded August 9, 1959.  I know it's not \\"THE NEWPORT\\" recording, but you'll enjoy it much more on your B&Ws.  If you're just looking for something to listen to on your Bose wave radio...well I'm sure this recording will suit you just fine.

B001NFNFNU|5.0|Changeling is a gripping movie for adults - 'manna for grown ups' as one reviewer rightly called it. Angelina Jolie turns in a terrific performance as Christine Collins, a demure single mother in 1920's Los Angeles whose missing son becomes a rallying point for the oppressed citizens of LA suffering under the boot of a ruthlessly corrupt police force & mayoralty.     But there's a big twist in the tale when, in a parallel storyline, another young boy is arrested on a routine deportation case & does he have a story to tell. A tale so horrifying that it would instantly qualify as every parents worst nightmare. When I saw this film in the cinema the packed out audience gasped - literally gasped out loud - during the scene between the kid & the police officer.    Jolie has never been quite this good & she brings a fantastic larger than life movie star presence to her role. She's a terrific actress in the body of a goddess & watching her evokes so much of the spirit of a Rita Hayworth or a Joan Crawford in their luminous prime. But she's not the only star here. One of the great pleasures of Changeling is watching so many unknown character actors given the chance to strut their stuff & boy do they take it.     The script is just as outstanding, moving effortlessly from one genre to another - part period crime thriller, part serial killer movie, part psycho ward drama, part courtroom procedural. It begins small & then unexpectedly expands to take in political corruption, the status of women, the way children & adults view the same event, & the satisfaction (or not) of capital punishment. What's most impressive is the way Clint Eastwood orchestrates all of this because Changeling shifts gears so smoothly that one remains completely transfixed, indeed amazed, throughout.     There's also a real sense of anger here as Eastwood leaves us in no doubt how he feels about the way Collins - & others like her - were treated by the authorities. As much as Changeling is a hugely enjoyable picture it carries a genuine contemporary resonance as a cautionary tale.     Amazon's editorial review suggests the film goes on to long & sags in the final stretch. I couldn't disagree more. In fact I think this is one of the best edited movies I have seen in a long while. The multiple storylines & shifting emotional moods are so well captured by Joel Cox & Gary Roach's editing that they deserved an Oscar nomination. The technical aspects are top notch throughout & how pleasing it is to see a period piece in which the sets & costumes never once overwhelm the characters or the story. Eastwood's lovely score is the icing on the cake.    Changeling was the first of two masterful Eastwood movies in 2008, the other being Gran Torino. Both come highly recommended for those hungering for movies the way they used to make 'em (& I mean that in the best possible sense).
0132350882|5.0|Since the rise of Design Patterns in the 90s, there has been a scarcity of books focused solely on good code. Good design with bad code is...bad code.     This book contains a large number of specific guidelines about writing good code. Design is intimately involved, but the focus is on the code itself. The advice is explained by before/after snippets of code to show the effect of applying the advice.     Near the end of the book are several longer sections where the author drives us through cleaning up some available open source code.     This is a great replacement for _Code Complete_.     Very easy to read (surprising for a book on code)...

B00006CXSS|5.0|I can't say that watching this show was like being there, because unless you actually were there there's certainly no way to know what it was really like!  Nevertheless, this is an outstanding series of stories about WWII in Europe and the men that fought there.<br /><br />I was introduced to this series only about 6 months ago, but I have already watched this entire series through more than a few times.<br /><br />The storylines are engaing, the characters and acting are top-notch, and the staging, filming, and effects are excellent.<br /><br />The feelings of fighting men, their commitment to each other, their willngness to sacrifice for each other, and their unwillingness to let a comrade down come across in a crystal clear fashion.  It has been said that fighting men do not usually do what they do for home or country (though that's usually in the mix), but they do what they do in order to support their brothers in arms.  That impression and sentiment is made and strengthened throughout the entire series.<br /><br />This is a series worth watching over and over.  It repesents what is best about our country and those that put themselves in harm's way to defend it (and us).<br /><br />I'd like to express sincere thanks to the writers, producers, and actors, but most especially to those who fought and lived and those who fought and died.  We all owe you a great debt.  Thank you!

1594201927|5.0|There are few books that you read in your life time that can be as impactful as this one, at least for me.      Being interested in both history and finance (with the current financial crisis especially stirring up my interest lately), I find this book great in documenting the financial sub-plots during history.  There's so much to be learned from history, esp when it concerns your money.  It was interesting to see that even highly intelligent people like the Nobel laureates running LTCM forget that fact, using historical data that don't go back long enough for their mathematical model...  a lesson for all of us, and a reminder that economics always has a human aspect to it that maybe impossible to be captured by mathematics.    I love how the author describes the major financial pillars from credit market, bond market, stock market, insurance market, real-estate, to derivatives, and show how they interconnect.  I also love the spread of major financial figures (famous or infamous) throughout history and their biographies.  It really helped me (someone who wasn't a economics major) to understand finance.  It's really amazing the financial ingenuity throughout human history, and the people leading the finance world (with their money).    The author also did a good job of describing the causes of the current financial crisis: China's excessive buying of US bonds which props up bond prices which encourages even more bonds to be created, out of risky, sub-prime borrowers in the form of Collatorial Debt Obligation that's flooded all over the world infecting other countries, when the risky borrowers indeed couldn't make their payments; it was a scary chain-reaction and butterfly effect with political folley along the way (like Bush's push for more property-owning democracy by encouraging relaxed lending standards through HUD and Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac).  It seemed as if all the stars lined up for this financial crisis to happen...    I have greatly benefited from this book, and feel I'm a much better investor, have a better understanding of finance, and have a better understanding of politics as a result, e.g., the govt's policies and their economic impact, which also makes me a better citizen when it comes time to vote.    I HIGHLY recommend this book.

B000XVT7SW|5.0|With rare exception, I not a fan of operas made into movies,   preferring filmed live performances. Well...this is that rare   exception! It is, by far, the best version of \\"Cavalleria\\" I've   ever seen. The cast was exceptionally well chosen; Cossotto,   Cecchele, Guelfi, DiStasio, and Martino were perfectly cast as   Santuzza, Turiddu, Alfio, Mamma Lucia, and Lola.     Although well sung and well acted by the entire cast, this is   Santuzza's story and Fiorenza Cossotto has just nailed the role.   This was filmed in 1968 when Cossotto was about 32, so she was   young enough to look convincing in the close ups. I believe the   singing was dubbed (which bothers some people), but it was so   beautifully sung, I hardly noticed. Just hearing and seeing   Fiorenza Cossotto singing \\"Inneggiamo,\\" \\"Voi lo sapete,\\" and   Santuzza's duet with Turiddu is worth the purchase price!    Cecchele is appropriately unsympathetic as Turiddu   (I've always felt Placido Domingo was too much of   a gentleman to play Turiddu convincingly), and Martino   is wonderful as the spiteful  Lola. Di Stasio, as   Mamma Lucia, is perfect...right out of central casting.   Guelfi, too, looks and acts a convincing Alfio...and   what a voice!       Most reviews have concentrated on \\"Pagliacci\\" and I don't have  much to add. Yes, it was a fabulous performance...how could it  not be with Vickers, Kabaivanska, and Glossop? However, I don't  think \\"Pag\\" works as well in a movie format. I would have pre-  ferred seeing this extraordinary performance filmed live.
B001P9KR8U|4.0|Superficially, this might have been a feelgood movie about a diligent boy rising from the ghetto, getting fabulously rich, and never forgetting the girl he left behind. That's not this movie.<br /><br />This takes any Dickensian poverty you might have imagined and brings it completely up to date. It starts with Jamal orphaned by lethal sectarian violence, his childhood friend turning to guns and violence, his cute little female friend turned into - well, you get the picture. Every event leaves its mark on him, and he learns from it. The odd smattering of stray facts earns him a place on a game show with multi-million rupee payoff. And, in a coincidence that stretches imagination, every one of the game's questions has answers in his haunted past. Almost every one ...<br /><br />I liked this one a lot more than I thought I would, largely because of the child actors. The several girls playing Latika at different ages, especially, are heart-breakingly cute - and especially heart-breaking when seen in that cesspool of poverty. The way it documents the poverty of that underclass, the \\"slumdogs,\\" will outrage any thinking, feeling viewer. In an ending that's really a beginning, Jamal rises above that poverty, and above the corrupt and vicious society at the top, too.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters<br /><br />PS: Hang around through the closing credits - it offers one more light moment, as if to brighten the movie's darker imagery.

B001KMB6X2|4.0|I can't say this film is an Oscar winner, but it is not as bad as many reviewers indicate. The problem with the movie is that it has a poor delivery; i personally think it lacked a bit more action. The concept and the idea of future world are great, but you need more detail, more story line, and that is where it fails. Perhaps if maybe another director would have taken a shot at it, it could have been broader, better. We have to understand that are tons of great concept movies with a bad delivery, this is one of them. The movie is not total garbage, it's worth the rent, go check it out.

1416585710|4.0|I feel that this whole book was a product of King imagining what his wife might go through after his death--of course with the supernatural stuff thrown in.  Not my favorite King novel, but it gives an insight about how highly he thinks of his wife and how he tries to explain the art of writing. Maybe his close call with death made him reflect on his own demise and what really ends up being important to us, which is our soul mate. [[ASIN:1604941987 Power Path to Love]]
0316017922|2.0|I read this on a flight to Australia, and chased it with \\"The Black Swan\\", which makes for an effective rebuttal of \\"Outliers\\".<br /><br />The thesis of Outliers appears to be \\"nobody succeeds in a vacuum\\", \\"practice a lot to get good\\", and \\"interpersonal skills and emotional intelligence are more useful than IQ for succeeding in business and life\\".  It would be ok if he would leave it at that, but he ruins it by trying to show that the various sucess stories, the \\"Outliers\\" of the title, who succeed extremely well, did succeed more from a lucky environment than their own merit.<br /><br />He does this by appearing to examine the historical environments of those success stories, and shows that Of Course this person succeeded, or at least Of Course someone like this person would succeed here, because there was some lucky combination of extrinsic factors driving that success.<br /><br />The problem is that he demonstrates that \\"Of Course\\" after that fact.  Any thing is obvious after the face.<br /><br />Chasing this book with \\"The Black Swan\\" is very effective, because one of the points of that books is that Black Swans, game changing item that disrupt the old order, are always very obvious in retrospect, and impossible to accurately predict or even expect looking forward, other than there will also be \\"rare\\" events that change the game.
B00012QLQ4|5.0|Having read the complete manga by Katsuhiro Otomo gives you a jump start on the film itself. The film keeps up to it, even though it crops the latter half of the manga... They would have had to do almost six hours of footage.    Nonetheless, Akira is one of the greatest animated feature films of all times. Not quite a fan of american dub in general, but the original japanese version leaves a masterful testimony, that the film is painstakingly meticulous and detailed; that you could swear that the words are really coming out of the characters' mouth.    Having seen four versions of the film (Mexican Spanish, Castilian Spanish, English and Japanese), I'd have to say that this version is all worth it, even when spanish speakers like myself are used to the Mexican dub. Akira is worth all the way, in all the languages.
031606792X|5.0|The twilight saga is an amazing 4 book series. Breaking Dawn is the last book of the saga. It sums up everything for Bella & Edward. If you love the characters as such as I do, you will always want to know more, but it completes the series in the best way. I do not want to say anything that could possible give anything away. Just sit back and enjoy your self!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I started printing off Jillian's exercises off the internet before I finally bought this DVD.  I love it!  You can move from Level to Level if you get bored with one level, just adjust the exercise if one is too much (for example, if you are in level 2 and cannot double jump rope, just single jump).  I travel about 4 days a week.  Whenever I cannot make myself get to the workout room in the hotel, I can just plug this DVD into my little portable DVD and get in a quick workout right in my hotel room.  Jillian is a great motivator!!

It does not have the spirit nor the LOOK of the Toho original classic Japanese Godzilla.     If a studio is going to make a film about a classic monster, due some research first and be respectful toward the character and his meaning and symbolism.     Want to see a Real Godzilla movie, go watch original Godzilla (1954) and of course watch GODZILLA, MOTHRA, KING GHIDORAH: GIANT MONSTERS ALL OUT ATTACK.

B0018CWEYY|5.0|I'm not sure why I didn't write a review of LOST Season 4 earlier, but better late than never.  I did finish rewatching Season 4 (this time on Blu-ray) shortly before the beginning of Season 4.  Let me just add that watching it on Blu-ray brought a whole new level of appreciation for it.  It was so good that I plan on buying the rest of the series - even the earlier seasons - on Blu-ray as they become available (at the moment I think only Season 3 is also available).  Though it is a tad disconcerting seeing every bit of Locke's stubble and every hair at the top of Jeff Fahey's chest.<br /><br />I have been surprised in talking with people how many of them - not viewers of the show - are laboring under the impression that LOST started off great but then got bad and has stayed bad.  Not true!  LOST started off great, then stayed good in Season 2, though it had a tendency to lose focus of the overarching story.  Then it got very bad at the beginning of Season 3 before correcting course, tightening up the narrative pace, and then got in Season 4 as good as it has ever been.  And for the record, so far in Season 5 it appears in little danger of losing its way again.  What happened, I believe, is that when LOST became a megahit in Season 1, ABC encouraged the two boss men of LOST, Damon Lindelhof and Carlton Cuse, to slow the story down so as to be able to stretch the show out over 7 or 8 seasons.  But after the intense fan anger over the first six - and very uninspiring - they decided to stop dawdling and start giving the fans more answers than mysteries.  After Season 3 Lindelhof and Cuse announced that there would be only three more seasons, each of them 16 episodes in length, and all of them shown without any weeks off between episodes.  This schedule was upset somewhat by the writers' strike.  As a result, Season 4 was somewhat shorter than they intended, something that will be made up by expanding Seasons 5 and 6 by an episode each.<br /><br />If Season 1 of LOST was about the island, Season 2 about the hatch, and Season 3 about the Others, then Season 4 was about the boat that appeared at the end of Season 3.  Something that is easy to miss is what a brief period of time Season 4 encompasses.  From the moment that the boat appears until the island is \\"moved,\\" only a week or so occurs.  The final episode's final minutes then allow several days on Penny's boat before the Oceanic Six show up in civilization again.<br /><br /> After the shocking end of Season 3, the narrative of LOST altered significantly.  The first three seasons, with the lone exception of Desmond, focused on flashbacks in the lives of the various inhabitants on the island.  But after the flash forward that ended Season 3, most of the narratives of the various individuals consisted of flash forwards, the major exception being, once again, Desmond.  His episode, perhaps the finest episode of the season, \\"The Constant,\\" showed him, like Billy Pilgrim, becoming unstuck in time.  [The flash-forward that ended Season 3 occasioned, by the way, a bit of controversy.  After BATTLESTAR GALACTICA's Season Two ended with a flash forward, Damon Lindelhof was asked explicitly in a Q&A if LOST would ever do that.  He said that they would not, even though he already knew that they intended to do precisely that.  Some fans were upset that he lied to them.  But hey!  What was he supposed to do, say that they were going to flash forward in the season finale?  Where would have been the fun in that?]<br /><br />Season 4 saw the introduction of several new characters.  The four most significant were the ones who came to the island on a helicopter from the boat.  Daniel Faraday (played marvelously by Jeremy Davies) is a physicist who knows a surprising amount about time travel.  Charlotte Lewis [LOST has a stunning number of characters - both major and minor - named after prominent British intellectuals; Charlotte is named quite explicitly after C. S. Lewis, her full name being Charlotte Staples Lewis and his Clive Staples Lewis, but as in most of the other instances, there does not seem to be any discernible correlation between the character's name and the person for whom she is named] is another scientist who obviously cares for Daniel.  Ken Leung plays Miles, a clearly untrustworthy soul who possesses an unusual link with the dead.  Finally, Jeff Fahey plays Frank Lapidus, a helicopter pilot who seems to be one of the good guys.  Back on the boat, the bad guys are headed by the villainous Martin Keamy, played by Kevin Durand (interestingly, perhaps best known for a role on DARK ANGEL for which he is almost impossible to recognize:  he played Joshua aka Dog Boy, Max Guevera's \\"Big Brother,\\" on Season Two, a role that required major prostheses).<br /><br />The season introduced many new questions while answering many others.  For instance, in the time traveling episode in which Desmond keeps getting taken back in time, Daniel explains that to break the cycle he needs a \\"constant,\\" which in his case turns out to be Penny.  This leads to perhaps the best scene of the season - heck, one of the greatest scenes in the whole series - as Desmond, moving back and forth in time, frantically tells Penny to answer his phone call on Christmas Eve, 2004.  When she answered the phone and they profess their love to one another, I was simply overcome with emotion.  The mystery occurs a few minutes later, when Daniel is seen back on the island, his notebook in hand.  Opening it to a passage he wrote many years earlier, we read over his shoulder the words, \\"If anything goes wrong, Desmond Hume is my constant.\\"  Say huh?<br /><br />All in all, this was a spectacular season.  One only hopes that the ending will be as good as the individual seasons have been.  Like BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, the eventual judgment on the show will be whether the story as a whole stands up.  These two shows are unique in that the entire series will end up telling a single story (much the same was true of BABYLON 5, though network interference caused what was supposed to be a five-season story get wrapped up at the end of Season 4, only to have the show unexpectedly renewed for a fifth season, by which time it was too late to adhere to the original plan).  Now, I think LOST, like BSG, will be a good series even if the ending is disappointing.  But like BSG, if the ending isn't strong, then it will undercut the previous six seasons (BSG still has seven final episodes as I write this, but so far it looks like it is going to end spectacularly well).  If it ends well, I think LOST is going to go down as one of the best series in the history of TV, just as I think BATTLESTAR GALACTICA will.  Unfortunately, I think these two magnificent shows will end up exceptions and not the rule.  Networks hate long, sustained narratives.  They love standalone episodes.  BSG and LOST are both complex serial dramas, while the networks was series to be as episodic as possible.  That makes it easier for potential viewers who have not seen prior episodes to jump in at any point.  But for viewers there is absolutely no question about the superiority of the serial format.  LOST and BSG provide viewing experiences that not only make them superior to other TV shows, but to any movies that one can see.  I hope that we will see more long narratives like these two shows.  But if we don't, that will show just how very, very special they both are.Clive Staples Lewis, but as in most of the other instances, there does not seem to be any discernible correlation between the character's name and the person for whom she is named] is another scientist who obviously cares for Daniel.

B000MV90IU|3.0|Still a great movie.  Even on my 50\\" 1080P plasma, the blu-ray version adds, but doesn't add significantly, to this action packed movie presentation. Projecting it on my neighbor's 90\\" screen does the trick. WOW!  You've never felt it like that since you saw it at the movies.
068484267X|4.0|Many times as I was reading this book, I wanted to put it down.  Angela's Ashes is not a happy story.  In fact, the abject poverty, squalor, desperation and death make it downright depressing.  But it is masterfully told.  McCourt's first person writing style is real, genuine and so you feel along with the protagonist:  abandonment, disappointment, shame, grief, anger, betrayal but also hope and joy and pleasure in the simplest things.  The turning point is when Frank finally decides to forget about his father, a drunk who abandons his family, and become a man.  The story becomes more poignant as we watch Frank struggle to transform himself. As the story ends, though, the reader gets a sense that life is going to be better (the protagonist finally makes it back to America after scrimping and scrounging and working his \\"arse\\" off to pay the fare.  He feels in America he'll be able to do great things and the reader hopes so much that \\"'tis\\".*

0316168815|5.0|I never thought a book about rape and murder would turn out to be such an enjoyable read. To be sure, the story, about a 14-year-old girl's rape and murder by the neighborhood sociopath, is very tragic.... I knew it would happen, and in fact, the murder takes place in the very beginning, yet I kept thinking, \\"No! Do NOT follow that man!\\"<br /><br />The rest of the story, in which Susie watches as her family disintegrates and repairs itself, and her friends come to terms with her death, is sad also, but sometimes funny and eventually uplifting. Because she can see and hear all everything that goes on in the characters' lives, as well as read their thoughts, each person in the story becomes someone complex and fascinating to follow.<br /><br />Through her eyes, her killer's story unfolds with such sensitivity that I felt both repulsion and sympathy, often within the same paragraph.<br /><br />Though you have to take into account your own beliefs of the afterlife, the story is organic and true-to-life. For the most part, her \\"hauntings\\" of the people on earth are felt only in the brush of air or a very strong memory- things we normally feel when a loved one dies. There is only one scene, toward the end, in which the rules of life and death bend and something miraculous happens for the sake of drama. I'm still not sure how I feel about it. I like it for the sake of the story-telling, but it doesn't match the rest of the book, in which most of the action was believable.<br /><br />But I can forgive this one little misstep by Alice Sebold, because the rest of the story left me so warm. If I had to describe this book in one word, Warm is what it would be. And I defy anyone to read the last four sentences and not be a total mess

B001DUJNGS|5.0|Voyager was Enigma's most underrated CD. I challenge anyone who claims to not like it to turn the lights off, turn the music up loud, and pour a glass of red wine (or your preferred equivalent :))    This is a great CD-Vocal songs are much more hard hitting that A Posteriori-it is great that Andru Donalds is back in classic form. He literally carries the 2nd song (Seven Lives). Much more MUSIC and much less space than A Posteriori-with especially hard hitting vocals on The Same Parents and Distorted Love.    Great instrumentation throughout-a return to more classical elements, but with minimal Gegorian chant, which is fine. If I want more, I listen to MCMXC A.D.    As with Voyager-if you say you don't like it-you need to turn off the lights and turn the volume up. This is easily in Enigma's top three CDs.    I am thankful that it IS different than early Enigma. Artists that don't expand seem to go away and I want Michael Cretu to be around for a while.

But trust me, whether you love Twilight or not, do not allow yourself to be tricked into this horrible book (and series).<br /><br />The writing is elementary, crude, and superficial.  The main characer of this story is no Bella (and not in a good way).  All of the supporting characters and love interests are vapid and two-dimensional.  They are simply not likeable.<br /><br />And if you thought sparkling vampires were lame (I actually quite liked the sparkling effect!), the vampires in this book are exceedingly unattractive.  They are basically annoying teenagers with ugly tattoos.  The end.<br /><br />If you MUST read all published teenage vampire fiction, than check this out from the library with low expectations.  Otherwise, take the high road and read some brilliant young adult vampire fiction by L.J. Smith.  Any of her Vampire Diaries and Nightworld series!

I hate the trips - that is why I buy thru the internet.  I have yet to find time - and willingness - to go to the p.o.  Defeats the very reason I buy with convenience thru the web.    I like that amazon shows a note when I order that I've purchased the product before - found out I already bought the cd 2 years ago.  Good thing I didn't order that and a whole bunch more that I forgot I already have.  Got to track down what I have already.  So I like that little reminder.  Kudos to amazon.
1588167461|2.0|I own this book, and i learned valuable things from it. Like how to properly shave, why cedar shoe stretchers are needed to keep your shoes in good shape, an overview of the different types of cuff styles, paints styles, collar styles etc. It even tells you what your wardobe should consist of to cover all situations.    That part of the book is awesome!    But, i am giving it a poor rating because the author uses celebrity figures from the 1950's to early 1980's to define the style. And most of those styles are not the Armani suits you see business executives wear today!    Let me clarify. He shows Ronald Reagan in his younger acting days, wearing Jeans. He shows Pee-Wee Herman wearing the classing bowtie suit. He shows George Burns, Carey Grant, and countless others and explains their styles in detail. But, those styles are long outdated.    Sure, I find Carey Grant or Dean Martin one of the best dressed in the older era. And their styles can still be used today. But, most of the others are so wrong today!    Today, Men admire the likes of Daniel Craig from Casino Royale, with his J Crew Windsow Tuxedo Shirt, Polo Ralph Lauren Bowtie, and Armani Collezioni two-piece tuxedo.     Even the hair styles and facial hair in this book are long outdated. People today wear short hair cuts.

0805079831|2.0|Naomi Klein has a theory, which I'd sum up as: \\"a certain type of capitalism takes advantage of shocks\\". I find this theory intriguing. Unfortunately, she often attempts to apply it without regard to reality.    The tsunami in South-East Asia, the economic shock therapy in Eastern Europe after 1989, electric shocks used to torture opposition by Pinochet's regime in Chile, the Tiananmen Square massacre in China: these are all nails that Klein is hammering on with her theory. In her mind, all of them fit into the same scheme, a sort of conspiracy to force free market capitalism onto people. She even devotes a chapter to electro-shock therapy used to treat schizophrenia and mental depression and misused in brainwashing experiments. I guess anything that has \\"shock\\" in its name is fair game...    A short Internet search revealed that the fact that Klein grossly misrepresented the meaning and effects of the Tiananmen Square massacre is well established so I won't go into that.    On the other hand, I happened to be living in Eastern Europe during the \\"shock therapy\\" that Klein describes and I don't know anyone who interpreted this term the way she does. To us, this simply meant that the price level that was artificially low prior to 1989 had to be adjusted to the prices of the free market. And it was a \\"shock\\" in the sense that the population had to wake up to the new reality, not in the sense that someone wanted the population dazed so that they can be exploited.    Then I read the following on page 248 of the book: \\"[Jeffrey Sachs] now disavows [the term \\"shock therapy\\"], claiming he was referring only to narrow pricing policies, not wholesale country makeovers.\\" I have to give credit to Klein that she mentions this at all, but I find it disturbing that she makes it sound like Sachs is basically lying while his account matches perfectly with my personal experience. This, in my eye, casts serious doubt on all of her other claims and cost her one star in rating.    The second star was gone when it became clear that facts and opinions are routinely presented without clear delineation as to which is which. Klein describes many events that I don't have reason to doubt but then in the same breath she provides an interpretation of what that event meant, or an interpretation of the motives of the people involved, which is often questionable.    Finally, I settled on a 2-star rating when Hugo Chavez was presented as a potential alternative to free market capitalism. I may be biased but I cannot accept this.    Having said all that, I would not discourage you from reading this book. I would not suggest that you buy it as I doubt that you would want to keep it on your bookshelf for years to come, but if you are curious and can borrow it from a friend or get it from a library then go for it.    I would also recommend the 2- and 3-star reviews on Amazon, most of which provide a detailed and balanced evaluation.
0385338732|5.0|I absolutely love Sophie Kinsella's work and I was thrilled to read \\"Remember Me?\\" recently.  Like all of Kinsella's main characters, Lexie will pull you into her world and you'll feel like you're right there with her as she tries to remember everything that she's forgotten as a result of her amnesia.  The situations are hilarious just like those of Kinsella's other main characters in other books.

B000TCEU4Q|5.0|I have been a fan of computer flight simulation for about 5 years and loved every minute. I had one problem though, I would sit on the runway waiting for the plane to take off never understanding that I needed to rev up the engine, set the propeller RPM and fuel mixture until the plane got enough speed to take off. What a bore! But then I got these cool controls and away I went...into the sky.     Not really folks but this is by way of showing that these controls are the perfect thing for simulating these controls when you want to simulate the throttle, prop, and mixture controls of an airplane. They look good, work good, and also provide 6 clicker switches to map to other controls. I have these controls mapped to autopilot controls.    The device simply plugs into an available USB port but you will have to tell your game (flight simulator) how to use the levers and buttons but this is just like any other controller you might have. So after a little reading up with the help or Saitek web forums it's easy.    And if you are as big a dumb bell as I am they look cool anyway and if you are as old as I am, your grandkids will have fun playing with the. Pretty solid so you shouldn't worry.    Greg

B001LF4IA6|5.0|I was rather surprised with all the mixed reviews... so I listened to this at least 10 times before giving my thumbs-up review. I see what others mean by the \\"low production\\" value of the album - well, true that it doesn't have an amazing 5.1 mix to knock your socks off, but stylistically I don't think that was Bruce's intention. It has a sort-of-feel of the more simple mono days of years ago, and most important is the quality of the songs, which is terrific. One thing I never bought into is comparing an artist's work with their previous ones. What's the point in that? A piece should stand well on its own, and if it's different than the previous ones, even better. If you're going to listen to this album and constantly compare it to his old albums, then skip it and enjoy the old stuff. But if you allow the new music to take on a new life of its own, there's a high likelihood you will like it! (Note: The Wrestler is an edited version, my guess is for the suits to get people to buy the soundtrack for the full version)
B001JNNDGA|5.0|Watching this re-telling each year has become a Paschal tradition for my family. It is the perfect way to begin Lent reflective of God's ultimate suffering and loving sacrifice as He dwelt in the flesh among us. From that place of genuine sombreness, I can emerge with pure joy at His resurrection when we celebrate at Easter.
0061564893|4.0|I read this book without knowing much about Chinese history or the controversies around Zheng He's voyages. However, I found this book a very interesting read, and certainly raised my eyebrows.    Although I do believe that the Chinese did discover some parts of the world before the Europeans as a result of reading this book, I think that to say they circumnavigated the whole world is a bit of a stretch. It does at times seem like Menzies is using his imagination quite a bit. Menzies is certainly very enthusiastic about this project and has gathered a lot of evidence to support his claims. I definitely like some of the arguments he has put forward (some of this thoughts actually match mine). However, other arguments sometimes wasn't as convincing.    In regards to the content of the book, the introduction gave a good background to the events which occurred in the book. His explanations of how people back then navigated around the world (based on stars) was very interesting to me. Menzies attempts to be as accurate as possible with estimated numbers, such as the time taken to travel to places. The maps and illustrations provided were also very useful and interesting.    I would encourage the reader to read this book critically and with an open mind. Afterwards, make up your own mind. You will also find a lot of information about this book if you do a search on the internet.
0765350386|3.0|I liked the plot and setting of the book.  Brandon Sanderson is like your Michael Crichton or such, where he weaves a nice tale but the characters are lacking.  So, if he could improve on that, and also his vocabulary (I can't count the number of times someone \\"paled\\" in this book) then this series has places to go!
034544678X|4.0|I found the first part of the book very interesting as she explains the differences in innate behavior between humans and dogs.  It provides a lot of insight really.  Towards the end of the book she wanders off topic a bit.  There wasn't a lot of practical advice on training dogs, but there were enough useful tips that I would recommend it to others interested in training their dogs.<br /><br />Her writing style is easily accessable.  Although she approaches the subject from a scientific standpoint, she doesn't write in the elitist way of many PhDs that I have encountered.
B000VR824S|5.0|It doesn't get any better than this...a collection of some of the finest guitarists in the world.  Derek Trucks never ceases to amaze me with his slide guitar work and Sonny Landreth is just simply awesome!!  This is all in the first part of a 2 CD set.  The rest is just as spectacular...
031606792X|5.0|Excellent series.  I am lost now that I have finished the series.  :)  Can't wait for the movies to come out.
B0000C3I6U|5.0|great then great now just special edition anniversary 25th<br /><br />thanks for the fast S.H LARZ
B001EOQWEO|5.0|a movie that might make kids think about the environment, while having fun watching it. Awesome.An added perk. Presto, the animated short is laugh you butt off funny.
B001GCUNVW|5.0|It's a real testament to just how lame the Academy Awards have become that an idiotic piece of trip like Benjamin Button gets nominated for Best Picture, but The Wrestler is overlooked. Mickey Rourke fully deserved his Oscar nomination in a role that challenges Raging Bull as the best use of athletics as a metaphor for deeper human issues.<br /><br />I found the ending sober, truthful, and redemptive -- in the sense that it showed a real human being reacting in a believable way to the irrationality of life and the rewarding, yet difficult task of having meaningful relationships with other human beings. It doesn't take much imagination to realize that we all make bad decisions in our lives -- the decisions that keep us in bad marriages (and maybe put us there), decisions that reflect choices that we later regret (like spending more time at the office than with our children, or being dishonest rather than confront a painful issue), or decisions that get derailed by illness, handicap, or subconscious motivations. Just because \\"the Ram\\" makes some rather large mistakes, they are little different in kind and spirit from the mistakes that all of us with some frequency. Ram is the athlete as metaphor -- facing the abyss when his body wears out. Provided we don't beat our bodies to a pulp, we'll face the abyss later. But the lessons are entirely apt.<br /><br />And if you think Randy ended up in the same place as he started -- which might appear to be true on the surface to be true -- I think you've missed his subtle transformation into someone who realizes that life and relationships can't be tied up into little bows, that the promise of love is mostly a dream that only sometimes ends well, that he doesn't have the energy or faith to face and try to overcome his psychological and emotional handicaps, and that life begins, and ends, alone. His courage in stepping into the ring that last time is a celebration of man as an individual -- rushing headlong into the irrationality of existence, seizing the moment, and being okay with it. And when it's your turn to die, and you lie there alone, and all spidery filaments of faith start to unwind in the face of a terminal sleep, will you have the courage to be alone and step forcefully into the unknown? That, I think, is what Randy did -- and it's inspiring.eizing the moment, and being okay with it. And when it's your turn to die, and you lie there alone, and all spidery filaments of faith start to unwind in the face of a terminal sleep, will you have the courage to be alone and step forcefully into the unknown?

B000935UGM|4.0|Bought this one on hearing Sweet Illusion, what a beautiful song. Loaded it on my mp3, played it on shuffle with other songs riding with my wife.   Everytime a song from the album came up she asked who  it was. it really is that good
B001L5SXQG|2.0|Holy cra...! The downward spiral continues... After the horribly produced \\"MAGIC\\", which at least had good songs badly produced, this new album has plenty od bad songs and bad lyrics! Amazing!<br /><br />What is happening? And the cover art of the last two albuns? Maybe ego is playing a great part, since both his last studio albuns have only a photo of Bruce, no scenery, nothing.<br /><br />Probably Brendan O'Brien keeps making The Boss believe that everything he writes is \\"magic\\", even the corniest of lyrics and the infinite repetition of those that abound in this album.<br /><br />One of the worst albuns ever in Bruce catalogue.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I consider myself to be in pretty decent shape because I workout with weights,(lunges, squats, upper body, etc) do mens pushups, and cardio at least 3 days a week. After this tape I realize I'm not as in shape as I thought! I decided to order this tape to mix up my workouts due to general boredom and I've fallen into a workout rut. Boy, I am glad I did! As some other reviewers mentioned, its best to start at level 1 unless you are very fit, trust me. I have sensitive knees and have done this workout 2 days in a row and they are good enough to keep using this tape. I am very careful to not put my knees over my feet and not twist them then doing the side lunges, as Jillian mentions. I should be up to level 2 in a couple weeks.     What I love is the fact this intense workout is only 20 minutes, which means there are really no excuses why I can't do it 5 days a week. I'm looking forward to a leaner healthier me in the near future!
B0018OAOQC|5.0|This album is absolutely awesome. Great mix of 50s sounds, metal, with a Danzig-like vocals. Definitely sounds like nothing I've ever heard before and it's my new favorite album. Must have this one!
B001F0TM5I|5.0|The woods are lovely dark and deep, and I have promises to keep and miles to go before I sleep.  Do you hear me butterfly? Miles to go before you sleep.    --Classic!!!   a must watch for any fan.
1881273156|5.0|Since having read this book, I have recommended it to numerous friends.  Apparently virtually all of us, who are fortunate enough to have significant others in our lives also have, from time to time, significant problems in relationships with these same significant others.  This book by Gary Chapman, more than any \\"self help\\" book I have ever read, has real tangible answers and take away messages to help improve, repair and rebuild most if not all realtionships-especially broken ones.  I am 62 years old.  Until reading this book I had no idea that individuals varied in terms on how they need to be loved.  Hard to believe at my age and realtionship experiences but trust me-most of you don't know what your partner really needs/wants from you either.  This is the best $15 I've ever spent...
B000SGGUWS|5.0|i really enjoyed this book. it always kept me interested and i couldnt put it down!
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Have watched six of the seven seasons so far. No problems, all discs play well. I loved the series when it was on TV. Wish it had kept going.<br />Besides the many talented actors/actresses, it really made you think. You have to wonder, do personality clashes like the ones seen on the series affect the real world events & goverments ? Probably.  I say buy this DVD series regardless of your political beliefs. Just enjoy it for what it is, a well made fiction series that comes in a nice storage container.
B001GCUER0|5.0|I have ordered and paid for this but have not yet received it?  When can I expect to receive it?  I understand it came out in  Jan??    Season 1 was wonderful.  Best show on TV.
0810994739|5.0|First let me tell you that my son for the most part hates reading. Getting him to read was comparable to getting him to brush his teeth (11 yr old boy, need I say more). This changed with some recent books I ordered, one being the entire series of Diary of a Wimpy Kid. He absolutely loves it. He read it diligently and could not wait for each new release.
B001EO748M|5.0|I always looked forward to Thursday nights and my hour with those  wonderful, crazy, sexy, back stabbing folk on the Tudors.  You have   to \\"stay tuned\\" to keep up with who is on whose side and who is   sleeping with who!  My history book never covered any of this.  If it  had, I might have paid attention.     I am counting the days until the series starts back!  Order Season  One and Two so you will know the beginning of this exciting story of  one English King gone bad.  Rate it Five Stars
B0015XHP3Q|5.0|I have seen this film before. But i want to watch this film in blu ray. And result very good quality and voices.
1568987846|4.0|I followed the 3191 blog from its inception and was very excited to finally get the book. I was a little suprised when it came in the mail because I was expecting a larger coffee-table style book. (If I had paid attention to the dimensions, I would have realized this wasn't the case.) The book is still beautiful, but I wish the pictures had been larger. Some of the diptychs are very small, and it's hard to see all of the detail. I still enjoyed leisurely looking through and remembering some of my favorite posts. I also enjoyed reading the authors' commentary. I might order some framed prints from [...] to enjoy the photos in a larger format.
B0017MO10U|3.0|The producers and writers hyped this show as going back to the older, early season feel of SG-1.  I think this movie would have been better as a series of episodes rather than a full-length movie.  The plot was OK but I thought the ending was very rushed and a bit of a cheat.  Granted, this is a matter of personal preference but I was also disappointed that Claudia Black did not get more screen time.
B0010YSD7M|4.0|I really like SG-1's first (if you do not count the ORIGINAL Stargate movie, which was not really SG-1) foray into feature length films.  The Ori story line was handled magnificently.  I was a little disappointed that the ending (of the movie, not the whole storyline) was not bigger, but it was very well done.
B00006AVRK|5.0|I bought this for my brother and sister-in-law's Christmas present.  They love it.  Hugh Laurie and Steven Fry have great chemistry and are amazing comedic actors.  Anyone who enjoys the older, family-friendly comedies of the 60s-70s will like \\"Jeeves & Wooster.\\"
B0000CNY27|5.0|Classic Sci-Fi at its best. What a great character! Seemed like Snake was always in a bad mood, which helps when you're dropped into a city (or prison) filled with scum. Harry Dean Stanton's character was funny, Donald Pleasance as the inept President, and Isaac Hayes as \\"The Duke\\" - \\"A\\" Number One. Best of all: Adrienne Barbeau..... Oh, her acting was pretty good, too.
B0010YPTGU|5.0|I ordered this by accident; I thought that I was ordering a Sarah Brightman DVD. I am very pleased with the DVD as Andrea is awesome and he performs with many different artist. I play it when I need some culture and just need something different. I believe that Sarah Brightman only sang two songs. If you love Sarah; you'll love this one.
0312383320|5.0|Janet Evanovich has completely out done herself with Plum Spooky.  It is exciting, spontaneous and wonderfully romantic.  This is a definite must read.
1416562605|5.0|The unusual first person voice drew me right in.  Balram is a self-made man, and while some of his deeds would unquestionably be characterized as immoral, in other respects he is one of the most compassionate and mindful characters in the book.  He likely is not an entirely reliable narrator, yet his story does raise provocative questions of what it means to live like a man and under what conditions such a human life becomes possible.
0385340990|5.0|I loved this book!  I found myself caught between trying to read a little bit at a time to stretch it out, making it last longer and reading sections in big gulps to find out what happens next.  It's been a very long time since I've enjoyed a book so thoroughly.  I've talked about it so much at work that there is a line of people wanting to borrow it.  I told them, do yourself a favor and buy your own copy because you won't want to lose track of it.  I hated for it to end.
B001KMB6X2|4.0|I was very disappointed in this DVD.  I liked the movie and had no problem with plot lines as others seem to have had.  This DVD is not the version shown in the theaters.  The HumV chase was cut out and put on the \\"special features\\" part of the disc.  This was a pivital point about the end of the Ramplings \\"church\\".  Also I remember at the end of the movie Vin Diesel was playing with the Mélanie Thierry's small girls at his rebuilt home in the woods, a more hopeful note to the ending than is on the DVD.  I wish that they had included both versions and let viewers decide for themselves.  Vin Diesel gave a better performance in this movie that he did in Man Apart and I thought he was very good in that.
B00005N6KG|5.0|The best headphones I've ever used. Now I'm spoiled and will never use anything else!!
B000UD0ESA|5.0|Not much more can be added to all the accolades offered by reviewers in the past. I most admire the painstaking handiwork of the Set Designer(s) and Decorator(s) of this monumental film. Hauntinlgy beautiful and yet sordid scenes from the future. Masterful direction by Ridley Scott<br /><br />Loved Harrison Ford and Edward James Olmos portrayals of the forced-out-of retirement \\"Blade Runner,\\" Deckard and the grudgingly former Blade Runner and overseer, Gaff. Rutger Hauer's masterful job as Roy Batty is unforgettable if not just for his final scene and touching dialogue before death. Sean Young as Rachel, is so beautiful and  alluring; as is Joanna Cassidy in her short role as \\"Zhora.\\" Brion James as \\"Leon\\" is as creepy as any of the characters he's played in other movies. And not forgetting Darryl Hanna as the gymnastic \\"Pris,\\" rounds out the \\"Replicants\\" that Deckard is assigned to destroy.<br /><br />One of the greatest Sci-Fi Adventures film ever.
B0007MWZEK|1.0|This vacuum is very lightweight but is not well made. The plastic is so thin that the plastic cover broke the first week (I was pretty careful.)    The battery charged for enough time to finish cleaning our kitchen and I was satisfied with what it picked up. However, if you swivel it (and that's what it is known for), it often flips over - especially on stairs. If it flips over or comes off the ground or even tilts at all, the dirt in the cup comes spewing out and you need a heavy duty vacuum to clean it up. Sounds like this wouldn't happen often but it does.  After using it every day for a few months, it just died.  I had a Bissel version of this and that one didn't last long either.  These things are cheap but I hate that we are putting them in landfills and that I'm paying for a new one every few months.      Is it that hard to make something that works longer than 3-4 months?
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Joss Whedon does it again! As much fun as the movie is, it's the DVD extras that make this a must-own. Not one but TWO commentary tracks, a collection of awesome video applications to the Evil League of Evil, and a good amount of puzzles and mysteries to solve in order to unlock the special Easter Eggs. (Including a blooper reel and a close-up look at the ELE themselves.)    [...]
0452289963|5.0|This is a book I'll read over and over.  It's very special, very enlightening.
B00000ING2|3.0|A next sweet story of a none made it hight on arrival in New York.<br /><br />Sometimes funny, sometimes tragic.<br /><br />Might be seen if none is to watch at all.
031606792X|5.0|A super last book to a super series.  From \\"Twighlight\\" to the 4th and last book was a wonderful experience.  I was sorry to have to finish the series.  I could have gone on with more.  My hats off to Ms. Meyer
0345440900|2.0|I was so excited when my neighbor lent me this book, I read it in one night. I could not have been more disappointed! It did not avidly encourage breastfeeding suggesting that we should put ourselves before our wee ones (breastfeeding will make your breasts pancakes)! Hello, if we wanted perfect boobs and a perfect body, perhaps we wouldn't have had babies to begin with. We all want what is best for our lil ones, and this is where I hated this book. The Hitler approach may work for a select few (you should see how your baby should be scheduled BY DAY 3!!!), but not in this house. I like the EASY approach (eat, activity, sleep, you) and treating your baby like an actual person, but I didn't need this book to tell me that!! All in all, a let down of a book!!!
0596522347|4.0|Don't be fooled, you won't finish the book with a degree in visual arts.  You won't really get a lot of the theory either, unless you already have a degree in visual arts. However, Nancy has given an overview of the best ways to use slides to visually communicate with passion.<br /><br />To present well you must build on the triad; a great idea communicated through well chosen words and memorable graphics. Nancy provides the much needed introduction to the graphical portion in a way that lets most of us improve our presentations. If you don't think you can spend a few hours over the next weeks discussing fonts, logo ideas, and color schemes with your team you might want to revisit your priorities. Don't we already waste hours on slides that are forgettable in minutes?<br /><br />Read the book, discuss it with your team. Generate ideas, implement the best ones. Change the world.
0061673730|2.0|This book is interesting, but over-hyped.  It attempts to answer two important questions:    1. What is Quality? (What is meant by the terms good and bad? Are these terms objective or subjective?)  2. How can we cope with the frustrations, monotonies, alienation and ugliness of technology and modern life?    Pirsig's answer to the first question amounts to a refusal to answer the question.  He argues that Quality is indefinable, that it is pre-intellectual awareness, that it is the source of all subjects and objects and therefore is neither subjective nor objective.    The problem with this argument is that Quality is not reality; it is a term we use to evaluate reality.  If Quality is everything, like the Tao or the Godhead, then everything has the same amount of quality because everything exists.  If I want to rank two essays, one as having poor quality and one as having high quality, under his definition of quality this is impossible - or at the best, gives us no means for ranking them.    Before I read this book, I had an instrumentalist view of quality.  Given a certain purpose or characteristic, those things that achieve that purpose most effectively or have the most of that characteristic have high quality.  Therefore there is no such thing as general Quality, only specific quality in reference to some given hierarchy of classification.  Pirsig not only fails to disprove this conception of Quality, but even if he did his conception of Quality provides no lens to view the world any differently.    His answer to the second question is good but not unique. His answer, as far as I can tell, is: Have the right attitude.  Be patient, calm, and concentrate on the moment or the job at hand.  Think about things logically, but also use your intuition.  Be reflective and meditative about your life and your surroundings.    All of those ideas are good - but none of them are insights.  There was nothing I hadn't already heard, or couldn't have gotten from a pop culture psychology book or a primer on relaxation techniques and Buddhism.
B00014NE62|5.0|The other reviewers have said about everything there is to be said about this movie.  I would just add, don't skip over this because you think it is just for gay people.  It's definitely a story everybody (with the possible exception of homophobes) will enjoy.<br /><br />This movie is just as much about Maurice's growing confidence, as it is about his love life.<br /><br />We women can't help but enjoy seeing three attractive men in gorgeous period clothing, knowing they are just pretending to be gay.  LOL
B000WTNDTY|5.0|I know this is an album that is fashionable to diss. I suspect that this is partly due to the questionable movie of the same name that came out at the time. There was nothing wrong with the concert sequences, but the critics slaughtered the 'fantasy' sequences at the time, and they weren't entirely wrong!<br />Musically however, there is little wrong with this. It's an excellent concert by a great band and contains superb versions of some of their songs: No Quarter, Since I've Been Loving You (not issued on the original LP), The Rain Song, The Song Remians the Same etc..<br />Whilst some can argue that Zep has played this or that song better at this or that gig, average Zep is still better than most rock bands' best and The Song Remains the Same is far from being average Zep.<br />The reissue has a bunch of tracks not issued onthe previous LP (but present in the movie) and the sound quality bears no relation to the original's. You feel you are there now.<br />An essential purchase if you are remotely interested in rock music.
B001GKJ2FC|5.0|I don't know what's with the haters.  This movie is awesome.  Watched it for the first time on blu-ray last night.

B0000542D2|5.0|Welcome to an historic moment in Sid the Elf lore. This is our 100th review. And what better way to celebrate the century mark than with The Beatles? Ever since Sid was just a baby elf, the Fab Four have been in heavy rotation in our musical selection. Also as a young elf, Sid loved this film so we decided to commemerate our 100th review with something special as well as awesome. In fact, A Hard Day's Night is so great that it isn't even B and it still got 5 stars from your pal, Sid the Elf.<br /><br />A Hard Day's Night was the boys' first film and it was successful in every way. It is a \\"mock-documentry\\" that dipicts a day in the life of John, Paul, George, and Ringo as they travel by train to a London TV studio for a gig. Of course, all kinds of shennanigans ensue on the trip and upon arrival, most involved Paul's grandfather who's a villain and a real mixer. All four Beatles showed their famous wit and charisma in the film along with surprisingly solid acting chops. This was especially true for Ringo, who got a little more of a showcase than the others. But, he still managed to be B once in the film. During one of the performance scenes, Richard Starkey is missing his skins by a good 6 inches on a close-up; hilarious every viewing.<br /><br />A Hard Day's Night is one of Sid's all-time favorites. It is an extremely entertaining and extremely funny movie. Throw in a soundtrack comprised of all Lennon-McCartney originals(well, except for the song George and Ringo are rocking out to on Ringo's little radio on the train), and we say this guy's got it. The film shows Beatlemania at its peak and the Boys in the eye of the hurricane. Obviously it's somewhat naive, but one of the things that makes the film so special is that it paints the Beatles exactly how these fans would like to picture them. So, needless to say, this one get a reco from Sid himself. Until next time, some advice from Sid and Grandfather McCartney: Watch your brisket.
B000ATQYT2|4.0|This product is wonderful.   A previous order that was supplied by BuyAccessories was poor.  They sold me a used Garmin when I paid for a new one.  It was purchased in Sept for a christmas gift.  When my daughter tried to register it after Christmas Garmin told her it was used and they fixed it for her.  My correspondence with BuyAccessories was not satisfactory.  I am not sure that I can continue to buy from amazon because of this experience with one of your sellers.
B000W91RUG|5.0|It surprised me how funny this show actually is.  I'm a self-professed nerd/geek, but I'm not good at math, or science, nor do I dress up as a Vulcan.  However, I can still really identify with the humor in this show.  The characters are well fleshed out, and the acting is terrific, especially by Jim Parsons.  Chuck Lorre has become my new favorite TV writer.  I love his vanity cards.
B000RJO578|5.0|Most people prefer Shaun of the Dead to Hot Fuzz, but in my opinion, this movie is just overall funnier in the end.  Maybe it's because I've seen more action movies than zombie movies.  But, regardless, this really is my favorite comedy, nothing else really comes quite close. When I saw it in theaters, it was me and one friend, and we pretty much didn't stop laughing the entire time. If you don't like British humor, you'll still probably find some parts of it you enjoy, but if you do, it's really just non stop fantastic. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost do and always will make an incredible comedic pair, and I really highly recommend this movie to most anyone.
0316067601|3.0|This story is a must read for an military buff. It is full of macho and attitude for even the most die hard redneck.The most difficult part of reading this book is the condescending arrogance by the storyteller. He refers to himself throughout the book as a giant warrior fom Texas whom is ready to conquer the World againt little nuisances ( people under 6 ft.)This is all well, but it becomes painfull to read when line after line, he refers to his superpowers. I have read alot of books written by Vietam prisoners of war, and the amazing accomplishments these heros have endured.Nothing can come close to the bigger than life attitude tha dominates this book.
B001GQSY5U|1.0|Short and simple:<br /><br />This movie is a lengthened version of a Saturday morning cartoon with a plot as thick as an atom and graphics that remind me of Gumby.  It's a good thing I didn't waste $.50 seeing this in the theater and instead borrowed it from my brother-in-law.  I would have wanted my $.50 back.<br /><br />Kids will probably enjoy the film and possibly those who are really young kids at heart.  I personally look to a film for plot, character development, theme, and cinematics.  Aside from the fight on the sheer cliff of where monestary is situated (cinematics), the movie failed in every category for me.<br /><br />Maybe it won't for you.  But don't say I didn't warn you.
B001KWPU3E|5.0|I love this album! I wasn't crazy about Dido's second album, but I loved the first one. This is a lot more like the first one.
B001M6KTLG|1.0|I have to echo the same sentiments as others here. I have been a lifelong fan of both Indiana Jones and Harrison Ford, but this movie made my insides hurt.    I think Harrison did GREAT as Indy - his age didn't bother me one bit.  Shia did a good job as well. Everything else, though, was awful. Aside from the acting, plot and CGI garbage that was all too prominent, the number one issue for me was that Indy never saves the day.     In every other movie Indy met and overcame insurmountable odds. It is what makes Indiana Jones... well.. Indiana Jones! Whether fist fighting a camp of Nazis, a mine full of Thuggee cultists or fighting a tank on horseback, Indy always managed to beat the odds with wit or grit or being just plain too stubborn to quit.     In Crystal Skull this just never happens. In fact, Indy is saved by others more than he rescues them! Indy is supposed to be an adventure *hero* - what happened to that???    Shame on Lucas and Spielberg both for tarnishing the Indy name!
B000V86OKG|4.0|If you like Dexter (and who couldn't LOVE this sweet serial killer) then this collection is a MUST!  If there is any problem at all, it is the compulsive need to watch all the episodes in one sitting!  We loved it!

1400082773|1.0|This was recommended reading for a class I am currently enrolled in for Race, Gender, Class, and Sexuality. I found the book incredibly difficult to get through due to the writing style. It is written on a low and easily comprehensible level which I feel truly diminished the content. If the goal was to write an easy read it may have been accomplished; but to what advantage I am unsure. I found the grammatical composition (ex. run-on sentences)hard to follow. The read did not engage me on any meaningful level. I did happen to vote for the man.
B001F290E4|5.0|Seal's rendition of Sam Cook's \\"A Change is Gonna Come\\" is right up there with Sam's! Emotionally soaring. The other 11 songs are equally wonderful, from \\"I Can't Stand the Rain\\" and \\"I've Been Loving You Too Long\\" to \\"It's a Man's Man's Man's World,\\" this is a must-have CD for Seal's fans, and anyone who would like to sample his music.
B0010ZR160|3.0|...overall this one missed the mark.    What I really liked about it was the richness of the neighborhood in which it was filmed. The characters, the locations, the dialog/dialects. All very, very realistic.    What I couldn't get on board with was the story, which started out fine enough, but then devolved into this pseudo-noir with bad plot development and a silly, righteous ending that ticked me off. Case Affleck was a tough swallow for a tough guy. And I feel he was held back in his his acting by his director brother - who, i feel, held on too tight to this one.    Overall, it felt forced and I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it.
B0018CVQFM|5.0|As I write this, Graham Nash has just had a big weekend.   He spent it on 'sacred ground' in Clear Lake, Iowa, celebrating the music and life of Buddy Holly.   Today, February 3rd, he gives us a wonderful present on the day after his sixty-seventh birthday -- this new box set, REFLECTIONS.   Have you opened it yet?       We receive a retrospective here, of course - three CD's with a total of sixty-four songs, some well-known, many catchy, others very moving - every single one heartfelt.   The case even has the texture of a well-worn photograph album.   He invites us in the first pages of the booklet tucked in there to sit back and enjoy -- after all, as articulate, gifted and committed as he might be, Nash, as he says to this day about Holly, is really one of us.   He has shared little anecdotes about every song, and on every facing page he has chosen a picture to go with it.    Oh, we'll respond, too, all right, about  how sweet a confession 'Right Between the Eyes' is in that mix, and how angry Nash really was when he stormed home and wrote 'Immigration Man'...  and so on.   But friends, even ones we don't know in person, rouse our sympathies just that way.   Long time fans of his music already know that all too well.  The new mixes are like a deeper dive into familiar reefs or a further trip into a beloved retreat.  The new SONGS are not to be missed.  If there were such a thing as a CD single yet, 'Try and Find Me', 'Lonely Man' and 'In Your Name' would be an unbeatable combination on its own.    Graham, apparently the last to toot his own horn, has said in recent interviews that making up REFLECTIONS was painful for him.   But may he be well rewarded for this.  You see, every heart he touches warms up and every note he sings turns to golden sunlight.  I myself second his recommendation and congratulate him with all my heart in return.
032147404X|3.0|Due to the large number of five star reviews, I think I was expecting more from this book.  Thankfully I don't think I paid much more than $[...] for it, so the fact that I only found about 20% of it helpful, doesn't bother my wallet too much.  I felt like a vast majority of the book was a high prices camera shopping list, telling you what kind of equipment you would need that goes into the thousands of dollars (in addition to your camera).  Scott does a good job of not playing brand favorites in his equipment recommendations, that said, he recommends all this specific equipment for each type of picture, and between all the lenses, and filters, tripods and equipment Scott recommends, you would need a large SUV to carrying around all that crap, plus a HUGE savings account to blow.  It stressed me out to read a book telling me I NEEDED to spend thousands of dollars in additional equipment to get the results he was suggesting.  I would find a book that teaches you how to get good results with a normal DSLR and a kit lens far more helpful than this book which tends to lean toward a shopping list.
B001FSDOZO|5.0|After some confusion with Pepsi sweepstakes and loosing all my points because of a error on Pepsi' part, Amazon gave me the difference anyway as good gesture which was excellent.

0198326769|5.0|The setting of my book is in Auschwitz. The main events are when Bruno moves, he meets shmuel, then he sneaks into the camp, and Bruno not understanding what the camp was. I like how the kid is all confused, and they think they're in a farm not a concentration camp. The conflict is that Bruno's parents don't let him talk to shmuel. I recommend this book to other middle school students.
B001DMJ9R4|5.0|THIS LIVE ALBUM IS JUST AMAZING. GREAT SOUND, GREAT SOUND OF THE BAND AND THE VOICE OF M. SHADOWS SOUNDS LOUD. IF YOU'RE A FANATIC OR JUST LIKE TO HEAR A GOOD LIVE ALBUM, BUY IT!!!
032147404X|5.0|This book delivers what the author promises. No Technical jargon or useless theory. Just follow the recipes for the type of pictures you want and click. This book can be independent of the first volume, but the advice in both books are worth their weight in GOLD
B000SFJWLU|2.0|It's safe to call Five Finger Death Punch (or 5FDP according to their fans) a supergroup. Darrell Roberts and Jeremy Spencer of W.A.S.P., Matt Snell of Anubis Rising, Ivan Moody of Motograter, and founder Zoltan Bathory of U.P.O. are no newcomers to music. But what exactly does their debut album, \\"The Way of the Fist\\", have to offer? Nothing really.<br /><br />First off, my main gripe is the lyrical performance. It's utterly pathetic and juvenile. I'd post lyrical examples but that would basically hog up space for the review. The musicianship isn't terrible but it's been done before, and the nu-metal influence doesn't help things out either. The double bass isn't bad and the guitar work is decent, which save this from being complete garbage.<br /><br />This seriously could have been much more. Technically proficient musicianship is wasted on songs that are shallow and forgettable. I could only recommend this if you don't mind metalcore, nu-metal, or groove metal. Otherwise, you're not missing out on anything.

B0002Z0EYK|2.0|... read Homer (the original story was much better than the one he cooked up), and why couldn't he get a real music composer, since the James Horner should have been credited only as \\"sound effects\\" (and a very poor one at that). I'm sure to keep away from any movie he will pollute.....
0340838035|5.0|Dark theme but very captivating.  Was the first book I have read by this author and plan to read more.
B001230JXC|5.0|If you needed any convincing of \\"Violater\\" as a classic, this takes the best of what defined 80s techno (catchy, personal lyrics, a suave sexiness) and brought it for the 90s with a slightly rawer edge, a little more verve and a more coy attitude. The subject matter is not unlike another 1990 classic, Enigma's MCMXC. Both are sly mixes of sexuality and spirituality that you can perform rhythmic activities to, but Depeche plays, flirts and seduces where Enigma waxes philosophical.<br /><br />Depeche Mode are masters whose only stumbling block was the disappointing \\"Ultra\\", which lacked wholesale the charisma of \\"Violater\\".<br /><br />So why write this review 18 years late?<br />About three weeks ago a little strain of chorus entered my head:<br />\\"All I ever wanted, all I ever needed ...\\"<br /><br />AND IT JUST WOULDN'T LEAVE!<br /><br />Fortunately I found my cure (er depeche) on the MP3 store.<br /><br />The remastering is fantastic. Crisp, loud, clear. And the music will never fade as if the CD scratched.
0316789798|5.0|My daughter brought home two of Ed Emberley's drawing books from the school library.    She immediately began to draw little cartoons and towns and people using the books as guides to her work.    When she showed me her work I was amazed and quite tickled to see how well she had done.    She was totally into these books for the time period that she had them. When I looked on Amazon to see if they were something stocked (the books from the libary were quite old and well worn) I was pleasantly suprised to see that they are still sold and in paperback form no less.    For the price that Amazon had them at, the 4 for 3 promotion that was applied, and the sheer joy of my 10 year old daughter, I had to order four of them.    As far as drawing books go, she has never been so pleased.    They are well worth the investment as your child will be provided with hours of entertainment if drawing is one of their favorite activities.    Highly recommended!

B00005M91K|5.0|Of course, the title of this review is supposed to be amusing...  This movie encapsules the Earth.  It portrays an intricate narrative of images that will move you to tears, make you smile with joy, and realize that the way you live is very relative to your own culture and species.    Words do not do this movie justice. Watch it with an open mind and you will fall in love.

B000Y9PILI|5.0|This Graham Nash CD/DVD is a treat.  The \\"liner notes\\" are actually a nicely-written booklet that puts the genesis of the album in a bit of \\"historical\\" perspective, and we are reminded that the beautiful simplicity and sadness of some of these songs owe much to Nash's break-up with Joni Mitchell.  Best of all... the sound is terrific!  My only other version of the album is the original LP, and there were so many pops and cracks on it that they had become a part of the compositions!  This CD restores everything pristinely, and the re-mix brings out aspects of the music you never heard before.  Also some DVD extras of Nash conversing about his photography.  Nice.
B00005O438|3.0|Cujo is one scary film! It doesn't help that I have a fear of crazy dogs, this movie leaves nothing to the imagination. Cujo is a St. Bernard who has been bitten by a bat and now has rabies, that explains his grotesque behavior. A mother and son are trapped in their tiny car and that insane Cujo wants to rip them to shreds. This film is based on Stephan King's novel, good film but kinda silly. It's a mixed bag for me.

B00006F7S4|5.0|I certainly don't have time to review all cd's but I felt this becoming one of my favorites deserved a plug.  From the first notes of \\"The Golden Age\\" this album sets me at ease. It always takes me to a calm place where my anxieties melt.  I know Beck changes with every CD and reinvents himself but I can't say I liked all Incarnations. In fact I can leave Odelay!  But I urge all of you who know something good when you hear It to get this CD. Just awesome \\"Lost Cause\\" another highlight.  I love songs like \\"Think I'm In Love\\" from another Beck CD \\"The Information\\" but as an flowing CD this Is his masterpiece In my opinion.  PS I have the DVD surround of It. I highly suggest It If you have surround sound. Engulfs You
B0015HOFZI|5.0|Husband just loves it.  I had a pile of old vinyl in our basement including some of my high school band recordings.  My old turntable was useless and he was getting irritated at stuff sitting around not being used.  The turntable really does the trick of digitalizing my old recordings and taking out all of the noise.  We can then transfer it to CD's. Only problem here is that old CD players that do not recognize the new format.  But the new CD players do.  My only disappointment was that 2 days after we bought it, there was a $25 price reduction and Amazon would not adjust our price.  He is having alot of fun and I finally get to listen to stuff that I have not heard in years.
B00177Y9ZC|4.0|This movie Is a must for any sci-fi fans. And action fans. With breathtaking scenic changes at a moments notice. When I think of the possibilities this movie could have been I can't help but wonder what held either the writer/director back.  Just the same a wonderful escape and adventure for all.  I can't help but think It's one of Hayden Christensen's best since Star Wars.  Likely to be sequels, but of course not as good.  On my list as one of the better movies of 08' though. A year In which not many really good movies were released.
B001GSV3EC|5.0|Jeff Beck is a rock legend (who also mixes in liberal amounts of jazz), but more than that: he is in his own category as an electric guitar player. He does not rely much on special effects (her refers to himself as a \\"minimalist\\" in that regard), but rather on phrasing, touch, and tone. He often finger picks and has a tremendous dynamic and emotional range for an electric guitar player. While fast, Jeff is no \\"shredder,\\" but is rather the master of taste, passion, and (oddly enough) restraint--something unknown to (say) Joe Satriani or John Petrucci.<br /><br />The mix is a bit muddy, though, and the drums sounds somewhat tinny (which may be the set more than the recording). There is some keyboard work, mostly synthesized. The supporting band is adequate (there are no vocals), but Jeff is the star. To my mind, he has never sounded better.
0783230079|5.0|I love this movie.  It is a wonderful romantic comedy with music I absolutely love.  It's a feel good movie that you can watch many times.  The acting is great.  Buy it and enjoy the fantasy.  :)
B000784WMW|5.0|This is the first Jane Eyre movie that I ever saw, several years ago, and after watching this one, I became a true Jane Eyre fan!<br /><br /> I just loved this Mr. Edward R., He is your classic, rugged ,tall, dark and handsome leading man, with compelling, pretty eyes! I loved the heartfelt, profound tender way, that Edward was with Jane, he was so tall, and Jane was so short, and petite and yet Edward and Jane looked like they belonged together! I just loved this movie, and I highly recommend it!<br /><br /> I loved the way Jane with her quiet ways, and soulful eyes, touched Edward's broken heart. Jane tried to hide her feelings for Edward, and poor Edward, could not hold back his feelings for Jane, he loved her so!<br /><br /> I also so loved, the pretty decorated, beautiful rooms of Thornfield. This is a touching, heartfelt, and wonderful love story! After going thru their hidden sorrows, and profound sadness, and lost of hope, Jane and Edward finally found, well deserved happiness together! This is a all-time, classic love story, that has pain, and heartbreak, and love, and joy!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love this DVD.  There are 3 - 20 minute segments.  They get harder as they go along.  You think 20 minutes is going to be an easy workout but oh no, not with Jillian.  Once you're done with your 20 minutes, you'll know you've worked out.  It's tough but it feels so good when you've accomplished the workout.  Today will be my 7th day to do it.  I can already feel tightness in my muscles from what I've done so far.  I would recommend this DVD.  I plan to purchase more of her stuff in the near future.
0316067601|5.0|I bought this book at half price on a bargain table. I had no idea what i was getting. I had not heard of it, and honestly my wife picked it up and thought i might like it. I agreed and we took it home. It sat on my bedside table for a couple of weeks until i finished up three other books i was in the middle of reading. I can say honestly it is the BEST book i have ever read. I think every American should have to read this book as part of just being American. I had watched some documentaries on SEAL training before and had some appreciation of the skills, but never did i realize what the extent of the training was for. The Author does an amazing job of humanizing the characters early in the book which is honestly a slower part, but when it picks up you cannot put this book down! I read the last 250 pages nonstop. This is the first book to bring me to tears, and as already stated everyone should read it!!
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|My issue with music lately is as follows. Two or three singles per album and ten or so filler songs. So, I stopped buying music by the album. I bought this album. All of it. No filler here kids, this is a hard hitting rock album that hails back to greats like Queen and does not falter. Way to go guys!
B000654OUG|5.0|I have a large collection of Schubert solo piano recordings, from Brendel to Kempff.  It is no small claim to say that one comprehensive set of 8 CDs by a single pianist is the finest.  Uchida has accomplished exactly that.  This set is as beautifully played as her famed Mozart sonatas cycle.  As an added bonus, the recorded sound is in the audiophile class, worthy of the very finest 2-channel system.  In fact, how can you not play these CDs on the best available audio equipment, and as often as possible?  These are desert island discs to be treasured forever.  To appreciate the full glory of this rare musical experience, I would not recommend the compressed MP3 downloads.  For the price that Amazon is advertising (about $7 per CD), any music lover is doing themselves a major disservice not to grab a set today.
B000002JOH|1.0|I like Pantera. I liked their Cowboys from Hell album. However, they sold out with this album. The tried to go commercial to reach a greater audience. I uderstand why but I think it wasn't a good idea. Listen to \\"Walk\\" That song is so basic that anyone in the world could do it. If you want Pantera BEFORE they sold out, either get Cowboys from Hell our their albums before that (yes they have PRE Cowboys from Hell albums, even though Pantera tries to deny it)
0736063684|5.0|I am a Pilates and Personal Fitness Trainer. Many of my students want to understand the exercises they do and would like to know what areas of the body they are working.

The book has wonderful visuals.  Barbara Wintroub, Retrofit Pilates

B0014XCMVM|5.0|Flavors of Entanglement is what an album should be but so few artists achieve: a musical event with a captivating story.  Although Jagged Little Pill is stuffed with hits, the composition is juvenile in comparison to Flavors.  Alanis has grown up, and her music has matured likewise.      \\"Citizen of the Planet\\" grooves with Indian beats and takes the listener on a journey of self-exploration.  My favorite line: \\"And I come alive, and I get giddy, and I am taken and globally naturalized.\\"     \\"Underneath\\" is an intriguing double-story with a thumping heartbeat and classic Alanis vocals.  This song sends a most important message that all of us need to hear: instead of going around telling everyone else how to better themselves and the world, you can do the most good by looking inward.  Chorus: \\"There is no difference in what we're doing in here that doesn't show up as bigger symptoms out there. So why spend all our time dressing up bandages when we've the ultimate key to the cause right here - our underneath.\\"     \\"Straightjacket\\" is angry, yes, but in an oh-so-fun way that you can dance to! \\"I don't know who you're talking to with such [...] disrespect!\\"    \\"Versions of Violence\\" is an absolutely captivating evaluation of Alanis' anger and pain in the form of regret and growth.  Chorus: \\"These versions of violence, sometimes subtle, sometimes clear, and the ones that go unnoticed still leave their mark once disappeared.\\"    \\"Not As We\\" is a poignant, emotional waterfall of a ballad.  The first time you intently listen to this song, you WILL want to cry.  You can feel Alanis' pain and uncertainty at being alone, but this is doused with her conviction to bravely move on.  Chorus: \\"Day one, day one, start over again. Step one, step one, I'm barely making sense. Just yet I'm faking it `til I'm pseudo-making it. From scratch begin again, but this time I as I and not as we.\\"               I'm running out of time, so I'll skip to the best and last song on the album.    \\"Incomplete\\" is a lyrical masterpiece with folk undertones and vocals that will knock you down.  Since the whole song is so awesome, here are the complete lyrics:    One day I'll find relief, I'll be arriv-ed  And I'll be a friend to my friends who know how to be friends  One day I'll be at peace, I'll be enlightened  And I'll be married with children and maybe adopt  One day I will be healed  I will gather my wounds forge the end of tragic comedy    I have been running, so sweaty my whole life, urgent for a finish line  I have been missing the rapture this whole time, of being forever incomplete    One day my mind will retreat, and I'll know god  And I'll be constantly one with her night, dusk, and day  One day I'll be secure  Like the women I see on their 30th anniversaries    I have been running, so sweaty my whole life, urgent for a finish line  I have been missing the rapture this whole time, of being forever incomplete    Ever unfolding, ever expanding, ever adventurous, and torturous  ...but never done    One day I will speak freely  I'll be less afraid and measured outside of my poems and lyrics and art  One day I will be faith-filled  I'll be trusting and spacious, authentic, and grounded and home    I have been running, so sweaty my whole life, urgent for a finish line  I have been missing the rapture this whole time, of being forever incomplete

0143036556|4.0|In Collapse, Diamond lays out an excellent framework for discussing what makes societies fail. He surveys multiple sites of collapse (quite global in scale) and determines a short list of factors that predict \\"collapse.\\" While his historical/geographic work is rigorous and leaves little room for rebuttal on substantive counts (specifically addressing allegations that his previous work \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" was environmentally deterministic), his approach to the material gets really repetitive: he sets up his framework in the beginning and then takes us through his five axes of collapse over and over again in the case of each society.<br /><br />This is still a great text, though, and it will help a newcomer get a working understanding of the problems that have plagued small or ancient societies (the Maya, Easter Island) to the issues we are still working through (China's pollution, Australia's demand on their natural resources).
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Product arrived on time and as advertised.  I would buy from this seller again in the future.
0060594896|1.0|I listened to the CD version of this book.  It appears to have been written very quickly.  It re-hashes the same old things you have heard before.  I do not believe any new research was done for this book.  Worse, many of his examples are from his own success selling other books.  It seems to me he  is just pumping out books to line his pockets and whatever creative desire to help he had has been used up in his first few books.  There are many authors like this and Canfield seems to be preying on people who are looking for help at a particular time.

B001LF4IA6|3.0|THE BAND: Bruce Springsteen (vocals, guitars, harmonica, keyboards, percussion, glockenspiel), Nils Lofgren (guitars), Steve Van Zandt (guitars), Roy Bittan (piano, organ, accordion), Danny Federici (organ), Garry Tallent (bass), Clarence Clemons (saxophones), Patti Scialfa (vocals), Max Weinberg (drums & percussion), and additional musicians - Soozie Tyrell (violin), Patrick Warren (organ, piano, keyboards), Jason Federici (accordion on \\"The Last Carnival\\").<br /><br />THE DISC: (2009) 13 songs clocking in at approximately 52 minutes. Included with the disc is a 22-page booklet containing song titles/lyrics, band member photos, thank you's, and a personal note regarding Danny Federici (R.I.P. - one of the original E-Street band members). This is Springsteen's 16th studio album. There is a deluxe edition - available with a 38-minute behind the scenes making of the album DVD. The Japanese (only) cd edition contains a bonus track, \\"A Night With The Jersey Devil\\". Track 13, \\"The Wrestler\\" is considered a bonus track - added to the disc after the success of the movie of the same name. Like the album's predecessor (\\"Magic\\"), the disc case is made of slick thin eco-friendly cardboard. Recorded at Southern Tracks, Atlanta, GA. Label - Columbia Records.<br /><br />COMMENTS: I've been listening to Springsteen since the late 1970's and I'll be the first to admit - I like The Boss when he rocks. For me, the past decade was hit and miss for Bruce - \\"The Ghost Of Tom Joad\\" (1995) was downright average; \\"The Rising\\" (2002) was upbeat and brought Bruce back into the limelight; \\"Devils & Dust\\" (2005) and \\"We Shall Overcome - The Seeger Sessions\\" (2006) were folksy misses. I do admire Springsteen for taking chances. That doesn't mean though that I have to love and praise everything he does. In 2007, \\"Magic\\" gave me a renewed interest in The Boss. \\"Magic\\" was for the most part a bitter album filled with poetic angst revolving around economic hardships and pain... at times, totally disillusioned with the state of America. The lyrics bit hard. The melodies were memorable and catchy. Seems so much of Bruce's affective and poignant music and lyrics often comes from his lowest of low points. Even on the cover of \\"Magic\\" - The Boss looks hard-edged, gruff and maybe even slightly pissed off.<br /><br />With \\"Working On A Dream\\" the E-Street Band is back and still fully in tact. While much of the overall feel of the album might be a continuation of \\"Magic\\", the words and messages the listener gets are mostly polar opposite - pertaining to that of hope and happiness. The stories just aren't as engrossing as the previous album(s). The melodies just aren't as significant - similar tempos come off recycled and end up running into each other. Notes on songs: \\"Outlaw Pete\\" - a strong story with emphasis on string arrangements (my easy favorite here); \\"My Lucky Day\\" - an upbeat tune and Clemons' sax shines (too bad his sax is non-existent on the rest of the album); the bluesy throwback \\"Good Eye\\"; the title track is good, but the 15 seconds of whistling in the middle almost ruin it for me; \\"This Life\\" and \\"Kingdom Of Days\\" are modified all-is-right-with-the-world hymns better suited for the church; \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" is a wonderful Jakob Dylan impersonation; \\"The Last Carnival\\" is a wonderfully soft song about life on the road - dedicated to long time bandmate Federici; and the bonus track \\"The Wrestler\\" is a solid acoustic slow piece that makes me think about the movie, which in turn makes me think of Mickey Rourke's sad state facially... it's a song penned by Bruce at actor Rourke's request - about a loser (with undying spirit no less). Some tracks are downright flat and repetitious - with \\"Surprise Surprise\\" Bruce repeats the title 42 times (one of his worst songs in years); the title track repeats the chorus 22 times; singing about the beauty bagging his groceries in \\"Queen Of The Supermarket\\" - just the most woefully silly lyrics of any Bruce song inrecent memory. Even the \\"Working On A Dream\\" album cover is happy and colorful... a softer, gentler Bruce is surely represented.<br /><br />Rolling Stone magazine (Feb 2009) praised this album to no end - and again it makes me wonder - am I missing the boat, or is the magazine staff writer a Boss magnet from Freehold, NJ? In the end though, decades have passed, and I still find myself longing for the truly mythical song lyrics that came from his albums in the 70's and 80's. And it makes me wonder if the days of the New Jersey king belting out his amazing working class tales have passed us by. It's likely so - and the safe world of adult contempory music is better off for it. 10 of the 13 songs on \\"Dream\\" fit into the corporate cookie-cutter 3 to 4 minute mold. Two songs are in the 2-minute range, while the leadoff track, \\"Outlaw Pete\\", hits a staggering 8 minutes (rare in this day and age for Bruce).<br /><br />Springsteen has always been up on his politics and culture - and was he making a statement (Nov 2008) performing the title track at an Obama rally in Cleveland ? Is a message about working hard to achieve your dreams right around the corner (here it is - buy this album). I thought this kind of stuff was reserved for U2's Bono. \\"Working On A Dream\\" is no 5-star Boss outting (like \\"Born To Run\\", \\"Darkness On The Edge Of Town\\", and \\"Born In The USA\\" among others). Long time fans will probably get together like bobbleheads sitting on a car dash riding down a bumpy road agreeing this is one of his best albums... I for one, simply can't do that. The science of government aside, ultimately, I feel this album simply has too much love, merriment and sap. The melodies are average fare by Bruce's standards. The lyrics ultimately disappointing (again, by Bruce's standards). And, like its predecessor \\"Magic\\", the guitar solos are for the most part absent, and the sound on a majority of the songs suffer from over-production. Maybe these songs will come to life on stage (and fans know Springsteen sets the standard for a live performance). In Springsteen's catalog of albums, \\"Working On A Dream\\" is overall a decent album, but far from classic status (3+ stars).e \\"Working On A Dream\\" album cover is happy and colorful... a softer, gentler Bruce is surely represented.

1582701709|1.0|The bad news: this book in my opinion, it pure nonsense!<br />The good news: I only paid $1.00 for it at a book sale.<br /><br />I will say that both the book and the dvd were very well marketed, and even promoted by OPRAH. To me, it appears that Byrne did not even write the book, but merely edited it. She quotes from over 20 different modern day teachers who have supposedly achieved wealth and happiness.<br /><br />What is The Secret? Rhonda Byrne says that it is The Law of Attraction ---whatever is going on in your mind--- if the thoughts are positive, those thoughts will be like a magnet that will pull everything good to you.<br /><br />The process:<br /><br />  * Ask, Believe, Receive<br />  * Want more money, find the perfect mate, have a new house, new car, or huge raise: ask for it, believe you're going to get, and you'll get it --yeah right!<br />  * You can create your own perfect health and eternal youth --what about genetics?<br /><br />Conversely, all bad things happen because you dwell on the thought too much.<br />According to Byrne - we get in life what we think about, because our mind sends messages to the Universe.<br /><br />So is that how some children fall victim to abuse? They thought about it too much, or is that why some people get cancer? They thought about it too much? How crazy is that? If all we had to do was ASK for a cure for cancer BELIEVE it would happen and then RECEIVE it, doesn't it seem like many many people would have been miraculously cured, and we would hear about it.<br /><br />Sadly, there are no magic answers to why some things happen in life. \\"Wishing doesn't make it so\\", and if you wished for something and it did not happen, then the author tells us it's because we really did not BELIEVE it would happen!<br /><br />Very disappointing. Save your money, and borrow this book from the library if you still want to read it.

1416562591|5.0|There are a maze of thoughts and reactions to this book for me. The complex culture of India in transition is the story here. There is an economic and cultural revolution occurring in India as we speak and the caste system of the rooster coop is breaking up.  Certainly this is a bleak and dark novel but it contained humor, hope and heart as well for the future.  What is amazing is that every caste has their power structures from the lowest to the highest. This is a story of breaking through the caste system but the cost is very high and only a white tiger is able to achieve it.  This book contains a powerful indictment of the political and legal corruption within India and how this corruption is manipulated by some and others fall victim to it.   This is a powerful read that I throughly enjoyed.

B001LRJH0U|3.0|Although as a Western, Appaloosa has its fair share of the usual barren landscapes, quick-on-the-draw shootings and loners traveling about the countryside exacting their own brand of harsh justice, this directorial offering by Ed Harris is really a slyly funny sex comedy with all the trappings of saucy French burlesque.<br /><br /> . . . French, that is as in Mrs. Allie French, the Rene&eacute; Zellweger character who wreaks havoc on the minds of two meandering lawmen--friends Virgil Cole, played by Ed Harris with a somber albeit tongue-in-cheek roguishness and the loyal Everett Hitch, dramatized by Viggo Mortensen with a quiet perfection that endows his character with as much patience for his partner than one could ever wish for in a long-term spouse.<br /><br />Hired by the Appaloosa locals to contend with the alarmingly bullying Jeremy Irons, Cole and Hitch speedily incorporate their tried and true penal code that wins the West for them until Allie comes along as the attractively guileless fly in the ointment.<br /><br />Comedic moments abound as the hardened and murderous Cole befuddled by French's attentions turns humorously domesticated--escorting his lady love on a buggy ride that drops the jaws of his colleagues and choosing curtain material for a house he builds for her at the end of the Main Street in town.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this paragon of womanly virtue is about as unseemly as the rest of the stereotypical ladies typically seen populating the saloon in most Westerns.  Harris's Allie can't figure out which man she wants.  When she tries her hand at the unassuming Everett, she creates an interesting triangle of companions that although seems to reach a comfortable level of comradeship, sizzles with the same undercurrent of wry amusement shared by the two gunslingers and their increasingly enlightened audience.<br /><br />Harris and Mortensen dance through their roles with the perfect timing of two pros that enjoy what they are doing and obviously liked what their chemistry together did for the film.  Although possessed by intermittent volatility, Harris plays Cole in an almost offhanded way--he wields a mean gun with the accuracy of a heat-seeking missile yet flounders when he fails to call to mind the correct word to finish his often hesitant sentences.  Mortensen, on the other hand, provides the perfect foil.  With his good looks hidden for the most part by a huge hat and hideous facial hair, he says little, but witnesses much as registered by the twist of his lips and the twinkle in his eyes. He's a leather-booted guardian angel that the other members of the cast perhaps can outshoot but can never fool.<br /><br />Bottom line?  Appaloosa as directed by Ed Harris cattle prods the usual Western into a slick little sex comedy that Ed Harris, Viggo Mortensen and Rene&eacute; Zellweger clearly enjoyed making.  The story at times is a little slow, but the chemistry between the actors, especially Mortensen and Harris, make the viewing well worth the price of admission.  While the typical Western always features a 19th or early 20th century knight errant wandering the countryside in search of either freedom from civilization or some quest (noble or otherwise), Appaloosa informs its audience that the motivation for its women wasn't all that much different.

B001P9EQH8|4.0|For years I enjoyed listening to CDs at the gym with a pair of 32Ohm Sennheiser EH-150's and a 15mW Sony DNE-330 Walkman (with customizable paremetric EQ).  But, alas, the Walkman died and the current lineup of portable CD players all boasted only 5mW of output power (albeit the same EQ and bass boost features) ... and what a sonic difference those missing 10 milliWatts made!  I nearly cried each time I put on the headphones, knowing how good they could sound if only ... .  And headphone amplifiers were either AC-powered or outlandishly high-priced -- or both!<br /><br />Until the Fiio E5!  Finally, a 150mW, portable, high-fidelity headphone amplifier that -- connected to the right components -- returns your music to it's full dynamic range and frequency spectrum.  My Sennheisers roar!  Thumping bass!  Sizzling treble!  Quiet soft passages and deafening loud passages ... all from a rechargable gizmo about the size of a matchbook!<br /><br />But it is what it is.  The Fiio E5 does not have nearly the amp to drive my full-size 150Ohm Sennheiser HD-525s to their abilities; alternately, hooked up to my son's Ipod Touch (which apparently has quite a bit of output power to begin with) and his preferred earbuds I could not notice a distingushable improvement in sound.  But for an underpowered portable CD or MP3 player and a mid-sized set of high-fidelity headphones ... the Fiio E5 is a godsend.  Hear what you've been missing!  And for under $25?  It's a no-brainer.

B001O2MBMI|3.0|I really like Leona Lewis and \\"Spirit\\" is a great album. However, the deluxe edition do not do justice to be called deluxe edition. Even though \\"Run\\", which was a cover of Snow Patrol's, was great. The two other new songs included in this album do not go along with this album at all, they stuck out horribly. The remix of \\"Bleeding Love\\" was horrible as well. I believe they just rushed this album while Leona is still fresh. If you have already own the original version of Spirit, don't waste your money.
B000000WI4|4.0|I bought this cd as a present to my son, so we both got to listen.  The shipping, price, packing, all that were great.    The album is a tribute to Hooker of sorts, with him playing and singing with other recognized masters. ( I was surprised to see Johnny Winter was still alive.)  In an earlier effort with Canned Heat, Hooker is so obviously beyond Heat, it is almost painful.  That doesn't happen here. Everybody is competent, and at it's best it is masters jamming together.

031606792X|2.0|I dont want to go on whole rant with spoilers, but I will say that I was disappointed. The character development and personalities of Bella, Edward, and Jacob that made me fall in love with them in the first three books gets washed away because of weird rediculous events that happen that you would never see coming...or you would expect too much to happen, after reading Eclipse. SM just made it too easy for everyone to get there cliche happy ending. Its worth the read to see what happens and I still read the book in just one day, but I dont know if I even want to bother with ever re-reading the first three or Midnight Sun when it comes out knowing what happens later.
B001GKJ2DO|4.0|I bought this movie for my two daughters 16 & 21. The story line is a little silly, but the setting is romantic and beautiful. We all enjoyed watching it together. I had so much fun singing along - my kids looking at me the whole time: \\"You know this music?!\\" (Like we didn't have radios in the 'olden days'.) The actors make it look like they were having a blast as they filmed it. None of them have spectacular, broadway, singing voices which, in my view, made it more fun. I appreciated the lack of both R-rated moments and moral lessons. Its just a fun movie that brought back sing-along memories for mom.
031606792X|5.0|I have read the entire Twilight series and was not disappointed.   I truly enjoyed all the books and found myself wanting more. I   hated to see the series end! In fact, I also bought Stephenie Meyer's   other book called \\"The Host\\" - another wonderful book. I will put this   same review for all her books. Stephanie certainly deserves way more   credit than the juvenile reviews I have seen on amazon. Whoever wrote   those bad reviews was obviously very jealous. I look forward to seeing   the movie and possible future movies. Stephanie, I know you read these -   I love your work and look forward to seeing what else you create.   For some of the other reviewers that over analyze everything - my advice  to you is to chill out and just enjoy the fantasy. It is what it is.
B001BTG3OQ|4.0|I would give this 4.5 stars. I am a professional photojournalist, and I work my lighting equipment really hard, and in pretty freezing conditions much of the time. I have been using it both as a master and remote to photograph things like snowboarding competitions at night, etc., and I have used it at the highest possible sync speed (1/250) over and over, and for me it has never overheated. It works beautifully on camera, as a master, and as a remote, I like using it with a pocket wizard and it is amazing. I especially like the controls, so smart, didn't have to learn anything new for it. Nice green indiglo type backlight, and it's also cool that it comes with a small book of gels, a diffusing dome, a gel dome/holder, and a case that holds all of it. This flash is a beast, it's larger than any speedlight I've ever used, but its worth it for the kind of light this can produce, big step up from the 800. It is expensive though for sure. I have also been experimenting with it for studio type lighting and it definitely can hold its own in that usage too!
0312383320|4.0|I realize that a lot of Evanovich readers refer the \\"number\\" novels, but I've had to work to finish the last few. They seem like the plots are written to make sure that all the characters we expect to see have been given a set amount of space, no more or less. Thanks God Grandma was kept on the sideline this time!    What I liked about Plum Spooky was the way Evanovich seemed to let her hair down and write a book that was as funny as the first few in the series. Several of the gags in the book made me laugh out loud and that hasn't happened during one of Stephanie's outings lately.

B001G9F9IW|1.0|Woody Allen has been known for his greats and his not-so-greats.  This movie is an example of the latter.  This is not to say that this film is not cinematically beautiful; the composition, the locations, and the choice of a warm tone throughout certainly provide a bed for romance to ensue.  However, too much forced dialogue and a poor, pre-pubescent sounding narrator who ends his sentences too sharply prevent the sheets from ever getting tossed.     Allen does not allow silence to play its part in the film or allow his audience to play out the thoughts of the characters.  He believes that with enough words you can describe the emotions each character is feeling.  He gives his actors too many lines to remember that are written to be spoken to the audience and not to one another and consequently the acting suffers.     These facts are undeniable and I invite the prior reviewers who gave this film high marks to reconsider their thoughts on this film given my review.     All too often we want to believe a film is good because we've invested our money, time, and sometimes high expectations and hopes.  When we're let down, we unconsciously play devil's advocate to protect ourselves from being outcast and victim of comments like,  \\"How can you not like this film?  It's directed by Woody Allen!\\" and the like.      As for story?  In short, predictable.

B0007VZ91C|5.0|I can and have listened to Deva Premal's Dakshina all day long on more than one occasion. It calms and elevates my heart and mind, soothing troubled and angry thoughts.  Another interesting thing about this CD is that it complements mental work very nicely.  I have used it when addressing problems in database design and I assure you I find myself able to focus better and work longer while listening to it. Deva Premal's voice and the instrumentation on this CD are a presence that can either take center stage, charm, and reward your attention or sublimate itself into an atmosphere that sustains and nourishes as necessary.
B001L5SXQG|4.0|I like this CD and his last one, Magic. I know when you get old you mellow, but the past few albums seemed to have new life in them. I think Bruce is under-rated these days due to the Jonus Brothers and stuff U2 and Dylan keep putting out. But give these songs a chance, or better yet go see him live where he really shines.
B000PTYPAC|4.0|There's no denying it, Paramore is an exceptionally talented band.  Their lead singer, Hayley Williams, has an amazing set of pipes, their guitarist Josh Farro plays some killer riffs, and the two of them together write some fine songs.  They also manage to get in the edgey guitar and other instruments while allowing Hayley's voice to shine through.  Too many bands that do have good singers make the mistake of overpowering the vocals with the instruments.  Paramore gets it just right.  They're one of the few bands like that.  \\"RIOT!\\" is one of the better albums in my collection and my only real complaint is that there aren't more songs.  Paramore is at their best when doing up-beat teen angst type songs with heavy guitar riffs such as \\"For A Pessimist, I'm Pretty Optimistic\\" and \\"Misery Business\\".  The ballads such as \\"When It Rains\\" and \\"We Are Broken\\" tend to be RIOT!'s weakpoints but are still good.  They also help to give the album some balance, since no one likes a cd where all the songs sound the same.       1. For A Pessimist, I'm Pretty Optimistic---  Great song to kick off the album.  It's nice and fast and has a strong opening.  It's incredibly fun to sing along to.  It has pretty good lyrics too.  Despite being a song about bad-mouthing an ex, the lyrics manage to be at least somewhat original.  I don't have any thing bad to say about it, except for the part where they rhyme \\"about it\\" and \\"about it\\" in the bridge.  It's little, I know, but these things bug me.     2. That's What You Get---   I love this song.  Parts of it are kind of confusing but the point is that she's complaining about the mess she's gotten herself into over a guy.  The chorus says it all \\"That's what you get when you let your heart win.\\"  I wish they would've put more actual words in the chorus instead of letting half of it be filled with whoas, but on the flip side those same whoas show off Hayley's voice rather well.  They're also fun to sing along to.  It has a cool sounding drumpart as well.      3. Hallelujah---  If you want to hear the voice I've been raving so much about, go find this song.  It probably showcases Hayley's vocals better than any other song on the album.  Other than that, the song is good but nothing special.  Still, it offers that good solid power ballad that most good rock albums have.    4. Misery Business---  It's a song that basically says \\"You may have stolen my man but now that you dumped him he's hanging out with me and we're having so much fun without you.\\"  Now that's what you call teen angst at it's finest.  I usually don't like these types of songs but I've never heard anyone do them as well as Paramore.  The opening guitar riff is extremely catchy and you will probably find yourself humming it after you listen to it.  Between that and the solo later in the song, the guitar is probably the best feature of this song.  Unfortunately, Hayley's voice doesn't really excel the way it's meant to as the verses are pretty mono-tone and almost rap.  Overall, it's a fun-to-listen song even if it is pretty shallow.        5. When It Rains---  After the first four songs, this one sounds a little out of place.  There are no edgy guitar riffs, in fact the song really has no edge at all.  Unlike some of the other songs that only take one listen to get you loving the song, I think you have to listen to it a few times before you can really appreciate it.  It definitely shows more vulnerability than any other song on the album.      6. Let the Flames Begin---  This is one of my least favorite songs on the album.  It's pretty mediocre lyric wise (I still haven't figure out what it's about) and the music isn't much better.  Well it's still a good song, it's just not one of the ones that you're going to remember off the album; not one the ones that will get stuck in your head.  What's the term we give these types of songs: filler.  But as filler goes it's pretty good.  As regular songs go, it's not.  I definitely like the chorus better than the verses.      7. Miracle---  This is one of the best songs on the album.  It's one of the songs where they got everything right, lyrics, music, everything was perfect.  It's one of the deepest songs on the album that still makes sense.  \\"Let the Flames Begin\\" is probably deep to, but like I said I can't really decide what it's about.      8. crushcrushcrush  This is one of the more popular songs off the album, but not necessarily one of the best.  While it is catchy and fun to listen too, it's pretty weak lyrically.  I like the bridge where she goes \\"Rock `n roll, honey\\" and I don't really know why.      9. We Are Broken---  This song is another one of my least favorite on the album.  It does have good lyrics but it sounds too much like a lullaby to be interesting.  Since it's not very interesting people don't really notice the lyrics.  Well I can give Paramore credit for being versatile I'm not sure that I really want to hear more songs like this from them or not.  Part of me wants them to keep trying these kinds of songs because I don't want them to be one of those bands where all they're material sounds the same.  The other part of me says they should stick to what they're best at, and \\"We Are Broken\\" isn't it.    10. Fences---  Usually I don't like it when famous people sing about being famous, but this one isn't too bad.  It's not as snobby as most songs about being famous are.  No \\"everyone wishes they could be like us\\" or \\"We're better than you\\".  The best description would be \\"A day in the life of a famous person.\\"  I like it, but it's not one of the standouts.    11. Born For This---  Possibly the all around best song on the album.  It has great lyrics, is fun to listen and sing along to, and a kick-butt guitar part.  It also leaves you feeling good, which is something I think every last song on an album should do.  I always hate it when bands make the last song on their album sad and depressing, as Simple Plan did with \\"Still Not Getting Any...\\", All-American Rejects did with \\"Move Along\\" or Good Charlotte did with \\"Chronicles of Life and Death\\" (although the last has been good about this with all their other albums).  Paramore definitely got it right with \\"RIOT!\\".      I like this album.  There is no doubt it is aimed at a young audience, I recommend it for teens and young adults who like the teen angst sound, but I doubt anyone over 30 will like it too much.
038073186X|5.0|In the beginning I thought it was a little slow and I didn't really understand what was happening, but this can be expected of any book.  Then once the action starts I couldn't stop reading.  Lehane has a great rhythm to his writting and his characters are gripping, but the plot of the story is what separates him from other writers, it sucks you in and doesnt let you out.  Great book and now my favorite author after reading the kenzie/genaro series.

0634049011|4.0|I definitly saw the patterns on the fretboard after, where there was just massive confusion before.  If you know just a little bit of theory to start, you should have no problems getting through the excercises.  In fact, the book will pretty much complete your theory training by the time you finish.  You will end up having the knowlege to create any chord anywhere on the fret board.  Pretty cool results for not to much time vested.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|This is one of the funniest shows I've ever seen. That being said, it has very sweet and sad moments. Joss Whedon is such an amazing writer. I loved every minute of this! Neil Patrick Harris plays Dr. Horrible perfectly and Nathan Fillion is no slouch either as his arch nemesis.
B0013FSL3E|4.0|This was an excellent movie that was enjoyable for the whole family to watch.  My children's ages range from 2-7 years and they all were able to sit through the entire movie.  This is a difficult feat in my house.  The kids were able to enjoy the characters of the movie and their actions.  The adults were able to obtain the message the movie was trying to get across which was too complex for the young children to understand.  Warning: Your kids might talk non-stop about the part where Wall-e puts the bra on his head!
0451169514|3.0|Tommyknockers, The Stand, and King's later novels all maintain an internal consistency.  They may be bizarre, they may be shocking, but at least they make sense within the framework of the story.  This novel, which introduces some intriguing and well-developed characters and has a complex, interesting structure, falls apart toward the end.  The destruction of Derry in the final flood is gratuitious and unnecessary.  One of the few King novels I wouldn't rate at least a 4.
B0007VNCQ6|5.0|First off, I just love all of Haba products.  I've never been let down yet!  This game is really great!  My son is four and just loves to play it.  I especially like that he can play with it by himself and doesn't always need me to play with him!      The pieces are a little smaller than I had thought they were going to be when I purchased the game, but it's still a great buy.  The quality is great and I know we will have this for a long time.  My daughter is barely one and I know that one day she will be able to play with it too!  You can't say the same for many other preschool games.
B001PE26QQ|5.0|This is easily one of the best kung fu movie I have seen.  Donnie Yen who plays the main character in the movie, Ip Man, really shines.  He is one of the few modern day actors who actually knows martial arts.  The fighting scenes are spectacular!  Don't miss out this great movie!
B000PC6A3E|4.0|got this and dark night.  the dark night looks better but this still looks amazing
B002GHHHPQ|4.0|Memphis Belle, 1990 film<br /><br />In the summer of 1943 the Allied Air Force bombers attacked Germany, the US by day, the British by night. This is the story of a bomber crew created for the 1990s. [You can compare it to “Command Decision”.] Was daylight bombing the only way to win the war? Some say this bombing delayed a cross-channel invasion in 1943 and an earlier end to the war. The last B-17 to land explodes for a dramatic effect. Bombers dropped surplus bomb in the Channel before they landed. That idea of a chain of restaurants was anachronistic. Would those men talk about their mission to civilians? Would they drop all those balloons at a party? Rubber was a scarce resource. That box camera would have underexposed film. The sale of film was rationed in Britain.<br /><br />The assembled crews get their orders: Bremen, the fighter aircraft factory. Strategic bombing picked the critical targets (like ball-bearing factories) to do the most damage. [Didn’t they have alternate targets if the main target was clouded over?] Weren’t the planes spaced far apart to prevent collision? They are attacked. A “lucky rubber band” replaces a lucky medal. Some letters remind us of the real war. Anti-aircraft fire greets them as they approach the target. Was there such conflicts among the men as shown? The film shows actual film from the war to show bombs exploding. A dangerous maneuver extinguishes an engine fire. The damaged bomber makes it back to England. There is drama in the landing, but they get the wheels down for a happy ending.<br /><br />An Army Air Force officer interviews the crew to publicize them in ‘LIFE’ magazine (not ‘LOOK’ magazine) to sell War Bonds to buy war supplies. The credits roll at the end, a lot of people are named. While the details of the story seem authentic, the tone of the story does not match the culture shown in the films of the 1940s. Overall, its worth watching as a dramatic story. There was a real “Memphis Belle” whose crew toured America to help sell war bonds. The B-24 could fly higher, faster, and further than the B-17. It was not as user-friendly and all models were demolished for scrap at the end of the war. [“The Wild Blue” by Stephen E. Ambrose has this story.] You can compare this movie to “Twelve O’Clock High” or “The Battle of Britain” about the war in the heavens.
B001E95ZHY|2.0|OK,the trailer,movie packaging,etc.does NOT mention anything about the fact this is almost a \\"HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL-esque\\" movie!..love Rainn Wilson AND his character in this film,HOWEVER its FILLED with cheesy teeny bop rock numbers that quite frankly BLOW!..this could have been a much better movie had they gone in a different direction,such as..oh I dont know..cutting out the teeny-bopper BS!!!..IF you are a REAL rocker..steer clear or you'll be pissed!..I was totally deceived by what I THOUGHT this movie was really going to be!!WHY RAINN WHY!????..I KNOW you noticed the cheesyness of it all!!!
B00000AFFF|5.0|I grew up listening to, but not particularly enamored of, Burt Bacharach's music. Elvis Costello was a fresh burst when I was in college and we were saddled with disco and arena rock. I approached this unlikely pairing with a more mature appreciation of the Bacharach classics and style, and a mixed appreciation for some of Costello's musical experiments. Well, this one is a soaring success, even as it is one of the most melancholy albums I know. Elvis has penned a set of heartbreaking songs of love and loss and betrayal and regret, and Bacharach has put them onto wings. I had this album for over a year and oddly, it did not strike me on first listening. I cannot imagine why. The songs are wrenching beauty, and I think I have never heard better production values. If you appreciate what George Martin did for the Beatles, what Brian Wilson did for the Beach Boys, what Richard Carpenter did for his sister, you will love what Bacharach does for Elvis's tunes. I find both men at the peak of their creative genius here.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|The DVD arrived well before it was shceduled. I believe it arrived within 3 days of me placing the order. The condition of the disc was as the seller had described. I would definitely recommend this seller.

B000F4LPJ6|3.0|The book is one of my favorites, and I wanted to give a review for those curious how it handles the epic scale that is the book. The movie wasn't bad, but it could have been handled a little better. One great thing about the book is it's incredible character focus. Each and every one of the 42 students had a background and a story to go with them. Most of them were interconnected either as friends or enemies or even secret crushes (and there were numerous).    And unfortunately, this is where the movie brings its first major issue. Obviously, it can't focus on 42 different characters like the book can, but it didn't even keep the same kind of feel for some of the characters. Shogo, who was my favorite character in the book, was much less mysterious and much less cool in the movie than he was in the book. Hiroki, who was another one of my favorites, had much less of an importance in the movie than the book, and he also lost his best character quality because of his lack of screen time -- his unstoppable devotion. And the mystery of why he was hunting down the second of the two girls was played out much more in the book, though I do think the eventual scene that occurs between them was done quite well in the film. Shinji's character was reduced to almost non-existent, Shuya became incredibly whiny, and any and all background or explanation for Kazuo was just left out. Mitsuko, however, was done rather decently, and there's a scene that's in the director's cut that helps explain to those who haven't read the book a bit about her past (though it is altered quite a bit). On the upside, although they changed the teacher/director character completely from the book to the film (it is not a former teacher or any of that in the book), I like how they added more humanity and even some pity to his character in the film. There was more depth to that character in the film than in the book.    But I think the biggest issue with all of these character changes came from trying to turn a 600+ page book into a two-hour movie. And while those two hours moved by incredibly fast (didn't even feel like two hours), the whole movie felt like how the first fifteen-to-twenty minutes of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire went (200 pages of book crammed into that tiny period). It had a lot of tiny bits of information of characters and scenarios here and there, and those were always fun to catch as a reader of the book, but it still left out or altered too much. For instance, the huge explosion and the scene that leads up to it at the end of the movie occurs around the two-thirds mark of the book... not the climax. And the final showdown with Kazuo was incredibly lame in the movie in comparison to the book... not to mention because of the ending's incredible alteration, one of my favorite (and one of the most powerful, I think) lines in the book wasn't in the movie. I don't want to list all the alterations and discrepancies between the two works, but I will list one more major one that was left out: the anti-government and rock-n-roll stuff. That all played such an enormous part of the book, and besides one scene where you see Shuya playing guitar in a flashback, there's no mention of it whatsoever, and that also took away from the power of the ending, making it more cheesy because it didn't rely back on a major theme.    Now, I didn't hate the movie. I just felt that while the book had a more powerful feeling behind it, the movie was reduced to almost nothing more than a common action movie. But looking at the movie as a movie instead of an adaptation, it was pretty entertaining. It wasn't super gory or anything, and the blood was more along the lines of Quentin Tarantino (you can tell it's fake, and it's in excess at certain moments to make a point). The action was pretty good, though the character development, even looking at it from a non-adaptation standpoint, could have used some work. As I said, at least in the director's cut, the teacher and Mitsuko's characters were handled pretty well. Noriko was similar to how she was in the book (she's more of a symbol than anything), though the danger level of her survival is much more suspenseful in the book (the book plays up on her initial wound and possible infection from it much more than the movie, which takes roughly one minute to tackle that whole issue). Shogo could have been done a lot better. He's not shown enough to where you can get a good sense of his character before the big end reveal. And Shuya seemed to be more of a prop in the movie than anything. The other major characters, such as Hiroki and Shinji, were dwindled down to mere plot devices. And I think with a lot of the stuff the writer of the film tried to put into the movie version might confuse some of the people who hadn't read the book version, because there were some things that were brought up or shown but never explained.    One last thing to bring up is the music (and the cinematography). I figured, from the book, the music would be some old school rock songs, but as that whole theme was removed from the film, they used a lot of classical music or orchestral music. And I have to say, for the most part, I really enjoyed that choice. Though some of the time it was too much and took me out of the scene, but overall, I really liked how the music was done for this film. That just really struck me as something to mention. And to touch on the cinematography briefly... nothing special, though the scene toward the end with the fire after the explosion was pretty cool looking.    Overall, without looking at the film as an adaptation, I might give it a star higher. But this review is written for those curious about how it adds up to the book. As an adaptation, I would have given it a 2. As a non-adaptation, maybe a 4. So I'm meeting in the middle.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|If you want to really experience 'the phantom of the opera' get this DVD. the stage version doesn't compare.
B001GQ2TGA|3.0|I have many of her cd's and enjoy them all; some 5 stars, some 4 stars.  Whether you want to just sit back and mellow out, or you need some calming music to relieve the stress, or as background music while you're reading, her music is excellent.  I ordered this cd to play during the holidays and I've enjoyed it.  Perhaps not as well as her others, but I'd give it 3-1/2 stars.  I would have liked it more if all the songs were her originals, which wasn't the case.  However, I'm not sorry I bought it.
B001CZVVUU|3.0|Excellent sound and video.I bought this disc because I'm a big fan of Anna Netrebko. She has a unique voice and stage presence.I was not disappointed though I'm not that crazy about having the plot moved up to a more modern era.The quality of the disc really blew me over.
B000VLE3IS|5.0|I know that there are a number of Led Zeppelin compilations on the market and many would say that having all of those are just to drain more $$ out of the pockets of fans. It's ok with me though because this mix is refreshing and the sound quality spectacular through updated remastering techniques. The two cd set is a nice blend from all of their studio albums and the dvd contains material culled from their self titled dvd boxed set. If you are a beginner or collector or just a fan that loves the band like I do, this set is highly recommended!
B00009MGGI|5.0|Having seen the original series on BBC TV all those years ago, I had forgotten just how nasty a character is Francis Urquhart - FU to his friends - and how wonderful an actor is Ian Richardson. Nothing as good has been broadcast on any channel for many, many years. Buy and enjoy!!!
B001GZ6QBU|5.0|This movie is action packed, though a little more long and drawn out than I was expecting, and Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker makes the movie.  It is so very sad that we will not have this young man to WOW us in the future, but this film is a tremendoous legacy for his final film.  It is definitely a keeper and well worth watching over and over again.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|Product has great reception. Was able to find multiple satellites from indoors while setting up. Small unit, long cable. Overall very impressed.

B000RZGFYS|5.0|With out a doubt this is the greatest thrash metal album of all time. Slayer has no equal. This album changed the face of metal for ever. Tom Araya, Kerry King, Jeff Haneman and Dave Lombardo may be the best group to ever play there own brand of music. Many have tried to copy this insanity that is Slayer but none come close. This is true angry , fast paced metal to the fullest. Nobody can mathch Slayers intensity. ( Trust me i've been in the pits at their concerts) If you are looking for speed metal and furious guitar riffs that no one can copy than Reign in Blood is for you.
B000V86OKG|4.0|Not quite as good as the first season, but still pretty good.  Dexter is the best series on television as far as I am concerned.
B00005JL0I|1.0|First they made a nonsensical movie starring Peter Sellers called WHATS NEW PUSSYCAT, sooooo they figured they could get away with it again only this time they could add the JAMES BOND moniker to the title and reap lots of $$ on an unsuspecting audience. This is the worse movie I have ever tried to watch, in fact I couldn't, I had to turn it off half way through. James Bond, what James Bond?? Stupid, not funny, not even silly, with no plot. Two of my guests fell asleep after 30 minutes of viewing. Don't waste your hard earned money on this DVD!
B000OCXMAE|5.0|contrary to what some other people have written, this is true linkin park - everyone gets older, people change, they have done both to some extent, but it's still great music ...
B00081U7HC|3.0|Love this movie.  in good condition. wish it hadn't taken so long to get it.
B001LF4IA6|5.0|This album is outstanding. I gave it six full listens and I like this album. It is as good as anything the E Street Band has ever done. Don't try to recapture the past on this album.  It is fresh and not like anything done before.  It has a few hints of the old Boss but most of it is dripping with a revitalized Bruce. For the most part this is a happy uptempo album that gets better with each listen. If you like the Boss and his ability to blend verse and guitar together then this album will not disappoint.  If you adjust your settings you can hear all the horns,cymbals and drums completing each song. I give it 5 stars and it is worthy of all of them.  Give this album a listen and enjoy the reason why music is so much a part of our lives.
B0019HQIFE|5.0|I have known who John Mayer is for a number of years and have owned a few albums, but was never overly impressed.  Just not my style.  Then I caught a few minutes of his performance at Eric Clapton's Crossroads Festival.  Mayer's performance there was very reminiscent of SRV.  I didn't realize he had that style or ability in his repertoire.  Then the music service I use featured this album on their homepage and, after previewing it, I was hooked.  I purchased the Blu-ray recording of it and have watched it repeatedly.  The audio and video quality are excellent and the presentation is great.  It is more then just the concert.  It is a more private look at John Mayer and he seems to be a thoughtful and decent person.  As for the concert itself, it is three unique sets.  The first one is acoustic, some of it solo and some with one or two other guitarists.  The second set is the John Mayer Trio.  I love this set.  It has strong roots in the blues.  The last set is with a full band, including a horn section and covers John's more well known hits.  Slow Dancing in a Burning Room and Gravity are fantastic.  I discovered that I probably had not been paying close enough attention to the albums I had bought.  Mr. Mayer is a good lyricist and has things on his mind that he shares well in song.  The whole show is very enjoyable.  I've spent a fair bit on a nice home audio system and the recording sounds great coming through it.  If you're already a JM fan, you're sure to love this performance and recording.  If you're new to this artist, I think there's a fair chance you might soon have a new favorite.
B000JLSM00|5.0|You've seen the reviews for the all-time classic movie itself and I totally concur.  It is John Wayne and John Ford at their finest hour.  But you might have some preconception that this is one of those grainy, old films you used to see on TV.  Please, remove that thought from your mind.  This is one of the finest examples of the power of HD I have ever seen.  You can thank VistaVision for that, one of the best film formats ever.  Truly, this is better HD than most of the modern Blu-ray films I have in my library.  It is simply stunning.
B00000APLB|4.0|I am a long time Stones fan that just happened to give this album a listen after a long period of ignoring it.  I felt compelled to write the following.    Don't let the usual war horses on this album drag you away from it as I did for so long.  There isn't a dud in the entire track listing.  Sure we've heard them all before a million times over but in my opinion every track is a gem.  Especially the \\"El Mocambo\\" tracks.  I wish the Stones would record more live versions like these.  You know, back before MJ was obsessed with shaking his bum and actually cared about the music quality. And KR played like the devil himself (listen to the chugging guitar on \\"It's only R & R\\").  Awesome.  Probably the last great live Stones release.    And if either MJ or KR ever read this, please stop releasing live albums for the masses.  The same old cookie cutter live releases are getting boring to us hard core fans.  \\"Stripped\\" was a nice change as was \\"Shine a Light\\" but how about a tour/live release on the same tip as \\"El Mocambo\\"?  Just the band playing their favorites live without the jumbotron, lightshow, or other distractions.  If you play it, it will sell.
B001DU8T6S|2.0|I have tried to like this album, but just cant get past Rodgers voice. Bland, lacking emotion.    I wasn't expecting the old Queen. I have watched other bands lose important members and still sound good. But Queen in it's current form is killed by Rodgers.    What made Queen so much fun was that they rocked hard, had humor and just sounded like they were having fun.    This current album just sounds so 1980s. But not the good parts of the eighties.    Over and out!
0307265730|3.0|Lahiri's short stories are beautifully written - her language is simple, succinct and forceful - but her themes are unvarying. Having read _Interpreter of Maladies_ and _The Namesake_, I've begun to find her work much too predictable for my liking.
1563898586|3.0|I got this because the movie had such potential but was so bad.  I hoped this would be a much better artistic expression of the story.  While I did enjoy a good portion of the comic I am not a huge fan of the art style.  The short stories at the end which begin each chapter with a \\"recap\\" (which felt redundant for such short intervals all compiled in one place) may have been the most interesting parts.
0385751893|5.0|The Boy In The Striped Pajamas is simply written - completely unadorned - but effective and moving. It captures the main character, Bruno's emotions and the situation he finds himself in. Even though the reading level is elementary, the narration draws you into the story. It doesn't need to be more complex because, with few words plainly written, Boyne makes you care what happens to the characters.<br /><br />Some readers have criticised Boyne's main character, Bruno, saying he is too naïve for his age. Bruno may be an exaggeration of a sheltered, middle class child or he may be typical of a child raised in a more innocent era. But, either way, his naivety and his responses to events add poignancy to the story. His guileless viewpoint presents the concentration camp, where the story is set, in a stark manner. In the short time we see him, over a period of months, Bruno doesn't have a chance to grow to an adult understanding of his circumstances.<br /><br />Even though Bruno is young and naïve, he develops a strong, caring friendship with Shmuel, a boy in the concentration camp. Friendship and human bonds are the book's central theme. Unnecessary details are pared away so that the friendship and interaction between the two boys is the focus of the story.<br /><br />What struck me most about The Boy In The Striped Pajamas is the powerful ending. Without giving too much away, I was not expecting the turn the story took and was shocked when I reached the end. Usually I don't like disturbing endings but such a raw, horrific climax was the best one for this story. This book will make you stop and think. It is a completely different angle from which to view the Second World War and Boyne has done it well.
0930289234|4.0|Watchmen is a very untraditional super hero graphic novel that feels to grand for its limited length. It feels rushed at times and falls flat at the end. I do think it's a very good graphic novel but I fail to see the reason for all the hype and awards. The story starts at a good pace. I think Alan Moore thought he had years to complete the story when the story was originally released as a monthly comic. Then somewhere around chapter 7 or so it starts to feel rushed. Like DC decided to put a 12 issue limit on Moore so he had to tie loose ends up.<br /><br />The reason I purchased this book is because I used to be a big comic book fan and I wanted to read it before watching the movie. I am still interested in the Movie and think it would be a good idea to read the book before seeing it since I hear it ends differently. Hopefully they do a better job at the end.
B0017U7PT6|4.0|i liked this movie, so decided to buy the Blu-Ray. I wasn't disappointed when watching in 1080P.  My kids also enjoyed the included digital copy, that I downloaded to their IPod's.
0446605409|5.0|This book was my first introduction to this author, and now I cannot wait to read each and every one of his books! In this book, the author introduces NYPD homicide detective John Corey, who, having been seriously wounded in the line of duty, is convalescing at his uncle's home on Long Island's North Forth.  When the local Police Chief asks for his assistance in the double homicide of two of Corey's friends, biologists who worked on Plum Island where a top secret government research facility exists, Corey begins an adventure of a lifetime.<br /><br />Well-researched, this book is replete with interesting historical information about Long Island's North Fork, which is the heart of its wine country. The author weaves a compelling narrative filled with  many twists and turns that will definitely keep the reader  compulsively turning the pages of this well-written book.  It is an exciting, intricately plotted thriller with fully fleshed characters and snappy dialogue. The main character, John Corey, is a tough talking, wise-cracking hero, with nerves of steel. An alpha male who takes no prisoners, Corey is an interesting and likable character, and one that the reader hopes will appear in another of the author's novels.  I was thrilled to discover that this character appears in a number of subsequent novels by this author.<br /><br />Those who enjoy mysteries, police procedurals, and thrillers will simply love this book!
B000005HBI|5.0|I just recently purchased this cd and thoroughly have enjoyed it. Cassandra sounds phenomenal. I swear she is channeling Sarah Vaughan. This one is exceptional from start to finish. My favorites are her interpretations of the Robert Johnson song and the Joni Mitchell song.
0374531269|4.0|This book tells the story of a young boy soldier in Sierra Leone.  It takes you from the moment the rebels bust into his village and his whole family separates to the moment he leaves his country for Guinea and eventually NYC.  The story in between is so scary and you really admire Ishmael for his bravery and guts!  While I was reading it I cried, laughed, and screamed; which to me is the sign of a great read!  I only have 2 problems with this book which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  First, he doesn't explain the conflict in Sierra Leone very well.  Like what are the Rebels and the Army trying to accomplish?  Why are so many civilians killed?  What kind of government do they have anyway?  I guess I could research this on my own but a little more background information would have added to the story.  Of course, Ishmael was a young kid so maybe he didn't really understand it himself.  The second problem was the ending. It ended so abruptly that it leaves you wondering how he actually found food and shelter in Guinea and how he made it to the U.S.  Did he ever find out what happened to his immediate family and what about his aunt, uncle and cousins that took him in?  Although I do recommend this book; if the author had included those things it would have had a better ending.
B000GIXIGY|4.0|My collection of Renaissance CDs for some reason has never included Turn of the Cards. It was a bad omission. Not instantly appealing, Turn of the Cards needs a few plays to show its true quality. Then it becomes quite rivetting, with Annie Haslam's control over some very difficult melodies really amazing. The tracks are cleverly arranged with a big intro and a huge finale. Not quite my favorite Renaissance CD, but certainly a must have - even if I am 35 years late.    I bought this from an Amazion recommended supplier who did a great job.
B000002KDO|5.0|This album is solid Black gold. One of my all-time favorite albums. It really holds up to the test of time.<br /><br />But this particular individual CD may not have sound quality equal to the more modern remasters. That being said, I do think this version sounds excellent, although maybe a little bit muted compared to the more dynamic currant releases of this album available. It's a matter of taste, really.<br /><br />Newer CD remasters are better, potentially, depending on your ears and  your stereo equipment.<br /><br />Consider the Rhino Records \\"Black Box\\" remasters of all the Sabbath albums. There is a bit of controversy as to whether the Rhino's are the best modern remaster. Some say they suck. Some say they are the best ever. Audiophiles love to fight about this stuff.<br /><br />The Castle Records imports from the UK are hailed by many as the all-time best remasters:<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Master-Reality-Black-Sabbath/dp/B000005RFJ/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1233636041&sr=8-2<br /><br />And the 2007 remaster from Japan is very dynamic and sounds great to me. It has a more detailed sound, which may come through as too bright on your stereo. I can see how it could sound a little a bit harsh to some. I found it to be balanced though, with deep bass and striking transitions.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Master-Reality-Black-Sabbath/dp/B000LZ54G4/ref=sr_1_9?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1233636041&sr=8-9<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and get this great album Master of Reality no matter what, but don't just buy this solid 1990 Warner Bros version without thinking, because you can possibly get a better sounding CD pressing.<br /><br />But like my friend Carl says, You don't need a *** to know how to ROCK!<br /><br />If you are not sure, just buy it. It's idiotic to not do that which should not be not done. And this is definitely positively something to not be not done by anyone anytime, somehow, to something, anything. Definitely. Immediately. A to the JFK.
B0018KW3XS|3.0|This may be interesting to people compiling a history of dance, but I was disappointed in the old black and white poor quality film, the sets and camerawork.  It was an expensive lesson.
B001ACH4DS|4.0|David Cook is absolutely gifted and talented.  His CD is really great, and reflects his unique voice as well as songwriting talents.  I look forward to more and more from him in the future!
B001ACH4DS|4.0|Love the CD but don't like the 7 min of silence to reveal the hidden song on track 12.  It took me 3 cd's before I figured out it wasn't defective and was supposed to be like this.
B0018GRAE4|4.0|I don't usually go for the screaming lyrics, but this band has really found a fan of their style.  It's nice to get the yelling and screaming and combine it with the melodic singing.  That's the kind of music I love!    Now, I don't love every song on the album, but they're still pretty good.  My favorites have to be Salvation, The Bleeding, The Devil's Own, White Knuckles, Can't Heal You, Death Before Dishonor, Never Enough, Stranger Than Fiction, and of course the acoustic version of The Bleeding.  It's not often that I really enjoy most of the songs on an album!    The album really flows pretty well, hitting you hard from the start, easing up a little with melodies after a few tracks, then back to it to finish you off.  There's a LOT of use of double-bass pedals, and some great little solos in there, too.  I think this one will sit in my CD changer for quite a while.    I also find it frustrating how people compare this band to that band and how they sound alike, etc.  People tend to emulate the type of music that has inspired them as musicians!  If a band sounds similar in nature to another, I'd take that as a compliment to influence others with your music.  Stop comparing bands and just enjoy what's out there!  There's definitely plenty to enjoy here!
0131103628|5.0|I really did get buy this book in 1982. And lost it in a move and bought it again. It still holds up. Until you know C inside and out, C++ and C# are not going to be as understandable as they should be.
B00129H7VS|5.0|an outstanding moview with outstanding graphics and sound.  Worth every penny of the price
B001GKJ2DO|2.0|Very poor show! An adaptation of a stage play that had very poor scenery,plot,idiotic characters and poor choreography. A real dud.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Joss Whedon and friends are incredibly talented, snarky and in many ways amazing. Commentary! The Musical has a lot of inside jokes, but if you've followed along from the start, you'll get most of them. Or if you know anything about the actors involved and how they signed onto the project, etc. Plus anything with Neil Patrick Harris can't go wrong these days.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This is my favorite production of Jane Eyre.  Rochester is handsome, Jane is lovely, the acting is great, the scenery is stunning and it ends beautifully.  What more could anyone ask?
0385751060|5.0|This was an amazing story. I think the ending will surprise all who read it. When I finished reading the book my 13-year-old son wanted to read it. He read it in two nights, its that good. It starts out a bit non-dramatic, but gets better and better as you get to the end. I am not a book reader, however I truly enjoyed this book.    Jane, Texas
B001H5X7I4|4.0|This was a funny movie but I was a little disapointed, I thought it was going to be a bit better. And who cares about Tom Cruise being in it anyways? My boyfriend thought it was an excellent movie!
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|Hi,  This is, in my opnion, the deep heart of the ENYA that we all know, it has the warm of the Carribean Blue, the moves of Watermark, and the melodies of The Memory of Trees.  I recommend very high this production to all the lovers of ENYA and good music New Age overall.  Thanks ENYA for such great melodic production, the best I have heard ever since the Memory of Trees.
B001GKJ2FM|3.0|I'll give this movie 3 stars for the lovely scenery & uplifting atmosphere. As for the singing, perhaps they should have had the members of Abba singing. Meryll Streep & Pierce Brosnan singing, god help us !
031606792X|4.0|The last and final book in the Twilight series was great. Probably not my favorite off all 4 but still an amazing read.
0452289963|1.0|Bunnyrabbit4 couldn't have said it better. This was a rambling mess. I would have stopped reading it after 80 pages, but I was just waiting to see what all the fuss was about and hoping he would make a solid case.
B001E95ZHY|4.0|I didn't expect anything major from this movie, just clean dumb fun, and that's what it is. As a aging rock n roller who had his own dreams of stardom turn into reality years ago, I can relate to the Fish character as a lot of older musicians surely will. This is a fun movie. Not on the level of Spinal Tap, but OK. It's true there are a lot of cliches, but who cares?
B000AAP7FI|5.0|10 cds of boogie woogie for next to nothing; all great piano and big band [with a smattering of blues guitar] boogie; it doesn't get better than this, as far as I'm concerned. Boogie woogie has spanned the generations and musical genres, but it always MOVES and always makes you feel good! Can't recommend this box set enough, although a detailed booklet would have been the icing on the cake. Get this.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|I purchased \\"LOST\\" season #4 at the beginning of this year and could not stop watching!  It is filled with many insights and extras that will thrill any true \\"LOST\\" fan.  It also contains a very clever 8 minute re-cap of the previous 3 seasons.  I highly recommend adding this to your collection to enhance your \\"LOST\\" experience.
B000OVLBHG|5.0|This review is for this great action packed movie. Not for the idiots that try to judge it against the book. The graphics are great as well as the action. It has a super story that makes the movie a big hit. If you want to read a review on the book, then go to the book and read the seperate reviews for it. This is a review for the movie on dvd since that is where you are at,  here at amazon.
B000025192|3.0|I heard the song Kick Out the Jams a while ago and, being interested in punk rock, I wanted to hear that band that helped bridge the gap between the classic rock of the early 70's and the punk revolution of the late 70's.    Unfortunately, this album feels more like a heavy version of classic rock than an early version of punk rock.  Upon my first listen, I was thinking \\"The Doors\\" more than I was thinking \\"The Ramones.\\"  Eight minute jam songs and extensive guitar solos don't help the sound very much.  Kick Out the Jams still hits all the right notes, but not much else does.    It's an interesting album from a historical perspective, but it's not going to see a lot of play.
B0002W4SWC|5.0|Based on the novel by Helen Fielding, the movie tells a story of a single woman in her thirties, who constantly worries about her weight, is bugged by being single, has crazy friends, and is struggling to stop drinking and smoking.<br />Even though Bridget is a smart, beautiful woman, she compulsively says what is on her mind and is constantly embarrassed in public; worst of all, she falls for the wrong guys. Renee Zellweger shines in the role of Bridget and adds considerable talent to the cast of the film. Colin Firth and Hugh Grant were great for the roles of Marc Darcy and Daniel Cleaver.<br />A lovely, smart comedy and the sound track is a fabulous collection of music. Furthermore; you will discover that there is a crazy Bridget inside every one of us, she just happened to find her happy ending.....
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I was hooked from the start. I've never read the books, but it is rare that I look forward to a TV show with such anticipation. Loved the theme music and sequence which captured in montage all that was great about the series. This was one romance written for adults - who would have thought a vampire romance could seem so credible. I also enjoyed the way that current social and political debates were explored. There were so many different levels on which to appreciate Trueblood. I'm now going to go a preorder my DVD and circle the day it comes out on my calendar!
B0015AARJI|5.0|I got this @ Amazon for a great deal and it was delivered to my front door with free shipping, and I live in Alaska.
031606792X|5.0|This Stephenie Meyers books from America are really great.    I'm enjoying her vampire series and also the autobiography  of Osama Bin Laden's sex slave Kola Boof which is just as  scary as this book by was real life.     Great books from America!    Now please get us the Kindle over here outside the U.S.
B000FS9MV0|5.0|I have been waiting for this cd for a couple of years now.  I discovered her self-titled cd a few years back after getting into the sitcom \\"Still Standing.\\"  I was really amazed with what she was able to do with her voice at such a young age.  I saw this one advertised and have had it in my wish list for a long time.  I was extremely pleased with this cd.  It has a little more of a serious tone to it then her self-titled one, but is no less magnificent.  There is still a lot of joy in the up-tempo tunes.  She brings a wonderful smokiness (don't know why that word occurred to me, but it keeps popping in my mind) to the ballads on this one.  This is not a pop music cd; it is jazz and her voice is absolutely perfect for every song on here.  If you want some good, well executed, classy music, then this cd is perfect for you.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|Okay, I'm a total Janeite who adores Austen and all her work. I probably re-read each of her novels at least once a year, and I'm a high school English teacher. So I find the 1995 BBC mini-series to be the Holy Grail of Austen movies. But this one has its charms. I am not a big Keira Knightley fan, and I found her Lizzy to be less spunky and more moody than in the novel. (The director keeps showing Lizzy alone, staring into space. I suppose that should make us think she's deep.She's much more cheerful and sociable in the book.) Also the director went for a \\"grubby\\" look in this movie. Everybody has greasy hair and appears to need a shower. I guess he figures nobody bathed much in those days. The story is a bare bones version of the book that hits the high points quickly, but the movie is clearly more interested in being beautiful and poetic, and there it succeeds. The piano music in this film is lyrical and moving, and the movie has lots of interesting visual images. The director does a nifty thing with the characters' hands that I really liked. And this Darcy (while no Colin Firth) is not too shabby. Matthew Macfadyen seems to be portraying a \\"kinder, gentler\\" Darcy who seems more shy that gruff, but he's such a handsome guy and has such a gorgeous, deep voice, that I enjoyed looking at him and listening to him. So my overall impression is that I liked it for what it was, a quicker more stylized version of a wonderful story. As a footnote, I'll add that my students fall into two camps when I show them this movie: girls who fall in love with Darcy and adore the film, and kids of both genders who say they hated it because the story moved so fast they couldn't tell what was happening.
B00000JNNY|4.0|I think Etta James is a first-rate singer and love the songs on this album.
B00005MP58|5.0|I bought this dvd set to replace my bulky and worn out VHS set which I've had since I ordered them from A & E back in the day. The dvd version looks nice with sharp, clear colors and a wider screen image. I just think this is the closest to perfection any Austen adaptation has come. The movie takes six hours to tell a detailed story in a leisurely fashion. Almost all the major scenes from the novel are included, and most of the dialogue is right from Austen's pen. I've heard lots of complaints that the actress who plays Jane isn't pretty enough, but beauty is so subjective I don't know who would have pleased everybody. And Jennifer Ehle might indeed be prettier than Lizzy should be, but the only complaint I had with her was that she looked way too old. She's supposed to be 20 and Darcy around 25, but they each looked mid-30's to me. Other than that, I have no complaints with the film. I still remember anxiously awaiting each episode to come on tv, and from time to time my husband and I will still get the dvd's out and watch the whole thing again over a couple of nights. It's a good movie with a good cast that stays extraordinarily true to the novel, which, let's face it, is one of the best novels ever!
B00006FDCJ|5.0|To clarify, I do not own this particular DVD.  This review concerns the movie itself.  Plot elements are vaguely revealed in this review, so don't read it if you haven't seen the movie yet.  There is a warning in the review before any potential spoilers are revealed.    People have called this film many things, dull, plodding, what have you, but they do not understand the point of it.  This film was never meant to be an action packed romp through a fictional western ideal.    This film deals with real men, imagined, perhaps, but real in their plight and manner.  Death is heavy subject matter, and this is perhaps one of the few movies that gets the point across.  There are no heroes in Unforgiven.  It is not a director's self indulgent pat on the back, either.  This film is as good as anyone ever said it was, and is by far, the most relevant story of violence told on the silver screen.  It is at times vulgar, distasteful, and flat out cold, but such was the life of this kind of man.  This was the reality of the myth, and no punches are held in laying that fact out for the viewer to observe.    After this point, I discuss plot.    There is an evolution throughout the film, where the viewer tags alongside the main character.  At first, he is innocuous, and one is lead to believe that perhaps the days are truly over, or maybe this man isn't so bad, after all.  Throughout the film, the journey follows him, and his fellow riders, as he is laid low by the plot, forcing the viewer to identify with him slowly.  You get to know his character as a man, as varied myths of the west are smashed to pieces in action and conversation around him.  Throughout it all, there is talk by many characters of just what a real killer truly is.    This man begins to grow on you, as others talk of killing, and even accomplish it, to their own ability.  Mention is made of his devotion to his wife, and the viewer is left to identify further with him, and begin to really like him, before the bottom falls out, and the man reveals the true colors of such a legend, and the monster is revealed.    The gunfight is sudden, and the killings are meant to shock.  Things are presented things actually are in such a situation.  The viewer watches as violence fuels this character to a bitter end for others, you can feel the adrenaline flowing in his veins as he steels himself after the fight, murdering the survivors and promising death to everyone who would oppose him, right on down the family line, starting with women and children.    He knows the use of fear and blood, and you can see him slump away on his horse as the moment leaves him, riding not into a sunset, but into a dark, wet, cloudy night, rain dripping off of his hat, hoping to leave town before his spell wears off of them.    This is a film about death, and the reality of death.  It does not color over the harsh reality of the men we like to idolize.  5 men killed at the end of this film feels like 500, it weighs on you, if you let yourself be absorbed by it.  This film does not idolize a gunfighter, it obsesses, it twists and writhes with the reality of the coldness and hate that is required of a killer, and the detached irrelevance of life after the act.    If you only see one western film in your life, make it this one.
B00000G3AZ|4.0|This is my least favorite of all Austen's novels though some critics feel it's her best work. I won't take on that argument, but I will say that I found this version of Emma to be a pretty good movie that you may enjoy if you're looking for some light entertainment. If you like Gwyneth Paltrow, then you'll probably like the movie. Young Gwyneth is pleasant to watch, and she does a good job of playing a character who is a spoiled busybody but still remains innocent and likeable. I like Jeremy Northam as Knightley. The age difference in the two characters creeps me out a bit, even in the book, but here Knightley and Emma have a brother/sister sort of relationship grown from being neighbors all of her life, and it seems to naturally develop into love. The two actors' chemistry makes it sweet and charming. I have to go out on a limb here and say I was very bothered by, of all things, Ewan McGregor's hair in this movie! He plays Frank Churchhill, a handsome charmer, but his bizarre wedge haircut bugged me every time he came onscreen. So I had trouble buying him as any kind of competition for handsome ole Knightley. The rest of the cast was very good, the movie has a nice look to it, and I find it to be sweet and entertaining. My husband, on the other hand, normally likes Austen movies but says this one bores him to tears. So here in our house you've got one vote for sweet and pleasant and one vote for boring and dull. The dvd is inexpensive, which it should be since it has no extras to speak of, so you may want to add it to your library, especially if you like Paltrow or Northam.
B00005JSGK|5.0|I have watched this movie over and over again!  I think it is one of the best movies John Wayne made.
B001LF4IA6|5.0|Overall, I liked WORKING ON A DREAM.  It's not as political like THE RISING nor is it serious like MAGIC.  It's a laid-back album, which I think a lot of people want to listen to right now, considering the state of the world and country. If I had to compare it to one of Bruce's previous albums, I would say it comes closest to something like THE RIVER.  Bruce made a name for himself during the 70s and 80s, lost his way during the 90s, but is definitely back again during the 00s.  He's made 3 gems in a row with the E Street Band: THE RISING, MAGIC, and WORKING ON A DREAM.  Of the three, I like MAGIC the most because I like serious albums.  But, WORKING ON A DREAM, would not be far behind.  It is one of Bruce's best albums to date.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Awesome.  Their best album since Kill em All.    Rick Rubin is the greatest heavy metal producer ever.
079284131X|5.0|This is a truly interesting horror flick that was so popular in its day that sequels have been coming out ever since, none of course matching this one: the original.    The film builds up suspense in the beginning and then takes off once \\"Chucky\\" comes to life. It almost takes half the movie for that to happen. It stays intense from that point and certainly keeps your attention. The only change I would have made was to the end the movie five minutes earlier, but they tacked on something that wasn't needed.    The doll's owner \\"Andy,\\" (Alex Vincent) is a cute little kid and Alex does a decent job of acting while Catherine Hicks is fine as his mom. A familiar face in the '80s, Chris Sarandon, adds his talents as a detective.    Instead of all the stupid sequels, I would have preferred to see a remake done, now that special-effects have made such great advances.    Story-wise, it's just another of those silly voodoo-type stories (you should hear the explanation of who \\"Chuckie\\" is)  but is an effectively-scary movie......and it still is 20 years later!
0596522347|4.0|This book does two things so well that there is no question that you will<br />obtain knowledge and value in your pursuit of learning the visual art of presentation graphics.  First it presents pearls of wisdom on developing slides and visual presentations for business and scientific audiences. Secondly, it is a gorgeous coffee table book of illustrations from these presentations.  But, it lacks (at least for me) a coherent organized approach to learning how to present with graphic illustrations and which tools and advice to employ at what stage of developing a presentation.  It fails at one thing every good presentation must do, no matter how beautiful; to tell a logically laid out story (in this case one about how I can go from being graphically inept to being an excellent presenter with visual illustrations).  But, I give it four stars since it provides several excellent pieces of advice (well worth the cost of the book) and excellent illustrations of key aspects of graphic design for presentation and wowing audiences.
0784011680|5.0|Wow, this is one of the finest acting jobs I have seen as Robert Downey Jr. portrays the famous Charlie Chaplin. His performance includes some of Chaplin's famous slapstick moves and Downey is tremendous at executing them.    To the film's credit ,it does show both the good and bad sides to this famous man. But it's definitely biased. Just check out how they portray J. Edgar Hoover, a man Hollywood loves to hate (along with any Conservative or Republican). Hoover is pictured as mean-spirited and nasty throughout, and is even blasted in the ending credits! (His first speech at a dinner table, intended to show him in a negative actually shows him to be prophetic whether Tinseltown ever admits it or not.)    Regarding Chaplin, if the film was the truth (that's always a big \\"if\\"), then it WAS a real miscarriage of justice to kick him out of the country for having a baby he didn't produce. Nevertheless, most of the film centers around his career and his wives, most of whom were very pretty with great figures.....but too young, most of them being teenagers!    Also shown nicely in the film are Chaplin's talent, his obsession with work, his great friendship with Douglas Fairbanks Jr. (Kevin Kline), the great films he produced and the sympathy he had with the American poor. On the other side, in addition to his pedophile instincts, one wonders why Chaplin never became an American citizen? They certainly did not help his cause.    The movie sports a big-name cast, with Kline probably providing the most likable role next to Downey. The women were very interesting: from Geraldine Chaplin playing Charlie's insane, pathetically-sad mother to beauties like Milla Jovovich, Diane Lane and Moria Kelly, the latter playing Chaplin's final and devoted wife \\"Oona.\\"    Also in here are some big names: Anthony Hopkins, Dan Ackroyd, Penelope Ann Miller, Marissa Tomei, James Woods, Nancy Travis and Paul Rhys. They all help make this a memorable biography. It's beautifully filmed with a number of stunning scenes and also has a classy soundtrack. I'd like to see this on Blu-Ray!  The story's ending is manipulative, but it works. It always brings a tear to my eye.    I liked what they did at the end with the small biographies of all the leading characters and visually showing who played each one. I wish all films did that.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is well performed. Colin Firth is superb as Mr. Darcy! You literally feel his snobbery. Then you change with his character. This is an awesome rendition of Jane Austen's book.  The best by far!
B00066FBQG|5.0|One of the best and most-liked films of the 1960s, this is still a fun movie to watch today. When I saw this on DVD on a nice flat-screen set, I was amazed how good this looked. I had seen it several times before on VHS and hadn't realized how good this was photographed. It's a pity the Blu-Ray version is poor, from everything I've heard, or I would have bought that, too! The fact Conrad Hall was the cinematographer explains it. Few, if any, were better than him.    One remembers this western for several things: the two leads looking over their shoulders incredulous that their pursers seem to be always there; Paul Newman riding a bicycle to the tune of \\"Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head,\\" the beautiful Katharine Ross, the chemistry of Newman and Robert Redford as a two-man team, on and on. Those three lead actors, with the repartee between them, and the likability of each, make them fun to watch as they dominate this picture.    It's just solid entertainment and another example of good film-making that doesn't need a lot of R-rated material to make it successful. When you combine all the elements, it's no surprise this film won so many awards and endures so well.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|I received this as a Christmas gift. It is my second Michael Buble album (also have \\"it's time\\"). I think they are both great. My favorite song is \\"The Best Is Yet To Come\\". He sells a song in a way very few artists do anymore.
B00004U28G|3.0|Burt Reynolds made a fortune with these goofy \\"chase\\" movies (this and Smoky and The Bandit plus all the sequels). They featured an irreverent, comic '70s attitude toward about anything decent  and were successful. They worked because they were fast-moving generally fun movies to watch.....certainly not any great works of art.    Cannonball Run had an all-star cast of Reynolds, his good buddy Dom DeLuise, Farah Fawcettt, Jack Elan, Roger Moore, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Adrienne Barbeau, Jamie Farr, Jackie Chan, on and on....pretty amazing.    Reynolds, of course, was Mr. Cool/Mr. Macho.Fawcett and Barbeau meant beauty and boobs whom all men - especially dimwitted cops which Hollywood loved to feature - drooled over. The Japanese were made to look stupid (this was pre-PC days) as were priests (nothing's changed there with filmmakers). The movie is filled with really profound statements such as, \\"Why do we take all these risks? Oh, just for the hell of it.\\"     Yes, words to live by.    Yet, as dumb as this movie can be at times, is does provide a lot of good humor and speaking of that, DeLuise's laugh always made everyone do the same. Sometimes the best part of these films were the outtakes at the end with DeLuise cracking up and Reynolds slapping him!
0143038419|5.0|This book is deep, yet full of humor; personal, yet universal.  The author is very talented and I enjoyed it very much.  One of my favorite books ever, I think!
B000NQDC1A|4.0|Munrow published a book --which I had to find used (it was a library copy)--that is meant to accompany this set of discs.  They run through several dozen Medieval and Renaissance instruments with short tunes to let you hear easily how they sound.  The book is written in same order so you can see what a tromba marina or sackbut or curtal looks like at the  same time you listen, in same order.  The discs alone are great, but why not a book reissue with the discs tucked into the back cover?  Saydisc has a similar one disc overview of ancient instruments that is good, but this is a bit more thorough and Munrow was just flat-out the best authority on this subject.  He did a lot in his short life to keep this stuff from fading into oblivion, and was an appropriate choice to put on the Voyager disc sent into the cosmos for aliens to hear what we sound like.  An Update:  On the Munrow official website they offer a DVD set of the  series he did for British TV in the mid-70s, much of which you can find on YouTube...a perfect package then would be the DVD series, the book and this CD set. It'd be a real hat-trick for anyone with curiosity about Medieval and Renaissance music.
B001ED7C58|5.0|Listening to the album made it feel like I was watching the movie all over again. The great thing was that I was unfamiliar with most of these bands, and now I want to get all their albums!!!
0312427999|1.0|There were so many bad points to this book that I've had to limit my comments to the first and last chapters in the interest of creating a readable review. Points below (all bad):<br /><br />1. Klein whines at some length in the chapter about Israel taking advantage of its acquired experience with living in a constant state of military alert by selling its services to people who have similar problems. Um, OK. What's the problem with this? (It has been observed by the Israeli Jews many times that God gave the Arabs the oil and them the salt.) They have to find *something* to sell to generate income. For that matter, lots of military technology in many other places and times has been developed as a result of war. This is not the first, nor will it be the last. So what's the issue here? Is there an issue here?<br /><br />2. This book is essentially repackaged Chomsky. It's an extension on his \\"military industrial complex\\" idea. Ok. So some countries get some of their economic output from military affairs. So now what?<br /><br />3. Klein compares China, Iraq and Chile. But these are all very different cases. China had a really rough experience with forms of government other than free markets and they have first hand experience of why that is not a good idea.<br /><br />4. The author talks about the private school system that was put into place as a result of Katrina. But she doesn't say anything about the peformance of schools before OR after. So....she starts from the position that markets are inherently bad things (even though they create people with enough income to buy rubbish books like this one), but doesn't give us any examples of any results before or after such things were instituted. Getting back to the China issue: Has China gotten such bad results that they have decided to repeal all of Deng Xiaoping's policies? (They were instituted in about 1979, so the Chinese have had plenty of time to see if they were bad ideas.) Or have they gone further in the direction that Deng started?<br /><br />5. What is the problem with disaster capitalism as opposed to disaster socialism?

B001AEF6BI|5.0|ok, I love, love, love this movie... the only thing I wonder is this... I have the DVD and I've watched this movie a zillion times. I have also watched it on TV and there are a few scenes in the TV verison that are different than the original movie/DVD version. The one I recall the most is when they are running through the hall and Ally Sheedy walks by the door of the teachers lounge really slow and Molly Ringwald says,\\"She is wierd... but she is cool.\\" Great clip and not in the movie version. Soooooo, I wonder why they seem to every few years repackage the same ole movie, but never give us something new like all of the deleted scenes we crave???
B0013J9KOO|4.0|del Toro always has great imagery. The creatures were wonderfully strange. The plot meandered a bit, but the background mythology seemed to be deeper than the first Hellboy. The movie tried to do too much, but the ride was a lot fun in any case. Perlman was great as HellBoy. The supporting cast was very good. The underworld was fun and strange. The themes of power, self-sacrifice and love were handled well.    In summary, I enjoyed the movie.
0684800713|4.0|It's tough to say anything bad about this a classic, always included in \\"Best Novels of the 20th Century\\" lists. The story is about a group of partying American ex-patriots living in Paris, and their weeklong sojourn to Spain. It's full of drunkenness, love triangles and assorted debauchery. But the strength of the novel is the style. Although the book was originally published in 1926, it still feels fresh. Sure, some of the language and details are dated, but it's hard to miss how much Hemingway's style influenced modern writing. It's sharp and insightful, with crisp dialogue and characters that are all relatable in one way or another. While I wouldn't put it on my list of favorite books, the style alone is worth the read.
B000QUU2Y8|4.0|First things first: I recently saw the instructive \\"Kraftwerk and the Electronic Revolution\\" DVD documentary, and in it a bunch of Germany's so-called \\"Krautrock\\" scene is discussed, including of course Kraftwerk, Tangerine Dream, Klaus Schulze, Neu!, Can, etc, but also a number of bands with whom I was less familiar, or not familiar at all. Kluster (later renamed to Cluster) is one of those bands, so I started reading up a bit on these guys, and ordered this CD.<br /><br />\\"Zuckerzeit\\" (1974; 10 tracks, 38 min.) is somewhat of a curiosity. Band members Hans-Joachim Roedelius and Dieter Moebius were at a crosspoint in their career, and for this album rather than the full-blown space rock one might suspect, Roedelius and Moebius each contributed 5 racks, ranging from 2 to 6 min. Moebius seems to be the pushing the band into a further experimental direction, check out \\"Rote Riki\\", by far the longest of the tracks here, and also the most abstract piece. I love it. Roedilius' pieces remind me more of the latter days of Tangerine Dream, almost new age-like. Check for example \\"Rosa\\" and \\"Hollywood\\". Not bad, but not terribly engaging or demanding either. His \\"Fotchi Tong\\" and Marzipan\\" tracks are much better, though.<br /><br />In all, this is not a bad album, but not a great one either. I will be exploring more of the Cluster albums in the near future, in particular  and can't wait to see where that will lead me, but I've got \\"Cluster II\\" and the Eno-collaborations on my radar screen already.

B0007CNXUK|3.0|This is a lushly photographed, but ultimately rather flat film. Although it has a lot of star power, most of its popular actors fail to shine. Dustin Hoffman actually manages to be uninteresting as the long-suffering Producer of James Barrie's plays. Kate Winslet comes off as the somewhat conventional, dreary mother of a host of boys. Only one of these boys is allowed enough screen time to become a distinct character. Julie Christie appears as a one-dimensional harpy for most of the length of the film. Johnny Depp himself seems rather languorously abstracted into the fantasy world he periodically occupies with the boys.     Part of the reason for the actors' failure to give spark to their characters - might be that perennial pressure Directors are now under to maintain pacing. There is a Director's Commentary on this DVD, which is itself somewhat flat, but still probably worth listening to if you have the time. In this Commentary, Marc Forster tells how much of author James Barrie's biography he was compelled to cut in the interests of \\"keeping things moving.\\" Some of the omissions he alludes to might make viewers wish that, instead of this movie, they had attended a performance of the \\"Lost Boys\\" play from which parts of \\"Finding Neverland\\" are loosely adapted.    For example, Depp (as Barrie) is seen briefly chatting with a man on the sidelines of a cricket game. The scene will probably completely fail to register with most viewers. But then the Director tells us that this fleeting exchange actually was the ten-second glimpse the film afforded into the abiding friendship between Barrie and Arthur Conan Doyle, inventor of Sherlock Holmes and himself a dedicated researcher into the mostly imaginary worlds beyond the veil. The scene would have been much more interesting if it had been given more time and detail. That's true of so many scenes.    Then the details that the Director did labor to include don't seem to count much. He points out how he would present two subtly different views of a setting or a character's dress. First we see Julie Christie's dress as it really is, Then when we turn back and see it again, it has changed ever so slightly, to reflect Barrie's heightened, imaginative view of it. However these changes are in fact so subtle, that it's doubtful they are registering, even subliminally, on most of us. It might have been more effective, more moving -  to just dwell on and flesh out the initial reality of the various scenes.    However, my somewhat dimmer view of the movie might just be a reflection of my lifelong indifference to the story of Peter Pan. As much as I like many of Barrie's other plays and stories, I was always left relatively cold, even as a child, by the play's philosophy - by its longing after the stasis of an eternal youth and by its early pop psychology purveyance of the idea that if you just believe - you can make it true. So the movie's lack of appeal for me might just be the result of the jaundiced view I've taken of the Peter Pan principle in general. Maybe those who really can believe in faeries - will find this a wonderland of a movie.
B001N5BDM0|2.0|I'm one of those people who like to track packages.  I love Franz Ferdinand, so I pre-ordered this awesome album. It even looks cool, well the part of the cover that isn't f'ed up.  Amazon decided to use USPS to ship my beloved album.  The corner is all buggered up, and the box it came in was bent in the middle. I was suprized the vinyl could take such a beating. The album also advertises that it comes with a 'free didgital download'. Well, you follow all of the instructions, but when you click download, it doesn't do anything. I checked it with a 'java script error code', and whoever was making the site, stuck the wrong commands with the download button. So much for my 'free digital version'. So all in all, Franz Ferdinand did a great job, the music is more mellow than the brit teen angst stadium rock of their previous two, but still very good.  BUT, Amazon will distroy your product, taking away from the dear joys of looking at a full sized cover, because it's got a damn bent side. I'd say that for $23.73, the digital version should work! Also, minor pet peve, if i pre-ordered it, why did it still arrive later than they said it would? I checked the shipping, it was on it's merry way to PA, was in Central OH, then for some reason, they shipped it to Jacksonville, FL. WHY? Oh, maybe USPS DISTROYED my original order, so they had to ship another one from elsewhere? Amazon should know that UPS is the only safe way to ship packages, people have to sign for them, they're insured, and they get delivered on time.

B000ZNRBK4|5.0|Note that the HB-33 lens hood for the earlier (non-VR) version of the 18-55mm kit lens attaches in the same way, by spring-loaded clips that fit into a groove around the front of the lens, and will work perfectly well on the VR lens but can't be reversed on it because of the VR lens's larger diameter. That's the only reason you need the HB-45 hood instead on this lens.     Also, to the fellow who complained that this hood is not flower-shaped: that's because the front component of the 18-55mm lens rotates when focusing. Flower-shaped hoods are only suitable for lenses with non-rotating front ends, since the \\"petals\\" must be aligned properly with the lens.    I like these lens hoods. They are quick and easy to snap on or off the lens by pressing the buttons on the sides, and do their job well. Yes, it would be nice if Nikon included them with the lens as they do with most other lenses, but for $15 or so I don't mind paying for them.
031606792X|5.0|I'd finished all three books during the winter break. It took me on average about 3 days per book. I couldn't believe that I was so involved with the novel. I needed the fourth book. I went into the large chain bookstore ready to buy the book, but not at the cost (even with a member discount). I went online to Amazon and there it was at a steal. It drove me up the wall to wait, because I was ready to find out more about Bella and Edward's fate. I got my book in good time and devoured it in 3 days. It was a great break from reality. I loved the soft tones of sexuality and the quiet intensity of Edward's love for Bella. I'm rereading the saga slower now hoping for Meyer's continuance of the story line. There is so much potential for future stories. This could really be a soap opera.

B00007LTIA|5.0|This album must be evaluated seriously by persons who are familiar with music history and theory.  Too many reviews have simply taken the form of saying that it either works or doesn't work for them, with no substantive explanation of WHY.    To allow as much room as possible for a more detailed assessment, I have attached to this message detailed comments concerning each track of the CDs, but this core review contains only a general overview. For more specific musical details, please click on the \\"comments\\" text at the bottom of this review entry.    As a long-time listener to classical music, and someone who knows a lot about the history of Western art music, I will first simply state that this is one album that must be taken seriously, out of the entire rock genre, as demonstrating that rock music has occasionally reached historic levels of artistic and musical accomplishment.  Persons who are only familiar with popular genres can and do debate forever (as seen on this website) about such totally subjective trivia as whether Jon Anderson's voice is too soft, whether they found the work \\"boring\\" or inscrutable, or whether the guitar work \\"rocked.\\"  All of that is quite irrelevant for a serious evaluation of what may turn out to be the most historically significant large-selling album in the late 20th Century rock genre.    The late 20th Century...   Rock fans know that 1973 was in the midst of a brief phase where progressive rock actually produced top-selling albums such as this originally was.  But a larger view of western music would identify it as a period in which some of the last pre-war master composers were writing their last works (Dmitri Shostakovich died in 1975, Benjamin Britten in 1976...) and when several phases of innovation were taking place: (1) the exploration of total serialism, especially inspired by certain late works of Anton Webern, (2) the avant garde - of the style of Penderecki and Ligeti and Xenakis, in which sound collages and mosaics emphasized new types of tone color as well as new techniques of instrumentation and electronic sound production, as informed by the harmonic accomplishments of pre-WWII composers such as Schoenberg and the Impressionists, and (3) minimalism, in which small musical phrases are repeated and manipulated with few radical variations so as to better realize the significance of each melodic phrase and also to help make music more accessible to mainstream listeners again, and still also to avoid re-using many of the then-standard types of large-scale forms and thematic development procedures, in favor of smaller-scale contrasts between specific and repeated musical ideas.    What is the place of rock music within this scheme?  If we ignore for a moment the often artificial distinction between art music and popular music, I consider that the practically all the \\"popular music\\" of the second half of the 20th Century has been rooted in exploring the following three innovations:  1. The use of electronic instruments and recording technologies (laboratories had been set up, particularly in Germany, for the formal examination of these innovations, but the relatively small scale and formal nature of that exploration made progress somewhat slow and limited in comparison to the experimentation that occurred with the use of electronic instruments and amplification in rock music and some kinds of jazz.  This especially became true by 1965 and afterward, when the Beatles used their popularity and creativity to start bringing some of these new electronic sounds into the mainstream, with their Abbey Road, Sgt. Pepper, and White albums.  The \\"progressive rock\\" genre was made possible by the successful reception enjoyed by these Beatles albums.    2. A more thorough exploration of the types of sounds producable by the human voice.  While some of these sounds, in the recordings of some pop/rock groups, can justly be accused of being childish and amateurish and crude in nature, nevertheless popular musics as a whole have been exploring as fully as possible all the types of sounds producable by the human voice, as well as all types of human voices.  The use of electronic amplification and the advance of recording technologies made this exporation possible on a large scale, and it still continues to this day with the \\"new\\" subgenres of rap and hip-hop.  Far too often, people reject a band on the basis of its singer's tone, without really considering the quality of the band's music overall.  Tons of famous rock bands can be criticized for not using singers who've received \\"sufficient\\" formal training, with the unfortunate result that a lot of interesting music gets dismissed and ignored by those who do research and write textbooks.  In the meantime, the untrained go in circles about why Robert Plant's voice is more tolerable than Mick Jagger's, or Mick Jagger's is \\"more expressive\\" than Paul McCartney, or why Bob Seger is a better rocker than Jon Anderson.  All of that is trivia that will be forgotten in the historical perspective 100 years from now, in which the stylistic similarities of all their music is what will be most obvious... not their vocal differences.    3. The development and use of rhythmic innovations.  This is especially true for those who label jazz and world musics (as well as rock) as part of the world of \\"popular music.\\"  Pop music has indeed demonstrated its rhythmic sophistication, and jazz has earned a place in our universities.  Whether Led Zeppelin or Rush, L.L. Cool J or Yes, or the Lion King, rock/pop/rap bands have been using lots of different types of syncopation, rhythm (including polyrhythm) and meter (including polymeter) and have done so in ways that have gained much more attention than contemporaneous classical works for percussion ensemble, or tape/electronics, or orchestra.  Often, the rhythmic aspects of \\"pop\\" music are far better integrated into the work as a whole.  (It might be likened to the middle ages, in which rhythm was for secular/profane works while non-rhythm was for artful and sacred works.)  Electronics have also proven valuable in developing rhythmic complexity past the point where humans could reasonably be expected to organize such sounds in live performance, as well as to place recorded sounds into such electronically-generated rhythms.    This album fits within this broader context in the following ways:  1. The rock genre makes heavy use of ostinato motifs that can be conceived of as a variant on the style of minimalism.  The fact that rock music uses a frequent repetition of melodies, as part of its structure, should not be considered a weakness of the music (at it would have in the days of Schoenberg and Ravel's \\"Bolero\\") but rather a defining part of its style and formal organization.  One does not justly criticize Mozart or Haydn for including a repetition of the exposition section in a symphony, since it was part of the style of the day, and in accord with the aesthetics of the time.  Similarly, this album \\"Tales From Topographic Oceans\\" should not be criticized for using ostinato motifs as a backdrop to the main musical ideas and their developments, because that is a part of the musical trends that were being utilized at the time (including classical \\"minimalism\\").  Such ostinato should be considered the equivalent of the basso continuo in Baroque music.  One doesn't properly criticize Baroque music for the presence of a harpsichord.    2. This album \\"Topographic Oceans\\" has a symphonic conception... not in terms of the \\"classical period\\" symphony that uses strict sonata form, but rather in terms that are more appropriate for the late 20th Century.  It has 4 large movements, with a thematic tie unifying the entire work, and although not using an orchestra for instrumentation, the sounds of the rock (chamber) ensemble prove sufficient to provide a symphonic scale to the sound (tone color), purely because of the late 20th Century innovations in electronic instruments and sound production.  Also, as a late 20th Century work, the album makes use of dissonant chords and chromatic melodies and modulations, although usually with enough repetitions to make their point clearer to listeners in a way that most pre-WWII music tended to avoid.  There are also many musical ideas that are fundamentally rhythmic rather than melodic, again in tune with broader 20th Century trends.    3. The vocal style frequently focuses on the use of falsetto voices, which should not be criticized from the standpoint of any particular cultural or gender preconceptions, but accepted on its own as part of a legitimate musical choice within the period/style of music this work represents.  If one doesn't complain about the lack of classical voice training in the singers, but accepts the singing style as one of the options made possible by electronic amplification, the voices are a vital and often appealing part of this work.    4. The Yes musicians may be numbered among the important innovators in electronic music of the time... especially Rick Wakeman...although the focus is obviously more on the use of new technologies than necessarily on the quality of composition.  Nevertheless, the innovative sounds on this double album include two things of probable historic significance: (1) electronically-produced soundscapes (in track 2) of the form that would later be called \\"New Age\\" music, which became an entire subgenre in itself, and (2) an electronically-engineered rhythmic section (late in track 4) that has much in common with what would later be called \\"industrial\\" or \\"mechanical\\" music, which became an entire subgenre in itself.    5.  The band \\"Yes\\" proved capable of playing and merging many different \\"pop\\" styles when it wanted to use them.  Their first two albums were heavily jazz-inspired, the next two were heavily folk-inspired.  The \\"Close to the Edge\\" album was a very carefully balanced mixture of diverse guitar styles, vocal harmonies, rhythmicsophistication, larger-than usual formal structures (for the \\"pop\\" genre), and intriguing lyrics.  As such, it has rightly earned widespread praise.  This \\"Topographic Oceans\\" album has suffered undue criticism for not replicating the precise balance that was enjoyed by many on other albums of the band.  The band was flexible and not rooted only in a single style of playing.  The Topographic Oceans double-album is clearly the band's most classically-leaning work, in that it was conceived and executed on a symphonic scale.  What many rock critics have failed to note is that, like \\"Close to the Edge,\\" this double-album has deliberately avoided the use of improv-styled solo parts and instead the band has taken care that, although many sections are focusing on a guitar or voice or percussion-led idea, nevertheless there is none of it that is actually improvisational in style, as the band was to include in its next album \\"Relayer\\" (in that album's emphasis toward the heavy metal subgenre of rock).  This double-album is most appropriately evaluated in terms of classical music rather than by the standards of any genre of rock music.  Topographic Oceans never takes on the consistent tone of any particular subgenre of rock music that would invite such a comparison... rather, the band uses it's trademark sounds and musician's enormous skills in the crafting of what is perhaps the only widely selling rock symphony to have seriously earned the name.  (Works such as Jethro Tull's \\"Thick as a Brick\\" or Rush's \\"2112\\" are insufficiently structured in formal terms to qualify, and works such as those by Pink Floyd do not adhere as closely to the traditions of symphonic forms as \\"Topographic Oceans\\" does.)    Tales From Topographic Oceans is in four large sections, as follows:  1. Dance of The Dawn   2. The Remembering  3. The Ancient  4. Nous Sommes du Soleil    Comments attached to this review provide additional detail to allow readers to evaluate the merits and functions of each of these sections of music within in the work as a whole.
B00007AJGH|3.0|The Bottom Line:    The special effects are nifty and I guess the Chinatown-esque plot is kinda fun, but the gimmick ran stale for me after the first half hour and I wanted a bit more to fall back on than Hoskins' growling and Christopher Lloyd's scenery chewing; I can see why everyone else loves it, but I was not especially enthused.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I bought this DVD for the convenience of having an option to exercise at home on the days I can't make it to the gym. I am physically active, going to the gym 3-4 times a week. The video challenges me, makes me sweat, and makes me sore the next day! I like that Jillian seems down to earth and pretty cool. She's not annoying like some of the other instructors on other videos I have. I gave it minus one star for the length- I'd like it if each workout was longer.
B001AK3S4Y|3.0|The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Overlong (this refers to the Director's Cut) and poorly-structured, Hellboy coasts for a while on the considerable charm of Ron Perlman but ultimately collapses upon itself; I love Del Toro, but found Hellboy to be a movie long on imagination and short on storytelling technique.
B000EF5NAS|5.0|I first saw this film in the theater and was completely taken with it.  It is one of the most perfect works of the American cinema.  Let me explain why, first the 4 main actresses in this film are each spectacular in their own way.  Kathy Bates makes her character's transformation completely believable and lovable.  Jessica Tandy is perfect with her wispy smiles and her dancing eyes.  She is a real charmer in this film.  Mary Louise Parker performs with grace and integrity and creates a real life character out of one that could have been overly sweet.  The real star though is Mary Stuart Masterson who completely becomes Idgie. It was the role of her career and she is amazing.  The movie is visually stunning and captures the atmosphere of the old south brilliantly.  The viewer is completely immersed in the world of Whistle Stop.  The script is poignant, funny, sad and most of all genuine. When you view this movie you believe in the realness of the characters and the setting.  There is not a single wrong note in this movie.  This isn't just a great story of friendship but also a fantastic mystery that has many twists and turns.  It is a movie that is full of heart and one that you will find yourself watching again and again.
B000DZIGDU|4.0|The Bottom Line:    An excellent and original take on modern warfare that presents many indelible images (the burning oilfields, road of death, etc.) and two very good supporting performances by Jamie Foxx and Peter Sarsgaard, Jarhead is a much different movie than most people expected, but it's also a very worthy and thought-provoking one.

B000RJO578|2.0|The Bottom Line:    With none of the wit and sharpness that characterized Shaun of the Dead, to say nothing of that film's hilarity, Hot Fuzz is a slow and plodding comedy that somehow lasts for over two hours despite its flimsy plot and lack of enjoyable character interaction--what a disappointment.
B001LPWGE6|5.0|It's hard to imagine a better trilogy of films more suitable for Blue Ray than the Jason Bourne movies. Each film looks absolutely fantastic, the sound is spot on, and the films themselves are masterpieces by thriller standards. Bourne has become iconic; the Bond of the new generation. Matt Damon's all-american good looks, intensity, and acting skills give the films a credibility that many movies search for but never find.<br /><br />There are so many reasons to buy this collection. The transfer quality is nearly perfect in my opinion, but I am not the type to watch the films with a magnifying glass and look for any tiny mistakes. The surround sound is simply unreal. John Powell's score really comes to life and the depth of the sound effects are fantastic. The scene in Ultimatum that takes place in Waterloo Train Station is epic and should go down in cinema history as one of the best cat-and-mouse chase scenes ever made. The storyline is well constructed, believable, and leaves you hungry for more.<br /><br />Thankfully, there is a fourth Bourne movie in the works, with both Damon and director Paul Greengrass returning to make sure it is done right. I can't wait.<br /><br />There are few movies I will watch again and again, and these make that very short list. The best trilogy since the GODFATHER movies (sorry STAR WARS fans), these are a no brainer for any movie fan. 5/5 stars.<br /><br />*****UPDATE*****02/10/2010*****<br /><br />As a commenter has noted, it is not anything close to a sure thing that Greengrass and Damon will both be back for a 4th Bourne movie. At the time of my review, that was looking very likely.
B000MX7V5M|3.0|The Bottom Line:    If you're the type of person who can be entertained for 2 hours just by watching attractive people be attractive then by all means watch this movie (and also check out Mr. and Mrs. Smith/The Thomas Crown Affair), but if you actually like plots and intrigues then take any of Hitchcock's other films before you watch To Catch a Thief.

B001B1R1HC|4.0|EMI continues their valuable Icon series with this this anthology containing all of Sviatoslav Richter's EMI recordings.  Though one of the very greatest pianists of the Twentieth Century, Richter shunned the limelight.  His public recitals were notorious for being scheduled erratically, and in out-of-the-way venues.  Like Clifford Curzon, he also abhorred the recording studio.  The fact that many of the recordings anthologized here were made in the studio may account for my impression that this is not indeed the best of Richter.  Freer and more cogent renditions by the pianist of this repertoire can be found in various live performances on other labels. Those performances may display occasional lapses of concentration or memory; they may also be recorded in inferior sound.  But Richter's genius cannot be fully appreciated apart from hearing them.<br /><br />That caveat aside, there is still much to enjoy in this collection, not least a number of live performances which show the pianist at his most spontaneously combustible.  I was particularly taken with the Mozart and Beethoven violin sonatas highlighting  Richter's longstanding collaboration with Oleg Kagan, a sadly underappreciated artist.  These are vital, bracing performances that take Mozart out of the drawing room and relish the brinksmanship Beethoven demands of his players.  The Handel suites, recorded live in somewhat cramped sound at the Tours festival in France, are also treasurable, if only because the represent an opportunity for hearing this great pianist in relatively rare repertoire.  His renditions are predictably elegant, while also conveying a remarkable inwardness in the sarabandes and more melancholy movements.<br /><br />Among the studio recordings, I was enthralled by the Schumann Fantasy in C and charmed by the Schubert A-major sonata (though more exciting renditions of both may be found among Richter's many live recordings).  The Beethoven sonatas are certainly worth having, even if the interpretations are relatively sober.  The same could be said for the Beethoven c-minor Concerto and Mozart E-flat Concerto with Muti, as well as the Schubert \\"Wanderer\\" Fantasy.  The latter is often regarded as a benchmark recording, but I prefer almost any of Richter's live renditions of this work available on other labels.<br /><br />The other concerto recordings are also of variable interest.  The Brahms Second with the somewhat strait-laced Maazel, suffers by comparison with Richter's incendiary 1960 account with Leinsdorf and the Chicago Symphony (RCA; one of the truly great recordings of this work)--though one is still awed by the pianist's formidable virtuosity.  The Grieg and Schumann are enlivened by Matacic's incisive conducting (of a less than world-class orchestra), and find Richter in a mellow, introspective mood.  The pianist finds a vein of majesty in the Grieg often missing in other performances, though I found the Schumann wanting in playfulness and a sense of fantasy.  The Dvor&aacute;k concerto, on the other hand, is a complete success, thanks to Carlos Kleiber's affectionate and deeply considered direction and Richter's decision to play Dvor&aacute;k's original score rather than Efrem Kurz's supposedly \\"more pianistic\\" reconstruction.  The Bart&oacute;k Second, Prokofiev Fifth, and Berg Kammerkonzert are also valuable additions to the pianist's discography, since they provide opportunities to hear Richter in \\"modernistic\\" repertoire of which he was a champion throughout his career.  Again, one is struck by the seriousness of Richter's interpretive stance; some listeners might welcome a lighter touch, particularly in the Bart&oacute;k.  Perhaps, too, it is Maazel's doggedly literalistic direction that weighs down the Prokofiev and Bart&oacute;k.<br /><br />One of the very finest items in this collection is the Brahms \\"Magalone\\" Romanzen with Fischer-Dieskau.  Rarely on record has this sprawling, and somewhat ponderous, cycle sprung to life more vividly, thanks to both artists' ability to sustain a sense of long-term narrative.  Predictably, EMI have omitted texts and translations from their rather skimpy booklet, though one can readily find these online.  Another delight is the bracing and deeply expressive account of the Schubert \\"Trout\\" quintet with the Borodins and Georg Hortnagel.  Here I actually prefer the unusually serious approach these artists take to a work that is often condescendingly treated as bubble-headed salon music.<br /><br />Finally, a word about sound quality.  As other critics have observed, EMI's sonics vary from richly textured and finely detailed to opaque and poorly balanced.  In some of the concertos (including, regrettably, the Dvor&aacute;k), the piano is unduly recessed, so that the impact of Richter's brilliant playing is reduced.  Elsewhere (in the Handel  principally, but also in the Beethoven and Schumann solo works) the piano tone can harden at higher dynamic levels.  At their best, however, the EMI engineers have managed to capture the deep resonance and subtle coloration of Ricther's unique tone.<br /><br />How, then, to evaluate this massive collection?  Regrettably, on the basis of the foregoing considerations I am constrained to give this a qualified recommendation.  The Handel, the Dvorak, and the Brahms *Magelone* are invaluable additions to the Richter discography, and a good case could be made for including the Bartok, Prokofiev and Berg in this category.  One welcomes the inclusion of the live recordings with Kagan as well, despite somewhat harsh sonics.  The Beethoven, Schubert and Schumann are mostly superb, but then one can find more involving live renditions of the same repertoire--despite occasional flaws--on other labels (every Richter fan should check out the \\"Richter live from Kiev\\" series).  If you are a Richter enthusiast, this modestly-priced box certainly beckons; on the other hand, if you have not yet encountered his artistry, or are looking for a \\"basic library edition,\\" I would look elsewhere.<br /><br />Brilliant has come up with an outstanding bargain-box anthology of Richter's Beethoven, Liszt and Schubert in live performances from the \\"Russian Archives.\\"  DG and RCA have issued invaluable two-CD packs including some of the pianist's very finest solo recital material.  Decca/Universal have recently reissued in single-CD increments the \\"Authorized\\" collection once available on the Phillips label.

If it comes down to a single CD with which to start a Richter collection, I would choose his famous recording of the Brahms Second concerto with Leinsdorf on RCA.  After nearly fifty years, that recording never ceases to astonish for its formidable virtuosity and brilliant insight into a work you may think you know all too well.<br /><br />Addendum:  An outstanding 14-CD collection of \\"Richter in Hungary\\" has recently been released (May, 2010) by Hungarian radio archives.

B000F0UV0E|4.0|All the Roadrunning was a collaborative effort by Mark Knopfler and Emmylou Harris and was released 2006 and contained such hits as \\"This Is Us\\" and \\"Beachcombing\\".

0596000480|5.0|JavaScript: The Definitive Guide by David Flanagan is probably the best reference possible for this extremely useful, but complex language. I came to this book with absolutely no knowledge of Javascript, and so this book was my first real taste of the language. The first part of the book deals specifically with syntax and foundations of Javascript, so anyone with programming experience can read the first part of this book and be comfortable with programming in Javascript. This section is integral for understanding the nuanced complexities of a language without having to struggle with hard to find errors. Simple distinctions of types and values were very helpful to me.    The second part of the book is a by-examples tour through the intermingled worlds of Javascript and web browsers. Here you'll learn DOM scripting, AJAX, DHTML events, and more to make appealing interactive webpages. Personally, I found this section a little harder to use, and I would have preferred a, perhaps simpler, or at least more atomic explanation of AJAX as I am still confused by the whole concept. In either case, this section covers everything you need to know about Web 2.0.    The last two sections of the book are straight reference about everything in the core of Javascript and in client-side Javascript. This is a very well organized section of the book and it helps when you need to know exactly how a certain method or class works and this section alone is worth the cost of the book.    I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants to get a taste of Javascript or for anyone who is looking towards Javascript as a way to access web programming. The book is not for everyone, but I would argue that Javascript is a very important language to learn in this web-centric age.

B0000DJZ8R|5.0|I recently re-watched this well known movie classic. Made in 1940 and starring a young Henry Fonda, it is perhaps the most famous movie about the Great Depression in America. When I saw the film as a kid, the movie seemed sort of a quaint joke or curiosity. How could something like that ever happen in this country? Today it doesn't seem so funny...<br /><br />This movie is definitely not a pick me upper, but not every movie can be a comedy or a mindless action spectacle.  The plot concerns a family of Oklahoma sharecroppers who are evicted from their farm. Jobless, with no prospects and little money, the large family piles into a dilapidated truck and heads off to California in search of work. A ex-preacher turned homeless wanderer, played wonderfully by John Carradine, accompanies them.  Along the way Grandma and Grandfather die, and one of the brothers deserts his pregnant wife. The family is close to starving. They take what jobs they can picking fruit. Finally, they land on a Government run New Deal farm and life improves a bit. Henry Fonda, the oldest son, becomes and a political activist and leaves the family.<br /><br />There is also a theme in the movie in which anyone associated with capitalism is depicted as fascist and quite brutal. Cops in uniform work for the land owners and will not hesitate to kill the farm workers if they get out of line. The land owners try to take advantage of the very poor farmers plight by paying poverty level wages. The only one sympathetic to their plight is the government run New Deal farm. So the movie is in theme almost like [[ASIN:0151010269 Animal Farm]] in reverse. This time the Capitalists, rather than the Socialists, are the bad guys.  Very interesting.<br /><br />So why watch this movie now? Well, the themes are apropos, unfortunately. Families being evicted from homes, joblessness, and lives in turmoil has again become common. Henry Fonda is a marvelous actor and this is one of his finest performances. And the specter of watching children that are hungry and growing up in such difficult circumstances in America is heartbreaking.<br /><br />When I first saw this film, I assumed the Depression could never happen again. Never say never.<br /><br />[...]at are hungry and growing up in such difficult circumstances in America is heartbreaking.    When I first saw this film, I assumed the Depression could never happen again. Never say never.     [...]
B001CTA1S4|4.0|****1/2<br />I didn't even go to Catholic school and I sat up straighter every time Meryl Streep walked on screen as Sister Aloysius, the principal of a Catholic elementary school in the mid-60s.<br /><br />\\"Doubt\\", written and directed by John Patrick Shanley (\\"Moonstruck\\") and based on his critically acclaimed play, stars Meryl Streep in yet another powerful performance. But she isn't alone. Philip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams and Viola Davis each give outstanding performances helping this film stand out from the rest of the pack.<br /><br />Set in the mid 60s, at a Catholic Parish back East, Father Flynn (Hoffman) is the charismatic young priest leading the whole parish. But Sister Aloysius, the elementary school principal and leader of the nuns who work on the grounds, has her suspicions about Father Flynn. She dislikes his modern ways, and seems particularly shocked when he suggests they include a secular song in the Christmas pageant. Sister Aloysius would rather rule over the children with fear, instilling the fear of God into them. Father Flynn would rather be kind. Aloysius turns to her flock of sisters and asks them to keep an eye open for anything suspicious. Sister James (Amy Adams) seems to take this to heart and considers it odd that Flynn calls one of her students, Donald Miller, the lone black student in the school, to his office for a private conversation. Later, she spots him putting something in Donald's locker. Aloysius immediately suspects Flynn of wrongdoing and confronts him. But she can do little else and he won't admit to anything. But she begins a campaign and will not stop until Flynn admits his wrongdoing and leaves. She turns to Mrs. Miller (Viola Davis), Donald's mother, for support.<br /><br />Written and directed by John Patrick Shanley, I get the feeling this play was either based on something he personally experienced, whether he had first hand knowledge, or later learned of such a thing happening in a school just like the one he attended. He has provided a unique and seemingly extensive attention to detail, giving us a real feel for what life was like in this community, at this time in history. From an overhead shot of the community, watching various parishioners' head to Sunday service, to moments with Sister Aloysius and her nuns, Shanley makes us feel as though we are living through this with the characters.<br /><br />He isn't content to depict just a small slice of life in this absorbing drama; he provides historical benchmarks, helping us place the story in a larger framework. There are some references to Kennedy's assassination; the children are clearly enamored of certain pop culture icons, indicative of the times. It is very clear these people populate the mid 60s.<br /><br />But the most important benchmark helps establish the history and also provides the backbone for most of the story is that Donald Miller is the first and only black student in the school. He has a difficult time acclimating and many of the other children pick on him, getting into fights with him. But his mother is intent on him finishing his education there because she knows he will get accepted to a better high school and then a better college, greatly improving his life. Hi mother's devotion to him and her absolute conviction that he finishes his education at the Catholic school provides one of the most dramatic moments I have seen in recent film. It is also the one scene in which Viola Davis appears, for any length of time, with any dialogue, and she more than holds her own against Meryl Streep's powerful portrayal of Sister Aloysius. This is the scene that got Davis an Oscar nomination and will make her stand out among the rest of the pack.<br /><br />As Streep's Sister Aloysius gets more and more frustrated with Father Flynn, we begin to get a fuller picture of her history. She isn't JUST frustrated with Father Flynn, and his encouragement to modernize the church, or his approval of including a secular song inthe Christmas pageant, or his insistence that maybe they could all be nicer to the parishioners and the children. Although, all of these things probably serve to make Sister Aloysius' head explode on a nightly basis, she is frustrated most outwardly in what she deems inappropriate behavior by Father Flynn towards Donald.<br /><br />When Sister James spots the suspicious moments, she runs back to her superior and reports, giving Sister Aloysius exactly what she needs and didn't want to use against Father Flynn. But they are mere accusations and she has no proof. So she must tread delicately at first.<br /><br />This leads us to recognize what frustrates her the most. What eats away at her, silently, making her seethe and become more and more bitter by the day? She is frustrated that she has no power in the church. The men have all of the real power. Sure, she can wield a ruler and smack the children. She can cast a look at many of the children and make them practically pee their pants. But she can't bring an accusation against Father Flynn without evidence.<br /><br />This fact leads to a powerful, extremely illuminating scene depicting the relationship between Father Flynn and the two nuns. And it shows so many levels of their relationship, giving us insight into some of the problems with the Catholic Church, problems that, to my limited knowledge, still exist today.<br /><br />Streep's Sister Aloysius believes so strongly in her convictions, she continues to harangue Father Flynn and continues to try to uncover some evidence she can use.<br /><br />Philip Seymour Hoffman is great as Father Flynn. As a man, he has the power in this church, and Flynn uses this knowledge to his own advantage. This aspect of the film was actually the most interesting for me; watching the three leads dance and shuffle around each other as they attempt to get to the bottom of information or situations, while always trying to ascertain who has the real power in any given moment.<br /><br />Hoffman has a difficult role in that he has to appear powerful, in charge, but this is clearly not the case in some moments. When Flynn even realizes this, Hoffman has to show us Flynn's realization while maintaining the character's convictions. Flynn knows he can't let his guard down around the two women, so he exerts his power in subtle methods. In a way, these displays of power are meant to remind both the sisters and Father Flynn of his own power.<br /><br />Sister James is eager to please and Adams brings a certain naivet&eacute; to the role, letting us believe she is fairly new to this work. She wants to make Sister Aloysius happy so she is very keen to help Sister get the information she wants and needs. Does this lead her to see things that don't really happen? This is part of the beauty of her character.<br /><br />Shanley has done a great job, but the film doesn't completely escape its stage origins. Too much of the film depicts conversations between two or three people, isolating them from other people and events, focusing on what they are saying. In real life, people interrupt, we hear noises outside, they walk through a courtyard, and the world is larger. In a play, everything is smaller because of the limit of space and the necessity for scenery. It is a challenge to 'open up' a play when adapting it to the screen, but the most memorable adaptations accomplish this.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. I have the utmost respect for good playwrights, but film is a very different artistic medium and adapting plays to film is usually somewhat problematic.<br /><br />\\"Doubt\\" is a very good film, but it never makes you forget it was born as a play.they could all be nicer to the parishioners and the children.

B0000048CP|4.0|This was a great disc.<br />Starts up with the atmospheric opener and then breaks into 'A Fine Day To Die'. A mid paced stomping opener. It gives the album a good start before the onslaught begins. and the production on this sound wise, is a touch better than 'Under the Sign'..<br /><br />'The Golden Walls of Heaven', Holocaust' and ' Pace Til Death' are just Bathory speed at its best. Just brutal as hell. Tough to make out the lyrics, but it doesn't much matter. Its the guttural heaviness that makes it work. 'Dies Irae' follows the same speed pattern. These tracks just burn.<br /><br />'For All Those Who Died' is another mid paced track that fits well as a breather from all the speed. Really good and most accessible track. It has a memorable yet basic chorus and riff. Reminds me of 'Woman of Dark Desires' off of Under the Sign.. Same tempo. And then there is the epic Title track. A Very long, but good song that builds nicely. Definitely the first acoustic guitar heard on a Bathory CD. A sign of what would come with the follow up 'Hammerheart'. It's a slower paced track, more in the 'viking' style. Though, I must confess, sometimes I skip it. Its a Good finish to a very good album.<br /><br />Between this and 'Under the Sign..' you get the best from Quorthon. Though later albums would be decent enough, and some would be mediocre, these 2 were the best of the best as far as I am concerned. Must have for Speed/Black Metal fans.<br /><br />The 'Kraze' version gets a D- for packaging. The cover art looks OK but the back of the inner card and back cover are horrendous! Almost looks like a bad bootleg because there is Nothing to it but the cover art basically. Not even the pic of Quorthon with the sword like in the original gate-fold LP. Just a black card is all! No info whatsoever. They certainly didn't go out of their way to make this an interesting package. Maybe the imports are better where that is concerned, so beware if you are a collector. Get a different version.<br /><br />I personally don't think it sounds bad at all. It never was well produced, but it comes off fine. Definitely not remixed or anything. Obviously the label put no money into this, but it still sounds like the original, just the packaging is horrible.nds bad at all. It never was well produced, but it comes off fine.

B001GCUNVW|3.0|\\"The Wrestler\\", the new film from director Darren Aronofsky (\\"Pi\\", \\"The Fountain\\") is a good film. And it contains a good performance from Mickey Rourke as Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson, a former professional wrestler who now makes a living appearing in smaller venues, letting his body get hit and abused and violated in all and every manner, so he can eke some dollars and maybe a little glory out of the profession he still loves.<br /><br />But \\"The Wrestler\\" is easily one of the most over rated films of the year. Because it stars Mickey Rourke, who, lets face it, is a strange guy who has made a lot of terrible films, and he is good in the role, everybody seems to be genuflecting at his feet, proclaiming this the performance of the year. For me, that honor goes to Sean Penn in \\"Milk\\". Rourke is good, but because we are so used to him being mediocre or terrible, many people seem to mistake his good performance for something great.<br /><br />Randy is a man who is too old to be performing in wrestling matches, but he appears in gyms and smaller exhibition matches in an effort to earn a few bucks here, a few bucks there, and maintain his living. But so much of his money goes towards drugs to keep him going and to the lap dancer, Cassidy (Marisa Tomei), he likes that he has trouble paying the rent on his trailer. During one match, he has a scary dose of reality and ends up in the hospital. The doctors tell him he can't wrestle any more, if he does, he could die. This is a big moment for Randy and suddenly causes him to become even more reflective than normal. He begins to wonder about his adult daughter, Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood). Cassidy urges him to make contact so he drives out to where she is living.<br /><br />Part of the problem I have with \\"The Wrestler\\" is that it is so damn predictable. If you have seen any film about a down on his luck athlete who is struggling to survive, you will be able to predict the outcome of each and every one of these storylines. From the Lap Dancer with the heart of gold, to the daughter who is extremely reluctant to reconcile with her dad, to the former sports hero eager to relive a moment of glory, you can figure it all out way before the individual stories come to a close. You can even figure out how certain stories will shape up and what will make them change. Darren Aronofsky is, if nothing else, a filmmaker who seems to try to make films that are unlike anything we have ever seen before. For good or bad. So why is \\"The Wrestler\\" so much of a throwback?<br /><br />The film redeems itself considerably with the performances of Mickey Rourke and Evan Rachel Wood.<br /><br />Again, Rourke is good. Not great. There has been a lot of press about how similar the character is to Rourke's own life. I can't say that I have followed his career (or lack thereof) over the last few decades, but Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson is a professional wrestler, and a former star, so there is a certain amount of similarity between his life and the strange odyssey Rourke has been on. And the actor throws himself full force into the role, making it seem real and believable. It is interesting to see someone who has appeared primarily in straight to video films over the last few years (with the exception of \\"Sin City\\") turn in an interesting, believable portrayal of a man trying to reclaim a few minutes of glory, trying to set things right.<br /><br />Rourke's body and face fit the character perfectly and he has added long, greasy died hair to make the change complete. Sporting skintight spandex costumes, he meets with each of his opponents before hand and they go over the routine they are about to perform. Each of his opponents is clearly honored to work with the one time great Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson. So it is sad to see him receiving a small bundle of twenties for his appearance, after he has knocked himself out.<br /><br />I think the closest analogy I can come up with is when Tarantino decides to use on of the actors who he loves in a new, career-defining role. There is a certain electricity when we watch John Travolta, Pam Grier, David Carradine or Robert Forster playing roles written specifically for them, tailored to their strengths. The roles thrust them into the spotlight again because they are each good and Tarantino has given them a new character to showcase their skills. But do they deserve an Academy Award? No. And neither does Rourke. With the exception of a coupe of memorable roles at the beginning of his career, and his more recent role in \\"Sin City\\", Rourke is the stuff of direct-to-video DVDs. Terrible direct-to-video DVDs.<br /><br />Cassidy (Tomei), the Lap Dancer with a heart of gold, is clearly trying to do a job and Randy meets her because he pays her for some pleasure. But Randy forms an attachment to her and wants to talk to her about life, learn about her son, and more about her life during the lap dances. He even thinks that perhaps she is beginning to care for him and starts to confide in her, asking her to come out to his car to talk. Even though this is against the rules, Cassidy recognizes that Randy needs someone to talk to and occasionally steels away for a few moments.<br /><br />Tomei is good as Cassidy, but it is too clich&eacute;d to be anything memorable. Despite the fact she shows her breasts in one form or another, repeatedly, she simply can't overcome the predictable nature of her character or the role.<br /><br />Evan Rachel Wood is good as Stephanie, Randy's daughter who would rather die than reconcile with him. When he shows up at her door, she looks like she has just seen a monster from a horror film come to life. She tells her partner (I'm guessing on this point as the story never tells us who exactly the woman is) she can take care of it and goes outside to talk with him. He pleads with her to give him a chance and she is extremely reluctant. After they talk a bit and he opens up to her, she begins to let her defenses down. They set a date to have dinner on Saturday night.<br /><br />For me, the most interesting aspect of \\"The Wrestler\\" is to watch the various people who are competing in the matches prepare. Randy and one of his colleagues visit a 99-cent store looking for props. Randy uses two foil-roasting pans and playfully exhibits his idea to the shop owner, who seems to take it in good stride. It is also interesting to watch the reverence with which the other competitors pay to Randy; they respect his previous work, even though he is passing them in the opposite direction. They certainly hope their stars are on the rise while his is clearly on the way down.<br /><br />\\"The Wrestler\\" is good, but very overrated.rtain electricity when we watch John Travolta, Pam Grier, David Carradine or Robert Forster playing roles written specifically for them, tailored to their strengths.

Terrible direct-to-video DVDs.    Cassidy (Tomei), the Lap Dancer with a heart of gold, is clearly trying to do a job and Randy meets her because he pays her for some pleasure. But Randy forms an attachment to her and wants to talk to her about life, learn about her son, and more about her life during the lap dances. He even thinks that perhaps she is beginning to care for him and starts to confide in her, asking her to come out to his car to talk. Even though this is against the rules, Cassidy recognizes that Randy needs someone to talk to and occasionally steels away for a few moments.    Tomei is good as Cassidy, but it is too clichéd to be anything memorable. Despite the fact she shows her breasts in one form or another, repeatedly, she simply can't overcome the predictable nature of her character or the role.    Evan Rachel Wood is good as Stephanie, Randy's daughter who would rather die than reconcile with him. When he shows up at her door, she looks like she has just seen a monster from a horror film come to life. She tells her partner (I'm guessing on this point as the story never tells us who exactly the woman is) she can take care of it and goes outside to talk with him. He pleads with her to give him a chance and she is extremely reluctant. After they talk a bit and he opens up to her, she begins to let her defenses down. They set a date to have dinner on Saturday night.    For me, the most interesting aspect of \\"The Wrestler\\" is to watch the various people who are competing in the matches prepare. Randy and one of his colleagues visit a 99-cent store looking for props. Randy uses two foil-roasting pans and playfully exhibits his idea to the shop owner, who seems to take it in good stride. It is also interesting to watch the reverence with which the other competitors pay to Randy; they respect his previous work, even though he is passing them in the opposite direction. They certainly hope their stars are on the rise while his is clearly on the way down.    \\"The Wrestler\\" is good, but very overrated.

0800141660|5.0|If you like the work of Jane Austen and Ang Lee ,you'll love this one !The acting, directing, and cinematography are superb !! I watch this movie at least 3 times a year and never get tired or bored.It's at a very good price and definitely worth the investment.I like ordering through Amazon.com because the items are reasonably priced and arrive on schedule.
0679413251|5.0|After I ordered this book, it was at my house in about four days. I haven't been able to finish it entirely yet because of other school books but I'm about half way through so far and it's amazing! I would recomend this book to just about anyone. This hardcover in particular looks beautiful! Since I got it, ive had at least ten random people at school comment on how beautiful it looks. Bottom line, It's an awesome book and you should get it!
B000WMFZMY|5.0|Having a great film in such a good reproduction is fantastic.  the color & the sound were as good as a theater.  And Amazon sale price was the topper.  This was the first time I ordered, but it won't be the last.
0789310627|5.0|I first saw this book while visiting London, England. It cost something like 20 pounds. I decided I'd wait til I got home and order it off of Amazon instead. Glad I did - it was far less expensive. It is also a great book. Miroslav Sasek's books on different locations across the globe are great - fun art, informative and a nice sense of humor as well. A little outdated but the new editions tell you what has changed in the city since the original publication. I have actually been collecting this series of books for every location I have been to (if there is a Sasek book out there for it - and so far there seems to be!).

0783231202|5.0|I find this film to be accurate in many ways except one, the Morgan Freeman character. I think it lacks a little aunthenticity. There were not that many free blacks in his day, especially with any kind of wealth. The film does tell a very important aspect of American history, that is often overlooked which is that the northeastern United States was not an area of predominant slave ownership, people there did harbor still some of the same prejudices existant in the south.
B001CW7ZXA|5.0|What can I say that has not already been said? A true comedy classic, one of the ten funniest films ever made. And even better, it holds up well after more than 30 years, which is more than can be said of some other comedies, whose jokes and gags are based on current events. Lastly, even though you know what is coming, and often the very lines the actors are going to say, the gags are still funny!
B001KVAMM4|5.0|Today marks the 200th anniversary of the birth of Felix Mendelssohn (-Bartholdy) (1809-1847), one of the treasures of the classical music world.  I cannot think of a more fitting tribute that this album featuring Anne-Sophie Mutter.  She brings a level of energy and vitality to Mendelssohn's work I've rarely heard before.  Her virtuosity with the violin is truly without peer and sound quality is exceptional.  This stunning CD/DVD set should make any fan or Mutter's or lover of Mendelssohn very happy.<br /><br />You are buying this for the music, but the mini-documentary about the composer and Mutter's performance is a real treat as well. Don't wait -- once the lovely limited edition run sells out, it will revert a standard jewel packaging. I find something different to enjoy with every new listen.
B001IC7X2W|5.0|This book is one of the best books to understand the cultural destruction caused by missionaries and colonialism. If you have never read it, you should. The book is not long, nor is it difficult to read.
B0017I1FO4|5.0|This has got to be one of the top rock cds of 2008. I would rate every song five out of five except for Devour and Cynide Sweet Tooth Suicide (which would be about 3.5 and 4 respectively). My favorites on this cd would have to be If You Only Knew, Sound of Madness, Breaking Inside, and Call Me. The lyrics are the best part of Shinedown and the fact that Brent Smith has the best rocker voice. Songs such as 45, Save Me, and I Dare You suck the listener in and I believe there are plenty of songs like that on this cd. I would say this cd is equal to their first one, Leave a Whisper, but easily surpases Us and Them. If you are a fan of Shinedown this is a must have.
B000002U8G|4.0|Ever since Syd Barrett's departure,  \\"Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\" was really the benchmark for early Pink Floyd. Much of the other material released in the late 60's-early 70's could be considered experimental..and in some cases even unlistenable. For example, \\"Several Small Species of Furry Animals..\\" from \\"Ummagumma\\" comes to mind. That being said, there was some really great material at that time, it just wasn't consistent. Floyd seemed to be finding their way for a while.    Pink Floyd's \\"Meddle\\" represents (to me) the first truly focused collection of songs since Syd Barrett's departure. On \\"Meddle\\", one can hear the sound that Pink Floyd would become famous for just a few years later... Here we have the famous \\"One of These Days\\", which could have fit in on 1979's \\"The Wall\\" in terms of shear sonic brilliance and the creepy vocal line \\"One of these days... I'm gonna cut you into little pieces\\", followed by the airy \\"Pillow of Winds\\" which will have you floating away like a lost balloon. \\"San Tropez\\" and the howling \\"Seamus\\" are both delighful and unpretentious; this is the Pink Floyd that I yearn for. \\"Echoes\\" which takes up the entire second side of the vinyl LP, is a masterpiece despite it's length. Although not as popular to the masses as \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" or \\"Wish You Were Here\\", \\"Meddle\\" holds it's own and in many ways stands the test of time even more so than some of the more commercially successful releases.
0385340567|1.0|I'm no kind of literary critic, but I had to laugh at the endless repetition of the phrase, \\"Reacher was no kind of this,\\" or \\"Reacher was no kind of that.\\" Child seems to have phoned this one in, for it's the first Reacher story that not only was I not unable to put down, I had to force myself to finish it. The plot is convoluted and implausible, and if I did not already \\"know\\" Reacher from the prior novels I would have had little clue to his character from this one. The novel seems to have been concocted as a wet dream for the moveon.com or Daily Kos crowd, replete with the wholesale destruction of American tanks in Iraq, the wanton murder of Iranian civilians, wanton contamination of the environment and wanton mistreatment of injured vets back home -- all covered up by the government -- capped off by a dirty bomb plot hatched not by Islamists (perish the thought) but by Christian fundamentalists (naturally). Come to think of it, Child's target audience really must be America-bashing Hollywood producers -- I bet this is the first Reacher novel to make it to the big screen!
B00140PK6O|5.0|Great production. Definitely a classic. Anyone will enjoy it.  It is well worth owning.
B0002IQEHI|5.0|This movie may be old by now, but it is still good.  It is a clean suspense story with classic actors and interesting locations.  It will hold your attention and you won't be disappointed.
B000YABYLA|5.0|Ellen Paige and Michael Cera are great actors!  She cute and blunt and he's quiet and clueless, but they love each other, yet not ready to have a baby.  It's a fun movie to watch, the trials and tribulations of a pregnant teenage girl.
B001L5SXQG|5.0|With almost four decades of music under his belt Springsteen has become a master song writer of many genres.  Through the years he has molded an incredible array of rock, pop, punk, folk and ballad into his own fashion.  Here we see Springsteen dapple into blues, campfire music and Beatles-like happy birthdays.  It is easy to listen to this and be upset that it is not like his 70's or early 80's stuff, but then you wouldn't understand the process that his records have shown. He has changed as a person and a musician over the last 35 years; as he should.  Would anyone be interested in this guy if he was trying to cash in on his early career success?  Since 2002's The Rising Springsteen has shown that his art and abilities have not diminished.  What has diminished is his uncertainty, being replaced with a deeper understanding of his love and need of the E Street Band.  The Boss has never sounded more refreshed.
B0000CABBW|5.0|One of my favorite movies.  It's so moving!  It's great how this movie shows how generations change, that women can do some thing men can, sometimes even better.  And how sometimes, it takes a tragedy to make a stubborn, mean, old man open his eyes.
1579126278|4.0|Mr Ferrars died a year ago, and his wife is rumored to have poisoned him.  Mrs Ferrars is then found dead from an overdose of sleeping pills.  And THEN the wealthiest man in town - Roger Ackroyd - is murdered!  The local doctor joins the recently retired Monsieur Poirot as he helps the local police get to the heart of the matter.    Filled with suspense, intrigue, and a flock of red herrings, Christie delivers the goods.  I read this on a business trip and it completely drew me in.    I picked up this particular Agatha Christie novel based on a recommendation in [[ASIN:0789313707 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die]], which is fun and beautiful reference (although note that it's about 95% novels).
1563898586|3.0|If you like Alan Moore's work because of its deep political and cultural themes, you might be surprised by 'the League.' It's a lot lighter than V, From Hell (what isn't), and even Watchmen. Unlike those books, this one is pretty much a straight adventure story, aided by some great art by Kevin O'Neill. In my opinion it may be a little overhyped but if you like a good story with good characters go ahead and pick it up. And don't worry about the Volume 1 tag, it's a complete story with an open ending leading into Volume 2.

0316017922|4.0|Malcolm Gladwell tells us in Outliers that hard work and determination form just half of the 'success' equation. The other half  which is random and unctrollabe has something to do with when you are born, what your race is, and what your environment is.    Certain opportunities are given to us depending on our environment -technological, economical, demographic, etc. When one has put in much time to be an expert in something, one has the chance to be extremely wealthy and famous, given you're at the right place and right time.    Mr. Gladwell gives evidence of this through examples and stories of Bill Gates, The Beatles, and Malcolm's (his) mother, among others. As you read Mr. Gladwell's accounts, you'll get a more complete background of their rise to fame and present status, and be convinced that one's success is partly attributable to a set of complex decisions and actions of other people before and unknownst to him.    Though the book doesn't give us common people excuse for our modest success, it does gives us reason, for me at least, to be more preoccupied with what we really like because chance might give us that one big break to be extremely rich and famous-an outlier. Another lesson at the same time is not to take life too seriously because there is only so much or so little, that we can control.    A very good and easy read.

B001NEK2GE|2.0|I have used a Nostromo n52 for about a year on my Macbook Pro and I loved it.  I don't play many games, instead, I programmed it for shortcuts in my CAD program and my RSS feeds and things like that.  It became such an integral part of my workflow, I wanted one to use at home, too.  I liked the look of the G13, the extra keys, and the slim design, so I can take it with me more easily.  And the LCD felt like it was a nice touch.      I was disappointed to find that the piece did not come with the Mac Software on the CD and, after downloading it, I found I have to keep the key profiler program open for keys to work, using another space on an already full dock.  I use the Logitech diNovo keyboard, so I have the \\"Logitech Control Center\\" already installed and don't understand why I can't just have the G13 go through that.      No matter, I started programming it.  The macro options are nice, but I would like more specific options, like a scroll or a \\"Open...\\" that will let me choose the program I would like to shortcut to (there are currently built in email, internet, calculator, finder, and quicktime player options only).  So I programmed the default settings successfully and went on to start with specific programs.  The key map showed up and everything was unassigned.  Not a problem, but when I clicked \\"Make default,\\" instead of assigning what I made the default, it went to the out of the box default, meaning that for each program I want to put into it I have to specify all keys and the joystick, rather than just tweak the default system wide settings I already programmed (Contour ShuttlePro and Nostromo n52 spoiled me by being intuitive, I suppose).    Hardware is nice, the LCD screen is good, the only thing I would change about the hardware is that I would love a scroll wheel somewhere (or an option to assign \\"scroll\\" to a key) but I knew that I wouldn't get one going in.    I will continue using it in hopes of better software, but I am sorely disappointed by the lack of forethought that went into the current programming capabilities.  (Though it did find and preload the 2 games I have on my computer, so I suppose that was nice).    Probably great for gaming, but if you are planning on using it to augment your productivity, expect some serious time waste on the front end.

B0014I4KIK|5.0|I love this artist, I recently discovered her on pandora and ordered the CD immediately. She has the throwback sound of a 60's artist. I would highly recommend this CD.
B001E5FYS8|4.0|Evidently this film has an inspirational appeal to many who have seen it, judging from the glowing reviews, and I don't want to take away from that.  We all find inspiration in our own ways, but I have to admit that this film didn't strike me that way at all, and in fact, by the time the credits rolled, I wondered if the filmmakers meant it to have that sort of resonance or not.    I did enjoy the film for what it was - an examination of the event, and a glimpse into the feelings and emotions of those directly involved.  And I thought the archival footage of the tower's construction was especially riveting.  But I had a difficult time with Mr. Petit, and how his 'dream' swept up and carried away some of the people who were closest to him at the time, as if all their concerns were secondary to his wishes.      Now before I'm pilloried as a amorphous Philistine blob, I'll say that I'm sure that this isn't what Mr. Petit intended, and he probably couldn't have seen it as such at the time.  I'm sure he has regrets, as does anyone who lives life, though like most self-absorbed people, he has plenty of justification for his behavior too.  Of course, the only people to blame for getting carried away with his 'dream' are those that _let_ themselves be carried away with it.      I rented this movie based on the reviews and the critics, who hailed this movie with all sorts of superlatives, ranging from a masterpiece to a tour de force and on and on.  The problem is that I just can't see how risking one's life on a stunt is ennobling in any way.  Much like the man who dresses up as Spiderman and scales tall buildings, or even someone like Steve Fawcett, who's search and rescue effort eventually ended up costing the taxpayers of Nevada over 1.5 million dollars, Petit involved many people in a personal pursuit that added zero value to society.  Perhaps, if he had been so intent on risking his life, then a better livelihood would have been as a firefighter.  Then, if he wanted toinspire people, he could have joined ranks with the truly selfless who were an inspiration to all when the towers fell.    The filmmakers could have ended the movie after Mr. Petit completed his walk, with a cursory explanation of the aftermath, but instead they complete the picture by allowing the closest participants to describe the destruction of their personal relationship with Mr. Petit.  This is what leads me to feel that the filmmakers may have been fascinated by the event, but neutral about the man.     One other minor flaw of the DVD is the lack of closed captioning.  Several of the participants are French, and those who speak English have enough of an accent that CC would have helped distinguish some phrases.  Other than that, this is a well done documentary - of a man who carried love and friendship up to the top of two towers, and then dashed them to the ground.

B001R10BM8|5.0|The special features on this Blu-ray release are as follows:<br />Commentary with Director Irvin Kershner and James Bond Historian Steven Jay Rubin (the author of THE JAMES BOND FILMS: A BEHIND THE SCENES HISTORY). This is the primary special feature and an interesting listen, even though Kershner does resort to describing the on-screen action. Anyone who heard Kershner's commentary for \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" (the best of all the Star Wars commentaries IMO) will not be surprised. Kershner is engaging and amiable and Rubin provides a historical perspective (while trying to keep Kershner on-topic) in what is overall a fun track.<br />Three featurettes are presented arguably the most valuable of which is \\"The Big Gamble\\" (16:24) which covers much of the legal background to the movie production and the history of the production. Included in this documentary are new on-screen interviews with Rubin, Kershner, screenwriters Lorenzo Semple, Jr. (who left the movie midway through), Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais (who finished the script) and actress Barbara Carrera (who still looks incredible). Also included are interviews with actress Talia Shire (the wife of late producer Jack Schwartzman, but better known as Rocky's wife in ROCKY) and Schwartzman's son John.<br />Also present are \\"Sean is Back\\" (8:04) which features Kershner, Carrera and Schwartzman discussing how wonderful Connery is as an actor and how he helped the movie to get made and \\"The Girls of Never Say Never Again\\" (10:07) which covers the casting of the actresses. As a fan of Carrera's I was interested to learn that her original role was much smaller (to her chagrin) until writers Clement and La Frenais entered and that the hat she wears in the movie was full of small weapons.<br />In addition are The Theatrical Trailer (1:27) and a Photo Gallery that includes 62 still photos including shots from the movie, publicity poses and some behind-the-scenes shots.<br />The picture quality as you would expect is the best the movie has ever appeared in on home video. There are a couple of instances of print dirt and scratches, but overall the quality, particularly in terms of contrast, is an improvement over all previous incarnations of the movie.<br />One area where this release scores top marks is in the audio department, this is largely thanks to an impressive 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio encoding combined with some extensive audio remixing. Dialogue is situated squarely in the center channel with a number of rear directional effects in the action sequences.<br />When Kevin McClory teamed up with the Eon company to make the movie Thunderball in 1965 he was contractually obliged not to exercise his rights to the James Bond character for ten years, Sure enough in 1975 McClory started pitching a 007 script titled Warhead to all the competing studios, but it wasn't until 1983 that Never Say Never Again actually made it to the silver screen opening opposite the inane Roger Moore vehicle Octopussy. Never Say Never Again (a title suggested by Sean Connery's wife) has on display a variation of the plot that McClory had produced over 20 years earlier.<br />Faced with not being able to include the iconic familiar gun-barrel sequence at the beginning of their 1983 Bond movie, Taliafilm (named after Shire) had to cone up with their own graphic image. What they decided upon gives the first clue that we are about to experience something different, a breath of fresh air and a good kick up the rear end to a series of movies that had become stale through resorting to self-parody and recycled dialogue and villainy.<br />Yes, NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN is a retelling of the THUNDERBALL storylines worked out between Fleming, Bryce, Whittingham and McClory. It's technically speaking not a remake of the 1965 picture though, but a different version of the story using characters that appeared in the earlier drafts (such as Fatima Blush).<br />And from the moment the screen fills up with all those 007's andthe audience is drawn in, we know right away that Connery is back and better than ever, and looking much fitter than he did in DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER.<br />The title song has been attacked by 007 fans over the years, but I actually like it quite a lot (in direct comparison with the rest of the admittedly rather limp soundtrack which was a rushed subpar effort with a production running low on funds). I have found myself over the past 20-plus years humming the theme song to myself (sometimes at the most inopportune moments) and so it has obviously become seared into my consciousness as only a catchy tune can.<br />And here we come to what is the 1983 movie's pretitle sequence. But instead of interrupting the flow of the story with yet more images of nude women and silly fluorescent effects the titles play out for the action allowing the audience to immediately find its feet and settle into the pace of this thrilling picture.<br />Of course it's not the first time that we have seen Bond killed off in the opening minutes. We saw it first at the hands of Red Grant in 1963's FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE and then again just four years later in YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE. Here Bond is on a training mission and for those with keen eyes its really quite obvious (no muzzle fire from 007's gun). As such it works a little better in the little details, and when 007 rescues the leggy millionaires daughter held captive she plunges a knife into him.<br />It is at this point that the factor of a new M really pays off. We see Edward Fox sternly watching the exercise on tape. We see another unidentified character (presumably Tanner). Its not until the very last minute that Connery's 007 is revealed - alive and well.<br />Following on from a dressing down from M is one of my favorite sequences in the movie - namely Shrublands. It's a favorite of mine because we really get introduced to my favorite character in the movie Fatima Blush, a character included in the aborted 1950s scripts. The 1965 movie has Fiona Volpe, but Volpe lacked the super-charged charisma, biting wit and ego-maniacal psychotic nature that Barbara Carrera simply oozes as Blush.<br />Look at the tenderness she shows to Jack, followed immediately by her bashing his head against the wall. Witness her dispatching of Jack and then crooning over her pet snake, and who can forget her final confrontation with 007 - \\"guess where you get the first one.\\"<br />Carrera steals every scene she is in. She dances on her way to kill Bonds French ally and like a black widow spider she seduces 007 and then attempts to kill him with a device to attract a special group of sharks attached to his air tanks.<br />The second highlight is the appearance of Indiana Jones alum Pat Roach as Count Lippe. Who cannot appreciate and revel in the fun fight in which Roach's Lippe plays the indestructible Jaws role, minus the embarrassing buffoonery that Richard Kiel brought to the EON franchise. Bond throws everything at Lippe to no avail and then in an amusing conclusion the character is blinded by Bond's urine falling back into a collection of glass cylinders and test tubes.<br />Connery's reaction is classic.<br />In an attempt perhaps to counter the familiarity of the group of has-been actors inhabiting the SIS offices in the EON series at the time, this Connery movie has the most impressive list of actors to inhabit any Bond movie. In addition to the already mentioned Connery, Fox, Carrera and Roach we also have the incredible Klaus Maria Brandeur as Largo, the revered Max Von Sydow and Bernie Casey as a black Felix Leiter (hey, why not?!).<br />Brandeur plays Largo with just the right amount of understated menace and Casey is probably the second best Leiter of the series (after Hedison). You really get the feeling that he and Connery's 007 are the best of buddies, their interactions and playful barbs appear genuinely affectionate and respectful of the other,<br />The one A-list actor who really lets down the rest of the team is Kim Basinger. She admittedly didn't have much to go on, but it is in this one respect that Claudine Auger and the 1965 EON effort takes the honors.<br />Some have said that it is with Bonds arrival in Nassau, that this movie tends to wander a little. I respectfully disagree. It is here that the majority of Carrera's scenes appear and here that Connery has his first confrontation with Largo. I have yet to really understand the computer game the two play, but it works nicely in building up some real tension and suspense (name a Moore 007 -villain scene that achieved the same level of pent up pressure - I can't). The final line from Connery - \\" I wouldn't know, I've never lost\\" is also probably one of the best 007 comebacks in the entire series.<br />Yes, this section of the movie also features some of the best dialogue, the promise of which had been ably shown in the brilliant Q-scene earlier in the picture. The lines come thick and fast and are genuinely witty in comparison with some of the gags in the Moore series of pictures. In addition Rowan Atkinson nicely doesn't outstay his welcome as comic relief and his \\"don't know his mother\\" line always makes me smile. Other gags that work include the cigarette lighter gag at the casino and the \\"your place or mine\\" bomb at the hotel.<br />The ending in Africa is over a little too soon and the small battle in the underground caverns lacks the scope of some of the 007 pictures. But I think it works well in the context of the rest of the picture and is not the confusing, overlong mess that really mars the 1965 effort. Its cleaner and tighter, just the way I like it.<br />Yes, even though Roger Moore is my favorite 007 actor, \\"Never Say Never Again\\" is my favorite 007 picture.<br />Irvin Kershner, who directed the best of the Star Wars movies, again brings us a franchises crowning achievement with a steady directing hand, incredible witty dialogue, superb performances by an amazing cast and Sean Connery returning revitalized after a 12 year absence from the role that made him famous.<br />It's the one 007 movie that I have watched more than any other.<br />After the movie was obtained by MGM-UA (the company that produces the EON production) there was talk among fans as to the possibility of the gun barrel sequence being added to make it part of the \\"canon\\", and indeed one fan put together a version of the movie with a gunbarrel, EON-style opening credits and traditional Bondian music that met with much acclaim in fandom.<br />I for one do not think that this unique James Bond 007 movie should be tampered with in that manner and equally happy to see it emerge on Blu-ray. I heartily recommend this movie.d charisma, biting wit and ego-maniacal psychotic nature that Barbara Carrera simply oozes as Blush.

It's the one 007movie that I have watched more than any other.   After the movie was obtained by MGM-UA (the company that produces the EON production) there was talk among fans as to the possibility of the gun barrel sequence being added to make it part of the \\"canon\\", and indeed one fan put together a version of the movie with a gunbarrel, EON-style opening credits and traditional Bondian music that met with much acclaim in fandom.   I for one do not think that this unique James Bond 007 movie should be tampered with in that manner and equally happy to see it emerge on Blu-ray. I heartily recommend this movie.
B001KMB6X2|2.0|I should have known not to waste 4 bucks on a rental for a movie that it's own director smashes. I was still willing to give it a shot because I've always enjoyed Vin Diesel's movies, since strays, all the way to Chronicles of Riddick. But this film is so underpar that at the end you feel like you've been cheated on. I wont give away any spoilers, but if you are in the mood to watch a movie without a clearly driven purpose, then this is up your alley. Not only is the movie poorly directed, but I also think this is the worst presence I've ever seen from Diesel.<br /><br />Not even the lack luster action scenes can make up for a movie with no plot, poor dialogue, and over-the-top circumstances. The flim never picks up from dragging, many of the other actors are vague and have no substance, and worst of all the younger lady playing co-star is painfully annoying.<br /><br />If you are into Diesel as I am, take my advise and don't watch this movie and save your cash for his up coming fast and furious. I know he has always been into fantasy sci-fi movies, but I think Diesel shines the most in films that can relate closer to reality.

0545128285|5.0|The Tales of Beedle the Bard is a good book, and completely complementary with the last Harry Potter book.  I personally thought the stories would be a little longer before I bought the book.  The commentary from Dumbledore offers a different view on the perspectives of each story.  Definitely an addition a Harry Potter fan would want to add to their library!

0321544080|4.0|It is a coffee table book laced with instruction.  People will enjoy viewing the wonderful photographs in this book.    But don't buy this book for it's photography work alone.  Accompanying the many excellent photographs are helpful instruction and advice from an experienced professional photographer.  This may not be the best book for a beginning photographer but many photographers could benefit from the helpful advice in this book.      Mr. McNally shares many of his experiences and hard learned expertise.  I find most of his advice being on the lighting end of photographs but there were some other helpful tips.  Lighting being one of the most important pieces of photography it's only right to focus on this topic and I think many photographers will find this book insightful.  Also the quick tips Mr. McNally shares with you that he has learned through experience or from his colleagues over the years in the business are very helpful to aspiring professionals.
0553579908|5.0|Here we have yet another 900+ pages of intensely satisfying well-written fantasy.  As well, this 2nd in the 'A Song of Ice and Fire' series also carries forward the uncertainty of just which favorite character may become spoken of in the past tense in the very next chapter.<br /><br />Primarily, though, readers witness the growth of many fascinating characters.  Be it the unpredictable changes faced by the likes of Jon Snow, Arya Stark, Tyrion Lannister, or any of many fascinating secondary or even tertiary characters, every one of them will have your rapt attention.
0385340990|4.0|I wonder if may be a reason THE GUERNSEY LITERARY AND POTATO PEEL PIE SOCIETY has been on the best seller list since its release. When the book was first appeared, the book jacket summary looked like something that would appeal to a number of people I know so I purchased quite a few copies. At one point I decided to read it myself and discovered a charming and engaging story.<br /><br />The story takes place in England in the aftermath of World War II. Juliet Ashton, a young writer, is seeking a topic for a new novel and stumbles upon it by accident when she receives a letter from Dawsey Adams, a  farmer living on an a Channel island that had been occupied by the Nazis. He comes across Juliet's name in a used book he owns and starts corresponding with her. Dawsey tells her of how the people on the island formed a reading group as a way of gathering without interference from the Nazi occupiers. At first they had no intention of forming a literary society, but eventually a great love of reading developed on the island.  Gradually she learns via letter (the entire story is told in this format) what the islanders had to endure. She later receives letters from other islanders who tell their version of the story. We meet not only the islanders but also various people in Juliet's life so we get to know a good number of people, all through letters.<br /><br />The plot is predictable though there are a few surprises which keep us interested, but this is not a fault. A complicated plot told through letters would become distracting. However, it is the letter format that keeps us intrigued. We feel as if we're eavesdropping on private correspondence though we know we're allowed. The letters give us just enough information to tell the story but we also learn about something we may not know, namely the occupation of the Channel Islands by the Nazis during the war and the sufferings these people endured. It also gives a realistic perspective. Characters re neither heroic nor evil, only human.
B001CSS4V6|5.0|Peter is very lucky because he can fly about all day and make Captain Hook's life a misery. I bought the American version of this also because there is a scene cut out of the UK version. This is the scene where Hook and Peter are in the Black Castle. I read this on the Internet a few days ago and then bought the US version.<br /><br />Both films are excellent,UK and the US version.
031606792X|3.0|Breaking Dawn is the fourth book in The Twilight Saga (Twilight, New Moon, Eclipse). Like the other Twilight books this book is slow at times and enthralling other times. I can't say much about this book without revealing too much of the final plot. Overall the Twilight series was an entertaining and enjoyable read.
B001GKJ2F2|4.0|The story line was a little lacking. Good looking movie tho, the script was lacking and lots of action. Almost too much.
B001DHXT20|3.0|... some great action scenes (my favourites? the fight on the campus and above all, the transformation of Banner/Norton into Hulk in doctor Stern's laboratory... that last scene is really a great sci-fi moment).  I should add to this that the special effects are really awesome too. The acting? Not bad at all but i agree that Edward Norton is under-used... Tim Roth is really convincing in the role of the bad guy and William Hurt is credible as the general Ross... Liv Tyler isn't that bad as Betty Ross...<br /><br />The directing is classical and not very innovative but still entertaining and breath-taking. Melodrama is reduced to the minimum and the hulk is often really scary... Letterier was obviously focused on a 95% \\"in your face\\" action-oriented pack and the Incredible Hulk is just that.<br /><br />My notation? 3,5 stars...
B0012QE4Q2|2.0|If you have read the book this movie will be a huge disappointment, at least it was for me. I loved the book and held high hopes when the movie came out. It was the most awful movie adaption ever! Not only did they change the order of events they threw things in there that never even happened. Sure the movie was pretty, and the cast is great, but people who have read the book deserve better. I was ready to turn the movie off fourty minutes before the movie was due to end.
B001GWK2MC|3.0|My 2 boys (ages 4 and 1) loved this Castle Bouncer and they played with it a lot when it was too cold to go outside.  It lasted slightly less than a year when it started developing holes and leaks and I cannot keep it inflated any longer.  I am going to try patching it but I was hoping it would last longer than this.  You definitely need the electric pump to blow it up though. There are 5 sections that have to be inflated and you can't do it manually.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I am a huge fan of Dexter and can't wait for the third season DVD to come out!  I've enjoyed the whole series so far. Looking forward to the 4th season in the fall.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|\\"Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog\\" is a hilarious and adorable musical.  The musical numbers are superb!  Joss Whedon's crooked humor shows through. The DVD extras are great too (musical commentary!). Although the low budget of this production does show through on some parts(it was originally made for the web), it is easy to overlook them and enjoy the cheesy comedic goodness.  Highly recommended!
0545128285|1.0|I absoulutely loved the Harry Potter series.  That said, this was quite possibly the worst book I've ever read.  It was the epitome of putting out a sequel just to get some money off the coattails of the Harry Potter books.  J.K Rowling disgusted me with this book.  Don't waste your money or time.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|A marvelous mini-series that manages to adapt and update Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. Cultural references are crucial to keeping in truth with both stories and the refernces are plentiful (Colin Firth in BBC's version, cell phones, etc.). This an amusing and entertaining set and one wishes that more books (by Austen or other writers) would get similar treatment.
B001ED7C58|5.0|This CD is fabulous. I listen to it at work from beginning to end and I never get tired of it!!! All the songs bring back images of the movie and take you back to a different time and place....
0670033049|5.0|I bought this book as a gift.  The friend reading it has termed this to be the \\"FINEST WRITING I HAVE EVER READ\\" and \\" beautifully explained plot, as big as life characterizations\\".    This plot is woven around a biblical thread placed in a California setting and will disappoint NO one who reads it!
B001ILHY1I|3.0|This loose remake to the original Death Race is an over the top, big budget film that works to a certain extent. The film has a lot of good elements that work for a Paul Anderson movie; the cinematography, the action scenes, and even some of the story is plausible.<br /><br />So what is wrong with Death Race? Simple the plot is too simplified; its just cars blowing up, extreme gunfire, and stylized action sequences. The movie doesn't have the soul of the original death race. While the plot is somewhat clever and different...it just doesn't have the humor or the cheesiness of the original. Nevertheless it's still a solid popcorn action flick.<br /><br />MY PERSONAL RATING: 3 OUT OF 5

0596522347|5.0|Nancy Duarte has an impressive resume that includes having created keynote slideshows for the likes of the Mozilla (Firefox browser) founder and Al Gore's Inconvenient Truth.  She knows that presentations should be more about the presenter and less about the \\"slideument\\" that most of us are familiar with.  She goes through PowerPoint as a graphic tool to help convey ideas, not words, sentences, or phrases.  It is beautifully created and could as easily be a \\"coffee table\\" book as it is a tool in a professional presenter's library.  Combined with Gar Reynolds' Presentation Zen (which goes over more of the concepts and philosophy of \\"clean\\" presentations), this will help you work to escape the death by PowerPoint we all encounter in every large meeting!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Movies look and sound great. The packaging/artwork is similar to what they did with the complete star wars blu ray set. Though be careful when you pull out the book-like part, the discs are in open sleeves so you may drop the cds if you pull it out without leaning it a bit. The extras are great, and I really enjoyed them. Some of the older making of stuff is a bit more slow than I'd like, but very informative. The cover of the book part and the outside are embossed and look really really nice. I won't review the movies themselves as most people reading this, already own the dvds and are wondering if they should upgrade. The answer is yes. All the movies are fun, and even though Crystal Skull got a lot of heat, I think when people take a breather and just relax and watch it you will find it gets better and better each time you see it. Sure it's over the top but they all are. And well the russians aren't as fun to hate as the Nazis, but it's period specific and accurate. It puts indy in his right age bracket (to match the stars age) and it's overally pretty fun. I can't imagine anyone who has seen the movie and saw Harrison Ford unceremoniously taken out of a trunk of the car and then tossed onto the ground, where he picks up his hat, and in a bit of clever shadow play puts the hat on. Anyone who saw that and didn't get chills isn't a true Indy fan. I'd highly recommend this purchase. Though I am still unsure whether there will be a fifth movie or not, and how that will fit in with this set if it is made. But, oh well. I'll probably wear them out by then anyway. This is definitely worth the upgrade. and you'll love the extras (on a seperate disc)
B001CISHU4|4.0|This isn't the best Amon Amarth to date, but it certainly is quite impressive and definitely one of the best albums of 2008. Containing much more melody than their average album, bordering on power metal at times. Death metal purists should not fret though, because this album contains all the aggression we have come to love from Amon Amarth. This is an album all who call themselves metalhead should look into, because it is truly a modern day classic.
B001P5HI4A|5.0|I am so happy that after so many years this film is now available for purchase. The songs in this movie touched me in so many ways and made literally made me a permanent fan in Miss Streisand. I love her.. eventhough it puts me at the ultimate gay stereotype.. I don't care. I love her. I have every album on CD that she made and made available and every movie she has made and put on DVD.... I love her. I'm a true fan.
B0012E6R3W|3.0|Many people seem to think this album is a Godly return from Testament, which I disagree with, however, that's not to say this isn't a good album. The Formation of Damnation is definitely a good thrash album most definitely in the same vain as the other classic Testament albums. There is literally not much more you could ask for from the band, because they put it all out there on this album, creating some great riffs that received substantial airplay on satellite radio and underground Internet stations. This is well worth the price you'll have to pay for it, especially for classic thrash and Testament fans.
0439023483|4.0|I'm not quite sure what I thought the Hunger Games would be about when I picked it up (Amazon recommended it) so I was a tad disturbed with some of the Lottery-like imagery. Despite several loud comments from a friend (to whom I had described the plot a few pages in) that I should just \\"put the book down and walk away,\\" I perservered and finished the book. I'm really glad that I did.<br /><br />Katniss Everdeen has been providing for her family since her father died in a coal mine a few years ago in District 12 (Appalachia). Her mother is an apothecary but couldn't care for either Katniss or her younger daughter Primrose (Prim for short) right after her husband's death. All three would have starved if not for Katniss' hunting abilities.<br /><br />As if life wasn't cruel enough in this post-apocolyse world, every year one boy and one girl from each of the twelve districts must be sent to the Capitol (somewhere in the Rockies) to participate in the Hunger Games. The participants are chosen on a lottery system with every boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 putting at least one name into the pot. 12-year-olds must put in one slip, 13-year-olds two slips etc. Life is so poor in some parts of the district though that you can enter your name more than once to receive a yearly food stipend for your family. On Katniss' first entry into the reaping (the lottery) she entered herself four times: once for the requirement and then once for food for herself, for her mother, for her younger sister. Moreover the slips are cumulative so Katniss will enter at least 8 her second year and increasing her odds of being chosen to particpate in the Hunger Games.<br /><br />The Hunger Games are held each year to remind the Districts of their loss and the participants are rightfully called 'Tributes.' Once all 24 names have been chosen the Tributes are taken to the Capitol to prepare for the televised games (which are mandatory for the districts to watch). Only one Tribute can survive the Hunger Games and the reward for winning is a life of luxury and fame. No one from District 12 has won one of the Hunger Games in 30 or so years and the last winner spends all of his time drunk.<br /><br />The odds are against Katniss the year that her beloved younger sister Prim is forced to enter her name into the reaping. She has 20 or so slips in the pot with her name on it and made sure her sister would only be putting in her obligatory one entry. Despite the odds, Prim's name is chosen and Katniss, knowing her younger sister would definitely not survive the Games, volunteers to go in her place.<br /><br />I did see many plot points coming (the banding together in the arena for one) but others were unexpected (her coming to truly care for her comrade Peeta) and it was a violent and bumpy ride. The effect at the end though was cheering as Katniss stands against the system. I look forward to the next book in the Trilogy and hope it clears up some of the lingering questions I had since the book ended so abruptly.e reward for winning is a life of luxury and fame.

B0012GMWCA|3.0|This has a few overlooked gems mixed with a little filler, but falls short because it lacks the personality of E-Street. I'm a big fan of his other solo (acoustic) work.  But on an album with a full band, it's just a little bland to hear Bruce and not be able to picture Max, Clarence, and others by his side.  In addition, the production is too slick for Springsteen's earthy voice and lyrics.  The Big Muddy is a prime example of a song that could have used a more organic approach.  \\"Lucky Town\\" is a must for fans, but others should start with \\"Born to Run\\", \\"Born in the USA,\\" or even \\"The Rising.\\"<br /><br />With that said, the 4.99 price is definitely worth it, and you can load these on your iPod:<br />1.

I primarily play shooters but I thought it looked like a better option than a keyboard and it looked like it would be a lot more comfortable.<br /><br />So I got it and of course the fps games I play don't have one of the default profiles that Logitech provides. Fallout 3 did have one but nothing else. So it took a while to set it up to play my current addiction game (L4D). You can literally make each key on it whatever key you want but it takes some setup. L4D doesn't really use a lot of keys so setting up the basics is fine then it took a bit of trial and error to figure out the best way to set the other keys.<br /><br />The first real issue I had was that the space bar by default is totally out of place. So I set one of the buttons by the d-pad as space, still wasn't that wonderful. The last thing you want is to have to pause and think of where a key is and I was thinking that would be a real problem. Well then I tried setting up the d-pad so it was the space in a certain movement, crouch it another, it works really well.<br /><br />But it does take a while to get used to, I was so used to the keyboard that I had all sorts of issues, especially losing track of the keys. But after 2 weeks its starting to feel very natural and Ive really started to enjoy using it a lot more than I thought I would at first.  Ive pretty much just used it for l4d and farcry2 so far but I think I will try to use it for Photoshop and Dreamweaver soon.<br /><br />The software is great, it uses the same program as the G series keyboards which I had so it didn't take a lot to get used to. You can store profiles on the device and take them with you to other computers but that other computer also has to have the software installed on it. They advertise the take it with you profiles but I don't think they made it too clear about the software.<br /><br />So the real question is can I recommend this to someone who doesn't play MMOs and is more into FPS? Well, honestly it isn't going to be some game altering addition at first but the more you get used to it, customize it, get used to it (that's a biggie)  its a pretty good thing to have. Its very portable compared to a keyboard and honestly its a lot more comfortable than a regular keyboard for long hours of gaming. I like it for myself but its hard to recommend to someone who is happy with the regular keyboard because I really think it comes down to individual taste whether it works for you or not. And it isn't cheap so I just cant say this is the best thing to spend $ on to improve your gaming but I like it and will keep on using it so that's good enough for me!esn't play MMOs and is more into FPS?

B0015OKWL2|1.0|This movie is such a tragic waste.  Like \\"On The Waterfront\\"'s Terry Malloy, it coulda been a contender -- if it had a different script, a different director, and a different supporting cast.  (Seriously -- 50 Cent and Donnie Wahlberg?  What, was Rob Schneider busy?)  As it is, the plot is stale and utterly predictable and completely dull to watch.  It's not even right to call the ending a \\"twist\\" because if you were watching with at least one eye open, you saw it coming pretty much from the beginning.  Pacino and DeNiro don't do anything with their performances that lift them out of the molds they've made for themselves these last  ten years -- the craggy, foul-mouthed cop and/or crook.  DeNiro has gotten some traction out of sending up that image in movies like \\"Analyze This\\" and \\"Meet The Parents\\" but this time around, he expects us to take him seriously.  Not happening.  There's really not much more I can say about this movie, to be honest.  The bottom line is that it should have generated some Heat (pun very much intended) but instead it left me cold.  It's boring as heck, and the presence of these two heavyweights doesn't make it any more interesting.  It's even worse than \\"The Score\\" -- another epic combination of actors (DeNiro, Brando and Norton) in a movie that's unworthy of their talent.<br /><br />The extras are a waste of time.  There's a trailer, but it wasn't that great a trailer so I had no desire to watch it again.  I saw this movie because of the DeNiro/Pacino pairing, not because of the trailer.  There's a short feature on the movie itself with all the actors gushing about being able to work with the two legends.  That feature only makes me wonder why there isn't a feature where the two legends sit down and talk to each other about working together and about their careers.  Spike Lee and Denzel Washington did it in the extras for \\"Inside Man,\\" and I would have loved to see something similar here, but no dice.  Instead we get a long, useless feature with real NYPD cops talking about their jobs and how their jobs compare to the movie.  It's the kind of thing I'd expect to see on The Discovery Channel, but would never actually watch, and I didn't finish watching it on this DVD either.  Not a single actor from the movie is in it.<br /><br />Even the most die-hard Pacino and DeNiro fans -- the nutters who'll never admit to any flaws in their icons, and sweep all their recent terrible film choices under the rug (\\"88 Minutes\\", anyone?) in favor of harping on the increasingly distant past -- are sure to be disappointed by this one.  It's just a crying shame that these guys couldn't have spent the last 14 years finding another project that suited their talent, and really challenged them to step up to the plate again as great actors, instead of just phoning it in.  This entire DVD is just a monument to a colossal missed opportunity.eal NYPD cops talking about their jobs and how their jobs compare to the movie.

B001LRJH0U|2.0|I like westerns, and wish the studios made more. But not like this one. I hope this western format is never copied even on TV. This movie drags, much too long and ruins opportunities for meaningful action scenes. I wasted 20 bucks. By the way, badly writtened.

0060574216|4.0|This is a great fundamental guide to communication. In Mars & Venus, Gray uses the analogy of men and women originating from different planets,therefore speaking different languages, with different traditions and nonverbals. He then proceeds to translate the languages and characteristics as one might if you were travelling to a new and unfamiliar country. He provides ample examples of each of his points.      My partner and I enjoyed many laughs after reading this book as we compared ourselves to the typical Martian or Venutian. The insights were spot on. I would recommend this book to anyone considering living or working with the opposite sex.
B001CDZZI6|1.0|The classic bait and switch tactic.  Sell the book and the test and give a partial evaluation.  Don't do it unless you are prepared to spend about $600.00 for the book and the full evaluation.
0812979656|1.0|I read this book based on all the positive, glowing reviews it rec'd. Well I should have paid more attention to the one-star reviews because I completely agree with most of them. This book was so cumbersome. I insisted on finishing it, hoping it would pick up or that something incredible might happen. Well nothing happened. I almost feel like maybe I missed something in there among all her fancy talk and poetic-like writing. I just didn't \\"get\\" it. Maybe it was over my head, I don't know. I feel like the author really was all over the place as far as characters and times are concerned. I couldn't tell what was present day and what was the past. I thought about rereading it because I may better understand it a second time but decided that I better not waste any more time on this novel. The Amazon review says that Roy's writing is very dreamlike and sensual. I do agree with this to an extent but it was not intelligible. I like dreamlike writing, but more along the lines of Haruki Murakami. Overall, I felt this was a pretty big waste of my reading time.

B001ILFUD2|4.0|This is one of the first Disney movies I remember watching in the theater as a young child.  I loved it so much back then and remember having to get all of the McDonalds happy meal toys they had including the musical ornaments.  Unfortunately I dont think they had alot of merchandise for this film as they do with most other Disney films and that makes this movie almost forgotten until now!<br /><br />Oliver and Company 20th Anniversary Editon DVD released on Feb. 3rd, 2009.  A little over 20 years from its holiday 1988 theatrical release.  Has it really been that long?  I bought the DVD the day it came out at my local Disney Store.  I also was surprised to see that the Disney Store at my mall was selling Oliver and Company Plushes and they were discounted when you bought the movie.  Since I have seen virtually no merchandise for this film since 1988, I had to grab one so I let my son pick one.  He picked Dodger and we went home to watch the film.<br /><br />First of all let me tell you my first impressions.  The shiny cover that boasts the 20th anniversary edition on the front is nice and fits in nicely with all my other \\"Special Edition, Platinum edition\\" Disney animated films that I own.  Now first impressions are always good, but how does the DVD hold up?<br /><br />Well, let me say this.  If you already own the original release on DVD, you might want to think about this before you upgrade.  The bomus features are exactly the same except for one new game that was only included in this release.  The cartoon shorts are the same, the sing along songs are the same, the doocumentary is the same.  Everything is exactly the same.  However I have never seen the original DVD so I cannot compare transfers.  But lets talk about that.<br /><br />The transfer is AMAZING.  Not sure if it is just as good on the first DVD release or not since I have never seen that one, but let me tell you that the film looks great and even better than it did in theaters 20 years ago!  Vibrant colors, great sound brings 1980's New York City to life.  I am very very impressed.  Not that I was expecting any less from Disney however.<br /><br />Special Features:<br /><br />* All new Oliver's big city challenge game. (A fairly easy DVD game that is actually fun for kids.  It is more puzzle oriented than trivia oriented.  Not on original release)<br /><br />The Following Was Already Included In The Original DVD Release:<br /><br />* The making of Oliver and Co.  (A 5 min documentry from 1988 that talks about the making of and the computer technology used in the film.)<br /><br />*  Shorts - \\"Lend a Paw\\" starring Pluto, and \\"Puss Cafe\\" also starring Pluto.<br /><br />*  Theatrical Trailer, TV Spots, Production Gallery<br /><br />Technical Specs:<br /><br />Dolby Digital 5.1 SS<br />Spanish and French Language Tracks<br />Widescreen (1.66:1) enhanced for 16x9 televisions.<br />Digitally Mastered<br /><br />So is it worth the upgrade?  If the transfers are the same or pretty close, I would say no.  If this release is sinificantly better, then yes.  If you don't own this film, this is definately the version to get.  I give this release 4 out of 5 stars.  The Film gets 5 stars the release gets 3 since they could have added more special features.  That averages out to 4 out of 5 stars.  So if you don't own this underrated classic, now is your chance!  This will probably be the definitive version since Disney doesn't promote this film a whole lot.  They didn't even do much promoting for this release!!!  We could have/should have had more, but for what it is.... its still great!New York City to life.  I am very very impressed.

0316113506|5.0|This book has confirmed a lot of intuitive judgment I have had over my career as a pharmacist, dispensing a variety of anti-depressants and mood stabilizer medications.  Dr. Ratey clearly shows how people who have incorporated a regular exercise program into their life have little need for such medications - their brain and body is producing all the right substances in all the right proportions, naturally.  This book should be required for all professional educators, all phys. ed. teachers and 100% of everyone involved in student athletics, all principals and school administrators, and all parents.  That's not hype - this book will become the benchmark that changes how America looks at education & exercise, and how important it is for optimal brain functioning.  If you suffer from depression, anxiety, addictive disorders, ADHD, this book can be your pathway for getting healthy and quite possibly off of medications all together.  I ordered another copy to give to my son's school teachers.
B000002KAT|5.0|In November of 1968 a twenty two year old Van Morrison walked into a New York City recording studio with eight new songs in hand. His idea was to record an acoustic album of jazz infused blues material, something along the lines of John Mayall's \\"Turning Point\\" album, recorded live at The Fillmore Auditorium. The arrangements were primerily written for guitar, Bass, piano/harpsichord/vibes, violin, cello and flute with sparse percussion. Later horns were added to \\"The Way Young Lovers Do\\". The results were astonishing. Truely Van had captured something that was never heard before and still remains unique, relevant and beyond description. Rolling Stone ranked it number nineteen on their all-time greatest five hundred album list. Not bad for an album that orginialy didn't place in Bill Board's top-40 album chart. Personnaly I think it belongs in anyone's top ten list. While Astral Weeks is not a thematic work, it does manage to capture a consistant feeling throughout. Perhaps it's longing or unrequited love or simply alienation. Whatever the emotion, Van's phrasing and soulful wail are ever present throughout and completely captivate the listner.      I remember playing Astral Weeks for my friend Artie in the summer of 1969. Artie was actually my uncle's friend. He was in his mid fifties, while I was just nineteen. Artie was a bar tender at Small's Paradise, a famous New York City watering hole where he had rubbed elbows with the likes of Miles Davis, Stan Getz, Richard Pryor, King Curtis and so many other jazz and show biz personalities. When I told him that this album, recorded by a twenty two year old singer/songwriter from Belfast would knock him out, Artie gave me that \\"I've seen it all\\" look, as could only come from a hard boiled, dyed in the wool cynic. Well neither of us spoke a word throughout the entire record. When it was over he turned to me and said \\"Dammm!!! That's the most incredible thing I've ever heard. Who is this guy?\\"    Well this guy is Van \\"TheMan\\" Morrison, The \\"Belfast Cowboy\\". And he's still going strong. As a matter of fact, Van is touring right now, doing a complete show of Astral Weeks material. I'm planning on seeing him at The WaMu Theatre in NYC later this month. So Van, weather you're up on Cyprus Avenue or on New York City's Seventh Avenue, you've still got it in my book. I can't wait...I only wish that Artie were still around to catch, what I'm sure will be a fantastic evening of great music. Thanks Van, for having the courage to follow your instincts. You couldn't have made a more perfect record as far as I'm concerned. What's more, I'm sure Artie would agree.

0765350386|4.0|A unique fantasy is something that when you find it, you know that you are onto something great, or entirely the other way. Well, happily Sanderson has done something great. What makes this unique is not that the heroes have to overcome the evil ruler, because you know you've heard that before.<br /><br />Or that the evil ruler has monstrous minions, because we have seen that before also. But that those evil minions are such that no one can remember ever defeating the minions, or the evil ruler who is immortal as far as everyone knows. Yet that too has been read elsewhere.<br /><br />What separates The Final Empire is magic. Not everyone has the ability, but those that do access their magic in such a well described and unique way that the entirety of the magical world makes sense and is needful to its resolution. Complexity and depth make this work breakout from the others in the genre.<br /><br />The plot moves at a decent pace though the buildup to the crescendo of the climax has some lulls. Once that climax triggers though, a great deal happens both expected and unexpected making the book a very worthwhile read.
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|I really appreciated your fast service and the condition of the DVD.  It was great!
B00006L83N|5.0|This is a fantastic progressive metal album.  Like the band's previous CD, \\"V: The New Mythology Suite\\", the songs in this album are inspired by a combination of fantasy, history, and literature.  It consists of 8 short songs (counting the bonus track on the limited edition) and one extended 24 minute mini rock opera based on Homer's \\"The Odyssey\\".  All the music is outstanding with powerful metalic riffs and emotionally varied vocals by singer Russell Allen.    While I found the story and lyrics of the rock opera \\"V\\" trite and rambling, I like the band's story telling on this album much more.  While there is nothing original here, the stories and scenes of the short songs work well in their settings; they kind of remind me of the lyrics of Ronnie James Dio both in Rainbow and his own band Dio.  The story of the title track is much more coherent than the story in \\"V\\".  I also think the overall composition of the title track is tighter and more skilled.  It is an outstanding track and definitely my favorite on the album.  But the rest of the album is also very enjoyable with plenty of variety.

I'm thinking about returning it i was hoping to light up my desk well its doesn't hopefully this will help someone before the go out and buy it
B00005JOA0|3.0|The best thing about this version of Tenant is that it mercifully cuts out a lot of Anne Bronte's prose -- the original story concept is brilliant, but on re-reading the book (after seeing the DVD) I was reminded of how second-rate much of the writing is, and how poor the secondary plots are (though I am a worshipper of Anne Bronte regardless).  What the DVD misses is the bleakness and the loneliness and mysteriousness of Helen's situation on her own -- a single woman on her own was desperately threatening in those days -- everything in this film is busy all the time.  One longs for just a minute or two of stillness -- but you can't do that on TV these days.  The chattering and swooping just cuts into the moodiness that the book, with all its overdoneness, still evokes.   The part of Gilbert is hell to do, and I found Stephens boring, but Gilbert is pretty boring all round.  Rupert Graves was excellent:  you could just see how impossible it was to leave him, and how prissy Helen could be.  Another thing you can't do much of these days is religion, but her struggle with Huntington over his soul was, for Anne, probably the most important part of the book -- and needed to be emphasized more. My only strong reservation about Tara Fitzgerald was her pulledback hairdo.  I appreciate the symbolism, but it is really too unflattering to look at for two hours.

This movie is my third Akira Kurosawa film : he is a classic director. We find that the (matchlock) muskets that are probably Dutch in origin are important in 1575 in Japan.<br />The theme is about a double who is like a \\"ghost\\" or shadow warrior, taking the place of a dead great warlord for three years.<br />For his blood and guts style that one expects, this movie is very \\"clean\\"<br />and as a result maybe slower and less of the realism that one might have expected from this director?

When Carl the monkey was introduced I thought he would annoy me, but I ended up thinking it was cute. I disliked Lula Farting and belching, and the Firefarter character.

These books will not change your life or anything like that, but they are so interesting on several levels. 1. You learn something about sociology and economics painlessly, these are an easy read. 2. He tells a lot of cool stories to illustrate his points - so the information does tend to stay with you. 3. The ideas he shares are actually rather useful in understanding our culture. 4. The information is just so interesting! Highly recommended.

B00006I53S|2.0|This lens looks on the surface to be a great all-purpose lens, and at first the pictures looked a step up from my [[ASIN:B000V1VG2E Canon PowerShot A720IS 8MP Digital Camera with 6x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom]].  It has image stabilization, and a good range, I thought it would be a good general purpose lens.  I quickly became disillusioned with the results, many pictures where out of focus, so I thought I would compare it against my other lenses.  What I discovered surprised me.  I took the cost effective 50mm lens, the 100mm macro lens, the 70-300mm IS lens, the kit 18-55mm and the 28-135mm and took the same pictures at focal lengths of 50mm and 100mm of a batik (where possible).  I made sure I had adequate lighting to avoid camera shake (1300 watts total, plus all pictures were above 1/50th second), which I thought might be the culprit, and took a series of photos with each lens at f4.5.  The worst lenses by far were the 28-135 and the 18-55 which gave about the same results.  Whilst the 100mm macro lens (from the same distance) and the 70-300mm IS, and often the 50mm showed the grain of the canvas on which the art was imprinted, the 28-135mm and the 18-55 were not sharp at all, and sometimes downright blurry.  This was at a distance of about 2 meters (12 feet).  There were 5 test pictures, in every single one, the 100mm macro lens gave the best result (just ahead of the surprisingly good 70-300IS).  The 28-135 was very disappointing.  I think the sample was wide enough to eliminate operator error.  I wondered if my camera was failing to auto-focus properly, but the results with the 100mm are perfect 9 times out of 10, often even when working at macro ranges with autofocus on, and bad 10/10 with the 28-135mm.  In short: Avoid this lens if you want crisp pictures. Get instead the [[ASIN:B00005K47X Canon - Lens - 50 mm - f/1.8 II - Canon EF]] (though some say the f1.4 is better, I might agree, but it's over 4 times the price, and this is definitely a step up fromthe 28-135), and also the [[ASIN:B00004XOM3 Canon EF 100mm f/2.8 Macro USM Lens for Canon SLR Cameras]].  It won't set you back that much more, and you'll get much better pictures and be able to do macro work!  You might argue that the 28mm end would be missing, but the kit lens takes as good photos as this lens, so you're not missing much except perhaps better manual focus, but I would imagine few are using manual focus with this lens.  Other problems you may find are that the zoom barrel will extend of it's own accord if you point the camera downward.  I also found that I had to take two or three pictures at a time to get one that was anywhere near in focus and correctly exposed.  Lens certainly won't just 'snap' the moment first time, I dread to think what it would be like on action shots.

B001JQVKBW|4.0|When I first heard that Seal was doing an album of soul standards, I was a bit leary because many artists have tried to accomplish this feat without adding anything 'New' or they ried too hard to give their interpretation to songs that simply do not need to be touched. I was glad as a matter of fact elated to see that this great artist has proved me wrong. At this time in his career, Seal could have made no greater move than to record this album of Standards. There have been many albums recorded of standards but rarely have they been SOUL standards and even fewer have accomplished the level that Seal has raised the bar to. From the strings that are first heard to the soulfullness and melodic harmony of \\"It's A Man's World\\" to the illustrious instrumentation of \\"If You Don't Know Me By Now\\". This album simply accomplishes what it set out to do. It wins on every level. If you are a lover of true soul music and you do not have this CD in your collectiion, you are doing yourself a great injustice!

1416562605|5.0|The title of this book is a reference to the protagonist of the book, Balram Halwai.  As a young boy, Balram is told by a relative that he is a white tiger (the rarest creature in the jungle), an image that Balram incorporates with maximum seriousness.  Emerging from the Darkness (author Adiga's term for rural India) Balram is immersed in the jungle of urban India.  An imminent visit from the premier of China (coming to investigate the spirit of the entrepreneur in India) provides the opportunity for Balram to write his own story in a series of letters to the Chinese visitor.<br /><br />In the competitive world of publishing, The White Tiger may, itself, be one of the rarest creatures in the jungle.  Brief, sharp-witted, intensely focused, it is a spice-laden Indian literary meal loaded with all the color but much more punch and bite than a Bollywood movie. The over-arching theme is that of the rooster cage:  citizens of rural India are doomed to live in a rooster cage imposed by milleniums of culture overlayed by a very thin veneer of modern innovation (e.g. democracy and the attempt to eliminate caste).  Through Balram, Adiga proposes that even if the rooster cage were to open, most Indians would not leave its security.  Adiga's assertion, incidentally, is well supported by sociological and anthropological research:  we humans like, on some level, our cages.<br /><br />Balram Halwai is a cage-o-clast (a smasher of cages).  His cage smashing technique is, depending on your point of view, courageous, sociopathic, blood-thirsty, a blow for freedom, traitorous.  And...funny, shocking, blunt, honest, philosophical.  When Balram strikes his gory blow for personal freedom and leaves a shattered cage behind, was it analagous to the American Colonialists firing upon the British during the American Revolution, or was it an act of psychopathy? Or are the two events more interwined than we would like to admit?<br /><br />The White Tiger is a rarity in that the language is nimble and entertaining, but the thematic content runs deep.  Said differently: highly entertaining, constantly thought-provoking.<br /><br />If you're an aficionado of India, read it.  If your book group loves a good scrap, choose it.  If you have a yen for diving deeply into cultures with more spice (curry?) than your own, seize it.  Locked into a Judeo-Christian morality?  Let this one pass you by: Adiga's literary banquet will give you gastrointestinal distress, if not downright cause you to choke.g, but the thematic content runs deep.

B001KL3GY0|4.0|As much as I loved \\"Take Me Out\\" when it first reared it's head in 2004, I hated Franz Ferdinand because they'd become the most over-hyped indie-band ever.  Everywhere you turned around, Franz Ferdinand appeared.  I knew they were a solid, sound band, but I was like \\"are they really worthy of all this hype?\\" The answer to that question was of course, no, at least in my eyes, but I always thought the band was good, if not great.  Their self-titled debut of course went platinum here in the States, making you think 'oh they're not so indie, now are they'. However, their second album, the underrated YOU COULD HAVE IT SO MUCH BETTER flopped, selling under 400,000 in the states.  A four year hiatus brings us to TONIGHT, which doesn't necessarily trump their debut, but does reinstate some of the glory of their debut.  It is doubtful that Franz will ever have another \\"Take Me Out\\" (they were semi-close with \\"Do You Want To\\"), but tracks like \\"Ulysses\\" and \\"No You Girls\\" are pretty good if I may say so myself.  Gnarls Barkley didn't return with another \\"Crazy\\" after all, now did they?<br /><br />The album starts with the brilliant \\"Ulysses\\", which in my eyes is one of Franz's best and most fun tracks.  Maybe it's not \\"Take Me Out\\", but it comes pretty close.  The synthesizer sounds and guitar effects add to the greatness that is \\"Ulysses\\", a certified indie-rock gem. \\"Turn It On\\" keeps the momentum going, causing TONIGHT not to miss a single beat.  With Franz's signature thick bass lines, \\"Turn It On\\" reminds us that despite the over-hype given to Franz Ferdinand in 2004, they really are one of today's greatest rock bands. Not even 4 years could deteriorate that reputation.<br /><br />\\"No You Girls\\" keeps driving TONIGHT with another genuine hit. The guitars are in the pocket and the organization epitomized in the production is phenomenal.  \\"No You Girls\\" with it's incredibly catchy, tuneful refrain is definitely one of my favorites from TONIGHT (second only to say \\"Ulysses\\"). Alex Kapranos is on his 'A' game.<br /><br />\\"Send Him Away\\" lays well, as does the majority on this album. Maybe a shade less catchy than \\"Ulysses\\", \\"Turn It On\\", or \\"No You Girls\\", \\"Send Him Away\\" is still indie-rock epitomized at its best.  Perhaps the best part of \\"Send Him Away\\" is the stylistic change that happens a little more than a minute from the ending, in which you see Franz Ferdinand extend their style and take risks. This risk does not miss.<br /><br />\\"Twilight Omens\\" continues Franz Ferdinand's experiments with synthesized sounds combined with dirty, crisp 60s sounding guitars. It is another solid number, if not as solid as \\"Ulysses\\" or \\"No You Girls\\". However, let me say even if this track is a shade less desirable than the \\"cream of the crop\\", contextually speaking, this track is still way above par.<br /><br />\\"Bite Hard\\" finds the Scottish boys slowing down the tempo, well at least at first that is.  After lovely balladry by Kapranos upon the onset of \\"Bite Hard\\", the boys go into full-fledged dance-rock in which Kapranos shouts enthused \\"bite hard!\\". Again, no complaints as this track lays as well as everything else on TONIGHT.<br /><br />\\"What She Came For\\" begins with one of the albums sickest grooves as of yet.  Honestly, this groove would fit perfectly on any retro-soul/neo-soul album - urban producers would kill for this groove, honestly. As catchy as the lyrics are, the production is equally as catchy with wacky effects and a phenomenal timbre.  A great track in my eyes; it embodies the classic rock sound that was the 1960s.<br /><br />\\"Live Alone\\" is as close as you can get to techno without ruining the indie-rock ambiance.  It is solid, but not necessarily a favorite for me.  The sounds are great, the vocals first-rate, and even the concept is worthwhile; it just doesn't overtake \\"Ulysses\\", that's all.<br /><br />\\"Can't Stop Feeling\\" continues an exploration of pop-sounds incorporated with indie-rock. Again, the effect is an interesting, successful one. To compare Franz Ferdinand and say The Killers maybe a bit off, but both of these bands are searching to make rock music that is danceable again, like it used to be.  If you think back to The Rolling Stones with a great hit like \\"Miss You\\" not only did it rock hard, it also was very danceable.  I believe that is the effect that with a track like \\"Can't Stop Feeling\\" or the Killers' \\"Mr. Brightside\\" that is the sort of effect being sought.<br /><br />\\"Lucid\\", at 7:56, is the lengthiest listen of TONIGHT, but is worthwhile, as is everything on TONIGHT. \\"Lucid\\" turns out to be one of the stronger listens actually, making it a key track.  On this track, Franz Ferdinand pools all their knowledge of pop sensibilities and catchy hooks to make one killer song. And ladies and gentleman, what about all of those sick-synths? Have Franz Ferdinand been working with hip-hop producers or something? Kudos, maybe all the 2004 was truly deserved Franz Ferdinand.<br /><br />\\"Dream Again\\" find Franz Ferdinand reserving the tempo slightly, but not without all the extravagance of synthesizers and maybe drum programming as well? Here, I hear an influence of Simon and Garfunkle because of the lazy, restrained quality of the vocals here. Batting 1000 boys, batting 1000.<br /><br />The album closes with \\"Katherine Kiss Me\\", which begins with only acoustic guitars (can you believe it?).  Sincere as any singer-songwriter song, \\"Katherine\\" proves to be an interesting ending to a very interesting album.  I do question why the boys would end this overall uptempo album with a singer-songwriter styled number? Maybe \\"Katherine\\" would've been better served as the penultimate track. Ultimately, it isn't a big deal though, as Franz Ferdinand return full-fledged with this great third effort. 4 stars, Franz.The Killers maybe a bit off, but both of these bands are searching to make rock music that is danceable again, like it used to be.

B001DJLCRC|5.0|Hi all, I'll try and be brief with my review of this show, here goes (and no worries, NO SPOILERS!)  Breaking Bad is an Intense drama with some comedic moments to relax the gritty plot.  Bryan Cranston plays a high school chemistry teacher who is diagnosed with inoperable cancer, but because he has nothing to leave his pregnant wife and handicapped son, he decides to begin cooking crystal meth.  This leads to all sorts of mind-blowing events that definitely cross the lines of morality in hopes of an ultimately greater good.  I can't really say much more without giving certain details about the show away.  But trust me when I say WATCH THIS SHOW!!  It is an incredible new series that justifies the not so innocent actions of our hero \\"Walter White\\" who is ultimately trying to make use of his expiring heart of gold to help his family by taking actions no one would even imagine.      Season 2 premieres March 8th on AMC.  In recent years many shows with great potential have come and gone quickly without lasting full seasons.  It would be a tragedy to lose this show, above any other.
020161622X|3.0|Well, after reading most of the glowing reviews here, I was pretty interested in the book. I thumbed through it at a bookstore, and ended up buying on Amazon (kudos for the lower price). I read the book, and became confused. I made sure the reviews matched the book title. I read the book again. Quite frankly, I don't see what makes this book so great- not that it is bad and/or a waste of money (though it is on the pricey side given how little you get- big font and big line spacing, like a 7th-grade term paper)- it just isn't the greatest thing since sliced bread.<br /><br />The authors have compiled a list of several tips to keep in mind while programming. Ultimately, I think this is their answer to Fred Brooks' searching for a silver bullet in [[ASIN:0201835959 The Mythical Man-Month]], based on their years of experience in the field. It ends up being a lot of \\"eating your own dog food,\\" in my humble opinion. Just because they met with success using a certain method/tool (usually on financial software) doesn't mean you will. Not all programming practices transcend all boundaries and are generally applicable to all programming problems. Some people are faster and more capable (and more comfortable) with an IDE than with a plain text editor; get off your high horse. I don't agree with most of the tips. Some, however, are absolutely necessary, such as version control. Every tip is tied to an analogy or some story outside of programming- which may be nice to some, but I see it as an insult to a reader's intelligence. Every single tip? Really? Not necessary....really.<br /><br />The majority of the book is language-independent, which is nice. There are a few humorous moments spread throughout the book, and it is overall a very easy read- not at all like reading a technical work, despite the content. I think the book is definitely worth a read...the tips are all rooted in common sense (or pragmatism, if you will). The advice is sage-like, which to me means listen up and listen closely, but take it with a grain of salt and adapt the morals of the story to your own coding practices.but take it with a grain of salt and adapt the morals of the story to your own coding practices.

6304044836|5.0|Now, I've always loved Audrey Hepburn, one of the most charming actresses ever to shine from the silver screen. However, I have to admit, I find her portrayal of Sabrina horribly dated and stuck in the sexist mire of the 1950s . . . not her fault, of course; but she is so much the child-woman that she comes off childish sometimes, not childlike. So I can't understand the absolute reverence for the original film. Seems like film-school mantra to me (the original Golden Age version will always be revered more than any remake). I also love the way that Julia Ormand's truly \\"grown-up\\" Sabrina affects Linus NOT by being impish and acting like an overgrown five-year-old, but by seeing through his hardened veneer, which is in fact the way that people truly fall in love. Men don't fall for naive, impish children, no matter how gamine (only in a sexist 1950s world would people buy into that myth); they've always fallen for real women who see their true, inner nature, who upset their world by pricking through their pretenses with razor-sharp perception. And Ormand-Ford carry this falling-in-love dance off perfectly.    As I said, I love Hepburn . . . in other roles (her Eliza Doolittle is a far better acting job on her part, absolutely memorable). In this earlier film in her career, 1950s stereotype trumped reality, at least in my opinion. I far prefer this newer version.
B001P5HI4A|1.0|For what is arguably the best musical made in the last 25 years, it's a crime this was brought out like this and not released simultaneously on blu-ray.<br /><br />As most of us know, the real power of blu-ray is the soundtrack, and this is one that definitely deserves uncompressed sound.  Quite honestly, I have NO idea what they were thinking about in releasing this now (two years ago, before BD won the war, this might have been welcomed).<br /><br />As it is I would recommend that most folks stay well away from this in the hopes it will encourage La Belle Streisand to make this the first BD release of her many wonderful films.  We've waited this long, might as well wait until it's done right.
B001DXS4E2|3.0|Even though this black-and-white 1942 musical is viewed favorably by film historians when compared to its partial full-color 1954 remake, [[ASIN:B000TGJ8BW White Christmas]], I think the original feels more dated and marginally less engaging perhaps because the pairing of Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire does not generate as much fun as one would hope. Given that each is a legend in his own right and they are bound to another legend, Irving Berlin, the result is too lightweight for its own good despite the prominent showcase given to the composer's songbook, most famously \\"White Christmas\\", which was first introduced in this film. It is also likely the only film to inspire an international hotel chain.<br /><br />Crosby and Astaire play entertainers Jim Hardy and Ted Hanover, partnered professionally but finding themselves in a romantic predicament when Ted steals away Jim's fianc&eacute;, Lila. Jim takes the rejection in stride and decides to quit the act to start a [[ASIN:B0000V4906 Green Acres]]-like existence on a Connecticut farm. However, since show business is still in his blood. Jim decides to convert the farmhouse into an inn and nightclub but keeps his operation open only during the holidays. That way, he gets to relax for the remaining 350 days of the year. Ted re-enters the picture when he is jilted by Lila and finds himself in a drunken stupor dancing with Linda Mason, an aspiring singer-dancer whom Jim hires to perform at the inn. More romantic complications ensue until the inevitable happy ending, but the story is purely incidental compared with the songs.<br /><br />Director-producer Mark Sandrich ([[ASIN:B0009NSCQW Top Hat]]) keeps the story turns light enough to allow the performers to shine in their individual numbers. \\"White Christmas\\" is introduced as a duet between Crosby and Marjorie Reynolds (although her voice is dubbed albeit seamlessly by Martha Mears). Other standouts include \\"Easter Parade\\", \\"Lazy\\" and \\"Happy Holiday\\". Astaire gets to shine on the firecracker-popping \\"Say It with Firecrackers\\" and a nice duet with Virginia Dale on \\"You're Easy to Dance With\\". Unfortunately, Dale is given short shrift in the story as Lila, while the unjustly forgotten Reynolds plays Linda with unforced charm. The movie is not without a few duds, most notably the minstrel number, \\"Abraham\\", performed by Crosby and Reynolds in blackface.<br /><br />The three-disc 2008 DVD package contains the Special Edition 2006 DVD which offers an informative commentary track from film historian Ken Barnes sprinkled with archival remarks from Astaire, Crosby and Crosby's longtime music director, John Scott Trotter. Less interesting is the 45-minute documentary, \\"A Couple of Song & Dance Men: Ava Astaire McKenzie in Conversation with Ken Barnes\\" in which Barnes and Astaire's daughter converse in a most mechanical manner. There is also a seven-minute short about the film's musical numbers narrated by Barnes, \\"All Singing - All Dancing\\", as well as the original theatrical trailer. Disc Two provides a colorized version of the film as well as a featurette on how far colorizing technology has come.

0061120073|5.0|Reading this book felt like falling in love. It helped me re-connect with an appreciation for small pleasures and grow to appreciate the importance of how I look at the world around me.     A Tree Grows in Brooklyn changed my life more than any other book I've ever read. The first time I tried to read it, I thought the beginning was slow and didn't try it again for a few years. Oddly, the second time I picked it up, I couldn't put it down. Because I enjoyed this book so much, I sought out some of Betty Smith's other novels. While they were all moving and wonderful, this one is by far her best.     I think everyone should try this book.

B0006IIPIK|4.0|That's not a great film at all because it is a patchwork of special computerized effects and very conventional situations in that kind of science fiction catastrophic fantasy. And the myth of a new Noah's Ark that will take off this world to go we do not know where and will destroy the earth by taking off is as old as the world, if I can say so, from Ragnarok to the Apocalypse, and it takes a good old (way of speaking, quite in the age of possible procreation) heterosexual couple to save the earth from destruction by a project that was no longer managed by human scientist, since the last one had died more than twenty years before, but by a machine. But it is entertaining because it is so absurd that we do not even try to understand what is happening after a while, we just follow the lead or leash of you feel you can afford a more doglike nature. And we wait for the last spoken remark of that film \\"Lens cap\\" that is absolutely exhilaratingly funny.

B001FB4W0W|5.0|I agree with Sarah Lucy's 3 Star review,  however, I still love the series. No, I  haven't read the books and might not,  but I will admit that I'm now giving it   a second thought.     To me, Eric (the vampire sheriff of area 5)  seems like a secondary character. Yes, it  does seem like there are quite a few side  stories taking place simultaneously, and  who knows where the writers are going  with these, but they need to get there faster!    It is somewhat annoying that Sookie seems   to have forgotten or is unaware of things   that have previously taken place. I'm just   hoping that \\"True Blood\\" won't end up like   \\"Dead Like Me\\" or \\"Joan of Arcadia\\" and   is dropped after the second season due  to their offending the Religious Fundamentalists.    Anyway, let's hope that someone at HBO  does the right thing by the story line, as   well as, seeing to it that more attention is   focused on the details of Sookie's character  and dialogue.     There shouldn't be flaws in the main character's   dialogue. Someone is supposed to be checking on  these details, unless, they think we're stupid and   aren't noticing these missteps. I'll admit that I can   overlook some things to a point, but then I just stop   watching the nonsense when the writers, directors,   and producers are taking me for granted or are   dumbing down and fumbling with the script.     A few higher ups involved with this HBO production   aren't doing their jobs either and need to get this   back on track! The series should, eventually, cover   all five books. Anna, also, needs to pay more attention  to Sookie's character and speak up, especially, after   receiving a Golden Globe!

B0015AARJI|4.0|The controller fits great in most peoples hands.  I have large hands and its a very snug fit for me.  Not too small and not to large and bulky.    The weight is pretty light as well.  After hours and hours of using it, I do not feel worn out from just holding the thing like some controllers do.    The rumble part is very nice and not too intrusive.  In my opinion it adds to the feel of the games and when using a controller without it, it is just not the same experience.    The buttons are well laid out but thats pretty standard stuff.  The L2 & R2 buttons extend out a little too far though and sometimes I hit them by accident.    Being wireless really rocks here too.  I can go anywhere in the room and still get a solid signal.    I see a lot of offers out there for a Blu Ray remote but with these, who really needs that remote?  Save yourself some money and stick with this controller!    The battery pack does a decent job and its wonderfull that you can just recharge them instead of needing batteries.    Overall this is an awesome product.  I am very happy with it and my PS3.
038073186X|5.0|Why in the holy heck do the webmasters of this site allow people to give away the ending of books??!!  Stupid, selfish people -- listen up!  If you can't give your opinion without totally ruining it for everyone else, then keep your opinion to yourself.<br /><br />This is a really good read.  Yes, if you are a good puzzle solver or a logical thinker in general, you may catch on to a few things too early.  That is unfortunate. I wish the writer would have been a little more careful about that.  I would have been a lot more shocked if I wasn't so good at unscrambling letters.  Having said that, though, I still enjoyed the book very much.  Let yourself get lost in the story, don't overanalyze it, don't try-to-figure-it-out, don't unscramble the letters before the characters do, and you should enjoy it as well. Even if one of those idiotic selfish reviewers has spoiled the ending for you, the journey to get to that ending is still a very worthwhile read.

But if you haven't read Pillars, don't worry about it.  This work stands on its own.  It's big, over a thousand pages.  Don't let that dissuade you either.  It flows.  The characters will grab you and the plot will drag you along.  I enjoyed it; felt a bit of a letdown when it was over, I guess because the pleasure was over.  It's a good story.  I happen to like historical fiction.  It teaches so much in such a painless manner.  One has to be wary I suppose not to accept uncritically everything the writer of historical fiction proposes.  And it looks like Follett may have taken some liberties here unacceptable to some.  His characters speak, for example, in a modern vernacular.  However, thou's and thee's characteristic of the time would have seemed stilted, formal.  These are the archaic English equivalent of the Spanish familiar \\"tu\\" and \\"ti\\" but they sound formal to the modern ear.  Call it poetic license, it brings the book to life.<br /><br />The same with the sex, the homosexuality, the inhumanity of man to man, and worse, to woman, clerical turpitude.  I don't know much about the period, but I have no reason to suppose that people then were much different from what we are today, no matter our modern conceits.  I can't comment on the author's \\"technical\\" competence, but I know what I like.  Those that can, do, and in Follett's case, I can only stand in awe.  Wonderful work.  Discount the experts' carping and enjoy the ride.

0439023483|5.0|This is an amazing book. The fact that close to 300 people have reviewed it should tell you something.<br /><br />I am not a YA, but I love the genre. This was gritty, moving, emotional. I cried and laughed at parts. To all Mom's out there -please buy this book and read it.Then give to your daughter. You will love it. What an amazing blend of romance, fantasy and horror.<br /><br />The heroine Katniss, embodies girl power!<br />One of the best book I have read in a very long time.<br />Thankfully sequel will be out[[ASIN:0439023491 Catching Fire (The Second Book of the Hunger Games)]]in September.
0316067601|3.0|There are 3 distinct stories in this book.  First there is the story of Marcus Luttrell and his desire to be part of one of our nation's elite fighting units.  It is a story of boy who has a dream and actually acts on.  Many young boys dream of being pilot, fireman, or police officer but few carry through to actualize their dream; Marcus does.  The second story is about SEAL training and the depth of training as well as personal commitment it takes to earn the Trident.  There is no doubt that it is commitment that gets one through SEAL training, a level of commitment that very few within the Navy have.  The third and final story is that of Operation Redwing and the gut wrenching tale of heroism of lives lost in one of the most poorly conceived military missions of the Afghan campaign with idiotic rules of engagement.  Marcus and his comrades were put into a situation by military planners and policy wonks who have no idea of the actual conditions on the ground in Afghanistan.  Brave men paid the ultimate price for an ill conceived operation.  This book is worth the read and Marcus is to be commended not only for his bravery but for keeping his word.
B000Q6GX5Y|1.0|Do yourself a favor and buy a hunky guy calender and stare at it for 2 hours at least this way you don't have to hear this debacle. I like people less who say this is a good movie. Watch Braveheart again skip this one.
159102594X|4.0|This is an excellent book.     Upsides -   Plot - Masterfully thought out, with a riveting story linking perspectives together.     Characters - Diverse, interesting, and sometimes with downright funny dialogues / internal monologues. Great thing here is that we get a 'birds eye' view of the plot by following the protagonists in first person. Reminiscent of Jordan.    Writing - You can tell a lot of thought was put into this work (and the rest of the first law). Impeccable style, attention grabbing construction. Hardly ever a dull moment. You know how sometimes the writing, in description or dialogue will get bloated and boring? Won't happen here.    Downsides -   Considering the series as a whole, the pace notably slows in the second book, where the plot becomes more character driven - this may or may not be your cup of tea. The Blade Itself being inextricably part of the trio, I judge it in part by it's companions.    This work stands next to the best in fantasy.
B001LPWGE6|5.0|We just received our box set of the Bourne Trilogy and watched the first one last night. I have to say that I have rented these movies a few times on DVD and enjoyed them every time but the Blu-Ray version brought it up to a whole new level. The packaging is very cool with a magnetically sealed box that opens to reveal the three movies in the standard BD case.<br /><br />I was a little reluctant to pay +$40 for this version because our Samsung LN52A850 does such a fantastic job of up scaling our DVD's that it is often hard to tell the difference between a DVD and BD. After viewing The Bourne Identity I can tell you that it was well worth the extra money. The picture and sound were amazing and I enjoyed the movie like never before. I will say that the car chase scene was a little too loud for me compared to the rest of the movie and I ended up turning the volume down some for that. I think they could have toned it down some but that might just be me.<br /><br />The discs come with many extra features like BD live and I have not checked any of that stuff out so I can't provide any feedback on that but I will say they have done a first class job with this release and if you like the movies it is well worth it even if you already have them on DVD.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|I really liked this CD. I have recently discovered the wonderful sounds of Muse. This CD has one of my favorite songs on it, 'Super Massive Blackhole'. The other songs are just as good as this one. I recommend this CD as well as any other by Muse.
B000BCE918|5.0|My grandson Dylan LOVES Jurassic Park and dinosaurs, so I was very excited to find all 3 movies in one for him. He was truly thrilled to receive it for Christmas. Since he lives in another state I was not able to view the packaging but he says \\"It's got some really cool pictures on the box\\"
031606792X|4.0|I thoroughly (x10) enjoyed this last book in the Twilight saga. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed Breaking Dawn. After reading the synopsis and the two main reviews I was sceptical about how the birth giving part and the newborn baby story would unfold. I have to say Stephanie Meyers is an impressive storyteller, as I was not left with a quirky or gory feeling at all. In fact, I'm now interested to see how the movie is going to turn out without having it become a freaky horror show! Now that I've completed this saga, I can go back to spending more quality time with my husband, which I'm sure he will appreciate! Thank you for the writing, Ms. Meyers.
031606792X|1.0|I still haven't received the book that I ordered more than a month ago and have not been given a refund! Do your research people! Don't ever buy from this seller!
B000V86OKG|5.0|Season One was great, and Season Two hits the ground running fast.  I have only watched two episodes thus far, but can safely say that first-time viewers of this series will likely not be able to avoid cheering for this Bad Guy.  Although Dexter is a serial killer, he's a bad guy that wears a white hat.

B001LF4IA6|5.0|According to REM's Michael Stipe, the most difficult song to write is a happy song.   If that is true, then writing  \\"Working on a Dream\\" was Mr. Springsteen's most arduous labor during his nearly forty year and twenty-five album career.   \\"Working on a Dream\\" is filled with joyous themes and music throughout without almost any detours.   Maybe inspired by the change of administration in Washington DC, \\"A Dream\\" lays out a course of happy days ahead.   This album is beautifully sung, probably Mr. Springsteen's best vocal work of the decade.   The music is crisp and clean, sounding like something from the mid-1960s pop revolution.   The lyrics are less complex than previous albums, but \\"A Dream\\" still has something to say.      The joy ride on E Street begins with \\"My Lucky Day,\\" the song Mr. Springsteen perhaps will use from this album to open his new tour.   It is very catchy, something the Beatles might have included in  \\"Revolver.\\"    Mr. Springsteen voice is spot on.   The E Street's bassist, Garry W. Tallent, often doesn't get the attention he deserves in a band full of superstars, but his bass work on this song stands out.    Using games of chance as a metaphor for romance, Mr. Springsteen suggests we should lay our money down on love.  The title track follows,  showing that dreams can be a safe wager too.  I also like \\"Surprise, Surprise,\\" another happy tune, singing about surprise birthday wishes and opening one's eyes to the possibility of life.  In \\"Kingdom of Days,\\" the Boss reminds us of the benefits of longevity in relationships backed with music as spiritual as a church hymn.      \\"Queen of the Supermarket\\" is Mr. Springsteen at his whimsical best, returning to a theme he has covered so well before (e.g., \\"Cynthia\\" in \\"Tracks\\"), unrequited love, but this time at the grocery store checkout counter.  I could have done without the use of the f-word in the lyrics, but this is a song that is pure fun to listen to.  \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" is very cool, as ifthe E Street Band never broke a sweat to record it.  (Think of Chris Isaak's \\"Baja Sessions.\\")    As with \\"Magic,\\"  Mr. Springsteen closes with a heartfelt eulogy to a deceased friend, the longtime, original organist for the E Streeters, Dan Federici.   In the \\"The Last Carnival,\\" you feel the sorrow of the band made close by life on the road and what it will mean for the show to gone on without him.     The opening track, \\"Outlaw Pete,\\" finds Mr. Springsteen returning to the mini-epic format he perfected in \\"Racing in the Street\\" or \\"Thunder Road.\\"  Perhaps reflecting his current interests, rather that writing about urban escapism, Mr. Springsteen turns again thematically to the West just like he did in  \\"Devils & Dust.\\"  Like the Who's Tommy, after years of inflecting death and pain, Outlaw Pete story ends with plaintive screams, \\"Can you hear me?\\"  Although not an overtly political album, one wonders if the line whispered by Dan who just lost a knife fight with Outlaw Pete that \\"[w]e cannot undo these things we've done\\"  is an allusion to the departing administration?    If there is social meaning in \\"Outlaw Pete,\\" then certainly the title track can be interpreted as an acknowledgment of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream and our unfinished work to fulfill it.   It is a fitting coincidence that during the inaugural festivities Mr. Springsteen sang at the Lincoln Memorial on the same steps that Dr. King gave his \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech.      Who would have thought at the turn of century that Mr. Springsteen and the E Street Band would have given us some much great work by the end of the century's first decade?   Much like John Lennon's \\"lost weekend\\" in the early 1970s, many have opined that the 1990s were Mr. Springsteen's \\"wilderness years\\" and they would have certainly  predicted more of the same to follow at the start of the century.   (Actually, I  think his work during the 1990s is underestimated and deserves a listen. )   With most of  his rock and roll contemporaries doing oldies tours, Mr. Springsteen and the E Street Band seem to have found a second wind . . . and then a third.       Besides \\"A Dream,\\" Mr. Springsteen has provided a stunning musical review and commentary on the last administration in \\"Magic,\\" a trip to the old West with \\"Devils & Dust,\\"  and  the Peter Seeger inspired folk masterpiece, \\"We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions.\\"    All excellent, but his best work is probably the reflection on 9/11, \\"The Rising,\\" which can make a case for top album of the century.  With the addition of \\"A Dream\\" to Mr. Springsteen's unparallel popular  songbook, we are lucky to be living in the present with one of the greatest rock and roll artist and band ever assembled . . . or likely to be assembled in the future.   For those who see the greater possibilities of rock and roll music,  Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band  are  much more than rock musicians, providing a moral compass often missing in contemporary life and spreading hope, faith, and love along the way.
0345440927|4.0|When some friends recommend me the first book, baby whisperer, I thought \\"ok, just another miracle book for parents which finally would turn out into another bunch of useless recommendations\\" but time proved I was definitively wrong. It is indeed a miracle of common sense and experience and the second one, baby whisperer for toddlers, is another helpful and sometimes miraculous guide through the first years of parenthood. I strongly recommend this two books to every new parent.
B000002O5L|5.0|Music is indelibly linked to the era in which it is first unleashed on the public. If you compiled a soundtrack of the late 80s, Full Moon Fever would feature prominantly - even the little \\"hello CD listeners\\" blurb can't help but remind us of the days when music shops actually were stocked to the brim with cassettes, and the little silver discs were only just being embraced by the public. Top to bottom this is one of the most radio friendly albums I've ever heard. I suppose some might see that as a failing, but if you like solid musicianship, melodic hooks, and lyrics that may be moving one moment and goofy the next, then grab this brilliant gem.
B001CLG6RC|5.0|Of all the Enigma albums I can compare it to, I'd say this is most similar to The Cross Of Changes. On this new album, Cretu goes for a \\"worldbeat\\" feel, which implements many of the cultural elements he's woven throughout his music already.<br />Yet this album is a return to form. After the mostly vocal-free A Posteriori, this album brings back many of the beautiful voices and melodies as before, this time including his own children on \\"The Same Parents.\\"<br /><br />Highlights include the almost hip-hop influenced \\"7 Lives\\", and \\"La Puerta Del Cielo\\" evokes the classic \\"Return to Innocence\\" with the voice of a beautiful woman chanting throughout, while the music ebbs and flows along with her.<br /><br />Its recommended to buy the double disc edition of this album, as there were several instrumentals composed for this album. The heavy industrial keyboards on \\"Hells Heaven\\" and soft budding beats on \\"Downtown Silence\\" show that Cretu is making excellent progress with The Alchemist (a workstation he's composed the last 2 albums with).<br /><br />What more can be said? It's Enigma, of course it's going to be great! Go out and buy this album today!!!

B000J5XS3C|5.0|I bought this board for my husband who had recently finished building a recording studio in our house. He has used it for voice-overs and to record his band and has been overwhelmingly satisfied with both its quality and efficiency. I recommend it for anyone looking for an affordable mixer to use at home.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|If you haven't heard them before Sigur Rós may seem a bit weird with the high breaking vocals and ambient effects mixed into the pulsing rhythmic backbone that constitutes the majority of their music. I found this album more accessible than most of their others though, and would recommend it for those looking to give Sigur Rós a try. It's also my favorite album of theirs.    I found almost the entire album enjoyable, and I can't say enough about the two standout tracks, Glósóli and Sæglópur. Glósóli is a lesson on how to form a build, Sæglópur's piano part catches you from the start and really carries the song well, and both of them have an uncanny ability to make you feel as if you could just lift off the ground and soar into the sky. If that's the kind of music you're looking for I doubt this album will disappoint.

031606792X|3.0|First let me say I was a very late-comer to the Twilight series.  When I was finally persuaded to read them I was hooked.  I adore the romance and impossibility of Edward and Bella's love.  Edward is so devoted and the perfect gentleman.  Bella is so alike myself in high school it is scary.  Having said that, I must say Breaking Dawn was a definite break from the other three books.  I don't think it deserves the wrath it has incurred, but it is the worst of all four for these four reasons:  (I will try to keep the spoilers to a minimum)  1. This book reminded me of who had written it.  Meaning one of the reasons I had not read them before is because I was not convinced someone who was so conservative could write a romance that would interest someone like me who is NOT conservative at all.  I was pleasantly surprised thought to find that it was so old school and turn of the century love that I didn't mind it. Edward and Bella are so forthcoming about their feelings in New Moon and Eclipse I was reading the same pages over and over again, swooning.  But with Breaking Dawn her views overshadowed this.  The writing deviated so much from the other three and you could just see the author consulting with her religious leaders on how to proceed, it ruined the romance.  2. I would have loved to hear some vows during the wedding.  All the professing and declaring of love in the other books in my mind should have foreshadowed a moving wedding ceremony.  But no, we get more of a description of the decorations than of the actual ceremony.  Where were the promises of undying love?  The exclamations of joy?  She could have done a lot more with this and it was seriously dissapointing.  3. Reneesme.  I won't even go into the whole vampire as a biological father thing here because she deviated so much from standard vampire lore in the other books as well, as readers we should be used to this. (Not to mention, she clearly sets a difference between male and female vampire hybrids at the end with males being venemous and females not, so why wouldn't male vampires be able to procreate?) And please don't get me wrong kids are great, I love mine but...Any parent will tell you that the idea of having kids is more romantic than actually having them.  Nothing kills romance faster than a little one LOL.  Having said that 90% of me loving the previous books was because of Edward being so quick with all his declaring and professing of undying, selfless love and we get none of that once Bella gets pregnant.  We never get them emoting over the baby once she comes either. And what was up with Edward offering Bella to Jacob like that? Even all the sneaking into windows to watch her sleep and following her around was not even a tiny bit as creepy as that.  But I digress....I could think of a few different plots that would have brought down the Volturi on the Cullens without Reneesme. And finally....  4. The writing was just not what it was in the first three.  I did like it being split in point of view, but if she was going to do that she could have shortened Jacobs section and added Edwards thoughts, or maybe had a section dedicated to just the Cullens and how they all felt seperately, like journal entries maybe, I don't know.  Anything could have been better.  I realize adding Edward could put a damper on Midnight Sun, but she can't expect to put all four books into that one and how far does she really want to go with \\"Edward's Story\\".  Granted I would love her to do all four again from his perspective.  I have read the first 200 or so pages she has on stepheniemeyer.com of Midnight Sun and I can't wait.  But anyway...this book did not suck me in like the rest.  She ties everything in together and packages it all up in a nice bow (minus Bella's mother, we never do find out how she is going to deal with that). But it seems like she was just too under the gun, and did not really think everything out.  The same thing happened to Anne Rice (Tale of the Body Snatcher anyone?).  All in all, Stephenie Meyer created a wonderful series but was either rushed or out of ideas when it came to the final installment.
B000063DIR|1.0|This and the Blizzard reissues are redone with Mike Bordin playing drums and Robert Trujillo on bass. Sharon and Ozzy have had a long fued with Lee Kerslake and Bob Daisley over royalties, so they get out of paying them if they just take the original drum and bass tracks off the reissues. This is a shame because a huge portion of the \\"magic\\" of those two Randy Rhoads albums was Lee's and Bob's excellent playing and contributions. Heck, Bob was a key songwriter on those.    Tommy Aldridge and Rudy Sarzo are pictured and credited on the original \\"Diary\\", which I always found odd, because Lee and Bob actually played on the record.   Sharon claimed that Ozzy wanted to re-record these with his drummer and bassist at that time to get a 'fresher sound'. Bunk! Spite and greed. Plus the whole feel of Diary and Blizzard is wrong, wrong, wrong. I took my old cds of these and burned multiple copies. So the originals are in my \\"vault\\" never to be played again. I will just re-burn them if I wear them out or scratch them.    I have been a HUGE early Ozzy fan since 1982, and this smacks of desicration(spelling)!! Randy made these records with Lee Kerslake and Bob Daisley, and thats the way they should have stayed.

0060987464|4.0|[[ASIN:0060987464 The Long Hard Road Out of Hell]]   Marilyn Manson's book is a lot like his stage persona, shocking, intelligent, rebellious, and a bit exaggerated and contrived.  It's a fun quick read.  Parts of it are brilliant commentary on the people in Manson's life from growing up to becoming a star, life in the music industry, and society in general.  Manson is obviously a smart guy and a good writer.  That really shines through in parts of the book, like it does in the finer, higher-intellectual level parts of his music and stage show.  However, even in the book, he never forgets to appeal to the cheap seats,too.  He makes sure to include the tons of the shocking rock and roll debauchery that one would expect from a heavy metal memoir.  Some of the things he mentions sound pretty authentic, but some feel a bit less than genuine.  There's a bit of a feel of the book being artistry in places,not necessarily fully invented, but exaggerated for effect.

B0009X766Y|5.0|This movie is a classic. Fun, Newman is exceptional, Redford is playful, the cast is like watching a bunch a seasoned veterans not even trying but pulling off a great acting caper on us all. And Robert Shaw is brilliant.     I'm not a big fan of the long drawn out one camera shot scenes from that era, but this was executed so well, that I didn't even notice it.     It's no wonder this swept up so many Oscars. it was just that brilliant for its time, and has stood the test of time. Fun and exciting with a great climax.
B000G0O5N2|5.0|Great film. The image has too much grain in my opinion, however it's the movie language not a defect.
0142000655|5.0|I just finished this novel a few hours ago after 3 days of continuous reading. This will probably be one of my favorite books i've ever read. One who reads the book will grow with adam, cal, aron and lee. I don't read much but i cannot give this book enough stars. So descriptive, one will get lost in the dusty west.
B000Q6GUW0|3.0|This series did not appeal to me when it first came out. A series about a serial killer just did not interest me, but I heard so many good things I broke down and rented the entire First Season. It was much different than I expected, for the good.<br /><br />This is well written and even when you know what is going to happen, the way they do it completely surprises you. The narrative done by Dexter, puts you in his head so it gives you a very different perspective. If you are the same as me, and skiped this because you didn't want to watch a story about a serial killer, I tell you to watch this series. It will surprise you in a good way if you like thrillers.<br /><br />My BUT, is my high expectations for a Showtime or HBO series. In these series I'm looking for \\"Shock and Awe\\" that I can't see on regular TV. If your going to have a sex scene, have a SEX SCENE. Don't show me what I can see on NYPD Blue. I expect more. In this area, I was very disappointed in Dexter. The same goes for the violence and action. Give me what I can't see on regular TV. Shock me. The series did fail to do this for me.<br /><br />I do look forward to watching the Second Season now, and hope it improves from the First Season. The series is good enough for me to keep watching despite my disappointments.<br /><br />UPDATE: I now have watched the entire series and though I do stand by my original review, but I will add that this was a great series, especially Season 4 with John Lithgow. The last episode of Season 4 will take you breath away. The series is very well written and sets you expectations very high which unfortunately will let you down in the last season. The last season was not horrible but it was a disappointment and left me feeling they should have ended it the season before.
B001LRJH0U|1.0|I am a fan of Ed Harris and was really looking forward to his first film as a director. The film started off very interesting and exciting but slowly went downhill after that. The story is very simple and nothing about it is unique or very interesting. I am not a fan of Renee Zellweger and her performance in this movie reminded me why. The movie switches back and forth between action and romance. The action isn't bad but the characters often do things that make no sense at all. And the romance is very unbelievable and just seems like an excuse to move the plot along. I really wanted to like this movie but I couldn't find any reason to.
B001AQO3WY|4.0|I never read [[ASIN:0425224740 Generation Kill]]. I never watched the miniseries. But the members of a particular Internet forum I frequent wouldn't stop talking about it, so I rented it from Netflix. I was hooked from the first episode. Last week I finished the series and ordered the book. Before viewing the series, I had decided NOT to read the book, based on critical reviews by some military reviewers. The tone of the series didn't put me off, and I wanted to read the source material. Besides, I like to make my own decisions, and I made the right one for me.<br /><br />I did four years in a Marine infantry unit and went to the first Gulf War, so, not surprisingly, I have an interest in Marine Corps stories. I read [[ASIN:0965767035 Jarhead: a Marine's Chronicle of the Gulf War and Other Battles]] and liked it, because the author's experiences echoed my own. I enjoyed the movie adaptation, but there was an element of fantasy to it that caused me to keep it at arm's length, so to speak. It's the gritty realism of \\"Generation Kill\\" that really pulls me in.<br /><br />In terms of recreating my experiences, GK is scary-accurate. I wasn't with a recon unit and I didn't go into Iraq, but I dug my share of fighting holes and put up way more than my share of cammie nets, and I did my fair share of grousing about the Big Green [Machine]. The guys' sitting around and complaining about anything and everything--and particularly their officers--is spot-on. So if the officers come across as less than competent, it's because the story is told from the point of view of the enlisted men. No surprise there. The characters and their bickering and camaraderie really resonated with me, and by the end of the series I felt as if I knew the guys. Like [[ASIN:B00129H7VS Band of Brothers]] before it, GK's casting is remarkable. Alexander Skarsgard is magnetic. And like Person says, \\"You're not gay if you think Rudy is hot.\\"<br /><br />It will be many years before I can share this series with my son, but when he is old enough I will.

B00092QUQC|5.0|Look, don't let their name mislead you. The Gotthard Pass and tunnel through the alps are landmarks in Switzerland, so they are paying homage to their country, which is part of their charm. I was lucky enough to catch a show of GOTTHARD'S in Germany when they were on tour last year with DEEP PURPLE. It is easy to say they were amazing, but until you hear for yourselves the depth and quality of their musicianship, you can't even begin to understand. It is like they are a rock band that perform with the integrity of a symphony orchestra. And now that I have bought this CD and DOMINO EFFECT(their newest)and MADE IN SWITZERLAND(which includes both CD and DVD of a live concert in Zurich, you can't stop watching it, especially the bonus videos of the set up for the filming of the live concert and the making of the video for their single: ANYTIME, ANYWHERE), I am even more impressed. What I saw at the concert and on the DVD is exactly what you hear on the CD's! Steve Lee is a phenomenon - he could sing any song. He has a voice like Freddie Mercury with a range like an opera or Broadway star. He also has tremendous personality and energy. Leo Leoni is a virtuoso guitar player; some of his solos make you want to cry (okay, yes, I am a girl), and he has great fun onstage, but more than that, he produces their albums, and he and Steve Lee write most of their songs (all in English), which in itself is amazing considering their native languages are Italian and German. Hena, the \\"like a drum machine\\" drummer and Freddie, the other brilliant guitar player and Nicolo, a stunning keyboard player are all so good, they make the current popular US and British bands look like need to take a few music lessons. Yeah, it's 80's & 90's melodic rock, but GOTTHARD really does it best; they put you deep inside the music and move you, whether they're playing hard rock or a ballad. And I don't care if they are in their forties - after fifteen years of touring and making records, they have perfected their art - they ROCK!  If they toured here, word of mouth would have the concerts sold out in minutes. And everyone would experience one of the best night of their lives!If you buy LIPSERVICE, beware, you will want to buy their other CD's!
B000M9BPEY|2.0|It's a very good film, however the image quality isn't very good... some scenes looks like DVD.
B001DU8T6S|3.0|Overall, this is a promising debut from QPR. The music is tight and Paul Rogers still has a healthy set of lungs on him. From the musical side, this sounds great. My quibble with this album is not the music, it's the inane lyrics on at least a few of the tracks -- most notably the \\"Cosmos Rockin'\\" opener and \\"Surfs Up! School's Out\\". They're just, well, juvenile. Like the band themselves, Queen and Paul Rogers' fan base have grown up. Songs about loud parties and school being out don't quite resonate and just come off as being immature. Others, such as the ballad \\"We Believe\\" have too much trite sweetness. One has to wonder why someone, a producer or some other adult never pulled the boys aside to suggest lyrics that might resonate with the post high-school age crowd a bit more.    Perhaps I'm overstating the albums weaknesses however. By and large, this isn't bad - probably more a 3 1/2 star offering than a 3, but I can't get past the lyrics enough to round it up to four stars. It's refreshing to see one of the bands I admired in my youth push out in a new direction, and not getting a Freddie impersonator (See Foreigner, Journey, etc.) was a wise decision. Paul Rogers is definitely his own man, and definitely a powerful voice. I can't fault him for not being Freddie -- no one can fill those shoes.    I hope QPR continue with future releases (featuring lyrics for adults), and it would be nice to have John Deacon return to the fold as well. Perhaps it's also time to give Spike Edney, who has been backing the band with keyboards and rhythym guitar since the 1980's his due as a full fledged band member. Queen has been sleeping with Spike for over 20 years - perhaps its time they got married.
031606792X|4.0|Breaking Dawn was very interesting.  There was a lot going on and although I loved the book and the whole saga for that matter, I thought some things were a bit odd and I think I wish things could have happened differently.  But I was pleased at the end and would definately read it again.
B001EOQWEO|5.0|Boy, it's a good thing I love this movie, or I'd be in a bad way right now. Not a day has gone by since we bought this DVD (shortly after Christmas) that we don't play it. Sometimes it's the only thing my son will watch, although he occasionally mixes things up with [[ASIN:B000A2IPP0 E.T. - The Extra-Terrestrial]] or [[ASIN:B00005JM02 Finding Nemo]]. What's funny--or maybe scary--is that he knew who WALL-E was before we even bought the movie. It seems to be helping him with his vocabulary, though: \\"Wah-wee\\" is his second favorite word (\\"moon\\" is his first) and \\"Eeee\\" runs a close third.<br /><br />Each time I watch the movie I marvel at the Pixar team's skill at telling a story. I'm always finding new things to look at, and appreciating the elements they used to create a tale that is more than complete (the interplay between the computer's explanation of dancing and the scenes of WALL-E and EVE cavorting in space, for example).<br /><br />My major gripe with the DVD is that you're forced to watch (or forced to skip) about seven commercials for Disney products before you even get to the main menu, and then you have to watch two warning screens and another Disney splash page before the movie starts. It gets old very quickly.<br /><br />That said, WALL-E is well worth the price. It's top-quality entertainment for the whole family.
B000V86OKG|4.0|I have read all 3 Dexter novels and thoroughly enjoy the character.  It is not often that the hero is a \\"serial killer\\".  The box set certainly helps to bring the printed word to life.  I cannot wait to get the third season when it comes out.

B00129H7VS|5.0|I have known about Band of Brothers for a while now but did not see it until about a month ago, WOW is all I can say.  Incredible story and detail , it just captures you and what makes this even better is knowing the characters are real.  I ended up buying it and started rewatching it with the interactive features, it is a whole new experience now.  I have started to read the book as well.  This is worth every  penny!! I can't believe it took me so long to discover this. My husband did not want to watch it when I first rented it but he was the one to tell me to buy it when we watched it for the first time.  Give it a rent or buy it , you will not be dissapointed.
B001HIJYR4|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the action, pace and special effects. The storyline kept me involved throughout the film.  The cast was excellent.  I am a big fan of Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman.
B000TKW3E2|4.0|Marianelli's score is nicely unified and tight, an example of good composing. The two main themes are clear and distinct, often intertwining in the first several cues. I like how he uses the sound of the typewriter to influence the music, though I think it could have been done more subtly with greater effect. See John Ottman's 'Point of Origin' for another example of this. In fact, this score was so unified that I easily lost track of where one cue ended and another began. What sounds like background music on the first run through can often be very moving on closer examination. I keep wanting to insert the descriptor \\"complex\\", but the fact is that such a term doesn't serve here. The score is rather simple in terms of thematic motif, but I don't say that as necessarily a negative thing. I was a little confused by the cue \\"Two Figures by a Fountain\\", for it felt fast-paced, not what I might expect of such a tender or tense moment as the cue name suggests.     A cue that really jumped out at me from the first several is \\"The Half Killed.\\" Here Marianelli breaks away from the solo piano or light chamber orchestra that define the earlier cues and engages the listener with deep, lush music reminiscent of a dramatic action film. Much of the film's music is played in a soft minor key, bringing to mind a detached sadness, a regret. \\"The Half Killed\\" closes the distance abruptly and paints a haunted, pained picture. Here is where the old wound starts to bleed again. Unfortunately, like most of the cues, this one was too short for my liking. Marinelli doesn't try to force his motifs down our throats, and I wished to give him more time to develop the music, to find out where he wanted to go with it. Occasionally it felt like the cues were afflicted with Sudden Cue Syndrome and dying prematurely.     The highlight of the latter half of the score, if not the entire thing, is the aforementioned \\"Elegy for Dunkirk.\\" Perhaps most surprising because it breaks with the style and theme Marianelli previously sets for us, or maybe because it is the most complex and musical piece on the album. Most telling is the theme in minor keep gradually being subsumed by a boys' choir, which is singing in a major key. Surprisingly, the conflicting keys do not clash as one might think. It is a poignant, touching piece of music, easily my favorite on the album. Almost as surprising is the sudden introduction of an organ in the next track, \\"Come Back.\\" To my ear it was a welcome addition, as I can only handle so much restrained British melodrama. The boys' choir and organ are synonymous with England to my mind and ear, but the organ also brings to mind situations when it is used: sacred instances of life and death - weddings or funerals. The last few cues end with a whisper of what began the score, fading into the mists of memory. Debussy's Clair de Lune is a curious if not unwelcome footnote to the score, performed beautifully by Jean-Yves Thibaudet.     Again, this is a very enjoyable score with some really heart-achingly beautiful music. The use of choir and organ light the desire to hear more of the composer's efforts in this area. One of the biggest problems I had with the score is that because so much of it is soft, speculative, and reflective, it is very easy to gloss right over it if you're not paying rigid attention. The last few cues are especially forgettable. It would have enjoyed longer cues too, but that may be entirely a personal taste, though some still felt truncated. The typewriter motif becomes a little cliche by the end of the score, but works well as a unifying piece. Since much of the music is restrained, it begs the question of what Marianelli could do if he let himself go a bit more. I was surprised to find out how young he was, but it gives me hope that the excellent orchestral score will not entirely give way to synthesized sound in the coming years. I was interested to later learn the score had one best Oscar; while good, I conclude the year's score selection must have been somewhat weak for it to have won. I look forward to more of Marinaelli's work and hope he decides to experiment in his choice of film genres.
B000NA2BEU|5.0|Veronica Mars is no longer made, but even so it still has to be one of the best series to come out of the USA. The third series is as brilliant as series one & two - (equally must haves for your DVD collection). It's concept is a mix between a female Sherlock Holmes meeting Beverly Hills, 90210. Veronica Mars is played by Kristen Bell who gives a blow away performance supported by an equally talented supporting cast. The writing is also in a league of its own and the quality of production is far above the norm. The one-liners coupled with the strong characters guarantees a great viewing experience. The series finished due to not having enough viewers. This was mainly due to very little publicity and having its US schedule changed weekly. I have loaned my three box sets to friends who cannot believe they had never heard or seen this brilliant series in the UK. I guarantee once you start watching this show you will be hooked and very disappointed it is no longer in production. RIP Veronica Mars you were the best ever.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|DR. HORRIBLE is wonderful! I would recommend to anyone who has a sense of humor to buy this and just sit back and watch. The ending did surprise me, but I think it was the only way to end it successfully. Kudos to all the actors.

B001041JLE|4.0|The album Thriller was already great. The 25th anniversary Deluxe edition is even better. The remixes arent all that great, but the booklet is beautiful and its a must-have for collectors.  The biggest selling album of all time is not something everyone can make, only Michael Jackson. And 25 years holding that world record deserves a celebration and a special edition release like this.

B00005RYKV|5.0|Many Takeshi Kitano fans hate this film but I actually find it to be his most enjoyable. If you liked Sonatine, then you will like this. However this is the American version of the film and it is HEAVILY CUT AND EDITED! Poorly cut and edited too may I also point out. Some parts which were clear and easy to understand in the original become confusing due to the editing. Have no fear THE ORIGINAL UNCUT VERSION IS EASY TO FIND. I recommend this edition of the film: [[ASIN:B001O23YHY Brother (Uncut release!)]] which is awesome.
B000G7PNAE|5.0|In my opinion, this album is Journey's greatest! I love every song! I strongly recommend this album who love the band and Steve Perry's voice!
B000W91RUG|5.0|I must admit that I didn't think that I was going to like Big Bang theory.  It's not that I can't relate to the subject matter; I am both a nerd and a geek.  The show just didn't sound interesting.  Boy was I wrong (and glad that my girlfriend picked up a copy).  Big Bang Theory is one of the few things on television right now that is actually funny.  Unlike most sitcoms you will run across, Big Bang theory comes across as smart without feeling pretentious.  The main characters are physicists, an engineer, and the hot blond across the hall.    Unlike most television, Big Bang theory doesn't make the assumption that its audience is too stupid to get its jokes.  It doesn't go into painful explanations of every scientific or geek culture reference made in the show.  This is not to say that you have to be a nerd or geek to enjoy the show.  The writers do a great job of making the material accessible to everyone.

B00192KCQ0|5.0|I got this album when I ordered tix to their concert back in September.  I listened to it maybe once and did not like it.  I saw Metallica at Nassau Veteran's Memorial Coliseum and they were AWESOME.  I've been listening to this CD ever since; can't pull it out of my CD changer.  It grows on you like some kind of monster.    Favorite song is \\"Broken, Beat & Scarred\\".
B0018CWEYY|4.0|I'm only basing the rating score on the fact that it was a shorter season, yet I still had to pay the same price as a full 24-episode season.  And, the bloopers are shorter. Bummer.  The rest of the Special Features are as interesting to watch as any other boxed season.  And, I like which episodes the commentaries are on.  Personally, I think Carlton Cuse talks too much about what I don't care to know about the production.  However, commentaries with Damon Lindelof and any of the cast are so cool to listen to.

B00127RAJY|4.0|I started this workout routine 3 days ago (only 27 days left, lol!) and I think it's a pretty solid, high energy and effective work out. I'm in relatively good shape and work out ~5/6 days a week - but mostly cardio. That said, the strength portions of Jillian's work out make some of my lesser used muscles hate her - like my lower calves. Mad sore, but hoping that'll dissipate by next week. I started with Level I but found that only warmed me up so I moved onto Level II right away. Currently I'm combining both Level I and II (for a 40 min session) and it's kicking my a$$ - which is exactly what I  bought this for. I'm hoping to move on to Level III by next week. All in all, it's a really good workout that goes by really quickly, but it's probably extra tough if you aren't in shape yet. If you are in shape, I'd recommend combining or going straight to Level III to feel more of a challenge - but whatever your level - you'll definitely sweat.

B001GSV3EC|5.0|I very rarely write reviews any more, but I have to say I was mesmerized by Jeff's playing on this set.  I haven't listened to any of his music in several years.  He is so fluid and creative - a true gift from God.  After listening to Satriani for several years and then hearing this concert, it's obvious Jeff must have had a huge influence on Joe.  They're both great guitarists, but Jeff has a unique sound that's impossible to replicate. I'd love to have a front row seat at one of his shows.
1433502437|5.0|I wanted to buy the Premium Calfskin, but was hesitant at spending over $150 on a Bible that I couldn't actually feel before I plunked down the cash to see if it was worth it. I decided to take a chance and am glad I did! The quality of the Premium Calfskin is outstanding! It is so soft and pliable, yet feels sturdy and durable at the same time. I thought the binding was very well done and this Bible that has over 2700 pages in it stays open no matter where you open it up be it Genesis 1 or Revelation 22. This thing is quality from start to finish.    As others have stated, the notes, articles, maps, etc. are very helpful and well done.    My only quibble is how come a Bible of this price and quality does not have the words of Christ in red? That seems a little odd, but I won't let that keep me from enjoying this wonderful Bible for many, many years to come.
0316017922|4.0|Early advantages plus talent plus lots of practice plus a good social heritage plus a large opportunity help people succeed. That's this book in a nutshell as described in a series of New Yorker style articles. As told, the story is much more entertaining than that, but I want you to get the essence.  Mr. Gladwell knows how to pick and spin a story to make it appealing and intriguing, and he has done well on those dimensions here.<br /><br />The book will inspire people to want to help others accomplish more. Any parent, any teacher, any coach, or anyone interested in improving society will find something stimulating here.<br /><br />Let me give you a quick overview:<br /><br />1. Mr. Gladwell draws his inspiration for this book from the studies of Roseto, Pennsylvania by Dr. Stewart Wolf and sociologist John Bruhn that established how social factors can improve or harm health. Mr. Gladwell wants to similarly expand our vision of what affects success beyond the sense that \\"raw talent\\" and \\"privilege\\" help.<br /><br />2. Mr. Gladwell uses the birth dates of athletes to establish that annual cutoff dates for teams benefit those born closer to the cutoff date. This principle also affects school children. As a result, the older children in a cohort do better and get more attention. Mr. Gladwell proposes having more anniversary dates so that more youngsters will get early access to help and attention.<br /><br />3. Mr. Gladwell tells us the background of Bill Joy, one of the great computer programming geniuses of all time. In the story, he points out that mastery of most disciplines requires 10,000 hours of practice. Mr. Joy got that practice at a young age because he had access to time sharing on a mainframe when most programmers didn't. The practice point is buttressed by a study of violinists that correlates how much they practiced to their ultimate success. Then, Mr. Gladwell pulls in the Beatles and Bill Gates as examples to support his point. He also looks at the frequency of accumulating large wealth to notice it is concentrated in one time period in one country.<br /><br />4. From there, he gives us the sad story of a genius who hasn't been able to use his life for very much other than to win on a television game show, Christopher Langan. Mr. Gladwell goes on to argue that you have to be talented enough to succeed, but that talent level falls far below the genius level.<br /><br />5. Mr. Gladwell next points out that parenting matters. Mr. Langan had little help there, but many privileged youngsters get enormous assistance which provides direct help and makes them more assertive.<br /><br />6. Joe Flom is profiled next to describe his background before becoming the head of a major New York Law firm, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom. Great emphasis is placed on his being Jewish, so he couldn't work in the \\"white shoe\\" firms that didn't want to get their hands dirty with hostile takeovers; being born when takeover lawyers could do well; and being born into a family with a social heritage of prospering in the garment trade (a very exacting business that rewarded hard work and attention to detail).<br /><br />7. Mr. Gladwell expands on the idea of a sociological legacy in part two, beginning with the apparent roots of Southern family feuds (think of the Hatfields and the McCoys). He next takes a look at how such social patterns appear to have affected airline safety (with a close look at Korean Air and an Avianca plane that crashed when it ran out of fuel). He then jumps across the globe to argue that the Chinese language's structure of words that involve numbers and the work involved in cultivating rice explain the advantages that many Southern Chinese students have in math over students in other parts of the world.<br /><br />8. The story moves into its prescriptive stage in describing the results of an experimental public school in the South Bronx that helped youngsters get the structure and discipline they need to succeed . . . with very good results.<br /><br />9. The book concludes with a look at Mr. Gladwell's Jamaican roots and how those contributed to his success.<br /><br />Mr. Gladwell is such a provocative and intriguing writer that it seems rude to make any suggestions for possible improvement. However, I will be so bold as to comment on the ideas and the evidence.<br /><br />1. Mr. Gladwell doesn't seem to take liking the task into account as a success factor. Most of us could eat chocolate candy until 10,000 hours had occurred. But how many of us like any other task that much that can be turned into a valuable form of human achievement? Without such liking, I suspect that much success won't occur. Self-discipline in the absence of liking will just lead to early burnout.<br /><br />2. Mr. Gladwell seems a little confused about the contribution Bill Gates has made to software. Mr. Gladwell tells the Gates story as though Gates is another Bill Joy. Gates is more of a corporate strategist than a programming success. The famous programs on which Microsoft's success was based were drawn primarily from the work of programmers who weren't even at Microsoft.<br /><br />3. In the airline crash examples, there is also a lot of research about how crews in all countries defer too much to the captains. Although that research is mentioned in passing, I felt like Mr. Gladwell was overstating his point. The issue in the Avianca crash was strongly related to not speaking American-style English with comfort. I think the book would have been stronger without the airline crash examples.<br /><br />4. When you are writing about success (even as \\"outliers\\"), it makes sense to spend a little more time thinking about what you want to focus on. This book jumps from looking at geniuses who do things that benefit everyone (like Bill Joy) to people who just happen to make a lot of money (Joe Flom). If Mr. Gladwell had stuck with Bill Joy-type examples, I think this book would have been a lot more helpful.<br /><br />5. If these points are so important, wouldn't it make sense to have the bulk of the book prescribe what to do differently? Mr. Gladwell doesn't take that part very seriously. As a result, the book is more entertainment than call to action.<br /><br />6. By stringing together a series of article-style chapters, the book ends up being a bit choppy to read and follow.<br /><br />I do recommend you read the book, and I hope that Mr. Gladwell will write a follow-up book that is prescriptive.<br /><br />Thank you for much food for thought, Mr. Gladwell!r.

031606792X|5.0|Great ending to a great saga...I highly recommend this saga to people of all ages.  I warn you though once you start you will not be able to put this story down.  I finished all four books in a month time frame.  Unfortuantely now I have to wait for the remaining movies to be made. Favorite saga of all time!!!
B000PC0U1W|4.0|Movie - 4.5    V for Vendetta strikes me as a well-scripted Chex Mix that serves as a superhero, revolutionary, and revenge movie all at once. But what makes the gunpowder treason and plot so interesting is the character of V himself and the circumstances in which his \\"quest\\" ultimately reveals a number of poignant observations. Aside from the obvious parallel between he and The Count of Monte Cristo, I particularly find the whole \\"rebellion against authority\\" theme to be a refreshing testament to the way certain governments can sometimes be a bit too controlling or ironically naïve for their own good, which in turn can cause said revolution. This is best portrayed through the character of Evey who, along with everyone else, had conformed and obeyed to the whims of a harsh and suffocating dictatorship for so long. And as history (or even science) has proven, for every action, there is indeed an equal and opposite reaction; authority <--> rebellion. But in one of the more unique twists, this revenge and rebellion is all catalyzed under the guise of a Guy Fawkes-masked vindicator whose actions also indeed can fit that of a textbook terrorist. 9/11 undertones are easily apparent when they mention the symbol of a building being destroyed and its ability to change the world for better or worse. I don't know when this graphic novel was written, but apparently the symbolism is justifiably and eerily accurate for what it's worth. I suppose it just depends on which side you're coming from and the amount of subjectivity involved when trying to observe such events. But in the end, I really enjoyed this movie for its extremely good choice in having cast Hugo Weaving as V and Natalie Portman as Evey. The only problems I had were a few pacing issues with the screenplay, that might've been better resolved with either a longer run time or more immersing musical score.    Video - 3.5    Presented in VC-1 with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio, I took a look at the bitrates (mostly in the highteens and low 20s) and it appears Warner Bros. used the exact same transfer from the previously released HD-DVD (aka the more inferior release). After reading the BD review of Batman Begins, I am now convinced that during the format war, some movies may have unexpectedly gotten the shaft in terms of a faithful transfer/encode. Because of the mere max capacity of 30GBs on a dual-layered HD-DVD, there wasn't as much space for as good a transfer/encode. The result: a few movies not quite meeting up to BD expectations LIKE a Batman Begins, V for Vendetta, and whatever else I might have in my library that was caught up in the war. Needless to say, while the BD presentation here is good, it's probably nowhere near as good as it could be. Colors are vivid, but not as in depth as I've seen in older, albeit newly-encoded, titles. Sharpness is around what you'd expect for an HD presentation, but some scenes looked a tad grainy and fuzzy (and not the good kind, like a Bourne Identity on BD, which by the way was re-encoded and looks great with the higher bitrates). Blacks aren't particularly deep either, which is a shame as it's a pretty dark movie. I'm disappointed, but it's better than DVD anyway...    Audio - 4.0    In addition, this TrueHD 5.1 track also seems to be a direct copy of the HD-DVD's. I don't have any HD-DVDs to compare, but I've heard other Warner Bros. titles with the same option, and they are remarkably more in depth than what we're given on this BD. Most of the film is dialogue and comes through very crisp (not that it should be hard), but the more action-focused scenes were lacking in surround usage. Music (one of the problems I had with the film overall) also seems less immersing than I'd like (where at least Batman Begins had a terrific score). LFEs were pretty good on a couple of scenes, though, such as the first fight where V introduces himself and that very cool montage with the dominoes. It's not quite up to snuff with other BDs having only an averagebitrate between 1.6 and 2.1Mbps, but it's better than regular Dolby Digital.    Extras - 3.5    I enjoyed the extras, which consist mostly of behind-the-scenes footage concerning production and writing, but I felt there weren't enough. The one segment making comparisons between V and a terrorist is especially interesting, though they could've offered a little more subjectivity to the ideas and overall concepts of what this could represent in society. All features are in SD.    Overall - 4.0    I really enjoyed this film for its unique twist on the superhero genre -- to essentially portray the hero as a terrorist. Much like its script (which is supremely enunciated by Hugo Weaving), the cast is excellent with a special commendation to John Hurt who basically just talks on a giant TV for most of the film. But regardless, the plot itself touches upon many subtleties about authority, self-will, the power of symbolism, and its ability to withstand the test of time, be it through censorship, controlled viewing, etc. I highly recommend this for the great story. But with only an average A/V transfer thanks to HD-DVD's inferiority and the laziness of Warner Bros. studios to do a proper re-encoding, we fans of V may have to wait for an eventual double dip, along with some of their other catalog titles.

B001GKYBXA|5.0|Paul McCartney has come out of comfort and created his best solo effort in a totally different sound than he's ever tried.  He finally let it loose and it flys.  This is his most exciting album ever as a former Beatle.  Hat's off to Youth for the production effort...it worked.  Just as Chaos Worked in a quiet mode, this goes left turn and away.  I love this album.  Every song creates it's own mood and they all work.  Fresh, non predictable, wonderful.<br />Track 7 \\"Sun IS Shining\\" is just amazing, a masterpiece!
1439102813|5.0|I have just finished this book and type this review with tears marking a path down my face. This book is a vivid and honest account of the disintegration of self, the unmaking of a person from the inside, out.     The heroine of this story is so imminently likable - genius but accessible, loving but flawed. The entirety of the book is spent rooting for her, even as you accept the inevitable outcome. This is not a book for those easily moved to despair. It may sound silly to type a disclaimer with regard to a book but I truly feel that this book has the ability to knock one's feet from under them.    It is heart-breaking.
B001GSV3EC|5.0|Intimate and very lucky audiences at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club were treated to a captivating and spellbinding series of concerts performed by Jeff Beck in London. The 2007 shows featured Beck's incredible eclecticism as he mastered jazz-fusion, blues and electronica fretboard genres. Poignant, ethereal and melancholic musical gems included \\"Were Were You\\", \\"Cause We've Ended As Lovers\\" and \\"Angel (Footsteps)\\". Beck's masterful, blistering and frenetic riffs highlighted \\"Beck's Bolero\\", \\"Scatterbrain\\", \\"Big Block\\" and the intricate \\"Brush With The Blues\\". Classics like \\"Led Boots\\" and \\"Nadia\\" further showcased Jeff Beck's nonpareil virtuosity. \\"A Day In The Life\\" was magically performed to perfection. Jeff Beck is simply the greated live concert guitarist on the planet. He does not even need a vocalist. His guitar talks, weeps, laments and roars.
