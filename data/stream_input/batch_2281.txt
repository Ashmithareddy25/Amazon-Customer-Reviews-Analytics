B004MYF4SS|5.0|The writing is of the highest quality marking a serious realistic craftsman. Strongly naturalistic yet with a deeply lyrical emotional depth. The research of the culture which the story explores brings the history of  a particular period of human life  and behavior, it's moral complexities and individual confusions, these the consequences of an imperfect system of justice and the human failure to comprehend the challenges of truthful accountability resulting from that imperfection, imperfection itself the result of our inability to put others before self,  gives the story it's enlightening substance. The novel falls into the police procedural crime genre. But it lifts the genre to a higher level, transcendent of itself. It asks the questions: What is a crime? Who is a criminal? How many characters in the novel commit crimes? How many are criminals? Thus crime/criminal -- these are metaphorical for all of us. The novel challenges our morality, our ability to live up to the moral values we claim to be our guiding values, and the imperfect justice system that is the result of our own imperfections.
B00BVDNKSY|5.0|I bought this originally when it came out on Steam and have invested many hours for this. I was waiting for this to finally make its way to Android, and now is the perfect time to snag it. Such a great game, great music, and a great time all around.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|great game,  useful time waster for appointments or waiting somewhere to pass the time.  Will be sure to keep this game on my Kindle Fire.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really love the story of this book. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a romance novel.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Excellent writing and acting.  Saw season 1 and 3 first.  Seeing them out of sequence did not diminish my enjoyment of Season 2. Well done!
6303114946|5.0|i had watched this movie several times years ago before my son was born.. now that he's 8 years old and has an interest in chess i thought it would be fun to watch.. except that it was really hard to find.. basically not available thru netflix and the local library, the next choice was amazon.com... the DVD versions were outrageously expensive so we opted for the VHS version for under $4.00..anyway, the movie was as enjoyable as before and the quality of the used VHS video was perfect.. if you have kids that are interested in chess this is a wonderful true story about an average kid with a very special talent.. enjoy.
B007EW9ISM|4.0|This stylus works but it just a tad too thick for my liking. This may depend on the size of your hands though but I generally prefer a bigger grip than that of a tiny pen-like stylus.
0812993292|5.0|This book grabs you from the very beginning and takes you with it on the journey.  I was so into it that I read it too fast, and I plan to re-read it so I can enjoy the best parts again.  I never do this, but this story really touched me.
B004SC8YB8|5.0|Have only played this about four times so far.  It's a runaway favorite !  I am sure I will buy more of Rory's work in time.  Never knew he existed until hearing his material through the online radio channel.  I like his carefree happy approach to music.  It was well protected in shipping and brand new as represented.

B008P9M614|4.0|Seasons 1 - 8 are still individually available on DVD.  However, only seasons 6 - 8 are available on BLU RAY.  If Universal Studios wanted to take this series to the pinnacle, this box set should have featured BLU RAY releases of all seasons.  Instead, devotees who had grown accustomed to the superior visuals and sounds on Blu are left to retrograde with Digital Versatile Discs...and kind of a creepy box.  UNIVERSAL STUDIOS: THE SERIES WAS/IS A HUGE HIT!  RATHER THAN GOING BACK TO 90S TECHNOLOGY, SPEND THE MONEY AND THE TIME TO REMASTER SEASONS 1 - 5 IN BLU!  WHEN FANS SEE THE BOX WITH THE BLU RING AT THE TOP, YOU WILL HAVE ADMINISTERED THE TLC THIS MASTERPIECE DESERVES.  NOT TO MENTION, YOU WILL HAVE ANOTHER BIG SELLER ON YOUR HANDS.  Alas, the series is over.  It's up to you to properly complete the legacy!
B0060D11OU|5.0|Good Life Lessons presented in a humorous way.<br />This is a must to share with children.  Great Movie to add to your Kindle Library!
B007N6NGYG|4.0|This train game turned out to be both enjoyable and challenging. It does sort of get a little hard to put down once you get the hang of it. This has the potential for hours (or days) of game play, especially if you are really competitive and would like to try and get a perfect score on each level. The new levels might cost a bit more to unlock, but I do understand the developer's need to generate extra revenue, but at the same time if I purchase this game, why should I have to pay more on top of that? It would be different if, like other developers, the actual game were free, but for unlocking and special attributes, you would have to purchase to obtain those. Otherwise, this is definitely a nice puzzle game. It brings challenge, but still has the ease of fun. Graphics are beautiful and fit the purpose perfectly. Only criticism is that the star rating for levels can be ambiguous. Most levels get 3* for completion, then 1 level is completed but earns 1* or 0*? It does get a tad confusing.
B0060CXBGM|5.0|Adaptation of a real life event. Inspiring!  Eskimos, Igloos and Ice, Ice, Ice.  Funny!<br />Due to language children should be at least 13 to watch.

0316228532|4.0|The beginning to this book was very slow paced, in my opinion, and I had a hard time keeping up with which characters were who for awhile. I almost gave up about 100 pages in, but then I was drawn in by the story and the characters. I'm not really into politics, so that part of the novel honestly didn't interest me. But the characters were extremely complicated - probably some of the most complicated, real fictional characters I've ever read about.<br /><br />This is not a happy novel. This is not a \\"happily ever after\\" story. This novel is about life - real, painful, beautiful life. It stirred many emotions in me, and made me uncomfortable at times. J.K. Rowling's writing is as powerful as ever.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Good guide. It's really helpfull. I can made my own e-book now. You shoud read it before you try made e-books alone.

FAOTD too!!<br />  Joe
B0025KVLSI|5.0|By late 1964, boosted by television, hype and frenetic mania, the Beatles were quickly becoming the biggest thing around. Being the epitome of commodities must take its toll and that strain seems to show on the slightly gloomy and weary cover of \\"Beatles For Sale.\\" Here an almost shell-shocked fab four stare at the viewer with nearly incredulous gazes. They even look a little accusatory, as if saying \\"we're more than the cute cuddly entertainers you think we are.\\" The contrast with the almost zany expressions on \\"Hard Day's Night\\" presents a startling juxtaposition. Though \\"With The Beatles,\\" from 1963, also featured staring and heavily shadowed faces, there they look more confident than weary. Not to mention the somewhat subversive title \\"Beatles For Sale,\\" which seems daringly sarcastic for 1964, especially for such an infinitely hyped money machine. Were they trying to say \\"this is what being a commodity does to you?\\" Perhaps they just wanted to tell people that they're growing up? Or, less dramatically, perhaps a series of coincidences merely came together to produce a suitably ambiguous cover? In any case, the effect resonates.<br /><br />Some of the music inside also shows a movement away from mop top happy love songs, with the exception of the giddy masterpiece \\"Eight Days A Week.\\" \\"I'm A Loser\\" and \\"Baby's In Black\\" could probably top a list of the Beatles' most lyrically morbid songs. Even \\"No Reply\\" paints a depressing and angry picture of painfully unrequited love, that, sadly, most of us have probably experienced firsthand. The words have begun to morph into slightly more edgy territory. This also parallels the growing musical experimentation. Here timpani, bongos and even an African drum appear. Though knowing the amazing and ground-breaking direction the band took just a few years later may retrospectively dilute the novelty of these early experiments, this was nonetheless crazy stuff for a 1964 pop band. The incongruous beginning of \\"What You're Doing\\" and the ominous booming chorus of \\"Every Little Thing\\" sound like nothing the band, or many others, had done before. Plus the gradual dominance of acoustic over electric guitars, which would come to full fruition on \\"Rubber Soul,\\" begins here. Only the energetically rocking cover songs really sound completely like the Beatles as the world knew them then. \\"I'll Follow The Sun,\\" one of the album's true masterpieces, may have even shocked listeners at the time with its musical sophistication and stark, gorgeous arrangement.<br /><br />Of course Americans would not have bought \\"Beatles For Sale\\" in 1964. The songs on this album, in true Capitol style, were sliced and diced across the mundanely titled \\"Beatles '65\\" and \\"Beatles VI,\\" neither of which featured the dour UK cover. Profits, as desired, ensued. This practice wouldn't cease until the concept album \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" in 1967. It very much obscured the band's burgeoning development on \\"Beatles For Sale.\\" Not until the 1980s CD releases would Americans, those without imports at least, get to experience the Beatles as their home country experienced them. The music was equally great in any case.<br /><br />Though many probably didn't see it then, \\"Beatles For Sale\\" begins the bold adventurousness that would mark the late Beatles' albums. They would venture into areas where pop music never went before and wisely quit before burning completely out. And they definitely remained for sale. And they sold.\\" and the ominous booming chorus of \\"Every Little Thing\\" sound like nothing the band, or many others, had done before.

B00APUQRPC|5.0|Would highly recommend this movie, watched it more than once which is rare. Good for all ages and genders. Liked all the actors.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This app has been so helpful. My kindle was having issues w/charging, &amp; I thought my battery might be shot. I was very happy to be able to find an app that checked the health of my battery. Once learnig that my battery was having issues, I was able to go to Amazon &amp; see if battery issues were a known problem w/the kindles. Found out that yes kindles tend to have battery &amp; charging issues. Fortunately my kindle was still under warranty &amp; Amazon sent me a brand new one no problem.
B00BB8UTEC|4.0|I enjoyed this movie more than most even though I knew going in it would be predictable.  Liked the actors and would recommend for women you want an interesting movie.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I bought Temple Run 2 as soon as it came out and it was fine until a few days ago. Now it shows the Imangi screen for about 10 seconds then closes. I reinstalled the game twice already and it works for a day or so then does it again. It also loses all of the features I have purchased on the game. Good game but really made me angry.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is good and I like playing it. You should get this game. It is great for kids and all.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I love watching Nathan Fillion in a show before Castle.  Firefly combines westerns and outer space in one show.  It has lighthearted moments as well as thrilling action.  It's a fun watch.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is awesome don't get me wrong, but it takes forever to load!!!!!! If it didn't glitch when it was going it would totally be 5 stars.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I have read virtually all of the Baldacci novels, and this is one of the very best.  It will keep you on the edge of your seat for all the twists and turns.  Robie and other characters will, I'm sure, be heard from again.  Highly recommended.
B002QUWYWE|5.0|Always loved this movie. As my 13 year old son said &#34;I'll never look at a pudgy, middle-aged, white woman the same way again!&#34; Great suspense!
B0071XO8RA|3.0|HYPE on this ebook in the newspapers.  I was so excited to read it based on reviews, hoping for another &#34;The Passage&#34; story. Yes, it's a good story but &#34;Wool&#34; does not come anywhere near the depth that Justin Cronin's book(s) have.  It was too<br />wordy(not adding to the story but detracting), too much going up and down spiral staircases, not enough input from book's characters who are so much more interesting than the author.  I don't like books written in 3rd person where you are not reading dialogue from the characters but the author is going on and on about what the character is thinking.  This is ok in a limited context but not when it overshadows the story which is a  good tale.  This would make a great movie as long as the author butts out and let the characters tell the story.  And yes, it's a great price.  I hope in the next book the author will let's us know all of what happened in the beginning to start the Silo communities (not enough on this detail ) and explain what happened with key characters at the end to make them act the way that they did.  Simply saying that one of them was a good man was not enough to override years of conditioning.
B004VFK5LO|5.0|Great twists & turns along with a who-done-it. Not to mention a very surprising performance by Harry Connick Jr. Great fun!
1611134900|2.0|I was very disappointed that the audio cd was an abridged version of the book.  We preordered the book and found that it lacked the normal Nicholas Sparks flare.  I would be willing to buy an unabridged version, but will never buy an abridged version of one of his books.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Good info for anyone thinking about the publishing options available. This guide tells you the how to create digital files from  the word program for Kindle Direct.
B00AYHKIZ6|3.0|Interesting that I could hear Bowie's heritage as a solo, british singer-songwriter like Joan Armatrading and Peter Gabriel: there is a peculiarly straightforward, what I would call, English Burlesque, a rattle bag of songs as his mood takes him, especially like Peter Gabriel's first two albums, difficult to make sense of as a coherent cultural statement, but you get flashes of memory, locations, people, moods, more a kind of articulation of an instinct about living in the twenty first century.  But very odd that the imagery and references stand out in many places for being quite mundane - almost get a sense of the Blues... Tombstones, God, Death, fate, the soul. The style influences are quite strong on this album, Supergrass, Bjork and the Sugarcubes in equal measure, and a nod to London colleagues Madness in places which made me smile. Great influences. For me, listening to The Next Day is like sampling and merging the contents of my music collection.  I think Supergrass do the same tempo and mood of rock with better lyrics,  and Bjork's older stuff seems to me to be more interesting all round.  What is so interesting is that Bowie breaths very like Bob Dylan in recent years, his emphasis in the phrasing is similar, possibly as they are a similar age.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Cool game if you liked Space Invaders back in the day. I love cheezy-graphic retro games and this one fits the bill nicely! Five stars!
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|A wonderful movie, funny as well as deep with meaning.  On a romantic dimension, it is a \\"beauty and the beast\\" type of story, where it takes the love of--and for--a woman to raise a man from his boorish former self.  For a review, I can do no better than to call attention to Jonah Goldberg's tribute to it in National Review:  [...]
1433502410|5.0|This book provides accurate and thoughtful information for the Bible students.  Many great authors contribute to the excellent work of this book.  They are rich in knowledge and understanding of the Bible.  I recommend this book to every Bible students.
0812993357|4.0|As someone who worked in the fashion industry as a writer/blogger for a few years I was excited that Grace Coddington wrote a memoir. I knew of her work but didn't fall in love with Grace until after watching \\"The September Issue.\\" \\"Grace\\" is an enlightening memoir that goes into her childhood, modeling career, her romantic relationships, and her styling career. There's no real structure to the book as the timeline meanders rather than going in a straight line so reading the book is probably best enjoyed a chapter at a time rather than trying to devour it all at once. Her drawings of people and animals are charming and I felt like I got to know Grace's personality. To echo some other reviews, the memoir is a collection of anecdotes and events but you don't really know her feelings about them. If you're looking for an in-depth portrait of Grace Coddington then this is not the book for you. If you're curious about Grace's life and insights in the fashion industry or looking for a gift for a fashionista, pick this up.
B006N9KFPC|5.0|One of the best albums on the market today. His voice surpasses all other male singers. Great for gifts and for you personally
044654759X|1.0|I orginally ordered this book my mistake, because I wanted a Kindle book.  So after I received the book, I returned it as suggested.  However, to my surprise, it was returned back to me.  I did not want the book so I emailed the vendor about returning it.  No response.  I emailed 2 more times and never received a response.  I do not know what is going on with this outfit but they are NOT customer friendly at all and I will not do business with them again.  Mike Jones
0060987464|5.0|I truly couldn't put it down.  It's beautifully written and makes you feel like you're right there.  That being said don't drink or eat while you read it.  It runs the gamut of emotions in as little as one paragraph and you don't know what's coming next.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Although I am just beginning this book, I have seen several interviews with Mrs. Sandberg and she offers many great insights for all women.

B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This game is one of the best games ever but I can't get more then 2 notes. He is everywhere. Super CREEPY!!!!!! If you like creepy things then get it. But if you are a chicken like me who can't even play the game without throwing my kindle on the floor and running, or screaming then do whatever you want........
B000A59PMO|5.0|I barely remember Veronica Mars being on TV.  I can only suspect that the marketing was either poor or not tailored towards me.  With the Kickstarter thing going on to fund a new movie for this show, I couldn't help but think maybe I was missing something...and I was right.  Like many good shows, it takes 2 or 3 episodes to really get in to it due to character developement, but man this show is like potato chips; you just can't stop watching.  Think Nancy Drew meets the Outsiders, or Nancy Drew on steroids.  Good acting and chemistry between the actors, and solid writing.  I'll reserve my judgement of where this series ends up on my top 100 list, but if the other 2 seasons are like the first, it will be a top 10 for sure.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|fun game. awesome graphics for a tablet game!<br /> keeps you interested. caution-it can be very addictive. I definitely recommend it!
B002SSUQFG|1.0|Alright...I have never had a negative review like this. I wanted to love this watch from the time I ordered it. I had searched for several months in stores and online and finally settled on the Seiko 5 for two reasons: the Seiko name usually means quality and I wanted a watch where the stem was at the 4 o'clock position.<br /><br />I wore the watch religiously, all day for several days because the watch does not have a battery (according to a battery store which I took it to). I noticed that when I put the watch on in the morning that the watch had stopped.  Not just once, several times this occurred.<br /><br />As I said, I wanted to love the watch, but I could not keep it because I just couldn't see resetting the time every morning.  The primary purpose of a watch is to keep time after all!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Its a great game but the characters are too expensive. Otherwise I love it. I am 11 yrs old and I love it, so its a awesome game for kids, maybe 8 and up. I hope this review  helps your choice of to buy it or not. Bye!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I have been using this mouse for about 2 weeks now, I decided to use it for a while before I wrote a review.<br />  I game mostly, with some internet browsing mixed in. So far this has been a really good mouse- very adjustable, a good amount of buttons, and most important, tracks very well. The software has to be DLed but it is nice and simple, works well. I have had MANY different mice over the years and this is just about as nice as any- especially for the price. The fit and feel of the mouse is good, and the looks are nice. It tracks very well, the software is easy to use and intuitive, and the mouse clicks are just right- not too hard or soft.<br /> You really can't go wrong on this purchase, unless the mouse is a little to big for your hands. I have large-extra large hands and I am a palmer, this mouse fits perfect, all the buttons are in easy reach for me.<br /><br />update: I have had this for 3 months and it has stopped working properly. When you go horizontally with the mouse, the cursor jumps up and down.I have to recommend a no buy at this time. Was pretty good while it worked.<br /><br />Update: Anker support is great, they had a new mouse to me in just a few days, THANK YOU!, with support this good I will definitely recommend this mouse. It is a very good mouse, after using it for 3 months, going back to my G9x kind of stunk.... I like the shape, layout, and overall play-ability of this mouse much more.<br /><br />update: had this mouse for a year now, and really like it. Still feels and looks.... and most importantly performs like new.

B00B1E6FF8|2.0|I gave this a solid hour before shutting it off to watch something else. Just too boring for me to stay interested. I think this movie was for the people out there that wander just what it is the Government does to protect our Country from foreign powers. I just didn't care enough to keep watching for more than an hour. All this Arab crap doesn't interest me at all.

0385344333|4.0|I always anticipate the new Jack Reacher novels. Was very disappointed that Hollywood chose Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher, as the character is supposed to be 6 ft. 3 or so and 240 pounds. Cruise is 5ft. 8 or something and about 165 lbs and definitely not an imposing fugure. But, I'll always like the Jack I imagine in the books.

030758836X|4.0|The Gone Girl is a page-turner thriller/mystery. Reading chapter after chapter and finding out something else as a surprise to do with the two main characters; husband and wife--Amy and Nick Dunne. They thought  that they were meant for each other, but find  out otherwise. All the characters are strong- the story is also strong to the reader. The story continues to have twist and turns as it goes along. No spoilers here--that would give away too much.<br />The only reason it got just 4 stars was because of the flaccid ending and overuse of bad language. But, that may be because the author was trying to make a point of the characters' personalities.
B00BEZTMWW|4.0|There's been a lot of criticism towards this movie; most of which springing forth from the fact that many feel it shouldn't be split into three films. I'm actually in the group who, before the film, felt like three films was ridiculous. After watch the first in Jackson's trilogy, I will grudgingly say I'm okay with it now.<br /><br />Here's where I'm coming from. The Hobbit, simply put, could not make three films on its own. Adding the elements from Tolkien's other works though, that makes for a way to increase time and, this is the part where I think many will disagree with me, will help pacing. Yeah, I know, I'll be the first to say that this movie feels too long (not interested in an extended edition this time, thank you. This would be fine by itself.) but the very nature of The Hobbit is a quest novel. There's a lot of traveling from place to place and getting into adventures along the way. The added benefit of the Necromancer plotline in the upcoming films, should actually make the pacing better. We'll have less jumping from moment to moment and more of a focus on two specific goals (Goal 1: the 14 going for the gold/Goal 2: the wizards fighting the necromancer) which can interact with each other. As of my writing this, neither of the later two Hobbit movies are out, so I'm just offering a hopeful note of possible way for the series to go.<br /><br />Onto the Blu-ray, the picture is wonderful, the special features are lighter than I would like, but more than I expected. Those of you waiting for the extended edition will no doubt see more when it arrives. The 3D is very good. This is the sort of 3D that doesn't pop out at you with gimmicks, but the sort that helps build the world by creating more depth. It's not the most impressive to look at, but it does add another visual layer to the film. (NOTE: the 3D version is split across two discs, so those of you not wanting to get out of your chair for an intermission may want to stick with the 2D.)<br /><br />All inall, I enjoyed The Hobbit. It has its faults, it's overlong, but it's enjoyable. I'm happy to revisit middle earth, and seeing my favorite of Tolkien's books come to the screen can't help but make me smile.
B00005V9HA|1.0|The Millenium Edition (from Elite Entertainment) takes the material from the previously released Anchor Bay DVD, and added other materials.... BUT none of the closed-captions or subtitles! I ordered it for myself but now I'll give it to one of my hearing Horror buff friends instead. I went ahead and found the Anchor Bay version which I CAN watch...
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game you can so much on this game but you just need to find it.play this game you will love it.
B007RP4D5Y|5.0|More cohesion than unity. What a marvelous pleasant surprise. Pat has matured to the point where he is one of the masters himself, to become a jazz icon in his own right. Congrats!!! For me as a fan, love the coolness refreshing rhythms and guitar sounds that these cd brings to my soulears. Well executed and mixed for the complex and simple chords of music heaven. Nice....
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Excellent from the science to the humour....i hope he can write a travel log for the rest of the planet's and moons ... enjoyed it all...thanks Andy
0679720200|5.0|Good quality. No pen marks whats so ever which is a good deal for five bucks. It looks just like a new book. Arrived rather quickly too. 5 STARS
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Once again HBO did a phenomenal job of condensing an entire book into 10 episodes. Sure there was stuff I missed from the novel (there always will be, in films and television adaptations), but I all my complaints would simply be nitpicking. This is hands down my favorite show on television. I can't get enough!
B005LCECU6|5.0|Very good early live album for Rush. Much of their early work has a raw energy that is missing from their new efforts. I love their new album's, but they are much more skilled and polished. If you love Rush, you'll love this album. The inclusion of a couple of previously unreleased tracks was fun to hear. I can see why they did not make it on a major release, but they are fun to hear nonetheless.
B00BGIBVRG|3.0|The movie itself was funny and entertaining, but the use of the &#34;F&#34; word was just too much for us. I did realize it was R rated, knew it would have stuff, just too much &#34;F&#34; word .. Even the kid goes on an F bomb tirade.<br />Good movie if that doesn't bother you, I just wanted you to know about the abundance of the language.
B00A1U2SVS|5.0|I have listened to this album at least a dozen times since I bought it. It feels very fresh. Its hard to believe these guys are pushing 70 (aside from Bonham of course). Jimmy Page's guitar work is many ways tighter and more groovy than on the original studio recordings of this material. The best part of all of this is that I got the MP3 album for $2.99 when it was on sale on Amazon's site.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Got hooked on this show after the pilot episode. Great plot and characters. Really gory though so if you have a weak stomach, this is not the show for you.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is awesome. Wow, it's incredible fun and it's lovely. It's good for all ages and I really recommend it!!
0451196716|3.0|the novellette was kind of a reprise of The Lottery, with a bit of cynicism thrown in. It had good moments, and some clunky ones as well. Not the first one i would grab to re-read, nor even in the top 100, but i am glad i re-read it, and probably will again in another 10 years or so.
B008KYOCA2|1.0|Way too difficult to figure out. Don't have an hour+ to try &amp; figure out a new app. Waste of time.
B00992CF6W|5.0|U should put all the things on xbox and computer on pocket edition but I still LOVE IT hope they come out with other good games
0446554995|5.0|I finished this in 2 days! Couldn't put it down. I was honestly upset when the book ended because it was just soooooo good. Lots of plot twists and you see a new side of Pendergast not in their other novels. The only regret I have is not reading this the very first day it came out. WONDERFUL!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Get it but it needs more updates I have It on my iPod and it has monkeys that the kindle didn't have
B004SIP7AS|2.0|This movie is just that- mediocre.<br /><br />The cast is passable, nothing extraordinary. Gwenyth Paltrow just doesn't have the personality right on Emma; She seems a sophisticated, rich snob with nothing to do but meddle with other peoples' affairs. She has no playfulness, and Paltrow alternates between being either too happy or too depressed, and always very selfish. I might add that her hairstlyes were awful, they made her look almost bald! Mr. Knightley is okay, but Jeremy Northam hasn't got the temperment or stature to play the character; it seems very difficult for him to act angery, it's almost laughable when he tries to reprimand Emma after insulting Ms. Bates. (and did anyone notice that Emma was almost taller then Knightley?) Frank Churchill has the goofiest hair style, whose idea was it to give him long hair?!? Ridiculous. He appears like a complete idiot, are we seriously suposed to believe Emma could ever fall for him?! Completely without charm, just dumb. Jane Fairfax is almost nonexistent, whatever you do see of her isn't pretty. Ms. Bates seems slightly insane. Harriet's interesting... a little too silly. None of the minor characters are worth mentioning.<br /><br />The sets seem cheap, the costumes are nothing special, the script is decent and stays relatively close to that in the book, but is not done justice by the actors.<br /><br />In my opinion, if you want a film that is closer to the book and has great acting, buy the A&E adaptation with Kate Beckinsale and Mark Strong. It is strong where this is weak, and is nearly perfect. Watching this \\"thing\\" sure makes me appreciate the A&E version.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's so cool I've always wanted a horse and know I sorta kinda have one !!!!!!!! Her name is Arebesque she is awesome !!!!
B006Z476J8|5.0|This Deluxe edition of Small Faces' classic 1968 album \\"Ogden's Not Gone Flake\\" is first of all a scoop because of the new remastered sound. Both the mono and the stereo versions sound great.<br /><br />CD 2 is a collection of alternate/early takes and a few outtakes; most of it fine stuff, but also slightly disappointing, considering that recordings and that would logical inclusions on the album are missing. For example the single version of Mad John, Wham Bam Thank You Mam and the single mix of \\"Afterglow\\". I also think it would have been great to have the songs released without the Stan Unwin narrative.<br /><br />A Small Faces boxset with previously unreleased rarities is according to some sources on the web in preparation, so one can still hope to get to hear Ogden's Nut Gone Flake without Stan Unwin. Granted, Unwin's story has a lot of charm, and it is clearly a big part of this album's character, but his narrative, in some cases over the music, may easily appear tedious and annoying.<br /><br />From earlier review:<br /><br />\\"Ogden's Nut Gone Flake\\" was the album that really established Small Faces as a band that wished to and should be taken seriously. Sadly the band had split up within a year of the album's release. A lot can be (and has been) said about the round tobacco box, I'll stick to giving a few comments about the music.<br /><br />The original two album sides were more or less two sections, where side one was a regular album, with outstandings songs like \\"Afterglow\\", \\"Song of a Baker\\" and \\"Lazy Sunday\\" - the three other tracks are just good.<br /><br />Side two is the experimental and ambitious side where the songs are tied together with a strange narration by comedian Stan Unwin. It's a fairytale story about Happiness Stan who goes looking for the other half of the moon.<br /><br />The songs are all great melodic tunes, with quite an impressive variation in style and instrumentation - several of them sung by bassist Ronnie Lane.
B00A4OALL0|3.0|I actually enjoyed about 4 tracks on this CD. Some of the tracks were too long. Found it difficult to get into.
B001HN6918|4.0|Too much violence for my taste, but not as bad as the movies out there for young boys. I will keep on buying Kung Fu Panda movies because I realize that that is what young boys want and it is okay, not extreme -- no blood.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|It's easy to get lost in this series.With the awesome character focus, you get to know, love and hate the characters.  The beauty of the abbey, grounds and costumes make this a must see.
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|it is a lot of fun but it resets itself. I had just gotten a new shark and ranked it up and left, when I came back it was all gone. back to square one!
B00BSW6F26|2.0|We point-and-click mystery gamers are getting desperate for a new,  GOOD game. This is not it! The game is FRUSTRATING,  and there are no hints. You basically have to tap all over to try and get the map pieces. As another reviewer said,  the items for inventory are not named,  and are hard to recognize. So,  you randomly try different ones in different areas. I even used a magnifying glass to try and figure out what a few items were.<br />Also,  it is a short game,  but you really don't realize it at first since you are trying to figure out things,  and you get totally frustrated. I do not understand why the developer has the website listed \\"if help is needed;\\" yet when you go to it,  it does not permit you to enter. So,  help is NOT available yet.<br />I did manage to finish the game (a miracle?) That is why I said it IS SHORT. I am very disappointed with this game,  since it has potential. It needs more work.<br />SPOILER ALERT: the map has to be finished before that box in the kitchen can be opened. The sequence is X,  triangle,  circle,  diamond. The steam in the bathroom gives the safe numbers in the mirror. You have to fix the water meter to get it to work. Hope this helps those stuck.<br />UPDATE FOR WENDY LEE: I purchased this, and played it through, in MARCH, BEFORE any walkthrough was available. Maybe YOU don't know how to operate your Kindle Fire.
B001I45UFC|5.0|Although technically a children's book, this is such a well written and charming story that adults would enjoy it also.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|The movie was pleasing enough but the dvd skipped in a couple places.  At one spot it kept skipping back a bit and replaying over and over.  Very frustrating.
B0035JRVBO|5.0|tom hanks is a top-notch actor.  the movie was great.  originally rented from youtube, but when power was lost due to a blizzard, they never got back to me about being able to finish the movie after the rental time frame.  see if you can guess where i'm NOT gonna rent movies now???
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey hooks you in so you automatically want to watch the next episode.  I can't wait for Season 4 to come out.  I'm hooked, hooked, hooked.
6304696566|5.0|I purchased this for viewing by my visiting young niece.  I loved every minute of The Searchers when 1st released,wondered at the mediocre ratngs given at the time and so pleased it has since been recognized for the wonderful film it is.  I recommend this movie to all, it is a part of our settler's history, is shot in beautiful Monument Valley with many wonderful performances!  It is unfortunate that some of the best movies ever made \\"back in the day\\" are not viewed by younger audiences inundated with current movies depicting so much violence and explicit sex.  Those old movies allowed one to use one's imagination!
B0069G5Z9K|1.0|Worst game ever it works but it sucks the only good thing about it is  that there's this spin token and if you get it you  can spin after you die.
B007N6NGYG|4.0|In this game, you start in the late 1800's during the rise of the industrial revolution.  Competing railroads have made a mess of the landscape, and you are tasked with bringing order to the chaos.  You need to switch and control the trains to ensure each arrives at its destination safely.  Railfans will love this game!<br /><br />The game requires lightning reflexes while playing, but patience and cautious study before starting the level.  You have to get the colored trains to their corresponding colored destination.  Timing becomes critical quickly - no pun intended.  The wise player will start to figure out the puzzle *before* pressing \\"Ready\\".<br /><br />The game features 4 \\"eras\\" currently, each with 24 levels, for a total of 96 levels.  Each era has its first level unlocked.  If 96 levels weren't enough, the developer is promising that 3 more ERAs are coming soon.<br /><br />The game utilizes a \\"Star\\" system - 3 stars for perfect solution.  Activating too many pads to complete the level docks stars.  The stars unlock locked levels.<br /><br />Think of this as a 3D \\"version\\" of Railyard; it is not exactly the same, but similar enough.  This one has a nice storyline, amazing graphics, deep stereo sound and very good music.  Obviously, a lot of thought and dedication went into this app.<br /><br />GOOD:<br />+ Good tutorials in the first \\"Industrial Era\\".  Instructions are not necessary as there's enough hand-holding to please almost everyone, yet enough latitude for the player to err and experiment.  By the time you have finished the 5th level, you'll be comfortable enough with the basic mechanics and are ready to play on your own.<br />+ Just the right amount of additional challenge added each level.  You will be challenged, not bored, and most people won't be too frustrated (kids might, however).<br />+ *WOW* the graphics, sounds, music, and more!  Attention to every little detail!<br /><br />BAD:<br />- Access to Amazon Billing Credit Card<br />- Landscape only; cannot play \\"upside down\\" (not that big a deal)<br />- You CANNOT earn \\"skip levels\\".

B009KEN87O|5.0|Picked this up as a fotd.  Well done.  I normally despise arcade-like games without a physical joystick controller, but this game managed to change my mind.<br /><br />The only thing that would have made this better is if it started out with the traditional &quot;Ready Player One&quot; opening screen.
B000FA675C|5.0|WHAT A GREAT STORY. YOU GET CAPTURED PRETTY QUICK AND IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO STOP READING. THIS BOOK WILL KEEP YOU ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|So addicting! I feel like my reflexes are getting better too!  I even got my husband hooked. I wish there were more settings but maybe in the next version.
B007XNAOPI|5.0|I love old Baroness, and when I heard that they said their next album would be different and more relaxed I was wondering what we were in for. It's great.  I don't know how to explain it, but its still heavy, but its got more groove than if ever imagine. The songs are well written and try transition well.
B009K916ZK|5.0|I needed an external dongle for my Macbook Air (Mid-2011) and decided to go with genuine Apple products this time. It worked perfectly.<br /><br />That being said, I tried a generic, aftermarket version, and it worked well too. Hard to say if it's worth the money. Only time will tell. But it still does exactly what it says.
B00A83075M|5.0|Loved the characters, the concept, and the animation. Gamers, novices, and those in between will enjoy this unique story. I loved the messages in the film and the way it promoted self reflection, adventure, risk taking, love, and friendship. I think all ages and both genders will like this movie immensely. It's focused around characters you can root for, with more intelligence and wit than an average kids film. The animation is impeccable. I can't wait to watch this one gain and again. A really wholesome and fun movie all the way around. A new classic!
0763621803|5.0|My daughter was on a food strike when we bought this and it certainly peaked her interest. Later that day she asked for a carrot. A fun book no matter whether your child is picky or not!

B008K8X0IS|5.0|I am so glad I bought this. My husband and I are big fans and this has all the extras you could want. The dragon egg paperweight is really cute and the map of Westeros helps visualize where all the action is taking place. I hope a collector's edition comes out for season 2.

B0078ZTWP4|4.0|I have a Rayovac Sportsman Lantern and love it a lot after a few power outages. So I bought this lantern considering they look almost identical and much cheaper than Rayovac Sportsman Lantern. It was a pleasant surprise once I received and tested the lantern. Its low level setting is already as bright as the Rayovac Sportsman Lantern, the high level is of course much brighter. I like it a lot. However, the build quality is not as good. One of the metal conductive piece on the bottom lid fell off when I received the product. I had to use super glue to fix that, hence the 4 star rating.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This 2005 adaptation of Jane Austen's novel was beautifully portrayed and characterized by a fine British cast; I highly recommend this film for the whole family.<br /><br />Loved Keira Knightly, whom I have seen in a few films, and thought her portrayal of Elizabeth Bennett was magnificent, with a touch of today's young, knows-her-own-mind, woman.  As for Matthew Macfayden (Mr. Darcey), whom I have never seen in film, was the dashing, brooding, romantic figure of a young girl's dream.  I much preferred his Mr. Darcey, to Colin Firth's.<br /><br />The music, piano solo, is especially a dream for the ears and the cinematography is breathtaking!<br /><br />In short, I loved this film which has made a Jane Austen fan out of me.
B003WUYRGI|2.0|It is a very long book. AND I love books<br />It was bad and boring.<br />Very boring.<br />Moo in a British ascent?<br />Lol

B00AR1G3FS|5.0|Have always liked The Eagles. Have never had a chance to see a live concert, which are hideously expensive. This DVD is like sitting in the $500 seats
1612680011|4.0|I really like the style of the book having the author giving examples of opposite pieces of advice received from both fathers, as well as lining those to how (little) successful the parents were.<br /><br />I think is a good read with many good points, and can be a real eye opener.
0385349947|5.0|Lean In will become a 'must have' for female executives and entrepreneurs. As a Director in Technology at a Big4 consulting firm, I am often the only woman in the room at my level, and it shouldn't be like that.<br /><br />Most firms, including mine, have a WIT (Women in Technology) group who's purpose it is to attract women into our field and then support them as they grow. We did a study that showed slightly more than half of the entry level associates are women, but that number decreases as you move up the ranks, and then there is a virtual cliff at the Director and Partner level. Books like this can help smooth out that cliff, not just by giving women a book to read that motivates them, but also for men who should, as the book says, consider it a badge of honor to be the sponsor for a female moving up the jungle gym.<br /><br />The best part of this book was the discussion regarding mentorship. It should not be the modern day version of seeking Prince Charming. As a mentor, it can be overwhelming when so many people you don't know well ask you to mentor them, and it can also be overwhelming when your ment-ee has a greater time expectation from you than you are ready to give. Both the mentor and ment-ee should get something out of the relationship - as Sheryl said, if you need to spend an hour a week talking to someone, get a therapist.<br /><br />Again, a great read for both women AND men.
1589795474|3.0|I was curious about this book  and I must say the start it is quite interesting, however it comes to a point where so many statistics, somehow meaningless, became too much... too much date but not enough information or useful analysis
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|I have looked before in the past and found that a Bluray was never made. When looking around for other Blurays to buy I stumbled  on the pre-order listing that was to be shipped in March 2013. I went ahead and bought it and around mid March, this baby shows up on my door steps. All time great movie produced and directed by Ron Howard and George Lucas. This was filmed in the era where CG technology was still in development. This makes the movie awesome because it makes you respect the amount of  real acting, fight sequences, backgrounds and other movie stuff that are now a days just CG. Great and talented cast and crew! Lots of extras on the Bluray now. I had this movie on dvd and it only had commentary with Warwick Davis and a little behind the scenes.  Buy it!!

B00B2TTVNU|5.0|I first became acquainted with Ms. Lisitsa's playing on a CD I obtained of Liszt from a second hand store several years ago. The CD was advertised as \\"unedited\\" so naturally I was curious. The playing blew me away, among the repertoire, Paganini Etudes and the 12th Hungarian Rhapsody among others. When I stumbled upon a second CD, I snatched that up as well. Then I obtained her DVD of Chopin etudes which were, simply, astonishing. I then looked her up on YouTube and saw she had posted much difficult repertoire on there of which I sampled, among others, her astonishing rendition of the Hammerklavier. I finally wrote to her and asked her why she was not on a major label; she answered, she didn't know why either and if I could put in a good word for her possibly with some of them.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I don't have that kind of juice, so I thought nothing more about it but continued to listen to her various YouTube postings. I also heard her perform the Rachmaninov 4th concerto on the radio from Chicago which was fabulous. When I finally saw she had landed a Decca recording contract, I watched her live recital on the net of the recorded event.<br /><br />I specialize in collecting recordings of the Rachmaninov concerti, so, naturally, when she came out with an mp3 of the 2nd and 3rd I snatched them up. Likewise with her recording of the 4th. I then decided to buy the complete set on CD as soon as it came out. Of course, I was not only blown away by her performances, but not surprised that they were so great!<br /><br />But Lisitsa is no empty-headed virtuoso with only fingers; she is a thoughtful, dedicated and thoroughly enticing musician! She plays the 4 concerti and Paganini Rhapsody with incredibly varied styles, treating each work as an individual entity in its own right. Briefly, the 1st concerto is played like gangbusters, all out, virtuosic, impetuous with all the innocent virtuosic vitality of youth; the 2nd concerto is more integrated with orchestra, showing Rachmaninoff's greater maturity; the 3rd is mysterious and dreamy; the 4th is ironic and playful; and the Paganini Rhapsody is tempestuous and passionate! In short, one of the best sets of the complete concerti since Earl Wild's set for Reader's Digest in the 1960s! The orchestra playing is marvelous too and well integrated with the soloist. BUY THIS SET! YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED! Bravo Valentina!

B007PT3QOQ|3.0|this game is super fun. the problem is they force you to spend all your money in the tutorial and then when you are addicted you find out you can't do S***T without spamming your friends on fb or actually buying things wit real money. also run out of energy all the tucking time.
0470901071|5.0|This book is excellent and uses the occasional joke or anecdote to help yo get through what is a very dry topic. I say a must have because it definitely appears to cover all the necessary detail. And I say but as I don't think this on it's own will get you your CCNA certification. I would consider other resource or a study group on top of this is the approach that I am taking.

0425252868|4.0|This book is a great read, and the story of an act of chivalry in the midst of the horror of WWII is very moving. The writing is not the best, but the story carries the day.<br />However, after finishing the book and thinking about the events described, I have some thoughts I'd like to share and see if anyone has any comments. Please don't interpret any of this as a criticism of Franz Stiglers actions, I'm just looking at the story from different perspectives.<br /><br />First, after the story becomes public, Franz Stigler starts to receive nasty phone calls at his home in Canada. Some of these calls are from Canadians, and are along the lines of 'go home Nazi'. Others are from Germans, accusing him of being a traitor. Franz tries to calm his wife by explaining that the German callers may have suffered during the bombing of Germany by B-17s, maybe even lost loved ones. While at first I was appalled by these phone calls, I wondered if they were justified (from their perspective) in calling him a traitor. Consider this: your country is being bombed by the enemy, your cities are being reduced to rubble and thousands of civilians are dying. At times you look up at the sky and as far as you can see there are enemy bombers. Imagine what it must feel like seeing 500 or 1000 bombers dropping their payloads. Imagine the terror. Then you hear of a fighter pilot that gave one of those bombers safe escort past your anti-aircraft gunners. It's not hard to understand how these people feel, even so many years after the fact. What if the situation were reversed, and they United States was being bombed by the German air force, and one of our fighters did the same thing? Would we still look at him as a valiant hero?<br /><br />Second, throughout the book the German fighter pilots are portrayed as men of honor and dignity who are disgusted by what Hitler and his cronies have done to Germany - the elimination of Democracy, the hatred, etc. They fight for Germany, not for Hitler, and they follow their own code of honor, at times refusing to follow orders from Berlin that go against that code. Most of this takes place towards the end of the war, when it is slowly becoming apparent that the tide is reversing and Germany is going to lose. This strikes me as a bit of a whitewash of history. I wonder how those pilots felt at the beginning of the war, when it seemed as though the German war machine was unstoppable and world domination did not seem such a far-fetched idea. Time may indeed have made them see Hitler and his crazy ambitions more clearly, but I suspect that in the beginning they were likely fully on board with the agenda. I just find it hard to swallow whole the picture that this book paints of the German pilots. Whoever is providing the material is obviously and understandably heavily invested in making sure that the pilots are made to look as disconnected as possible from the Nazi agenda.<br /><br />Again, I do not mean to detract in any way from the essence of this story. It is a very moving tale of how in the middle of a brutal war men strive to preserve their humanity and cope with the awful reality of what they are being called upon to do every day - risk their own lives while taking others.

B00026WU7I|5.0|To me Blood on The Tracks is one of Bob Dylan's best love and passions of the heart albums.<br />It is meticulous in sound - meaning his diction and the exactness of the notes of his guitar. The arrangements of all of the songs are truly coming from a serious human genius platform~ reaching other human genius' and kids' alike. Wordsmithing at it's finest with melodies to die for. I am in awe of it, actually. Learn something new each time I listen.

B00AHTYGRW|5.0|I remember when the Americans being  held hostage in Iran was the major news story in the U.S. ,so I looked forward to seeing how well this time would be portrayed thirty years later. Although the director and writer apparently took  some creative license with a few of the actual events,they brilliantly recreated the important elements and effectively captured the mood of that stressful time. I've watched the movie three times and will gladly watch it again. Not only is the story engrossing,but I appreciate more with each viewing how skillfully the movie was directed. I love this movie!
B00BEZTMWW|2.0|Ultra Violet and Flixter are not Mac users friend. This little deal WB has with Ultra Violet is garbage. If you want your Digital Copy in i Tunes your SOL.

There is an expiration on your content after three years \\"poof\\" no more content. I contacted Ultra Violets customer service VIA E-Mail to voice my complaint.

B00AEFXN46|5.0|What a stunningly sweet transfer. Chinatown has been one of my favorite films since seeing it as a kid with my old man when it came out, and after watching it a dozen times over the years last night's viewing on blu-ray was like seeing it in the theater for the first time. The picture is almost grainless and looks like it was shot today. The colors are gorgeous and the anamorphic widescreen is letterboxed as it should be, with Polanski's superb compositional skill highlighted to grand effect.<br /><br />This is what all blu-rays should look like. Add over an hour of excellent interviews with Jack, Robert Towne, Bob Evans and Roman and you've got a true gift for any fan of this fabulous flick, and there's lots of us. I love the best noirs as much as anything Hollywood ever did, and this is as good as the Maltese Falcon and Double Indemnity to my eyes and ears, and those are two of the finest films ever made. Everything here is tight and right: the script, the acting, the pacing, the byzantine plot, the not-too-subtle truths about government and police corruption, and the overall effect. It's pure noir in all the best ways, especially its willingness to tell the truths we never like hearing about how we let our society be run by the greediest and most ruthlessly immoral people.<br /><br />And Goldmsith's magnificent score never sounded better. The sound remaster is excellent and the dymamic range is as it should be, loud but never forcing you to jump for the remote during the loud bits. The extras state that the original score was dumped after early screenings, and JG was asked to do this in a hurry. He scored the whole picture in nine days! Now that's genius, as this is one of the finest atmospheric scores you'll ever hear, on par with Herrmann and Morricone at their best, and that's perfection.<br /><br />Chinatown is about as good as Hollywood ever got, and this blu-ray highlights that fact in all the best ways. This is easily one of the must-have blus for any serious film fan, as it shows how near perfection this medium can get when matched with a high def big screen and good sound system.<br /><br />Cheers to Polanski, Nicholson, Dunaway, Goldsmith and Towne for reaching the height of their artform. Turn out the lights, crank it up, and prepare to experience movie magic without compromise.ous film fan, as it shows how near perfection this medium can get when matched with a high def big screen and good sound system.<br /><br />Cheers to Polanski, Nicholson, Dunaway, Goldsmith and Towne for reaching the height of their artform.

I bought it to see the beautiful Wyeth prints that intrigued me as a boy and I bought the book for my grandchildren. With TV and all the electronic geer available to them, I'm skeptical if they'll take the time to immerse themselves in the stories - which are sadly dated.

1400076943|5.0|Purple Hibiscus, like Chimamanda Adiche's other works, is a stunning achievement which transcends the boundaries of what many consider African literature but still manages to maintain its African heritage.  There is no pandering to outside influences telling Adiche what she can and cannot write about as an African writer in this novel.  It gives a brutally honest telling of not just Nigerian life but all life.  The main character Kambili's struggles with her father's oppressive smothering and control of every aspect of her life reveals insights and emotions which apply across the spectrum, regardless of where you may come from.  It would be a disservice to the accomplishments of this novel to say anything about it is uniquely African, because everything about this novel is uniquely human. Yes, there are values related in the story, aspects of the setting, and conflicts in the novel which pay full credit to their origin, but Adiche manages to weave these details into a story about the inner turmoil we all face when presented with realities which derail our preconceived notions.<br /><br />Kambili and her brother Jaja are thrown into a completely different world from the one they know, the world of rigid schedules, a strangling desire to please their pious yet abusive father, and a single inflexible perspective on life that relegates anyone who dares to oppose it as hopelessly inferior.  Upon spending a week with their easy going, poorer but happier cousins, the nontraditional household shakes the foundations of their worlds to the core, stirring a rebelliousness in Jaja as much against the monocultural domination of his father as it is against his abusiveness. Kambili struggles to break the shakles of her upbringing, however, and is vied with as much misperception and scorn by her same aged cousin Amaka as her father views his own traditionalist grandfather.<br /><br />This novel is very much based in the idea of deconstructing the single-story which Adiche has lectured about famously in her TED-talk. It is about Kambili deconstructing the view that her father has forced into her that his way is the only way, that heathens should be prayed for but not interacted with, that to be worthy as a human being means being the best in class, and that a father's love is best felt through the absence of a beating.  It is about Amaka deconstructing her notions of Nigeria's rich as haughty, exploitative, and hedonistic. And it is also about us as readers, and even more as people, deconstructing the view that African's are either the barbarians of Conrad, the uncivilized tribes of our history classes, or the helpless victims of movies and news media.  Adiche's writing, beyond the elegant descriptions or poignant contextual backdrops, is worth reading most of all for the way she captures our most personally challenging emotions, thoughts, an conflicts through characters we are not used to relating to, and forces us to drop our preconceptions and connect with them on a beautifully human level.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this novel and all of Adiche's other works, particularly The Thing Around Your Neck. I would also urge anyone who has not to watch her TED-Talk, which was genuinely enlightening as well as entertaining.  Adiche's works are the prime example of contemporary literature being able to positively influence not just our understanding of a particular topic, but the way in which we view and interact with the rest of the world.

Graham divides the investing audience into two main categories, the defensive and aggressive; and has advice for both kind of investors.<br /><br />I was initially skeptical, if a text written in 1974, would be able to help me understand present day markets, but each chapter from the original textbook, is complemented with an additional chapter explaining how Graham's principles apply to present day markets.

I hope you read this gifted author, who continually strives to entertain readers in an exciting and professional way.<br />While reading this exiting journey written by this very talented writer, I could relate to feeling consciousness slipping away and feeling as if I was falling asleep in the air with the wind at my back while gazing at the sky.  I wondered if I was dreaming or perhaps dead. However, I didn't land in a massive pile of leaves and wake up. I landed in Heaven for which I wrote my near-death experience \\"I Saw the Light\\".<br />I loved the dialogue in this novel and the vivid descriptions. I could see myself as a college freshman looking out from my window and seeing the main entrance to the school and the historic oak tree. As I read, I felt more fondness for the author, as I know how hard it is to write a composition that we hope readers will embrace and savor.  I found \\"The First Pillar\\" to be a pleasurable and delightful read.

B0059XTU1S|2.0|This is barely The Hobbit. It's essentially The Lord of the Rings: The Prequel. Director Jackson's instincts, comparatively on the mark in the LotR trilogy (particularly in The Fellowship of the Ring), seem to have deserted him here.<br /><br />While in some respects the prototype for the later Lord, The Hobbit was a far more intimate, careful creation -- an epic but also a novel -- and the movie deserved its own distinctive vibe, its own pacing, its own production design.<br /><br />But it's been treated as a second-rate Lord of the Rings mash-up. Jackson has simply pushed The Hobbit down into the LotR mold, trimmed off the parts that over-ran the borders and added new LotR-style material where Tolkien did not supply it. (Hence, the Giant Combat Scenes and the Powerful Nemesis and the omission of any useful sense of the delights of Bag End.)<br /><br />Indeed, there's so much extraneous material that the story (originally as straightforward as can be) occasionally gets a bit lost. For instance, in the central section a fair chunk of time is invested in the wizard Radagast, but to no useful purpose beyond seeming inspiration for a \\"Return of the Jedi\\" speeder bike-type sequence in the inevitable video games.<br /><br />And Radagast has company. Jackson has needlessly freighted his movie with characters who never appeared in The Hobbit and one of the results is that, with less screen time (and few closeups), the core cast is harder to identify. If you're making a story with 13 dwarves, this is something at which you need to work assiduously. They should not be largely interchangeable -- and they are. (At the same time, a number of the dwarves barely seem like dwarves at all. Thorin Oakenshield in particular has been 'Aragorned' and wears a single disdainful look on his face throughout.)<br /><br />The director also hasn't edited himself tightly -- this theatrical edition runs an exhausting two hours and forty minutes -- and this is his first Tolkien movie to try my patience at a basic level.<br /><br />And even in the most basic terms, Jackson hasn't even made what I'd call a technically good movie. There's something distinctly and consistently \\"off\\" here. Too much of this feels as though it wasn't fully thought through -- as though Jackson didn't have time or inspiration or handed off critical issues of continuity and style to ADs or production assistants. But The Hobbit has none of the organic flow of the the LotR films, it's notably lacking in the artful audio-visual signposts that helped guide us through the trilogy and certain scenes are just botched. For instance, the one in which young Bilbo passes out under the pressure of too many uninvited guests is downright incompetent -- not well-acted or sweetly sad and certainly not funny. It plays as though Freeman either missed his cue or Jackson simply didn't have time to labor over the result. Similarly, Gandalf's appearance outside the hobbit hole's door and the trolls sequence, both so memorable in print, come across oddly half-baked in the reinvented versions here.<br /><br />And it's all just so uneventful! Even the climax seems trivial and underdone (and oddly overdone at the same time) and at one point I found myself almost laughing. I could point to the miscasting of Freeman in the title role -- even Elijah had greater gravity -- or the absence of the rich sense of foreboding that was so much a part of the novel or the issues some allege with the high frame rate, but I suspect it's a deeper issue: the pressure to turn this unitary tale into a trilogy and the resultant overtaxing of the source material. (A far more sensible scheme was laid out by the director back in the '90s, when he saw The Hobbit by itself as the first film in a trilogy with LotR filling in the last two slots.)<br /><br />This didn't need to be three movies. There was enough material there for one great one ... and that opportunity just passed us by.atience at a basic level.<br /><br />And even in the most basic terms, Jackson hasn't even made what I'd call a technically good movie.

The game is a great way for kids to pass the time and they can really have a great time playing it. I know my nephew has a great time playing it on my Kindle HD 8.9. Makes him think and he likes the challenge. Hope you guys can enjoy this game just as much as he did.<br /><br />I gave this game 5 stars because my nephew had a great time playing it and now it's one of  his favorites. If my nephew enjoys a game it's a winner in my book.<br /><br />I suggest this game to anyone that has kids, or anyone that like puzzle game. Even if you just like trains you will enjoy this game. Thanks for reading and have a great one.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I received this free as part of my purchase, but I like it for travel. It's big enough to hold more than I need to take, and is well-padded enough to protect my equipment during general use. It's bigger than my usual bag, so I wouldn't take it out for a day of sightseeing- I'd take my smaller bag for extended carrying.

B0001CNRBG|4.0|...as George so often says. :-) \\"Same Time, Next Year\\" is, however, a story very well thought through; brilliantly played and never boring, despite the fact that there are only two people acting.    It is interesting to see the different focus points in a couple relationship unravelling between Doris and George during the span of 25 years: considering that the theatre play it is based upon was written in the Seventies, it is well observed. In the Fifties, when Doris and George first meet, marriage was first and foremost meant to give you a status in life and to breed children, and man's and woman's lives were quite clearly separated from one another; but during and after the sexual revolution more and more people understood how many vital elements can be touched between a man and a woman, and this is what the story is all about. The largely believed illusion that it is precisely the estrangement - the fact that man and woman can never understand one another - which triggers sexual interest and desire, is being dismantled here again and again.    While they don't do this in the relationships with their relative spouses, Doris and George always talk about the things that are important to them with one another, even when it comes to very difficult subjects; and this does not abate the flames of passion between them, on the contrary, the mental intimacy makes them desire one another even more. They break much more than the taboo of infidelity - they constantly step over the boundaries of intimacy that seemed so insurmountable between the sexes at the time that the film begins. At one time, George must help Doris deliver her fourth child (when the play was written, it became gradually the fashion for men to assist their wives during childbirth, while before it was usually a purely female affair). Yet the experience is degrading for neither - Doris later even refers to it as \\"our finest hour\\". At another time, Doris helps George to finally accept his grief about his son'sdeath, which he hadn't managed during the whole year before he met her again.  As times develop and years pass, Doris and George live their everyday's lives with their spouses, but they do need one another for personal and mental development. Their marriages remain unburdened by the extra burden of their growing selves, but also devoid of the sparkle of adventure: while again and again, Doris and George literally discover one another, meeting again year after year not knowing who the other is respectively has become in the meantime.    This story depicts quite clearly how difficult and all-encompassing a couple relationship is: Doris and George like their arrangement because it helps them to split up their needs between two different partners, and everyone who ever was in a relationship knows how difficult it can be to bring and keep everything together - everyday's life, emotional and mental development, sexuality, good times and bad times.    If anything is illogical about \\"Same Time, Next Year\\", it is precisely the interval at which the two protagonists meet, never having the slightest contact with one another in the meantime. I find it very difficult to believe that, even if you are married to someone else and have to conceal your affair, you would not desperately want to see or at least to hear from the other for a whole year if you are in love. But then, this is only fiction. :-)
B00AB2NYNC|5.0|I absolutely love Mumford and Sons. I managed to stumble across the Red Rocks concert on HBO so I had to purchase the albums immediately.I'd recommend this one instead of buying Babel cd and Sign No More separately(that's what I did). I prefer the live versions of the songs so an audio recording is pretty sweet deal. The dvd has a few songs that weren't in the HBO version, which is a really nice surprise. I highly recommend this for anyone (I normally listen to hard rock and metal but I've been playing Mumford and Sons nonstop for almost 3 months). Marcus has an amazing voice, I'd like to meet him one day (totally off topic, I know). The casing I think should of been a little different, the CD's that are on the front and back are a little stubborn to come out and I noticed a few scratches. But I do like all pictures that was incorporated into the packet, pretty fancy compared to the normal plastic cases.
B0046B4VXQ|4.0|I saw this film about twenty-five years ago and at the time, most of all I was shocked by its coldness and brutality. Watching it again - though only partly - after all of this time, I had a different and quite interesting reaction.    If \\"Carrie\\" says anything to me today, it is how useless it is to expect other people to change. If you are a rather sensitive, introverted person and do not have the possibility to dress up or to behave in a manner that would make you popular (even if you maybe don't really care for popularity and would be glad to simply be left in peace), you will probably wind up being mobbed, ostracized, bashed in most any group.  And people WON'T change their minds about you. Ever. The tide will not turn; you will not turn from zero to hero, find that you are like everybody else or better, that you are beautiful, and your high school crush will not at once develop an interest in you - at best he will take pity on you. Stephen King's novel is, you may say, an extremely bitter interpretation both of the Cinderella theme and of the American Dream. The protagonist suddenly finds herself good-looking, successful, popular, loved; but it's only a soap bubble destined to be crushed in the cruellest way. She will only be humiliated again, and worse than before.    \\"Carrie\\" throws a light on what cruelty and violence really mean - a \\"good and evil\\" interpretation as disturbing as the Jekyll & Hyde theme, if not more, saying one thing clearly: what everybody depends upon is POWER. No matter how much you may hate someone, you will not harm them unless you have the power to do so. How many of us seem virtuous, forgiving people but are truly not so, only never harmed anyone because they simply hadn't the chance to? That Carrie discovers her psychic abilities with such rapidity and intensity is, of course, only a dramaturgical trick: but it makes you ask yourself whether you would not have done the same in her place. Along with that thought comes the same question about all of the uncountable, horrifying crimes that happen all over the world; how often do they happen not (or not only) because someone is insane or particularly mean, but simply because he or she has the power to do it? Does this raging, hideous violence not reside, more or less hidden, in any of us, and perhaps even more so in those who seem to be so harmless and meek, but are secretly full of hatred on account of having been abused and downtrodden for ages?    It is nearly impossible to judge Carrie, even less to condemn her even though she eventually kills hundreds of people; her story casts a gruesome light upon responsibility, and upon how the moral failure of only one person (I mean Chris, not Carrie) can be disastrous for everybody involved, even the well-meaning ones. It also shows how immaturity and superficiality are never abated; who is narrow-minded and silly will remain so, it is no use to wait for anyone to change his attitude. Carrie is a person who was imprisoned all of her life; but Chris' seemingly boundless freedom does not make her a better human being, on the contrary, it makes her think only of herself at other people's expense. Everything, so \\"Carrie\\" seems to say, has a negative aspect to it, even free will.  It is also strange to see and think about how almost every group seems to need a scapegoat, in order to pour one's own unwanted weaknesses on him or her and not have to think about them ever again. \\"Winners\\" do not really exist; they need \\"losers\\" precisely in order to feel as such. Once someone is in hell, so \\"Carrie\\" relentlessly tells us, he will stay there all of his life - and beyond.    Carrie's mother's attitude towards \\"religion\\" is more than questionable: she and her daughter are never seen to go to church, they do not follow any Christian regulations, do not perpetrate useful social work or anything of that kind. \\"Religion\\" merely is an excuse for Margaret to make her daughter afraid of her so she can use her as a wastebin for her boundless self-hatred. Even the cross in the closet Carrie is shut in shows not Christ but a horrifying, grotesquely disfigured St. Sebastian, already preparing the way Margaret dies eventually - shot by arrow-like knives. Nothing clearer than this shows that Margaret is not in the least religious but has born and raised her daughter to believe that she herself is God. Carrie at last proves to her that she is much more powerful than she, but paying a terrible price. Again, we ask ourselves: did she ever have a choice?    Although - the change. Yes. Of course. Carrie's story also tells us what can eventually change - yourself. If you find some kind of power inside of yourself, you may leave abusive places and people behind, build up your own life and let go of the past. But if you are trapped, the way Carrie is, in a destructive love-hate relationship e.g. with an abusive parent, you are doomed. You do not need any psychic or other supernatural powers for that: you will change anyway, like become permanently mentally or psychically ill, or perhaps choose suicide. If you grow up in an abusive environment, all that remains for you is escape - either by dreaming and hoping, or by leaving everything behind and starting anew, or by utter and explosive violence.    As criticism, I want to add that I do not believe in telekinesis, most assuredly not to this extent. I also wondered how a girl's monthly period is supposed to begin so late in her life, and then so suddenly and intensely; being a woman myself, I did not find it realistic. But I guess that it is precisely the combination of the supernatural with seemingly flat, everyday places, persons and situations that makes this story so disturbing, because you can't help wondering whether something like this may not perhaps really happen.  Whoever wonders about young people going amok on school camps should in my opinion not study dozens of heavy tomes on psychology; watching this film is more than enough. Thefirst step is the power you may discover, but the second step is the chance to choose. A kind, seemingly loving interest from someone she has a crush upon makes a girl blossom here; cruel mockery bring upon rage and destruction.    As usual with Stephen King, there is no warmth in this story, no heart at all; the only emotions exist in dreams, provided someone has the courage to dream and to hope that dreams can come true. However, I was a little surprised by myself: I usually do not care much for horror books or films, and I did not expect to find so much food for thought here. Seen like this, there is much more depth in \\"Carrie\\" than one would want or expect to find. Although he is generally known as a master of horror entertainment, one must admit that Stephen King is a psychological genius in his own way.

B00B1E6FF8|2.0|I fell asleep several times during this movie.  It kept running the same story line time after time.  Whoever made this a highly rated movie?  It may have taken ten years to get Usama but did they have to make it seem like ten years in the movie.  Even the raid on his living quarters was dark, hard to see and uneventful.  It was like \\"so what\\".  Did not like the movie and it had nothing with the torture scenes although they were draw out much to long and it did not add anything to the movie because no intelligence was gained from the torture.

0984334904|5.0|I didn't exactly know that my daughter needed hiragana first, and she recommends that you learn hiragana first before learning kanji. The box set comes with a hiragana chart and a katakana card, so I guess that she could be learning hiragana at the same time, but I still recommend getting hiragana first, and even katakana before that. Overall, these are great cards!

B00742GBDM|3.0|Jane Austen's novel \\"Mansfield Park\\" emphasizes the interplay of character, with some criticism of \\"society\\" along the way. Adapting this for the screen requires the length of a mini-series, allowing the characters to be developed and their crises to unfold in full.<br /><br />Alas, this adaptation is film length.  Things must be cut.  The movie feels as if the screenwriters forgot to cut things until halfway through, at which point the story rushes far too much.  Events get compressed to occur at the same time, even in the same room. The movie ends with insipid voiceovers just this side of \\"they all lived happily ever after.\\"<br /><br />More troublesome to many, the screenwriters decided to *add* things. There's a strong political critique of slavery and the slave trade, a critique of how society women are similarly \\"bought and sold,\\" and a case for the strengths of feminist literature. Quiet Fanny Price transmogrifies from silent observer to feminist hero, standing up to patriarchy and learning to exercise a sharp tongue. These are modern concerns, not Jane Austen's. I'm not averse to this kind of modernizing in principle, especially since literary critics of the novel have explored these themes.  It's weird to see the criticisms be absorbed into the plot, however, as if Jane Austen came back to life and decided, \\"My critics are right, I needed to explore those issues more fully.\\"<br /><br />With few exceptions, the acting excels. A special call-out to the late Harold Pinter, winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, who plays the patriarch Lord Bertram in the most substantial screen role of his career. Unfortunately, Pinter and the other actors are not given the time to explore their characters fully because the plot must charge along to finish in time. It probably would have been wise to delete a few characters entirely.<br /><br />That headlong rush ultimately makes the film unsatisfying. I don't mind modern adaptations, even if they do some violence to the author's original intent - they become the screenwriters' vision, which we can consider on its own terms. But such things still require that you take the time to do things right, or make some tougher decisions about what to eliminate.or's original intent - they become the screenwriters' vision, which we can consider on its own terms.

B007BFSYMS|4.0|Got this FAOD and have been using it nightly. Husband will only allow one sound, but it has helped us both sleep better. Ocean waves reminds him of summertime on Lake Ontario. Some of the sounds we can't imagine being restful, but everyone has different sleep triggers. A dripping water faucet would be like torture to us. Nice app.
B004TACMZ8|5.0|I am a HVAC/R contractor and used the older model for years and this newer model for a few months.  I the islands the buildings are blocks, concrete and steel.

B0083ZRAJS|4.0|The story of Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz is one that almost everyone knows by heart. The movie has been a classic Thanksgiving staple since long before I was born and continues to be shown to this day. However with the addition of new books and movies to the old Canon the classic book has fallen into obscurity. Though the movies have the same flavor they all lack the true richness of the story of the first in L. Frank Baum's twelve book long series. The book is written in a classic fairy tail style that is easy and quick to read and providers multitudes of delightful lessons and allegories to the observant reader. Highly recommended to those who delight in fable and fairy tales and, of course, for children.
145552347X|4.0|Nicely written; very opinionated but, hey, why not?<br />If you have a friend who is ill, you might want to read this before you put your foot in your mouth.
B000SEVVLK|4.0|I am somewhat surprised by the negative reviews of this book, as I'm a regular reader of chicklit such as Weisberger's for light, fun escapist reading, and this one is a quite good addition to the genre. It's not as good as the author's [[ASIN:0767914767 The Devil Wears Prada]], but most authors only get one hit like that in a lifetime (and once you've had Meryl Streep play a character you've created, there's really nowhere to go but down!) If you judge this book on its own merits, and know what you are getting, you'll probably enjoy it.<br /><br />The plot centers on three single NYC women approaching 30. One is a restaurant manager who has just experienced a major breakup, one is an editor who has just gotten engaged but is unsure she wants to go through with the marriage, and one is a gorgeous female 'player' who's parents are pushing her to settle down, but who isn't at all sure she wants to. The book covers one year of their lives, as they each make a vow to in some way change their current patterns. These are 'Cosmo', Sex-in-the-City type women, open about sex and to having one night stands, so if that offends your moral sensibilities, this isn't the book for you. The model-player character practically makes a living out of manipulating men, so you can draw your own conclusions as to whether that makes her liberated or sexist.<br /><br />I liked all of the characters, and their struggles, and didn't find them at all whiney, as some reviewers have complained. It's chicklit for crying out loud! Keep you expectations in alignment with that, and you will probably enjoy this book.

B008L40Q7E|5.0|James Bond has recovered from the near fatal wound that he received in his last adventure against SMERSH. M has decided to give him a soft job to get him back in the swing of things. The head of the Jamaica station and his secretary have been murdered, although no one knows it. They have simply disappeared. M wants to know what has happened so he sends James. When Bond arrives he is met with a strange mystery. It seems that all of the trouble is coming from a place called Crab Island which is owned by the reclusive Dr. No. Now Bond has to get himself back in shape to hunt down the truth behind this elusive and potentially deadly new foe.<br /><br />There is everything we expect from a Bond novel, a beautiful, sexy woman, an evil villain, dangerous traps, and determined heroics from 007. As always the Bond books are a lot of fun.
B000IEPFCG|3.0|I got this watch about a year ago ... and wore it regularly. It's pretty accurate, just a hair fast. No question about the basic quality, but there are better values when you look at features.<br /><br />For the price, or just a little more, you can get more watch. This watch is small for a man, and very plain.<br /><br />If you're new to automatic watches and not sure you'll like them, you can get a similar Seiko 5 with a canvas band for $50.<br /><br />If you know you'll like an automatic watch, there's a good chance that in a short time, you'll want to upgrade (and for not much more money) and this will sit in a drawer.<br /><br />You can get 100M rated Seikos with nicer bracelets for about $135, 200M Seiko divers for under $200, Invicta 200M divers with nicer bracelets and Seiko movements for under $90.<br /><br />However, this is a good choice if what you're really looking for is a small, very understated field watch with a metal bracelet. That's exactly what this is, nothing more.<br /><br />I decided I wanted something more substantial and passed this on to my teenage daughter.

B0025KVLT2|5.0|Growing up in the 60's was an awesome experience. Getting a new Beatles album, well...If you shared that experience-YOU KNOW!! What memories. This album was played over and over till the grooves wore out. Thankfully the CD was invented and digital recording preserved this wonderful music. Yes there has been much debate about analog, vinyl and Digital....but each brings out something different. Yes not having the finest turntable when growing up may have influenced how you view it, but wow...when cd's came out, we were blown away.<br /><br />These cd packages remastered is like having the music new again...While I wished for remixes from the studio...these capture what was heard  when they were released and now that our ears are older....we need to hear with more bottom...HA HA...but if you love the Beatles...These remasters  have been a delight to hear. You will not be disappointed...The packaging is finally doing Justice to the beatles fan. Just wish the MONO versions were made available to the general public like the old days....oh well, maybe someday soon for download...who knows...This is great stuff that a whole new generation gets to enjoy....by the way...WHATS A BEIBER?
B009NOVCTM|1.0|Look, we've all enjoyed getting a bit ripped off from the Stones all these years. Here is all the compilation you need:  High Tide Green Grass (2 songs only available here)/Through the Past Darkly (2 songs only available here)/Sucking in the 70s (3 songs only available here)/ Step Back (OK, you have all these, but it's a really good compilation and liner notes)/ Made in the Shade (they released this and Sucking in the cardboard sleeves like the London/Decca collection, so it fits in with the others) Made in the Shade  is the lamest compilation and cover ever but it's so bad, you gotta have it).<br /><br />The really frightening thing about this is that the London/Decca tracks are on the Universal label here. Good god. Look, those tracks have been perfected. You can only perfect music. After that you can only alter it. Whatever it is, it will only get worse....Who can edit a 3 minute song? That's the future on the Stones catalog, I guess....<br /><br />Also there is enough new material on this, Charlie Darling CD, and the Ya Yas box to have issued a great Rarities II. But noooo...<br /><br />And why only use the IBC tracks from the Bright Lights bootleg, when we know the Chicago tracks exist in both mono and stereo mixes.<br /><br />Also one of the reviewers has reported that he got 2 defective disks in the 5 disk set. This is a higher than average rate of defective CDs. I responded with a comment see: \\"Nice packaging but 2 damaged cd's!!!,\\" If you get defective CDs, please report it in your review or your dealer.  Defective CDs tend to come in successive runs. I know for a fact the Universal label has a higher than average defect-rate.<br /><br />Now, as far as what Grrr means? Go look in Ed Sanders book Fug You on page 38.

B00BCZUAE8|3.0|Justin Timberlake returns after a seven year gap with his third solo album 'The 20/20 Experience' and to be honest it falls a bit short of the incredibly high bar that he set with 'Futuresex/Lovesounds' (FSLS) and this album does even come close to what he did on that album nor 'Justified'. A couple of tracks in it becomes all to apparent that he stuck his midtempo middle of the road groove that wouldn't have been bad if it wasnt coming  from the guy that gave the world FSLS. Also none of this songs scream I'm going to be the chart topper let alone the next single. Hopefully Mr. Timberlake will have for us a better album next go around.
B007HJ84WS|3.0|Too long and story has been told. Good cinematography though. Good action film but drawn out at times. Seems like a takeoff on &#34;300.&#34;
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|This is the worst google app I have ever seen. I would like to see a basic app like I have on my iphone. My phone app is better than this one.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|While the plot is very clear and the story well written, the ending was a bit too &#34;Hollywood&#34; for me. This movie brings to light the dangerous work our service members in uniform and our government officials have faced and continue to perform.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|The HBO production of the RR Martin books is true to the story and through excellent casting brings out all of the undercurrents of intrigue and adventure. Bit on the risqué and should be watched by an adult audience.
B007CKNX28|5.0|The songs on this CD are incisive, accurate, and realistic. Love Interruption reveals an insight into the complexity of human relationships and something good can be said about all the songs on this CD.
B002EWD0I6|5.0|I would recommend it to anyone, but especially families.  Very heartwarming with great character studies.  Beautiful scenery. Interesting plots. Excellent!
B004FGMV0W|5.0|Everything that was said about this CD was true. I was looking for it cheap and thanks to them I found it!
B009KEN87O|5.0|Very nice job! brings back memories. More fun than it looks. Very addicting. More words, more words, more words, more words.
B000NA1OXY|5.0|Everything that was said about this CD was true. I was looking for it cheap and thanks to them I found it!
B005LAIIFS|5.0|My family and I saw this movie when it first came to the theater and we loved it so much we wanted our own copy.  The little wind-up eggs are so cute my children love them.
B0006FO8RA|5.0|Everything that was said about this CD was true. I was looking for it cheap and thanks to them I found it!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The actors are terrific and the characters are endearing. Maggie Smith's is wonderful and always makes us chuckle. The story is never boring. The set and costumes are beautiful.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is one of the best games ever and it is free so get it and get temple run 2
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|The Intel Core i5-3570k has exceed my expectations.  I expect this processor to be relevant for a few years to come.  Easy to overclock, even with the stock cooler, seems to do a good job.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so fun.  I have had no problems with it.  It is very realistic. I mean really. WOW.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love how streamlined the interface of this app is. I am busy and this app puts the best of Pinterest at my fingertips. I run it on my Kindle Fire. If I didn't have this app I wouldn't use Pinterest.
B0060MYM7O|4.0|This series has really sucked me in.  I wish the seasons where longer and not so far apart.  I am just now watching season two on Blu-Ray while season three is being aired on HBO so I have to watch myself so I don't hear about season three.  I was surprised with this show but really do like it and would recommend it.
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|This was a cute game. The pets needed a ton of attention. I would buy this app for about four dollars if the play for real money feature was excluded. I learned to read the descriptions of games closer and I refuse to get any that play with real money... thank you lesson learned.
B005M2A4DE|4.0|I am behind on my show watching and haven't been able to watch this season yet.  As soon as I finish the fifth season I wll watch this one.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Very good graphics and puzzles. Love the underwater scene its worth the money.Atleast try the small virgin very additing.<br /><br />Ty
B003EV6DBW|4.0|I did not really grow up watching the original series of Doctor Who on PBS.  The few times I had seen it I was not that interested in it.  I started watching the restart of this show and have been hooked ever since.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|best game for tablet ever.  recommended to people who love time games. like breeding can range from 30 Mins-48hrs thgat kind of game or you need to build habitats to place dragons in
B009KEN87O|5.0|Works well and fun gameplay. Simple time killer. Wish that you could keep power ups longer though. Graphics and music are just right
B00A7Q814Y|5.0|I love this set. 95 works by 13 composers and a great price. The issue of the disks not in original jackets is a legitmate point but really its about the music and that matters more to me than packaging. If your just getting into Classical music this set is the one to get. Variety of composers played by one of the best orchestras in the world with quality sound. Well done DG.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|For the price(free) you can't ask for a better bargain.  It does the job that most file managers does and seems to blend into the Nexus very well.  Like I say, free is good!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Really good and is fun when you are bored.good that's it's free, really nice so for young chosen couldn't get my sister of the so she was hooked xx xx xx xx
B00BJ64FU0|3.0|The Amazon description says that this book was &#34;carefully proofed&#34;. It may have been spell checked, but it couldn't have been proofread, because there are many instances of similar but incorrect words in the text.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|is very good and good price i need much this product i like i love it all  . . .
B00632HWOG|1.0|Way too much spam!! I am going to delete it. I have used gmail for over a year and get no spam at all!! Yahoo is terrible.
B004KZDV8E|5.0|is very good and good price i need much this product i like i love it all  . . .
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Think its fun but takes too long to reach levels. Acorns could come more often as well as scratch coins. All in all I like this game very much!
B00A14SQBU|5.0|I have followed Christina Aguilera's career since she first hit the radio in the late 90's and everything she's done since then has been a true measure of talent, rather than just a reliance on auto-tune and catchy pop beats. I lost interest in her career after her album &#34;Bionic&#34; was a disappointment.<br /><br />I picked up this album when it was on sale for $1.99 and I was willing to take a chance on it after hearing &#34;Just A Fool&#34;. I'm so glad I got this album! The first song, &#34;Lotus Intro&#34; is ethereal and empowering all at once, and Christina's strong vocals take a backseat to her honest lyrics about leaving pain and loss behind to release her beautiful, artful soul. This album isn't just about trials and tribulations, though it does touch on it without feeling too heavy.<br /><br />&#34;Lotus&#34; has a collection of fun pop songs that make you want to move and sing along. Her melodies rival the best pop songs on the radio right now and I'd much prefer to hear her music on the airwaves other than Lady Gaga or Katy Perry. I wouldn't change anything about this album, it's a perfect composition; fun, ethereal, honest, and artful. Christina's voice is just getting better and she experiments with it on this album. Sometimes, it's soft and understated, other times, it's a force of nature.<br /><br />I highly recommend this album to new and old fans alike. You won't be disappointed!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I really enjoy this game it a great game and it exceeds my expectations. just as fun or maybe more fun then the original temple run!
B003RD5WRI|5.0|I got the wrong DVD format, sent it<br />Back got credit within the week ! The<br />DVD is a type B DVD so it doesn't<br />Play on my player, good item<br />Was wraped in nice case
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|If I could give 31/2 stars that would be my review of the movie.  A solid B-.  I love Tolkien and the other movies in this franchise, but I was a little disappointed with the amount of CGI and the oohing and ahhing over 'big' moments.  I did enjoy the movie and have watched it more than once since purchasing it.  These are just my gripes and in no way is it a deal breaker.  Martin Freeman is a gem as always and totally nails his role.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I really liked this book and the whole set.  Will likely read them again.  And recommend to other readers.  Good
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Couldn't put this book down :) Love the characters! Deals with serious life issues in a sensitive and realistic way.
B000FC2PKG|3.0|This was an unusual book of me.  Not sure how to state it.  I will have to read it again.
B00992CF6W|5.0|So gun I wish it was like the one on the computer but WAT EVER LO L<br /><br /> you should get this games
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|A great movie by a great Director. Too bad that the ultra-Liberals condemned the film as it does not meet their standards of &#34;truth.&#34;  Highly recommended
B000SEI230|4.0|Great teaching of faith.  I would encourage everyone to read this.  Encourages you to look at people in a different light.  A wonderful book!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Just when I thought I had it all figured out. I can't wait to read the last book. I'm hooked.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|An easy read with substance. Fabulous story telling. Although there are many characters, I enjoy the slight mental challenge of keeping up with fascinating lives. As the book neared the end I began to sulk, lives this interesting it shouldn't end. In the meantime I'll read the first book again.
B00A85EMVK|1.0|The images are blurry and pixelated, it looked exactly like when you have to gain the exposure on a video or still camera beyond the limits. I regret having bought this and will not recooemnd it to anyone. I have a new Blue-Ray 3D player and a brand new Philips 55&#34; 3D flatscreen.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|This took me back to another place and time. I wish I could have stayed. True Hendrix fans will love this. Great production job.Thanks.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game! I now understand all the hype.It is free which is a bonus. Believe me, it is NOT a temple run copy. A great game.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this is a really great app but I wish there was more you could do. Also I wish that's the price for gems wasn't so high. other than that it is a good game.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I'm addicted. cant put it down at all and I just keep looking to get those coins so I can get the new characters
B00BRR66SA|5.0|Yeah theres only 10 tracks on this album, but when every song is nearly 7 minutes (or sometimes more) its hard to put anymore on here. It truly is one of those albums that shows that JT is still as relevant today as he was back then with the continued growth as an artist. I admit, I never thought he would make it past the 90s, but here he is almost 15 years later, making a soul album. With solid production from Timbaland, it really has the power to make album of the year. There are plenty of hit songs on here, so expect to hear a bunch more singles before the year is out.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|no glitches so far. I've been playing the app for a little over a day now. runs smooth on my kindle fire.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|one of our favorite movies.  Bought this for a christmas present .  If you havent seen it, you neeed to.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|i love the animation in this movie over and over to get all the points i missed plus i love big cats
B00005JLEU|5.0|We have this movie on Vhs but needed it on dvd.  My daughter is 18 and still loves this movie,
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is soooo much better than the first. The way it ends is amazing! \\"Katniss there is no district 12\\"! Priceless!
B007DIQC90|5.0|Love this CD, love all of the songs.  This is definitely one to buy.  Bought this for a Christmas present
B00992CF6W|5.0|I LOVE THE GAME AND IT IS SO WORTH IT TO BUY. AND IF YOU DON'T YOUR A LOSER.BHDHDGDJSJSKDJHFGFHF GSGVSHBD BSBSB
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|I bought this DVD after seeing their documentary on Showtime. It looks great in blue ray and the sound is like you are there.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Excellent replacement for Google Reader. It requires zero effort to migrate from Google Reader to Feedly. I recommend it wholeheartedly. It rocks.
B009LT1YZ6|3.0|This app did not keep my attention very long. Although I do still play it from time to time. I got this as the free app of the day through Amazon. All I can say is I'm glad I did not pay for it.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|I have this for Kindle Fire. It's a very clever game and is genuinely fun. however, it stops working more often than not. Frustrating.
1931559317|5.0|Easy to carry with you and helps you to find what your looking for in short order!  I don't have a goto scope, but with this who needs one!
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|This was entertaining.  Hints were great and skip comes in handy at times too. challenging enough to be fun but not pull yourhair out frustrating.
1476734941|4.0|Most of us have heard about fasting before, but this breaks it down to a science, and tells us how it can improve our health. Mainly, this book, using science, tells us that fasting can help us:<br /><br />1. Lose weight<br />2. Stay Healthy<br />3. Live a longer, and better quality of life<br /><br />The book breaks it down into step-by-step explanations that are not hard to understand. It can be beneficial to just about anybody.<br /><br />Lastly this book takes fasting to a new level, and is one of the best on the topic. This book is to fasting what [[ASIN:1479780243 Make Money at Home: A Quick Guide: Special Edition]] is to your pocketbook: essential.
B005DKLPF6|5.0|Amazing metal from start to finish. I've only heard 3 Mastodon albums... Leviathan (least favorite), Crack the Skye (excellent), and this... THIS ROCKS!!! Less progressive than previous albums, but infinitely more enjoyable on repeated listens. MORE LIKE THIS, please!!!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Game of thrones is a fantastic series on HBO and season two did not disappoint! The show is a must see!!!
B007XNAOS0|5.0|I Love this album. Its like three of my favorite bands (The Sword, Pink Floyd, Radiohead) thrown into a blender with a pinch of Mastodon and a Special Ingredient never before tasted and whipped into musical heaven. This album is essential from beginning to end. Amazing mellow musical intros and outros emphasize and tie-together heavy segments of prog-rock. This has become one of my favorite albums.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|Very well done.  Finally, we have the answer to how it all started before the original Planet of the Apes.  The animations were excellent. Hail Caesar.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Excellent read. Only complaint is it's &#34;Novella&#34; length, but that's a complaint because I want more! Off to hunt for more titles from this author...
B002C6A6N6|5.0|I love this series and i am thrilled to have it all in one set. The first set of CD's in the set are very frustrating. It jumps and skips a lot and the sounds do not match the video. The rest of the series seems to be okay though. I am about half way through. The only other issue is that some of the episodes are out of order.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|I like the obstacles such as the locks. It makes it more challenging other than just matching 3 (or more).  The story is also a nice touch.
B009E9QOEO|5.0|Just when I thought I had enough Led Zeppelin on my iPod . . . This recording is awesome.  They still have the energy they had in the '70s. Jason Bonham fills in perfectly for his father, Bonzo would be proud!
B0009HLD0K|5.0|Great casting, excellent story-line, funny and heart-warming.  A real slice-of-life film from Middle America in the 70's. Dennis Quaid and Daniel Stern back in the day!
B007REV4YI|5.0|This movie is full of action, twists, turns, and surprises.  Daniel Craig may be the best Bond actor, and this is by far his performance as 007 James Bond.  Even the title song, sung by Adele, is haunting and terrific.  I have seen this movie several times already, and it is worth seeing many more times.  Enjoy this thriller with a vodka martini - shaken not stirred.<br /><br />You will NOT be disappointed by purchasing this movie, and it is a must-have for all fans of \\"Bond - James Bond.\\"
B0063M22QO|5.0|Mahjong is a time-honored mental acuity and strategy game.  It is fantastic to have a wide variety of mahjong games available at your fingertips and convenient for play in any situation where you and your tablet find yourselves together.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Way better than the movie and Katie/Erin was a very strong person it takes a lot to do what she did.
B005TVYVI2|1.0|I regret not taking into account previous negative reviews that describe this unit as having a tendency to fail within the first few usages.  The main issue appears to be that the rubber buttons in the front that one uses to start/stop it and adjust the tempo are very fragile and leak water in to the main compartment, causing it to short.  I was very cautious to treat it gently, and still had it die on the fourth use.  It's a shame because it is a great thing to have for a swimmer working on stroke technique.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was amazing with lots of action and just the right amount of romance and the story line was brilliant and one of a kind.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is the best! I get to interact with all my favorite ponies and colts. I could play it all day!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a very good game with a lot of cool powerups and characters. Some characters are a little expensive. But this is a very fun game.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I like to play Bingo. It is fun to be playing with others all over the country. I wish the daily bonus was given twice a day. One thing that would be fun would be to be playing other bingos not just straight bingo. Wish that the coin payout was bigger so that you could reach a level faster. I look forward to playing each day.
0792840461|5.0|One of the &#34;All time classics&#34; from Steve McQueen himself as a DARTMOUTH undergrad and Harvard MBA where he finally breaks away from his classics featuring him as a car racer, blah blah blah.<br /> I had once seen or read that this movie was extremely rewarding to him as an intelligent businessman dressed to the part instead of his great yet tired flics of being the car racer in days past!<br /> This movie has been viewed by my wife and myself many times although just now getting around to finally purchasing the DVD. WELL WORTH EITHER THE RENT OR THE PURCHASE, BELIEVE ME!<br /> BTW, I write this NOT to be bias in ANY way but it reveals that STEVE was versatile in his acting skills and so happened that I attended DARTMOUTH however was hooked on this great flick WAY before college was ever in my headlights!<br /> GO BUY IT OR RENT IT! It will put the &#34;OTHER&#34; phony knockoffs to shame!<br />All the best, JP
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I loved it!!!! It's just as good as the other temple runs!!!! And it makes me and my friend laugh!!! We loved it!! And here is some advice if you ever get it! If a monkey comes in front of you then just duck!! That took me a long time to figure out so ya. Btw it's REALLY REALLY FUN!!!!!!
B00136S0NE|4.0|Wonderful winsome style.  Not a whole lot of feel good sounds herein but a great blend of sweetness with a dash of anger and forelorn lovesickness.  The blending of their voices on the duets are amazing.  Several of the songs just soar they are so feather light.  Irish music for people who don't particularly like Irish music.
B005T87QCI|5.0|It is awesome going against atom and noisy boy in this game so what I'm trying to say is get the game
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|It is a really awesome game but there are glitches. There is a glitch that takes away your money. One time I had $17,000 but when I came back . I had 11,000. Another is when you get stuck and your not near anything but open ground. But that one only lasts for 2 seconds. Other than that AWESOME game. I would rate 4.5 stars if I could. But 5 stars is better then 4.
B000035Z1Z|5.0|The DVD arrived very quickly, and in excellent condition! This is a wonderful movie, and the quality of the disc and cover were perfect!!
B00B7IJDMA|4.0|The soundtrack captures the mood of the show beautifully. The songs are haunting and remind me of the scenes in which they were used. Awesome compilation for fans.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|so cute. really fun game. ^~^ I recommend it. really great for animal lover's and horse lovers. good luck on your new adventure &lt;3
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Quality was really good.  3D effects were a little less obvious, but there were parts where it really stood out, especially snow falling.  The story was great and they didn't edit the film, so it's exactly the same as the 2D version.
B0034G4P80|5.0|What a perfect blend of great acting, adventure and humor!  Our entire family loved it!  Great story also.<br /><br />Content is low on anything sexual or profane, but it has a good amount of the typical violence found in a superhero movie --- along the same lines as any action-packed film that has digitally-created creatures of all kinds and superhumans fighting them and each other.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Quality was really good.  3D effects were a little less obvious, but there were parts where it really stood out, especially some flying scenes and when the ash from the burning was falling.  Same movie as the 2D, no editing.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Excellent game that is simple to play, but challenging to do well at.  Simple to understand and has the option to always improve your time and score.  Great for all ages and skill  level.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love temple run2 the features are so good and I like how they made it look kinds 3D love it love it love it!!!!!!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this. It is simple and handy. Anyone can use this with ease. Get it now and you will need nothing else.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|The Hobbit<br />An Unexpected Journey<br /><br />I had planned to watch this in the theater, but sometimes life has other plans.  So I was eagerly anticipating this prequel to the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  I was not disappointed and am looking forward to the second in this trilogy series.<br /><br />There are scenes that were not in The Hobbit but were found in other of Tolkien's writings.  But to be perfectly honest what movie is exactly like every book upon which it is based.  Some movies are so loosely based on the books that other than the title of the movie and the names of the characters there is no similarity, but that is not the case with The Hobbit.<br /><br />I like the fact that the movie brings in LOTR's with Bilbo writing about his adventures to Frodo and that it takes place just before the birthday party and Frodo getting the ring.<br /><br />An Unexpected Journey is a great first installment in the Tolkien world and I hope the successive installments are as well conceived and delivered.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|Have read all of Emily Griffin's books, you think you can figure out the end but often times she puts a little twist to it
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Nice braingame. It really makes you want to try and get the least moves on each level. Very cool if there isn't anything on tv. I kid... The graphics and sound are perfect, even on my HTC rezound.<br />It's great.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Excellent retro graphics that are also in 3-D. Simple touch and drag controls to  maneuver your ship. Fun and addictive Galaga style game play with many many waves to select from. Each wave has challenges to achieve such as no deaths, collect all stars, and fast completion time. Pretty visuals and unique power ups, one of which changes the camera to be behind your ship allowing you to blast enemies from a different perspective. Music is okay and fits the game well.<br /><br />Highly recommend! Get this game now!
B00A8LRIEW|5.0|Seems to be a song or two shorter than a proper full album should be, but as what's essentially a set of unpublished B-sides from the Waiting for the Siren's Call album a few years ago... that's all good!<br /><br />The music itself feels a little rushed, not quite as sophisticated as NO's earlier stuff. As a product of their temporary reformation where they punched out two albums very quickly (Get Ready was the first), this third &#34;album&#34; proves that they've still got a good sound, but they really needed a little more time in the oven with it.<br /><br />Still, it's always a treat to get more fresh New Order, and to that, I say WOOHOO!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|the game is ok but you don't get the zen garden or some of the quick play games or the presents
B009UZBLSG|4.0|It works as advertised on my Nexus 4.  I tried it with my computer monitor as well as my tv and both worked fine.  Upon connecting the phone would go into landscape mode.  I was able to play video and also stream from netflix with no problems.  Both video and audio were fine.  For people who like to mod their phones: I did try it with a CM10.1 nightly roms, but it didn't work as seamlessly.  It would show the image on the tv, but then the phone screen would shut off.  That would be fine if using an external mouse/keyboard, but if using only the phone, I had to guess where to tap and swipe.
1897299214|1.0|Supposedly a \\"regular Joe's\\" view of a different country/culture, Pyongyang is in fact heavily political in its nature.<br /><br />This is revealed straight away with the author attempting to smuggle George Orwell's \\"1984\\" into North Korea. A blunt and heavy handed metaphor that tells us much more about Delisle than the country he's visiting, a topic on which he had obviously made up his mind even before his visit!<br /><br />Many of his observations are in fact criticism's of North Korea's political system by the worst sort of individual you'd want to ask an opinion: biased, uneducated on the topic and inept at observation at the same time.<br /><br />Without putting the current state of affairs in Korea into the proper historical context, with at least an elementary knowledge of international relations and the workings of various political systems its impossible to formulate a sound and unbiased opinion on the subject!<br /><br />This wouldn't have been an issue if Delisle's observations weren't so obviously political in nature, and so heavily critical in the same shallow, ideologically motivated way a CNN report might be.<br /><br />Its as if Delisle wrote and drew this piece specifically to appeal to the western liberal mindset, a job he could have done without ever stepping into North Korea. He went in looking for Orwell, and Orwell he found. No one is surprised.<br /><br />A word on the art: poor. Simplicity without any semblance of style. Few people would be so brazen to publish the equivalent of sketches as a finished product.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game this game is Soo epic I have both versions on my kindle fire and this one is a lot better best part about this game is that its free and those are the best games to have on anything.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|She has a great voice and my husband even loved this CD.  Hard to believe that<br />she was the first American idol!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I loved every minute of it!!!  Can't wait to watch all the seasons at one time... daryl is my favorite character.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|The first CD of Taylor Swift that I have purchased.  It has several songs that I love.  It is hard to believe that she is so young and talented!
B002OSXDAU|5.0|I am a freshman reading this book for my English 2 class. I am not even finished with this book yet, but I love it. I love Ayn Rand's writing style and how she describes the world. She paints an amazing picture of each of the characters and of the architecture. I also love the main character's ((Howard Roark)) philosophy on architecture.
B00914JWSW|4.0|I love her voice but I was disappointed with this product.  It seems like her voice is<br />not as loud as it used to be.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Loved the book. At first I didn't get the back and forth chapters, but the more I read the more I enjoyed it.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Love his voice and therefore the CD was great!  It was good to hear him perform a<br />different type of music.
B004XZR63M|3.0|More a phillosophy than a how-to but a nice very basic primer on investing. Interested in getting the board game.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I love to read and I read this book in two days while I played around sick. I love all of Sparks books but this one was different. It was suspenseful and let you on the edge. Great book and now I can't wait to see the movie!!
B005KELQEU|5.0|I used this style with my old kindle and was very pleased to see that they have it for the paper white.  It keeps my kindle secure and safe and has the extra zipper so that I can zip it shut when I charge it and the kindle does not fall out.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I am getting a little impatient with this series. I want to like it, but really, must every likeable character get the shaft? And I feel that the plot has run away with itself.
B004M20YDU|5.0|Ever wish there were MORE tron sounds?  Well, here they are with all of the edge flaunted the way you like it.
B000SGGUWS|3.0|this was an okay read. Not well rounded at all. No conclusions to the book at all. Just open ended curiosity with everything. I'm glad the next couple of books are out, because if they weren't the series would be dead to me before it began.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|I just started using my Amazon Prime account and this was the first movie I streamed!<br />Even though I had seen it on the big screen, the movie had me captivated from start to finish!
B007G92QGO|3.0|The core thread in this murder mystery novel is the journey of Andy Barber as he faces the possibility that his son, Jacob, might be a killer. Told from Andy's perspective, the reader never really gets to know Jacob other than through the eyes of his father. Even as Andy and his wife start to disagree on whether their son was capable of this crime, the innermost feelings of Laurie, the mother, are never revealed to the reader other than through the limited conversations with Andy. This may be viewed as a shortcoming in the novel but instead it lends an extra depth to the story in a surprising fashion.<br /><br />The story moves at a rapid pace and keeps the reader engrossed at all times. An interesting mechanism which also adds to the depth of the story is the use of court transcripts to relay certain aspects of the story. These are used intermittently and to great effect to give the reader a glimpse of future developments without actually giving the plot away ahead of time.<br /><br />Defending Jacob is well worth the read as it slots nicely in the murder mystery genre without adhering to the crime solving formula.
B00BSBU4EC|1.0|I WAS VERY DISAPOINTED IN THE MOVIE, IT DRAGGED ON AND ON AND IT WAS VERY PREDICTABLE!  IT COULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD MOVIE BUT WAS A LET DOWN...
B005KAH7QU|1.0|Hanna (Saoirse Ronan) is trained in the woods by Eric Bana for some unknown challenge.  She pushes a button on a transponder and is soon being pursued by CIA baddie (Cate Blanchett)  Hanna uses her ninja-type skills to evade capture until a final confrontation with Blanchett.<br /><br />Nothing very exciting about the movie. The plot isn't explained until the end and in my opinion was not done well.<br /><br />For a better film involving a young woman taking out the bad guys, you may want to try Luc Besson's \\"Columbiana.\\"  While that film wasn't perfect either, it has a far better plot and was much more interesting than Hanna.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I downloaded these for my grandson.  They are.  big hit.  He stayed busy while we were out running errands.  They were easy for him to comprehend, too.

B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book is awesome. It shows love Can conquer all. It starts out slow, but then picks up speed. Awesome.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The best book and movie...everyone should read the book and then go to the movie.  Take the time to do both.
B004K8WPUQ|3.0|Sound quality does not change a lot. It is very difficult to replace the battery. I just afraid I will snap the door.
B002Q4U9YU|5.0|I think we all wish he could have had the experienced the entire  MJ/Kenny family (dancers, singers, music and all the others that don't get seen) One show at the O2 arena would have made him a very happy man, because in the end; he was doing it for his children and his fans. What a tragedy!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This book was a little slow to start out, but did grab my interest and kept me reading. It is a good book with interesting characters.
0141439688|5.0|So glad I reread Persuasion recently. I think it may even have jumped ahead of Sense and Sensibility on my top Jane Austen list (P&P and Emma still reign supreme). Anne Elliott is a great protagonist.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Was glad I put it on my kindle.keeps me amused but hate running out of time.Recommend it to friends.Hope others will enjoy it.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This was my first experience with Elizabeth Gaskell's novel and I loved this miniseries! Very well done! Though BBC always seems to do a great job on these classics.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|If you enjoy match 3 games you will really like this one. It has challenges along with time restraints.  Play fast and furious
B00AEFY3DQ|5.0|I had a small part in this film so I'm slightly biased.  It was a lot of fun to work on and the cast, in general, provided a good amount of off screen entertainment.  I think the camaraderie is evident in the final product.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|You should get this game because you can have different people and allies to destroy the king. You can also do multiplayer which you can't do on the first.
B00A0NOF7G|3.0|Sometimes you just want to read a story that is just fun and the series of Lexy Baker cozy mysteries is perfect! It wasn't too long but the author introduced us to Lexy and friends. Try this book if you want some fun, mystery and a bit of romance!
B004EIZCPM|2.0|The trailer seemed to have most of the best humor in it. Was hoping for more, with such a good cast.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Great game. Just like I remember it from computer class back in the day when I would beat all the boys at it haha.
B005S9EKCW|3.0|I personally really enjoyed it, but to say it was flawless, like many of my friends do, is not true at all. There are things that I understand bother some people, and I don't question there judgement. Some people didn't like the music (I didn't like some of it), and seeing as it's nothing but singing, that's not something you can dislike and enjoy the music anyway. Many people didn't like the soliloquies because the characters were just singing into the camera. And I enjoyed Russel Crowe, but I understand that most people didn't think he made a good Javert. I didn't mind most of these negatives, so I really enjoyed it, but I can't pretend that there aren't any.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I can make notes in church and what I want to do. I created lists on what I need at the store and what I want for holidays. In school I can write down my HW and assignments.
0062014536|5.0|****Spoiler Alert: Requiem is the third book in a trilogy. Read this review only if you've read Delirium and Pandemonium****<br /><br />This one has to start with a few notes.<br /><br />First, I love-love-love Lauren Oliver and the Delirium trilogy. This was one of those event books I was counting down to and planning ahead to drop everything for.<br /><br />Second, I'm aware that it's damn near impossible for there to be a perfect ending to a lead-up as intense as this series. I accept that.<br /><br />That said, let us proceed to this crazy fangirl's best attempt at fairness.<br /><br />The Basics:<br /><br />Lena and the other rebels who've escaped the procedure to cure them of amor deliria nervosa (love) are no longer being ignored by the authorities in the regulated cities. The Wilds where they've taken refuge are under attack, and Lena is forced to fight back in a full-scale resistance alongside both Julian, the boy she's just rescued from the cure in Pandemonium, and Alex, the first love she'd assumed dead after he was shot while rescuing her from the cure in Delirium. Meanwhile, in regulated territory, Lena's former best friend, Hana, is coming to realize that her own cure may not have been entirely successful, and that her assigned fianc&eacute;, the soon-to-be mayor of Portland, is still a dangerous psychopath in spite of his.<br /><br />The Downside:<br /><br />With Lena spending almost the entire book in the emotionally unregulated Wilds and Hana's storyline limited almost completely to people who can't be completely cured, the very powerful basic concept of the trilogy doesn't get to shine as much as in the previous two books. The moments when ordinary love is made breathtakingly special by its contrast with a total absence of love are present but fewer and farther between, making it feel more like any other dystopian rebel epic. The body count demanded by such an epic also means there are a lot of background characters who aren't quite worth getting to know. I won't spoil which shippers come away triumphant (or whether I was one of them), but I will say that, after a full book's absence, and with the scarce and mostly negative showing Alex gets (he's got some issues to work out after escaping from the Crypts), he's a lot harder to root for than he probably should be.<br /><br />The Upside:<br /><br />It's Lauren-freaking-Oliver. It's some gutsy, cutting, and seriously poetic prose. The bloody dystopian rebel epic storyline may not be as innovative as the original Delirium concept, but it's still a fantastic bloody dystopian rebel epic, and like everything Oliver does, she makes it fresh. Even without the ever-present feeling-free backdrop that threw the drama of the first two books into such sharp relief, she can still cut through the numbness of a jaded reader. She still unfailingly makes me cry and cringe and cower at all the right moments as only the power of a good book can.<br /><br />Those throwaway background characters actually do add to the surrounded-by-death feel of the rebels' world in a way extras' deaths seldom do, partly because it's very clear that their deaths do not mean that the main characters are safe. No one is. Nothing is. The first two books set a clear enough precedent that no horrifying detail of this universe will be glossed over or sanitized when it arises, but Requiem really pulls all that lurking horror into the light, pushes it as far as it can go, then pushes farther, without it ever reaching the relief of the cartoonish too-far.<br /><br />The parallel storylines of Lena surviving in the impoverished and violent Wilds and Hana fearing for her life and her conscience in her fianc&eacute;'s pristine mansion offers a similar, if not quite as dramatic, contrast to the one the cure created in the first two books, with the added explosive tension of waiting for their two lives to collide again. The bonus short story included in Requiem's first printing, while not essential to the overall story, is definitely worth getting your hands on. As well as being a gut punch in its own right, it offers the sympathy for Alex that's hard to come by in the novel itself. In fact, I might recommend reading the short story first for that reason.<br /><br />The end is... open-ended. Tidy conclusion to the epic it's not, but it works with the spirit of the story. A world where love exists is untidy and unpredictable and uncontrollable, but it's better than the alternative. That's kind of the point.definitely worth getting your hands on.

B0073QWCAA|5.0|I love these movies and now I have them in Blu ray!  How much better can it get.  I think Alien 3 sucks though.
B00AK0X5VQ|3.0|This game is fun and different at first, but as you progress through the levels, it gets ridiculous and impossible to play. Fine for a free game, but wouldn't pay for it.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Great game! Very addicting. Controls are sensitive and precise on both my android and ipad. Glad I got this game!
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|great movie lol the hole time. kept me watchin . going to watch again and again.comedy of the year #1
B00AREIAI8|4.0|it is a fairly good game. But I really do not like how long it takes if you can not spend money. That is why it is only three star.
B00A85EMVK|5.0|It's Top Gun in 3D Blu-Ray. That should say it all. For anyone who loves this movie, you need to own this. It's a very well done remaster and the sound is better than ever.  The 3D was admittedly much better in IMAX but that's to be expected.  The 2D Blu-Ray is a noticeable improvement over the old DVD I have.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I have Temple Run and thoroughly enjoy the new graphics in this Temple Run 2. You have to accomplish different feat per each player and it takes long to move on quickly as formerly.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Loved this book and how I got so wrapped up in it. It made me feel like I was Megan and experiencing what she was.
B0094K1K42|3.0|Charlize Theron is a great actress but one has seen her in better parts. The movie definitely showed a woman wrapped in the thrones of going back home to a former lover with hope of living a romance while not evening having some true direction in own life. Amazing, through it all she regained her own identity to move beyond.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|The game was raw. I had much fun I rate this game a A+ play this game.ur have fun. War war an chaos
B00AREIAI8|5.0|VERY FUN AND REALISTIC.  GREAT FOR HORSE LOVERS CHILDREN AND ADULTS!!!!  You can join competitions and feed your horse and has tons of beautifil horses!!!!

B005K0HDGE|5.0|This was everything a King book should be and more. Jake/George was sincere, believable, and smart. The ending was a complete surprise.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This is a great pocket sized knife sharpener. Awesome for any EDC. Purchase this item to keep all of your edges at the ready.
B007N6NGYG|4.0|This game offers a good challenge.  It's got nice graphics, responsive controls, and a good set of challenges.  Most of the game is about timing of changing switches and paths for trains to travel.  Another review advised studying the challenge before starting the trains.  I second that advice.
B00B2TTVNU|5.0|I totally agree with all the praise Valentina has received  - and note that she is clearly a delightful person - look for her playing on the old upright piano at London's St. Pancras station (Youtube, two or three videos.)  Just for fun!<br /><br />Regarding the question as to why she hasn't been better known, and had a recording contract long ago, she made a post on her blog (forget the date) that she had had to fire her agent and now had a new excellent one.  Have to assume that is related...<br /><br />Wish her all the worldwide success she so richly deserves.
B007MCTTHY|4.0|This is a pretty basic game, routing liquids through various paths.  While the graphics are basic, it quickly offers a fair challenge and is oddly addictive.  The game is fun.  It's easy to pick up and put down, to take up a few minutes.<br /><br />About the only complaint I'd make is the menu screen doesn't indicate which formula book you're currently in.  So you have to remember.
0307720950|4.0|Chris Anderson is a master at looking at an existing phenom in society and writing elegantly and broadly about it's effects on the world around us.  He did it with The Long Tail, and Free, now makers.<br /><br />Some of my more snobbish friends think he uses alot of 'fill' in his books, but I like the stories about real world happenings vs. the dry theory of academia.  Anderson writes for the everyperson, not the Digitari (although they, too, can learn from his works).<br /><br />Keep it up Chris.  I love that, with this one, you walk the talk (and own your own 'maker' oriented company).<br /><br />Next up:  A book on hackerspaces (?)  Please (?)
B00BHNQ5XK|1.0|I watched this movie because a friend of mine and her husband (who was in the army)kept going on and on about how scary it was. They said they watched it twice, and it even scared them the second time. What caught my interest the most was when they said \\"I was too freaked out to even go to bed that night.\\"<br /><br />So I broke down and rented it. Even more, I set myself up to be scared. I waiting until I was home alone and turned off all the lights to prepare myself to be frightened.<br /><br />BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT EVER!<br />Not only was this movie not even mildly frightening, but it felt as though they took every cliche known to the horror genre and complied it into one movie. The acting was bad, the characters were poorly written and their \\"scary people\\" were more laughable than anything. Actually, I found myself giggling through several parts of the movie. It was, in my opinion, a predictable failure. Don't waste your money on this movie. You will only find yourself sighing and looking to see when it's going to end.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT!<br />I was really hoping the family would live, just so they wouldn't be able to create a sequel.
1609613937|5.0|This is an outstanding book that America is more than ready for.  As we move into our modern lifestyles, we are doing so at the price of killing ourselves.  This book shows how we can regain (or not lose) our health while still enjoying the good life.
B006T5C5PS|3.0|If I get cancer, I would definitely try this, but man oh man, you'd better be committed to it, because it's extremely difficult. Good read, however. If you or friends have cancer, also check out the Ketogenic Diet, which is widely used now, esp in Japan where they are getting phenomenal results and it's not as difficult as the Gerson.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This could be a starter equipment case for the budding enthusiast.  Depending on your priorities and pocketbook, this could hold your gear for quite a period of time.  It looks like an Amazon-branded knock-off of much more expensive competitors.  Amazon has learned its lessons well.  Roomy zippered compartments inside are complemented by a couple of outside side flap compartments, one on each side.  It should be simple to customize this to fit your gear.  It is well constructed in basic black inside and out, though viewing black camera components in a black case can be challenging when in a dark environment.  Use your smart phone with a flashlight app if you have to.<br /><br />The AmazonBasics Backpack is a good bag to hold a few lenses and accessories for the day's shoot.  Not too large and not too small to hold a versatile amount of gear.  However, you have to remove the backpack to access your collection.  Like all backpack-style carrying cases, it it not very easy to off-load one shoulder strap and swing the backpack around to get to your gear in a safe manner.  Most of the time you have to take any backpack off.  Practice to find your limits and carefully keep within those.  Most camera gear is not drop-proof  If you're reasonably careful, your gear should last a long time.  Have fun!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|We are enthralled with the complex interweaving of stories. The drama, intrigue, betrayals, loyalties honor and evil all presented in the most luxurious or desparate of circumstances.
B00A50PDDY|5.0|This is creativity in its purest form. Music should evoke raw emotion, and there isn't one song on this album that does not follow through. Genius!!!

B00BHMF578|4.0|Attention to detail: phones, clothes, mannerisms, technology was perfect. But, the ending was rushed and everything ended happily ever after........... I recommend this movie but once they board the plane to leave, turn off the movie before the fantasy flight down the runway begins.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is awesome! i say that cuase im a horse lover! i reccomand this game to any horse lover!!
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|This movie has everything I like about a movie. It has a good story. It has nudity. Best of all it is a revenge movie.

B00AF6B22E|4.0|Different from what the previews showed but still very good.  Good action scene when the plane is going to crash.
B000LPQ6DE|2.0|I not only did not care for the surrealistic desert-scene beginning for this production, but also found Rochester far too aggressive and self-serving right away. Rochester is irritating enough as the narrative develops, especially later at the time he nearly fools Jane into marrying him. But there is no need to start off with him immediately arrogant and overbearing. Credibility is strained. I believe this actor did not understand his role, or the production was misled into serving producers and actors instead of Jane Eyre as source.The actor playing Jane was all right, if a little too subdued.
B002GIBVV6|5.0|One you can watch over and over. This to me is the best of the re-makes and the acting is obviously superb.  Anything with Maggie Smith you know is going to be interesting.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Very nice work here, especially in the actor who plays the hotel's manager, Sonny. He is energetic, comedic, and dazzling, and really steals the show. Maggie Smith is also as usual strong and supportive in her role, and credible in her transformation from grouch and useless to savvy and effective assistant manager.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I couldn't put the book (kindle) down! I thought it was really well written...great vocabulary! Looking forward to seeing the movie.
B0099Y2MYK|3.0|After becoming hooked with Seasons 1 and 2, Season 3 left me saturated and &#34;over it.&#34; Particularly disturbing to me are the deaths of Sybil and Matthew, both seemingly gratuitous (although actors will leave the show, I presume, so must be written out), but more seriously these were horribly portrayed, particularly Sybil's. I felt nauseous in watching it. Then Matthew's demise at the end seemed another sensationalistic cheap shot to me, especially the way he was shown in the moment of death. These portrayals may indicate the writer is getting carried away, or maybe such a series is meant to end earlier. Season 3 started the show downhill for me and I won't be back for more.
1616202416|5.0|Chimamanda Adichie's debut novel Purple Hibiscus is a strong piece of Third World literature that not only speaks to the general struggle of Third World countries, but also to Nigeria specifically.<br /><br /> The novel focuses not only on Nigeria as it endures the military coup, but also focuses on the growth and change that Kambili, the main character, experiences as well. Originally, Kambili is quiet and accepting. She often considers her father's act's of repression and abuse normal and does not question his more Westernized way of thought. On the other hand, Kambili's brother Jaja is more rebellious, and often tries to live outside the boundaries his father has set.<br /><br /> When the children go to live with their father's sister, Ifeoma, due to the military coup, they finally get to experience life outside of the world of rules and schedules that their father has created. The two children are immersed in the more traditionalist Nigerian way of thinking. The growth and changes in Kambili and Jaja to become themselves and not the people their father crafted, was one of the most compelling parts of this novel. Watching the two children learn to live life was something I really enjoyed. Kambili goes from relying on education to give her an identity and instead learns to voice her own opinions and become an independent young woman outside of the education identity. Although from the beginning Jaja had rebelled against his father, he finally finds something he enjoys-gardening, and through that becomes an even stronger character.<br /><br /> I really enjoyed how the conflicts of the novel often spoke to larger themes of the Third World and Nigeria specifically. For example, when Kambili learns that her father, who is part of the bourgeoisie- like class, is not the upstanding person he claims to be, this speaks to the larger theme of how the bourgeoisie in Third World countries were a typically weak class of people. Also the contrasting pictures of Westernized Nigeria and Traditionalist Nigeria presented in the novel through the characters of Kambili's father and Aunt Ifeoma speaks to the larger idea of the struggle of trying to let these two worlds coexist peacefully in Nigeria.<br /><br /> Something else that really stuck out to me with this novel is the change from negative ideas and images in the beginning, to the more positive ideas and images in the end. In the beginning, the family really struggles to connect due to the father's abusiveness and fanatic religiousness. In the end though, they seem to unite under the oppression and become more full of life and create the connection they seemed to lack. The changes in the family speak to the idea the strength of the family unit and its power. If looking at how this alludes to Nigeria, it could be seen as Nigeria in a pre and post-colonial sense, meaning that when Nigeria was under colonial rule, the country and its people were unable to be themselves and instead were told to become what Britain wanted them to be. On the other hand, in the post-colonial sense, after gaining independence, Nigerians were able to regain their individual identities.<br /><br /> Purple Hibiscus is a truly enjoyable read that cannot be passed over. If you are looking for a wonderful book to read, read this one. If you want a wider depiction of Nigeria, I recommend Adichie's The Thing Around Your Neck and Half A Yellow Sun. These two other works along with Purple Hibiscus truly give a varied view on the country. Purple Hibiscus is a truly remarkable debut novel that did not disappoint.
B0088XQDD4|2.0|Hopkins performs well, and it is interesting to see the same quality in him as a young actor. Also outstanding is the actor playing Polonius. On the other hand, Nicol Williamson as Hamlet is too frantic in my view, so frantic I sometimes did not listen to his ranting. Also. I don't see any indication in Shakespeare that this character should sob like a child. Additionally this production eliminates important lines from the play, as with the scene where Claudius prays, and in Shakespeare Hamlet observes him and thinks about taking his revenge. Not to be found in this production where possibly Shakespeare is less important than the performance of this particular production.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I bought Quell and one day when I saw this and played the demo I was amazed. I never did get around to buying it, until I saw ITS FREE! I really recommend this!
B009KEN87O|5.0|First impression is I've played this before but the controls are better than expected and the whole game is awesome.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Sometimes you want to do something that is just entertaining and fun.  This is one of those things.  I find this enjoyable and since it was free can't beat the price.
B006T5GTK0|3.0|But keep in mind this is a very old movie and it is black and white.  The characters and story are much more developed in the book!  Read it first!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|A great novel I recommend. An easy read and wonderful ending. Will look forward to more books by this author.
B005K17RU0|2.0|Ok app but new version full of bugs.  Maps won't expand. Cant customize views.  Canr complain too much since it is free but i doubt if ill keep it on my device

B007WULJ5G|1.0|Very SICK, TWISTED, AND PERVERSE, DON'T WATCH TAKE IT FROM A FEW OF US THAT SEEN THE FILM.. I COULDN'T WATCH ALL OF IT. IN FACT I THREW IT IN THE TRASH WHERE IT BELONGS.........
B00A77II0U|5.0|This was a really great game to be able to play on my phone. I loved the graphics and music, I thought they were both really well done. The puzzles and HO scenes were fun, not too hard, not too easy. It also had a really cool, spooky story to go with it. I definitely recommend this game for anyone who likes hidden object games, puzzles, and a little creepiness.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Well it's hard to write anything without possibly giving something away but it is an &#34;amazing&#34; book and I really couldn't put it down. Twists and turns everywhere! Very well written!!
B000FA675C|5.0|Great read and very thought provoking! I'll definitely read his other books. I was intrigued by the historical and symbological facts.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I didn't know what the ending would be like but it ended at the right time. Thought they were going to catch Amy but maybe they left room for a sequel. That would be bad because this book was only ok. I need to find something withsubstance now.
0671646788|5.0|If you're like me, trying to achieve a goal and push through fear - you'll love this book. It gives you the kick in the butt necessary to move forward toward achieving what you want out of life.<br /><br />Best line - action cures fear.
B00005V1B2|5.0|Had it on Vinal, had it on Cassette, Now have the CD and still love this music as much as I did in 1976! It is truly unique!
0553296981|4.0|read this in high school many years ago but since we were going to visit Anne Frank House in Amsterdam we reread it Its a different perspective reading it as an adult rather than a teenager
B0060MYM3S|5.0|We don't get the premium channels and we were curious because of the media hype about this show.  The video was worth every dime and cannot wait for the next one.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is my new addiction in my free time. Runs quickly. No complaints. If you are looking for a fun card game this one is for you!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|We enjoyed this so much and cannot wait for the next one to become available.  The item we bought was in great condition.
B000JIHP88|1.0|The mobile stopped rotating after a month even I did not turn it on very often! ( just couple of times per day) very disappointed!
B001FB4W0W|5.0|We are so hooked on this show now.  We had been curious from the media hype and now we can't wait for the next one.  We are invested in all the characters.
1401216676|5.0|The hardcover edition of this is awesome. The art in it is cleaned up and looks like it was published recently. Great buy
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I like the big display on the whole kindle screen. Works as expected with the really nice extra of the history display.
B001P1MZNI|5.0|I am amazed at the sound quality of this recording, given how and when it was recorded.  Very entertaining.  Features most of Sinatra's big hits, along with some of hit comedy.  Count Basie's orchestra sounds amazing as well.  If you like Sinatra, pick this live album up.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is really fun.the only downside is that you have to choose your or tilt as your movement. Tilt is too inaccurate for me so I use touch. But when you use this method, you can't really see your shark since your singer's right over it. Otherwise this game is great. Super fun and not soliciting game that forces you to buy things to progress. One of the best games I've played on kindle.
B0000062S0|1.0|Thank god for \\"Celebration Day\\", so \\"Walking Into Clarksdale\\" is not the final recording of Page/Plant. No way around it, this one is an underdeveloped effort that does not measure up as a finished product. It is almost as if they stopped working on it because they themselves became bored with it, and just left it that way. It is not as if the material itself is bad, as Plant earned a grammy on a similar outing with Allison Krauss, but it is just that poorly executed. I, myself, have been a die hard Zep and solo Plant fan forever and own almost every recording I can find, including interviews. But after only the second listen, just in case I didn't \\"get it\\" the first time, I was actually offended by it and sold it to a second hand CD shop.
1250010403|5.0|Second  of series - Every bit as good as the first book in the series Titled - Only Time will tell
B009E3EXMU|5.0|Led Zeppelin absolutely delivers the goods on what may be their final epitaph. They are tight, precise, and crisp, especially for a live album, which by the way, may be their most listenable officially released live effort. John Paul Jones provides an irresistibly driving bass and keyboard background. Jason Bonham does justice and was taking this seriously. He sets the Bonham family legacy in stone. Jimmy Page is somehow re-animated and in perfect form. Robert Plant surprises by being quite up to the difficult standard he himself set decades ago. I actually feel cheated that they they ultimately did not reunite for an album of new material and/or a tour after listening to this. There is no doubt that they were still capable of it after all these years. If you are wondering if it is worth getting the record AND the video: it is.
B001JRB16U|5.0|This movie is truly a classic.  The animation/live scenes are especially &#34;Disney&#34; great.  I think that because this movie is digitally mastered, the colors are much more vivid than the &#34;original&#34;.<br />This is really a great family movie that can be enjoyed by the young, old, and young at heart.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The last book of The Hunger Games trilogy was simply wonderful.  Lots of action, but what remains is the heartbreakingly sweet conclusion that brought me to tears.  The perfect ending to a perfect series.
B005D0RDKW|5.0|Their musicianship is captured here as they once again show why they are the BEST live band today!!  Peart is amazing and shows why he's the best drummer of ALL-TIME!!
0060763280|5.0|If you couldn't tell by all my reviews, I truly enjoy reading positive and inspirational books - Secrets of the Millionaire Mind is one of my favorites!
B004LP3AYI|5.0|This book is even better the second time around.  After reading the Legend of Magna Searus, I decided to reread this series.  It was a decision well worth it!
0060594888|5.0|The true entrepreneur can never get enough knowledge and insight for the daily grind of doing business!!  Start today by reading this book!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Heart rending yet so endearing you have to keep going. I like Death' s character and find him comforting. This brings to your face just a small bit of the suffering and emotions of the Holocaust yet it still overwhelms you at times. I recommend this to those that want to find their humanity again.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Another awesome read by Sylvia Day. When I read her books I'm either on treadmill, going to bed or just relaxing.
0783229526|5.0|Great movie, hard for some to follow. Johnny Depp is great as usual and as long as you don't think to hard and you pay close attention you'll get what's going on amazon shipped quickly and combined a separate movie order with this one which I thought was awesome. Very happy with this purchase.
B004YXE438|5.0|Wish it was free, but that's okay, I got it on free app day. The game is good and the puzzles are hard. Just wish the images were harder
B003VXMMTK|5.0|I had to watch all the episodes in one day!  Very good adapation of Tess of the Durbervilles with wonderful actors.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|Well, what can I say about Denzel!! He is the greatest African American actor of our generation! He's like our Sidney Portia! Loved the story line!! I am sure this is very up close/personal for a lot of Pilots!! Great movie! Anyone in the Aviation industry would enjoy this!
B00797MB0O|4.0|Others have given better positive reviews of this than I could write, but I want to also let others know that this is a film worth watching. I'm really unsure why there are so many negative reviews. For me this is one of those honest stories, that shows the bad and ugly side of human nature, in recognizable ways. The acting is quite intense, but comes across as very real -this film is really about the narrative. The main character goes from someone who is uncomfortably quirky, narcissistic and painful to watch in a superficial sense, to someone who is painful to watch because of the depths of their disfunction. The way Charlize Theron plays her character shows what a great actor she is.<br /><br />If you want a lighthearted film, don't watch it. But if you want to think a bit more about human nature, give it a whirl.
0670026603|5.0|I loved this book because it held my interest to the last page and it makes you think about how you would feel and accept something happening in your life you know you do not wish to happen.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|We love all of the Toca Boca games and this is no exception.  It's fun and great for learning.  Wish there were more toca boca apps available on Kindle.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|The author made you feel the fear and hopelessness that the boys at the orphage felt daily and also the asimplenpleasures that the present brought to each character.  Excellent twist at the end.  Enjoyed every page<br /><br />****
B0091REZMW|4.0|great game I would highly recommended to all takers. very intriguing great mistery all around I had to learn how to zoom in the spyglass
B0063IH60K|5.0|when I have time to kill this is great &amp; I can take it anywhere. great game &amp; it's free.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|This is my first Persona game and I wish I had played more now. Excellent story and writing and combat can be challenging.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I could hardly wait to get this to add to my set.  I have stayed glued to Masterpiece Theater on PBS prior to this release.  This is a wonderful saga full of intrigue and love both upstairs and down.  You really get to see what life was like during the first World War and thru the 1920's.  Costumes are beautifully done and High Clere Castle (Downton Abbey) is shown off to its very best.
1476733953|5.0|Love, peace, war, humanity. Looking back on this book, Words just can't serve justice. Its not often that a story can grab you in and keep your attention for hours at a time. Wool is one such exception.<br /><br />Wool is arguably the greatest sci-fi/post apocalyptic story of the decade. The characters are well developed and very relatable to. The universe itself is beyond words. Everything is described and set up just beautifully. Not to mention the thrill ride of a story this book offers.<br /><br />If I had to sum up Wool in one word, it would be along the lines of perfection.<br /><br />READ THIS BOOK!
B0091REZMW|5.0|I am so addicted!! I cant stop playing this game!! there are so many things happening all the time. it never gets boring....
B006ATJXQW|5.0|what in the world happened in the end?!? Somebody read this book and explain it to me!!! please!!! :))) i need to know what happened to mark and trina and alec and deedee!!! :))
B009KEN87O|4.0|Game plays well and is fun to boot!  Give it a try.  It's like stepping back in time to the 80's with a quarter in your hand.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|You can't beat 007 with Daniel Craig.  Adele's voice is awesome.  Definitely one of the best james bone movies out there
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I listen to a lot of music and it shows how much I have left..cause most times I switch off during listening time, which sucks!!!
B0042JIL2E|5.0|Wish they would tour the US. Catchy tunes and a beautiful voice. Check her out on Itunes if you had not heard her.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is amazingly well written. I have never in my life gotten so emotionally connected to characters. And I cried for at least the last 20-30 pages.. No, I take that back. I didn't cry.. I sobbed quite violently. And I continued sobbing for a good half hour... And just thinking about it now I'm probably going to start sobbing again. Amazing. Just amazing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing I could play it for hours.I recommend this game to everyone.good luck playing to all my fellow surfers
B009GEYX5E|3.0|It provides vibrant colors and clear images without a doubt but my only complaint is the waiting time. I know with the production halt of Polaroid film that The Impossible Project is making a big undertaking so my compliments to them and I'm sure as time goes on the waiting time will shorten. The price can be expensive but compared to actual polaroid film sold on amazon, this is the safer and most likely the more cost effective of the options.
B000FA5STS|4.0|I'm new to Baldacci and though my reviews have commented that his more recent books have not been as good, with disappointing endings and disjointed plot lines, I really enjoyed the Puller series. My only disappointment is that he has not continued the series.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Fun,quick and action packed,MORE fun than get'n hit by a subway!-) Tons of fun would recommend to all ages.....Out runs running man hands down,and definitely more kid friendly!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Wonderful graphics. Never lags. Works great on my Kindle fire HD. Keeps me entertained for hours. Highly  suggest for ages 7 and up.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Awesome game I would recommend this game to anyone to play its very adventurous the graphics and storyline are nice easy game play and tutorials help explain everything you need to know how to play
B009O5CLZY|4.0|Cool to see if you are a trailer for the Soviet union and the allies in denver Broncos and the allies in the Germans invade Iraq and Afghanistan to see if you are looking for a range..
B00B671W6W|4.0|If you're looking for a face-melting new Anthrax album, this isn't it. But if you want to hear the guys put their own spin on the music they grew up listening to, and helped make them into the musicians they became, then pick this up. I think it's great and you can feel how much fun they had playing these songs. It's an inexpensive EP that shows Anthrax doing something a little different. I think real music fans, and fans of Anthrax, will appreciate and want to add it to their collections.
B006H5120E|5.0|I love this movie and shipping was fast! I just don't like that to download the digital copy you have to have an Itunes account and they also ask for your credit card and that's a deal killer for me. So no digital copy for me! Paramount I just want my digital copy not an Itunes account..change this!!
B00BB8LTWI|5.0|The Daniel Craig movies have really injected new life into the James Bond franchise, but \\"Skyfall\\" is possibly one of the best Bond movies EVER.<br /><br />This movie is not just a brilliant Bond movie, or a brilliant spy thriller, but a brilliant movie in general -- beautifully filmed, combining the old-school James Bond formula with a very 21st-century brand of terrorism. But what truly elevates this beautiful movie is Sam Mendes' focus on both Bond and M, and the terrible costs of living their lives.<br /><br />A hard drive containing information on double agents is stolen in Istanbul, and Bond (Daniel Craig) nearly manages to get it back. But he's accidentally shot by Eve Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) and presumed dead. He's not dead, obviously -- but he uses this as a chance to retire to a tropical island.<br /><br />But then MI6 is hacked by a cyberterrorist, and their headquarters is blown up. Bond reappears in London to offer his services to his country again, but he's obviously not fit for duty -- physically or psychologically. Despite this, M (Judi Dench) sends him back out to find the cyberterrorists before more agents are killed.<br /><br />The trail leads him to Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem), a former agent who specializes in cyberterrorism. He blames M for his torture and mutilation, and is determined to destroy her career before killing her. Even capturing Silva isn't enough to stop him, and soon Bond must flee London with M to make a final stand against Silva.<br /><br />If there is a underlying question to \\"Skyfall,\\" it is this: Does an old-fashioned agent like James Bond belong in a world of cyberterrorism and individual extremism? Well, yes. The nature of conflict, evil and cruelty will never change, only the media through which they are spread. It's expressed in a lovely speech by M, which seems to say, \\"So what if it's the age of Bourne and Fast & Furious? Bond is timeless.\\"<br /><br />But Sam Mendes does sow some seeds of doubt about the \\"old guard\\" -- M is coming to the end of her tenure, and Bond is beginning to crumble from the physical and mental damage he's taken over the years.<br /><br />Mendes' direction is truly spellbinding. The action is gritty and often brutal, but set against backdrops of breathtaking beauty -- a nighttime apartment lit by glowing jellyfish, Bond drifting on a boat surrounded by luminous paper lanterns, and the creaky polished beauty of Skyfall itself. But he never lets us forget the brutality of the villain's ways, such as when the token Bond girl is brutally shot in the head.<br /><br />The movie also takes the chance to dip into the relationship between M and Bond. They have an untrusting, almost antagonistic relationship, with Bond knowing he cannot truly trust M, but also knowing that she does what must be done. And as he encounters Silva, Bond begins to see the creature he could choose to become, but his essential decency holds him back.<br /><br />Craig and Dench rule this movie, and both of them are blisteringly good -- they give stoic performances with strong emotions roiling under the surface. Craig's performance is particularly brilliant -- this is a Bond aching and riddled with scars, but he still has the strength he needs. He also has some deliciously sensual scenes with Naomie Harris. Shaving never looked so hot.<br /><br />But who can forget Javier Bardem? He also gives a glorious performance as Silva, a flamboyant cyberterrorist who hides his hate under a perpetually laughing face. Only when confronted by the woman he wants to kill does he show his true rage.<br /><br />\\"Skyfall\\" is not just a brilliant James Bond movie, but a brilliant movie -- in action, in writing, in direction and in character.

B004GHNIRK|4.0|Very hard read with all the French text and Hugo' s constant need to explain in detail every subplot and circumstance to the tenth degree, but the story was worth it.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Very very addictive. Just can't seem to get enough of it. Dam those evil little piggies. Great way yo pass some time.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|The Safe Haven is sad,happy,and a little scary. I would recommend this book. It is awesome, epic, cool, and amazing. Read this book!!!!!!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Dam those piggies all to hell. Lots of fun and very challenging. Need to kill several hours of doing nothing? This is a great way of doing it.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Excellent. It was heart wrenching but so real without being gross.  Also, it kept you guessing and finding out bit by bit while the whole story and the under layers develop. Sky and Holder meet at a grocery store and they feel an immediate connection, but Sky is scared of him because of the temper she sees in him and the rumors about him.  He perseveres in establishing a connection and she starts opening her heart and mind. Once you're happy and content reading their love story, and wondering where the story will go, then bam! You're hit with a blast of truth and you're taken on a roller coaster ride.  Very well written, smooth rhythm, excellent plot interconnections.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it!  of course its not as good as having your own horse but if you love horses this is the game for you!
B003MC5N28|5.0|Read this book when I was younger and now read it on my kindle. Definitely one  of my favorite books of all time!! Absolutely love it!!!
B00AG6Z92C|3.0|This album is okay. Bocelli’s vocals are in fine form, as usual.<br /><br />However, in terms of overall mood, I do miss the luxurious musical flourishes and other factors that made some of his older works unique, and which used to permit him to stand apart from even the guest artists who joined him on here.<br /><br />It might take me some time to get more into this one, too, though (and I’m a big Bocelli fan), but for now, I give this album a fair rating of three stars. Die-hard fans won’t mind, though.<br /><br />A better quality 2013 release is “All That Echoes,” by Josh Groban.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is one of those games you go back to day after day.  It really pays for you to do so also. You will live this for the whole family!
B009KEN87O|5.0|i love this game get it if u can i got it when it was free and its so good way better then i thought it would be. :) DNT KEEP READIN THIS GET IT
B009KEN87O|4.0|Aliens to avoid and shoot. Easy level is easy and the hard level is hard. Playing on a KF and touch<br /> control works well. No bugs.
B0086HGW42|5.0|Ed's music is on the same wavelength with Jason Miraz but there's a big difference still though. It's just that his music weights more on the harsh side of life, keeping it real, accompanying it with soothing tones. It's really something you should just listen when life brings you down or you feel a relaxing afternoon.
1934030597|5.0|Very well laid out , exilant details. Explanations are very through. Details and more details, good stuff. Quality book and more.
B005ELQVGW|5.0|Bjork ties the Earth, universe, ancestors, and the lower life forms (Virus, a great song, also check out the remix version by Mohawke on Bastards) as song elements. She is restrained here with the exception of Mutual Core's explosive chorus.  Moon, Cosmogony, and Solstice are delicate and moving. Biophilia is as mature as Vespertine and is a fully developed Medulla. Biophilia acknowledges Homogenic and is influenced by it, yet Biophilia is distinct, surging, forming (Dark Matter) as we perceive it through sound. Awesome.
B004I744AS|5.0|Love this app. it's perfect! it offers multiple definitions and pronunciations as well. beet free app I've found. worth the download.
0316044938|5.0|Like anybody, I love a novel that grabs me on page one, but The Lovely Bones was impossible to put down. At night when I'd fall asleep with the book on my face, I'd slip my bookmark in, set it on my nightstand, and say \\"delicious\\". I wanted to EAT the book.<br /><br />I loved the details in the characters description of \\"my heaven\\" and the sometimes wandering imagery given in the smallest details. That may seem redundant, but I simply admire the book so much. I wish I were the wordsmith this lady is because Ms. Sebold writes the way I thought when I was a younger girl. Thoughts and feelings I'd keep to myself for fear of seeming silly or insignificant. There was a great (and by great, I mean FANTASTIC) whimsy from the beginning to end that had me giggling, even though the subject matter was so horrid.<br /><br />Great storytelling. One of my top five, favorite books I've ever read. When I finished, I watched a trailer for the film that was made. I chose not to watch it because I knew I couldn't feel as strongly about it as the written word of Alice Sebold.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I enjoy this app!!! Stuff is in the craziest. places.  It challenges you by racing against the clock.  A game you can do pretty fast to advance to the next level.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Good game hhhbhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh human one time for like York Times and I want a manger and the garage sales and the yet I want the butt and shot at years and the beast rip education fun

B000LXH11C|5.0|great writer and producer meets great vocalist and arranger--object--fantastic music with depth of thought and melody.  this is the best colllection of these folks available.
B000WC3AJE|5.0|I always loved these movies, and my wife surprised me with this gift for my birthday! Lots of great extra features, and it's great to have the full original movies on disc!
0765350386|3.0|While Sanderson does create a world of magic and he is considered a New York Times bestselling author, I don't find him to be an exciting storyteller.  I found that this book of around 640 pages to be too long to tell the story, in truth it dragged and it could have lost at least 100 pages.  I think Sanderson's writing is overrated.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|No story, way too much corny dialogue. I enjoy Demille's sense of humor but this book was just filled with very, very corny humor. Needless to say, I did not find him funny. Let's hope Demille's next book has more meat and less &#34;fat&#34;.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|This show is just excellent, introduced my wife to it and she has fallen in love with it too.  It does have a lot of cursing and nudity but if you are not bothered by it, you should not pass up this show

1616550414|5.0|Any true zelda fan must own this book, its great art work and excellent binding make it look great in any collection.
B00457WZEI|4.0|I can see why they made it into a movie. The book is always better than the movie, great story to read.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Movie is just fantastic, while it does start slow remember this is just the start of a trilogy and sets up the next movie very well.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|highly addictive match three games but with lots of twists! can play for hours! lots of fun love it!! multiple play modes
B007MAETA8|5.0|It's a great album.  I've listened to it many times and will many times more.  What's up with the 5 more words?
B004W2UBYW|5.0|The book was assigned and I thought it was going to be painful. Obviously I have much to learn about the writing of Walter Isaacson. The way he presented Steve Jobs, brutally and honestly makes me feel as I actually knew Steve Jobs in person. I'm glad it wasn't sugar coated just to idolize an icon at the end of his life. It would have taken away from everything Steve Jobs did, good and bad. Thank you Mr. Isaacson for the great book.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|So now I have finished the series. I am experiencing a mix of happiness and sadness. Happy that Christian and Ana are together and happy, working things out. Sad because the books have concluded. While their story continues on and I know it will be a happy one, I am sad I will no longer be a part of it..like a really good friend who moved away. But I absolutely loved it! I loved watching Christian grow and change and love. I loved being a part of Ana as she learned how to love him and accept his love. The family was awesome, not perfect, but family. Taylor and Gail added very nice touches. I am just hooked by this love story... I will read these again and again. I've already decided to buy the hard copies so I can keep them close by. Thank you Ms. James for creating such a wonderful story and allowing me to share in it. I am a writer and I wish that my stories will capture the hearts of my readers as yours have captured mine. Loved it!!!!
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|I like this game its pretty fun. I reccomend getting this game if you need an app to waste your time. It's pretty fun except you get kinda bored after a while. But its cool.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like playing this game.  The downside is you have to have friends helping you and when all of them are roaming around its is messy and confusing.  There are too many creatures to banish and many features that are unexplained. Otherwise fun.
0802473156|5.0|We'd recommend this book for every relationship - the author bases his writing on years of counseling research, and his techniques, while simple, can be life and relationship changing!
0802473156|5.0|Reminds you of the big picture and all you can do to make your love one know they are appreciated.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Woah!I'm gonna try not to spoil this but it's so hard- in the end there are huge shockers! After Macon dies Lena perceives its her fault because she used the book. She slowly starts slipping away from Ethan trying or thinking that she's going dark.John breed and to Ridley get involved and suddenly Ethan,liv,and link go on a hunt 4 Lena knowing John is convincing her to go to the great barrier.when they get there a full out battle goes on!! I would definitely read this book! So worth it! Btw: liv works @the library and John is a demonish caster. READ AHEAD 4 SPOILERS.<br /><br />1- Macon isn't dead 2- Ridley turns mortal3- link turns into incubus- hope this helped!
B005LAIII0|5.0|Ang Lee does it again with this tale of a young man and his survival of a shipwreck only to be trapped on a lifeboat with a live tiger. I must admit that I am not at all familiar with the book, so I bring no book-laden expectations to the film. I saw this film strictly on the basis of a few trailers I saw that intrigued me. I love the visual splendor of the tiger, and the menace of the tiger at close quarters was absolutely terrifying. The great cosmic meaning of the film may have escaped me, but I  was transfixed at the sight of this beautiful and deadly beast and the young man playing a cat and mouse game with him in the lifeboat. I was well entertained, and am not worried if I should have had a profound insight and did not. The film is like a moving breathing work of art, and it captured my attention for every minute of it's length, which is something that I can't say about many films these days.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless by Colleen Hoover<br />★★★★★<br /><br />Sky had never been attracted to anyone before she met Dean Holder. The hopeless boy who swooped into her life and expressed a variety of different personalities and emotions. He ran hot and cold, and she couldn't figure him out. Meeting him triggered events that spiraled her life out of control, but she also needed him to regain control again. There was a lot more to Holder than his good looks and bad temper.<br /><br />I cannot put into words how amazing this book is and how much I love it. It deserves more than my highest rating of five stars. That is how epic this book is. I read this book in one sitting the first time and couldn't go to bed before I finished this beautiful, heartbreaking story. I was thinking about it continuously for days after until I re-read it again a few weeks later with my good friend Michele from A Belle's Tales. She was the one who told me about the book to begin with; and boy, am I glad! Hopeless is now one of my all-time favorite books. These characters and this story will stay with me for a long time; they have not let go of me yet.<br /><br />The story is breathtaking, and I had no idea where it was taking me; the author did an incredible job keeping me in the dark about what was going on. There were plot twists and turns I didn't see coming. Some things I was able to kind of figure out, but it still took me a while. The mystery and intriguing words kept me propelling forward, jumping off each cliffhanger chapter to get to the next. There were things I never saw coming and moments that made my heart stop.<br /><br />The author made me feel like I was part of this book; I felt every raw emotion and felt like the things the characters experienced, I experienced. The author's writing and style was amazing, and I really can't wait to read more of her work.<br /><br />This was a work of art, perfectly put together and done flawlessly.<br /><br />The author recently announced that she would be writing Hopeless in Holder's point-of-view, and all I can say is I can't flipping wait. This is a book that I will definitely re-read again in the future, and I highly recommend it.she would be writing Hopeless in Holder's point-of-view, and all I can say is I can't flipping wait.

B007URVZJ6|5.0|This easy to follow guide is a must have if you are considering publishing a book for Kindle. A lot of my friends have Kindles and I recently formatted a 300 page book in less than a week. I give it five stars for being user friendly, and the explanations with instructions were very informative. I loved it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|THIS APP IS SO GOOD! This app is a great app for people of all ages who love animals. I let my mom play on my kindle and she played this game all. Day. Long. I am very happy with the graphic quality and it actually shows the horse moving.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love it.really fun and entertaining. reminds me of a nintendo ds game. recommend this game to all ages. so fun
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it is sucked a awesome game I play it all the time that is why I would say get the app it is sooooooo cool
B008RTE08E|5.0|Great to finally see a version of this with good picture and sound. Even though it has it's corny spots, it's still fun to watch.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|Very good mouse for what I paid. I came from using a Logitech MX518 and the adjustment curve was minimal. Works, tracks and feels much like any of the Logitech MX510, MX518, or G400. Has adjusting pretty lights... yay (sarcasm). I love the thumb button placement also. I used all the weights it came with and its just a smidge heavier than the MX518 with them, but I like mice on the heavier side. My only complaint is using the mouse wheel as a button is a little hard. To click it once in a while is manageable but if you have to hold it down for any length of time (as in Neverwinter Nights Two to rotate the screen/camera), it's VERY difficult and even awkward at times. Other than that, its a surprisingly decent mouse for the price. Software is very user friendly. Its a good FPS mouse but just OK for MMOs imo and VERY good for general use.<br /><br />EDIT: I recently re-installed World of Warcraft and none of the extra buttons on this mouse work with the game, which was a main appeal.. to use with MMOs. Ive installed all the latest drivers and used the Mouse software, but with no luck. Ive emailed the company and theyve told me to do what I already tried and no other emails were sent yet. My initial review was 4 stars but went down to 3. I'll add more and edit if I get this fixed.<br /><br />Edit, Edit; As they posted, they had a fix for it. A little involved if youre not PC saavy but still doable. Thier customer service stayed in contact via email and finally just called me we figured it out. Very happy overall with purchase. If I can get one on sale, I may get another as it may be my new standard as a mouse.
B0025KVLVA|5.0|After re-watching the Anthology, I needed one more song and found it here. Good service and timing and quality and price.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The book was filled with twists and turns it kept me on my toes and i definitely didn't see what happened in the end.
0345535421|4.0|Excellent sequel to A Game of Thrones. In this volume Martin has dialed up the fantasy a little, even including an intriguing dream/visions sequence. Martin also dials up the brutality. The only drawback is that the feeling that the story as a whole doesn't really move too far forward in this book.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|It was a very good movie. I don't know why the man blew it to get off free. I would have just stuck with the first story to get out of something that I didn't do.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|price was reasonable. pre-ordered and arrived as promised. just sorry there was not more episodes as we watched over the first weekend. we will watch again.

B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is a down to earth, honest and touching look inside the life of a warrior, yes on of the best, but it is also a glimpse into the battles they face both home and abroad.  Thank you Chris and Taya for your courage and conviction.  God Bless.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|I've been using Avast for years on my home PC's. It is the ONLY A/V I have found that has absolutely no significant impact on resources and  It works and it appears the mobile version is no exception !
0194236196|5.0|This book is an excellent resource for teaching English Language Learners. I have taught it to levels 1, 2, 3, and this unit is always a hit. The book is written well, interesting to the kids, and good for advanced beginners or low intermediate students learning English. I highly recommend this book for ESL teachers. It is very engaging and lends itself well to thought provoking discussions, various reading strategies, and writing prompts. Great teaching tool.
B00BWJ7LYG|3.0|I just don't see the 4 - 5 stars here. It was really a big letdown from The Lord of the Rings trilogy. It had it's moments but that's about it. IMO the entire movie could be shortened to about 60 minutes without losing a thing, in fact it would be an improvement. Honestly, 3 stars and I struggled with that.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game was the only thing I missed after swearing off facebook.  Very happy to see the kindle version. Works very well with only the occasional slowdown.  Yes, there are microtransactions in the game, but you do not need to buy diamonds to play, your progression will just be slower without them.
B00BHMF578|4.0|If you are under 40 or over 40 and haven't been paying attention it may be a 5 star movie. Otherwise, not so much because though it's based on true events it's not REALLY a true story which makes it slightly less entertaining. Canadians may rate it much lower !
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|Read the back of this book in a bookstore and wanted to read it years ago. Picked up it up from Amazon a week ago. This is a very intriguing read. There are some slow chapters but ultimately it grasped my attention and emotions. I recommend this book.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I've never read anything quite like this series. It's fearless, terrifying, riveting, and lots of fun.  I don't want to spoil anything, but I can't wait to get into book 4 and see what happens next.
1451695195|5.0|This book introduced me to a profound truth that I have always known in my heart. I am grateful that this book has become a best seller as the more people to read it the better will become our world.
B000FA675C|5.0|This book and the other Robert Langdon adventures are the best books I've ever read. I can't wait to get Inferno!
B008HK3XYK|1.0|Not at all what I expected after ordering a cover for my kindle fire. Very poor quality. Would not recommend to anyone.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is progressively challenging .  I've enjoyed it so far and the graphics are nice and chrisp. It's worth it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|when I first saw this app I thought it won't be what I need.  It is so easy to work and you will not lost your answer unless you clear it out. keep up the good work.
B0094K1IPI|5.0|Simply a great movie. Has everything you need. Has been my favorite since seeing it in theaters. HD Looks amazing.
B000002LAC|5.0|This is an old CD.  I think they made it in the early 1990s. If you like these three singers, you will love the CD.
B00000F14B|5.0|Awsome movie oldie but goodie Family could watch over and over again Great Musical to purchase for a collectors collection
B009NQKPUW|2.0|Very slow moving, raised more questions than answered questions. A waste of time, money, and a good bowl of popcorn and a coke.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|I like it a bit a addictive. Wish it was a result free game t hat you didn't have use as actual money to progress beyond certain points.
B0041VV03A|2.0|This movie was just barely watchable.  Too dark to see anything about 50% of the time. Although the message of the plot was very clear
B0074MZSWW|4.0|I think this young woman and her band members have an exciting time ahead for them.  She is exquisitely talented.  Some of the songs on this album seemed kind of indistiguishable from one another.  But I'm glad I have the album and I listen to it regularly.
B0047SF41G|3.0|This movie was not great but it was good.  A few of the major stars were under used and under developed.
B0068FYZIO|5.0|Schindler's List is a black and white movie based on a true story about the horror of the Holocaust. Schindler a businessman from Poland started a company making dishes and cookware. Schindler also brings in a partner/accountant named Itzhak to help him with his new business. Schindler then staffed his plant with Jews who were unpaid, so he had a fully staffed business with free workers. The Jews he brought in to work for him were the same Jews that had been forced into Krakow's Ghetto by Nazi Troops. However some Jews did not mind working for Schindler because they felt this could prolong their life for atleast another day. When the Jews were forced in Krakow's ghetto, many of them were killed, men, women, and children, it did not matter to the Nazi troops. By 1942 all of Krakow's Jews were in the Plascow Forced Labor Camp, which was led by Amon. Amon was a horrible person who would get drunk and randomly shoot the Jews that were working, from the balcony coming off of his bedroom. Schindler continues to use Jews in his plant and continues to request more and more Jews, as he finally came to senses that what is going on is wrong. He kept requesting Jews in an effort to save as many Jews as he could from the Nazi Troops and from Amon. Schindler ended up saving over one thousand Jews but in return lost his whole empire and business.<br /><br />This movie is related to my world religions class right now because we are learning about the history, rituals and modern times of the Jewish, and unfortunately the Holocaust is an important part of Jewish history.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|While I liked the book; it was an \\"easy\\" read as the story flows well... it felt like something a hopelessly romantic teen would list as their favorite-of-all-time.<br />It is sad. I felt the author was able to describe grief well. I did find myself wondering if he sat writing with a thesaurus in his lap as EVERY OTHER WORD isn't the most commonly used conversational lingo. I wasn't baffled or anything, just wondering \\"who actually speaks this way?\\" Am I out of touch with true hipsterhood? Maybe. I don't say \\"flummoxed\\".
B00BFHZOCG|5.0|Awesome remakes, Sounds almost like the originals. 5 stars.. Through the Persistence of Time Anthrax is Among the Living and still kickin it after all of these years. Peace!!!!!!
B009KEN87O|5.0|I absolutely love this game. If you are/were s fan of Space Invaders you will love this game. Much fun
B007ONSLLQ|4.0|Great album, a must have, There music kicks ass. Cant wait for there next album..Hope they come to TC soon I will go see them in concert.
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|The pictures are amazing, and there's beautiful animation throughout.  It's also a really fun game, and it's as easy - or hard- as you want it to be. I especially like that it's not timed and I can take my time trying to figure things out. You can also turn on or off the hints, depending on how much you want to think about what you're doing. Well worth the money.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this game is so good my friends and I talk about our high scores all the time this is a really great game
B008220C38|3.0|The acting is ok, costumes out of this world but it is not the best version of Anna Karenina I have ever seen.
0060730552|5.0|You can not put this book down. A true story of the strength of the human spirit. The will to keep going no matter what the odds.<br />If you're in a tough place in your life right now, read this book. It will give you strength, hope and bring you to realize that it's<br />not about what happens to you in life, it's how you handle it that counts. This is a Rocky type of inspiration. We all have this<br />type of strength in us. ALL OF US... Most amazing, it's a true story!!!!!!!!!!
B004HW7JH4|5.0|Excellent acting, interesting story, will definitely buy the next season if there is another one in the works. Recommend it to everyone
B007N8RULO|4.0|I really like the tool bar hidden at the bottom. That &#34;undo&#34; button and &#34;hint&#34; button are easy to get to!  Would recommend. Much better than some free games I've downloaded.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Love the story line, excellent acting, interesting, surprising, cannot wait to see the next season. Lots of adventure and imagination
B009GEAPYW|4.0|Part1 was good I enjoyed watching it.  But part2 was EVEN BETTER.  Part 1 is perfect setup to part two.  If you like Batman you will enjoy them both.
B002SJIO4A|5.0|This movie has to rank as one of the top handful of sci-fi movies ever made.  With the low budget, unknown actors, they still pulled it off.  An outstanding film.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|The second season of Game Of Thrones is amazing. High production values, solid storyline and great characters. I love the blu-ray edition with all the extras and the beatiful packaging. Highly recommended!
B0050PYNN0|3.0|Not the greatest flick ever made, they will not have to wait in line for those pesky Academy Awards.  The minotaur definately needed to have more screen time
B003TQKVGU|5.0|This book contains very profound stuff. Once one read this book at least twice with an open mind, can understand better human behavior and miracles in the Bible.
B000P0J09C|5.0|If this movie stopped before everyone went to Vietnam, I would still give it 5 stars.  R. Lee Ermey's performance as the drill seargent was spot on and definately reminded me of my time in boot camp and long time ago.  He should be at least received a nomination for best supporting actor.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Thought it was going to be a teen read but it hooked me in with the surprising twists and turns. Usually I am very good at guessing what is going to happen but the book did a 'sixth sense' to me and caught me by surprise. Hard to do these<br />Days SO great effort.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|My previous favorite made for TV series was Deadwood, but it has now been replaced.  This is by far the best thing that HBO has done, with the blockbuster production values, huge set pieces, fine acting.  The Battle of Blackwater Bay has all the look and feel of a 100 million movie.  Bravo HBO, can't wait for season 3 to start
B0083SBMBM|5.0|This  a great mmovie to purchase.  The kids will love it.  I've even watch it several time with and without the kids.<br /><br />Dave
B007REV4T8|5.0|I thought this was the best of the Bond films so far.  We finally get a little backstory on Bond.  The new very subdued Q,  M was great.
B000PY6BBI|5.0|One of the best romanic movies I ever watched.  The actor and actress play the best parts and convey the story line very well.
B0034G4P1W|3.0|Not bad for claymation, got lots of chuckles, &#34;The pig is a kind of fruit?&#34; A case study on overcoming adversity
B005C8ENI0|3.0|seen better. I like the actor but the story line was not a good part for the actor.  Would not pay for it.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love games in which I can raise/evolve creatures. I love dragons. In Dragon Story I get the best of both worlds.
B004GUSG4M|3.0|I enjoyed this book but figured most of it out pretty quickly so was disapppointed at the end.  I was hoping I was wrong and that it would have a twist instead of the obvious.
B0090SI3ZW|4.0|Great action movie.  Interesting story concept.  Russell Crowe plays a very different part than we are used to seeing him in.
B009LK6JS2|4.0|Good game but not many aircraft. They should make more aircraft light commercial and private and make the graphics better.
B000FC1MM8|5.0|Great read. Did it in a day. I'm so vested now in Bosch's life.<br />Can't wait for the next chapter to begin.
B009ERK1T0|5.0|I love Deftones. I have for years. This is one of the bands my husband and I have been listening to together since we started dating. I bought this for him for his birthday. All in all we're very happy with the purchase.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|Enjoy the writing style and the action.  I have always loved a mystery and these a great ones.  Looking forward to reading the rest!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I liked this app because this is one of my favorite games to play on facebook. I can now play even when I am not on my laptop.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|Liked comparing to the TV show.  Enjoy the writing style and how fast it moves.  I usually read at night and this is a good fit for before sleep.  Fun to think about!
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I read the graphic novel prolly course why a lot of other ppl too and I kept hearing how diff it is to the show. So I started it and have been captivated!!!
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|it is the best game ever I royalty recomend this app if all you pep lover's are out there thank you thank you very much oh sorry I can get a little caried away.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This offers the solitude games I was looking for. Very addictive and helps pass time on trios or waiting at Dr office
B004G600A4|5.0|Cute movie, typical Disney, nice story-line. My 3 year-old absolutely loves it and is slightly obsessed with all things Rapunzel now!
B003ITZBVI|5.0|WOW this was incredible.  I bought this based on the reviews and they weren't wrong.  Very well written and directed.  The action was very well done, very cinematic.  This was a little edgier than I was anticipating (not for little kids - murder, sadistic beatings, mention of drug dealing, etc.) but very enjoyable.  It also comes with a whole lot of special features including interviews about the Robin character, 4 of Timm's favorite Batman animated episodes, and a Jonah Hex short (which again is not for little kids - depicts murder and prostitutes).
B0061QD88S|5.0|One of the less scary movies for the toddler set. I had forgotten the story line, but it was perfect.
B00AEBB9EG|5.0|Three days of the Condor goes into the politics that was happening in Argentina, Chile or Venezuela. A great movie that used some history that was happening then and moved to somewhat a conclusion of how leaders plan to take over nations, also being used now. Great insight of movie that foretold some of the future.
B002VHI8J0|3.0|I bought the book after reading that an interesting movie based on it was coming out soon. The movie sounds like a bit of an epic so I figured that I'd get ahead of the game and read the book to get an understanding of the story.<br />Although it does boast a clever and unusual writing style, and a fairly engaging read it can be a bit of a slog at times. I haven't finished it yet, and to be honest if it weren't for the upcoming movie I probably wouldn't. I'm hoping the end makes up for my perseverance.
0848817540|5.0|A Passage to India is a classic novel- well-constructed, genuinely human, and meaningful. I found the book to be a quick read, even the most mundane points were extremely readable. This is due, I believe, to the manner in which Forster captures the interesting dynamics and contradictions of human relationships. Thus he does not rely upon a number of absurd and exciting occurrences that drive many novels. This is pointed at rather directly in the book itself,<br /><br />\\"Most of life is so dull that there is nothing to be said about it, and the books and talk that would describe it as interesting are obliged to exaggerate, in the hope of justifying their own existence. Inside its cocoon of work or social obligation, the human spirit slumbers for the most part, registering the distinction between pleasure and pain, but not nearly as alert as we pretend. There are periods in the most thrilling day during which nothing happens, and though we continue to exclaim 'I do enjoy myself' or 'I am horrified' we are insincere. 'As far as I feel anything, it is enjoyment, horror' - it's no more than that really, and a perfectly adjusted organism would be silent.\\"<br /><br />Not violating his own declaration, Forster weaves a tale in colonial India that is exciting and powerful without feeling artificial.
B0060MYM3S|4.0|I hoped the storyline would advance faster and farther. Still high quality and worth watching.  I am hoping season 3 will provide more progress
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app. It is easy to use and works great on my kindle. So far I haven't had a single problem.
B00AB0AR2U|5.0|This movie is good,in violence,action and killing for the mature,adult and fun viewers. It's a good movie in fighting,killing and blooding as other previous ones. More fighting between good people,bad people and killing zombies. Not for the family,children and minor.
B008VBYN80|5.0|It is very interesting. The graphics are good. It is also very interactive. Anyone could play this. It is really fun
B009HEJXFS|4.0|This movie is a good movie,for the family on science fiction with best actors. it's a fun,joyfulness and memorable watching with family. It's about the past and future when there is always family with love. Highly recommend,for family.
B00AFEY354|5.0|This was better than I expected it to be. Wanted to see Emma in something new, and every young actor was great. The story was realistic and very engaging. I think it was WAY overlooked at the box office.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft has opened a whole new world for me (literally!). Since my computer can't handle the pc version this is the next best thing. I spend a lot of free time playing it and it hasn't even gotten the slightest bit boring. Usually I almost never buy an app or game on my kindle that's over 99&cent; but this was totally worth it! I suggest it to any one with any kind of imagination or ingenuity.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|This case is very durable!!

B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game so many rooms and different challenges just wish energy didn't run out I could play all day
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|This is a great game it makes you think and remember your last steps to finish a puzzle that you encountered before. Great story but starting to think who makes these games. Out of all the ones that I've played there is always a female lead character. There's nothing wrong with that but would like to see how one is played with a male lead character since I'm a guy.
B0080SZ0V8|3.0|it was pretty good the first chapters in.  the puzzles were too easy then they got a bit challenging which was nice but before you are half way in,  the games start repeating and it is just very boring once that starts.  I suggest just playing the free part Bc not too long after that it will start repeating.  very disappointing after a promising start.
1851243968|5.0|I primarily bought this book because Mary Shelley and her book Frankenstein play a part in my first novel. I haven't read the entire book yet but enough to solve my own personal puzzle re Frankenstein. I loved the story, but not the writing, blaming it on it's being written long ago.<br /><br />Now I know better.<br /><br />Mary Shelley's book, Frankenstein, was severely tampered with: first by Percy Shelley,then by her publishers, and finally by her father! Mary Shelley's earliest untampered with version is finally brought to light here and it reads wonderfully! It's not wordy or archaic as the versions that had Shelley's, the publisher's, and her father's hand in it.<br /><br />Now the author's version needs to be printed up on it's own and attention brought to her original version. It was mentioned that the very earliest versions have disappeared but many an author does that. However the difference is so striking and her writing so much better than what we came to know as her story, it's obvious that Mary Shelley's version is the best!<br /><br />I thank the Bodleian Library, University of Oxford, and the editor Charles E. Robinson for this timely book.<br />Best Regards, Jacqueline Stigman  [[ASIN:0988877007 From Darkness: Book One - AWAKENING (Volume 1)]]

B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|Games is OK. You can only go so far before you have to buy the full version.  Need to give you more levels  to get you hooked
B000N6U0E2|5.0|every salesperson should watch this! This movie would be 'required viewing' for my people if I was a sales manager.
B000W22NOW|5.0|...bought this to replace all the prior versions I've lost since the 80s; on cassette, CD, etc.  Even since its release in 1983, it's still head-and-shoulders above most pop music of today in its sophistication, craftsmanship, moving emotional themes, and original production.  No wonder the style, lyrics and songwriting have influenced and been imitated by so many other artists.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|I give this game 4 stars because when you use up the lives you have to start from the 1st level. Even if you are on level 10 but I do like everything else about this game. I would totally recommend this to anyone who would like to try it. It is AWESOME.
B003K1EYM6|4.0|great item alot cheaper than buying at apple or best buy great item and would purchase again if I needed to
1250006341|3.0|I thought it would be more about the storyline.  it is a rather good look at life during the early 1900's.

0553582461|5.0|Robin Hobb is a fantastic writer. The stories connect well and I haven't found any plot holes or unresolved mysteries except the ones you want to find in a fantasy series, the ones that keep you reading to find out what happens next. I look forward everyday to the time I can spend reading her books. Buy any of her series and enjoy!
1419705849|4.0|great book easy to read and very informative would purchase again if I lost the book great book keep in safe place don't loan out to anyone you will not get back
193413712X|4.0|[...]<br /><br />I didn't have any expectations when I opened the first page of Tinkers.  I found the book on Amazon by accident and put it on my Wish List on a whim.  I can reasonably say I will never forget it.<br /><br />Three quarters of the way through the book, which is short, the most I could say about Tinkers is that it was bleak.  (For some reason, reading Tinkers made me feel what I did when I watched The Tree of Life; although, The Tree of Life is far more abstract).  Tinkers seemed for a time to be traveling down the well-trodden paths of most modern literature, broken family, futile lives, etc., but Tinkers became something much, much more.  I stuck with it, just like I do for almost every book I start reading, and I am very glad I did.<br /><br />The book relies heavily on themes of death but also, and by natural extension, explores themes of life and living.  Tinkers doesn't make you feel 'happy'; rather, I felt sadness when reading it.  However, I did feel something, genuine and real.  That's my greatest compliment for the book.  It got into me, my mind and soul.  I thought about it, wondered over it, debated with myself, and was grateful for the experience.  As I continue to think about various episodes in the book, I start to see it as more life-affirming than I originally believed.<br /><br />I'm glad I read Tinkers.  It came as a surprise to me, especially since my initial perceptions of it were poor.  In a strange and somewhat unexplainable way, it's a part of me now.  When I discuss books with others, I think Tinkers will be part of the conversation.  It made me feel, which made me feel enlightened, which is why I read.<br /><br />[...]
B009M588K8|4.0|Recommended reading for anyone interested in our military and those that serve.  Navy seals are extrordinary people.  It should be published in paperback.
B009GXHOW4|1.0|I had to give it one star because I couldn't give it 0 stars so many things wrong with this app!!!!!
B0085KGHI6|2.0|This show would have been alot better had Mick just sat there and watched Muddy do his thing. Keith and Ronnie added to it and had the kind of fun that students have when they are learning something they love from a Master.<br />I'm a huge Mick fan but that night he was just too silly as he was on basically that whole tour they were on at the time of this show in Chicago.<br />Mr Jagger was just trying too hard and you can see him wildly smiling at Muddy for no apparent reason along with the fake 'gum chewing' thing that he's done a few times that I've seen.<br /><br />There were some great moments at that show but without Mick overdoing it, it could have been a fabulous 'Muddy' show.<br /><br />Sorry Mick. Nobody does what you do nearly as good as you do but that night you should have stayed in your seat and had a couple of Guiness Stout's. The anticipation of the crowd would have been more of a legend.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is the best app ever!!! I love it!!! I have had this app before, until it got deleted, and I loved it!!! I Ann a big horse person, do this app was pretty for me.
B000022TSY|3.0|I have mixed feelings. It's an interesting movie. Positives are beautiful country and good music and some entertaining parts.<br />negatives are nothing really happens. it drags on...
B004GJXQ20|5.0|And then I thought - why so big, so many names to remember, so many books, future dust, lost space... and that is why i thought about kindle.<br />Ina
B004VMUS9G|5.0|so many different options.U can set it to where u have to solve a math problem to make the alarm stop going off...LOL.. great app. Totally recommend it!
B007V4530A|3.0|Some interesting thoughts on the specific venue of TED presentations. There are other books that are more relevant to most presenters..read those instead.
0062238310|5.0|It was amazing!  I give it 10 Stars.  Loved reading it and hope they print the following seasons as well.  Thank you so very much Mr. Fellowes for sharing your wonderful work.
B00BESM14U|5.0|Well written characters and well acted. Heart warming story of coming of age. A good couples movie.for a relaxing night.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|dont pay just play  not bad for a freebee..  maybe ill pay later lol<br />love to kill time with this game  love to eat stuff  sharks are fun
B00BF11STU|1.0|I've watched many movies in my life.  This is one that makes you yawn and fall asleep until the end.  Lots of torture and screaming AND blahh blah blah.  It really is like what was inside that terrorist's pants.  F-
B009VYF5E2|5.0|I had watched most of the series prior to this purchase, however after the purchase I was able to see shows i had missed while the series was on TV.  Loved it and will hate to see it end in the final season yet to come.  Good family entertainment, well worth the purchase.
B008N9AASC|5.0|I purchase very few DVDs, but Samsara and Baraka were two MUST purchases for me.  It's impossible to take in all the beauty and thought provoking images in either of these films in 1, 2 or even 3 viewings.  For me, each viewing is a new experience.  I ALWAYS see something I missed in previous viewings.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Can't wait for the next season, was well worth the purchase.  Maggie Smith is wonderfully entertaining.  Any and every one will love this series it is a classic in the making, in my opinion.
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|Well, I think the title says it all. I finally had to give up and turn it off. It was supposed to be a comedy, but there was nothing funny-and I am known to have a VERY dark sense of humor.  I expect this might be enjoyed if you are looking for a &#34;hey, at least my life isn't that bad&#34; kind of flick.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|What a season! Lots of changes happening. I can't wait for the next season! It will be interesting now that Matthew is gone!
B0085A9J18|5.0|Sad to realize movies like this come far and few inbetween. I enjoyed the movie thoroughly. It satisfied my appetite for destruction, fight sequences with much thought, flare, and no wire work.
B0079J26TI|4.0|I enjoyed the Klemperer performances of the Hebrides Overture and the Schumann and Mendelsson 4th Symphonies.  The Mendelssohn 3rd was another matter, as these ears are used to a brisker approach (e.g. The DECCA/London LSO under Peter Maag). The tempi preferred by Klemperer sounded almost perverse by comparison. After a couple of listens, although I still found the tempi to be perverse they at least sounded more interesting. The sound, while slightly but still noticeably improved over that of the remasterings of the early 1990s of this 1960 source material, did not compare to my ears to the DECCA/Maag recording from the same period. Not even close....which makes one appreciate the importance of microphone type and placement, as well as the vision of the original recording producer.  Still, at this price not to quibble too much as these recordings are unlikely ever to sound better when auditioned in a good room with fine equipment.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|They captured the spirit and emotion of the musical! The scenery was awesome, and the singing fantastic!<br /><br />I was at first skeptical about Russel Crowe, but in the end he delivered!<br /><br />All around well done!
B0084I9QIW|5.0|This DVD is just WONDERFUL! I have owned a VERY bad copy of this which was recorded from TV back in 1988 I guess and deteriorated over the yrs...it is just wonderful to have this footage in mint condition from Michaels personal videographers! Another gem for any Michael Jackson fan!
B0015FHDRW|3.0|The CD and the music is what I wanted. However, there should be more pictures of the pack since it doesn't come in hardcase neither came with a book list of pics or the lyrics. So is necessary to have more real pictures of the disc and a detailed description of how it comes.
B007MDB548|5.0|Tinker Bell finding her sister she didn't know she had.  Great story and will be watching many more time with my grandkids.<br />Product arrived as scheduled no problems
B009KEN87O|5.0|Fun way to pass the time. And as the free app of the day why not.  The great crappy graphics you remember as a kind for us 80's babies
B006M4F67A|5.0|I got hooked on Mahjong several years ago. I would play it on my computer constantly, more often than solitaire. I had to remove some stuff from my Fire to be able to download this, but it was worth it.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|The descriptions of Jamie's loneliness and 86's cruel experiences were so real that it became painful to read.  You grieve and hope with the characters.  She is a powerful writer.<br />Lannesadler@sol
B00395ZYVS|4.0|This was a quick and easy read that got my interest immediately and kept it throughout. It also provided good insights into Indian history and culture.  I definitely recommend it!
B009O2XY12|2.0|I can't figure out the secret to playing this and I gave up.  I'm sure it is easy but I became frustrated with it.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I absolutly love this app. It's really relaxing and fun to raise your own dragons. I play it 24/7 because it's so addicting and I highly recommend it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I enjoy this game but I wish there were some instructions telling you what the different coins do, what are dozer dollars, what are the silver and/or gold coins for.
B00B23O96A|5.0|Eric Clapton really brings each track out in a very blues and story telling that is relates to the ole blues legends. GREAT CD
B00942X8PY|4.0|This puzzle game got difficult quickly.  I like it a great deal but I have to be completely engaged to solve some of them.
B00AGKH7K0|5.0|The Til your river runs dry CD flow with great verse and rhythm, and a tribute to BO Diddy stands with memory of his time. Eric perform with style through out the CD. I recommend that every track should be heard.
B00846WWVM|4.0|My grandson's really like it they want to play it for hours.  I like that they are learning to problem solve.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|Lee Child does it again. A nice mix of suspense, action and romance. Can't wait to read the next Jack Reacher episode.
B0055PGUYU|1.0|I was really hopeful that this book would take an in-depth look at habits, how they developed and how this could be useful in business. Unfortunately, the book wastes a lot of time and a lot of words going way too in-depth on case studies rather than really talking about habits. This is a great book for an undergrad or graduate student looking for case studies for a paper, but isn't worth more than $5 for anyone else. Once you discover the formula for creating a habit, you've reached the pinnacle point of the book.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I loved this book!! I decided to read it after seeing previews for the movie, that was all I knew about it.  The book was very beautifully written. The story was nothing like what I had expected, much more to the plot. It is a great story of Faith, endurance and appreciation for life.
B008XCJ03K|5.0|It took a few listenings but I now play it often. Sometimes difficult to understand the wording but the music's fine.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|As I have always loved Josh's music, I spend hours listening to him.  Now, this CD is , by far the best.  My Bose and Josh bring the  peace to my otherwise disturbed frame of mind,  I hope he never stops creating CD's.  With each new release, that one is the best.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is a beautifully shot nature documentary.  It is informative and well narrated.  The combination of HD and surround sound is encompassing.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|The soothie pacifier we received from the hospital is the only one my baby will take, but he's always losing it in his carseat when I can't stop and give it back to him.  The Wubbanub is perfect because it gives him the paci he loves and allows him to hold his 'toy' and he's learning to put it back in his mouth by himself.
B005CRQ4OW|4.0|The best book ever read in my life. This book is funny . I love it. Totally BUY THIS book .
B001DEXDNI|5.0|This is simply music at its best! It has it all: dance music, romantic music, relaxed stuff as well... Just a really good buy.
B00BRR66SA|4.0|first off...let me just start this review by saying that i do not own any of JT's previous work...ANY...just in case any of you wondered if im just another fan of his writing a good review...i honestly never listened to him until i purchased this record...and i gotta say that im really impressed with this album...alot of people have given this the cold shoulder for numerous reasons (mostly dumb and ridiculous)...i honestly see very little wrong with it...10 tracks is a start but that is considered nit picking if you ask me...the length of the tracks should not be an issue either...yet people slam this record as a result...just a few things to note...but to each one their own right...that's why im writing this review...and you should stop reading this and just buy the album already...its a very solid release by Justin...Kudos from me...<br /><br />for those that just want the standout tracks...the only two tracks i have yet to get into are<br />Spaceship Coupe and Let The Groove Get In...the other 8 are 5 stars for me...get this album...
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|I didn't see it in the theater but bought it due to it winning some Oscars.  A beautiful film and one of the few films I've seen that actually truly benefits from 3D.  Highly recommended!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game it's better than all other games. You can fee, groom, ride,enter tournaments and all sorts of things.
B008JFUNPK|3.0|I won't give away any spoilers, so don't worry about that. The Croods is the most visually stunning animated feature I think I have ever seen, and the 3D was equally superb, so 5 stars on that front. The voice-actors were very good as well and deserve to be recognized for their work. It was the writing behind the movie that left me bored and uninspired. Sort of like the Ice-Age series, The Croods is the story of a journey to a safe zone after the family of cavemen's \\"natural habitat\\" becomes unstable due to out-to-get-you seismic activity. Always with the earthquakes. However, unlike the Ice-Age franchise, The Croods lacked entertaining, plot-helping side stories. It's the family's journey and some pride issues with the clan's father figure (voiced by Nicholas Cage). That's pretty much it. Predictable. Yawn.<br /><br />However, if you are primarily interested in this movie for your kids, I think it deserves at least 4 stars. There's plenty visual excitement and cuteness for younger viewers to enjoy, and there's no inappropriate humor or innuendo. There were a crew of 3 little kids in front of us at the theatre, I'd guess between ages 3-6, and they were mostly spell-bound for the entire motion picture. That says something good for a kids' movie.<br /><br />Thanks for reading.<br />-CL
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a very fun app if you like horses. You can get new horses while keeping your old one gist friends and much more. This is a good app and if you like horses you should get it.
B00A7CI82I|5.0|This was a great addition to this series. After seeing this I can't wait to see where they will go next. Growing up and still to this day the Bond movies are my favorite. The Bourne movies are a close second. But this is like comparing red apples to green apples.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Easy reading.....the story flows nicely.....I haven't read a book in a year or more and this one had me hooked right away. It was hard to put down.<br /><br />Maybe a sequel???
B00A23MYCC|5.0|This movie goes into my classic list for the bromance alone. The Thunder Buddy song is genius. A great movie to add to the collection.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I can't stop reading this book, I'm just over half way through and I had to write this review. This is a very detailed in-depth book written on a subject that most of us are familiar with abuse. A lot of research or first hand knowledge went into it you can tell. Well worth my money and time. This is the second review I've ever written the first wasn't so nice but...it was true. To the author I say Thank You, I know this book has probably cost you a few sleepless nights and me to.
B009YU6FJM|5.0|This is the album of the year in my opinion. Yet another great album. The flow and feel of this one really shows their maturity as musicians.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Always clowned this dude.  After hearing good things I bought it and it's really good.  Sounds rnbish, not this euro techno crap all these other rnb dudes have been putting out.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Watched this movie with my girlfriend thinking it was going to be a singing chick flick. WOW I was very wrong! I laughed almost throught the entire movie. The large cast still has quite a few stand out characters. A must see for anyone looking for a good laugh.
B00AFEXRME|4.0|Really enjoyed the movie.Great lesson. Alcohol and drugs are a problen  and this movie shows what a harsh lesson for offenders.  Denzel Washington was great..
B00AXVIBKW|5.0|Bought this as the deal of the week for $5. Not saying it's not worth full price,because it is. Will recommend this to a lot of people.
0762445262|5.0|The Batman signal light is smaller than I thought it would be but its very cute and perfect for kids to use when they are playing with their little action figurines.....I love it!!!!
B00BI73CVI|5.0|I am a Les Miserables fanatic. I've seen the play twelve times since 1985. My collection of Les Miserables souvenirs include several coffee mugs, two keychains, one the brass keychain of the theater ticket, two match boxes, t-shirt, sweatshirt, nightshirt, beach towel, pen, movie and play posters, the complete Broadway production on both cassette and CD, piano and clarinet sheet music, the video of BOTH the NY and Los Angeles PBS production of the 10th Anniversary Pledge Drive Specials and the 25th on video, and saved on my DV and of course, the recently published book Les Miserables -  From Stage to Screen and of course Victor Hugo's novel.<br /><br />When it was announced that, at long last, the production was going to be made into a movie, I had my doubts. When I heard who they had cast for the major characters, I was skeptical to say the least. To say I was pleasantly surprised would be a gross understatement.<br /><br />When the movie premiered on Christmas day, I woke up at 6am to drive to Century City in Los Angeles to see the movie in IMAX. The theater was sold out. The audience applauded the performances as enthusiastically as if they were in a live theater.  I've seen the movie four additional times. Once with my husband, who actually sobbed at the finale, once with my daughters and twice by myself. And each time, went through an entire box of tissues.<br /><br />Because of this film, I could feed my \\"addiction\\" 5 times for less than the price of one theater ticket. Because of this film, I only needed to drive 10 minutes to the closest movie theater instead of having to drive more than an hour to a theater. Because of this film, thousands of fans, new ones and ones yet to be born will have the opportunity to experience this incredible story written more than 150 years ago.<br /><br />Because of modern technology, I downloaded this video at 8 in the morning the first day of its release and I've been playing it on my laptop while working on my PC non-stop for the past 2 days! Yes, I can say my addiction is being very well fed and is, I'm sure, millions of others around the world.<br /><br />Long after this year's Oscar winner Argo fades from memory, Les Miserables will continue to inspire, enthrall and gain new fans for generations to come thanks to this wonderful labor of love by so many.<br /><br />My friends and family who ask me what is so special about Les Miserables, I tell them, \\"If you don't \\"get it\\" I can't explain it...if you do, I don't have to.r the past 2 days! Yes, I can say my addiction is being very well fed and is, I'm sure, millions of others around the world.<br /><br />Long after this year's Oscar winner Argo fades from memory, Les Miserables will continue to inspire, enthrall and gain new fans for generations to come thanks to this wonderful labor of love by so many.<br /><br />My friends and family who ask me what is so special about Les Miserables, I tell them, \\"If you don't \\"get it\\" I can't explain it...if you do, I don't have to.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I did not buy my pair from Amazon, but thought I should chime in due to my extensive experience (20 yrs) with these headphones.<br />I love headphone listening due to having a family, with all sorts of noise pollution.<br /><br />  I like to have several pairs for convenience. One for my favorite chair, one in the bedroom for nighttime video or music, one pair at the office, etc.  I have gone through several pair of other maker's headphones which have failed but, my approximately 20 year old faithful MDR-7506 cans have kept on trucking.<br /><br />  They are rugged, convenient, comfortable, block enough noise without totally blocking all noise; which would not be good in a family setting (phone ringing, child needing me, etc.)and they sound great. Good flat response with no nasties which cause listening fatigue. Can you do better? Well, certainly not for the money. IMHO, you would have to spend several hundred dollars more to get better sound, and even then the build quality would not be better. These are, without a doubt, the best closed can headphones I have ever owned, and by a high degree to boot.<br /><br />I looked them up because another brands headphones that I own just died, and I decided to start saving up for another pair of these. No sense in buying another brand when I already know that these cannot be beat for the money.<br /><br />Highest recommendation.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|i love this game!! easy to play, but also a challenge.has a good story line. around the world in eighty days is always a classic winner in any genre
B007JOM0GC|5.0|These songs have such a ring of truth in them for any woman of any age who has been in and out of relationships. Sure the songs are fun to listen to but there is a surprising honesty and vulnerability behind a lot of them. One of my favorite music purchases.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Well my sister was bored at the science fair and got out her kindle fire. She was playing this game. She said it was titled &quot;Hungry Shark Evolution...
B007L3BMGA|5.0|LOVED IT.  Loved the relationship and rapport between Christian and Ana.  Loved Christian by the end as well.  I started this book rather skeptically, but did so for a friend to keep them happy.  I must say it was a little hard to get through the first several chapters, however once I was there I was hooked.  I was so hooked that I read the three part series in as many days.  As soon as I finished the first book I HAD to buy the second and third and was impatiently staring at my Kindle and tapping my fingers while the next book downloaded.  I must say I really was very surprised, this is not my 'genre' (if I can call it that), nothing about the premise of the book bode well for my enjoyment and yet, I LOVED IT.  Not sure what else to say.  I recommend to give it a go, at least finish the first book.  If you're not hooked (and in love with Christian despite his fifty shades of grey ;)), then it probably isn't your thing and I wouldn't recommend spending money on the following two books.  If however you fall in love as I have, go for it!! :D
B0037471TE|4.0|Ludlum's first in this series. It was difficult to put the book down. The thriller was gripping enough for me to look forward to finishing the dinner to return to this world Ludlum created.<br /><br />A must read, but I should warn you; it might end in addiction to the Bourne series.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|Been watching this movie at Christmas every year. Still gets a tear out of me, Love this classic! Glad I could find it on DVD since my VHS is getting very old.
B008QE9XD2|3.0|It's no secret that many fans of the Dark Shadows TV series did not enjoy this movie.  As one of those fans, I certainly have my misgivings.  A lot of good opportunities were missed, a lot of potential squandered, and that's sad.<br /><br />Having said that, though, if you don't know anything about the original and you come to this movie with no expectations, you might enjoy it.  At the very least, it's classic Tim Burton, if you like that kind of thing.<br /><br />The really sad part for me is that people who don't know about the original show might see this movie and say \\"Oh, so THAT'S Dark Shadows.\\"  If you're one of those people, let me assure you:  this movie is NOT Dark Shadows!!!  (To find out more about the original Dark Shadows, may I suggest you visit our podcast or the FORUM connected to that podcast, which you can get to by googling \\"Dark Shadows podcast\\").<br /><br />The real Dark Shadows deserves a chance to stand on its own.  You can see episodes online for free in various places, or check out the episodes and sets on Amazon.  Give the REAL Dark Shadows a chance.  After a few episodes, you'll be hooked.
B0043VDIAG|3.0|This book was very readable and others may like it more than me. If you are looking for a romantic read then this is for you. It had the makings of a good thriller and the thriller side of it was interesting.  I would have liked that part of the story to be developed more.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Great game to spend a few minutes playing. Can also play longer if time permits. It is a great time waster.
B0036UW09U|5.0|This is one of my favorite films.  I chose &#34;Evergreen&#34; as my wedding song in 1979 after seeing this movie.  I still enjoy &#34;A Star is Born&#34; 34 years later.  The &#34;stars&#34; (Barbra & Kris) are amazing. A great remake of an &#34;older&#34; movie.

B00BM1AJIO|5.0|I would give this game a five star if not for the glitch I experienced twice so far while playing half way through at level 6 having to re-download twice.  The first re-download wasn't successful even after talking to Amazon tech support for more than 30 minutes.  I kept getting the error message that verification failed and needed to re-download.  The screen would freeze at the message and would not re-download.  A week later I tried again.  This time I was able to re-download and played level one.  I wasn't able to finish the level before going to bed.  When I resumed the game the next day, the same error message appeared again.  I couldn't understand why I got the message when I already started playing.  I quit and waited one day.  When I resumed the game again, it had to verify the file so I could play again.  Several minutes into the game, a window popped up asking me to leave a review.  That's what I'm doing right now.  I have no idea if I'm able to continue the game after the review.  I wonder if the files are downloaded incrementally through the progress of the game and not all at one time.  Now I'm going back to the game.  Hopefully it works.<br /><br />Update on 3/25/2013:<br />I originally gave this game a four star rating because of the glitches I experienced.  Now I finished the game.  I changed the rating to five star.  I figured out why I was experiencing glitches.  I didn't tap on Menu to exit the game.  I tapped on back button or home page button on my Kindle to exit the game.  I had no problem when I exited the game the right way.  There are 6 levels.  I thought the game would be longer since there are still several unexplorered paintings.  I wish it was longer.  I had fun though.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|great show. Was skeptical at first but  got hooked after a few shows.  LOVE it for sure. Cant wait for season 4

B000NY12CI|5.0|Ayaan and I are  close in age, but her life's journeys have taken her places I could only imagine. The book reflected similar thoughts I've had as a child although I'm African-American born and reared in the US. Her book has  made me reexamine my  complacency in life out of fear and low self esteem.  AYAAN,Again has challenged me and other women everywhere to stop accepting the status quo.
B00316DDUE|5.0|Let me preface this by saying that I am not a big Yanni fan. That being said, a friend lent me his copy of this and told me to just give it a chance. He was right, this is one of the best sounding Blu-Rays I have heard. Beautiful arrangements and world class musicians playing a wide assortment of instruments. Sooooo, I bought it. You just have to ignore all of the fake smiles, etc., and enjoy it for the great sound.
B0002E5O9G|5.0|The music speaks for itself.  This unique presentation combines outstanding aspects of many performances.  Large chorus enhances many songs. My favorite is &#34;Do You Hear . . &#34; sung by stars from shows around the world in their native languages.  Proves music truly is universal.  If you enjoyed the play you will find this a gem.
B00417HV14|5.0|This guy may be the best guitar player out there, next to Clapton. And I know it's sacrilegious to say this, but he may have Clapton beat as well. You can judge for yourself as Clapton comes out to join Joe on a splendid rendition of &#34;Further On Up the Road.&#34; Plus, it's at the Royal Albert Hall. I doesn't get much better than that.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|it does not work on a kindle fire. I would rate it a 0 if I could. if you want to make a game or something usefull make it good quality and for all devices!!!!!!!! Not good
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|I've owned this concert on DVD for a long time, and was always hoping it would come out on Blu-ray. I am not disappointed. I'm guessing that this has probably become a demo Blu-ray in a number of home theater stores. A great concert just got better with the release on Blu-ray. If you're an Eagles fan, you're going to want this.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|Was absolutely enthralled with this documentary. The music was relevant even for today. I was even more excited when it won the Academy Award for Best Documentary.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|I saw this movie three times when it was at local movie theaters in Los Angeles.  I had to buy it.<br /><br />This is a story of a man who is a quadriplegic and needs a person to help him with his day-to-day life.  It is based on a true story.  The man who is hired by him is not a person who feels sorry for him.  The man wanted someone who would not feel sorry for him.  Believe it or not, it is a comedy filled with tons of caring and sweetness.  It will go down as one of the top movies I have ever seen in my life.  (At the end of the movie, they show the real people who have remained friends.)<br /><br />I know if you live outside of a big city, this movie may not have been available.  It is in French, but has English subtitles.  In spite of the fact that many people do not like subtitles, I really, really recommend anyone buying this!  You will love it!!!
B001TCHDPS|4.0|I became interested in this artist after watch the documentary &#34;Searching for Sugarman.&#34; It was very interesting and I enjoyed the music being played throughout the movie. Too bad this artist has not had the opportunity to do more.

0345803485|5.0|This is a wonderful trilogy. Don't do what I did and buy them one at a time. You will get tired if waiting for the next book. Go ahead and buy the trilogy. It is worth it and you will want all three.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|This is a fabulous CD especially for a first timer. I saw Phillip Phillips during the AI tour and was amazed at the way he could take command of the stage. He is a true performer and has an amazing talent for songwriting and singing.
B00080ZG10|3.0|There's a lot of rich and tasty stuff in this movie, but like a donut, it has a considerable hole in the middle -- Leonardo DiCaprio.  I suspect that when it came to casting the picture, Mr. DiCaprio's reported interest in Howard Hughes took a back seat to his desire to star in it.  Otherwise, he'd have sought a character actor with the acting chops and presence to carry the lead.  Also one who wouldn't lose his way in the face of the confusion imposed on the shooting by the lavish sets, crowds of costume extras, and green-screen technicalities.  Although I don't recall Mr. DiCaprio's other pictures, I can see how his lighter roles have gone over as well as they have.
B007DIQC90|3.0|they are a talented band,upon repeated play their songs sound the same not to much stands out,the female singer has a nice voice maybe their next cd will be better
B009KEN87O|5.0|Better then the old one...wish I could play as well as I used to..love the new sound effects, recommend it to all early game players.
0385342063|5.0|I read this book in Spanish and all I can say is that this book is the perfect chicklit and really it must become a movie.

B003UBTX6S|4.0|It was a good read but not nearly as good as beautiful creatures. It didn't keep me interested as much and took me much longer to finish.
B0049VZ222|5.0|... had to catch up on the last three seasons. 10 bucks for hours of entertainment, with the option of watching again at my leisure. I'd say that's a pretty good deal. plays on my smart tv or any computer via the cloud. SWEEEET!.<br />No more boring waits in the doctors office. Double Sweeeet.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|Best and most irritating of seasons &#60;33<br />One of the few DVD buys that I think I will watch over and over. So cheap, too! ;D
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun game. Realistic. Not too addicting that you don't have time for anything else. I recommend that you buy it!
B008220BLG|5.0|I hadn't even seen the trailer before stepping into the theater.  My 13-year old daughter wanted to see this film, so we went together.  All I can say is I was hooked from the beginning to the end.  It was a remarkably personal story, and I never felt the zombie aspect overwhelmed the sentiment.  Likewise, I thought the filmmaker was remarkably restrained toward the end, when he could easily have gone overboard in the battle between the zombies and the military.  I highly recommend this film to everyone!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app. It does what its supposed to do. I downloaded it to both my kindle fire hd and my boys kindle fire. It works great on both platforms. I like that you can taylor the color to your preferences. It's a lot better knowing exactly how much battery life is left than having to guess.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|This is a great DVD for any Les Mis fan. I bought it after seeing the movie in theaters and absolutely loved it.
0375812024|5.0|If your planning an airline trip with your young children I would recommend this book.  It will familiar your child with what an airport looks like; what is the airport; pilot and staff.<br /><br />It will be a great way to keep a child occupied while waiting for a flight or playing I spy .....happy reading
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is like having your real horse but I hate how you have to have enough like stuff to compete!
B008220D7S|5.0|Why so many bad reviews?  This is a great movie.  Not only does it push the boundaries of comedy far beyond what's considered comfortable, the characters are genuine and the story keeps the situations fresh.<br /><br />This is way better than Knocked Up, that movie was just awful.  It wasn't funny or interesting at all.  Seth Rogan pretty much sucks at everything he's involved with, and lacks the talent to discontinue playing the same character in every movie he's in.  Thankfully, he and Catherine Heigl's characters don't show up in this.<br /><br />I think the problem that people are having with this movie is that, they are too stupid to realize which type of comedy this movie is.  They just don't understand it.  It's not dumbed-down garbage like Superbad, Knocked Up, or 40 Year Old Virgin.  Yes, it's got plenty of toilet-humor and nonsense, but that's what give the characters depth and authenticity.  The characters act out the way we want to, but don't.  They portray what we think in our minds, react to their situations the way we wish we could (Leslie Mann cussing out the bully is a perfect example of this).<br /><br />This is one of the funniest movies produced in a very long time, a cut above the all the other crap comedies being made lately.  You 1-star reviewers don't know what you're talking about.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Wonderful movie with a powerful message - I loved the book - I loved this movie -I thought it was better than the broadway show, but I couldn't afford better tickets to sit closer.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Usually listen to audio versions of Child's books but read this. Was. worth it. My only question is when in the world does Reacher ever sleep?
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I bought this for myself & my friends - it was powerful & wonderful & uplifting!  I highly recommend Victor Hugo's book for a compelling foundation for the movie.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|I hope that you cannot eat sea turtles because I like animals and I pity sea turtles but overall its a good game!
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|I got the book on Monday and had my first fast day on Wednesday, before I even finished the book. I did have a small snack (carrots and hummus) between breakfast and dinner. Next time, I think I will have my first meal at lunchtime as that was a long time between meals. Anyway, I have been eating less on my non-fast days and as of today (Saturday) am down 4 pounds! I should say that I'm an older woman and have been unable to lose weight on any other \\"mainline\\" (including Paleo) diets. I'm also very sensitive to carbs and could not eat any grains without putting on weight. I have to wait until Monday for my next fast day and then will go to Monday/Thursdays as many people suggest. I will update this in a couple of weeks to see if the weight loss continues.

1400034779|5.0|I am enjoying the beginning of this series.  He gave a lot of family background and incorporates social problems of the times in Africa.  He educates and makes the reader politically aware of the circumstances in Africa in the weaving of his stories.  I am looking forward to reading the rest of the series written in the excellent style of Alexander McCall Smith.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|great game! just the right amount of HO and mini games. the hint button guarantees you won't get lost. nothing was too difficult or too easy. loved it!
0812993357|4.0|A light and lighthearted memoir chronicling the highlights Grace Coddington's fabulous and enviable career, \\"Grace\\" is a fun, amusing and quick read for those interested in fashion.  The unassuming  Welsh-born Creative Director of American Vogue has had quite a life so far, and for someone who claims she's never read a book she does a wonderful job writing her memoir (although my advance reader's edition does not credit any other writer besides Ms. Coddington, I've heard rumblings that she was indeed assisted by a ghost writer).  Nevertheless, Coddington's easygoing, often gently self-effacing style is a pleasure to read, and it is interesting to see which parts of her illustrious 50-year career she has chosen to highlight (she's had so many accomplishments in the world of fashion, traveled to so many fantastic locales and met so many famous people that I don't know how she managed to pare it all down for the book).  Given the snarky nature of the fashion industry, Coddington is refreshingly positive about her experiences and colleagues (with the exception of fellow Vogue editor Carlyne Cerf de Dudzeele, whom I don't see how anyone could get along with).  While I adore Vogue magazine and high fashion, some of the book's most interesting chapters focus on Grace's early days growing up in sleepy Anglesey, and the early days of her career.  She is a truly fascinating woman - something that doesn't necessarily come across in the documentary \\"The September Issue,\\" where she appears to be merely Anna Wintour's long-suffering whipping girl.  The memoir reveals Grace's healthy no-nonsense approach to fashion - she understands that she's not curing cancer, and she is thankful for the creativity and levity her chosen career affords her (and she's also careful to state that she doesn't see what she does as \\"art.\\").  The books is dotted with Grace's whimsical drawings and includes many photographs of her famous friends, coworkers and subjects, as well as her iconic fashion spreads and covers.  Determined to expose her true self, a charming chapter in the book is devoted to Ms. Coddington's pet cats, whom she adores. Self actualized and completely sane, Grace paints a very admirable picture of a life spent following one's dream.
B002ZG974M|4.0|at first when i seen the cover i taught it was going to be like baby genuis but it show me how it like rasing a baby from different race and all i kept saying was aww they so cute

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|It had adventure romance and cliff hangers at he end. I really love Rick Riordan because he writes such good books like Percy Jackson, Kane chronicles and I hope the series never ends.
B0006A9FKA|2.0|A thousand times better, this movie was two steps up from dead boring and it felt like work to watch it all the way through..
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|For the most part, a great cast. But this is obviously written by young men who think that, at 40, our greatest achievement is being able to say f* constantly. Really? This isn't very funny. The cast is wasted on this film.
B002WY65VU|5.0|Good movie, if you don't mind a little gratuitis blood that is. Woody is funny and the story holds your attention. Great for watching with a twinkie!
B00BHMETKC|3.0|A mostly-good story line, some suspenseful scenes and reasonable acting. We were entertained for two hours but are not interested in seeing it again.<br /><br />It amazes us that this won best picture. That says volumes about the quality of the other contenders; they must have been truly awful for this film to come out on top.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I love books that I can disappear into, and this was one of them. I honestly had low expectations because I got it for super cheap and I've had bad luck with those lately. It starts off rather slowly but hooks you in after a bit. I liked the suspense of not knowing what was happening until you got further in. The characters were lovable and deep, the storyline was excellent, I really enjoyed it.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|For Kendal fire it is awesome and I don't want to 20words so I am just gonna put the rest a a a a a a
B009PHQ9OA|5.0|First of all, this is absolutely stunning: Dan's voice is chillingly perfect, the melodies are fantastically haunting, and the lyrics are beautifully poetic and enchanting.<br /><br />Bastille's songs are laced with simple rhythms but filled with haunting melodies that leave the listener still enveloped and entranced even after the song has ended.<br />Most bands are directly relatable to ones from the past, Bastille is not at all like this. It's fresh, new, and amazing as its subtle influences are many great ones. I'd also like to point out that so many of the songs are emotively based off of past events and fiction such as Icarus, Weight of Living Pt 1 (hidden track), Laura Palmer, Daniel in the Den, and Pompeii. What other artist has been able to put past stories and events to music and still reach the top of the charts?<br /><br />So, all in all, best album of the year, no doubt. Five stars from me. If you're on the fence, don't be. I cannot wait for these guys to come see us in America!<br /><br />Also, check out their \\"Other People's Heartbreak\\" cover albums if you're dying for more B∆STILLE.
B009DT98RK|5.0|I enjoyed this DVD, I would recommend watching the bonus feature first.  It is well worth the price for how many hours this DVD plays.  Peter Frampton is even better now than when he was younger, a master guitar player.
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|Good movie for singles that neglects their kids. As you find out later in life, what you have missed in the years as they grew up and become.
B004EPZ084|3.0|This movie was OK but I would rather have rented it at Red Box and saved money...good for a one time view
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Excellent movie. This type of lfe still goes on this country, mainly in the south. Just don't se it or hear about it. Shame.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Daniel Craig is not Sean Connery but he has formed his own persona and does an admirable job in the more &#34;modern Bond&#34;<br />I also loved the title song by Adele..she is now one of my favorite singers and have several of her hits as well.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|G5 did it again I love the games that they have can not wait for the next hidden object game to come out!
B008220C38|1.0|This movie was so bad they should pay you to watch it ...thought it would be a nice &#34;period piece&#34; movie but instead it was a movie that should never have been made. I don't know what the lead actors/actresses were thinking when they agreed to do this movie.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|This cable was for my Daughter who had lost her original charger for her Kindle and like it because it allowed her to charge her Kindle again
B0035G5IOE|5.0|This movie is amazing. For adults and kids alike, you cannot go wrong with this classic.  The stop motion animation with the animals is done superbly and the characters really come to life.<br />This particular version comes with 3 discs- the bluray, DVD, and digital copy. for the price, this is a really great deal. and not to mention, it came in ONE DAY. shipping was unbelievably fast and i was able to satisfy my fox watching craving.<br />You will not be disappointed in this story.
0606259090|3.0|It was alright if all you want is sex. For me I like for a book that makes me think about what will be happening next.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I really enjoy this game so far. Some of the levels are kind of hard to figure out but I like it. It has held my interest and I like it as much as Bejeweled.
B004ODLUF8|5.0|The movie is attracts general audiences.  It gives us beautiful pictures of space (planets, galaxies, stars, etc).  It is informative and makes the Universe more exciting. Gives impressive images and information of the space.  I would recommend it to anybody.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Excellent graphics! Crisp and clear!  Clever mini-games that are not too hard or too easy.  Nice option to play a matching game instead of the hidden object game.  You get to choose each time which adds more variety.  Uses logic to advance the game with hints available.  My favorite part is the cute monkey that helps you get objects.  Good storyline too.  This game has it all!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|5 Stars!! I have read other great books such as \\"The Red Circle\\" and \\"No Easy Day\\", but so far I enjoyed this one the most.  The book was action packed, and Chris did a great job of explaining each situation.

B009A3NGF4|5.0|The Grammy academy definitely got this one right (as they did a few years ago with giving the same award to Arcade Fire).  The elements and approach M & S use isn't hugely innovative or complex.  But the way they mash brilliant writing, wonderful subject matter, anthemic choruses, roots-inspired instrumentation, and unbelievable emotion---there just isn't anything out there quite like 'em.<br /><br />But it's not for a lack of trying.  There have been numerous acts (an American idol and a band referencing monsters, to name two) that sound pretty good, but this is the real thing.  The ambition and emotion separate them from similar acts.  I didn't think it was possible that they could top Sigh No More, but I believe they proved me wrong.  And in the process, further proved that the term &#34;sophomore slump&#34; doesn't apply to this band.
0064410935|5.0|I bought this classic to read to my 6 and 10yo kids at night before bedtime.  The 6yo girl loved it!!  We live in a small town, Grandpa has a farm and they've been to the county fair so they totally understood ii.
0316134082|5.0|Ebooks are great, but I still like to collect my favorite books. Though its received way too much print on both sides of the fence, this is still a favorite series. The special edition hardbacks are a nice collector's item.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Game of thrones is a series set in medieval time. If you like Spartacus where there is a good story line and blood in guts then this series is for you. My wife and I watched all the series in 2  days and that was while she was working. Its hard to put down once you start watching it.
B006YTTVHO|5.0|Mr Murphy offers many pointers to get you started and send you on your way to not being a hermit or wallflower.  Personally, I will re-read the book many times until I'm a wiz at talking to people ;-)

B0052UZIFA|5.0|More fun than any other Android game I have tried.  Great time waster!  Long enough that you won't run out of enjoyment either.
B005S9EKCW|1.0|Maybe this is the way it's supposed to be, but I enjoyed the German version much more on DVD.  I am 25 minutes into the movie and have yet to hear one spoken word.  Every single word has been sung.  I am a fan of musicals, but this one really takes the cake.  For that reason alone, I am being driven nuts!
1592402690|5.0|If you want a book that tells the recording side of the Beatles, this is it. From technical to personal, Geoff Emerick covers it all. Geoff was there, behind the glass with George Martin. No need to say anything more. Buy it!!!!!!. Note: The only thing I didn't like about the book was the cover. Out of thousands of Beatle pictures, they chose one without Ringo. Fab four, not the Fab three.
B009AMANBA|5.0|This isn't the Lincoln in marble sitting on a throne.  This isn't a crazy woman for a wife.  This is real history as I would believe it was.  Lincoln was honest but he had to struggle with that honesty too.  Mary Lincoln was dramatic and a southern belle who had been pampered and raised to be spoiled but she loved her husband and children like any mother and wife.  I feel she's been given a bad rap by politics and judgments that are far worse than she was. Just a few years later, a president's widow was given a much larger pension without even having to fight for it.<br /><br />I understand Lincoln better now. He too was haunted by ghosts and fought with depression.  He loved his wife although she was trying. He loved his children and mourned for them in private. He was wise beyond his years and a true humanitarian.<br /><br />What a wonderful movie to show our children and grandchildren, one that is worthy of seeing over and over again.  It moved me to tears and I'm so glad it did not focus on the assassination itself.  I have seen the Kennedy assassination too many times. No assassination should be sensationalized and I'm so happy the focus was on more important things. Well done!
B00845PRDS|5.0|Excellent, excellent.  I've seen reviews that say you could tell these are not Hollywood actors, SO WHAT.  They are real SEALS.  This is great, if you want suspense, thrills, electrifying action, the real stuff, get Act of Valor.
B0084YAU86|5.0|In particular, the Reichenbach Fall offers an explanation for \\"Chinese hacking\\" exploits in late 2012 and 2013 and for the reasons behind this \\"hacking\\". I think that this episode in particular was so close to reality that the BBC decided to end the series or make certain any followup series would steer clear of \\"sensitive political topics\\".

B005S9EKCW|4.0|This was not the best movie that could have been made from the musical, but it was pretty good. And the camera work was weird--too many close-ups. They could have pointed the camera somewhere else, like at the surroundings and what is going on at the time. It doesn't always have to be trained on the person singing.<br /><br />I felt that the songs that were done the best were the ones I didn't care about too much, like \\"At the End of the Day,\\" \\"Lovely Ladies,\\" and \\"I Dreamed a Dream.\\" All the stuff between Valjean and Javert wasn't that good. The beginning part, which I LOVE in the musical, was particularly bad. It just sounded very thin, and that beginning part, the overture, should sound very full. In fact, a lot of the singing sounded a bit thin, and this was particularly noticeable in Jackman's and Crowe's singing. But oh well, what can you do, it was sung live and these are not professional singers. \\"Empty Chairs at Empty Tables,\\" which I loved when Michael Ball sang it in the 10th Anniversary Concert, sounded particularly thin. Maybe they should have had the ghosts of his comrades there too, like they did in the concert.
0525478817|5.0|A breathless emotional roller coaster that hooked me in the moment I read the first page. This is hard to review. Not because it is not worthy of a review...look at my rating and that tells you it is. It is just hard because for starters I am not a \\"reviewer\\", nor a writer, but I can just plain and simply let folks know if I like something or not. Okay, so when I was on page 136 I posted on twitter to @realjohngreen that the book was awesome and again I posted when I was on page 177 that I wish my lunch hour had not ended because I just had to know. Then on to Chapter 20, I was in a car dealership waiting room surrounded by men. Not the best place to be when reading a book such as this. Fighting the tears in my eyes I had to close the book, text my daughter of my current emotional state and wait patiently until I arrived home where I quickly snuggled up with Kleenex in hand and finished the story. At each of those moments I was excited, anxious and worried. When I say it was an emotional roller coaster, I mean it. I was happy, sad, and angry, worried, and perplexed...everything. There were moments when I connected with Hazel as I do with my own daughter and that warmed me. There were times I imagined that I was Hazel (don't tell my husband) only to be in the presence of hot hunky Augustus (Gus); even with his notorious dangling cigarettes. And there were times that I can only pray not to be in the shoes of any of them, for then I would not know the pain and loss, yet I know as well as everyone else that eventually we all end up...<br />This is a gripping, tearful, beautiful with some genuine humor, love story about living! A must read.
B00A85EMVK|5.0|This movie has everything...action, love, jets, pilots, women.<br /><br />This version is like a dream come true! No..litterally...I had a dream just like it! 3D and all!!!<br /><br />BUY IT!
0547328567|5.0|This book has it all!  Intriguing and comical pictures that my 3 - 6 year olds loved.  They laughed out loud at several (the slide sheep gets the biggest laugh).  Adults chuckled over the &#34;Rain Sheep&#34; because of the &#34;Singing in the Rain&#34; likeness. Clean, clear illustrations, and text that sings.  Yes, SINGS!  I do this book as a call response with a little tune by Barb Tilsen.  Don't miss the question on the back cover for a discussion starter - Where would YOU hide if you were a green sheep?  Kids are begging for this book!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I have greatly enjoyed this game.  It features stimulating graphics, storyline,  puzzles,  and great hidden object quests.  You get a lot of game playing for the price.  Can't wait for the sequel.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|The game is fantastic and it definitely competes with Dungeon Hunter and other Glu Games. Keep up the good work Glu Mobile!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This is the number one 3D movie of all time (money maker).  It has great visuals and a pretty decent story.  I enjoyed seeing it in the theater and at home on my LED Samsung.  I recommend it for anyone who likes action movies.  Good Flick.
B00B7ERH04|1.0|It worked play until it said I needed 10 camcoins I tried to get more but it still won't let
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this app lets you complete daily challenges and pick up coins to purchase new in-game items! its not one of those games where you have to use real money to get anywhere!! I love it and my daughter does too!!
B006C1DH92|5.0|I wanted this but it was 99&cent; but yesterday it was free and I got it I also have the original fruit ninja. :)
B00BWJARHO|5.0|The hobbit was a wonderful movie, it leaves you hanging a bit at the end but overall a great representation of the book!
B0056BMK6K|5.0|I enjoyed the way John presents this new and very fresh thought process for new as well as experienced writers.  It was a quick read and easy to understand with a sense of humor that made it very enjoyable.  I have read other books with the same theme but they were dry and long and I felt a true waste of time.  This book was informative, fresh and I will use it as a reference.  Thanks to John for writing this book from a truly different thought process.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a fun little game...it's kept me entertained for a good while! Good job everyone!<br />Highly recommended for all ages.
B003LXXEFG|5.0|This has to be The Cure best Album ever! I really did enjoyed it when it first came out in 1989, that was a year after I'd graduated from High School. The music these days are the same like they were back then in the late 70's, 80's and 90's.
0783116934|4.0|based on true story,well-acted ensemble tells horrific story based in former soviet russia where frustrations in catching worlds worst serial killer is hampered by soviet bureacracy..

B008K6HN8I|5.0|That's it. They're going to make me type a whole bunch of words when the title says it all. It is almost perfect.
1781163243|5.0|This is exactly what I'm looking for ! I love this game and I not disappointed absolutely, this art book ! There is a lot of arts from the game. I recommend it for all who love sci-fi art in best edition.
B006R8GK2Q|1.0|I was hoping for an enjoyable hidden object game.<br />Paranormal Agency does not even come close. The game constantly freezes up, and the pop ups asking me to sign in to face book are truly annoying.  I honestly cannot think of one facebook friend that would even care what my score is!!  Hopefully they all have lives that don't include the need to know this type of nonsense.  Sorry I spent the money for this game.
B008X6N1OA|4.0|My KidsIt'sove To Watch This Movie. I Don't Think It Is As Good As The Third One But It's Good.
B009KEN87O|5.0|This is a great and fun game! If you love retro gaming, this is your app! I simply cannot put it down! This is well worth the price!!!!
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I got this not expecting much, but it does everything I need and more.  I highly recommend this product for any gamer.
B0047T86G0|1.0|It comes installed on your device. Tried to get help, but told it \\"comes\\" with the device and can't be removed. Its worthless to me, and I find it hard to use. It doesn't take up much space, but it still takes up my limited space.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book really opens up your view about the War in Iraq. You see the sacrifices young Marines, soldiers, and SEALS made to keep the country safe. One of the best books I have ever read.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Pieces far too small when you do one of the harder levels. Should offer a re-size option on pieces not in use.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's a little glichy, But I still enjoy the game. I really like the places they choose. Right now it's Rome.
B0042J6VUS|2.0|товар получил с согнутой ножкой, упаковка не надежная, очень не приятное впечатление от продавца, не серьезное отношение к товару и к покупателям.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book is about the why. Of  Gray,s beginnings ,and caused his not lack of affection to others and not wanting to be touched .Why there is a hate towards Ana ,Christren ,  Carrick and other members Gray family .Why..
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great game when it works ;  it freezes up and you have uninstall and then reinstall.my daughter likes to play it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I must say, Suzan Collins did a brilliant job with this series. I actually have no Idea what to do with my life now. Because every day I would be excited to read this.. now I have nothing.. :/
B0080R5SV6|5.0|Great book! Richard Dawkins is probably the greatest biologist of our time. This book is very thought provoking with British wit.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|LOVED IT! Wish I had the money to buy the full version, it would definitely be worth it. It's so addicting! I love GS games
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I have now read all of the hunger games books and I will have to say this is the best.  It is so good if you read this book you must read the epilogue at the end.  It is a wonderful book about how peace can come come from anything.  I recommend you to read all 3 books.  Best books ever!!:)
B006LSZECO|5.0|It's been a very long time since a book has held me in such a trance. Talk about ORIGINAL! Again: amazing!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is the best game ever horse loves should love it the pictures are very good too I love it you should get it
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This game is incredible. No doubt about it. Nicely planned, with classes that fit anyone's battle strategy. Lots of different ways to earn coins, unlike many other arena fighting games. I'm usually not a fan, but I definitely recommend this game. :)
B00AREIAI8|4.0|If you ever wanted a horse when you were little this game is THE best possible game to get because you get take care of it and compete with it. Such a fun game!!!!!!!!!
0765325950|5.0|I have been waiting a long time for the end of this series. I am not sure that Robert Jordan could have done much better.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The Book Thief was a pretty easy read, despite the subject matter. The story was interesting, character development was good, the writing style was great and draws you into the story, and while it's a tough ending, I thoroughly enjoyed this book.<br /><br />The writing stood out the most, not necessarily the style (written from the voice of Death) but the language. It is beautifully descriptive, and stood out to me throughout the book. Definitely worth the read for anyone in my opinion. Just expect sadness with a WWII setting, so if you're not surprised by that it makes it easier.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Being introduced to this book is, itself, an omen. Coelho's words are reinforcing encouragement to press onward in pursuit of your hearts desire... your personal legend. This will remain in my personal library for ages to come. Very enlightening and uplifting! Bravo!
B009KEN87O|5.0|This is the perfect app for any fan of Galaxian, Galaga, or any other game like that. I love it!!!!!!
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|Running time approx. 2hr 36min. This movie educates you on the CIA's hardcore intelligence driven difficult and ruthless task of locating and killing Ben Laden.You will see the blood, sweat and tears, lost in that process. It's NOT a documentary...it's a full blown movie that illustrates all of the above. Some of the actors are B-List actors that have been in many A-list movies: example: The Thing 2012, The Avengers, and Safe House just to name a few. Hi-def sound and Picture, high-end CGI were applicable. Great acting, cinematography, sets, and props. I highly recommend purchase on Blue-ray, for historical value, and for the love from our hearts given to ALL that died on 9/11, and to their families. Never forget! Thank you.
B00000DI06|4.0|A beautiful rendition of this magnificant piece.  Lyrical, full of haunting passages, enjoyed it over and over. Well worth a listen
B0089LOKHG|2.0|I fell in love with the first two books and the third was fairly good, but the way it ends made me want to scream at how much is left unknown. After it being a story of a fight for the freedom to love, the message is lost in the final book and just becomes another story for survival. The series itself is gripping and exciting, but the ending seems rushed and not thought out. It stops suddenly right in the middle of the action which ruined the series and really made me angry.
B00009RDG9|4.0|William Friedkin is a seasoned director with his share of hits and misses. Whatever his failings might be they aren't on the technical level. The man knows how to frame and set up a shot. It's just that at times the script isn't up to his technical abilities. That's the case here.<br /><br />Here's the scoop. Benicio Del Toro plays Aaron Hallam, a high level ops dude who's been on too many missions and seen too many innocent people get killed. Ethnic cleansing in Kosovo puts him over the edge. Now he's gone renegade in the Pacific Northwest preying on hunters who are way over equipped to kill defenseless animals. The FBI brings in Tommy Lee Jones, an ace tracker who originally trained Hallam, to bring him in. Of course things go horribly wrong.<br /><br />Like \\"True Blood\\", you have a top-level operative in the Northwest being tracked by feds who are nowhere near his ability to kill and survive. Like \\"The Fugitive\\" you have Tommy Lee, who knows his stuff, tracking a guy to bring him in. The meeting of the two films works fairly well. The dialogue is not really very good but is, thankfully, kept to a minimum. What is happening here is the movement through terrain. Friedkin lovingly uses the gorgeous territory to draw the viewer in. This is a breath stealing part of the country to begin with, and he shows the grandeur of the water, rocks, trees and everything else. You want to be there. And watching the high-level skill set of Jones and Del Toro is also very good. The techniques shown in tracking and hand to hand combat seem authentic. The two men's preparation for their final conflict is a bit over the top. Del Toro has nowhere near enough time to fashion the weapons and booby traps he uses. The final conflict though is choreographed and executed extremely well.<br /><br />This is better craft than it is art but it's still a heck of a watch, particularly for guys. If you want a dose of some testosterone laden action, this goes well with beer and pizza.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|This was a great surprise for my kids.They were so excited to get it in the mail. I think we watched it 3 times the day we got it. The music on this movie always makes me want to dance:)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is just like having your own horse ,so if you don't have room for a real horse it's just for you to me I love horses but don't have room for one so this game makes it a real thing.
B007712XAU|5.0|They arrived very quickly and I have watched them several times. There is so much going on at Downton that I discover something &#34;new&#34; each time.  I just love this series so much!  I'm thrilled to find them on Amazon because I couldn't find them in our local stores!
B00457WZEI|5.0|OMG! This story is very intense, sad, and uplifting. Some parts are sad, because of deaths and leading to bad times. The way the author describes the war and the horse's travel seem to me very intense. The end of the story is VERY uplifting and so happy it made me cry. :)
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I am not sure Christopher Nolan could top this one.<br /><br />What a great way to finish the trilogy.  See you in Italy.  Never know.
B00AH8FTT2|5.0|The third book of the series is every bit as good as the first two.  Can't wait for the fourth book.  Well rounded characters and story lines.  It keeps you turning the pages.  Vintage Jeffrey Archer.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Another great read!  Solid plot, interesting characters.  Two clues I gathered early in the book, plot still in tack just dangled like a carrot in the back corner of my mind.  Enjoy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fast challenging more stuff to buy and fully ecplainetory items. Harder then temple run. Blab blab blab boat blab balh
B0076DCT2G|5.0|DeMille does not disappoint in this latest thriller. The wise cracking John Corey is back and getting himself in trouble again. Setting is Yemen where the culturally insensitive Corey is chasing and being chased by a home grown terrorist. I could not put the book down and I can blame DeMille for some more nights of not enough sleep. Thanks.
B002N1AEMS|5.0|Great album -- buying it on vinyl allowed me to discover a bunch of other songs I like. Come with a little piece of paper with instructions for downloaded the mp3s -- Don't throw out!
B001PA0FF4|5.0|This movie shows just how good a movie can be without all the useless special effects that we are beginning to get bored with.<br /><br />Come on screen writers. Write more stories like this one!
B00594XOZU|4.0|its a great app for wifi when you hsve no min. i tell all friends bout the app as well
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Uninstall the old version and download the lasted version from the app store. Since its your app it is free to download again.
B002RSDW80|3.0|The scenes with Meryl Streep as Julia Child and Stanley Tucci as Paul Child are fantastic, if a bit honeyed and glowing, and well worth buying the DVD for if you're a Child fan.  The scenes with Amy Adams, Chris Messina, and their twenty/thirtysomething friends are stale, dull, and irritatingly interrupt the beautifully-acted story of Julia Child's life.  Child thought Julie's Powell's blog was an uninteresting stunt; you'll find Child's judgment duly vindicated in the \\"Julie\\" half of the film.  That's why it gets 3 stars from me, but it's still worth watching.
B00BN3EE1O|5.0|I saw it in the cinema and unfortunately I didn't finish the book before that, but it wasn't a problem. Movie has a little bit different view over the book, but not much. I liked the whole environment and characters. The music that is used in it is good and makes it wholesome. It was a love story, but yet so different. It seemed many times that the end has to be sad and the movie kept the suspense until the end. I don't want to spoil it, but I recommend it. It's a good movie and great book, as all Nicholas Sparks' books.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Lots of changes and new features make this game very interesting and fun, for more than one day. Highly recommended.
1606863622|5.0|\\"Dear John\\" is definitely the next great book after \\"The Notebook\\". It's an example of true love that stays, no matter what life brings. Both main characters are different, but they are right for each other. I liked that the book has romance, sacrifice and tears. It shows that love isn't so easy and people have to make it work, but it may get hard in distance.
B007TXN4TK|3.0|It is pretty good. HARD to press keys when screen is moving. AND IMPPOSIBLE to press three key at once on kindle fire (it doesn't support it). Key size is ok but can be changed if you need it to be.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|It is an amazing Disney's movie. It has everything like all Disney movies have: good vs bad, love, friendships and so on. \\"Tangled\\" has great music, singers are good and all kids love it. It is heartwarming and everyone will love it. DVD is worth its price and it should definitely belong to your DVD collection.
B000SEFNMS|4.0|I found it to really be a study on a type of human personality more than the telling of a story. Page turning, rich, rewarding read.<br /><br />For me personally, not as riveting as Into Thin Air, and the chapter in Into The Wild where Krakauer himself climbs in Alaska might have been my favorite part of this book. I'm not a mountain climber, it's just how he writes about it all. I believe he was built to write about mountains more than anything else.<br /><br />It's also a good mystery tale, with the whole story not coming to light until the very end. Many interesting people met along the way and very adventurous. Makes you want to get out from behind the book and taste life for yourself.<br /><br />So, highly enjoyed reading. Recommended. I find myself telling to the story to many people and they all find it interesting. Makes for great conversations.
B007N6NGYG|5.0|Train Crisis HD is a puzzle game in which you must safely conduct multiple trains to their colored station. The app has 4 game modes: Industrial era 1&2, and Farwest Era 1&2. These levels are done well, with bridges in the Industrial Era and canyons, deserts, and fallen rocks in the Farwest era. There are a variety of things you have to utilize in the game, including banks, stop lights (to pause one train for 5 seconds), going around boulders (in which you have dynamite to blow up), etc. In Farwest Era 2 for example, you have to go to banks and collect a certain amount of money, so this is good for Kindergarten/1st grade + students as well as adults. The game looks good, makes you think, is fast paced, and loads of fun. Regularly priced at 0.99, it's a good bargain.<br />(Kindle Fire HD)
0739384198|4.0|This is very dumb that it is required that I explain why I chose this rating. I like it, that's why!!
B008MEM24S|5.0|This game is great for my 3 year old, he will play it any chance he gets.  It is not easy and I find it challenging, but he enjoys it.
B000JML7EC|4.0|This is very dumb that it is required that I explain why I chose this rating. I like it, that's why!!
B0014EVO4M|5.0|This is an excellent soundtrack that is entirely done by Eddie Vedder.  The song that initially attracted me to the album was Hard Sun, it has a strong beat and powerful lyrics.  Then I fell in love with the entire album.  Definitely check this one out.
0553328255|4.0|This is very dumb that it is required that I explain why I chose this rating. I like it, that's why!!
B004V6MWFU|5.0|This entire album is amazing and has a great flow.  Eddie keeps getting better by age.  The lyrics are moving, and point towards a lost love.  You can't go wrong with this album.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have been completely engulfed in this story since I started reading it!  I couldn't put it down. Excited to read the next book already
B007M45PMU|3.0|I was not impressed with this album.  It's not bad, but it doesn't stick out either.  I purchased it for Hey Ho.
B009KEN87O|5.0|This is the best retro game I've found for a tablet, it has levels that accommodate all skill levels. Hope to see more from these folks! I got it as the FAOTD but it would be worth the price if you missed it.
B005IQZB14|4.0|I chose this rating because it was a little too invasive into her personal life.  The description of the trail was excellent.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|it can get kind of boring waiting for things, but it is a great way to pass the time away
B0010SEMP0|5.0|I love this series -- it rocks and the vampires are really hhhoooottt! Buy it you will not regret it!
B008OOYALE|2.0|I do not like this app the first time I played the game I played it for about 2 min.  then screen turned blue. I would not recommend this for anyone who is interested in the app.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The horses are so cute and pretty realistic!! I recommend this game to anyone! It is really easy to become addicted to this game!! :)
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|So I am liking this so far. I have played several of these kinds of games and I really enjoy them.  Most of these are pretty short but I still play every chance I get. Will be downloading more<br />Thanks
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I thought it was good overall it starts pretty slow but as it goes on you start to speed up. there are much more challenges along the way making it so much more fun. try it
B00280LYHS|5.0|Amazing awesome this book is amazing. You are taken through this amazing journey of the half-Bloods I suggest you get this book now no B-)
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Wanted the ending to be a bit more storybook. Happy ending. This wasn't at all what I was expecting. It was a good read though.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This game is very fun and takes some time to beat. I have not bought all the extra levels yet.
B00008LDPU|5.0|I saw the Animatrix almost eigth years ago and I love it, the menus and the music on it, and of course the movie itself, unfortunately I lost the DVD. Years later I bougth the Ultimate Matrix Collection great colection but the menus are horrible considering that is a blue ray edition, so I decided to buy this for my personal collection.<br /><br />Awesome totally recommended for Matrix fans.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Having read this outstanding biography, the title of this review I believe underlies the basic philosophy of Steve Jobs. A man driven by the need to leave a legacy more than any desire to live a life. His inability to experience empathy, his drive, determination, and genius have all undoubtedly been to the  benefit of mankind. But Jobs made the ultimate sacrifice in foregoing his own happiness in the pursuit of his goals; a trait common to all great men perhaps.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I thought it was very well written. I enjoyed her stories, and couldn't stop laughing. She is so great at everything she does...truly talented.
B003DZX44I|5.0|Ordered this dvd for my kids oversees and they love it. It even arrived on time over in England. Would buy again from this vendor.
B005LAIIHG|1.0|This is the stupidest movie I have watched in awhile.  Screaming at the animals to stop attacking while on the boat.  How stupid.  It was so obnoxious and such a waste of time watching it
B003O86FMW|5.0|Although this is not my usual style of reading, I really did like this book.  Now on to the 3rd book.
B0083EW97W|5.0|I think this might be Mayer's best album. It is the perfect mix of Mayer's abilities to weave melodies, while hitting us with simple, yet striking lyrics. It's one of the best coming of age albums I've ever heard. If you love music, you need this!
B0091REZMW|5.0|I cant stop playing.was ger upset tho when I couldn't transfer game to another device. I ha to start over
B002VLNB1Q|5.0|Although not his greatest album, it is still a must have. There are several songs that make this album for me, and because of that alone you have to get the whole album!
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|very good movie! one of my favorite yet and loved how it was based on a true story. I wish they made more like it.
B001AU8ZLK|5.0|I first found Coldplay with &#34;A Rush of Blood to the Head&#34; and loved them. Then &#34;X&Y&#34; was a little bit of a downer for me. To me, &#34;Viva&#34; reclaims the form of &#34;Rush of Blood&#34; but also leading the music in a slightly different direction. Many of the songs are unique on this album, but I just love them. I connect with many of them, primarily the feeling of the music.
0446580848|5.0|WE HAVE BEEN FANS OF NELSON DE MILLE EVER SINCE READING BY THE RIVERS OF BABYLON.  STILL ONE OF OUR ALL TIME FAVORITE BOOKS.  WE SOMETIMES HAVE TO WAIT A WHILE FOR A NEW DE MILLE NOVEL, BUT THE PLOTTING, CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT AND SUSPENSE ARE WELL WORTH IT.
B000FA675C|4.0|If you haven't read Dan Brown I suggest you start here. Get this free book while you can and enjoy.
B006LSZECO|1.0|What? The book started off slow, and I'm a fast reader (I mean I read trilogies in two days) and then the middle got great but this ending? I'm not sure how this made the ny Times best seller
B00122MWBK|5.0|The perfect Goo Goo Dolls album. I don't necessary love every song on their individual albums. This, however, is great.
B002M2T1UO|2.0|the series was terrific BUT the DVDs had some sort of residue on them that meade them skip. (I think it was from the way the series was packaged)
B001BKM3MQ|5.0|There is a reason this album won a Grammy. It's a great blend of Mayer's sounds, and takes you on a ride in a new direction.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I never get bored playing this game!!!! Great fun and entertainment for all ages. Everyone should have this game and its free!!!!
B00973DDN2|5.0|The Killers have regained their previous form. Although this is no &#34;Hot Fuss&#34; it is definitely a solid album. This is a must have for any Killers fan.
B008LA7RM0|5.0|Huge difference in stereo to the simplity of mono, yet you tend to listen more to the mono to admire the skill of the enginering of Brian Wilson.
B005XOPEOU|5.0|I don't know if I can really say this, but this might be there best one yet. For me it is a blending of &#34;Rush of Blood to the Head&#34; and &#34;Viva&#34;. There are many uptempo songs that transition nicely into more subdued melodies. Awesome album!
B00005JLEU|5.0|awesome animation good story. BOUGHT IT FOR MY GIRLFRIENDS BDAY. SHE LOVED IT. HELL YA. BUY THIS. really worth it.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I love this album for it's rawness. These are definitely not polished performances, but in some ways that makes you feel the story line all that much more.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very great game  it's really fun and addicting I can't stop playing it five stars also two thumbs up awesome game
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like this game and its fun it give me time to my self and it gives people time together.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|this cd is very beautiful and passionate.  I especially love the bassa nova beat on many of the songs.  As usual, Andrea's voice is like an angel and I am enthralled with his talent.<br /><br />Right now I'm listening to Andrea's beautiful rendition of Love in Portofino and I wish I was there.  Hopefully, I will soon.
0525478817|5.0|this book is filled with beautiful moments, it's moving and it's humourous! and although my copy wasn't signed, I love it to bits!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved it. Read it in less than a day. Gripping and disturbing, the book captures your imagination immediately and never lets go.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|Always great to see a documentary of forgotten heros in the world. The guy sounds like a compilation of Donovan, Harry Chapin, and James Taylor with the innate ability to give Dylan a run for lyric writing of the times.<br /><br />The second half was learning some more interesting angles on the over throw of Apartied in South Africa.<br /><br />Rock on Sixto!
B00AQB2A3I|5.0|Wilson's latest effort is proof positive that the Prog I loved when I was growing up is not only alive and well, but is flourishing under the masterful hands of Steven Wilson. In five tracks, that sound like much more due to their many &#34;movements&#34;, Wilson pays homage to some early Prog giants while still sounding fresh and new. And of course he puts his stamp on every song- wonderful vocals, instrumentation and composition. Like Grace for Drowning before it, Raven that Refused to Sing will be inhabiting my CD player for a long time. If you are a Prog fan you will love it too.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series continues to get the royal treatment from HBO. All your favorite characters return- the ones that survived - and new ones are introduced, as the battle for the throne escalates. A must see series.
1401310672|5.0|I bought three of these as gifts and everyone has enjoyed them.  I recommend this little book for the entertainment value.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I know I am late to the party on reading this book and much has already been written about it. This book provides tremendous insight into the drive, the passion, the demons and the life of Steve Jobs. As a 20+ year tech industry veteran I can appreciate every aspect of this detailed view into his complex life. It was very insightful to see what drove him, what haunted him and what inspired him. My take aways are focus, work with the best, follow your passion, be curious, and the new mantra for a successful business is simplify, simplify, simplify.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|This is probably the greatest show in recent television history, and this DVD set doesn't disapoint.<br />It has all the extras you might want, and the cast comments are so funny to hear.
6305252572|4.0|This is the only Walter Hill film i'd rate this high (I'd give \\"Streets of Fire\\" a three for chutzpah, \\"The Driver\\" a 2.5 {for four-star driving and 1-star silly existential pseudo-dramatics} and \\"Last Man Standing\\" three because of Bruce Willis and the Dashiell Hammett story {i know it says it's a \\"Yojimbo\\" remake, but it's more nearly the Hammett story \\"Red Harvest\\" that Kurosawa stole without credit for \\"Yojimbo\\"})<br /><br />(After which Toho Films had the chutzpah to sue Sergio Leone for \\"stealing\\" the plot from \\"Yojimbo\\" for \\"A Fistful of Dollars\\"...<br /><br />And it's also the only Eddie Murphy film i'd rate anywhere near this high.<br /><br />Somehow, this film rises above the challenges of being directed by one of the most over-rated \\"hard-boiled\\" directors in Hollywood and starring one of the least funny, over-rated \\"comedians\\" in history (not as bad as Andrew Dice Clay, but then again, who is?).<br /><br />Must be Nick Nolte's presence.
0345525558|5.0|I love reading this book! I can hardly put it down to go to work! Interesting characters and story line is like nothing i have read before this book.
B003EVWDR0|3.0|Watching thts movie is a feast for the eyes.  Absolutely stunning.  It is a wonder they didn't put any money into the script.  The lead character never sells me.  Well, not totally true, I buy he is a selfish narrow minded jarhead.  I just never buy he changes.  His interests do, that is all.  I also have to agree, it is a bit old, to have the outsider be the savior again.  Thank god for us being there for all the natives. A bit tough to watch for those two points, but other that, an enjoyable movie, and again, the eyes will love it.
B00ARA4SLU|4.0|I saw Psycho in the movies when I was 10 years old.  I considered it then and I still consider it now to be the scariest movie ever made.  I read the book that this was based on and greatly enjoyed it.  So I rushed to see this film when it was playing in the movies last December (which wasn't all that easy since it was playing in very few theaters.)  I considered the film to be enjoyable, but not great.<br />The main problem is that the film slows to a crawl when it gets into an (imaginery?) affair between Hitchcock's wife Alma and an author that she is collaborating on a book with.  We are then asked to believe that when Norman Bates is stabbing Marion Crane in the shower, it is really Hitchcok stabbing Alma for her alleged infidelity.  I have read many book on Hitchcock and I have never read anything about Alma and another man, so I assume it to be made up for artistic purposes.  However, it really slows down the film.  While watching the film, I started to wonder about what Hitchcock's daughter Pat and her children thought of this film.  I imagine not very much. (Hitchcock's affinity with serial killer Ed Gein, the basis for Norman Bates, probably also could not have sat well with them.)<br />The acting is fine.  Anthony Hopkins really became Hitchcock for me.  Helen Mirren is also excellent, although I believe he to be a little too glamorous for Alma.  Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Biel were also fine as Janet Leigh and Vera Miles.  The actor who played Anthony Perkins was truly impressive catcing Perkins twitchy mannerisms both as Norman Bates and Perkins himself.  I also liked much of the dialogue that many of us who lived in that period could appreciate.  I especially enjoyed Alma telling Hitchcock to perhaps make Psycho as a musical and to send the script to Doris Day.  (I'm not sure how many of today's younger audiences would know who Doris Day was.  Perhaps they also don't know who Hitchcock was, considering the film's low grosses.)<br />Anyway, this is awell-acted and enjoyable film.  However, the unnecessary subplot prevents it from being a great one.  Too bad.
B008VBYN80|2.0|I was looking for something like clash of clans on the android market. Not bad, but not what I was looking for.
B003B02PF4|4.0|Nice, concise story line as is so common with Grisham.  Held me attention throughout the whole book. Nice twist at the ending.
0140186395|5.0|A great classic written by one of the best!  After seeing the movie on TCM, I wanted to read the book.  It has a lot of back story the movie couldn't fit and is enthralling!
B009GZKO2O|4.0|The story is quickly told. Rodolfo falls in love with Mimi as she enters the room. It is the Christmas Eve and he celebrates a meagre feast with his companion. No income and not able to pay the rent. Mimi collects some fire at Rodolfo and he goes with her to his friends. She is unable to survive the next spring, as a result of her illness. Anna Netrebko sings it very good. Her voice is in the right proportion for Puccini. Her timbre shines in a warm sound. One of her highlights are the arias \\"Mi chiamano Mimì\\" and \\" D'onde lieta uscì\\". Her duet with Rodolfo is one of the most sung arias in the opera world (O soave fanciulla). Piotre Beczala convince with \\"Che gelida manina\\". Another highlight is Nino Machaidze. Her voice had a beautiful coloratura and her aria \\"Quando men vo\\" is the best aria in the opera. The opera is musically sound, as it was in the production of 2008. but the pictures are not so good as in the film version with Anna Netrebko.<br />The production shows the Paris of today. It had reminiscence of the persons receiving welfare aid. It is a uncommon picture but rooted in the soil of today's life.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|really like the TV series and ditto for the book......it seems to be very similar to the TV show so how can it go wrong.......I will read another and hope it is just as good.
B009KEN87O|5.0|best game of retro space ever!!you have to get it nooo[...] would destroy time if you did'nt get so get it...OR ELSE!
B008ROH07W|5.0|I enjoy trumph music and this why  I bought it. I hear about this cd on my classical station in  NC.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is the best game ever.e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e
B007REV4YI|5.0|This product was as advertised, great music that really brought back a lot of old memories.  Good music never dies.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|the graphics are amazing.  My 9year old really enjoys playing this.  This is a great game for adults and kids
B0091V6TF4|5.0|This product was as advertised and funtioned well.  Hard to find product, but this company had it and in stock.
B008J34466|4.0|To me P!nk does two types of songs. Great and crap. I will put up with most of the crap just to hear the great ones. However on this album, the songs that were not great, were not crap either. I think she is starting to evolve and I hope see more like this in the future.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|This product was as advertised and funtioned well.  Hard to find product, but this company had it and in stock.
B009EV7GF8|4.0|I only gave 4 stars, because it was not quite as good as Animal, but still pretty good. Animal was great, but I was not impressed with her second album, so my expectations were little low. I hope to see more like this, since she has a unique voice and it would be a shame for her to fade out.
1419705849|5.0|This product was as advertised and funtioned well.  Hard to find product, but this company had it and in stock.
B00000DCHI|5.0|If you don't like Billy Joel, then you are probably not old enough to appreciate the 70's. I should have added this album to my collection a long time ago.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|This product was as advertised and funtioned well.  Hard to find product, but this company had it and in stock.
B008RYN44U|4.0|I am a huge No Doubt fan, but this album did not quite deliver for me. Some of the songs are great, but some could have used a little more work before release. I love Gwen's voice so much though, she could sing the phone book and I would listen. I am so glad she hooked back up with No Doubt, since the content of her solo music is not as good.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Ben Affleck did a great job in this movie.  I watched it on direct tv and had to have it.  It depicted alot of the actions that happen behind close doors of our government. These people were truly lucky that a few people in our government didn't give up on them.
B009P5S11G|3.0|This album is a mess and she should be apologetic to her fan base. She is very talented, but this was self indulgent and lacked any effort on her part at all. The only reason I gave it 3 stars was because the DVD was pretty good. She is a beautiful young girl with a fantastic voice and very talented. What a shame if she wastes her talents. I'm still hoping she gets her self together soon.
B00B7IJBUY|5.0|I'm a big fan of any thing Bon Jovi puts out.  This album is a mellow Bon Jovi, not like his early albums.  I guess as we age, we get more mellow and tend to look more at the problems in the world and this album addresses some of them.  I would recommend this album.
B00169N0BK|5.0|After using a Color Munkie from a local photo club (4t miles away) I knew that if the price went down at all I'd have to get one.  The instructions are included with the program and although it's not super easy to set up, once you do and then calibrate your stuff, you will have the most amazing prints!<br />Still true and moreso.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|truly enjoyed Pit viewing with the grandkid.  Another family theme movie that came with a message and discussion after the movie.  Pop the pop corn and settle in for a good viewing.  Transmission great in HD.  Movie minus the nudity and violence and not Hollywood trash night at the moview..family movie
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Have to say, this is a fun and interesting read.  I didn't know much about the events this book uses<br />as background.  The main character is feisty.  Her lover is, well, unquenchable.  The descriptions are<br />as much a part of the plot as the characters.
B00AYDC3CG|5.0|Family movie to sit down and enjoy with your grandkids and not have to explain objectionable scenes...Pop the popcorn and enjoy a good movie in black and white
