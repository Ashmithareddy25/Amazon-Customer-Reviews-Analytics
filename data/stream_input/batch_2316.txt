B00BI73CVI|5.0|I enjoyed this movie so much.  Even my husband, who is not a musical production fan, thought this movie was amazing!  Who knew that Anne Hathaway, Hugh Jackman, and Russell Crowe had such strong and beautiful voices.  This is a truly emotional and beautiful movie!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|this is the main game on my kindle. its fun and hand eye cordenition fun fun fun happy happy happy
B0064X7FVE|3.0|this apps ok. I hardly ever use it but it does tell u the weather has ten days forcast yay
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Wonderful. The landscape is so lush and realistic you can smell the trees, feel the bite of the wind and hear the howls of the direwolves. It's so easy to get lost in this book. I cannot wait to read the rest of this series and watch the tv show. If you are a fantasy lover this is a book for you. Even amidst the heavy politics the characters drag you in, make you feel their pain, their triumphs, and their love. It's hard sometimes to pick just one character. Definitely an amazing experience.
0738212415|3.0|I purchsed this book for my 11 year old.  He generally likes to draw character's, people, or anything animated, but this has added another perspective to his drawing.
B0061QD88S|5.0|Perfect gift for my 2 year old niece!  We enjoyed watching it together and it brought back many happy memories from my own childhood!

B00BFUUMO8|5.0|love this game. Only thing I don't like is it takes too long to level up and I wish I didn't have to wait until I'm level 10 to do  the water part. Great game though
1250012570|3.0|Now, I didn't think it was awful, but I really didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would.<br /><br />First love, a very popular subject of books. Overly romanticized often. Including here.<br /><br />It started out slow, with Eleanor and Park just silent bus companions. Slowly their companionship evolved, but man, was it slow. Eleanor and Park seem like an unlikely duo, and I think that is what seems to draw people in. Also, the vintage theme for those hipsters out there. I liked that Park first thoughts upon seeing Eleanor were so honest, his opinion of her unbiased as he was just an innocent bus rider who saw the poor girl struggling to find a seat.<br /><br />Eleanor's feelings for Park were almost abrupt, as in hey-he's-cool-and-his-comics-are-also-cool to a wow-his-hair-looks-so-touchable-and-I-want-to-make-out-with-his-face. Their relationship was extremely repetitive, throughout the whole book they just listened to records or tapes and read comics and make-out. It was pretty typical. It didn't hold my attention that long, and things didn't really escalate until Roger found her stuff and she ran away. Even then, it still didn't get my heart racing. Park just drove her up to Minnesota or wherever, and that was it. I didn't think the commentary when they were saying goodbye was especially heart-warming and romantic. They just sounded like 12 year-olds babbling instead of mature 16 year-olds, supposedly in love.<br /><br />I think  the most real part of this book was Park's mom. I would almost hear her yelling, telling me that dinner is ready in her Korean accent. The visual of her was very clear, so I'd say there was nice imagery.<br /><br />Along with the nice imagery, I cringed every time Eleanor's mom was brought up. She just seemed so hopeless and weak, and the feminist in me just wanted to shake her by the shoulders and tell her to book it. She could do fine just by herself.<br /><br />I thought the ending was satisfying enough, but what if those three words were along the lines of \\"See ya never!\\" or \\"Don't miss you.\\" I guess we'll never know. (Although we can infer that they were I love you but hey, who knows).
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|I heard about this book after reading an excerpt of it somewhere, I cannot remember where, but ok simply forgot about it until I was a able to download it to my kindle. Once I started reading, it was hard to stop. The book delivers on all the GeekChique that is necessary for professional nerds everywhere. Worth the read. And a special nod to the author's inclusion of some of my favorite Douglass Adams reference.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Ending was not great, even though much thought was given to the previous books, you could tell author did not quite know how to end her last book.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Despite occasional lapses, this is one of the finest shows I have ever seen on TV. Excellent character development. One actually cares what happens to the heroes and villains. It is a good study in human nature. Topped off with beautiful scenery and excellent acting, it is highly recommended.
B00BUIX40Y|5.0|bbt - it is fun.  the only thing not to like is the end.  how to say it is fun in twenty non-repeating words, therein lies the challenge.  why can't we get a word count, so we know how many to add?
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The only flaw in this book was, simply, it ending. This story was one deeply rooted  in the complicated intricacies of human sentience, leaving  me feeling empty after I had finished.... Leaving me to ask myself the notorious question : what do I do now that I've finished a book that no other could ever measure up to?
B0064T6LV8|4.0|I enjoy playing this game.  It is good to pass the time while traveling or while at the doctor's office.
B00B09BGQW|4.0|I purchased an earlier CD by these innovative young men and really enjoy it, being a grandma this one is  a little out of my comfort zone, but you know  my 23 year old daughter loves this , just which I would have bought a CD instead of an mp3 download so I could give it to here.  If you are not familiar with 2Cellos you really owe it to yourself to give them a listen.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|I wasn't able to sit through the whole movie.  My husband, a history fanatic was bored halfway through.  A decent movie to pass the time, but was a letdown for me.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Had never heard of this series and am very glad I took a chance on it. My wife and I love Lark Rise to Candleford.
B004LWZW9C|2.0|What do you get if you take a whole bunch of mediocre actors, put them in a film -- in reality, a television show parading as a movie -- and add a holiday that's not really a holiday?  Well, \\"New Year's Eve,\\" of course.<br /><br />There are a couple of actors in this film that I think have talent, but I won't tell you who they are, because I'm such a nice guy that I don't want to insult the others.  But even those that have talent seemed to leave that talent at the door; can you blame them?  Why give any effort when no one else is?  Why not drink some champagne and have a good time?<br /><br />Was I dumb enough to rent this movie, or even dumber by buying it?  Heck no.  It was on HBO or something, and I have free access to premium channels that's just about ready to run out.  So it didn't cost me anything to change to the channel that was showing this \\"film,\\" minus perhaps a few brain cells.<br /><br />What's the moral of the story?  Well, what do you do if you're at the end of your film career, or perhaps at the beginning, and need some work, any work?  Well, you sign on to \\"act\\" in \\"New Year's Eve\\" of course.  What could it hurt?  Well, maybe the audience I suppose.
B002JVWRAY|5.0|I love this series to death, and season 5 would've been a perfect series finale (though there are some episodes afterwards that are seriously entertaining). I know some fans from the start disliked 4 and 5 since it strayed from it's focus on them hunting, or that they brought a religious factor into it. However, there are so many things interconnected with previous seasons, that none of the plot is really lost with the shift and the characters stay consistent (which are problems I see happen with a lot of series). The fact this is also a series that also knows exactly how/when to poke fun at itself and shows that it's aware of just who it's audience is makes it even more entertaining.<br />If there's one complaint I have, it's that this was suppose to be in new, perfect condition, but when I got it, it was unsealed and the slipcase was worn. But that shouldn't take away from how great season 5 was.
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|I didn't even recognize James Spader. And then with 15 minutes left in the film (about 438 minutes into it) I remembered he had recently put on some heft. Slap a beard on him and there you have it.....Mary Todd Lincoln. I was so embarrassed. Enjoy !!
B008OOYALE|5.0|My kids love pet story and city story.  I was hesitant about this game, until I saw that I didn't have to spend money on the gold!!! Breeding dragon eggs in this game is a great way to save yourself from having to buy gold.  This is a game I actually sit down with my kids and play with them. This is a great family game, wonderful way to spend a rainy, snowy day!!!!  Dragons are just wonderful!!!!

B0011UBDTK|3.0|I was so glad to finally have this series and I was so excited to finally watch all of the episodes in their original, uncensored format. However, some of the disks skip A LOT and unfortunately, I still won't get to see these episodes as they were meant to be seen! :(
1616550414|5.0|PERFECT! for any fans and their collections. Completely worth the price.<br />Though if you are buying this for &#34;mint condition&#34; purposes I should add that small parts of the plastic wrap got slightly torn through shipping and handling. Not the sellers fault but worth mentioning. Though this isn't a limited edition so there's no point to keep it unopened, not much value unless it's rare.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|The app helps with all my needs like the weather or alarms and this apps alarm works its not like a lot of other apps that will not even go off on time anyways if your reading this post just know that you should get this app it's 100/ of pure awesomeness
B00AYXNKIC|3.0|As someone who worked through xtrials 2 and winter to get 3 stars on every level, I have to say I'm disappointed.  The game itself, stand alone, is fine but it is not at all in the same vein as the prior two works.  Where you once had to master throttle, brakes and balance (remember pogo-ing from log top to log top?) this release appears to be all about speed, and other than the fact that there are obstacles (which btw don't require a lot, if any skill to negotiate) it has really no concept of &quot;trials&quot; riding.  Like I said, stand alone it works but as a trials game, as a follow on to the two prior games - I must say I am disappointed.
B0091REZMW|5.0|fun keeps on going wit more rooms waiting and plenty of fun quests. if those get dull can always go monster killin
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|This would have gotten more stars if it stuck to the book and there wasn't so much singing. I honestly thought they had turned it into a musical during the first half hour or so. All in all is IS entertaining and well-filmed. The animated version wasn't as long and finished the whole book in one movie. Dragging it out for 3 movies is crass commercialism. The book is only a third of the Lord of the Rings in thickness, why take the same number of movies to portray it?<br /><br />Don't plan on sticking to the book, as this movie is aimed at people who don't read the books but \\"wait for the movie\\" to come out. It will entertain, but will not be the actual story written. It's someone's interpretation of the book to entice movie goers. If you aren't a reader, you'll love it. If you've read the book, you'll only like it.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I'm sorry I wasted so much time reading this book. Just didn't think it measured up to such a high rating.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|Free and fun app. You play a free roaming shark with a constant hunger. Eat what you can and dodge what you can't. Starting off as a Reef Shark the dangers can be pretty minimal (Lion fish, jellyfish, and always larger sharks) but the more you eat the more you grow. Then when full grown you can move on to another shark. Controls are simple and essentially just used to move your shark through the waters and you can boost making your shark zip, line, or even jump out of the water. Controls can either be either touch or tilt to control, which I preferred the touch option, it made it easier to move the shark quickly. This game even has rewards that you can use to upgrade your shark further or even 'dress' your shark flac vest(for mines), hats, necklaces, or even a hook, plus more. But like many apps there things you can use real money for shop special items or in game money(gems) and I'm not really a fan of that and the occasional ads that do show up, including the one to ask me review this game. Overall the game is pretty good, so far. And would highly recommend it... Enjoy!

B009KEN87O|5.0|I don't think any review will do this game justice. This is retro gaming at its best! The sounds, the visuals, the gameplay are all done exactly right. I enjoyed every minute of playing this game. Would highly recommend this to anyone even remotely interested in this genre!
B004VSTP4Y|3.0|This is the final book to the wolves of mercy falls trilogy. I had a hard time getting through this last book for some reason. This book didn't hold my attention as well as the first two. It seemed like it took forever to get to the climax point. It also seemed like there should have been more to the wrapping up of characters and/or side stories. I think a lot more could have been done, but maybe the story was rushed to get on the market. Maybe the author wanted to keep it open to add on more series, but that doesn't look likely. I do like that they kept Sam and Grace`s love alive. Love conquers all.
B00B9LNJ9I|2.0|I was trying to put my finger on what the crux of the problem was, when her live EP came on my iPod, and it hit me.  This album lacks \\"music\\" due to three main issues.  The first issue is that Dido does not actually sing, but takes her breathy vocals to a new extreme.  She whispers the lyrics, making me question if she really feels what she is singing.  There is no passion or immediacy to the song.  These songs could be spoken by anyone, let alone sung.  The second issue is the lack of musicians.  While Dido and her brother have relied on electronics for many of her recordings, it was not as sparse and complete as this album.  Many songs are nothing more than a click track with random sounds in the background.  Her previous albums have had a lush sound to them.  This is just breathy vocals with electronic's straight off a poor Casio keyboard.  And the final issue is the use of the poor rap vocals.  While she has blurred the lines between pop and rap with Eminem, this seems just strange.  Nothing really connects.  There are a few songs that have enjoyable moments, but most sound like unfinished songs or ideas from previous albums.
B0012DP8A6|5.0|Very funny. Impossible storyline and that makes it even funnier. Also provides a good idea of why dentists become dentists.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|it is a great love story.  I can't wait to see what happens to Eva and Gideon in the next book.  My only complaint is that the book is not long enough.  I'm so interested in the story, I read too fast.
B008RV5K4U|5.0|Batman's return and war against the mutant gangs are faithfully brought to the screen in this adaptation.  Peter Weller is spot on as the aging crimefighter.
B003VANOFY|4.0|While I wish the material around your ears was cloth instead of... pleather or whatever it is, I really enjoy these headphones. They block noise and I actually use them on planes while watching movies and blocking out ambient sound (aka crying babies).<br /><br />The other thing I don't like is the dongle is kind of big. Makes it easy to break when you're in a crowded airplane seat.
0385349947|5.0|Forty years ago, I used to wisecrack that women are \\"BETTER...but equal\\" in the workforce, and seriously comment that I will know that there is gender equality when marginally competent women are promoted to the same levels and at the same rate that marginally competent men are. I've worked for far too many mediocrities in my career to think that business in the US has anything even resembling equality. I'm better educated than almost all the men I've worked for in almost my entire career. I hope that women just starting their careers will read this and take this advice seriously. The world of business still has lots of changing it needs to do.

0756697875|4.0|Got this for my son at Christmas.  Less than a month later, the textblock had come loose from the front cover, most likely because of the thick cardboard spacer needed to hold the minifigure.  Contentwise, the book is comprehensive in its coverage of the history of LEGO Batman figures & sets.  Lots of good photos and closeups.
B007MAET4O|5.0|Bravo! I thoroughly enjoy this on Vinyl as it is certainly one of my most listened too albums. John's progression over time has been wonderful and this is by far his best album to date. Walt Grace's Submarine Test, January 1967 is simply a masterful presentation of lyrics, momentum and sensitivity. The theme is less pop inspired but more folk. It's song after song that you could drive across the states listening to. I highly recommend this to any fan of his work.
B004LWZW8I|4.0|This movie was like new when I received it.  It was a pretty good flick...about what you would expect from this type of movie.

B00AMBLXP8|5.0|i love this movie full of laughs and not a dull  moments wish i could have got the movie on kindle instead of rent it
0061726834|4.0|This was another addicting teen dystopian fiction story.  I found it to be closest in relation to Matched because it focused on a government's complete control over the citizen's choices. And I liked the main character, Lena, more than Cassia from Matched because she seemed to be stronger and much less whiny. It wasn't as violent as the Hunger Games (thank goodness) or Divergent although there was some violence throughout the story, I felt it did serve a purpose.<br /><br />In Delirium, love is considered a disease and at the age of 18 all citizens are \\"cured\\" with a neural surgery so that they are incapable of loving others.  To prevent this disease boys and girls aren't allowed to converse or touch and music, literature, and all information is censored by the government.  Lena has been looking forward to being cured so she can be just like everyone else; normal and safe with a husband she is paired with by the government.  However, Lena's boundary pushing BFF (or at least until the cure when she will no longer feel) and a mysterious boy by the name of Alex threaten to change everything in her almost normal life.<br /><br />Lena is a strong heroine I really enjoyed reading about.  Yes, there were times when I wanted to shout at her, but Oliver does a good job at showing her transformation from weak-minded to strong-willed throughout the book.  I admire Lena and would hope I could show her courage and bravery in similar situations.  The ideas touched on throughout this book are very important, and even though they are in an extreme setting, relate to many goings on in our nation and throughout the world today.  Freedom.  How much control should the government have? Is it up to them to tell us something is wrong if it isn't actually hurting someone?<br /><br />One recommendation though; have the second book on hand before you finish this.  I'm still in a little bit of shock as I write this from the ending...
B00A2LFXVI|4.0|No surprises if you're familiar with Miller's graphic novel, but it's nice to see the action leap off the page and into animated form.  It's uber-violent and bloody, so the PG-13 rating is deserved.  If you like your Batman dark and serious, this should be in your collection, along with Part 1.

B00BSBU4EC|5.0|Great movie. My six year old and I really enjoyed it.  Good story and some  really funny parts which helped to offset the darkness of the bogeyman.
B006DHAT5K|4.0|It's no Oscar winner, but it's a pure joy! If you like Ana Faris this is a must! She is at her best and most adorable and Chris Evens is pretty damned easy on the eys to boot. This film is fun, a chick flick yes, but guys like it too. It's loaded with fun quoteable lines and I've watched more times than I will admit, even here.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The book alternates between the voice of the husband and the wife. The challenge becomes weighing their version of events because neither has any reason to be fully forthcoming. What I found interesting though is less the book and how different readers bring their bias to the book. As I read it I quickly disliked the wife while being leery of the husband. My wife reading the same passages didn't trust the wife but found the husband very dislikable.<br /><br />It would be a very entertaining read for a book group with both men and women just for that difference.
0345803493|5.0|I love this whole set of books.  I received them in perfect condition and now my friends are reading them.

Keeping moving forward even in dark times is important. It took a bit to get used to the books voice but once I did,I really enjoyed the read.
B0090SI4OC|2.0|We're only months removed from the final installment of the Twilight series, and there's already another Stephenie Meyer film adaption hitting the big screen.  Obviously, Twilight has quite the large fan base, bringing in a combined total of more than $3 billion worldwide (not including the books) - so the question becomes:  can the first film adaption from Stephanie Meyer since the end of Twilight achieve even a silver of the same success enjoyed by the Twilight saga?  The term \\"success\\" is used loosely here, because even though the Twilight films did well at the box office, they're not exactly the most critically acclaimed films.  However, this newest film adaption, The Host, clearly doesn't have the same popularity as Twilight, so expectations should be tampered as far as the box office gross is concerned.<br /><br />Director Andrew Niccol (The Truman Show & In Time) brings Stephenie Meyer's newest fictional universe to life in The Host, starring Saoirse Ronan as Melanie/The Wanderer (aka Wanda), a member of the human resistance.  Aliens, called \\"Souls,\\" have invaded the earth and humans are forced to live a life in hiding or risk being mentally possessed by the parasitic life forms.  Melanie, her little brother, Jamie (Chandler Canterbury), and Melanie's lover, Jared (Max Irons), are on the run, but when the aliens find them, Melanie sacrifices herself to protect her brother, and is possessed by a soul called, \\"The Wanderer.\\"  However, unlike other humans that are unable to mentally fight the aliens, Melanie's mind is strong enough to resist.  Now, Melanie and \\"The Wanderer\\" are forced to share the same mind, both of whom have very different ambitions.  After convincing Melanie's other inner half to meet up with the human resistance (Melanie's family), they must adapt to a life of inner turmoil, while being pursued by other \\"souls,\\" including \\"The Seeker (Diane Kruger),\\" - the leader of the anti-resistance.  Jake Able, Frances Fisher, William Hunt, and Boyd Holbrook also star in supporting roles.<br /><br />For those wondering, The Host is a lot like Twilight - only different.  Yes, that statement is a complete contradiction, but The Host and Twilight are nothing more than role reversal films.  Twilight focuses on two characters, Bella and Edward, whom are destined to be in love for eternity (or at least over the course of five films).  For the duration of the final Twilight films, the vampire \\"issues\\" play a role in the outcome of their relationship, but the relationship is the ultimate focus.  The premise of The Host focuses more on the alien presence issue and the inner turmoil of Melanie's character, with the intertwined love stories are a secondary plot point.  Instead of a Bella/Edward/Jacob love triangle, The Host features a Melanie/Jared and Wanda/Ian love triangle (foursome if you'd like to get technical about it) - obviously with the two female characters take up the same body.<br /><br />Now the question becomes:  does this film work as a means of film entertainment?  The short answer is yes, it works.  However, there are a series of soap opera-ish interactions that make the film feel overly drawn out.  In several scenes, Melanie carries on conversations with Wanda, which translate into a bunch of scenes where Saoirse Ronan is talking to herself.  Story-wise, it makes sense - but that still doesn't change the fact that there's too many scenes and too much time devoted to one character talking to one's self.  If she were stranded on a desert island, like Tom Hanks in Cast Away, it would be okay, but this film simply has too many scenes that feel like they could have easily been cut.  For instance, there's a scene where Melanie's personality disappears and the only way to bring her back is for Wanda to make out with two different guys.  Apparently, everyone gets a shot to make out with Saoirse in this lengthy film.<br /><br />As far as themes go in The Host - and even though they invaded earth - these aliens display admirable traits about the importance of being polite, nonviolent, and caring about one another.  They're all properly dressed in their perfectly white outfits, spotless automobiles, and to boot - they're always trusting, and never tell a lie.  At one point, Wanda even makes a comment that her species trusts one another and they're on earth to eliminate human flaws.  However, even though they obey these traits, that still doesn't stop the film's incredibly weakly written villain, \\"The Seeker\\" from experimenting with a gun - killing one of her own alien associates in the process.<br /><br />Overall, this is Saoirse Ronan's film from beginning to end.  However, there's nothing special about the way her character is written, but it's clearly evident that she has a knack for the lead role.  Unfortunately, The Host lacks Twilight's attention-drawing action scenes, causing the film to drag on.  Too much dull banter and a less than memorable love story puts this film squarely in the \\"one and done\\" column.<br /><br />Overall Film Grade:  C-<br />FNDNreview.comay admirable traits about the importance of being polite, nonviolent, and caring about one another.

B00AF6B22E|4.0|I never made it out to the movies to see this, but heard it was very good and had great special effects so I cashed in some expiring Best Buy Bucks and bought the deluxe copy (which was the only copy left in the store).<br />Spoiler Alert. Don't read the next paragraph if you plan to see this movie.<br />The plot isn't all that complex. An airline pilot named Whit has been up all night and presumably needs to rush to the airport for a short flight between Atlanta and Orlando. To give himself a little pick me up he does a couple lines of coke. looking not exactly bright eyed, Whit is working with a new co-pilot. The rest of the flight crew are the flight attendants he knows, including his current girlfriend who is his partner in sex, drink, and drugs. The takeoff almost immediately turns bad. I wasn't sure if this was his own bad condition or a legitimate problem, but the plane was shaking like crazy which reminded me of a recent flight I took that left me ill and white knuckled. Once things are stabilized, Whit personally comes out to tell the passengers that it was all a freak occurrence and that everything is o.k. However, he is standing by the galley while making all this comforting banter and what the passengers and crew can't see is Whit emptying three bottles of booze into a bottle of o.j. He returns to the cockpit and ends up taking a snooze (or is passed out) when a system malfunction occurs.  Whit wakes up and all hll is breaking loose. The plane loses altitude, is destabilized, and eventually starts nose diving before it does a 180 degree flip that has it flying upside. Whit manages to pull off the impossible and lands the plane in a field, but not before shearing off a church steeple. Loss of life was inevitable, but only four passengers and two flight attendants die. Whit is hailed as a hero to the extent that he us up there with Sully Sullenberg. Everything is sort of blissful. Whit goes to his farm and destroys what can only be likened to a mini liquor store appears to be shaken enough to possibly change his bad habits ...... for awhile. What Whit doesn't seem aware of, but most viewers would is that they have taken bloods samples that reveal a very high alcohol level and the presence of cocaine. With the NTSD investigating, the airline hires hires a lawyer that will kill the blood test results and all Whit has to do is stay clean and evade and lie. Whit denies initially that he is an alcoholic and that he has a drug problem, but he is so far beyond self control that he proceeds to have a running party with his favorite addictions.<br />I liked this movie but found it depressing and hard to take as the movie progressed. The movie might have been called Addiction instead of Flight. It was brutal, sad, frustrating, and no doubt too realistic. While Whit has something akin to a moment of clarity near the end when it was obvious that the cause of the crash was poor airline maintenance, the ending that was tacked on seemed a little unrealistic based on Whit's abysmal relationship with his son. I didn't things would seemingly heal only fourteen months after the crash and logically trust would have to be earned over a period of time. However, that was probably my only real problem with a movie that was very realistic and very painful for someone touched by alcoholism or drug abuse.store appears to be shaken enough to possibly change his bad habits ...... for awhile.

034537410X|5.0|It took about a month, but after study and intermittent practice I had my first lucid dream the other morning. The W.I.L.D. technique is what brought me to discover this. I was not practicing the technique but it is what induced this enlightening experience. Exploring this realm is life-changing, and if you this is what you want, I highly recommend this book.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is great entertainment as long as not to serious about as there are glitches that can aggravate a player. So play to enjoy :-) Games creativity makes up for its minor inconviences.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I was intrigued by the Idea of the actors singing &#34;live&#34; during the filming of this timeless story. The cinematography, action, and music was captivating. After seeing it in the theater, I knew I had to own it! Beautifully cast and directed too.
B005JZ18IY|5.0|Such a great album.  Ed Sheeran is so talented.  My favorites are Lego House and Give Me Love, but all the songs are great.  I have listened to it hundreds of times!!
B009O2XY12|2.0|I prefer Bubbles Touch to this bubble game. It's an alright bubble game but it didn't hold my interest like I had thought.  I deleted it after about 2 days.
B000W453KQ|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies. package arrived earlier than expected and I will keep this in my dvd collection forever
B002ZG980U|5.0|DiCaprio is deserving of an Oscar for this cinematic masterpiece. Dreams within dreams with reality interspersed requires thoughtful viewing. Absolutely love it!
B007OAAK0O|5.0|This concert brought back amazing memories!  I remember watching this on TV as a young girl and today, it still gave me chills.  Ms. Ross is brilliant.  A true Diva!
B00AA0TJO8|3.0|Mildly entertaining...not much effort required but not much reward either.  I played for about a day and deleted.  Luckily it was free for me.
B005FUTC86|5.0|I got this DVD for a friends granddaughter and she loves it. It arrived ahead of schedule and I would buy another anytime.
B00BMVTS1S|3.0|the movie itself is too drawn out, should have been an hour shorter.<br /><br />i bought a digital copy from amazon and the audio sucks. it does not work well in surround sound modes on my fancy receiver.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Lincoln was a great movie for history lovers! If you care nothing about history, you probably wouldn't enjoy this movie. I personally really enjoyed it.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|This game is awesome.  It puts a new spin on the boring bubble game.  I got it free from Amazon and was addicted, but I had to reset my phone and lost it.  Now I have the free edition which stinks with all the ads...spend the money and get the ad free version!
B001JRB16U|5.0|I got this DVD for a friends granddaughter and she loves it. It arrived ahead of schedule and I would buy another anytime.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I absolutely love tthis game its solo addictive I saw a friend playing and she saidnit was awesome its really addictive andnfun you wofnt regret getting it plus its free!
0316789720|5.0|My son uses this book all the time and he makes great pictures. The drawings are easy and he can add to them to make them even more interesting.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I enjoyed this book. Finished in two days because i just couldnt put it down. There were a few typos here and, but it didnt detract from the story. Cant wait to read the next book in the series.
B008J34466|5.0|I love love love Pink and this is another great CD. This arrived on time and I loved every song.
1433502410|5.0|Very well put together, very good insights, a good price - makes it a very good investments. I recommend it!
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|I have to tap objects in the game about five times before it will actually select it, which can be very aggravating.  The game is ok, it can be a little boring and slow. It takes forever to make money.
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|I played FOREVER and finally got the awesome great white----only to lose ALL progress and revert back to the first shark!!! &gt;:c
B000JMKQX0|1.0|The point of view completely destroys the great possibilities it had.  Reading about the zombie apocalypse through about 50 interviews with different people sucked the life out of this book.
B004XWMXW4|4.0|these 2 artists have sold me on their music with this debute!  love listening to the music at work.  AWESOME!
B009G41CG2|2.0|There is NO HINT, WHEN matching tiles are blocked. Thank goodness this was free.  But you get what you pay for.
B00005N6KG|3.0|Sound quality is excellent. However, these are best fit for men.  The adjustable frame is quite delicate and cumbersome as well, and the cord is too short. (Less than four feet.)
B0095P31L6|3.0|It did not keep my attention.I gave three stars cause it was cute.I would have been disappointed if i went to the theater and saw it.
B00865P3AS|5.0|excellent sophomore offering.  sold me on cello music.... outstanding.  great to listen to at work!  Not what you expect... exceeds all expectations.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Very addictive game that keeps you entertained trying to reach the next level.  Just started game and I'm on level 51 out of 300+, so I have ways to go.
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|It was so great I was 2000 from the great white and next time I get on its reset itself I'm really ticked I wish I could get all the time I put into it back.
B003UYV08E|4.0|After seeing the first movie, I read up on the Iron Man history.  This movie comes, perhaps, from a lesser-known story arc. Expecting some over-the-top bad guy that Iron Man can whip, easily? Nope. Mickey Rourke's character is everything I didn't expect in a bad guy, which is awesome.<br /><br />The scene on the racetrack is worth the price of the movie. That's all I will say.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This book was an eye opener from a scientist in a field where NDE's are considered taboo.  The book starts out with similiarities of previously read NDE's, then takes a sharp turn into exciting on a journey from the eyes of Dr. Eben Alexander III. Things that could not possibly happen occur, and Just as the height leaves you wondering, he brings the book back around and ties everything together at the end. I am glad I read this book, and I would recommend it to everyone.
B007SGM084|5.0|I cold not stop reading this book.  Good thing I didn't buy the audio version and listen to it in the car.  When you read it, you'll know what I mean.  Share it with your husband...
0345528581|5.0|I liked the progressions available to further strength gains where weights or other strength building equiptment are not available.  I feel that the book covers all body sections very well.
B001C08RHA|5.0|Some movies look like the actors would have done them for free, just for the opportunity to play such fun characters. Yeah, yeah, casting Robert Downey Jr was a perfect fit. Gwyneth Paltrow's depiction of Pepper Potts shows who is really in charge of Stark Industries... no matter what Jeff Bridges' character may think.<br /><br />This is a good movie to watch more than once, whenever real life gets too serious.
B0096PYUE2|1.0|I require a flash player on my kindle.  Thought this one might be a good solution.  WOW! I was dead wrong.  The number of adds that pop up from this nasty little guys make the program not worth it.  It feels like i got a bunch of spyware on my kindle.  I had to remove it.
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|Got for my son's 6th birthday.  The while family had fun creating and guessing what others were making.  Also great because you can make the game as long as needed given different attentions spans.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Cool game. Easy to control and many nice levels.<br />If you l8ked space invaders you will love this game.<br /><br />Runs well on my galaxy note 2.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|I had seen quite a few clips and trailers for Captain America, but didn't get around to watching it until after seeing Avengers.  This is how movies used to be. There is an unapologetic tone of Allied good guys (who are just common folk) versus Nazi bad guys (who have unlimited technology and weapons). Analyze the psychology, if you like, but it's more fun to sit back and enjoy the heroics.<br /><br />One flaw, sort of, is that the Cap' puts together a comando team, and it lacks a certain Canadian with retractable claws...
B00BGIBVRG|5.0|This is a great \\"side\\" movie to knocked-up. No you don't see many of the characters from the first movie but it carries Debbie's story quite well! I do recommend parental guidance for crude language, drug use, nudity, and awkward situations. My husband and I laughed so much! Great rom-com!
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I enjoyed the book and couldn't wait to start number two.  I enjoyed the characters and was ready to cheer them on.
B000SLP4SE|5.0|Great movie.  Definitely a movie that does not get old and can watch multiple times.  Love the plot and the action.
B00BSW6F26|2.0|It was quite difficult in places, but as soon as I got into the game, it ended.  It was a real disappointment.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|The game was fun and challenging ! Is there a sequel?  Good story line also  and  and excellent graphics . One of my  favorites.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Great movie! When CR came out years ago I was pretty bummed that they changed actors again for Bond. After watching I was pleasantly surprised and relieved at Daniel Craig's performance. Perfect fit.<br /><br />I was also a big fan of the more realistic and down to earth approach to the 007 franchise.<br /><br />All in all, great movie, great plot, I hope this franchise continues with fervor! I'd like em' early and often!
B001NI5CCY|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies.  Great motivational movie as well.  I recommend this to all my friends.
1451695195|5.0|I liked the descriptions - the importance of family - the feeling of love.  The honesty of the book and the connection to science and body and soul.  A good read.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Use all the time it's  very habit forming...... lots of fun.... recommended for everyone young and old especially for traveling
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I liked this book. It showed that disfunctionality is in more families than I thought. The characters are believeable and remind me of some past friends.
B00A7CI82I|5.0|Great movie.  Definitely a movie that does not get old and can watch multiple times.  Love the plot and the action.
B000UAFDP2|1.0|To me if you have the Dvd version of this movie then keep it because i found out that it does not even work on a blue ray player and that is very annoying<br />So if you like this movie get the dvd version and not onto blue ray forget about it<br />About the movie on dvd i would say 5 stars for DVD but not blue ray so this i am giving 1 star<br />So keep your money and do not get this version<br />Listen to the people who reviewed this item
1476719071|1.0|I have never bought a book from amazon with so many five star reviews that I can barely get through - the last two books I've read (well thankfully there was one good one in between) were real clunkers - how is this getting 5 stars? Is it young adult and I mean YOUNG YOUNG adult because Hunger Games, etc is considered YA but the writing is compelling and not that this book is anywhere near that synopsis wise. THis is about a girl, Abby and this guy Travis who fall in love, he is the bad boy and she is running from her fathers past but the writing is god awful and the story I guess as an avid reader (If I start a book I HAVE to finish it) I find the characters somewhat likeable but for me, its hard to articulate exactly what is wrong with the writing but some books either have it or don't and this book just doesn't have IT ...its a struggle to get through - its oddly reminding me of 50 shades of grey light for what reason I don't know there's no hard sex scenes or anything like that but its so sugary sweet - the \\"bad boy\\" is hardly bad - he's like any normal boy teen I've ever met and anyone who was TRULY bad - the thought of this Abby \\"taming\\" that type of person, in reality, is not realistic.<br />Maybe this is geared for 13 to 18 year olds. I just wouldn't recommend it and the sequal - ugh that would be tortuous....I feel bad writing such a poor review but the book didn't do it for me AT ALL. Needless to say I won't be reading Walking Disaster - this book was a disaster. Really
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|I couldn't wait for this album to come out & its finally here !!!! I LOVE IT!!!!!! ALWAYS LOVE NEW STUFF FROM BLAKE!!!
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|One of my favorite TV shows of all time.  This show never gets old.  I wish I had the same ability Mike has.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Very fun game that is sure to hold your attention over. If you like fruit bunks, you'll enjoy this game as well.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|A great musical is a great musical almost despite the cast. I must admit this version of the Musical puts that theory to the test, but for those who are experiencing Les Miserable for the first time nothing of its majesty and redemptive quality is lost in this offering. Unfortunately for those who viewed the 25th Anniversary presentation, with the excellent preformances found there, any other cast will suffer in comparison. But if one has never driven a porsche a lexus seems pretty darn nice.[[ASIN:B0041G683W Les Miserables: The 25th Anniversary Concert [Blu-ray]]]
0765325950|5.0|It was everything I was hoping for and got here quicker than I imagined. I don't like the requirement for word totals.
B001EJV276|5.0|One of the greatest movies of all time.  True underdog story.  If you need to be motivated this is a great movie to get you going.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I wanted this dvd. Now every day, I get up early so Jillian Michaels can tell me what to do.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Couldn't put my kindle down. One of Sparks best. Anxious to see the movie now. I would highly recommend it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My son is six years old and he is loving this game. It is not frustrating and he never feels grumpy after playing.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|happy to have weather at my fingertips and alerts make it safe for family and friends to know when danger is near.  Nice to be able to check on other families and friends with the locations mode.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love this show! A lot of drama, and is neat to see how people used to live in that time .... even though we all know is a show
1609613937|5.0|The content of this book is an eye opener and should be taught in every school and medical school.<br />It should also be required reading for all state and federal legislatures.<br />This is a research based book that has all the supporting evidence and research that proves what we need to know to live a healthy lifestyle.<br />Dr. Gary Brown<br />Boca Raton, Fl
B0011Z8SPW|5.0|Such an amazing album. Every time I listen to it, I fall in love with it all over again. I recommended it :)
B004LQJPEG|5.0|Set standard of its time..one of the greatest movies<br />Gene Hackman at his best..<br />Have to see it more than once.
B00AHTYI5M|1.0|Grossly over acclaimed- I found it very boring and even the supposed suspense of leaving the the country was utterly weak.<br />How it was so acclaimed beats me!!!!
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|This is the Best version I've ever played!  Excellent graphics, plays faster than others I've played. I've had it for a week and am addicted!
0571238343|5.0|it has a lot of tips and tricks like squash and stretch and so on that really help my 3d animation, all the examples are shown in 2d but the concepts still apply to 3d very easy
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run is one of my favorite game.I love it.I want temple run one.I want temple run three.GET MORE TEMPELE RUN
B007IXWKUK|4.0|The second book of the trilogy finds Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele really working on their relationship issues. Ana briefly left Christian and that was a real wake up call for him, and for her. He realized how much she meant to him and really committed to changing his ways so that she would stay. She realized that she was absolutely miserable without him and that she wanted to be with him if there was any way they could work things out. Christian reveals a lot of his needs, weaknesses and fears to Ana and discusses his past with her, something he'd done only with his psychiatrists in the past. Ana even goes with Christian to a session with his shrink. Ana continues to drag Christian into the light and out of his dark need to control everything around him. By revealing her own fears to him, Ana makes him safe to reciprocate. They still have some kinky stuff in the bedroom, but no one gets hurt and it's all consensual. Christian and Ana both accept that they are worthy of giving and receiving love, and they both are able to express it.<br /><br />I really love the character growth in both Christian and Ana, it's an interesting story with  some strange plot twists.  Book Two is brighter in tone than book One, more hopeful. On to book three.<br />Heat factor hot.
B005URRCUY|5.0|Black Keys... ahhhhhhh..... love every note. You can't go wrong with this one folks. Music for a summer day and then some.
B00BI73CVI|2.0|The movie was very choppy. It keep freezing for a few seconds the continue. I was disappointed. The movie was good.
B0090SI42Y|5.0|A modern day homage to the shaw brothers kung fu movies that inspired the the Wu Tang Clan.<br /><br />The action is consistently brutal and there is a nice underlying hip hop soundtrack which is a tip of the hat to Afro Samurai or Samurai Champloo.<br /><br />A must see for any kung fu movie fans.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I'm 10and I love the game.But what am I talking about I'm only ten.never mind me just download the awesome game.
B000F2C87Q|5.0|You will love this one. A lesser known collection of fine music from one of my favorite bands, but totally playable and enjoyable for anyone that likes great musicianship. They are tight, consistant, and never disappointing.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|The game is fun... but sometimes the pets glitch and on the 1st download it takes like FOREVER 2 load. But other than those issues its awesomeness. And those I hope will be fixed in an update.
B00AFEY354|5.0|Great film!  I very much enjoyed this movie.  If you love the book like I did,  you will like this movie.  Emma Watson is charming, Ezra Miller is perfect as Patrick.  Logan Lerman is Charlie in every sense.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Well dont play this in public u would probably look like u have problems i was screaming me head of almost peeing my self DONT PLAY THIS APP IN THE DARK or when ur camping.... wont ever make those mistakes AGAIN.
B007CKNX28|5.0|It's Jack White - what else needs to be said? Enjoyed this CD from start to finish - not a klunker in the mix. Enjoy!
B0087GF8ZG|4.0|A solid motion sensing night light.  This light has three settings: on, off and auto.  So if you want to use it as a night light and have it on continuously, then you just leave it on and it provides a good amount of light.  I find that it's a little too bright for a night light in an adults bedroom but it's perfect for my four year old who requires more light.<br /><br />If you want to use it as a motion detector, you simply put it on auto and its sensor works well.  It picks up all motion and lights up for about 10 seconds or so.  If the motion stops, the light goes off.  As long as there is motion, the light remains on.<br /><br />Even though the description says \\"hallway light\\" I think this is a great option for side yards, entryways, attics, etc.  It does everything you expect it to do.  It also has two mounting options for ease of mounting.<br /><br />A good solid light.<br /><br />A sample of this light was provided to me for review.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|A great game for all ages. This is one of the best virtual horse games I've come across. You won't be disappointed or bored.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Some of the tables are pretty tough to get through. Hints are limited, good thing. Works well on the Kindle Fire.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|The one true HD heir to the first season.  This sophomore season of the greatest show on TV at the moment is worth every penny.
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|This is our favorite show. It is hilarious and keeps us rolling on the floor laughing. Can't wait until season two comes out.
B00AA0TZTW|2.0|i am a avid Hendrix fan, but this one was just a little too searchy. He was an artist and this was a lot his varity that just did not have that special touch even though there were a few good tunes
B00BKTWBMA|1.0|I never thought I would see the day that the quality of a Eric Clapton release would be so dreadful.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Really liked this book,have yet to see the Movie,but the book was a quick read and made me cry and laugh out load.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Really a great pastime! Fun and easy to play; although, the constant advertisements can get a little annoying. Altogether a nice app to have when you are just bored or want something to do.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|My daughter (who I cant get to read anything) wont put it down. She says its a very interesting read.
B00BR4QNJ0|2.0|little to no replay value easiest defence game ive ever played.  beat it first try through. the three characters to choose from is a good idea done wrong. some levels even once beaten can only be played certain characters.  daily challenges are weak.  svz1 is loaded with replay value the game simply keeps getting harder then it adds 20more levels plus zombies vs samurai mode.  don't even waste the hour it will take to beat this then not want to play it again and just get the first one.  would have given this game a 1 but its free.
B005XDHNF4|5.0|Loved the Legos wedding Fiqures,almost as much as the bride and groom. Was supposed to be for a cake, but the cake was not delivered,so we are saving it for the party in August.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|This app is much better than standard facebook.  It allows you to view facebook as you would on a computer.  It also allows you to better remove unwanted people or pages that pop up.
B008JFLWLE|5.0|Able to solve anything I tossed at it.  100% accurate and very fast.  Able to figure out X. Used a wand pen.
B00BMCLCG6|5.0|I have always loved all Bon Jovi's music including this one. I read other reviews that bemoaned not rocking enough, but to expect the same sound from a band that's been very succsessfully around for 30 years would be boring and indicative of little growth as a band. Grow up. They did! Album is great.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I love John Corey books.  His irreverent machismo makes a very relate-able character and the kind of guy you'd want to go have a beer with.  With that said, I feel this book took it too far.  It seems that after every line from another character, there'd be a smart-ass retort from John Corey.  It feels as if this book was more about his  smart-ass remarks than it was about story.<br /><br />The last few chapters though were very riveting and kept me reading until it was done.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pintrest on my Kindle Fire.... What is not to love!!  One touch and I am looking at boards!  Works great!
B009AMANBA|3.0|Boy, this movie was a huge disappointment.  I can't say for sure what I was expecting, but this was not it.  The movie consisted of long and sometimes painfully drawn out dialogue and little action.  The movie revolved entirely around the passage of the 13th Amendment as a means to end the war, or at least bring the South to the bargaining table.  What it did, for me, was cast Washington in a light not much different than that of today with the bribes, deals and rangling going on for the advancement of one side's agenda.  If they thought to portray Lincoln as a hero, they instead cast him as no better than the dishonest congress he dealt with to gain passage of the bill.  I should have expected no more from Hollywood, but for some odd reason I did.  Overall a huge disappointment and a movie I would not recommend unless you go into it knowing in advance that Washington is crooked as all get out and Honest Abe was not so honest and entirely void ethics.  If that is what you want to see for entertainment, then I would recommend you simply watch the nightly news.

8866130923|5.0|This is the second planner I have purchased from Moleskine and I LOVE THEM. I like keeping everything organized. It makes life a little easier. The sizing can be a little deceptive (the Large for example, is smaller than a normal piece of paper), so pay attention to the measurements before ordering. Other than that, it has a pocket in the back where you can store papers, which is great. It brings stickers as an added cute bonus. Also, it has a built in bookmark string, so you don't have to look for what week you're on.

B005I6EU48|5.0|I think I've had this for about 8 months now? I'm not sure, it's been a while. But I love this cover. It's pretty thick feeling, so I throw it in my purse or my bag for school with no worries as to whether the books in my school bag or the random nail files, coins, knives, whatever in my purse are going to scratch my kindle. The covers binding is more worn in now, and will lie flat, but it still looks amazing. I like it most because I can put it in with my books on the shelf and it looks like a book, not like a Kindle! :)
B004M5AOGY|4.0|Decent movie. I bought it on the cloud as something to try over the next few years. I hope it has staying power.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|This novel removes the rhetoric behind the events preceding the raid and the raid itself. It focuses instead on what the Seals actually do, their mindset, and basically the psychology needed to be part of their team. It's clear there is resentment from the Seals over how the Obama Administration let the details of the operation out. That's not protocol, that's politics. Granted Bin Laden was probably the biggest threat ever neutralized by the Seals, but much less detail should have come out.

B005S9EK5Y|3.0|I'M ALL FOR MUSCIALS SUCH AS LES MIS TO STAY ON THE STAGE AND NOT BE MADE INTO A MOVIE. VERY POOR CHOICE OF ACTORS WITH DISAPPOINTING VOCALS AND POOR ACTING. STICK WITH THE STAGE VERSION NEXT TIME, YOU CANNOT GO WRONG.
B004XQO90O|3.0|This movie was all about manipulating the dreams of a disabled man, with the possibility of assuming someone else's life if he discovers the secret he is looking for. The message is if you don't like the way your life turned out, take over someone else's. Nice make believe if your life didn't turn out very well, but there's nothing here to recommend.
B00AAQRNQ8|3.0|It's light despite all the weights being added. I constantly hit the side buttons on accident. The grip is shaped in such a way that your fingers naturally slide into. As mentioned in other reviews the grip is for looks not for gripping. Customizing color is cool but a waste like others mention as all the other colors are blue. So you can't change the whole thing. Good is that the mouse is accurate and the mouse wheel is smooth. The macro could be good too but I accidentally hit the record macro button and made it hard to click in DOTA 2. Not good lost a few teamfights because of this. I play a lot of fpses as well and you have to lift the mouse often this thing is so big that it really doesn't play well with mouse lifts. I should have went with a smaller mouse. That is my fault. Would return but will cost me half the price. Moving to the kids computer. Probably buying the 12 dollar mouse that is popular here. Smaller and less risk. One of the drawbacks of using amazon returns aren't always so easy. Edit 4/2/2013: Thank you Anker for responding. Overall I don't think the product is bad just not a good fit for me. I do thank you for the offer to refund directly, however I am going to keep the mouse in support of your company. I think you have a good thing going here and I would like to see it thrive. I imagine I will be picking up the Anker 2 or some derivative when you work these few bugs out... Again thank you for being a company who cares. Bumping rating by 2 stars for service.. You can't get better than this.
B000ID37KO|3.0|The first 3/4 of the movie is a long, boring wannabe love story.  I'd forgotten that fact.  If you want to see some mean-assed birds tearing people up, just skip to the end.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is super fun I like my sister likes it even my mom and dad like it it's so fun you feed your Dragon you let it go to collesium  events and best of all you can breed you dragons if you don't have enough Dragon money or gems to buy one at the store my family an I love this game it's so fun
B002ZJCQT2|5.0|I was recommended this book by a friend, and started reading it with my 10-year old daughter who has started to become interested by science. Having a degree in physics, but never having really understood quantum mechanics, I thought this could be an excellent introduction for her, and reeducation for me. It proved to be both, although as the book progressed I abandoned reading it with my daughter as the concepts become increasingly esoteric, and steadily harder to explain... nevertheless, a thorough and engaging book, starting from the basics and working up, and I am looking forward to reading Orzel's book on relativity next... Which is lying beside me as I write.
B008S80OU2|5.0|For my money this is the best band ever. Their complex melodies and haunting lyrics woven around an extraordinary guitar creates a unique sound not heard anywhere else.
B000BB1MI2|5.0|Didn't think I would like this since I am such a big fan of the original but hats off to Johnny Depp he nailed it. Didn't try to copy Gene Wilder gave it his own spin but nailed it. Loved the new tech and graphics but it held close to the original story. Now I can watch this annually as well as the original
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun even the new and old version is fun I wish I can play this all day every day
B007TXN4TK|5.0|Great game. Good for teaching piano too. Love the music. Very fun for children and adults. Recommended to all ages.

0439023513|4.0|Im not going to write a book with my review because that seems to have been done alot, and with good reason.  It is a fantastic book and deserves rave reviews.<br /><br />I really liked all three of the books but was a little disappointed with this one.  With the first two I couldnt put the book down.  With the Mocking Jay I was intrigued but not quite as spell bound as with the others.  During the whole series you wonder who Katniss will end up with (if she lives to the end of the story).  I was ready for a \\"Big Bang\\" ending and I guess I was a little disappointed.<br /><br />Still a great book and yes I recommend it to anyone.
B000HT3P7E|5.0|This show is amazing. If you've never seen this show, start now! Every episode is hilarious and will leave you dying laughing.
B007DIQC90|5.0|This group doesn't have a bad song. This is one cd that I can listen to over and over, the only other group I can listen to over and over is Boston. Long way between those two groups but the creativity and execution is there. The lead female singer's voice is just perfect and the music builds and delivers perfectly.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Very fun. Very addictive. The only thing I don't like is that YO  have to buy gold to get curtain dragons. Other than that  I love this game.
B00C4QWDYY|1.0|Episode 16, \\"Welcome to the tombs\\", shows us how far this series has sunk, from what used to be hilarious, grisly, suspenseful, and original. Now we have the worst horror-movie cliche, a \\"heroine\\" who will be fine if she just hurries up, but she takes her time to indulge in maudlin dramatics and gets...eaten. We don't care about Andrea anyway, because Laurie Holden's trout pout is too hard to look at, and her character's predicaments are all the result of simple stupidity: she just can't see that the Governor is a homicidal sociopath, even though it's obvious to everyone else. We, the audience, keep seeing things before she does, and then we're supposed to endure her endless obtuseness and still cheer for her! In this latest example, Andrea is locked and bound in a room with Milton, the Governor's assistant who is about to die and turn, and then will try to eat Andrea. Milton, still barely alive, urges Andrea to hurry up and use the pliers he left at her feet to free herself, so she can mercy-kill him and escape, before the Governor returns with his strike force. There is every reason here for extreme speed. Death sits across the room from her and the Governor cannot be far behind. Never was it more important to keep one's mind on the task at hand (freeing oneself) and get the hell out of dodge. All Andrea has to do is hurry. But she indulges in long, tragic looks, tries to philosophize with Milton, forms dreamily optimistic facial expressions, and thus fritters away the time she needs to survive. So of course, Zombie Milton gets her. But there is no meaning to it, because she LET it happen! Then we have some more drawn-out tragic posturing when Rick and the gang arrive to find her all bitten open and about to die. Sad music, long stares, reverence. And we're supposed to see her as the \\"Noble Soul who only wanted people to live\\". Walking Dead is starting to get Smallville Disease, where the characters spend all their time bloviating about the Deep Inspiring Meaningof what is happening, but there is no story. Someone needs to reboot this series.
0066620996|5.0|Love this book. Well written and very cool way of looking at companies and what makes some special and others not-so.

B009VSW15Y|3.0|It works for awhile but then it will start messing up. You will go to click on it and the screen will  be  all black. I deleted it and regot it like 5 times and everytime it will work in the beginning, then stop. Waste of money!

B004W2UBYW|5.0|I have to admit I can't write an unbiased review of this book. For many years I have admired Apple, its products, and the people behind them. And those people (like Guy Kawasaki, Andy Hertzfeld, and Bill Atkinson) always attributed Apple's success primarily to Jobs and his vision.  They always mentioned that he was often difficult to take, and seemed conflicted on whether he really needed to be as &#34;direct&#34; as he was. But they agreed that at the end of the day the positives far outweighed the negatives.<br /><br />So: I loved the book. I knew many of the stories already, but I got a wealth of new information and insights about every facet of his life. I found the stories about NeXT and Pixar even more interesting that those about Apple. And while there was some talk about his personal life, there was much more about the products and the companies -- as it should be.<br /><br />When I got to the end of the book (a little abruptly: the Kindle reader on my iPad was telling me I was 78% finished when I hit the end) I was left with an echo of the feeling that I had when I heard of Job's passing: I enjoyed the time I had with it, but I was sad to know that it was over, and that there would be no more.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This is a good app, plays smoothly and is challenging as well as entertaining. Like the ability to zoom and the graphics are nice.

B004GCPJDQ|1.0|I don't know if it's this device, but my mouse keeps dropping out (disconnecting) when using this.  When the batteries were replaced, everything worked fine.  Also I made sure that the mobee was fully charged, with no change in performance.  At this point I would not recommend this product
B0009P5YXO|3.0|Took a few minutes to find the place to put the batteries.  Nice that they were included.  Also, found out the light and buzzer work in the original and extended positions only.  Thought the buzzer should keep sounding as the slide was being pushed out.  Thought at first that it might not be functioning correctly, but I was wrong, and it works just as described in the brochure that comes with it.  Once we got my misconceptions cleared up, it has been working fine and reliably ever since.
B009EEL94Y|4.0|I like it because it is one of my favorite movies and it is in HD  and it has a purpose.

B009NH6JRE|5.0|My problem with Season 2 of \\"The Walking Dead\\" is that it dragged and dragged and DRAGGED. Not the case with Season 3! Wow, so much happens this season and you will be on the edge of your seat the whole time. I won't give away any spoilers, but just know that NO ONE is safe and every single character can and very well may die at any given moment, which is one of the things that makes this show so great. Also, the additions of two new characters this season, Michonne and the infamous Governor, are not to be missed. Both actors bring amazing depth to their characters and really make this season of the show the best yet. Can't wait for Season 4!
B0017HEX76|2.0|Korean? Why didn't someone say something?  Sure, I got it figured out, but since I don't read Korean, it took me over 30 minutes to get it in English with English subtitles. I had to keep hitting and missing over and over again.  This is not what I expected.  Sure, there are some funny words on the cover which you can't decipher on the computer, but give me a break!

B00006AW2M|5.0|THIS ALBUM WAS PUT OUT BY THE STONES THE SAME TIME AS THE BEATLES SEARGENT PEPPER..IT FAILED MISERABLY..BUT BEING A STONES FAN, SOME OF THE SONGS WERE GROOVALICIOUS!! GREAT COVER SHOT ALSO!!
1401941893|2.0|I should preface this by revealing that I am a fan of Hay House books-the publishing company that put out this book. However, this book fails to live up to other titles that they have put out in the past. Basically, most of the advice and tips that are found in this book is a re-telling of advice and tips that I have read in other books similar to this. This doesn't mean that it is a bad book-it isn't-but there just isn't anything new here.<br /><br />Also, while I am aware that Miranda Kerr had an organic skincare line in her native Australia and is a well-known model married to a well-known actor, she seemed like an odd choice for this book. A cynic could say that it is easy for Ms. Kerr to believe in the possible of powerful thinking because by her own account, she has lead a pretty charmed life and a lot of that is based on her being fortunate enough to have won the genetic lottery. However, at least she (or her ghostwriter) comes across as sincere and grateful rather than smug.<br /><br />Over all, this book is a lot like a lot of the Victoria models that Ms. Kerr models with-pretty on the outside with nice photos, but not too much substance. I don't know how empowered the average young woman will feel after reading this, but it probably it cannot hurt them.
B000LTAY1U|3.0|First, for about $60 bucks this is a good watch. The 7s 26 movement is well known quality. The case, hands, and dial look nice. I like the clear case back so you can see the watch movement in action. The strap is the only beef I have with this watch. It looks cheap. Also, the lug width is small and its hard to find a nato strap as a replacement or some other alternative.

B0080SZ0V8|5.0|really great puzzles.loved game.wished it had more chapters. liked some were more challenging than others and if you ran out of time and had to replay you don't get the same puzzles every time.definitely a 5 star game!!
0812416805|1.0|This review is the for the library binding edition, the cover in brownish & black color with a moon and a girl silhouette.  When I received the book, I was shocked at the cheap paper.  The pages are made of construction paper, which are easy to tear and the paper will probably degrade from air moisture in couple of years.  All the pages are bound by a thin piece of cloth like material and that is thin cloth is glued to each side of the cover.  I specifically paid extra for library binding the quality is that of children's coloring books.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|This is another great murder mystery involving forensic anthropologist Temperence Brennan.  Many interesting twists and turns keep the ending a real mystery.  Kathy Reichs uses her own experiences to make her novels so real.  I feel like I've been all over Canada and I like many didn't realize that there are diamond mines in Canada.  I am continually amazed how this author does this in each of her novels.

B009UZLRJE|1.0|As I have a Blueray Player, I orderd discs for this device, however, the discs will not play in my player. I am very disappointed as I love to watch Big Bang Theory.
B004XWLN20|1.0|In the beginning we had superheroes that stood for something that made an impact on comics and on film, then suddenly somewhere along the lines this awful garbage excuse for a show came and destroyed all that was good about one of the best iconic superheroes of all time to be put on the sliver screens. When smallville first started in 2001 during it's first season run it had clark on krypton as a baby for a brief moment then leave for earth as krypton was being destroyed, thus this show begins clark meets his adopted parents, goes to high school, learns about his powers that was all well and good for it's first 2 seasons but then the 3rd season came out and WTH was that this show managed to culminate into some pile of trash put together in a funnel.<br />Smallville the tv show is an abomination it's not the DC universe or for that matter have any true superman mythology implicated in this awful tv show, i don't know why smallville is so stupid but it is and i'll explain why. My first annoyance with this show is that there's so many fictional characters who are not at all part of clark's real social circle that a lot of ignorant smallville fans out there believe to be real in the story of superman, the reason i say this is because when you read a lot of smallville blogs written with comments from the fans you'll see a lot of false facts backed up by fans of the show i.e chloe sullivan, whitney, dr. swan and lots more, i could go on and on and not to mention the stupid made up blue and black kryptonite which clearly does not exist in the superman world.<br />Smallville to me was always a messed up version superman's morals and character. As a fan of superman i don't mind certain changes in the story and clark does make mistakes but those mistakes are not that extreme to the point where Clark tried to elope with a pregnant Lana when she was to marry lex. Clark abandoned lois in season 8. He kept pushing lex away constantly when clark always looks for what is best in people. Clark was always depressed and obsessing over lana﻿ and all that love soap opera jazz garbage that later became this obscenity of a twisted perversion of superman, it felt like i was watching the o.c. or dawson's creek and the irony is that they all came out at the same time all in all i'd say this garbage was not designed for real superman fans at all - horrible main actor, and show all round, Avoid.
0802473164|5.0|I would highly recommend this book for married couples. It's a big help to our family and putting things into practice...
B007REV4YI|5.0|I thought this was an excellent addition to the Bond franchise.  This package gives me four options to play the movie and that is just amazing to me.  DVD/Blu ray give a nice physical choice.  The excellent iTunes copy that seems so rare these days despite complaints over the stupidity of Ultraviolet.  Also an Ultraviolet copy that I consider a nice bonus to the iTunes copy.  All combo packs with digital editions should come like this!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|When you don't have any family to turn to and you think your in this world by yourself you still have to keep strength to keep moving on.This woman is treated so badly by her husband that is a detective, so why would anyone give her the time of day and belive her story? The big house, nice clothes, shoes, that should be all we need right?  She makes a brake for it but her husband is really good at his job. Little does she know there is another good kind, caring detective out there that can read all the signs. There are children envolved that makes her get a little relaxed and distracted (comfort is a wonderful sense of calm). This is when the strength and unknown power pours out of her. Never under estimate the power of little women. It was a page turner of action and suspence and love all in one.
0670026638|4.0|Two stories linked across time and cultures - a young teenager in Japan and a women isolated on a island off Canada....joined together by the mystery of a diary and treasures washed ashore on a beach, creating a wonderful read filled with zen Buddhism, Japanese culture, feminism, bullying, WWII and kamikaze pilots, 9/11, tsunamis.<br /><br />I moved through this book quickly, enjoying the mix and depth between each and every character.  I have thought about this book since I have finished it, which is always a good sign of a great book, it's staying power.  However, I would not put it on my favorites list nor would I call it out as brilliant as other have, but it was a unique and mind bending read, one I am glad that I experienced.  I hope this book continues to grow in it's readership as I will enjoy hearing about what other think of it.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Really fun and very addicting. Just like angry birds but with the movie Rio characters and birds to make it more entertaining.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Let me start by saying that I do not watch a lot of movies and I am certainly not an expert in the filed. However, I loved watching this movie. The plot is very interesting and knowing that is based on a true story makes it even more enjoyable. I certainly recommend the vision!
B003F3NDWG|1.0|CASTLE the Complete Second Season is a great series BUT for some reason this Season 2 collection of 5 DVDs is horrid.  The 5 CDs will not play in any of my DVD players!!!  They can't even be 'read' by the DVD players.  Not a problem with any other DVDs put into my players.  Very weird that it is only the collection of Season 2 DVDs. Gonna return them for sure.
B0060YIBLK|4.0|It was a good, short, informative, read. I liked it and would highly recommend it. Very useful information to use when meeting new people.
1594746168|3.0|This is a really promising premise: Brilliant young 19th Century surgeon becomes convinced that creatures of mythology were actual once-living creatures based upon contemporary genetic mutations and birth defects \\"showing\\" dormant, archaic traits. Increasingly obsessed with the idea, when he cannot find fossil evidence, he begins to create the creatures themselves in his laboratory, using living and recently dead specimens for his experiments. While he is at it, he begins to make detailed, extensive anatomical drawings of the creatures based, he claims, on actual specimens. Increasingly obsessed and persecuted, he and his experiments disappear.<br /><br />The book is divided into two sections. The first is a sort of thumbnail biography of the mysterious Dr. Black; the second is his illustrations. Both have their charms, but both fall just short of the ambitious mark they set.<br /><br />The \\"biography\\" has the makings of a very good short story - the premise is good and interesting and there are some very nice details. The problem is that the very nice details are not enough to sustain momentum and the characters come across mostly as ciphers. No one really emerges to care about, and while it is interesting, it is not gripping. It is perfectly readable, but not involving.<br /><br />The second part, the Codex Extinct Animalia, is a lot of fun to look at, but again, there is something that keeps it shy of being absorbing. In part, I think, it is that while the drawings are very good, they lack a certain quality that imbues the best anatomical drawings. They don't quite live, the way the best scientific drawings (19th C or contemporary) do. IN part, too, while it is interesting to see the insides, if you will, of the minotaur or harpy, these creatures may just be too familiar to us to inspire either shock or awe. I confess that my comparative anatomy is not good enough to know if there is something very clever and subtle I am missing, but I don't think so.<br /><br />Much more interesting might have been early \\"photographs\\" of some of his experiments. The book certainly posits Dr. Black and his work as well-known and much viewed in his day. The technology certainly existed for their to have been accompanying photos of these marvelous and grotesque attempts at recreating (resurrecting) these mythical beings. (Thinking of what JK Potter might do with such a conceit.)<br /><br />Neither fish nor foul, The Resurrectionist, is a noble try and a genuinely interesting idea. The execution just falls a little short of The Satisfactionist.
B00498YZH8|3.0|This was an OK movie for me.  The plot is interesting as was the scenery.  I wonder if it is a true representation of life and family where they live.  Jennifer Lawrence is pretty good in it.
1423140605|1.0|My daughter said she was enjoying the book, after she read page 504, there was a mistake. It went to page 441, continued on from there until page 472, then skipped to page 537. There was no page 505 and a continuation from there. Dissapointed. If you haven't already bought the book from Amazon, my advice to you is to check out a book from a library.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|It is actually easier to follow through the episodes than the UK version I own. We watch it almost every two weeks.. Gets us away from our own problems for a short while.. I like the refined details  of blueray.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|This game took forever to load and I didn't understand it at all!!!don't get it it Sufis and its a bad game I repeat don't get it don't get it don't
B0051XQI84|5.0|A great family oriented story; we watched as a family and the kids loved it. Conveys good morals and why to follow your own path/dreams/desire.
1439102813|5.0|A must read!  I think everyone should read this book.  It really puts it into perspective and opens your eyes to such a sad life.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|those other reviews that say this game is bad are wrong. this is a very easy nice graphic game. i love playing it and am addicted. they used to have glitches but the makers fixed them all. do no think twice aboit getting this games. click the purchase button now!!!!!!!!!!  its free!!!!!!!!!!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great game! No glitches or unusable items. It was well worth the 99 cents and I would have paid more. Much better than some of the other games in this genre
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game is really interactive, especially with live. Sort of an action game, bit really more strategy. I LOVE IT!
B00992CF6W|4.0|the reason why I rate this game 4 stars is because you cant get redstone from redefine ore. other than that, this game is pretty good
B00BU18U82|4.0|this game is amazing!!! I love to play it.  I agree with the other review that it is anoyimg to have to buy all pf the good equipment.  I hope in later updates they will add more crops and equipment.<br />I don't knoewjat you do with the hay bails.  you don't get any money or any thing for them.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Wow, what an adventure? Definitely one of the best books I have ever read. Anthony Ryan, thank you VERY much!
B001PPLJIQ|5.0|I've always been a Kate Winslet fan and I think this might be her best performance to date.<br /><br />There are also creditable performances from Fiennes and Daldry as well.
B00127RAJY|5.0|About me: I am a 37-year old mother who had my two kids in my 30s. With the first one I developed hypothyroidism and so have trouble losing weight. I also have Diastasis Recti from my second baby and so can't do certain moves, like popping up from lying down on my back.<br /><br />I LOVE this video! I cried through it the first time I did it, but quickly mastered Level 1. I started the video a week before Thanksgiving and did it three times a week to alleviate some of the heavy Holiday foods I knew I'd be eating, and I can honestly say that even eating tons of fatty foods for the six week holiday season I did not gain a single ounce - just from doing this video three times a week on Level 1.<br /><br />Yes, it's difficult. And, because of my Diastasis Recti I can't fully do all of the ab exercises completely, but I simply do my best and do what I can. I cannot emphasize this enough: PROPER FORM IS IMPORTANT! And, GIVE YOURSELF A DAY TO REST BETWEEN WORKOUTS! Or, at least, do another workout video so you work different muscles.<br /><br />In more than four months I've made it to Level 3 and feel great! Combined with eating better I've lost 12 pounds and I feel strong and healthy.<br /><br />If you've absolutely never ever worked out before I recommend watching the entire video first and learning, either with a full-length mirror or investing in one session with a personal trainer, how to do proper squats and lunges. I, personally, do 10 minutes of my own yoga stretches first to open up my lower back and hips, which are very tight as a result of my weak abdominal muscles from Diastasis Recti. This helps me, but also I've worked out in the past and know how to do lunges and squats properly.<br /><br />Like all other exercise, you get out of it what you put into it. If you phone it in you won't get results. If you try your best and push yourself you'll soon feel ready to move up to other levels.
B004M8S6FC|5.0|will read more from John Scalzi and will probably like it as I found this one amusing and a quick read.
0857680986|5.0|Great quality of knowledge inside and beautiful product outside! Recomended for all kind of students. Timeless tips and more in this great book.
B00008438V|4.0|Two teenage boys design the perfect female and overcome their insecurities in this piece of genius from John Hughes.<br /><br />This is a very likeable cast and the girl that plays Lisa is hot.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|What a very touching story.  I was completely absorbed by this book!  Learned a lot about dogs and about racing.
B004SIP6N6|5.0|This movie shows that side of retail that most of us working in it don't show to the customers.  It also shows the downside to working retail the verbal abuse that people give us retail people.  it also shows the ways that we have come up with to react to it and how sometimes you just have to return it.  Especially when you know you can get away with it.<br /><br />I also like like the fact that it shows some of the weird and unusual customers we sometimes get.
086547897X|4.0|Some minor injuries outside the book but i think that is because of the long distance transportation. Strongly recomend the book!
B00B2TUKI0|3.0|I have 3 of Madeleine's other Albums and she is HOT!!  However, this one disappoints, felt as if she was just getting thru this new 'setting' of signing.  Her French is flawless, this is just not up to her beautiful voice and delivery.  Sorry, as I really, really love her voice!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I actually like this version better than the original Temple Run. It's a bit more challenging, but more fun. Five stars on my Kindle Fire.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|I haven't had a chance to use this sharpener on any field knives at this point, but I tested it out on some very dull steak knives before putting it in my pack.  The sharpener worked well and a couple of steak knives have been rehabed.  Worth the price.
B00ATPVA78|1.0|I enjoyed the game, but for the price I want more of a challenge &amp; I want it to be longer. Very disappointing. Bought this morning &amp; done quickly thereafter. I would suggest looking elsewhere for a challenge. Maybe my 8 year old will like it!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is not only gripping, it is beautifully written as well.  Hugh Howey puts together a thoroughly enjoyable tale and does it with a vocal flourish that is to be admired.
B004VF68AQ|4.0|of a kick. The album is pretty solid to be honest. It's got some strong slower-mid temp songs, but it needs more of that alternative metal energy that was in previous releases...and some of the slower songs sound too similar to each other at times. I think this is miles better then the overly commercial Strays however. If you liked Nothing's Shocking and Ritual De Lo Habitual with their classic punk meets metal meets Goth rock influences, then you will like this (especially if you like elements of the latter, its got a lot of post punk bits to it). Its a slower record for a band that has been around for 30 years and are not on heroin anymore so I myself was expecting this, not to mention these songs sound pretty good live next to older material. Not a bad album by any means, but I think JA can squeeze another 5 star album out if they go all out.
B006JPS1OM|3.0|Gave it 3 stars. Not finished yet. Waiting for the increase in money.  Hog not very difficult. Don't really care for the cartoon aspect.u
0765365278|5.0|I can't do this book justice in a short blurb. It is long, about 1300 pages, but none are wasted. If you like to immersed in a world that is completely apart from reality this is your escape. Its the first book in a series so you'll have something to look forward to until 2020.
B0091REZMW|4.0|It's a great way to spend some time if you like mysteries. I DO like them and it seems never-ending so the many mysteries just keep coming and changing. Keeps you busy! :-)
6304806434|5.0|My grandaughter loves this movie!  So for her it is the best movie she could ever have gotten.  As for myself, I enjoy it too.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|I read somewhere on one of the reviews that the person did not connect automatically with the device, maybe he did something wrong but my phone connects almost to well.  The only problem that I have when I'm in the house, it is still connected to the device in the car.  So in other words I have to remember to turn my bluetooth off, but even when I turn my bluetooth off and turn it back on it connects right away.  What I think he might have a problem with is the speed of his phones connection.  I did notice that if I just turned on my phone for some reason, it takes a little bit longer to connect.  I believe it's just that the phone is still loading stuff.  My phone is an android, so it could be that it just works better with androids, he did not specify what type of phone he had.  We did not try out two phones, maybe this could cause a problem also.  I will try it and let you guys know if it works.
0307593312|2.0|While I had ordered this book on the basis of a strong recommendation, I quit reading it after a little less than the first 100 pages.  While I don't consider myself unusually prudish in honest presentations of sexual issues, I found myself getting somewhat disgusted with some of this widely-noted author's work here.  After trying to accommodate some of his sexual descriptions as maybe necessary to the plot, I began to find the repeated graphic sexual material as really unnecessary to the story.  It seemed that it was being introduced just for the sake of getting more of that stuff into the story.<br /><br />In spite of Murakami's outstanding reputation, I really am unable to recommend this book.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|I bought the special target edition of this album and had to have it on my phone as well! I wish it had the 2 other songs included as well but the other songs are great too!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|really 14 friggin words are you paying me for this review or what send me some free movies AND i'LL REVIEW THEM FOR FREE
B001C1066E|5.0|I'm a huge naruto fan and i finally found this item. it is exactly as i imagined it! This is a great buy.
B00783NWB6|5.0|I love Kate Bekinsale, she is one the hottest actresses around with great talent!!. I got this blue ray 3d set used  (dvd included),  I'm not disapointed in any way, disc play perfectly & 3d is the new way to watch movies.
B001AMNL2Q|5.0|Full Metal Jacket follows a group of young soldiers from the grueling and punishing boot camp to the violent and unforgiving Vietnam War. Full Metal Jacket is a captivating and thought-provoking war film.<br /><br />The story in Full Metal Jacket is immersive; it takes time to build its characters, which allows a connection with the audience. It doesn't simply throw you into war and expect you to care, and I like that. The film also packs several war sequences during the second half that feel authentic and intense. The ending of the film was powerful and thought-provoking, where you may ask \\"What would I do?\\"; definitely a chilling and haunting ending. Because of how the movie moves and how the characters are developed, it feels like your going on this hellish journey with them; a very immersive experience. The acting was amazing in this film, and so was the music. The cinematography was also beautiful, despite the subject.<br /><br />Overall, Full Metal Jacket is an excellent war film, with amazing acting, authentic war sequences, and a stunning ending. I highly recommend a purchase for fans of war films, a rental otherwise.<br /><br />Full Metal Jacket has strong violence and blood.
0882847953|5.0|Brought these for my boys. I purchased two as the instructor makes notes regarding each child's progress. The books provide beats for the kids to practice. there are no lyrics or real instruction insofar as telling a student pointers. the boys are progressing well using this book with instruction.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game. I love it so much I whould have payed for the game. It is like I am in heaven when I play this game.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Avatar 3d is a great buy!, I have a 3d blue ray set & I'm telling you it's awesome. This particular blue ray disc was in great shape no scratches or defects, just normal wear & tear but nothing significant.
B0012GMUZY|5.0|Classic early Delta Blues style. A must have along with the likes of Son House, Robert Johnson, Skip James, etc.<br />This album being from the early days of recording you cannot expect the same quality of sound you get from modern releases but that actually adds to the experience in my opinion.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I watched Season 1 and 2 on my kindle and am now starting Season 3.  I have enjoyed all episodes.
B003UMW68Y|5.0|My 4 yr old lives this movie!!! I was very pleased with my purchase...i will be buying more movies very soon...
B008FYZIVY|3.0|It would have been outstanding if I didn't get to the third disc and it wouldn't play in my DVD.  So frustrating as I wanted to watch the entire set!  I love this program and just started watch this season so I wanted to catch up!
B004RC8NUQ|5.0|This was a fun movie. Enjoyed it and watched several times when we have someone visiting and the men are watching football
B008YRVW0I|5.0|I'm really picky about games I acquire this game GREAT I would even pay for it.  Don't miss out GET THE GAME!
B00267N3DQ|2.0|Me and my daughter love this movie but be careful who you purchase you're movies from mine was supposed to by the 3 disc blu-ray dvd and features. It was only the blu-ray and  features so now she can only watch it in the family room. Very disappointed and the case looked like a kid had it right before shipping it still had chocolate prints on it!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Fascinating read about Steve Jobs and Apple.  From it's birth in a garage to a Fortune 500 company the story traces the rise of the computer in everyday life.

B007MAETA8|5.0|When did he find the time? Certainly these songs must have been brewing about in his head for several years but all the ruminations and observations have settled here very nicely at last.  When he first made it big I admit, I wasn't into it. For the last ten years the name \\"John Mayer\\" at first I heard in the distance, I had heard maybe one or two songs as a piece of background on the work radio but I knew nothing else about the guy. Probably could not even name his songs, certainly could not tell you the name of any of his records. Oh, and I knew the ladies liked him. In 2006 along came Jonny Lang into my life and that changed everything for me and put even more distance between me and my exposure to Mayer. Eventually I came around to some of Mayer's live performances - a song bought on Amazon here and there, more recognition here and there. Ah, and he won Grammy awards too? So this guy was big.<br /><br />Born and Raised is the first studio album of Mayer's that I have bought and married in the space of a weekend. That kind of marriage doesn't happen often to me. Maybe its because the \\"hippie sound\\" of 70's music feels nostalgic and romantic to me, maybe living in Southern California and having the top of my Jeep down while listening had some influence. Or maybe its just damn good work that deserves worth mentioning over and over again to anyone who will listen. I bought the CD and was pleased it came in a real plastic case with a book of every lyric and pictures and artwork. It was more than the usual offering - a flat sleeve from cardboard. This was the first impression. Something was special here. Probably my least favorite song here is \\"Something Like Olivia.\\" It is not bad, just more \\"poppy\\" than the rest of it. This could have been shed but it wasn't and this is o.k., I can listen to it. I wont even try to pick a favorite. Each of the other eleven songs here are solid contributors to the end product: one very fine, crafty, smart culmination of ideas and thoughts put to beautiful sounds.ghts put to beautiful sounds.
0205313426|3.0|It is a helpful condensed resource for grammar rules and word usage, when writing professionally.  The glossary of grammatical terms is a nice addition to the book.
0062238868|2.0|I had an expectation regarding this book that was not met.  I found that the book was not well written and filled with the authors rebellious distaste for his chain of authority.  The frequent remarks about how his leadership team had no idea what they were doing became tiresome.  Given that he was a Navy SEAL and an incredible American Soldier, I understood how tough he was and did not need to have this re-stated over and over in the book.  I beleive a more humble description of his experience would have made for better reading.  I also found myself racing to get through the last third of the book, it is not a great read and I do not recommend this book.
0525953728|3.0|The book is Reader's Digest easy to read,  Insight and comprehensive content is lacking even considering the security concerns.  Seal's are people and that part outside of the macho professional was not shared.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I really didn't like this book I guess  because I really didn't like Amy and Nick. Especially Amy really made me sick!
B00AEFXZ1C|4.0|...but the videos are excellent, as is the music. \\"Maniac\\" and the title song are especially good, and the dancing is outstanding.<br /><br />And Jennifer Beals is gorgeous!
B00BVYQ832|5.0|AMC has done it again with another brilliant tv series. After watching Breaking Bad I thought nothing could top it. Boy did this show prove me wrong. The plot line and character development is truly a piece of work. I was engrossed from the very start and am still to this day. After being quickly hooked in the first season the 2nd slowed down a bit. The 3rd season then brought the action right back to the table. I cannot peel my eyes away from the screen when I watch it (which is quite frequent by the way). Anyone looking for a great show should check this out. I don't have it in me to watch horror movies but after a while you don't even notice the zombies anymore. Honestly, this show is truly amazing and a must watch.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is unlike any I have read prior. I would recommend this book to any and all teenagers. It really puts things in the right perspective for high school kids. I really felt connected with the main character, I felt what he felt and I was rooting for him throughout the whole book. Easily a 10/10 rating.
B000FDECGA|5.0|This was one of my favorite martial arts films that I had been trying to find where to buy.  The quality of the picture and sound were as good as I remember when I first saw the film years ago.  I'm going to order one for my sister, who is also an old school martial arts fanatic.
B0060MYM3S|1.0|I love the show itself, but I'm giving the DVD set a 1 star review for one reason, and one reason only - the nearly four minutes of HBO promos that you have to sit through EVERY TIME you put the DVD in the player.  There's absolutely no way to skip them (menu button doesn't work, fast forward buttons don't work, stopping the disc then hitting menu doesn't work).  I PAID for these discs, I shouldn't be required to watch commercials for HBO every time I try to watch them.  I won't be buying any more HBO DVD sets, just because of this issue.  Do the companies putting these unskippable promos on their products really think that irritating their customers every time they put a disc in the player is good for business?<br /><br />Update - I wrote the above after watching just the first two episodes.  It turns out the remaining discs don't have the unskippable promos before the menu.  Still annoying that disc 1 is that way though.  Complaining about here probably won't do much good, but on the off chance a DVD producing company should be reading this - most people watching your discs would be more likely to buy other products you're selling if you put the promos as an option that can be watched from the menu, rather than ruining the viewing experience with these unskippable commercials.
B00AJLHU3K|5.0|Love it!  Was caught by the very first song -- was familiar with Richard Thompson but hadn't heard much lately -- this was a great welcome back!  Have only listened to the second CD one time and was not as impressed by that one.  But it's early and probably needs more listening time.  No problems with CD number 1!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|it a great app....I love it.....real fun ..play it in my spare time....give it a five star and a thumbs up.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this game and I can't wait for part 2. If part 2 is 1/2 as exciting as part 1..... I may try to finish it in 1 day! The only part that can get tedious is the back and forth.
B0057UA4FY|5.0|WATCHES IT ALL THE TIME! Bought it as a birthday gift because it was very hard to find in the stores at a low price. After he finishes watching that one guess I will go buy the Complete Second Season! :)
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game is hard but still fun there is so palaces to go and so many things to do.<br />This is one of my favorite games ever!
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|One that will be read again and again; a classic.  Great writing and story-telling.  Gripping and keeps you interested without having too many spots that were boring.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have watched Season 3 over and over and I love it.  I feel as if I know all of the characters personally and I love all of them.  The last episode did not give any definite facts.  It looked as if Matthew was dead.  I hope that they left it open so that with enough yelling from fans that the producers will suddenly decide that Matthew was not killed in the accident.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Something to kill time.  And graphics are visually appealing and game play is smooth.  I am only a level 5, but I can't put it down.
B00AU2B0DE|5.0|His voice is beautiful. The instrumentals are beautiful. Completely satisfied as I expected to be :) I'd recommend to anyone who likes acoustics.
0765334798|3.0|Being a SciFi nut how could the title of this book not strike my interest? Unfortunately the title had me wanting something that this book just didn't quite provide. It's good. Just not what I wanted.
B004YXE438|5.0|This is an app for the puzzler. I am hooked. Great oportunity to modulate difficulty, with great  tableau. Have to be thoughtful when i start as I will not want to stop soon
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|The cast the movie the story............Being that my favorite movies are Godfather and Sarface this is in a class of its own..
B00A77II0U|4.0|This game is cheap and highly entertaining. I loved this game, ive played many and this one is my favorite so far!
B00280LYIC|5.0|It was interesting it inspired Me to write a book on the<br />Roman gods so I thought it was worth a five star rateing
B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|I bought Unorthadox Jukebox first, then this album.  Bruno Mars in a great new talent.  Really loving both of his albums.
B00BSBT8M6|2.0|Not a good movie at all. Waste of time and money.<br />Neither the kids or adults in my house liked it.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I can just play this game for hours on without realizing how much time has passed. And I bet you can too!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This is a fun game, remeniscent of Mario Bros. Everyone in the household enjoys it, including the adults! You won't regret this purchase.
B007M45PMU|5.0|I got this mp3 download on sale for 3.99..for that price it was well worth it. I would have paid more.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! Love this series and can't wait for the next one. Best books ever!! :)
0735619670|5.0|This is one of the best books about programming I have ever read! It is very clearly illustrated and easy to be understood. You will learn a lot of useful knowledge
B004UJN1XA|5.0|This kicks the American's versions ass by far.... its hilarious.  I highly recommend it if you want a good laugh :)
B002G1YPH0|4.0|I have a Gigabyte motherboard (GA-965P-DS3) with a Core2Duo E6300 that came with a Intel heatsink and fan.  At 1.6GHz, at low CPU usage it was between 60-67ºC (depends on room temperature).  After I installed Cooler Master Hyper 212 Plus (by the way, not an easy task), Core temperature now stays between 35-39ºC, but now I hear the fan inside the cpu case.<br /><br />You must be very careful to handle the heatsink radiator, since it is very thin aluminium alloy because you can bend the structure and reduce the cooling effect.
B004GBK09A|5.0|This movie is perfect for a quite day at the house. Check it out the next time you are bored and need something to watch. This movie will make you happy.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I am not one who expresses themselves very well through words - or in general for that matter, but I think this book was influential, profound, and well written. Although there were very few times where I felt Charlie was being a \\"Mary Elizabeth\\". This was a very good book considering it was the first literary work of the author. He seems to know a great deal of knowledge on life - either that or he just has a great imagination, which I think is commendable as well. Anyway, I would read this more than once, and I never really read books more than the one time I choose to read them.
1595825045|5.0|For fans of the animated series this book is a treasure. This book not only highlights the artwork from the series, which is beautiful and highly detailed, but is a great example of how hard work pays off. It shows the long development process that preceded the very first episode, the willingness to revise ideas and the teamwork necessary to pull off a project this large. A good lesson for everyone who watches television and thinks thing happen immediately.
B007PYEY9M|3.0|I thought the movie was just ok, but my boys (6 and 4) thought it was great. Would recommend for a kids' movie night.
159562015X|5.0|I purchased the books for work.  We have a fairly young staff - a lot of them have never worked a corporate job before.  When they start the job, they're asked to read the Strengths Finder 2.0.  A majority of those who read it find it helpful and engaging.  It helps managers understand each person's strengths and to assign tasks to the individuals who are best suited for them.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|So I look at my phone and see a yellow moon on my phone. Then I downloaded the app for my tablet. Same thing. Happy April fools. Ya got me lol Love this app
0786869143|5.0|Interesting summary and data presented clearly<br />I will enjoy trying to incorporate some of the concepts in to my daily routine
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Awesome game not only for fun but education on strategy and war and government. All-around great game for all ages
B00B8PRDHE|1.0|With limited exception of Lukather's guitar chops and Joe Walsh's \\"Rocky Mountain Way\\", this is a pathetic showcase of banal mediocrity recycled for direct-to-DVD dollars.<br /><br />Not only was Ringo void of rhythm throughout his \\"musical\\" Beatles career, but he apparently has no sense of pitch to keep his droning \\"voice\\" in any semblance of a key.<br /><br />Lyrically, the showcase tune \\"Anthem\\" was seemingly penned on the pot by a drunken third-grader...
B00BHU9BV6|2.0|I rented the movie thinking that because it was a Joe's Wright film it was going to be as good as Pride & Prejudice, his 2004 version. I can't say the film is bad. He chose great actors. I just didn't like the scenery, the speed of the film in comparison to other versions and all the details missing in it that you can find in Vivien's Leigh film. What a pitty.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|If you like spy thrillers and drama, this is a good movie. If you don't like spy thrillers and drama, this is a good movie. No matter how you look at it, this is a good movie. The story was great, and by the way true. The portrayal of events was excellent. I was a teenager when this event was happening so this movie brought back some memories and reminded me that in many ways, we are still at war. Some things never change, I guess. Anyway, for the rental price I found it to be a great value in entertainment. If I had paid $12-$15 to see it at a theater, I would not have felt the same value. Schindler's List and Braveheart are $15.00 movies. This one would have been worth $7-$8.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great app would recommend this app to anyone who likes horses or anyone with kids who like horses or any animals for that matter
B00BGIBVP8|2.0|Wow I almost fell asleep. I love Judd Apatow and the actors in this film. it is a shame that it was a bit dry in my opinon.

B00BWJARHO|4.0|Some thoughts on seeing the hobbit movie<br />My reviews are basically written for John and Greg , two old friends who are sensitive and artistic and sometimes like similar things to the things that I find interesting.<br />The movie the Hobbit is nothing at all like the book the Hobbit.<br />I always liked the book, the Hobbit, because when reading the book the reader can tell that Tolkien is realizing the story, creating the story in his mind, relating the story to his larger conceptual continuity as he is writing the story.<br />The reader can also sense that the story begins more or less as a children's book with some interesting wordplay and cute characters, and only as it progresses through the middle and towards the ending does it become heavier and more adult.<br />The movie the hobbit, overall, is a breath-taking rush with a few reflective moments and a few gems from the book.<br />At first, I was disappointed as the hobbit movie started because it did not follow the book.  As the movie progressed I began to realize what was going on and I became absorbed into the story and started to enjoy it.<br />The movie begins with Bilbo BAGGINS writing the story of the hobbit to give to Frodo. As Bilbo thinks about writing the story he briefly re- counts the history of the dwarves and the dragon taking away their treasure and their homeland then the story goes back 60 years earlier and begins the story again like the book the hobbit begins.<br />All of this is a bit confusing and I was very glad when they finally got around to Gandalf coming to Bilbo's door, introducing himself and having the famous \\"good morning \\" conversation with Bilbo. The movie does not capture the cute funny situation that Tolkien wrote in the book. The dwarves do not look like the dwarves as I always imagined them to look they're not nearly as cute and then not nearly as funny and the whole situation of how the dwarves arrive at the door and hang up their cloaks and introduce themselves to a flummoxed BILBO in my opinion was not captured at all in the movie.<br />Honestly, I think Peter Jackson could have captured the feeling of the beginning of the book much better.  I felt that at least as much energy was expanded but not the right tone was set.<br />Even little things like how BILBO  wakes up the next morning and Gandalf reminds him that he's late and he runs off without his handkerchief did not have the same cute fun flavor of the book.  Moving along to the encounter with the three mountain trolls, again, although the trolls were amazing looking, a triumph of CGI, they were not funny like the original book was.  Lots of little interesting memorable parts of the story were rewritten for no apparent reason not to make it better but perhaps to make it flow visually more successfully who knows.<br />And as usual with any blockbusters CGI movie today each and every single scene was overdone. Mountains fighting and dropping rocks on the little group was way over the top the floor of the cave opening up and the dwarves and Gandalf falling apparently miles down into the mountain into a timber constructed trap was way over the top somehow when you read the book you don't get the full impression of thousands and thousands and thousands of squirming wriggling hideous orcs as you see in the movie. The way that the orc king is finally killed is quite graphic and violent in fact all of the endless endless fighting as Gandalf and a group of dwarves try to escape is hideously violent much more so than my impression from the book.<br />Parts of the story, the hobbit, are rewritten for the movie.  This is an interesting development.  Tolkien wrote the story the Hobbit before he fleshed out the story of the LordOfTheRings and before he fleshed out the Silmarilion which was written after the LOTR ( and tells the story of the dark lord before the story of the hobbit ) . What Peter Jackson has done is combined elements of the LOTR story with elements of the eventual prequel into this  movie story The Hobbit.  This is interesting but not necessarily enjoyable or desirable.<br />For instance, Radagast The Brown is quite a major character in the hobbit movie I don't think he is even in the hobbit book but he is an interesting character and probably adds a lot to the enjoyment of the movie.<br />I noticed in the credits that Benedict Cumberbatch plays the part of the NECROMANCER.  This is a little strange because in the movie than NECROMANCER is seen only as a fuzzy black shadow for a few seconds so there must be more of him to come in parts two and three.<br />So, what we have basically is a retelling of the story of the hobbit with out the cuteness and with a lot of flashbacks and flash forwards and embellishments and retelling's and changes and with a lot of breakneck fast movement chase scenes and way over the top CGI.<br />There are some beautiful  poignant poetic unforgettable insightful  SCENES in the movie the hobbit.<br />When Gandalf speaks to Elrond and Galadriel and Saruman at the table outside of RivenDell it is great.<br />When Bilbo confronts gollum on the shore of the lake under the mountain in the cave and they have their riddle game it is great, except that I could not understand everything that Gollum was saying which in effect destroys all enjoyment of the scene because the whole point of the scene that is to understand the  riddles.  But Gollum's acting is superb.<br />The finding of the RING is different from the book, But, it flows nicely and  makes visual sense and is OK.  This special effect the special affect of how Bilbo sees things when he is wearing the RING and therefore invisible works perfectly visually on the screen and is totally successful.<br />All in all, I would have been happier if the movie was cuter, more faithful to the book, and if the dwarves looked more like all of the dwarf illustrations we have seen for the last 50 years.<br />I think it is nice that  SMAUG is not only hinted at but almost shown especially at the end of the movie where he is lying in his treasure trove under the mountain, buried in gold coins but waking up as if he has been disturbed because he senses that Thorin Oakenshield and the other dwarves are on their way.<br />Some of the main themes of the movie are not clearly expressed because the people speaking them have either intense speech impediments because of makeup or they have accents or they have peculiar voices so what they're saying is not clear enough and therefore the themes are not expressed clearly.  I was a little disturbed by this.<br />Again, all in all, this movie the hobbit is probably as good as we can expect.  As a fan and reader of the books I cannot really judge how this movie would impact someone who did not know the story from reading it or who had only seen the lord of the rings movies and now was interested in what happened before.<br />This movie is visually overpowering, stunning, an amazing accomplishment, and very satisfying.<br />So, upon awakening this morning, having slept after watching the hobbit movie, I realize that the parts of the movie that have been playing over and over in my head are a combination of parts from the book that weren't in the movie that I was reminded of by seeing the movie and some of the visuals in the movie that were in the book but not amazing in the book and some of the visuals that are in the movie which were not in the book at all.  For instance,<br />For instance, I keep visualizing the multicolored cloaks hanging on the hooks in the hobbit hallway which is in the book but not in the movie.<br />I keep visualizing Radagast The Brown who iswas not in the book at all.<br />I keep seeing the amazing long involved convoluted escape of Gandalf and the dwarves from the underground caverns of the mountain orcs which, is in the book, but I never quite fleshed it out with visuals.<br />I keep visualizing the scene where Bilbo has to leap over Gollum's head to escape through the gate on the back end of the mountain from the lair of the mountain orcs.  This scene is quite different in the movie, the movie combines the escape of Gandalf and dwarves with Bilbo's leaping through the doorway. In the book, these are separate occurrences and they meet up on the mountainside in the forest after.  In the movie, they are combined in a successful interesting way very satisfying.  I keep seeing the leader of the orcs who has white skin and it's terribly scarred one armed and large vicious,riding on a warg, a giant werewolf, ( to my knowledge. )  To my knowledge, he is not necessarily in the book in any way shape or form, but he is a major player in the hobbit movie part one.  Maybe he is necessary to focus our fear and apprehension in the movie.<br />One of the other complicated, convoluted, and recreated up from multiple scenes, seems in the hobbit movie use again the discussion between Gandalf, Elrond, Galadriel, and Saruman; which, in my memory, does not actually take place in the hobbit book but does help to establish the fact that the dark lord has returned to the forest and is gathering power and is called the NECROMANCER and the character of Saruman,even though he is considered to be the most powerful and knowledgeable white wizard and the leader of the group of which Gandalf is one.  SARUMAN comes across as being glib and thirsty for power and not completely honest so all in all I think that's a successful scene and necessary to tie together the three giant long involved Lord Of The Rings movies with this prequel.shown especially at the end of the movie where he is lying in his treasure trove under the mountain, buried in gold coins but waking up as if he has been disturbed because he senses that Thorin Oakenshield and the other dwarves are on their way.<br />Some of the main themes of the movie are not clearly expressed because the people speaking them have either intense speech impediments because of makeup or they have accents or they have peculiar voices so what they're saying is not clear enough and therefore the themes are not expressed clearly.

Of this being Discworld and Commander Vimes, it's not that simple. A clumsy attempt to frame Commander Vimes to prevent him from investigating a crime backfires.

A good read and one that will leave you thinking about real-world parallels.

B00B5HQLMI|3.0|Some thoughts on the new James bond movie, the third Daniel Craig installment, SKYFALL.<br />The first  Daniel Craig James Bond movie, Casino Royale, was a complete success. Bond looked gritty and sexy, damaged and moody.  The villain, LeShiffe, was a modern take on the iconic Sean Connery-era Bond villain; the story line was believable, ( the villain, LeShiffe, needing money, arranging a high stakes card game in Monaco, Bond infiltrating with a beautiful assistant who of course he falls in love with blah blah blah )  all of the elements were there to make a fantastic moving exciting world class travelogue movie. The director and writer took chances with Bond falling in love and his woman dying and got the audience's full participation and involvement.<br />The second Daniel Craig movie QUANTUM OF SOLACE was not as good but because it started where the first movie ended it already had a narrative flow; basically of revenge against the man behind the death of the woman Bond had loved. The villain was not as interesting and was kind of slimy and the locale although world class was not as rich as the first movie and the finale of the second movie Quantum of Solace was not nearly as satisfying and was basically a big shoot 'em up explosive ending. A SouthAmerican dictator and his thugs against Bond and the girl who was not an agent. Quantum Of Solace did have some fabulous supporting locales and characters which made it almost as good as the first movie. Besides the beautiful girl agent who is killed \\"a la Goldfinger \\" only this time coated with oil the beginning of the movie has some very disconcerting plot lines like M's personal bodyguard had been a double agent for years and no one knew it so you get the impression that MI 6 is not impenetrable but is vulnerable this adds to the general feeling of bond as a free agent able to work outside the system blah blah blah<br />The third Daniel Craig installment SKYFALL upset and surprised me.<br />The title SKYFALL made me think it was going to be about some sort of  \\" Terminator3-type \\" thing that combined North Korea era nuclear missiles with China/ some kind of interplanetary  world class Sean Connery era bond plot . But the exact opposite is true. The movie begins well enough with an incredible chase scene which feels a little bit manipulative but satisfying because that's what we've come to expect.<br />We meet a beautiful agent assisting 007. She accidentally kills him, being ordered by M to take a shot at Bond fighting another man atop a moving train.The next part of the movie is a bit confusing, the title credits involve Bond seemingly dying and are fabulous but after that we are given the impression that he has officially died or been retired because he's a little older and scruffy unshaven and grey and damaged. The next part of the movie is not quite up to par there is someone who has hacked into MI 6 and killed 1/2 dozen people in the main office but while M was not there so we get the impression that someone trying to personally torment her for something she did in the past. Bond follows an unlikely lead to a strange casino somewhere to make a connection with a beautiful woman who is somehow damaged raised as a sex slave owned by someone and in complete terror for her life. Up to this point the movie feels really gritty and interesting. Bond is obviously older damaged bothered by the bullet wound in the shoulder he has a friendly flirting relationship with the beautiful agent who shot him meets the second beautiful woman in the movie who is very damaged. Bond probably has sex with her and then ends up on this island owned by the villain who we finally meet. The villain introduces himself in what is obviously a well thought out provocatively staged entrance where he walks slowly across the room telling a story which we realize we have to listen to because it's the focal point of the movie it explains who he is why he's damaged why he wants to kill M and get revenge on her and kind of explains the relation between him and M. him and Bond and Bond and M and him and M and Bond and if you don't catch all this while he's walking across the room towards Bond you're sort of lost . The next part is very disconcerting and not satisfying and started to turn me off to the flow of the movie . The villain executes that second beautiful woman and that's the only two beautiful women in the movie which I think is the major flaw.  The beautiful agent who accidentally shoots Bond and and then appears time and again throughout the film, and the second beautiful woman that he had sex with once and who is then killed in front of Bond by the villain. So we are left with only one beautiful woman in the movie who is not having sex with Bond and not really interacting with him just friendly flirtation and Bond is completely on his own older grittier damaged moody and we feel somewhat the same way. We feel older grittier damaged and moody while watching the film; at least I did.<br />So we move on to some good parts which are; the oddly simplistic capture of the villain by the MI 6 people with helicopters. He is put in a \\"Hannibal-Lector-type\\" cell where he doesn't seem worried he explains that  he wants revenge on M for M's betrayal of him and trading him for some other agents years ago when he had overextended itself , so he basically admits that he was bad that he was punished by M and that's why he doesn't like her and wants revenge on her. The second part of his wanting revenge has to do with him trying to commit suicide by breaking the cyanide capsule in his tooth as agents are instructed to do and instead of the cyanide capsule his tooth contained another drug which damages the inside of his head or throat or sinus, causing him to have an implant kind of like a artificial bridge top part of his jaw which he pulls out and shows us how physically damaged he is and this is supposed to make us horrified and feel really sorry for him but of course you can't fool sorry for him because he's an unrepentant vicious villain anyway.<br />The next part of the movie goes into the realm of Mission Impossible because when the young Q hacks into the computer of the villain we are shown some kind of ingenius living algorithm. While the youthful Q is trying to break the code , Bond of course spots something on the screen and helps to break the code which then allows the villain's computer again to hack into the MI 6 computer before Q can stop it and opens all of the some kind of subterranean doorways to underground London.  Bond of course realizes that this is how the villain was planning to escape and he rushes to the cell our villain was in and then follows our villain on a chase on and off packed subway cars through the underground until the villain (  when Bond has a chance to actually stop him decides to wait for a few seconds while the villain )  activates a bomb which blows open the roof of the subterranean passage allowing the subway train to fly in and a fabulous violent scene allowing the villain to escape. All of this money and all of this planning was spent just so he could walk in and shoot M in front of a prime minister and a bunch of investigators in a closed session. Of course Bond and the girl agent and Ralph Feinnes as the assistant PM have a big shootout in the room and stop them which is rather anticlimactic. The villain escapes again and Bond decides to do something really off the wall and kidnaps M leaving a trail for the villain to find her so the villain can finally kill M.<br />At this point in the film they decided to commemorate 50 years of James bond by Daniel Craig bringing M to a lockup which is what the British call parking garages or car garages he brings M to a lock up where the original James bond Aston Martin is kept in pristine condition and he drives away ,  instructing Q to leave a trail so that the villain can find them.<br />At his point in the film I turned to my wife and said , \\"So when andwhere is the title name SKYFALL going to enter the movie and as I said the words Bond drives to a remote area of Scotland with M , turns into a driveway were an Irish deer sculpture is on the pedestal at the entrance to the driveway which has a sign on it saying SKYFALL. We then realize that Bond has brought M to his childhood home we find out the names of his parents when he left that he was an orphan we meet the crotchety old Scottish caretaker who just happens to be hanging around with a shotgun and we are entertained to the anti climactic ending of an older Bond and older M and an older caretaker setting booby traps and preparing to be invaded by this villain whose only intention is to kill M. After a rather boring and uninteresting shootout chase across and moors the action ends with M's death in the chapel. The movie ends with the beautiful assistant agent giving bond his inheritance from M's will, which is an ugly British bulldog statue she used to keep on her desk that he always hated . Then, we are once again reminded of the 50th anniversary because we find out that the beautiful agent assistant who's been assigned desk duty her last name is Moneypenny , her office looks like the original Sean Connery James bond reception office where he comes in ( and if you remember throws his hat on the hat rack )  so Daniel Craig walks in meets Moneypenny, then enters the assistant prime minister's office and receives his next assignment.<br />The movie needed a better finale. Perhaps a better reason for the villain to want to kill M or a better way of killing her or getting his revenge on her.<br />The movie needed at least one or two less damaged beautiful females.<br />What would have saved the movie is if Bond had somehow repaired himself a little bit more physically so that he looked a little better and was more fit because he decided he needed to be a little more fit to deal with this if they had introduced another female who was not damaged but perhaps was as interesting as Bond almost like a partner and then if they had set the finale in something or someplace a little more exciting flashy or interesting and not done a shoot-em-up with explosions but instead have done some more intellectual intriguing type of competition or contest this movie would be as good as Casino Royale as it is it's not as good as Quantum of Solace so they started out with a perfect movie the second one was less perfect and the third one is even less interesting. And I really like Craig as Bond. And the Amazon Blue Ray rental was kind of fuzzy which hurt the experience a little.fool sorry for him because he's an unrepentant vicious villain anyway.<br />The next part of the movie goes into the realm of Mission Impossible because when the young Q hacks into the computer of the villain we are shown some kind of ingenius living algorithm.

B008HK3XKO|5.0|Good quality, holds up well, looks great on my kindle.  I would recommend this cover to my friends.  Good price.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|The acting is definitely not as good as the second, but the plot and the character development are just as awesome. I love it!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I was stationed in Yokosuka, Japan when I first watched \\"Harry Potter And The Sorcerer's Stone\\" film at a late night showing.  I am also lucky to have watched each of the other seven films at movie theaters.  This 8 film collection includes a short synopsis of each movie and in chronological order.  The eight movies featured (for those who may not have yet got the chance to watch the films): Harry Potter And The Sorcerer's Stone, Harry Potter And The Chamber Of Secrets, Harry Potter And The Prisoner of Azkaban, Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire, Harry Potter And The Order Of Phoenix, Harry Potter And The Half Blood Prince, Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows-Part 1, and Harry Potter And the Deathly Hallows Part 2. The only catch is that one must have a strong desire to get this collection for strictly the movies. The obvious reason being is the inclusion of all of the Harry Potter films to have been released, but extras are not included.  Aside from that caveat, this complete 8 film collection of Harry Potter is best for those who enjoy fantasy films involving friends who unite together to overcome spiritual tests in life

B00A83075M|5.0|Yes, you may say that the idea is similar to Toy Story. But that is what is so genius, they built on an idea, and made it into an awesome movie. And anyways, isn't Toy Story just a step above The Brave Little Toaster?
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|This movie was dry, crass, typical, and lackluster at best.  But what else should you expect from Hollywood?!?!<br /><br />We paid $5 to rent through Amazon instant video and I would like my $5 back along with an additional $5 for pain and suffering.<br /><br />Paul Rudd plays the same character in every movie and every time he gets less and less funny while remaining the typical schmuck that he is.<br /><br />The story was dumb, the characters were dumb, and every minute that passed was worse and worse.  We watched about 15 minutes of it and gave up.<br /><br />Don't waste your money...I did.

B0094KF4WG|5.0|the story about the assassination of UBL was a fascinating read and full of special forces action.a good book to buy !
B005LAII4E|4.0|Let's start by stating the obvious: the plot is far from credible, basically akin to the simplicity of a cartoon supervillain with an over-the-top plan and he needs to be stopped by the good guys.<br /><br />Still licking their wounds from the insufferable G. I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra (2009), our super-soldiers led by Captain Duke (Channing Tatum) introduce the pace of this movie with an action sequence against overseas enemies.  The down side: after a successful mission the president orders an air strike to kill the whole team and frames them for some pretty serious war crimes, painting them terrorists.  They lose a lot of good men.  But the best of them, thought to be dead with the others, made it out alive...and something smells fishy!<br /><br />What's that smell?  Well, it turns out that the president of the United States has been kidnapped by Cobra operatives, with one of them impersonating the president with some sort of nanotechnology that perfectly emulates facial structure and voice.  There's are first heaping spoonful of over the top.<br /><br />Cobra operatives' next step is to free their imprisoned Cobra Commander, who is in an underground super prison, and then bluff a nuclear coup to disarm the world's nuclear powers and then threaten the world with a new, special weapon of their own design.  Waaaaaaaaay over the top.  When you see the world leaders meet to discuss nuclear disarmament it feels like a 12-year old wrote out the drama.  But, I guess this movie is for the 12-year olds, too, so I'll leave it alone.<br /><br />Roadblock (Dwayne \\"The Rock\\" Johnson), freerunner Flint (D.J. Cotrona), the sultry Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki), Snake Eyes (Ray Park) and Jinx (Elodie Yung) face off against Zartan, Cobra Commander, Storm Shadow (Byung-hun Lee) and Firefly (Ray Stevenson).  There's also a painful ninja clan cameo by rapper-filmmaker Rza, who reprises his woodenly stale performance from The Man with the Iron Fists. Bruce Willis also joins the Joes.<br /><br />The action sequences vary in quality.  I found the movie's opener to be a little weak.  But later sequences and, especially, the mountain ninja clan battle between Snake Eyes and Jinx and Storm Shadow's minions was quite good.  Likewise, a battle between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow along with Jinx training with Snake Eyes were also quite cool.  Leave it to the ninjas to save the day.  But they can't take all the credit.  Flint's freerunning assaults on Cobra, Roadblock versus Firefly, the Cobra Commander prison break and the big finale offer a lot of entertainment as well.<br /><br />This movie is as entertaining as your ability to check your brain at the door and try to remember the scenarios you were playing out with action figures when you were a kid.  All the sudden, \\"the president needs saving again\\" starts to feel more natural./><br />The action sequences vary in quality.  I found the movie's opener to be a little weak.

Likewise, a battle between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow along with Jinx training with Snake Eyes were also quite cool.  Leave it to the ninjas to save the day.  But they can't take all the credit.  Flint's freerunning assaults on Cobra, Roadblock versus Firefly, the Cobra Commander prison break and the big finale offer a lot of entertainment as well.<br /><br />This movie is as entertaining as your ability to check your brain at the door and try to remember the scenarios you were playing out with action figures when you were a kid.  All the sudden, \\"the president needs saving again\\" starts to feel more natural.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|But all in all this is a great game that always has something to do. Though I rated it 4 stars I think that it would deserves 5 if IF you could play without internet.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book make u want to read the entire book at once, just luv it , ANA is my kind of girl
B00A8ECU24|4.0|It's a awesome app but when ever I play t that little mini game I have to pay 25 gems and I never get a PONY!!!!!!!!!!!so you should really get the app but just don't play that mini game.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Who doesn't like angry birds? It's free and after you finish each episode, the next challenge is to do them all perfectly. It's harder than you might think.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|Not only is this book funny, it is also really well written.<br /><br />The characters all seem real.  Which is funny to say thinking about what this book is about, but it's true.  It's hard not to give spoilers for the book, but aside from being funny it really makes you think about what constitues a real life.<br /><br />If you're a character based on someone else is your life your own?  The codas really bring home that thinking.<br /><br />If I say anymore I may spoil something I feel is special.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.
1616550414|5.0|Ever a fan, this is unbelievably good. Really good quality, fantastic from page to page. Beautifully laid out, and fascinating to read.
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|They put to funny people together in this movie but it just was not the funny. I think they should have made it a little less dramatic.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This is a great social game. I love all of the different options and goals to attend to. It's nice and time consuming.
B002ZG974M|3.0|I purchased this for use in my Sociology class because it demonstrates very clearly how culture shapes human beings.  &#34;Babies&#34; is not a film I'd recommend for entertainment--unless you like  watching babies grow and learn.
030758836X|5.0|A great and realistic story.  It was surprising how it ended. I don't know if their married life would have endured.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Love their youtube clips, they should release a DVD version with all the clips put together, instead of just the CD.  Miss seeing the visuals to go with the music.  Hope to see them when they come to Dallas.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|subway suffers is a awesome game and is good for little kids you get to jump on trains and collect mystery boxes and do lots of fun and awesome other stuff I love subway suffers so much and I hope you like it too. I LOVE SUBWAY SURFERS!

0385349947|5.0|After watching Sandberg's TED talk, and reading a few interviews with and articles about her, I expected to like this book. But I didn't expect to love it.<br /><br />I can't think of any other business book that I've read as voraciously. I've read reviews that complained that the book had too much data, and too many references, but I appreciated that Sandberg backed up every point she made. It took the book beyond personal anecdotes and made it feel more solid. Though, I really enjoyed her anecdotes -- combined with the extensive references, they were both entertaining and effective.<br /><br />I've also read reviews that complain that she's too successful, spoiled, entitled, etc. etc. and is \\"tooting her own horn.\\" I'm sorry, but that just makes no sense at all.<br /><br />First, I don't think the author should have to apologize for coming from a family of means. I don't think that one can argue that her success is entirely due to the fact that she came from a family that could afford to send her to Harvard. Clearly, it helps to have a family that can afford an excellent college, but the rest of her accomplishments were things she worked for.<br /><br />Second, who wants to read a book of advice and coaching from someone who ISN'T wildly successful? I don't think Sandberg is saying that everyone can follow in her exact footsteps; she acknowledges that she has resources in her life that not everyone else has. But, I do think she is making an honest effort to inspire other women. And, frankly, her success should be pretty damn inspirational to all of us.<br /><br />Lastly, I can't remember ever reading such eviscerating commentary about a successful man. She's gotten twice the number of one-star reviews than Donald Trump's 2008 book (and he's the king of self-promotional bluster!). Not one of those one-star reviews for Trump complained that he's \\"too successful\\" to give good advice to the rest of us. If anything, the amount and type of negative blowback that Sandberg is getting underscores many of the points she makes in this book.<br /><br />It's not that I'm saying it's not fair to dislike the content of the book; to each their own. But, most of the negative reviews aren't about the book, but about Sandberg herself, who by all accounts is intelligent, hardworking, articulate, and likable. Her biggest crime is being a successful woman who dares to presume that other women might be interested in her perspective on the challenges that she -- and all of us -- face, both in the workplace and at home. Quite telling.<br /><br />At any rate, having finished the book myself, I feel both energized and hopeful. Sandberg manages to turn some fairly depressing statistics into a rallying cry and, for me, it worked. She beautifully summarizes the bittersweet realities of working motherhood, acknowledges the different ways of \\"leaning in\\", and provides solid advice for women at almost any professional or personal stage.<br /><br />The overall effect of reading the book is feeling like you've just spent a few hours getting solid advice from a very successful friend, and hoping you get a chance to hang out again soon.g is getting underscores many of the points she makes in this book.<br /><br />It's not that I'm saying it's not fair to dislike the content of the book; to each their own.

B007ZXK08C|5.0|It is written in such a different way,so it does grab your attention.It is written from the husband's perspective and from the Gone Girls point of view also. So the mystery unfolds,is she gone and what had happened.It is all there . I loved it .
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I can't believe I have my own copy of Les Miserables now! Thank you for delivering it ahead of the scheduled time! The comb was the perfect choice, because I've got the different Bonus section for each medium. I watched this wonderful movie on my tv as soon as the pack arrived! Thank you!
B0081SRJSY|2.0|Cannot get the program to run. It starts to load and then closes down. I have played this gae before on my DSI.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Love this movie on 3D! Fantastic pictures! Came with a Blue-ray 3D and a regular DVD. This is my first time to try pre-order. Works great.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Love the tv show and now reading the comics....a little different but what a story! Would recommend. Not just another zombie book.
B001M0HGR2|5.0|Quality was good and there was no noticeable pixelation. Four bucks is a fair price given it's HD and I could not get it on Netflix.
0062238868|5.0|While CPO Kyle's passing weighs on his family, friends, and teammates, this book does what every warrior asks of his epithet - remember how he lived, fought, loved, and served his fellow man rather than remember his passing.  Hooyah, Chief.  Bravo Zulu.
B009CGYO0K|5.0|I know these cats, I live with them every day.  This book gets the cat daddy's seal of approval.  5 stars.
B008MWBY6W|5.0|Fit in the bottom of my backpack to carry all over Disney world. Great quality!  I would highly recommend this.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I loved the book but wished it had a slightly different ending!  It was a very easy read. Kept me guessing the whole time.
B008VO3PA4|5.0|I love cats and poetry.  The book has delightful photographs and whimsical poems about cats.  I really enjoyed reading it.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|Love this game BUT as soon as i got to level 10 and acquired the water park it crashes and refuses to open again. Downloads constantly and it always crashes! Frustrating! !
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much I had this game for a while and I never stop playing this game Is really great.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|Like all the songs.  Britney reminds me of a newer version of Janice.  Love her voice.  Songs are great, too.
B005LAII44|3.0|As stated in some of the other reviews, this movie has some killer action stunts.  I do like the action in this movie.  I also think the acting is good.  \\"The Rock\\" does a great job in his part.  Bruce Willis is also great and the other actors play their parts well too.  If this movie was named something else I would give this movie 5 stars; however, as a G I Joe movie it is missing.  I think the writers left some stuff out.  Your next question might be \\"What did they leave out\\"?  Well I never herd \\"Yo Joe\\" once in the whole movie, there was only one futuristic weapon in the whole movie, and too many of the well-known Joe's die.  The other Joe movie at least had futuristic weapons and yells the catch line often.  In this movie, the weapons were standard guns and I repeat no catch phrase in the whole movie.  The acting was better and it had a better story line other than G I Joe movie other than the already listed flaws.  As a lifelong G I Joe fan, I can only give this movie 3 stars.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|OUTSTANDING movie! Absolutely loved it and the fact that a young woman was the one who, after years of gathering Intel with the CIA, zeroed in on the exact location of Osama Bin Laden is INCREDIBLE! What a great movie. Expect that the beginning seems to *start off slow* -- be patient -- when our Seal Team 6 finally went in, makes it so worth it! I loved the way the movie laid the background, first. It was exciting for me to see the preparations...Years of it! WOOHOO!!!
B0043UB0EI|5.0|i love all spartacus andy or not. all good shows keep u on your toes great plots great action and great romance sad to know last season is on

B00AF6MF9I|4.0|So far this game rocks. No problems but internet requirement is sometimes a problem. Overall the game is alot of fun.
0767817478|3.0|I have been a Godzilla fan since the beginning in the early 50 (I am 72). I know they were hookey but I loved them and still do. As the years progressed Godzilla went from defender to terrorist. whos' bright idea was this? The English voiceovers got worse. From the Japanese speaking broken English to the finally speaking perfect English to me is a travisty. If they must, use Japanese who speak broken English to keep in line with the story.  I introduced Godzilla to my eldest grandson when he was 7 (now 11). We have watched all of the movies together for years. When Godzilla 2000 came out, he said it was \\"sucky\\" and put his nickle in the wirty dord bank (dirty word).  I know we have to keep up with the times but sometimes we just need to leave well enough alone.  A few of the newer ones are okay but the characters speaking perfect English takes getting used to.
B00AFYZDL2|5.0|This is my FAVORITE Saxon CD! After last years dissapointing \\"Call To Arms\\" I thought Biff and the boys had lost it. I WAS WRONG! Every song here kicks ass. The production is PERFECT! Every instrument is mixed perfectly. This stands shoulder to shoulder with the last two ACCEPT CDs. (Wow would THAT be a good tour!) I mean this CD is melodic yet totally BRUTAL. I have EVERY Saxon CD and this one I just can't get enough of. WELL DONE BOYS!!!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Excellent program, I highly recommend it!!  The show was wonderful, the DVD arrived very quickly. a great shopping experience.  order it now.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Love this DVD! I did it consistently for 6 weeks after never working out consistently in my life and definitely began to see definition in my stomach and legs. I am a busy mom and it is awesome that I can see such great results with only using 20 minutes of my time. I definitely recommend.
0375701427|5.0|As Mr.Roth recently said in an interview, he knew America was going off the rails in the late 60's. but it took him more than 20 years to have the perspective write about it. And the time he waited worked its magic; this is the deepest and most profound book I have ever read about that dramatic, disturbing era. It's Roth's deepest book, a tragedy and yet also suffused with the humorous perspective that shines throughout Roth's long career.<br /><br />Others have described the plot in detail. I will add that I was teenager for most of that war and a young adult when it winded down, and I saw up close some the angry radical reaction among the young to that awful war.This literary masterpiece resonates so very true to the feeling of that era and ties it to universal and timeless themes of family, love and loss. A literary masterpiece, and the probably the finest of all Roth's fine books.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Book was good but I don't think the bad language was necessary, it would have been better without .  I enjoyed it otherwise
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Definitely worth the money was a fun game could have been a little longer but all and all a enjoyable game love the G5 games
B00A3XWB10|5.0|This Cd brings on the Thunder. The Guitar's are working in this hot new music.My group has had to change out their lead singer, a few times but, they have it going on now for the style they wanted to keep. Happy with the new ROCK CD...
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Addicting. Love this game! I unfortunately played it so much that I can't go any higher in the game. Can't wait for the next version.
B00002N9ER|4.0|works great! wish a &#34;cutout&#34; came with it so I could of lined it up easier. but besides that functions great!
B00992CF6W|4.0|The reason I'm making this review is because this game is worth one.  Two reasons I gave it a 4 star.  One it's so expensive which I can tell it has a lot of tools and plus it gets boring after a while which stinks because you waste the money im a young girl so that's my opinion
B0012NIF56|5.0|There is always this debate on whether Superman 1 or 2 is better? IMO Sups 2 is, its my fav out the the Reeve movies. If your going for the original or the Donner Cut, just get both. The Donner Cut is better as far as a movie as a whole (more action, cars blowing up, ect), but i prefer the beginning and ending in the original theatrical released version.<br />If you have young children, all 4 Reeve Superman movies are a must see. Even though part 4 is HORRIBLE, they will thinks its one of the greatest movies ever, atleast i did when i was 6 years old watching it for this first time. :)<br />My order of the best Superman movies...<br />#1: Superman 2 The Richard Donner cut<br />#2: Superman 2 Theatrical version<br />#3: Superman 3<br />#4: Superman 4<br />#5: Superman Returns<br />The new \\"Man Of Steel\\"comes to theaters June 14, 2013, and it looks EPIC!!!!! Im sure that movie will be pretty high on my list here! :)<br /><br />EDIT:<br /><br />Well, seen the new \\"Man of Steel\\" in theater twice already in 3D,here is my updated \\"Best Superman Movies\\" on my list...<br /><br />#1: MAN OF STEEL!!! Yes, it's that good!!!!!!!!!! Hoping and praying that the BluRay has the entire Hour of footage taken out of the theatrical cut!<br />#2: Superman 2 Donner Cut<br />#3: Superman 2 Theatrical version<br />#4: Superman 3<br />#5: Superman 4<br />#6: Superman Returns
1616550414|5.0|All I can say is EPIC!!! love this book the only game missing is he Zelda's that came out on the Panasonic CD-i.......LMFAO!!!!!
B0045HCJ9E|5.0|This is one of the best Hitchcock films next to Psycho. This film stars, Cary Grant  as Roger, an ad salesman who is mistaken for a spy, by the name of George Kaplan.  He is on the run;  for a murder he did not commit; but was framed for by Phillip Vandamme. Who is played by James Mason, most will know him from Salem's Lot . He encounters a counterspy, Eve, played by Eva Maria Saint. Roger is chased from NY to Mount Rushmore trying to find the truth;  is he on the right side and who should he trust. Should he help Eve when Vandamme finds out who she is truly working for. This movie is great you do not have to be a Hitchcock fan to love this one. It keeps you glued from the beginning to the ending. I hope this review helps you out, I do not want to give it all away; but you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />THX,<br />Kris L. CocKayne
B0041O40EI|1.0|There are two versions of this puzzle - one that is very nice and one that is of a lesser quality.  The product photo is the nicer quality puzzle.  The product shipped was the lesser quality puzzle.
B000002B2T|2.0|I don't understand the overwhelming 5-star support for Above. With the exception of \\"River of Deceit\\" and one or two other tracks, I've always found this record to be boring and uninspired. Layne sounds as good as ever, and everyone plays well, but the songs just aren't there. There are a couple of good riffs, but the band fails to do anything exciting with them. With the new reissue, I revisited the album to see if time might grant a different impression, but nothing's changed...Above is still as disappointing as ever. What could've been a knockout with the talent on board instead is just another forgettable side project.

B0030DBGXY|5.0|Extremely sharp out of the box. Can easily shred a card board box just for fun. Great for wilderness use or showing off to friends. This knife is my first laminated blade and I'm shockingly surprised at its high quality, even though I was quite skeptical at first. San Mai III steel is quite amazing and leaves a good first impression. Glad I made the purchase.<br />It arrived from amazon in excellent condition and was packaged like they were expecting it to travel through a hurricane. This would be a great buy for anyone looking for a good fixed blade knife. Love it.

B008FYZIVY|5.0|I came, late in life, to enjoy historical England. The first two seasons carry the aristocratic family and their servants through the upheaval of WWI. There are characters with great heart, and mean, petty characters keeping things shaken up. Maggie Smith is an actress who should never be missed.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|\\"Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking,\\" by Susan Cain, is an excellent read for every individual along the Introvert to Extrovert spectrum.  As an introvert herself, Susan Cain blends her love of books and logic as a lawyer to provide a rational, fun, and compelling story as to the value of introverts in our extroverted society.  Intriguing stories and fascinating science weave together to offer valuable insight as to how to leverage the strengths of both introverts and extroverts to maximize our working environments as well as our familiar relationships.<br /><br />This book was particularly helpful in regard to the role of introverts in negotiation and conflict.  Introverts tend to dislike conflict and are more \\"quiet\\" than extroverts; however, they have \\"unique powers in negotiation.\\"  Introverts' tendencies to prepare thoroughly, to be even-tempered, and to be deliberate in their word choice and style provide a foundation to exercise strong listening skills and employ the value of asking good questions.  Whether negotiation is of particular interest or not, the bilateral angles offered throughout \\"Quiet\\" provide meaningful and practical insight for everyday life.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Downton Abbey Season 3 is a continuation of the lives the English aristocracy trying to exist past a World War that left their way of life redundant. The lives of the downstairs contingent are as absorbing as the upstairs people.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Along with many others, I love the Walking Dead.  Great show, great characters even though sometimes you want some zombies to come by to thin the human heard.
B005ZUR724|5.0|I'm a pretty picky person with games, and I can say that this game is amazing! Very user friendly..no lag..and the gameplay is surprisingly easy! You'll love it :-)
B0063IH60K|5.0|I downloaded a few casino and card apps for my Kindle Fire HD, and this is my favorite so far.  There are ads between games, but no problem for me for a free app.  It is easy, fun, and addictive.  The problem is putting it away once I start.
B002UWH8P6|4.0|I've always enjoyed the Stargate series since the first movie came out years ago. The concept and  storylines and acting were done very well
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|this game is lots of fun it can get hard at tomes but that makes it fun definately worth it plus its free so you there is no risk
B004ZRV3AU|1.0|Trash, that's where this needs to go. Not worth your time nor money to buy this,<br />Does not work as they said it would.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is simply amazing. I love it because there are so many unexpected turns along the way. The only thing is that the ending is such a cliffhanger. Oh, and that I've gotten in trouble for not paying attention to what's around me because I'm to absorbed in this novel. This is actually my fourth time reading it! Anyways, I strongly suggest this book.
B007REV4T8|5.0|My Husband is a HUGE 007 fan and he wanted this one. He has all the others and he said this one was great also!
B0086AYAQ6|5.0|I discovered Valentina through her YouTube videos and this CD does not disappoint.  I bought this based on her performances of Fur Elise and La Campanella, but the Rachmaninoff prelude that starts the CD is now my favorite.  I wish she'd release the Chopin etudes in CD/MP3 form as well as the DVD that's currently available.
B00APJLFEG|3.0|Just something to watch to pass the time, get a few laughs.  Okay as a rental.  Not much you can write about.
B003B02PFO|5.0|This book was written incredibly well.  I laughed from the beginning to the end.  I would never though it was a book written by John Grisham....but absolutely surprised!  I loved it!
B0009P66TK|5.0|This is my first leather band watch and before I purchased it I was a little bit skeptical but I decided what the hell and just purchased it. When it finally came in I put the watch on and it felt perfect. An amazing business casual style watch which is perfect for my job (sales). Now I am looking for more of this style for my collection
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|I watched this rather long and boring movie and almost shut it off half way through. Not nearly as funny as I had expected, in facdt it was more drama than comedy. Not so good drama at that.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great game lots of fun! Can play it for hours and not get bored! Would definitely recommend it to anyone!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved this book from the start to the finish!!!  Characters are totally engaging and the twists are turns keep you reading.  Awesome book!

0345803507|2.0|I'm going to copy my review from my GoodReads account here. I already said it all there, and there's not much I could add to it. Here I go.<br /><br />The first book I actually enjoyed, even though the writing is pretty awful. The second book I was bored, but I persevered, and continued on to this one. I honestly wish I hadn't. Not only was it boring, but the whole thing just fell extremely flat with me, and sadly I am hearing there may be a fourth book due out in December. And as if the dullness of this book wasn't enough, there is this little tidbit that completely put me off of it at the end. If this was earlier in the book, I probably would have stopped reading right there, but I was nearly finished, so I continued.<br /><br />Ana & Christian have just had sex. She is quite pregnant with her second child, a daughter. This follows:<br /><br />\\"How's my daughter?\\"<br />\\"She's dancing.\\"<br />\\"Dancing? Oh yes! Wow. I can feel her.\\"<br />\\"I think she likes sex already.\\"<br /><br />Wow E.L. James! Way to make your two characters we've been following for roughly 1600 pages sound like a couple of pedophiles. That was just sick. Joking about your unborn baby liking sex, from her own father no less? Disgusting, really.<br /><br />If there is a book four, I will pass on it. That dialogue has put me off of these books for good.
B00BU2SIW4|3.0|this can be a hit or miss with many people for me Im on the fence with this one..I have been a long time fan since 86..I understand its art for them and always reinventing themselves..some of the song drag some are ok all in all its all right listening ..
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The the Hunger Game Books are a great read.  Many twists and turns that I could not anticipate.  The book kept me engaged from beginning to end.
B001FVV2X2|4.0|I started watching this series when trying to find something different to watch. This is more &#34;believable&#34; than X-FIles, but has the same feeling. If you have an open mind or are into conspiracy theories, this is the series for you. I do not feel compelled to watch the second season, it didn't hook me that much. But, I probably will, since it wasn't that bad.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The idea for this series is so awesome, and really  made great books.  If you like this you should read the gregor underland books.  Keep it up Collins

B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I liked the first book. The second was kind of a letdown. The problem with the third book was that it was an inevitable fail. If you liked the dynamics of the first book, the third is nothing like it. However, the setup of the first book, the oppressive capitol, the uprising of the people, demanded some kind of resolve of the force behind the hunger games. I realize that we must address the overthrow of the capitol, but the intrigue and cunning of the first book was lost in translation by the time the third book came around. I found myself skimming through many pages of this book because I was so BORED. I agree with other reviewers when they say that this book seems to be like a bad storytelling by a colleague trying to tell a ghost story at a company retreat. It was WOW this happened, and then THIS HAPPENED, and then, and then, and so on. The ending seemed lackluster and improbable, inconsistent with the rest of the story. And what happened to Primrose? It seems as though her role was an afterthought just slid into the story once the writer realized she forgot to address this plot point. Bottom line, you will want to read it to get closure on the story, but you will be ultimately disappointed once you're through.

B003O86FMW|2.0|I would give this book 2.5 stars if allowed. It seems like the writer was rushed to throw together a followup to book one. I liked the beginning and the idea of the quarter quell, even the stories about what happens to victors after they've won. But as soon as the enter the new arena, it's downhill from there. Plot holes and inconsistent characters aren't even the biggest problem. It just felt like, oh we've got to make this bigger and better, lets throw this crazy obstacle out, oh and you'll never believe what happened next. Blah blah blah. The most interesting parts of the book are the parts that happen outside of the hunger games. Boo.

0307352145|4.0|Susan Cain attempts to understand and redefine what it means to be an introvert in her book Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking.  In today's society, both in business and public life, a great deal of value is placed on the person who displays a large, vivacious, and engrossing personality.  These are our extroverts, these are our leaders, and this is our ideal.  Susan Cain approaches this book from a personal place.  She is an introvert trying to work in a world that places a tremendous value on being an extrovert.  Her book is an attempt to show the introvert why they are the way they are.  Most importantly, she argues the paragon of extroversion isn't always the best fit.<br /><br />Early in her book Cain partially builds her definition of an introvert as to how a person's brain, their amygdala, responds to stimuli.  An introvert has a different physiological response than that of an extrovert.  Typically, an extrovert's amygdala is less reactive than that of an introvert. This sensitive amygdala is what gives an introvert stage fright, or shyness in front of strangers. This theory doesn't hold true 100% of the time, as extroverts can also have a sensitive amygdala.  I used to think of myself as an introvert-extrovert, but I've come to recognize that I could be one of those highly reactive extroverts.  This apparent paradox is critical to understanding that introversion and extroversion is not a binary proposition.  A person may display traits of each type. Obviously, people are not bound by the reactions of their amygdala.  Extroverts can learn caution and restraint, while introverts can become public speakers.<br /><br />While the US has typically placed a premium on a person's extroverted personality and dismissed the loner introvert, we don't always find that this is the case in other cultures.  One noted example of the opposite being true falls within Asian cultures, where activities associated with introversion: studying, good grades, and discipline, are both encouraged and rewarded.<br /><br />Growing up, my father would often lament about my seemingly introverted ways.  I liked to read, think deeply, and was slow to warm up to strangers.  These are qualities typically associated with introverts. These concerns came from his own introversion.  He would constantly struggle against his inclinations and force himself to appear to be an extroverted dynamo.  As a trial lawyer, his career depended on this. My mother is the classic extrovert.  Where he requires isolation she needs stimulation.  Cain argues that my father's learned extroversion and my parent's pairing is quite common. As opposites attract each other, and introverts learn to survive and thrive in the workplace.  However, what can we learn from the behaviors of introverts in both the work place and at home?<br />Understand that an introvert will (typically) be methodical, cautious, and grounded.  One must be prepared to give them the time, and space they need to process information and situations.  Expecting an introvert to be able to break out into an extemporaneous discussion is not playing to their strengths.  In fact, quite the opposite is true.  When negotiating with an introvert one must take these factors into account.  Disruptions of any kind do not play well to their strengths.  Further still, knowing an introverts inclination towards pensive and thorough consideration should be maximized.  In fact, if you consider the basis of a successful negotiation to be rooted in preparedness and mutual understanding between parties, having an introvert plays well.<br /><br />My take away from this book comes primarily through the exercise of simply understanding what makes an introvert act the way they do.  When managing or simply working with an introvert one must be aware of their traits so that they can be the best they can possibly be.  Providing an environment that maximizes their experience is critical.  So please, let us haveour offices and cubes, and let's let the open floor plan fall the way of steno pool.<br />On a more personal note, I am now leaving this book with a better understanding of myself, my family and my colleagues.  The running joke in my family was that my dad would disappear from family parties promptly at 9pm.  In fact, their first marital disagreement came on their wedding day.  His invitation read that the wedding would be over at 5pm with the reception promptly ending at 7pm.  The other guests received an invitation that indicated that the reception would go until 11pm.  Over time, they have learned to compromise - she does all the talking, and he just needs to stand there and not until the appointed time when he's allowed to go home.

0553801473|1.0|Just finished a Dance with Dragons. If by dance George means a lot of new characters, and dragons a lot of descriptions with no plot line development, then it's a dance with dragons. I had to force myself to finish this book. I just wanted to see what, if anything, happened. Nothing did. I loved the first 3 books of this series, even tolerated the fourth one, but this last one. I get that he likes cliff hangers - but did anyone else think he was so intent on creating cliff hangers, he forgot to write a story?<br />I have also learned not to like any characters - why? I think George trolls his own blogs and book discussions, determines which characters people might like, and makes sure to mess them up in order to show readers there are no \\"good\\" characters. He is trying so hard to prove that no characters are \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" that it is becoming cliche and predictable.<br />Here's hoping book 6 might get back to the quality of books 1 through 3.

B007STBUIW|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock once said \\"blondes make the best victims. They're like virgin snow that shows up the bloody footprints.\\" Think for a minute about arguably the most famous females in Hitchcock's films: Marion Crane in Psycho and Madeline Elster in Vertigo. They're both blonde, and they both suffer terrible fates. Steven Spielberg was obviously influenced by these two films, and the proof lies in the fact that his first victim in Jaws is also a blonde young woman.<br /><br />This is the most Hitchcock-esque of Spielberg's films, and arguably it's also his best motion picture. Famously, it is often acclaimed and sometimes blamed, along with Star Wars, as the death of ambitious American filmmaking. Is this the case? Or did Spielberg and George Lucas see to re-invent ambitious American filmmaking in the form of a summer blockbuster?<br /><br />Although there are a handful of great blockbuster films, Jaws is arguably the greatest. It is greatly supported by its three lead actors, it showcases some of the finest editing in a motion picture, and it has a score that, according to Spielberg, is the reason for half the film's success.<br /><br />Based on Peter Benchley's novel of the same name, a shark is violently harassing Amity Island, and kills two people before the mayor of the town decides to do anything about it (he claims he doesn't want to close the beach on the Fourth of July weekend). Martin Brody (Roy Scheider), the chief of police, is appalled that the beaches weren't closed immediately after the first victim.<br /><br />His luck turns when a Marine biologist called Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) shows up to investigate. A great white shark is identified as the underwater devil, and when it has its share of a third victim, the mayor finally gives in: he closes the beaches and allows for an expedition to kill the shark, which is undergone by Brody, Hooper, and a professional shark hunter called Quint (Robert Shaw).<br /><br />Some of the power of Jaws lies in the relationship between the three men: Quint is stuck up and proud, while Hooper takes many pre-cautions and will hardly crack a joke. Their personalities clash, and had it not been for Brody simply being there, the shark might have killed both of them. Brody is the man standing in between them, the one that holds everything together. And what also makes this trio work is the character acting, as this has perhaps the strongest acting of any of Spielberg's films.<br /><br />It would also help that Jaws has a really strong screenplay. It is not Sunset Blvd. to be sure, but it has perhaps the most accomplished dialogue and character dynamics of any blockbuster film. Every character that needs to be strong is strong, and Spielberg's direction is intense and heightens an already great experience. And the pacing is excellent, clearly the best in a blockbuster film. There is almost no delay, and the first two attacks come swiftly and then almost evaporate. It shows off what a phenomenal director Spielberg was, and it shames all blockbusters made today.<br /><br />Another lift from Hitchcock is the dolly zoom effect. In Vertigo, it is used to show Scottie's acrophobia. In Jaws, it is used almost as brilliantly: when another shark attack occurs in the broad daylight, the effect is utilized in a close-up on Brody's face for reasons of fear after a wonderfully suspenseful buildup. (Disney would also use this in The Lion King for the stampede sequence.)<br /><br />The third lift from Hitchcock is the scene in which we see the shark for the first time: up until about the last 20 minutes or so, Spielberg only shows the shark's point of view or a few fins. But when all is calm and Brody is making a joke aboard the boat, the shark appears for about a split second in all of its glory, prompting the film's most famous line: \\"You're gonna need a bigger boat.\\" And for the benefit, this is continued until the climax, where the shark is exploited and we already know how much of a threat it is.<br /><br />The facts are these: the shooting schedule was only supposed to be 55 days, and filming concluded after 159 days. Imagine what editor Verna Fields had to deal with, having so much footage to put together into a two-hour motion picture. Her work was honored with an Oscar for Best Film Editing, and that is a sign of where the Academy made the right decision.<br /><br />Then we have the score, and this is (at least the argument I'd make) the film's most valuable aspect: this was the first of many amazing scores that John Williams would write (the long list includes Star Wars, Superman, Raiders of the Lost Ark, E.T., and Return of the Jedi). To say it's one of his three best scores is the equivalent of calling Hamlet one of Shakespeare's three best plays: an honor that is not to be taken lightly. The dissonance in the main theme of a minor second (E and F) creates as much disturbance as the shrilling strings in the music that supports the shower murder in Psycho. And the interval is played on exactly the right instruments (basses and cellos, if I'm correct, and as the music intensifies, it is also played on violins, violas, and at the end, trumpets).<br /><br />Often times, Spielberg is criticized for sentimentality. There is no such thing as sentimentality in Jaws, and one of the reasons is because this is not a fantasy. In the trailer, one of the taglines is \\"none of man's fantasies can compare with the reality of Jaws.\\" In this film, there is no sugary treatment, and that's what separates it from the rest of Spielberg's works: it is the epitome of his action/adventure films, and it is his best film because it plays out like the most real adventure of all time.<br /><br />Still the question stands, though: did Jaws and Star Wars destroy great American filmmaking? I would say no, particularly in the case of the former. And the main reason is because all of the elements of the film, especially in the screenplay, are handled with such care, and a good screenplay is seldom seen in today's blockbusters. Both films shed light on a new opportunity for filmmakers, but most of the care is in the action: it can be frivolous and big, but there must be something justifying it. In the cases of Jaws and Star Wars, there was absolutely more than one thing justifying action and visual effects.r /><br />The facts are these: the shooting schedule was only supposed to be 55 days, and filming concluded after 159 days.

B002U5HKZ6|5.0|The book serves as an encyclopedia about Mumbai, as well as our spiritual world. Having travelled to India once, I found the first half of the book particularly intriguing, its characters full-fleshed and its descriptions about Mumbai(the villages, the train, the slums) vividly dancing on the paper. The author has succcessfully established memorable characters through the chapters - Lin, Karla, Prabakar and many others, with heartfelt flow of emotions. The latter half, though faster-paced with a lot of actions, seems lacking in something. The main character has developed into some type of hero who survives all sort of emergencies under dire circumstances - it just doesn't feel as real as the first half. But overall, I enjoy the book and highly recommend it.
0316069434|5.0|Michael Connelly never fails to spin a great 'yarn'.  This one is particularly good, having many twists and turns that could be unexpected.  Since I have lived thru the time period of the story, it was all the more interesting.  He never lets me down.... as a matter of fact, I have read every one of his books and am never disappointed.  My son is also a fan. I can truly recommend this book without reservations..... if you like a good mystery.

The full-size SD cards stick out a little, even though there is room enough inside the &#34;card&#34; for them--but it was apparently easier or cheaper to mold the plastic with a divider down the exact middle.  A little more thought could have resulted in flush-fitting SD cards.<br /><br />Still, it is the best memory card carrier I have used.  But still hoping for something along these lines but improved.

0553582038|3.0|I have previously read and reviewed the first three books of the now-classic fantasy series, A Song of Ice and Fire, by George R.R. Martin, for this blog: A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, and A Storm of Swords.<br /><br />A Feast for Crows is considered by some the red-headed step child of the series so far because even though it is the most critically recognized entry in the series (nominated for the Hugo, Locus and British Fantasy Society awards although notably it failed to win any of these) it is also the book in the series which is rated the lowest by actual readers. There's a definite reason for this. A Feast for Crows was first published nearly 5 years after the publication of 2000's A Storm of Swords and the expectations of Martin's burgeoning fan base were extremely high. A Feast for Crows became the first book in the series to debut as #1 on the New York Times bestseller list and be an international publishing phenomenon. This is somewhat surprising, because several of the most popular characters from the series do not make an appearance in A Feast for Crows. Martin structures his novels as series of chapters with intersecting and overlayed points-of-views from specific characters on the same series of events. Because A Feast for Crows grew so gigantic during the five years Martin spent writing it, at some point he decided to concentrate on some of the less popular (some would say more villainous) characters in A Feast for Crows and push the perspectives of the more popular characters (Arya Stark, Tyrion Lannister, Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen to name a few) into the still-to-be-written A Dance with Dragons (which despite this headstart still took an agonizing 6 years to be published).<br /><br />You'd think that the 4th entry in a series which has been decreed to be no longer than 7 books long would be concentrating on reducing the scope of the story not expanding it. If you thought that you'd be wrong, because Martin introduces several new characters who of course come with their own plots and allegiances which somehow link up to the previously revealed plots and allegiances like a slowly growing intricate spider-web or moss spreading inch by inch over a stone tomb.<br /><br />The theme of the book is about power, and of course we all know absolute power corrupts absolutely. The anti-heroine of the series, Cersei Lannister Barratheon is now fully ascendant at the seat of power in King's Landing, although due to the inherent sexism (some would say misogyny) of the culture she is not officially crowned and of course does not sit on The Iron Throne, as her husband and sons have. Cersei is the kind of character readers love to hate and Martin puts her in her place somewhat, saving the coup de grace for the next book, we hope.<br /><br />The plots are too numerous to summarize here, but suffice it to say that the conflict which has animated the first three books, the War of the Five Kings is quickly hurtling to a conclusion and this book is about what people do after the war is over, and how the \\"winners\\" and \\"losers\\" are both affected in its aftermath.<br /><br />The one good thing about Martin pushing all the story lines of the favorite characters into A Dance with Dragons is that it makes that book an even more desirable read, and one that I will try to review shortly.<br />Despite the slight lull that A Feast for Crows represents in the A Song of Ice and Fire series, it still points out how salient the stories and characters that Martin has created that even the secondary characters make for a compelling read, and promise that the next book should be even more so.<br /><br />Title: A Feast for Crows<br />Author: George R.R.

0307895475|5.0|book was received with no problems and thanks for the fast and great service and also was better than expected thanks again
0553801473|5.0|After a long wait of nearly six years since the publication of A Feast for Crows, the fifth book in George R.R. Martin's award-winning, best-selling A Song of Ice and Fire series, A Dance with Dragons was released in July 2011.<br /><br />The entire A Song of Ice and Fire series has had a higher profile lately, especially since HBO started airing a mini-series called Game of Thrones based on the first book, A Game of Thrones. Their intention is to shoot each season of the series roughly based on each book in the series. Peter Dinklage won a very important Emmy award (Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Series) for his portrayal of Tyrion Lannister, one of the fan's favorite characters.<br /><br />A Dance with Dragons was reviewed by all the major papers of record (Los Angeles Times, New York Times, Time) as well as the usual suspects of media outlets online, generally positively. Among fans, however, the reviews are somewhat mixed, with the feeling that the latest book is closer to A Feast for Crows than  A Storm of Swords. To me, that's to be expected because the timeline of events that occurred in A Feast for Crows occupy about half of the book in A Dance with Dragons, happily told from the perspective of the fan's favorite characters. The problem with this is that not much progress was made on the huge, series-spanning plots like: Daenerys' march to Westeros from Essos, John Snow's attempts to maintain the Wall against the invasion of Creatures of the Frozen North, Bran Stark's destiny to actualize his magical talents and whether the Iron Throne will be controlled by someone who actually deserves the power and cherishes the people they rule, just to name a few. (By some counts, there were around  11 central plots covered in just this book).<br /><br />On extended reflection, I think my overall evaluation of the book is closer to the official reviewer' than the fans'. I've only read A Dance with Dragons once, but I would still rank it as the second best book of the series, behind the impressive A Storm of Swords which is still the best of the bunch with A Dance with Dragons close behind, followed by A Clash of Kings and A Game of Thrones (the less said about A Feast for Crows, the better).<br /><br />I had the good fortune of only starting to read the series in 2011, so I have not had to experience the half-decade long wait for the next installment in the series. Sadly, now that I have caught up with Martin's production schedule, I will have to comfort myself during the long wait for Book 6 (widely reported to be titled The Winds of Winter) by re-reading the first five books and watching the excellent HBO television adaptations of the earlier books (apparently each season of the series will be an adaptation of the corresponding book). Hopefully the next book will be out before the television series catches up with Martin!<br /><br />Title: A Dance with Dragons.<br />Author: George R.R.

B000FBFN1U|5.0|Enjoyment has its limits and once it's met New life must emerge. This is that new life, this is simply more.
1439130833|5.0|Exactly what I was looking for. This is such a great reminder each day to remain positive! I would recommend this for everyone esp if you have watched/read the secret and agree with it :)
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book, loved it. Sad in some parts and humorous in others. I cannot wait to read the next one!
B004SBS8LA|4.0|There is a reason every single person has heard of this game except for a handful of Amish. It is easy to play, fun, and eats up time you might otherwise spend listening to boring people or going outside to breath fresh air.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|Its by far the most perfect calculator ever! I've never used anything like it. Everyone should get this calculator. Its a gift from above so take advantage of it!!! $0.99 is so worth it!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I check each day because it is so easy to use and it has an impressive appearance with lots of information.
0061353248|5.0|This helped me understand that my &#34;rational and logical&#34; approach with clients won't work that effectively if I can't see the times they will be predictably irrational.  I loved the insights gained into human behavior from Dan Ariely's experiments.  We all cheat a little.  And we won't drive 5 miles to save $10 on a $500 suit, but we will drive 5 miles to save $10 on a tank of gas.  Same $10.
B005IU1OMA|5.0|This is a great documentary about snowboarders.  The cinematography and soundtrack are great.  I like how it comes with a Bluray and DVD.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is awesome! It is my number one used game on my kindle fire and so easy to use. You can complete challenges or just play around with it. I highly recommend this!
B0058Z4NR8|5.0|The inequality in prosperity in the world is a fascinating topic.<br />Different theories exist and they all try to explain the fact that some countries are rich whereas others are poor.<br />The theory of extractive and inclusive economic and political institutions from the authors, Acemoglu and Robinson, is the most plausible one for me. It is well known that, for example, property rights and their enforcement lead generally to higher investments or that a free economy with the same economic rights leads to a growth in efficiency and innovation, but the authors show (based on the history of many countries) the reasons WHY countries are either rich or poor today. It is the interaction of different factors and institutions, economical and political, that allows each person to prosper and to improve their and their nation's prosperity. Definitely a book to read to understand the world of today!
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|We play this just to pass some time - not much to do, really. We never 'buy' coins, which is why I think they designed it, because we're always running out of them.  We only get to play for a few minutes at a time, then go on to something else, & come back later when more coins have regenerated...
0920668372|5.0|Classic childhood favorite that I was thrilled to find online for such a great price--showed it to my grandma and we remembered how much I used to love having her read it to me!
B009UNGYHG|5.0|A great protective case (with charging capabilities).  it's a nice addition and solves the only negative issue with the Voyager Legend (the strange charger), because this case uses a relatively standard USB and even works for my phone!  Very pleased with this product.
030746363X|5.0|This diet is not for the faint of heart because it's not really a diet, it's a lifestyle; however, the books is definitely worth the purchase. My best friends and I are doing this together; in the past four weeks, one has lost over 8 pounds, I've lost inches and a couple pounds, and the other is leaning out. Good buy.
B00A77II0U|4.0|It's a very great game but it's too short. The game needs to be longer. Maybe add more chapters. Otherwise great!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is fun yet difficult,it is better than the first temple run in its graphics and in what new things are in it. There is now diamonds that you can use to level up and you can get way more $ much easier and when you level up you get more chance to upgrade. This game is 100% amazing!!!!!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|What a wonderful series. Excellent actors, beautiful setting and first class writing. All of it keeps  you interested week after week!
B007TNS6JI|4.0|its a fun game to play it helps to pass time and entertain little kids. Also its an all round game for anyone who likes mythical games.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Definitely worth 3 bucks especially with the new update. THERE IS NOW SANDBOX MODE. I also got so addicted and made it to round 110. It lagged so much so I just gave up and sold everything:)
B005RDF2RG|2.0|This movie has contributed to the decline of manners in my children!!  I am disappointed and surprised with the outcome.  I now have a house of little ogres.
B0009MDPYW|5.0|an excellent movie after the first couple times. you've really got to pay attention to the nuances and hidden items in order to fully appreciate what's going on, but overall it's worth it. an excellent performance by Keanu and Tilda
B006LSZECO|2.0|I read a lot and I was disappointed that the twists and turns in this plot just got more and more mentally disturbed rather than finding any solutions or rational conclusions.  Would not recommend it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I am enthralled with this series of books Sylvia Day is the best writer of erotic romance. I love all her stuff! The dynamic soul mate connection between Gideon  and Eva is amazing. Don't we all wish we could have that kind of connection with our other half?!?  I know this Crossfire series has to end sometime but would like it to go on and on. I would recommend this book to anyone, but definitely start with the first in the series, Bared To You. You will NOT be disappointed!!!
B008M0UTRO|5.0|Again, if its from Studio Ghibli, it's beautiful, and a good story. Can't ask for more! I love Myazaki's artwork! Does the countryside still look this way?
B00AX7PGQS|2.0|\\"Holy Motors\\" is an attempt at a reflexive film about making and watching films by French director Leos Carax. Making a film about films that doesn't alienate the audience is a difficult trick to pull off. Unfortunately, \\"Holy Motors\\" is a lesson in how not to go about it. We follow Mr. Oscar (Denis Lavant) over the course of a long day, as he is driven around Paris in a limousine by an assistant named C&eacute;line (Edith Scob), from one \\"appointment\\" to the next. In each of nine appointments, Mr. Oscar, a great actor and master of disguise, takes on a different role: a hunched elderly panhandler, a character in an erotic computer-generated game decked out in a catsuit with motion-capture sensors, a middle-aged family man, a mustachioed murderer, Mr. Merde, a grotesque character taken from Carax' work in the film \\"Tokyo!\\" (2008). The list goes on.<br /><br />It seems that Oscar is an actor, working for a mysterious employer who criticizes his performance as being \\"tired\\" midway through the film. But this exercise is meaningless without context. We never see what impact Oscar's hard work and dedication to craft has on him. On the few occasions that he seems to step out of character, it is just another layer of the performance, a fiction inside of a fiction inside of a fiction. Oscar says he does it \\"for the beauty of the act\\". I would have thought he did it for the money. He complains that he can't perform well when he can't see the camera, and the cameras have become too small to see. That doesn't make him sympathetic or interesting. He's self-indulgent and whiney.<br /><br />Perhaps the story is to be found in Oscar's employer. Notwithstanding the personification of this employer in one scene, Oscar's employer is, of course, the audience. It's us. But I can't say that Oscar's histrionics had any effect on me. Not even one is the least bit engaging or intriguing. A couple of them are unbearably maudlin. So if \\"Holy Motors\\" is asking why we crave this kind of spectacle from other people, well, we don't. Watching Oscar's \\"appointments\\" would put a crackhead into a coma. This film is an hour and 50 minutes long, but the material could have been packed into a film half that length. I think Oscar's real motive for wearing himself out, physically and emotionally, putting on shows for invisible audiences, is that he doesn't know how to do anything else. I suspect that is also Leos Carax' motive. In French with optional English subtitles.om other people, well, we don't. Watching Oscar's \\"appointments\\" would put a crackhead into a coma. This film is an hour and 50 minutes long, but the material could have been packed into a film half that length. I think Oscar's real motive for wearing himself out, physically and emotionally, putting on shows for invisible audiences, is that he doesn't know how to do anything else.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Heart wrenching, angst ridden, fantastic read with glimmers of hope, love and enough jaw dropping moments to make you gasp, squeal and cause questions of your sanity among your husband and dog.<br /><br />Couldn't put it down!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this series. Just a beautiful story!  But don't get too attached to the characters, you never know what to expect.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I like how you can save and create personalized melodies for later. I also love a timer, which this one has. I just wish it had the monk gongs that I like.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love this game - play it with my young grandchildren and have a blast. They also have it on their ipads.  Great fun.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|Excellent purchase.  Happy to be able to purchase the complete series and in Blu-ray. Great for the die hard Star Trek lover.  Highly recommend.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|I started watching this on a whim. At first I didn't think I was going to like it. Needless to say I devoured all 3 seasons in no time. I was a little caught off guard with the ending of S3. This is now on my must watch list.
B006C67NP6|5.0|what a value- if you use real books/fake books- get this app.  Loaded with features. I love it. Especially the play along feature, changes keys when you want too.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|I love this album.  It is my favorite album right behind Violator.  Strong songwriting, love the industrial electronica, Martin's guitar, melodies, vocals.  A really soulful album, to me.  Dave's songwriting was a wonderful surprise.  Suffer Well,  I Want It All, and Nothing Impossible all great songs.  Suffer Well is one of my favorites on the album. Nothing's Impossible is so dark and moody and hopeful.  I Want It All is simple yet melodious and moving.<br /><br />The opening track, A Pain That I'm Used To, is absolutely amazing.  John the Revelator rocking, and Precious is one of their best songs ever. Lillian is pure pleasure.  Martin's songwriting is stellar on this album.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|We got this for our 3 yr. old granddaughter who wanted to draw and it is wonderful because we can download the drawings on facebook for her Aunt's and older sisters in other parts of the country!
B0091REZMW|5.0|I really enjoy this game.  The new graphics are great<br />I have spent no money and still have a great time
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|Talk about being caught between circumstances and his convictions!<br />This is &#34;A must see for anyone interested in getting a picture of what it must have been like for Lincoln&#34;.
B005NPCUC8|5.0|The  radio station (WCMF) got this album in Saturday 's mail  delivery. I was on air that day from3pm-7pm. I was program and music director.After opening it and listening,I decided I had to play it a side at a time. Side one started about 5p and side two about 5:40. The calls were incredible!! Especially for side 2. At about 6:10 I went back and played side 2 again, The rest they say is (and still) &#34;History&#34; The response was over the top all weekend and during the week. It's one of thise albums you remember when you first heard it!<br />Bernie Kimpal
B001XUJMZK|5.0|Talk about hard times from tyranny and suppression from their ruling English neighbors.<br /><br />This is a great story of one man and a cause, Freedom.
B004X2M3N8|5.0|Always like the beginning Dr.. Who-not so much future Dr. Who Especially the bushy haired one with the long scarf! That's why I started watching the old series.again. Love all the Female players and now you're charging for HD versions.. I am a Prime Member.
B003WUYQSW|5.0|I discovered Gary some weeks ago in a marketing article with a link to one of his speeches, saw it and was amazing, so I bought his book and I'm happy I did it. I'm in a different business but will definitely try to think how I can put together some ideas from this book.
0470477237|5.0|This book changed the way I view Social Media and Networking. I highly recommend this book.<br />Thanks Erik Qualman for writing such a great piece...
B0015AARJI|5.0|I bought it for my little brother and what can I say, he just love it. Now he plays with more friends at home.
B00BIPCXJM|5.0|Wow!  I never heard of this show until I came across it on my prime video offerings........I think it is one of the best shows on TV!  Thanks for introducing me.
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|He's a pretty busy guy with all he's got going on---but never not enough to whip up another bunch of great original songs.I really like it and I'm sure everyone else that takes a chance on purchasing it---will too.
1936594625|4.0|Classic must read and holds your interest through and through... Well written and a timeless classic... Recommend to those who are not familar with classics...
B00AH8VU0Y|5.0|Just started watching this show with my husband.  We watched all three seasons in just over a week.  Lots of missed sleep but soooo worth it!  Daryl is our favorite character.
B00BSBXA98|3.0|The actual movie was ok but the quality of the movie for being HD was horrible! I figured this was going to be a great movie for HDTV but it was not worth the extra money.
B008JFUNPK|5.0|This is a  fun family movie  .you can learn a little about being a family and working together as a team
B00499NHLC|5.0|Benedict Cumberbatch is an excellent Sherlock Holmes and I love his Watson! Martin Freeman is tops. I know the purists won't like that this version is set in today's times, but I really like it. It's very well done. The two actors do a fine job of keeping the spirit of the characters created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. I'm not sure about Moriarity yet, though. One note: While you can watch each episode individually, it's best if you watch the shows in order. There are all kinds of neat touches to events in earlier shows. I started watching in the middle of the second season when it was on PBS, and saw the first season through Amazon Prime (love that prime!). The first show is a fascinating account of how the two first met in our modern world. Very interesting.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this is such a good game for people who want to have their own horse! a lot of thongs are worth diamonds bug other than that its awesome.
B004SBQGHS|1.0|loved this game but an update causes the paid ad free version to have ads - should be cause for rejection by Amazon when the developer modifies the paid version to remove the one thing you paid for :(
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|Great movie -- very watchable.  Our 6 year olds had no problem with the movie.  Our 4 year old needed to understand that it was just a movie and that the Easter Bunny will be fine.  We watched this movie the weekend before Easter.
B0050DZN4K|2.0|Feedly is a bit too fancy. I don't need \\"cards\\" or an app that is \\"smart\\" enough to filter my feeds. I just want a simple index of posts from sites I follow. If I've read it already, I still want it in the list. The app should not attract attention to itself, just allow me to see the content I want.
B000N2HBSO|4.0|Goodwin writes a compelling story and in many ways is able to weave the plot together as if writing a novel.  Her ability to capture the political astuteness of Lincoln and compare it to the strengths and weaknesses of his rivals makes for a compelling read.  I would definitely recommend!
B009XY97VC|5.0|I have to admit...when I listened to SkyWorld for the first time I didn't feel like it had the same epic appeal as their other two albums-Invincible and Archangel. But after listening to it a second time I fell in love! SkyWorld is quickly becoming my favorite Two Steps From Hell album. There are only a few songs I really don't care for, but other than that I listen to this album 3-4 times a day.<br /><br />SkyWorld does have a different style from the other two STFH albums, which I feel may make it hard for some fans to adjust to. I suggest giving it a chance as in my opinion it's still a huge winner! Can't wait to see  what they come up with next.
B0006GVJEE|1.0|I ordered the DVD in Nov 2012. But did not have a chance to test it until yesterday (Mar 31, 2012). And the disc 1 did not have any audio! Only images. I thought it was my computer's dvd player issue. So I switched it to a dvd player. Still did not work!<br /><br />I checked the version, it is 1, for US and Canada. So the version is correct. This is purely the problem from the disc.<br /><br />The disc 2 with interviews from Jean Reno and Natalie Portman works fine.<br /><br />I am very disappointed and trying to return it. But per the returning policy I need to pay for the shipping. With all the hassle and costs. I just don't bother.<br /><br />I will not consider purchasing any product from this seller again.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Played this game on my Kindle Fire and it worked great!<br /><br />Although it didn't take long for me to get through all the levels, Around the World is a fun game with a nice story. I enjoyed seeing all the items and the little blurb about them at the end of each level. Getting the power-ups was the most fun of the game!  I always loved hitting the power-up button and watching gems disappear!<br /><br />The harder level were a bit of a challenge, but in a fun way.  Sometimes games can be too much of a challenge or not enough of a challenge.  Around the World was a nice balance for me.<br /><br />I recommend it to anyone looking for a little fun.
B005CRY2O6|2.0|I am sure many of these recipes are delicious, but getting to the point where you can actually make them would be difficult. The ingredients are less than everyday fair. I don't know many people who have quail eggs stocked as a kitchen staple. Overall I feel it's more complicated than it needs to be.
B003MOHX8S|5.0|Music is my life, and my life wasn't complete until my siblings shared Two Steps From Hell's music with me. Inspiring and motivational music this album captured me right away and makes me always ready to face each new day! Great purchase and worth every penny.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I just got minecraft for the Pc and I think it is awesome.  This version is a little limmeted but 6.0 isn't.  If you don't know how to update you're minecraft po met eddition well here's your answer.  After you have already downloaded the app through the amazon appstore you have to bascicly buy it again but the good part is it's free! So what you do is go into the appstore find minecraft pocket eddition and tap on it then you tap buy app now you do that and it should bring you to this screen and she. There is an update the little orange box underneath the minecraft logo will say &quot;update&quot; you tap that and it will update but if there's not an update it will just say &quot;open&quot; and if you tap on that it will just bring to the minecraft pocket eddition home page.
0553841092|5.0|I really cared about all the characters in this book;  they were multi-leved and interesting.  I stayed up all night reading because I so wanted these people to have good things happen to them. I was satified with the ending since the author portrayed people whose lives concerned me and made the ending  a non-obvious but logical conclusion.
B000007ODX|5.0|We have two kids and they both have listened to this album since they were born.  We play it during nap time and our now our son, who is almost four, requests it if we forget.  Got this one for a friend who just had their first little one!
B00466HN72|5.0|The movie is awesome. My kids watched it almost every night the week before Easter. I got it very quickly in the mail too.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|if you are reading this review get the app right now! I love this game! The reason I wrote this reason wrote this reviw is I think you will love it.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|No issues with slow downloads or other problems with downloading. Very happy with this app!! Very easy to use!! Very wide selection to watch!!
B007SGM084|5.0|Maybe a little too much sex but overall I was happily drowned in there story,couldn't get enough of it. Would happily reread it.!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is super easy to play and it gives you the option to get a random deal or a winning deal; I always take the winning deal because DUH! who doesn't want to win! highly recommended
B00BESJYAY|4.0|Good story, good life lessons, interesting and entertaining. Not the greatest movie I ever saw, but I would definitely recommend it as a good movie to watch with kids ages 10 and up.
0778328821|5.0|love the mix of real life. enjoy the way its writen suggest any one read the series but in order
B003O86FMW|5.0|The Hunger Games is a great trilogy.  You find yourself staying up late to try and find out what happens next.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|really fun I like feeding the horse graphics are pretty cool freezes sometimes but not that bad I will play it a lot don't like that it looks hard to earn a lot of coins
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I am sincerely hoping that Mr. Martin continues writing this series.  I love how he keeps changing characters in the books and killing people you don't expect.  Great twists in the writing.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Beautifully filmed and performed. I am as addicted as I was to Upstairs Downstairs, which is channeling through the Abbey, yes?

B005LAIGP0|4.0|I picked up this DVD on a whim and watched it late at night...which turned out to be a mistake.  Normally, scary movies don't bother me, but this one actually spooked me a bit.  It can be slow at times, but I think the slow pace actually lets the creepiness of the scenes get inside you.<br /><br />A lawyer is sent off to a run-down house on the edge of a marsh in order to go through the papers left there, leaving his young son at home.  This is his last shot at working out at the firm, due to his clear depression over the death of his wife in childbirth years ago.  Once he gets there, the townsfolk try desperately to send him right back to London and warn him not to go out to Eel Marsh House.  But, of course, he does...<br /><br />The Woman in Black turns out to be a ghost with murderous tendencies and Daniel Radcliffe's character tries desperately to deal with fulfilling his charge as well as figuring out why she is haunting the place, and attacking the children of the village.  It was hard at first to see past \\"Harry Potter,\\" but as the movie continued, the acting won me over.<br /><br />The house itself, filled with Victorian oddities and old paintings, and the lonely marsh its set in provide a spooky landscape for the story.  When the tides roll in, the place is cut off entirely from the mainland and this makes the setting even more frightening.  Its very Gothic, but with enough touches of modern horror to engage a modern audience.<br /><br />I'll definitely be watching it again, but not late at night, this time.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|I wasn't expecting Jeremy to grab my attention the way that Matt did, but he does an awesome job of acting in this movie.  I highly recommend watching the third movie before this one, just to make sure you're familiar with the story line.  I LOVE this series.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|The simple premise of this game makes it easy to pick up...and hard to put down.  There is virtually no instruction needed and it works as advertised.<br /><br />It would be nice to be able to record the top 10 times (or at least more than only the top time) but other than that, nothing comes to mind to improve it.
B004LSJCJM|5.0|One of my favorite albums for this fantastic artist.  There isn't a single song on this CD that I did not love.
B003YL4KS0|2.0|This is not a review of the book itself but of the Kindle version. I chose to buy it in the Kindle format because it offered video and audio files for a more \\"complete\\" reading experience but I did not see the little box on the side that states that the audio and video are only available for iPads, iPhones, and other i-devices. I should have seen it, true, but it is also not very prominent so watch out! If you are looking to buy the Kindle version for the videos make sure you have an i-device.

0321344758|1.0|It makes me cringe to read the book and see examples of websites from 10 years ago.  The book keep using Amazon's ORIGINAL website as example but Amazon website has changed so much that it contradicts most of the points the book is making.  The author is obviously out of touch with latest trends and ideas.  For a 2nd edition, I was hoping he will at least take the time to update his examples.  But instead, this 2nd edition was merely pushed out to make more money for the author and publisher.  It's really a shame.  I bought the book based on so many reviews and my company was going to buy one for all our developers.  I am glad I read it first.  I hope this review helps other avoid this \\"tourist trap\\".

Colin Campbell presents both the Science and the Politics of the Standard American Diet (S.A.D.) in an easy to comprehend manner and reveals many long known but poorly disseminated truths about the ramifications of a Western Diet.  Again, a powerful presentation which should be required reading for everyone.  (You won't see or hear this material in the Main-Stream-Media.)

B0039SFKSW|4.0|Another strong album by the original line up of ASIA, however, don't look for the 80's sound to be here.  There are some similarities in sound, as John Wetton's lead vocals never seem to change and sound as strong as ever.  There are some tracks on here I am fond of, like Holy War and Don't Wanna Lose you Now, but overall in my opinion, this album is not as strong as \\"Phoenix\\".  I picked up this album because it again features the original line up of ASIA and wasn't pleased with what I have heard of the non-original line up albums. I wouldn't call this a \\"must buy\\" unless you are a die hard fan, but it does have some good tracks. If you want to hear a more modern, less musically dramatic Asia, you might want to check this album out.  I had to let it grow on me and learn not to compare it to the past or you will be disappointed.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|i gave it 5 stars because it is free, intresting, and more enjoyable than the other hungry shark games. an easy, quick spur -of -the -moment game that can also keep you occupied for hours. good for any age but there are some graphics of blood. hope this helped
B00154GEFU|5.0|It's hard to change expectations of a group you grew up on and loved and to listen to something put out more than 20 years after their star burned bright, but this album struck a chord for me.  It took a while to get their 80's hits like The Smile Has left your Eyes, Only Time will Tell, and Don't Cry out of my head and trying to give this album a listen from a totally new perspective.  I was at first disappointed that it didn't meet the standards of their mega-hits of years ago, but the album soon grew on me.  It starts of strong with \\"Never Again\\" drawing you in and let's you down softly at the end with \\"An Extraordinary Life\\".  While I don't think these songs would be classified as power ballads, I am reminded of the power ballads of the 80's and best describe some of the music on this album as an Asia twist on power ballads.  While strong music when judged on it's own, don't compare it to the Asia of the 80's as there is no comparison.  If you liked the Asia of the 80's I think you might like this album, but it will take time to grow on you.

0545123267|4.0|Thank goodness for a power outage! Without it, this book would still be sitting on my shelf waiting to be finished (don't worry- it had many friends there). Shiver, by Maggie Stiefvater, is just the thing you need to get you over those Twilight cravings. It is full of star-crossed romance, mystical creatures, and a story you cannot get enough of. While it is indeed a book about a pack of werewolves, Shiver is nothing like Jacob and the Twilight pack.<br /><br />The Shiver wolves do shift between man (or woman) and wolf, but they turn into actual wolves- not the creepy man/wolf combination. The wolves cannot shift at will, but are actually at the mercy of the weather. When it gets cold, they turn into wolves for the winter. In the summer they stay in their human forms. The catch is that the longer they have been werewolves, the shorter the time they will stay human until they become permanent wolves. This final change is what Grace and Sam are dreading.<br /><br />Sam is a wolf nearing the end of his human years. Grace is a girl in high school who was attacked and bitten by the wolves when she was young. The only thing that saved her was Sam. He stopped the wolves, but knew she had been bitten and would turn. Even though she didn't actually turn, Sam waited for her each and every year- in the winter as a wolf outside her house and in the summer as a boy in town. When a local boy is attacked by the wolves and mysteriously disappears from the morgue, the townspeople decide to take care of the wolf pack once and for all with a hunting party. Grace is terrified for her wolf (who she doesn't know is Sam) and races into the woods to stop it. After she finally succeeds in halting the hunters, they send her back to her house where she finds Sam on her porch, naked, shot, and with the same haunting eyes of her wolf- the wolf who saved her all those years earlier.<br /><br />This starts a romance that must race against time. With winter fast-approaching, Sam and Grace try everything to keep Sam human, but it can't last forever. This is Sam's last year as a person and he does not want to lose Grace now that he finally has her. With rogue wolves, erratic and angry new wolves, and her friends and family in danger, Grace fights a long autumn.<br /><br />This book is a fantastic new take on the werewolf sensation. You find yourself drawn to the wolves and their \\"family\\" while still wishing Sam could just stay human for Grace. With enough action to please the masses and enough sweet, devoted romance to make the ladies swoon, this is a great book!ything to keep Sam human, but it can't last forever.

B00005JKQZ|5.0|As a nursing student, my class was asked to watch this movie all together.  We used it to discuss mental health, schizophrenia, etc.  Now that I am a nursing instructor myself... I bought this movie to show to my current class who was studying mental health issues.  Great teaching tool.  Highly recommend it to any nursing instructor looking to enhance the teaching/learning.
0525421033|5.0|If I Stay, by Gayle Forman has a beautiful cover and a beautifully haunting story to tell you. I read this book in one sitting this summer because it was so haunting, and was reminded of it when I saw a student reading it in study hall one night. In one of those moments we teachers of dyslexic children live for, I found myself talking with her about the book with a passion and an urgency that instantly transported me to the day I couldn't put this book down.<br /><br />In the first few pages, the story begins with a horrific car accident. Mia wakes up on the side of the road in the middle of the carnage. She sees the bodies of her parents and then her own. Mia is still alive after the accident, but just barely. She is transported to the hospital where her body is fighting between life and death and her mind still isn't sure.<br /><br />Mia's family, friends, and boyfriend come by one by one and share their love for her, but without her parents, is there anything to return for? Mia must make the ultimate choice that none of us can imagine making- whether it is worth fighting to stay alive or easier to just relax into a peaceful end.<br /><br />This book is beautiful and terribly sad right from the beginning. Hearing the words her family says to Mia's stoic face reminds me of my own family- loving and devoted beyond the average definitions of such words. You can feel how much they love her and still understand how easy it would be for her to just let go and not face the pain of what has happened to her parents. If I Stay is a relatively short read, but one that will stay with you long after you have turned the last page.
B003ELOQD4|5.0|I am a huge U2 fan, and I have to say that this show was absolutely incredible! The 360 tour was amazing and this blu-ray movie of the Rose Bowl show was extremely well done. The audio and video quality was great, I really felt like I was there at the concert. The bonus features were also pretty cool. The bonus features include documentaries about the tour and music videos from the No Line CD, a bonus track (Breathe), clips from the 360 tour, videos from the opening of the European tour and the North American tour, and more. Overall this movie is incredible and provides a breathtaking concert experience. In my opinion, this is one of U2's best concerts on film.

B00ABGEFWC|3.0|THis game is cute and all but it doesn't have enough content to make you want to continue playing it. You aren't even allowed to place bldgs where you want and it just gets boring after a while.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|It is an okay game. However, it did not hold my interest and I thought some of the games were lame.
B004HD61KE|5.0|Once I discover an author I try to read everything they write.  And this has been true with Rollin's Sigma Force series.  In every book in the series Rollins touches upon some lesser known arcane scientific or historical fact.  In this book he goes into great depth about the relationship of the native Americans and some of the founding fathers; the mystery surrounding the design of the Great Seal and the pale or light skinned Indians that have been discovered here (ie, Kennesaw man) and their possible link with Mormonism.  And in every book Rollins provides a chapter with more information regarding these things that you can read up on further if you desire.<br /><br />The characters he presents to us are intriguing and he lets us delve a bit into their heads and personal lives.  Also, unlike other authors he doesn't mind getting the boss out in he field or killing off or permanently maiming some of the lead characters.  Unlike other books where you know the hero is going to escape the worse situation you never know til the end which of Rollin's characters will make it.

B005LW5J9O|1.0|This book argues persuasively that an atheistic epic poem written in the first century BCE helped create what the author calls \\"modernity.\\" It was one of Thomas Jefferson's favorite books, which explains why he included the Epicurean phrase \\"the pursuit of Happiness\\" in the Declaration of Independence. Another example is Niccolo Machiavelli, who made his own copy of the book in the 15th century. Machiavelli was the first to say princes and kings could violate moral laws for reasons of state. It is said that the Devil got its nickname (\\"Old Nick\\") from Machiavelli.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the book is also a diatribe against Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism because Greenblatt considers \\"modernity\\" to be a good development in the history of mankind. Greenblatt agrees with poem's thesis that the universe is composed of atoms, that there is no life after death, and that our purpose in life should be to pursue happiness.<br /><br />Being rational means exercising good judgment when marshaling evidence and deciding whether a theory or insight is true or just probable. Intelligence usually refers to how fast or how slow it takes someone to understand a theory or insight, but people have blind spots about religion and cannot even grasp certain ideas. This is because religion causes conflict, conflict causes anxiety, and inhibition is a defense mechanism for anxiety. People are inhibited from thinking intelligently and rationally about religion.<br /><br />I would give Greenblatt a very low score on following test of intelligence and rationality. There are four answers to each question, and the test includes listing the answers from the least rational to the most rational:<br />Question 1. What is the relationship between my self and my body?<br />Question 2.  What caused the universe to begin 13 billion years ago?<br />Question 3. What should our goal in life be?<br /><br />The four solutions to the mind-body problem are 1) dualism, 2) materialism, 3) idealism, and 4) the metaphysical answer. Dualism is the theory that spiritual substances exist. Materialism is the theory that only the body exists and the mind is some kind of illusion or epiphenomena. There is more evidence for materialism than dualism because material substances, unlike spiritual substances, do indeed exist. Idealism is the theory that God gives us the illusion of having bodies so that we can communicate with each other. There is more evidence for idealism than materialism and dualism because we can imagine that our bodies are illusions, but we can't imagine that we don't exist. The metaphysical answer is that the mind-body problem is a mystery and that humans are embodied spirits.<br /><br />The four answers to the question of what caused the Big Bang are: 1) God did it. 2) An angel did it. 3) The universe is not intelligible. 4) The scientific method will eventually produce an answer. There is no evidence that God caused the universe to begin, other than quotes from the Bible. There is more evidence that an angel did it because an angel would have a motive for doing such a thing. The theory that the universe is not intelligible arises from the observation that animals don't ask questions. Just because a human being asks a question, does not mean there is an answer. No. 4 is the answer judged to be true by many rational people.<br /> <br />The four answers to the question of our purpose in life are: 1) Humans should increase pleasure and decrease suffering. 2) Humans should try for fulfill their potentials. 3) Human life has no meaning or purpose. 4) Humans should serve God in this world in the hope of being with Him in the next. No. 1 conflicts with the great mystery that people who devote themselves to their own happiness tend to be unhappy, and people who devote themselves to the happiness of others tend to be happy. No. 2 ignores the fact that humans can fulfill their potential in different ways. The problem of life consists precisely of deciding how to fulfill our potentials. Saying we should fulfill our potentials or achieve self-realization has no truth content or value at all. No. 3 and No. 4 are the only two answers supported by evidence.<br /><br />I give myself a score of 100 points: 6 points for each of the 12 answers, 12 points for understanding the mind-body problem, and 16 points for putting the answers in the right order. I estimate Greenblatt's score at only 18 points. He gets no credit for his ideas about the origin of the universe because he doesn't know the difference between God and an angel.  He gets no credit for the meaning of life because he assumes there is no evidence for life after death. He only gets points for understanding materialism, dualism, and idealism. He may deserve points for understanding human beings have souls even though he doesn't understand that the human soul is spiritual. Most atheists think the human soul is spiritual by definition and that humans do not have souls. Body (matter) and soul (form) are the metaphysical concepts that explain why humans are equal to each other, but at the same time different from each other.<br /><br />Greenblatt doesn't realize that not having a meaningful life makes people prone to irrational beliefs. People who don't believe in God believe in anything, it has been said. Examples of irrational beliefs by the likes of Jefferson and Machiavelli are laissez faire capitalism, socialism, nationalism, anti-Semitism, imperialism, and eugenics. These are the beliefs that gave us what Greenblatt calls \\"modernity.\\" In my opinion, what these beliefs gave us is the atrocities of the French Revolution, the Napoleonic Wars, the Franco-Prussian War, the American Civil War, the First and Second World Wars, and Nazi and Communist genocide.<br /><br />A number of times, Greenblatt implies that the Catholic Church was against science. He cited the disagreement with Galileo about the heliocentric model in the 17th century, which was invented in the 16th century. In my opinion, the Catholic Church exercised better scientific judgment than Galileo. If the Earth moved around the Sun, the position of the stars would not be fixed. It was only a century later that improvements in telescopes enabled astronomers to observe the motion of stars as our planet revolved around the sun.<br /><br />It can be argued that modern science began in the 13th century when the Bishop of Paris, acting upon the advise of scientists at the University of Paris, condemned certain propositions by Aristotle because they implied that God was not omnipotent. Faith in God and the belief or hope that the universe is intelligible is what gave mankind ongoing and sustainable scientific achievements. The scientific achievements of the Greek civilization were isolated. Science in all other civilizations was virtually nonexistent because of belief in pantheism and eternal cycles, instead of belief in the immutable and infinite being Christians, Jews, and Muslims call God.eciding how to fulfill our potentials.

I often hate it, dread it, and then feel guilty about hating it and dreading it.  For that reason, reading this trenchant defense of introversion was nothing less than a healing experience for me.  But it should also be read by anyone in a management, teaching, or other leadership position in which they probably tend to demand extroversion and devalue introversion, as examined in great detail by the author.  Thank you Ms. Cain!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Best book ever! Have to read I loved it and so will you! It's amazing read this book right now!
B00992CF6W|3.0|It passes the time, but it doesn't feel like minecraft. Most of the fun in minecraft is creating your OWN tools and memorizing the recipes. Also, you can't even explore caves and finding minerals and things is a pain! Until they add some things the pocket edition isn't going to be anywhere near as fun as on a PC...
1935251740|4.0|I don't know enough about the physical sciences to know if the author is totally full of baloney when it comes to physics - but even if he is, I found his book really thought-provoking, and weirdly validating for my own view of the universe. As someone raised in Christian Science, Lanza's ideas about consciousness being all, and what we experience being tied in with our thoughts - the idea that our perception determines our reality - is not a new one to me. But there were physics experiments he talks about that ARE new to me, and I found them fascinating. Lanza's analogies and language make it easy for even someone like me (a History major)to understand the ideas he's trying to convey.<br /><br />I was close to giving this book five stars - the only thing that kept me from giving it five stars was Lanza's assertion that the use of \\"consciousness\\" as an explanation for reality is a new one - never before considered in the sciences or religion - a concept for which he seems to consider himself one of the originators. Of western religions - Christianity, Judaism, Islam - Lanza writes: \\"No mention is made of other states of consciousness, nor of consciousness itself... except in mystical sects...\\" Ahem. Well. Yeah. This is simply not true. In her textbook, [[ASIN:0879520388 Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures (Authorized, Trade Ed.)]] (published in 1875 - long before Lanza arrived on Earth), for Christian Science - a denomination that is considered \\"Christian\\" by its adherents, and which they do not consider in the least \\"mystical,\\" Mary Baker Eddy mentions \\"consciousness\\" 80 times.<br /><br />But I suppose we can make a distinction between the consciousness Lanza is attempting to explain in his book, and the consciousness Eddy refers to in hers. Lanza talks about the structure of the brain, and a physical universe. Eddy speaks of a spiritual consciousness - the consciousness of Mind, God - and provides a practical use for drawing our thoughts near to that consciousness: \\"When we realize that Life is spirit, never in nor of matter, this understanding will expand into self-completeness, finding all in God, good, and needing no other consciousness.\\"<br /><br />Foreseeing the future, Eddy wrote in 1875: \\"The mariner will have dominion over the atmosphere and the great deep, over the fish of the sea and the fowls of the air. The astronomer will no longer look up to the stars, - he will look out from them upon the universe; and the florist will find his flower before its seed. Thus matter will finally be proved nothing more than a mortal belief, wholly inadequate to affect a man through its supposed organic action or supposed existence. Error will be no longer used in stating truth. The problem of nothingness, or `dust to dust,' will be solved, and mortal mind will be without form and void, for mortality will cease when man beholds himself God's reflection, even as man sees his reflection in a glass.\\"<br /><br />Karen Molenaar Terrell, author of *Blessings: Adventures of a Madcap Christian Scientist* and *The Madcap Christian Scientist's Middle Book*sciousness: \\"When we realize that Life is spirit, never in nor of matter, this understanding will expand into self-completeness, finding all in God, good, and needing no other consciousness.\\"<br /><br />Foreseeing the future, Eddy wrote in 1875: \\"The mariner will have dominion over the atmosphere and the great deep, over the fish of the sea and the fowls of the air.

B00499NHLC|5.0|This series was recommended by a friend and after viewing the first episode, I was saddened to learn that there are only 6 episodes so far... The characters are fun and the dialog is quick...plan on some &#34;rewinding&#34; to hear the excellent wordplay.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|This novel is one of those fantasy books of which the first word I think of to describe it is 'subtle'. No dramatic leaps and swordplay, but a tangible heart. A recommended read.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Read this book on the recommendation of a librarian friend and am immensely glad I did. It takes you on a journey like very few books do, and will leave you thinking at the end. (thinking a great deal too!) Loved it and will come back to read it again, I am certain!

B0094K1WZE|5.0|I am a fan of the previous Mission Impossible movies.  Each of the previous movies were very good.  MI: Ghost Protocol was very exciting and had me on the edge of my seat even though I saw it in the theatre when it was first released.  I would highly recommend this movie.

0061148512|3.0|Part autobiographical, this novel follows the life and madness of Esther Greenwood.  A smart and attractive woman, she finds herself questioning her abilities and talents.  After a failed suicide attempt, Esther is taken to a hospital, where she undergoes shock therapy treatments.<br /><br />I'm not sure how I feel about this book.  It was beautifully written, but I had a hard time connecting with Esther.  She just didn't seem real, rather she came across as a dream, as a wisp of a person.
B007THA4FI|3.0|J. K. Rowling does a fantastic job of developing the characters in &#34;The Casual Vacancy.&#34;  But, I'm 60% through the book, and I'm still waiting for something to happen.  I can't imagine that anyone would want to make this book into a movie.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I loved this movie in the theaters, saw it on a trans-Atlantic flight, and realized I'd like to see it over and over. Judi Dench and Maggie Smith are classic, incredible actresses, and the rest of the cast is supurbe as well. Fun to be had, over and over.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Keep in mind this review is coming from a typical movie person and not a Star Wars junkie.  I really liked all the movies and I thought the movies played great on the Blu Ray player. I thought the sound was great.  I'm not too picky when it comes to those things and I also have not seen all the original movies in the theatre.  I was a little hesitant to buy it at first reading some of the hard core Star War Movie Reviewer's long reviews. For an average person, I think this product is great and worth the money.  My 6 year old son just got into Star Wars and he wanted to watch all the movies.  So, this package was perfect for us.

B00BN2NQFU|5.0|THIS IS REVIEW FOR AMAZON INSTANT VIDEO VERSION OF THIS VIDEO:<br /><br />Before I downloaded the Cirque Du Soelil Worlds Away from Amazon Instant Videos, I had already seen the DVD video of Cirque Du Soleil with a friend who rented it. We watched it on a 60\\" TV screen and I totally loved the video (enough to want to own the video). And sadly, it was a just a one day rental. So after viewing this video on a large screen, I \\"tried out\\" the trailer here on Amazon to see how it would view and sound on my Samsung Tab 2 10.1 Tablet. I was totally blown away!!!! So I downloaded the full video and have watched it OVER and OVER again.<br />What I love about movies/videos on Amazon Video, keep your place so you can go right back to the movie/video later and just resume your viewing. What is so great also is the PICTURE QUALITY IS SUPERB and SOUND SUPERB!<br />Yes, I do agree with previous viewers: That this is a mixture of previous Cirque Du Soleil shows. However, in my opinion, it has some of the greatest scenes from several of the shows and they work it into the very simple storyline: Girl sees young man performing (The Aerialist), then falls in love and wants to meet him, this is how the story begins, yet I felt like it took me \\"Worlds Away\\" in the outstanding footage that lead to the exciting finale. The finale is where the girl and the Aerialist fianly get together and perform together. This part I have played over and over and over as it is so beautiful. The price I paid for this video is so worth it and yes, it plays perfectly in FULL SCREEN on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1. Love this video and I recommend it to ALL!<br />Also, thank you for reading this review, I hope it has been of help to you.
B004WGIXX4|5.0|If you like chick flicks, fairy tales, and other completely unrealistic stuff, this is your film. I laughed all the way through it and thoroughly enjoyed it beginning to end. I'm kind of a girl like that.
B005723JSQ|5.0|This is a true modern day romance. I loved every page. And I didn't want the book to end. I've told all my girlfriends to read this book.
B00051E906|4.0|No audible output is very disappointing.  Unite display is great, functionality is great. I have to add 7 words so here they are.
1476733953|5.0|Hugh Howey has a rare talent for storytelling.  You need to buy this book, you will not regret it!  I picked it up following Amazon's recommendations, and now I can't wait to receive my copy of the recently published prequel (The Shift).
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Great acting by DW and a wonderful message about getting hooked on alcohol.  As a former pilot, I was impressed with the technical aspects of the story.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|This movie was one of the most boring movies ever made. Do not waste the time to watch this movie.
B0083SBMBM|1.0|I choose 1 star because the disc was scratched. I disliked it because when I watch the movie it kept skipping in random places or freezing. I wouldn't recommend this product because if they buy it it also may be scratched as well.
B007XHWROK|5.0|I bought this cd for my daughter. She loves Justin Bieber. She plays the cd all day every day. Amazon has the best prices for music and the bonus free mp3 download is a nice gift for me the buyer.

B003VPWXRO|5.0|It has been very difficult for me to understand those people who starve themselves almost to the death and why can't they stop it. As a healthy person it is difficult to accept this kind of torture and why these people make themselves consciously sick. This book has helped me to know why they are doing this and a bit to understand why it is so difficult to stop the degeneration of the body and first of all the mind.<br />I would suggest this book to all the parents and already when your children are very small. Better avoid the situation because it is really difficult to turn the course of events when it has started.
B007HC3LHS|3.0|I was having a hard time dealing with the back and forth with the timelines/chapters, so I read them chronologically.  I think it made the story seem a little less choppy.<br /><br />There are a lot of reviews out there that say there was too much written about Cathy's OCD and PTSD issues.  I agree, there were many pages devoted to those issues.  However, many hours of Cathy's life were devoted to those issues - the checking, the double-checking, the triple-checking.  While the author may not have intended it this way, I feel it gives the reader a very good insight into Cathy's mindset and the amount of time Cathy spent on the checking.  Being a checker myself (not to Cathy's extreme though), I completely understand about the patterns and timings and not getting it just right and starting over.<br /><br />The following could be considered SPOILER information...<br /><br />There were a couple of things I could never put my finger on....First of all, Stuart???  Why did he fall for her?  It seemed to me that he saw her as a project to fix, not a romantic interest.  Second, how was she found after Lee left her for dead?  Where did Wendy come from and why did Wendy (or any other neighbor for that matter) not show up when the screaming started days and/or weeks earlier?  Third, why did all of her friends turn on her?  I could see Lee being able to convince one or two, but all of them?<br /><br />Now let me vent about Sylvia...REALLY, Cathy????  Why would you even consider having lunch with Sylvia? This is the woman that was sleeping with your boyfriend, that turned on you when you needed her the most, that lied to the court about your mental state and that told a newly released Lee where you worked...The entire ending with Sylvia left me feeling really frustrated and wanting to shake Cathy....
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|certainly loved the music and people who played in this great show. it was brought to the screen with gentleness that our inner selves have. it was outstanding.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Having the app to your tablet is a plus. Quick access from your tablet wherever you go.  It is very good app.  I recommend this to everyone.

B0028MBKVG|4.0|Loved the information and history about running but the story was too long and unnecessary.  Th evolution of man theory is fascinating.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Great show moderate language great action, not a family with young kids kind of show though. Yes I would suggest it to others.
B007H1HQW0|5.0|I purchased this in August to create drinking glasses from wine bottles, and it works exactly as described if used correctly. It's a bit tricky to master but with practice it is a really cool tool. I liked using it so much I decided to make 140 glasses for my upcoming wedding in October! The project is still in the works but without this tool I would never be able to make such a cool useful wedding favor. Thanks g2!
B005WUHAX8|1.0|it was a fake case. i dropped it a few times and every single time a piece of the case would crack off. there was a scratch on the front, the plastic part of the glass is gridded and wavy and very hard to text on. its cheaply made i couldnt turn my phone on loud and silent. it was a piece of crap.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Anyone who has dogs or loves dogs should read this book.  If I could give it more than five stars I would.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|It is action packed, It will get you wondering what is next. It is the best book I have ever read. It is even better then the \\"Harry Potter series\\" if you ask me. I would suggest that ever person that is willing to read this should.
B000LTAY1U|2.0|nice looking automatic watch, not japan made though its made in Malaysia at not made in china will buy more of different color.<br /><br />update: glass scratch so easily can't even remember how i got those scratches, wish they put a little scratch resistant glass on this beautiful watch.

1616550414|5.0|If there is something bad about this book, that would be the fact that its info won't be update when new Zelda games are released.<br /><br />Apart from that, everything felt so perfect, all the information contained in this book and the amount of artworks it bears. I can't simply express in words how happy I felt when it got delivered.<br /><br />As a fan of this series, it was wonderful to learn more about how each game was made and how they fit together to form a complex story, especially when the developer never meant to put themselves one timeline to fit all the game together in the first place.<br /><br />To end majestically, the book's last pages contain a manga-like story that precedes Skyward Sword itself.<br /><br />Couldn't ask for more.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Absolutely love this game but they make it to where you have purchase things to progress in the levels. Need to make it more fair. You would have five stars from everyone
B00BSBVLF8|3.0|I love Cirque Du Soleil so naturally I thought this would be a great movie.  Not so, at least not all of it.  Most of it, well, there is only one word to describe it...chaos...total chaos.  Half the time you can't see what is going on because so much is going on.  But I will say one thing.  I could watch the last ten minutes over and over and over.  The man and woman doing all the aerial work on the two ropes...AMAZING !!!!  These last ten minutes is what I expect from Cirque Du Soleil...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I absolutley love this game! I can play for hours and hours and never get tired of it! This game is definatley worth downloading!

0345525558|4.0|(3.5 stars) Victoria has recently aged out of the foster care system and is in a halfway house until she cannot pay the rent, and moves out to live in a public park. She has had a rough time in foster care, as we see in flashback, and was devastated when her one last shot at adoption fell through as a younger child. The one thing she has carried through from that experience is her love of plants and the language of flowers as conceived by the Victorians. She manages to get a job in a florist's shop and slowly begins to build connections and a life, and even to her past. When an unexpected event throws her into a tailspin, she retreats into herself, falling into old patterns and losing her trust for those who care about her, until after reaching a bottom she begins to see the other side. This was a stark and gritty portrayal of the traumas and pitfalls of the foster care system and its failure to gracefully transition people out to the \\"real world\\". While I appreciated the story-line, her regression and the precipitating events felt a bit jarring to me.

B00BI5IXL4|4.0|Les Miserables takes good advantage of cinematography to relay the genuineness of my favorite musical. I find the casting of Jackman and Crowe regrettable concession to the box office potential. With the cast's limited vocal range, I suspect the vocal coaches had sleepless nights during filming trying to figure out how to not bomb. Congrats to those vocal coaches. The cast does not bomb and almost does well.

1400069742|5.0|Although many books consider the history of the United States' entry into WW II, relatively few works focus on the tense, divisive history that proceeded Pearl Harbor. Philip Roth's \\"The Plot Against America\\" offers an imaginative novelist's look at this period which pales against this factual thoughtful, new history, \\"Those Angry Days: Roosevelt, Lindbergh, and America's Fight over World War II, 1939 -- 1941\\" by Lynne Olson.  The book takes its title from a quotation from Arthur Schleisinger, Jr.: \\"though historians have dealt with the policy issues, justice has not been done to the soaring personal impact of those angry days.\\"<br /><br />The book captures the tumultuous early years of WW II after the Nazis overran Europe and appeared poised to invade Great Britain. Americans fought and argued passionately about whether and how to become involved. A large isolationist group that crossed party lines believed the United States should not become involved and that staying neutral in the conflict would spare the lives of Americans. The interventionists, their opponents, advocated a variety of approaches from providing assistance to Great Britain in its struggle to becoming a belligerent in the war.<br /><br />Olson's book focuses on the respective roles of Charles Lindbergh and President Franklin Roosevelt. She finds the two alike in many ways as \\"strong-willed stubborn men who believed deeply in their own superiority and had a sense of being endowed with a special purpose.\\" Lindberg, an aviation hero and a reserved loner, had spent three years in Britain and Germany and became convinced that Britain could not match its enemy's military might and should negotiate a peace.  He became the most famous spokesman for isolationism, but he tended to go his own way separately from the broader movement.<br /><br />Roosevelt, in Olson's history, does not win strong marks for effective leadership.  She argues that Roosevelt led effectively during the early days of his presidency and following Pearl Harbor. The years 1939-- 1941, however, revealed an indecisive president, who had suffered public defeats in his court-packing scheme and in his attempts to purge his party from its more conservative elements. As a result, Olson argues, Roosevelt vacillated in his presidency, partly from fear of losing politically to the isolationists and partly because he simply did not know what to do.<br /><br />Olson shows the rise of isolationist sentiment with Lindbergh, politicians in Congress, and a broad-based movement called \\"America First\\".  The movement attracted many Americans, including highly intelligent, serious people but it also became a haven for anti-semites and those on the far right. There were many in the military establishment and in the Administration who also opposed to varying degrees America's involvement in the war.<br /><br />There were also strong, well-organized groups supporting intervention, and Olson shows the role they played in moving the Administration along. Olson describes each of the well-known steps leading to American intervention, from the destroyer transfer to Lend-Lease, and the Selective Service law to show that Roosevelt frequently was a lagging, reluctant participant. The President during this time, she argues, was more of a follower than a shaper of public opinion. Olson contends that public opinion was prepared to respond to strong decisive leadership that, unfortunately, was not forthcoming from the White House.<br /><br />The book offers a picture of American life in the late 1930's as Americans, Olson argues, were more concerned with new automobiles and economic well-being than with events across the ocean. She also shows some of the darker sides of the administration, with constant surveillance and spying on supporters of isolationism with attendant risks to civil liberties.  Olson portrays the \\"mothers in black\\", (conservative womens who marched for peace garbed in black dresses), the anti-semitism of FatherCoughlin and his followers, the Congressional investigation of Hollywood for its alleged role in promoting intervention, the intervention cartoons and activities of a young Theodore Geisel, (\\"Dr. Seuss) and much more of the period.<br /><br />In the summer of 1941, Lindbergh delivered a speech in Des Moines, Iowa widely perceived as anti-semitic which turned the tide against the America First movement. Lindbergh's wife Anna strongly counselled him against the speech, but Lindbergh as usual went his own way. The increasingly difficult Lindbergh marriage, and Anna's own activities receive substantial attention throughout this study.  Still, only with the attack on Pearl Harbor did Americans finally unite to prosecute the war.<br /><br />The book is lengthy but lively.  It holds the reader's attention. I thoght Olson's assessments of both Lindbergh and Roosevelt were reasonable and nuanced. I was surprised that the book says relatively little about the role of Harry Hopkins, Roosevelt's most trusted advisor. Besides the two major protagonists, there are two people that Olson greatly admires. The first is the British Ambassador to the United States, Lord Lothian, who worked tirelessly to convince Americans of the need to become involved in the war. The second is Wendell Willkie, who ran unsuccessfully for president against Roosevelt in 1940. Olson describes Willkie as \\"the man who more than any other private citizen helped unite the country behind the idea of aiding Britain and opposing Germany.\\" With some lapses in the latter part of the campaign, Willkie supported each of the interventionist initiatives.  Following his defeat, he worked with Roosevelt to promote American unity. \\"Wherever he went\\", Olson writes, \\"he talked about the importance of a united, democratic world, free from the taints of totalitarianism, imperialism, and colonialism.\\" Too little remembered today, Willkie, rather than Lindbergh or Roosevelt, comes close to being the hero of Olson's story.<br /><br />Olson offers a readable, insightful account of a pivotal moment in American life and of the difficulties and virtues of the democratic process. With the entry into the war, the country was able to unite, prosecute the war effort and, in Olson's words, \\"claim its future\\".<br /><br />Robin FriedmanCoughlin and his followers, the Congressional investigation of Hollywood for its alleged role in promoting intervention, the intervention cartoons and activities of a young Theodore Geisel, (\\"Dr. Seuss) and much more of the period.<br /><br />In the summer of 1941, Lindbergh delivered a speech in Des Moines, Iowa widely perceived as anti-semitic which turned the tide against the America First movement.

Following his defeat, he worked with Roosevelt to promote American unity. \\"Wherever he went\\", Olson writes, \\"he talked about the importance of a united, democratic world, free from the taints of totalitarianism, imperialism, and colonialism.\\" Too little remembered today, Willkie, rather than Lindbergh or Roosevelt, comes close to being the hero of Olson's story.<br /><br />Olson offers a readable, insightful account of a pivotal moment in American life and of the difficulties and virtues of the democratic process. With the entry into the war, the country was able to unite, prosecute the war effort and, in Olson's words, \\"claim its future\\".<br /><br />Robin Friedman

1885167776|5.0|I received an advanced marketing copy of The ONE Thing a few months ago and have been able to read it multiple times implementing the concept into the different areas of my life (spiritual, business, marriage, father, financial, physical, etc.) For me, this book has changed my life more than any other book second only to the Bible. Those are strong words that I do not say lightly. In just a short time my relationship with my wife has skyrocketed, my children are more confident and we have the deepest relationship we've ever had, I am in the best physical shape I've ever been in, my connection with Christ is stronger than it's ever been, my multiple businesses are breaking records, and my finances are at the highest point they've ever been. It almost sounds too good to be true. The concept is almost too simple to believe.<br /><br />Now let me disclose the fact that I've always been a focused, driven, success building person. I was not in bad shape, didn't have a difficult relationship with Christ or my wife, etc. I study and read at least 1-2 books per month primarily on success, business, God, and relationships. This book is the ONE book that fills the gap. What gap? The gap between being in the top 20% to being in the top 1% or 1/2% or maybe even #1 in the world. All of the other books from the \\"success\\" or \\"productivity\\" genre get you to the top 20%, but I haven't found one that fills the gap to #1 until now... The ONE Thing. The \\"lies\\" section is transformational (sometimes as a gut punch). It either picks up where those all-time foundational books leave off or turns them upside down and proves, with researched evidence, they were wrong. I love the fact that this book is not theory and gives piles of factual researched evidence for every section.<br /><br />I was surprised at how quickly results showed up once I lined up the dominoes in the right order as the book teaches. It's like if you drew a graph in the shape of a hockey stick. it seems pretty level and then all of the sudden it shoots right up. Let me give you an example of filling the gap from great results to extraordinary results in my life:<br /><br />In my physical health I had the first and second domino in reverse. Success principles will ask... what are the top 2-3 things most important to having good physical health? The normal response is - exercise and eat right. So I was obsessed with exercise. I started doing P90X, then P90X2, then Insanity, then Insanity Asylum. I was doing physical activities that I never thought would be possible. I was in great shape, but not extraordinary shape. I had to eat a lot more to just keep up with the amount of strain I was putting on my body. All good unless I missed a workout. I wasn't getting the \\"leanness\\" I wanted. Truly I wanted to see my abs. I started doing double workouts on certain days! Yes, not only doing an crazy intense exercise routine, but doing it twice a day. Although I became a physical machine that could do push ups with a medicine ball under each hand and foot, I wasn't hitting the AMAZING results I wanted. So as success books teach, I found models. I found all of my friends in the gym that had abs like I wanted. All of them said, \\"Abs are made in the kitchen, not the gym.\\" An indication that perhaps nutrition was more important than exercise for abs. Now I have The ONE Thing in my hands reading about the dominoes. I had the first two dominoes in the reverse. The ONE Thing teaches that no two things are equal.... pick one. For me, nutrition was more important than exercise to reach the results I wanted. That was The ONE Thing I could do such that by doing it would make everything else easier or unnecessary. I had been trying to knock down two dominoes (exercise & nutrition) simultaneously or in reverse by putting exercise before nutrition. Good results, not extraordinary. Fast forward to realigning the dominoes following the instructions laid out in the book... within 45 days down 30lbs, down 3% body fat, abs starting to show, more energy than ever, exercise 15 mins a day. More time, more energy, more results... just focusing on the right ONE Thing.<br /><br />In my business, I move the needle forward in just an hour or two a day. In my marriage, I found The ONE Thing which brought me closer to my wife didn't take as much time as the five things I was doing daily and it made a bigger impact than all five of the other things combined. In my fatherhood, I found The ONE Thing that improved my relationship with my children also set them in motion to have extraordinary results in school and actually took 10 mins a day instead of the hours I was spending driving them around doing what I \\"thought\\" was most important. In my relationship with God, I found The ONE Thing that would bring me closer to Him when done first in my day set off the rest of the day to being focused with clarity and purpose and led to all of the other dominoes falling correctly. In my personal finances, I found that just attacking the first domino over and over again without worrying about anything else has rapidly increased my net worth.<br /><br />I highly recommend taking the time after reading this book, maybe hours, to sit down and line up the dominoes in the different areas of your life. To figure out and experiment on finding The ONE Thing for each category and then chunk it down, as the book teaches, from deep into the future down to yearly, monthly, weekly, and then daily. Once I did that it all exploded. At the beginning it was very strange. I would finish The ONE Thing in each category of my life (9 categories) by about 2pm each day. Then I'd finish by lunch some days. I almost felt guilty because I wasn't doing a laundry list of the other \\"important\\" things in my life. It felt like something was wrong, but I wanted to really put this book to the test. So I let the other stuff go. Sometimes I would finish all of my weekly ONE Things by Thursday and then use Friday to do the rest of the 20% big rocks I didn't do because I did The ONE Thing each day. Then I would just not do the 80% at all, leaving a mess in certain areas. I allowed myself to be ok with the mess and the imbalance as taught in the \\"lies\\" section of the book. It was refreshing and terrifying at the same time not knowing what would collapse around me. Until suddenly I noticed that every part of my life I truly cared about was skyrocketing and all of the stuff I didn't care about... well I don't know what happened there because I don't pay attention to that anymore. I honestly don't even remember all of that stuff. I'm enjoying my life so much in the parts I do value that I don't even know what I'm \\"missing\\" in the unimportant parts.<br /><br />I am already teaching my 11 year old son this way of life because I want him to start with this mindset. Can't imagine how his life will be when he starts with this as a baseline. Like I said, for me, this book has impacted me second only to the Bible. A claim I do not take lightly and I mean from the bottom of my heart.

The cast is strong at this point and as with most new shows, will have to shake down into regulars. This is not the sort of premise that would normally interest me but I wanted to catch this at the start point in hopes it would offer more than one season. I wanted something as watchable as, \\"Elementary\\" and this just might do the trick. I'm in.<br />Update; Season 1 is complete and the show is getting some strong critical reviews. I seemed to have chosen a good, solid show that holds the promise of a lot of seasons to come. Check this one out.
0307352145|5.0|Quite: The Power of Introverts in World That Can't Stop Talking is an enlightening and powerful book for either side of the extroverted and introverted spectrum.  Author Susan Cain sheds light on the subject of introversion through a series of stories and begins her work by detailing how the powerful character of the introvert was lost to the outwardly charismatic and powerful extroverted personality.  The book first takes reader through a backdrop of extroversion that can make any self-conscious introvert feel guilty of being themselves.  However, this powerful technique is meant to open the reader's eyes to the cultural constraints placed on introversion in today's American society.<br /><br />Through historical accounts of different introverts, the introverted reader starts to understand how powerful introversion is in forging change and may even find themselves relating to some of the stories.  Extroverted readers, hopefully, see these historical accounts as intriguing and recognize the potential introverts have to catalyze change.  As an extreme introvert I started understanding why I feel uncomfortable in certain instances.  Public speaking or public displays have never been a strong suit of mine unless I can act my way through the situations.  I often need to push myself through this uncomfortable time and when it is over, I feel exhausted beyond understanding.  There have also been times in my life when I feel my \\"social battery\\" powering down.  At this point I become rather \\"grumpy\\" and sometimes unreasonable.  I find I want to hide in my room and take a nap.  As Cain explained, there is nothing wrong with that.  That is how an introvert recharges.  It takes a lot of energy to be social.  Cain also points out that being an introvert does not limit a person to the life of a hermit.  Introverts are perfectly capable of social interaction but she reminds us that introverts are careful speakers who will often listen far more than they will speak.<br /><br />Quiet had a significant impact on me as a reader and I highly recommend it to anyone, introvert or otherwise.  I no longer feel I have to justify myself or make excuses for my lack of social desires.  I understand myself and others around me in a much better way because of Susan Cain's work.  Easily, this can become the introverts \\"self-help\\" or better yet, \\"self-realization\\" guide.et had a significant impact on me as a reader and I highly recommend it to anyone, introvert or otherwise.

B009AMAGQM|3.0|I like the Beautiful Creatures book saga, it's charming, full of action, love and mystery, which is enjoyable for any teen who likes other popular book sagas turned into movies like The Hunger Games or Twilight.<br />Now with Beautiful Creatures, we get the beginning of a new saga (but I doubt there will be a second part considering how bad it did at the box office) that follows the same formula for any supernatural love story: two different persons fall in love and there's a secret. One of them is a witch (or caster). The movie is entertaining, and the love story is just fine. I didn't saw any chemistry between the two leads, besides the movie was slow, and it gets boring sometimes (I almost fell asleep in the movie theater). But overall, it's a decent adaptation but it could have been better. I don't know why they choose to make it so different to the book that was amazing, haunting and darker than the movie. Watch it if you liked the Twilight Saga.

B00BHU2A7I|4.0|\\"Hitchcock\\" is a fun movie. It is well shot, has a tight story and fantastic performances delivered with an utter joy that is impossible to miss. It is not perfect, being that it is based upon a real person and real events, but so much of the spirit and wit of Alfred Hitchcock is found here that the liberties taken are easy to excuse. I have not enjoyed watching a \\"bio pic\\" of this kind in years and Anthony Hopkins has finally come alive again in his role as good ol' \\"Hitch\\". I cannot remember how long ago it was that I was able to watch Anthony Hopkins and forget that I was watching Anthony Hopkins. Here he exudes sheer glee and an intuitiveness about his character in every scene that pays off in spades. Scarlett Johansson as Janet Leigh, Jessica Biel as Vera Miles, and James D'Arcy as Anthony Perkins are used sparingly but very effectively and Helen Mirren is spectacular as Hitchcock's faithful yet long suffering wife Alma Reville.<br /><br />The story centers on the period in Hitchcock's life when he was making his horror masterwork \\"Psycho\\". The book, based on the demented murders committed by Ed Gein, was making a slowly rising stir at the time and Hitchcock was looking for something truly new. He was a legend in his own time, but he was tired of television and even more tired of listening to the studios demanding he make more of the same types of films that he had already directed for them. Finding absolutely no support from studio executives who feared the brutal murder and transvestitism in \\"Psycho\\" would cause an uproar in the movie going public, Hitch funded the movie himself and delivered, with many setbacks, what is now known as his most popular film ever.<br /><br />It takes a few moments to get onboard with the way the movie is presented. It delves into the mindset of Hitchcock in visually disturbing ways and does not follow the typical \\"Based On True Events\\" style we are used to. This, however, works in the movie's favor. The presentation forces the audience to think and participate in the story instead of letting it roll over them. Hitchcock was especially good at getting the audience involved and a movie about his methods and life should feel the same way. The director, Sacha Gervasi, layers the story, plot, and character elements in a way that brings us into the film and makes us more than viewers. We are, instead, Hitchcock's co-conspirators and confidantes.<br /><br />I went into this film with reservations about what was to come only to have my concerns carefully removed and tossed away as one discards a gum wrapper. They became unimportant and not at all relevant to the wonderful movie I was about to watch. If you haven't seen it yet, make the effort to see \\"Hitchcock\\" soon and as Hitch would say, you'll have a \\"Good Evening\\".

1592407889|4.0|I really don't know how Ms McClaine can show her face after this book being published. She had to have known about the sexual abuse her child was experiencing. She knew the man, she knew the life, she knew all of it.  Surely one of her psychics would have told her......I don't know it was sad, sick and I think the Father belonged in prison.  Disgusting man. The book was well written and I believe every bit of it. I hope Sachi made a ton of money from the book, and I hope her Mother is ashamed of herself.

He was so happy to have finally found this movie again. The item arrived fast before the date that was given. It was well worth the purchase to see the look on his face when it arrived... and the price was awesome too!

B007CGLRWA|4.0|I found this movie to be very interesting and thought-provoking. While some of the subject matter was hard to watch or think about, it was presented in a very real and compelling way. Adrien Brody had a great performance, as well as Betty Kaye. The movie is intense. If you're looking for a light-hearted movie or something with a happy ending like other films about disadvantaged kids in inner city schools, look somewhere else. Detachment isn't like that, but it is quite fantastic. I think it illustrates some important truths about the education system today.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|No matter how much we ignore it, the truth is the truth. We all call our selves \\"individuals\\" but are we really. We all live the same life. We all mourn, we all cry, we all try to remember the good things but in the end only have scars. And it is with this truth that we can all relate to a book like this. Because within every piece of writing there is a piece of your life story. So I praise this book, because it made me laugh and cry, and made me realize that every time we read, were learning a piece of our future. And it might not make sense to you, but who really cares. We all live the same lives, only to different extremes. Some infinities are bigger than other infinities.
B0004Z33F0|5.0|Rambo is a classic, and always will be. Mr. Stallone is one of the all time action heros and if you have Rambo 1 & 2 you must have 3. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do.

B006LA6IW2|5.0|Written by a true American Hero.  Chris Kyle will open your eyes to the world you won't get from television, radio or any news broadcast.  If you think you know what's going on in Iraq, prepare to be surprised.  If you're curious about the mentality of a Navy Seal or a sniper, prepare to be educated.  Probably the most important part of this book is getting to know the man behind the rifle... a family man, a father and a husband who's not afraid to tell it like it is.  Chris Kyle's death was a tragedy and I only wish there were more books to follow.

1476712042|5.0|I never write reviews. Although, I do read a ton of them I've never written many. I'm writing a review today because this is by far one of the very best book I've ever read. The characters have so many layers to them that you an really feel what they're going through. You want to punch and hug them at the same time. Very rarely do I obsess over a book but this one is worth obsessing over. Travis and Abby are the main characters and unlike normal romance type novels it doesn't end with the typical they get together...book over type of endings. The world isn't perfect and life doesn't end that way and the author really explores that.<br />The next book she has is from Travis's point of view with (fingers crosses) books from his brothers (he has four). Such a beautiful complex story.

B0035YTG30|5.0|Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn are excellent in Roman Holiday. It is a great classic! If you haven't seen it, it's worth renting.
B00B1E6FF8|1.0|The writing is bad. The direction is mediocre. The editing is choppy. The acting is terrible: one of the male characters mumbles worse than Brando, and the female lead is annoying. It was one of those films where one keeps checking to see how much more of it is left. I only stuck with it to get to the capture scene and then discovered one couldn't see what was going on. Suddenly there's a body (Ben Laden, I presume) badly lit on the floor being shot more times. How this film was in the running at the Oscars is incomprehensible.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Great movie, non-stop action, totally LOVE this movie!!!! Can't wait for the next James Bond movie to come out. Great scenery and plot!

B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is simple and easy to play, and it is very addicting. Highly recommended for anyone with time to kill
B00AQB2A3I|3.0|I was very much looking forward to this disc, but I have to admit that I am somewhat disappointed by it. I am not writing this to simply be contrary to the many five star reviews here. I would just like to open up a more critical view of someone's work who I truly respect, but feel may have gone somewhat off course. Steven Wilson is one of my favorite artists, so this is utterly surprising to me, yet no matter how many times I listen to this disc, I cannot really find the same level of merit that exists in the majority of his previous work.<br /><br />What I found so interesting and enjoyable on the last four Porcupine Tree discs and on Grace for Drowning is mostly missing here. The juxtaposition of updated early 70's prog elements with modern experimentation and metal guitar is mostly absent. The music on Raven just seems to be Steven's direct emulation of past prog music, adding nothing really new to the formula. There are equal parts of King Crimson, Gentle Giant, ELP, early Genesis, and Van Der Graaf Generator stitched together with a modest spin put on them and re-hashed in a familiar way. Mind you, this is an impressive and challenging feat to accomplish, but it just seems a bit too close to the original form. There is not enough really new or interesting here to warrant the work and skill put into the performance.<br /><br />The musical performances are certainly top-notch, but how inspirational can they really be when everyone is so focused on merely aping a style from the past? I am very disheartened by this turn in Steven's output, and hope that he will return to the more challenging, thought-provoking music he is known and respected for. Perhaps by ditching the, though admittedly very skilled, outside musicians and returning to the stellar co-creators and partners in Porcupine Tree he can re-discover his past greatness and make another album that is truly relevant. The Raven That Refused to Sing is really just a simple homage to the past. It does not break any new ground and is not much more than a minor, if exceedingly well-crafted, love letter to a past era of music.k any new ground and is not much more than a minor, if exceedingly well-crafted, love letter to a past era of music.

B0075MFS9Y|3.0|My girlfriend bought this CD, and we recently listened to it on a long car drive.  The band is quite good, musically interesting with excellent songwriting and lyrics.<br /><br />Unfortunately, you get the impression that the singer is surrounded by a band full of yes-men.  Although he clearly _can_ sing, and will occasionally do so, usually at the start of the song, but too often he vacillates between \\"God I wish I was Bob Dylan\\" under-articulated singing and some sort of whiny, gaspy (and often flat) falsetto moan.  When he's low in his register, he can keep a pitch and work a good song, but somebody really needs to whack him with a newspaper (\\"Bad hipster!!\\") when he decides to inject his \\"personal artistic vision\\".<br /><br />So, great music, great lyrics, but until somebody talks with the lead singer, they're pouring talent down the drain.
006198969X|5.0|I LOVE this book! I especially love how she shows you how to take one piece of clothing and make it different styles just by changing the accessories! Everything about the makeup and hair is perfect too! Also the stuff about what to pack for trips was perfect! I was able to use the list for my summer vacation trip! The tips for shopping for great bargains really helped too because now I have a better eye for great deals because I know what to look for! This is the perfect book for people who like to start from the basics and work up from there!

B004X75RK4|5.0|Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock) is a very efficient and therefore somewhat intimidating editor-in-chief of a New York publishing house. Her assistant editor Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds) is equally efficient. But then Immigration catch up with Tate because, despite being a Canadian, there are errors in the paperwork granting her the right to work in the U.S. She is faced with the prospect of deportation out of the country for a period of at least 12 months. Ever resourceful, she decides to marry Paxton, which takes him rather by surprise. Now Tate beliefs that Paxton probably lives in some hovel of a N.Y. apartment, but to celebrate their `engagement' they go to visit Paxton's family home in Alaska. Paxton's mother, Grace (Mary Steenburgen) and father Joe (Craig T. Nelson) are less than pleased to have the news of their son's impending marriage thrust upon them so unexpectedly. Back in Alaska, Paxton's ex-girlfriend Gertrude (Malin Akerman) appears on the scene but, being a small-town girl, seems quite content to let her boyfriend pursue his life in New York. So will Tate and Paxton really get married? This is a very witty movie, as we have come to expect from Sandra Bullock (former Miss Congeniality), and is thoroughly entertaining.

0553386794|4.0|I have finally read A Game of Thrones. I loved it! I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. I also got myself the audio with it AND I even watched the first season of the HBO show based on the book. I am thrilled to finally post my review of it.<br /><br />The first book is all about the development of the main kingdoms. The Stark family is the primary focus. Lady Stark (Catelyn), King Stark, and the siblings, along with the bastard son conceived in an illegitimate affair, Jon Snow - who is one of my favorite characters at first.<br /><br />This book is all about the characters, more than it is about the themes, and maybe the rest will be as well. I began to have ambiguous feelings about Lady Stark at first, thinking she is more of a hard because she has no compassion toward her illegitimate son, Jon, but later towards the book she is a noble, loyal, and supremely strong Queen and mother. I end up admiring her towards the end of the novel.<br /><br />Daenerys is one of my favorite characters through the book. I looked forward to the chapters that involved her transformation from sister slave, to Dothraki Queen - Khalessi. Alone, she wins the heart of her warrior, and later owns her place and territory as a female leader. I was rooting for her the whole time, as cheesy as that may sound.<br /><br />Arya is another one of my favorite characters because she's the unexpected survivor. She is also unconventional. While other girls like to dress up and look forward to becoming princesses she knows how to shoot a bow very well and love to learn sword fighting. I also enjoyed Arya's character because she's the only one who has a true bond with Jon.<br /><br />Bran is a character I'd like to see develop more throughout the rest of the books. Even though his accident sort of casts him out of the most of the first book, I think he'll play a pivotal role later on, just a gut instinct.<br /><br />I loved this book. If you have heard about this book and you wish to know what it's about, don't waste another minute... READ IT!

B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I've been playing this game ever since I downloaded it and I'm very addicted to it. I take it in every night when I get in my recliner and play until I can't stay awake any longer
B000000XB9|4.0|A very good collection of songs for the causal listener, mostly songs that hit the air waves. Few songs are missing, some songs have the radio play songs which  are shorter.  Songs such as  Cotton Fields, Graveyard Train and  Long as I Can See the Light might have been included just to show the other side of  CCR. I have every album but albums are such a pain to take care of plus the getting up and down. For causal listening MP3's  are fine but  analog sounds much better than CD's or tape format. All in all this is a pretty good collection of CCR.
B00B3HJMLM|5.0|Another fabulous CD from Luke Bryan!  All of these song are &#34;spring break&#34; ready! I forsee several number one hits from this one!
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|This very well done for sound and video. The boys seem very relaxed including Joe. For those diehard fans yes members have dropped out as with almost every group that has been around  for seemly for ever. The sound is still pure Eagles and for the most part (95%) the voices have not changed. If by chance you enjoy Joe Walsh then this a DVD for you, Funk #49 from the James Gang days and a couple others as a solo act or with the Gang. One song I wish they had done was 'Ashes, Rain and I' but sorry it's not here.<br /><br />This DVD is one of the best as far  quality of music and video I own.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|This movie is another Disney hit! As an older guy in his late 30's I really enjoyed the nostalgic characters and how the movie kind of jokingly mocks the genre. My son, who is 3, loves this movies so it is something we enjoy together. The best part is when my two year old daughter dances and sings to the &#34;sugar rush&#34; song during the credits. Overall entertaining and reasonable family entertainment.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Freakin' Awesome!  No wonder it is a hit on television with all the drama, realistic emotions and turmoil.  Love it
B007REV4YI|5.0|As usual, you either love or hate James Bond. Most of my friends who are not fans who have seen it say they liked it. It is definitely a better sequel to Casino Royal. The week it came out and all the brick and mortars had it on sale for $19.99. Amazon dropped the price to be competitive. With the tax and free shipping, it was a better deal. I had no problem waiting two days to get it. With two toddlers, it isn't like I am in a rush to see it right when it comes out. If you didn't get it for that price, wait about 4 months when you can get it for $15.00. Enjoy the action. The movie is good.
B005BZQVJ8|5.0|Paul is hilariously funny and outright comical.  I love the little green guy and enjoy all the quirky moments and side splitting laughs.  You'll love this movie if you have a dark sense of humor about things.  Great job.
B005IZLPME|4.0|This movie I had not seen in the theater.  Since we bought a new 3-D TV we decided to get this one for our collection.
B00BCOGM78|5.0|GREAT ALBUM.  IT DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS.  QUICKLY GROWING ON ME JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER CLUTCH ALBUM. 5/5
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|This movie you couldn't hardly watch.  I had trouble with the picture hanging up.  Very Poor!!  I did receive an email from Amazon stating that there was an issue and they were not going to charge me for this video.
B008OOYALE|3.0|I love this game but all my devices are androids. The designers are no longer trying to offer all of the new cool stuff on aneroid. Iphones have the updates first as the designers are iphone people.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This was the first 3-D movie that I saw at the theater when it came out.  Decided to get one for my home collection.
1400034205|5.0|Fortunately, I have never seen the film adaptations of this novel. Had I seen one of those, I probably would not have read the book. And the lose would have been all mine. This work is Maughum at his finest. As usual, the Edwardian prose and sensibilities are a feast served up with inventive and original plot and character development. Highly recommended.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|C'mon It's Angry Birds with Star Wars theme! There's no lag or anything to hinder the game performance. Enjoy the purchase
B009KEN87O|5.0|Old school fun time waster. It's easy to play with a hint of challenge for the non hardcore gamer. I'd recommend it!
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Basically, it's a buggy version of Hydro Thunder. You ride your buggy through clock to gain more time extensions and discover new scenes
B0061PEAUY|5.0|I have most of her books and thought this book was one of the better ones.  I gave it 5 stars because it was fast paced and enough twists to thoroughly  keep me entertained.  While she provided a lot of back filler, it was integral to the story and kept me interested. I did not guess the end (a turn off in some books) and felt like I had to read it cover to cover without putting it down.
0062082353|5.0|This man was a true American Hero, Had A Big Heart..So Sorry He Is Gone..I Think He Should Get The GMH For All He Saved, I Believe This Book Is A Good Read...
B003O86FMW|5.0|The thrill of it seems to never end! This only leaves me craving for more!! I now have to get the third boom ans start reading it as soon as possible!
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|I must say there are things about this that scream indy film but the acting is good.  The subject matter is handled with artistry.  A bold performance by the leads and the supporting cast does not disappoint.  Helen Hunts transition at the end of the sessions was a bit cliche but well acted.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfer s is a great game to.play since its addicting and creative and the director did a awesome set of character's and did well. On the design of the background
0307460444|5.0|i let my friend borrow this for her wedding cupcakes and I had to get myself another one cuz I couldnt live without it! The best frosting tips and recipies ever
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. The hunger games drew me in and it became a need for me to read this book.
B00B2166BS|5.0|It does not take very long to charge with this pogo cable for my tablet it does it in about half the time than the standard usb cable.
B007EW9ISM|4.0|I really like how this stylus writes and sketches.  It is a little bulky for me, but I like the fact that there it is only one piece and has no metal.  It makes it a great stylus for kids if you can get them to use one.
B004HO6I4W|5.0|My boys love watching this movie, it's a great movie. I loved that it was just $15, best deal .
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I think this is the best book ever. I've only started the the hunger games and already I love them
B0030IIZ56|5.0|My boys are in love with this movie. Being a mother of two I look for all the deals I can get and Amazon had the best price by far.
B000W91RUG|5.0|This show obviously isn't for everyone, but I find it extremely funny. I watched it for the first time a couple of months ago, and now I DVR every old (and new) episode I can find. I am seldom disappointed. These actors do a great job, and for pure entertainment as a sitcom: five stars!
B0030IIYWA|5.0|My boys are in love with this movie. Being a mother of two I look for all the deals I can get and Amazon had the best price by far.
B0088TG252|3.0|Period.  Nothing extra special about the plot.  The acting was excellent and therefore carried the movie beyond where the writer(s) did.
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|I just love this game! The graphics are great. I have started with the free game and will buy the full game next. So far i love all your games.
B00AYHKIZ6|4.0|It's real Bowie with rock music instead of techno.  I like every track which surprised me.  I haven't liked a Bowie album this completely in a long time.  Very happy with this one.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|when I try the things for free bucks it doesn't work so I would've rated 5 if that was fixed.  &mdash;SlashedMouse
0761171703|5.0|I have been following the work of Jordan Matter on facebook and through various blogs for a while, and I really wanted to get this book to add to the collection of great inspiration for my photo studio in Geneva (Switzerland).<br /><br />I purchased this book and can only say that the images are just stunning, beautiful, connection between the models and the photographer and when applicable assistants+Makeup artists is truly a piece of art. Some of these shots are just mindboggling,and every caption, the words, the little sentences through the book make you smile, laugh, think, react... and it just feels like pushing yourself that much further for a project, something different.<br /><br />Thank you Jordan for the inspiration, and congratulations for succeeding in making this book a reality after having managed to pursue the whole project for such a long time.<br /><br />Great book, Great buy if you're looking for a fun set of images, ideas, and simply a very fresh look at photography. Have a lovely time reading it, as much as i have had looking at it and flipping through it so many times.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best I have had so far. My friends gave me a list of games. Subway surfers was one of them. This is the best game its updated it awesome!!!!:)
B00BF11UM0|3.0|Liked the movie but I had expected more action.  More of a factual history of the woman who found Bin Laden and her struggle.  Good movie but my expectations were different.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This game is amazing. Addicting and full of fun, it is fun for everyone! There is nothing wrong with how the game is or anything like that, so those people out there who don't have this game who probably fall in love with this game. Until next time, bye!!! :)
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great weather app. Even better since updating corrected our town misspelling. Now it is correct!<br />Love the graphics. Also love so much info in one place. Nice to be able to add locations esp when we are on vacation.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book leaves you speechless. Every word has you wondering what will happen. I love it. I finished it in 3 days, never putting it down. Words can't describe how great it is. It is one of those books that is always on your mind, all day and all night, just begging to read it. I WANT A SEQUEL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0307341577|3.0|Like the Scottish author, Val McDermid, Gillian Flynn is adept at exploring the dark side of human experience. Libby Day is now an adult, having survived the massacre of her family when she was seven years old. Her brother, Ben, is serving a life sentence, partly condemned by her testimony. When her savings (accumulated from sympathy donations) start to diminish, the traumatised Libby has to look around for some fresh source of income.<br /><br />She is contacted by a strange organisation known as the Kill Club. Its members are fixated on the \\"Farmhouse Satan Sacrifices\\" and certain that Ben Day is not responsible for the triple murder. They are eager for Libby to follow up their theories and speak to those who were around on that day. For an initial $500 payment, Libby swallows her reluctance and sets out to pursue the truth.<br /><br />Libby Day's combination of coldness and vulnerability are totally convincing.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I stumbled on this book while reading a blog post of Hugh Howey's (author of Wool, Shift Saga, Molly Fyde).  Mr. Howey, whose writing I thoroughly enjoyed mentioned that this was his current favorite book.  If you like video games, MMORPG's, the 80's or are just looking for a great good guys vs. bad guys story this is the book for you. I liked this book so much I bought a second, hard copy, for my son.<br /><br />I can't recommend it enough!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i love this game. i could play it all day everyday. it is the best. it makes you want to plsy more with the missions that you have to do.
B004APVI1G|5.0|If you are looking for THE movie to demo your new 3D set, this is the one for you. From all 3D animation movies I have seen, this is by far the most impressive. The Legend of the Guardians is not just a 2D flick where 3D provides the little extra for 3D enthusiast, you will see this movie in a whole new perspective. Once you have seen it in 3D, the otherwise impressive flying scenes, look flat in 2D - 3D makes it an immersive experience. Even my kids who usually take their glasses off mid film, were spellbound till then end.<br /><br />I just wanted to comment on the 3D effect, all else has been already said. This movie has a 6.9 IMDb rating.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|gameloft has done it again with an amazing game, except this time its free! awesome interface and really fun, 5 stars
B005K2Z2O2|5.0|Excellent sleeve for the current gen. Kindle! Quality workmanship, strong velcro flap enclosure, snug/secure fit for the kindle, and a variety of colors/styles makes this a sleeve that stands out from the rest and appealing to both men and women!
B0084B1T8Y|4.0|This book was very interesting and a little boringish because you could understand animals when they speak this book was o.k.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|very good graphics. more mini games would improve the overall games experience and provide more options of what to do to entertain yourself while tasks are being completed.
1935251740|2.0|I've bought this book after hearing much praise of it on TV. I thought this would be something Hawking or Brian Greene style (I have several Hawking and Greene books and love reading them for pleasure). So, I thought it will be  a science book presenting some new theory of time.<br /><br />This book however is vulgar mix of cheap philosophy, science X-Files style, melodramatic memoirs/mysticism Carlos Castaneda style, vague religious pantheistic ideas and other such vulgar stuff. Donnie Darko movie style that's what it is. But the Donnie Darko movie did have a clear idea to present and this book does not.<br /><br />Who am I an idiot teenage girl from some distant village to read this stuff, if I want to read this stuff I do have better works. I can read Castaneda, Lewis, Coelho for better entertainment. For science I can read Hawking and Greene. This book is neither quality science nor quality fiction. It will insult your intellect. Avoid it.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Virtual City Playground is an alright app. It does everything it is designed to do correctly. It has its own little twist to the common city builder games; trucks, business interaction, and community people.  Though... it does lack a couple things that could make game play easier; such that of a quick in depth tutorial, and easy to follow instructions for pricing of construction and upgrades, and some simple things like that.  other than those minor complaints of mine, the app is very excellent and I'm not disappointed by G5 Entertainment. Brilliant app.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|As a fan from the beginning, after a decade of silence I was beyond excited to learn that David Bowie was back- and not just \\"Heathen\\" or \\"Reality\\" back but with arguably his finest album since the Berlin Trilogy and \\"Scary Monsters\\". But I had my doubts after viewing the videos for \\"Where Are We Now?\\" and \\"The Stars (Are Out Tonight)\\", though both wonderful as videos, the songs themselves left me unimpressed, both sounding like they could have been extra tracks from either of his last two releases. Aside from those missteps, any doubts I had were quickly dispelled by the opening (title) track, one of his best in his formidable repertoire. Full of jagged menace and featuring one of my favorite lines \\"Here am I/ Not quite dying/ My body left to rot in a hollow tree\\", \\"The Next Day\\" feels both forward-looking and with a hint of sounds from earlier eras, like most of the best songs on this project. \\"Dirty Boys\\" follows- a skronky sax-infused funk workout. For me, the next three tracks throw off the momentum established by the first two, though I do like \\"Love Is Lost\\". The momentum returns with \\"Valentine's Day\\" (with a nod to Ziggy?) and the ascending/descending melody of the wonderfully inventive \\"If You Can See Me\\" which is the first song that doesn't seem to have any suggestion of his previous works. \\"I'd Rather Be High\\" is also like this and it's one of the strongest (not to mention strangest) antiwar songs I've heard. I love the Beatlesque bass line and that the lyrics go from obscure/surreal to realistic and back again. \\"Boss Of Me\\" is DB at his funk pop best- a tribute to Iman? My late wife was a \\"small town girl\\" who at her best was the boss of me so it really tugs at my heartstrings. The next song that makes a big impression on me is the anthemic powerhouse \\"(You Will) Set The World On Fire\\", kind of an extension of Bowie's fascination with The Pixies. The official final track is stunning in every sense of the word- \\"Heat\\" is melodically and vocally minimalist with hallucinatory shades of atmospherics (courtesy of returning producer Tony Visconti) and the haunting lines \\"My father ran the prison/ But I am a seer/ I am a liar\\".<br /><br />Had I sequenced the album, any of the bonus tracks would have replaced \\"The Stars\\" and \\"Where Are We Now?\\" (though on repeated listens, I'm beginning to appreciate the melancholy feel of that one). Of the three bonus tracks, I like \\"Plan\\" the most- it's the riskiest of them, another minimalist piece and the only instrumental. It's like something from \\"Low\\" hurled into the future, much like \\"Heat\\".<br /><br />Mr. Bowie has once again surprised, delighted and provoked me with a completely unexpected return to form. \\"I'll take you there\\" he sings and delivers on that in spades.<br /><br />-For Janicet with hallucinatory shades of atmospherics (courtesy of returning producer Tony Visconti) and the haunting lines \\"My father ran the prison/ But I am a seer/ I am a liar\\".<br /><br />Had I sequenced the album, any of the bonus tracks would have replaced \\"The Stars\\" and \\"Where Are We Now?\\" (though on repeated listens, I'm beginning to appreciate the melancholy feel of that one).

B002PQ7JQK|5.0|I was very pleased with the conversion to blueray. It has been years since I had seen the show, so it was like seeing an old friend  ( I was around in 1966 for the first showings).I highly recommend this series to any trek fan, and to any fan of SF(ignore the dated science).
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this app is really cool I love it I reccommend this app for people who like taking care of horses like feeding them and grooming them.
B001EBV0NU|5.0|This is a very funny movie and the Mars spaceship looks very realistic.  Jack Nicholson does a good job of acting.
0307341550|5.0|Very, very rarely do I consider a book worth a 5 star rating. I have never ventured beyond 5. But this book was beyond the pale in that it was full of plot and well described characters throughout. It will be with me for a good long while. It was better than GONE GIRL.
B002W5GPVE|5.0|As I am in the beginning stages of conducting case study research for my doctoral dissertation, this book was recommended by my professor and was exactly what I needed to provide me direction and framework as I go forward.
0785162348|4.0|This book will become perfect if the story board of the final battle is also included. However, it is still recommended.
1442359315|3.0|Entertaining feel good story but not biblical. The only way to the father is through the son but he did not mention Jesus at all until the end of the book when he was describing a painting at the church.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Played two of the angry birds and love Rio, also got my grandkids hooked, even go back and try for extra stars.
B00APUYWYA|2.0|I watched this movie because of all the great reviews and was surprised to see it was not very good. The singing was fair as well as the music numbers. The one to watch was Bring It On some years back about cheerleader competion  which was much better movie. Save your money on the one.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Saw all the movies and hard to get to theater, love to be able to order it and watch at home. So funny.
B0024CEY36|5.0|Ken Follett wrote a great book as he usually does.  An easy history lesson and a surprise ending completed the book
B004GYY714|5.0|Had my kindle for over a year and thought I couldn't get my favorite radio station on it. I found this and YES! I now have my favorite station to listen to when I'm in another room.
1476733953|4.0|Nicely original and a fast read.  Does read like the collection of short stories or serials, that it is.  Will be looking forward to more from Mr. Howey.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I have read all of Patricia Cornwell books and was so anxious for her next book to come out, Have it on my kindle and love it so much.
B000FBJG04|5.0|Great individualized view of history, well researched and masterfully put together. A must read for anybody interested in the great battles of WWII.
B003OCWF6I|5.0|One of the more underrated movies of it's year. I saw it on the big-screen and liked it enough to purchase on Blu-Ray. It's an easy-to-watch movie with great action and awesome humor. The cast was great and it's a good movie to just pop in and watch any time.
B001NE80P4|5.0|It was a good finale to the other two movies.  Its a fun and positive movie that can be enjoyed by all ages.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|If you are looking for a well written good action book about military tactics and history, this book is a must!!!!
B000VAPZM2|4.0|This was a good segway from the first movie.  Not my favorate, but very entertaining. I would definitely recommend this movie, in fact I have to several people.
B00526ZKYS|4.0|Love is a disease; while it may feel like an illness sometimes, I can't imagine a life without compassion, touch or comforting others in their time of need or sadness.  I was intreged by the relationships between friends, family and the 'cured' with the 'incurred.'  Oliver had a great ending and I was left wanting to read the next book.
B009FZFONO|5.0|It's so easy to love this show!  Season three was all I needed it to be!  You'll enjoy every episode!
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|While the blues isn't everyone's cup of tea, for those who love the blues, well, this album is incredible. Never-before-heard track, Jimi playing what he loved to play and playing it in the way only he could, &#34;People, Hell & Angels&#34; is Jimi at his absolute best. If you love Jimi or if you love the blues or, like me, you love both, then this album is a MUST HAVE for your collection!
B00127RAJY|4.0|I have been working out on a consistent basis for many years. I 6 hour hikes up steep terrain with no problems. I work out in the gym, etc. I therefore thought this would be very easy. I guess it was the lunges/squats that got me as I'm not used to doing them. The day after doing this I could barely walk.  I am on day two post-work out and still hobbling around. I think that part of the problem is that I only had 8 pound weights and that is too much to use in conjunction with aerobic style moves/lunges.  I am going to go out and buy 3 and 5 pound weights.  I'm looking forward to climbing back in to the saddle again tomorrow.
B002RXMG00|5.0|I hate to admit it, but this was the first time I have ever seen Psycho.  It was a classic thriller.  I loved every moment and it kept me on my toes.  Thank you, Amazon, for having this movie available for instant streaming!
B005GIS1WA|5.0|Very cute movie! It held the attention of my 4 year old son so much he watched it twice. Very good storyline.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Can't get enough.  Great cast and the wardrobe is the best.  Look forward to many more seasons in the future.
B008ACC9CM|5.0|Their story is so touching and beautiful music! Watch the video on you tube, you won't be disappointed. amazing kids
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|That I keep coming back to.  Yes you spend a lot of time tapping resources, but at least there's always something to do.
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|Another great release from Halestorm!  Lzzy Hale's powerhouse vocals are unmatched in rock today!  Buy this!  You won't regret it!
0525952926|5.0|KEN FOLLETT IS AN EXCELLENT AUTHOR.  HAVE READ BOOK ONE; ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL.  BOOK TWO WAS JUST AS GOOD.  WAITIN FOR BOOK THREE TO COME OUT (2014 I THINK).
B001NLKXK2|4.0|Very insightful look at the progression of dementia through the main character's own eyes. It is reflective of the trials and tribulations one must endure as the disease progresses.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Always enjoy his CD's. Magical voice. Cant get enough of him and his music. Will always buy his new albums.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|From the smug, presumptive title, to the lifeless plot, down to the self-centered, half-written characters, this movie was so obnoxious.  Which is to say that it lived up to expectations; the trailer made this look insufferable.  But when a few friends whom I trust said that they enjoyed it, I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />There were definitely a few laughs here and there, but overall I found it shrill, pessimistic, and unlikeable (particularly when it comes to the characters).  Judd Apatow's career has been a case of diminishing returns, in my opinion.  Not a whole lot more to say.
B008J34466|5.0|VERY SELDOM DO YOU GET A CD THAT YOU ENJOY EVERY TRACK. THIS IS THE BEST CD (IN MY OPINION) THAT I HAVE FROM PINK. WORTH EVERY PENNY.<br />I BUY ALL MY CD'S FROM AMAZON. (YES, I STILL BUY THE CD).
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|I love this show....super entertaining it makes me laugh right out loud!!! I wasn't sure about it when I bought it but quickly fell in love.....had to hurry and buy the second and third season as well!!
B000001DZM|5.0|I HAVE WATCHED THIS MOVIE AT LEAST 20 TIMES AND JUST HAD TO HAVE THE SOUND TRACK.....GREAT SONGS, FUN TO WORK OUT OR RUN WITH.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Wanted Man was a little different in that Reacher didn't go it solo.  The ending came a little soon with unresolved issues for the FUN to wrap up.  I recommend all 17 books in the series.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|WRAPPED AND BRAND NEW AT A GREAT AMAZON PRICE. I THOUGHT I HAD THIS, AND WHEN I REALIZED I DIDN'T, I WENT STRAIGHT TO AMAZON.<br />I MAY BE OLD FASHIONED BUYING CD'S, BUT, I PUT THEM ON MY IPOD AND THEN PASS THEM ON TO SOMEONE ELSE THAT WANTS THEM.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|This book seems to have several writers, the tone is not consistent.  The story needs to be told, but it is not well written.
B005VMSATA|3.0|It actually has some light humor which makes it more interesting. It's a comic book movie with some good graphics.  It's more o kid 's movie but also a Sunday afternoon flick too.
B008Y1RTUG|2.0|That's about all it's worth-- something to kill time before you watch what you want to watch. Yes, it's pathetic, but I was in a hotel room with only one cable channel, so I sat through this movie.<br /><br />I've seen about 20 minutes of one of the Twilight films and thought it was appalling. I can't understand why Kristen Stewart never closes her mouth. Is that some new style? Looking like a mouth-breather? Anyhow, I had very low expectations for her part. Which is maybe why I thought she was actually one of the better parts of this wretched film. I thought she did a good job as the basically uninteresting character of Snow White. I mean, it's not like there was a whole lot to work with.<br /><br />I thought the biggest downfall of this film wasn't a particular actor but the incredibly PURPLE writing. My. God. Who told this person they could write dialogue? It was a cringe-worthy event from beginning to end. Especially the Queen, whose role was embarrassingly bombastic. And they the pathetic 20 second attempt to humanize her?? Hey, this is a FAIRY TALE it's okay to have a bad character who is just a bad character. If you want depth of character read some George RR Martin or some other adult book.<br /><br />I gave this movie 2 stars because of its stunning cinematography. It is visually moving even with the stupid dialogue. Oh yean, and because the Huntsman is nice eye-candy.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|PROOF OF HEAVEN OPENS AWARENESS INTO OUR PERSONAL LIVES & WHERE WE CAME FROM & What awaits AFTER THIS LIFE....I AM VERY GRATEFUL FOR DR.

B00BI73CVI|3.0|Just be aware that 99% of this movie is singing.  Kind of hard to hear everything that is being sung.  If you like musicals you'll like this.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is so much fun to play in ur kindle fire and any other eletonics. I don't really want to play anymore games only star girl and minecraft
0060922583|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read. It's very helpful in describing all the concepts inside of the book, so you don't even need to understand anything going in. Need to pick up more of Talbot's books, with expectations set high.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Book was a wonderful insight into those women who are trapped in relationships that drain the life out you literally and have no way out because they cannot escape even when they try. Book was very well written and would recommend to others.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|It is written so that the story is layered in mystery& revealed slowly, a juicy tidbit at a time. A fine read.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was one of the best books I've read in a while. Far better than the annoying teen drama that is so heavy circulated. I enjoyed the characters,how the plot unfolded to show how everything is connected.  It is also a long read for a great price. Couldn't put it down & it still took me days to finish!
B005D9MUWY|4.0|The accuracy and prediction scares me sometimes. The flow part works well but not as accurate as regular typing. This is the best typing app you will get.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|CROSSED was truly an amazing book! I loved how Ally Condie described everything in perfect detail. One aspect that really stood out to me was the amount of inspiration she added. There were many quotes that I loved and will always keep close to my heart. I felt like I was part of Cassia's world and was going  through all her adventures as well. I would recommend this book to teens and young adults. This story line and plot  really shows the true love Cassia and Ky have for each other. If you haven't already read CROSSED ..... read it! You will love it (just like I did)! I can't wait to read REACHED next!!!
B005GFPZYK|4.0|An interesting factual account of operations by special forces during the aftermath of the Iraq war. The author was also very honest about his attitudes and his personal life. I enjoyed it
B004D1CK32|5.0|No one can dispute the greatness of this film.  Of course Toshiro Mifune headlines here but to the man - all seven of them - the samurai are perfect.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|So good.<br />Totally worth reading.  Very thought provoking as a parent?<br />Can you always believe your child and support them
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I can't even put into words how much I love this show. It is a must watch. Can't wait for season 4!
0316212261|4.0|At first I didn't think I would finish the series. As I read on it seemed to draw you in and I did find it very funny in places. The hardest part about reading the series was getting used to some of the older english used. All in all it was very enjoyable read.
B004LZFWJO|4.0|I like this game, but I have my parents ADDICTED!! they now have to learn to take turns on the kindle.  LOL
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|The whole storyline was dijointed, awkward, depressing, and altogether not funny. Because we can never quit a movie, we kept going, thinking it would get better.....it didn't. Save your time and money and don't watch this movie.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Loved the characters!  I was drawn into the world by the sweet use of language, and felt that Dickens lurked in the background.  Any additional episodes or new works would draw me in.  These characters come to life after a few chapters, and would hold my interest for many more to follow.
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|I absolutely love this movie, watched it twice within 2 days of receiving it. It always puts me in a good mood.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I live this game it is so much fun. expecale when its to cold to ride my horse. I could plat this gamefor hours on end.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|Amazing work! Don't expect this to be the Broadway version...live theater is much different than the intimacy of film.<br />This soundtrack is raw and brave as it is recorded live during the performance on film.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I would recommend it because it is reliable and I can get world wide weather.I  use it a lot and like it.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|I love this.  The banter, give and take, is just great.  I enjoyed the tv season and am enjoying watching it again.
B00BGZ8OLA|4.0|I always love watching these kinds of shows and getting to watch it on my time is awesome.  Thanks alot.
B003L77FYS|5.0|I love this.  The banter, give and take, is just great.  I enjoyed the tv season and am enjoying watching it again.
B0058Z4NR8|4.0|The authors present a convincing theory of why some nations prosper when the underlying political institutions are inclusive as opposed to extraction.  The book helps complete the thought that Jarod Diamond's book started (Guns, Germs and Steel) about why certain societies are more prosperous than others due to having certain natural advantages.  But as Mr. Acemoglu posits that is not the only reason. To him the more important, long-term characteristic of prosperous nations is whether or not they have inclusive political and economic institutions as opposed to extractive institutions.<br /><br />The theory put forth is extremely convincing and, if true, then is actionable in how to design a better nation that outperforms other nations in terms of quality of life for its citizens.  The authors run through countless examples of how inclusive societies succeed and extractive ones fail and it is fascinating to read the reasons why.  While this is not an easy read, it is well worth reading for political science professors and students and history enthusiasts.<br /><br />Well done!
B0063M22QO|4.0|Love this game. Lot's of fun. I like the different formations. The pictures on the tiles are different from the original game.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|I've always loved Ben Stiller movies and this is an absolute classic.  There is a lot of humor that is silly and understated.  You will be quoting this one for years.  I already have been.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This is a very entertaining game. It has good puzzles and it is a lengthy game. G5 games are fun.
B000NY12CI|5.0|I wish I would have read this book before sharing the dais with her. Simply remarkable and inspiring! Ayaan is an angel among us.
B00687PWQG|5.0|This was the first time I used video on demand from Amazon, it was awesome.<br />The Video was very clear and well put together.<br />I loved the video series.
0062209493|5.0|I loved every moment, he's the real deal. I couldn't stop listening to it. Awesome can't wait till they make a movie of him.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|This temple run oz is the greatest temple run imangi studios had created. Its so AWESOME!! It has very good graphics, shocking suprises and much more. Theres a parachute that u can even ride on, and warp to different places by downloading them in the game. I recommend this game truly. Most people think that the old temple runs were simple and boring but this takes it to the next level!!!!
034547581X|5.0|Anyone interested in the viet nam war, how we fought it, why, and reasons why we did not win needs to read this. The people that did not great our soldiers as heros when they returned should be ashamed of themselves. It is spellbinding!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i love this game its so funn i love the way u can feed the horse care for the horse
B0071XO8RA|5.0|After seeing all of the reviews for this book I decided to try it.  I am so glad I did.  It didn't seem like something I would like but what caught my attention is someone said it was kind of along the lines of Hungar Games so I thought I would give it a try.  It is excellent and I couldn't stop reading it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best-selling fun way to get minecraft on the go! Some people say &quot;it's not as good as the computer edition.&quot; Witch I agree with them, but this is still a very fun and a very creative game, it is worth the 7 dollars.
B003SQVI54|5.0|If you haven't watched Cougar Town because of the title don't let that stop you.  The show changed course midway through the first season.  Though the first part of the season was funny it got even better as the chemistry between the cast began to come through.  It's a great show to watch and laugh for 20 minutes.  I'm a loyal fan now!
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|Really not enough to do and its kinda cheap and you get 1 token every 2 minutes. Yay. Entertaining and distracting for kids but not anything over 8.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I found almost every page of this to be provocative and informative.  I am a teacher in a public school; this serves as a way for introverts to argue for changes in schools to improve functionality for those who like the quiet.<br /><br />Too many schools are noisy places, designed for extroverts, and downright hostile to those who find over-stimulation a hindrance to learning.
B009AP2G26|3.0|Got carried away with the first three seasons.  I found this season not as interesting as the others.  Same old characters, same conflicts dragged out a little further.  Ever watch too much of something and suddenly you see through it and know what to expect?  That's how I felt about this season.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Brilliant action sequences, brilliant effects, brilliant acting within a great plot! This movie delivers on so many levels. Gone are the questionable safari suits of Moore and the cheesy cringe-worthy scenes of Moore, Dalton, Brosnan etc, and ridiculous gadgets from 'Q', we're back to the 'real' Bond. Very sorry to see our first female 'M' go, but the path has been established for Bond to get even better as we go forward. 2+ hours of fantastic entertainment, and of course the best Bond theme from delectable Adele since Goldfinger.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|The game is ok but the conversation allowed on the chat that cannot be turned off is totally unacceptable. Should be rated for adults only.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|I gave this app five stars because it is a good app.  I just don't like Sudoku.  I thought I would give it another shot since I got my Kindle Fire HD 8.9, but it's still just giving me that &#34;meh&#34; feeling.  I don't think it's fair to downgrade an app because I don't like the game.  If you love Sudoku, you'll enjoy this app.
B003K1EYM6|4.0|Able to use this with an external usb hub - then connect the usb cable from amplifier... now I can listen to music off iPad on high end spreakers!
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|We all love this app.  You can lose track of time when playing with this app.  My nine year old twins love this.
0441013597|5.0|Pete Blake<br />Ms. Miron<br />English 9-5<br />3-31-13<br /><br />If you haven't read Dune by: Frank Herbert already then you really should. This book has everything, fearless heroes, truly evil villains, and a story that will beg you to your knees it's so good. I agree with fellow reviewer  Daniel Dean in how he says that, \\"of all the people who have gotten past page 20- I don't know one who doesn't praise it among their absolute favorites.\\" (Dean) though I haven't done that, I would be willing to bet that anybody I might recommend this book to will love it. That is, they get past the first few pages.<br /><br />Every good story needs a truly kick-ass hero. Paul Atreides fulfills this. He was the fuel of the book, you feel every instance of terror, power, and weakness he feels. He ages from 15 to 17 and his growth is greatly shown as he goes from a naive boy to an all powerful emperor in the next book Dune Messiah, but that's for another time. \\"How little the universe knows about the nature of real cruelty!\\" (Herbert 740) These are Paul's thoughts after he gets the message that his son has been killed and that his sister, Alia, has been captured, he does not break down, he only thinks of how existence doesn't know cruelty. Paul prevails even through the hardships of being thrown into the deep desert with his pregnant mother, after his father, the Duke, has been killed. Even when he is thrown into a coma following his drinking of the water of life. Even when the evil son of the Baron has him pinned, he prevails.<br /><br />Kick-ass heroes are only half the battle, no good story is really complete until the villain is as complete as the hero. Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, Feyd-Rautha, Gaius Helen Mohiam, Emperor Shaddam IV, you could argue Paul himself. Every villain has a goal, whether it is to get rid of their rivals or battling themselves in hope to get rid of the oracular vision of a Jihad in their name. Basically the way these villains get defeated is as such: TheBaron gets killed by Alia, Shaddam gets exiled to his prison planet, Feyd gets killed by Paul, and Gaius Helen Mohiam and Paul get defeated by.. well you'll have to read the next book. All in all, every villain is utterly conquered.<br /><br />The story of  Dune is what really hits home for me. Politics, mysticism, religion, environmentalism all add up for an amazing story. Believe it or not Dune is a science-fiction story, but even if you don't like the genre, you'll like the book. The story of Dune is somewhat simple, House Atreides is offered the planet Arrakis, or Dune as it's more popularly hailed, by their rivals House Harkonnen. Arrakis is a vital part of the economic growth of the universe, producing an exclusive spice called Melange (which is similar to oil in our society.) House Atreides' Duke, Leto, knows of a trap House Harkonnen has set, a traitor among the Atreides house, and multiple trinkets hidden around the Arrakeen keep to kill the Atreides. The Dukes son, Paul Atreides, is said to be the famed Kwisatz Haderach. The Bene Gesserit sisterhood leap at the opportunity to win over this great gene line. The story is one of epic proportions, it takes time and an attentive mind to conquer this magnificent book.<br /><br />My favorite character in Dune is, surprise surprise, Paul Atreides. I liked this character because he was just a very well thought out character and he has stunning growth and shows his strength and defeat in the calmest of manners. He is also very relatable as he is my age (15) but he is also very distant because, lets face it, the guy is a messiah. Overall he is just a great character.<br /><br />\\"I must not fear.<br />Fear is the mind-killer.<br />Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.<br />I will face my fear.<br />I will permit it to pass over me and through me.<br />And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.<br />Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.<br />Only I will remain.\\" (Herbert 12)<br /><br />This quote is the litany against fear and is a commonly thought thing in Dune. I particularly like this quote because of the impact it has had on me, that sounds silly now but once you think this in situations, you'll understand.<br /><br />(i had to do this for english class, i apologize)
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Dis da best game Eva for kindle fira<br />You should really buy this game. It's fun and should keep your kids busy for 3 hours. I Know this because I have a brother.
B004VYYA2K|5.0|She uses it a lot.  Holds a lot of her barbie doll stuff and the zipper is quite nice.  seems pretty sturdy
B00910Y1OQ|1.0|The App Store shows this as being discounted to 99 cents today and shows it as &#34;premium&#34;. What it is not up front about is that it is not the whole game, only one level of the game. When you finish that level, it wants you to purchase the rest of the game. This is the same thing that happened awhile back when it was listed as &#34;free&#34;.<br /><br />I believe this is misleading to the buyer. If a game is listed as &#34;free&#34; or discounted, it should be the whole game OR a codicil should be included in the photo/title so one knows right away it is only a sample.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|Whether or not you are a civil war buff, you will enjoy this movie.  A look into the portrayal of national politics during that period is fascinating.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I really did enjoy the book. Except for the very last page. I truly hate stupid endings and in my opinion that was just beyond stupid. Ugh.
B008LG6SXS|1.0|Was excited to try this app because of all the traveling I do.  Unfortunately after having the app for several days now it still has yet to work. Everytime I open the app and try a search it closes down and I get an error message that says &quot;Unfortunately Booking.com has stopped working&quot;.  Tried with wi_fi, with LTE, and no difference. Will give a couple of more days to see if update can fix. If so will change my review. If not will uninstall.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I'm so glad I waited to read this book!!! Cuz if I would have had to wait for sequel I would have went crazy.  Now will get walking disaster at midnight. One of my favorite books.  Fell in love with Travis on page 72 lol. This will b one of the books on my kindle I will read again.
