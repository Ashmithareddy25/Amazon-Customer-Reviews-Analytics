B003P2WO5E|5.0|Clearly one of the best book written ever. Brandon Sanderson's best so far I believe, it really leaves you with more questions than answers and this is not easy for a 1000 page book. When is the next one coming out? this is starting to feel like the Wheel of Time anticipation...
0802473156|5.0|I highly recomemded to read...it is great from everyone, whether your married, single, divorce or widow...it help you with everyone who comes into your life...work, family, or even someone you don't know...take the time to discover each others love language & make their day :)
B0050X1OQ6|5.0|Memory works fine what can you say about it, price is right and it is easy to install. Good buy.
0761171703|4.0|Got this book for my daughter's 6th birthday, but I think I'll hold on to it for a couple of years. The photos are categorized according to everyday occurrences (dreaming, loving, playing, etc...). There are some photos that I don't want to have to explain/expose my daughter to quite yet. (One really innocent photo in \\"loving\\" is called \\"Sexting,\\" \\"Skinny Dip\\" is a naked woman leaping--all that's really visible are her buttocks, it's not a frontal shot--the subtitle page of \\"Living\\" has a man in the shower with a clear shower curtain--again, not full frontal.) The photographs and poses are stunning, however. I love the descriptions and back stories in the last couple of pages. It's incredible what these talented people have trained their bodies to do.
0812993845|3.0|I came very close to giving up on this book.  In the first 3rd of the book I just found no sympathy for any of the characters.  Lottie was way too over-dramatic and Fliss was just ok.  I willed myself to keep reading and I am glad that I did.  I found myself laughing and enjoying all the nuttiness.  It was a little over-the-top, but if you have read other Sophie Kinsella books (Shopaholic series), then you can expect that from her books.<br /><br />I did not love any of the characters.  Lottie is a little dingy and almost unbelievable with her outrageous antics.  Fliss is close to the same, but not so dingy.  None of the men make that much of an impression.  I didn't find myself hoping for anyone to get together.  I did find myself hoping they would all wise up, though.<br /><br />Overall, it is a light read that is laugh-out-loud funny.  I didn't love it, but it was an okay read.  Could I be more vague?  I guess I just felt middle of the road about it.  I wouldn't be jumping up and down to recommend it to anyone, but I wouldn't tell anyone not to read it either.
B000025APX|4.0|Great early release from Amon Amarth, this band def swings the mightiest war hammer there is! No doubt the production and song writing has much improved with their later releases, this is just authentic Viking metal at it's best. I like this better than the first release and The Crusher, although Masters of War (on the Crusher cd) is the most brutal war metal tune ever written!!! There are no super stand out tunes on Avenger but if you like the feeling of hammers and axes smashing shields and bone, this will get the job done!
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I purchased this as a gift for my son and he loved it and is a big Harry Potter fan and a collector.
B007REV4YI|5.0|If you are a James Bond fan....WOW, you're going to enjoy this disc!<br />Blu Ray is the frosting on this awesome cake.  The soundtrack is first rate,<br />and Adele....is simply amazing.<br />  I had a problem with the disc freezing during layer change, found a bubble in the metallization near the edge<br />  of the disc.  It occurred with 2 different players, too.  Contacted Amazon, and they quickly provided the means<br />  to exchange it....what a class-act!  The new disc works like a champ!
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|great game other than loss of game when you sign off and come on again.  when it happens you cannot always get it back and need to start over.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|My originally bought the DVD...it's OK, the lower resolution was very evident on<br />certain scenes, where jaggies were visible on a 42 inch screen.  The blu ray cured<br />all that, and audio seems much clearer too ( I don't know if there is technical backing<br />to this observation ).  Adele sings her heart out in this concert, and I have enjoyed<br />playing this disc at least a half dozen times already....a real keeper!<br />What an amazing artist.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Flynn has done it again.  Excellent. I hate finishing a book because it's torture having to wait for the next book.
B0017CW5J4|5.0|I'm a concert video fan, and this Blue Man Group blu ray is simply a gem, and makes<br />my home theater come alive!  My wife and I saw the Blue Man at the Venetian a couple of<br />years ago, and it was a meld of this performance, with some in the \\"extras\\" section.<br />That performance was amazing....the visuals were stunning, and the audio sensations were<br />first rate..loud, dynamic, and oh so clean.<br /> This is a great disc to add to your concert collection!
0812993845|1.0|Although I continue to love the Shopaholic series, I think I'm aging out of the stand-alone Kinsella books.  Too madap and over-the-top, which I understand is what to expect in a Kinsella book (which leads me back to it no longer being for me).  I gave up about halfway through - I think I was more frustrated than Lottie and Ben.
B0013FBS20|4.0|Despite the glaring differences from the graphic novel (for those that have read it) this was a solid movie.  Will Smith does a great job in this film.
B007H1HQW0|2.0|doesn't work as well as it should... plus the box said it included up to 8 sanders and there was only one piece of SMALL sanding paper in the box
B003IY48PS|4.0|I bought this before seeing the remake.  It had been a while since I had seen the original and wanted to add it to the collection.  This is a classic film that any horror fan must see.
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|This is one of the greatest movies ever - everytime this movie has been on tv I always watch it. Now it is in my library of videos.
B005J9ZE5I|4.0|This is a great series that any horror fan needs to add to their collection.  Bruce Campbell is genious as Ash.  Anyone that hasn't seen these will not be disappointed.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love Ice Age Village. Great for passing time on a tablet. And you can't beat free for a price tag. :)
B009AMAGXK|5.0|I don't know why ppl hated it I thought it was pretty good It could of been longer but I guess every1 have the right to there own opinions and I respect that I just wished they would have given it A chance now there won't be a Second movie because it did poorly at the box office.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun addictive and fast game play. I really enjoy it especially as a quick game when I have just a minute to kill while waiting for something.
B003M70O5O|4.0|The first season draws you in. Good cast and good acting. Decent story and pretty good plot. Some of the scenarios and actions are completely unrealistic though. Had to knock of a start for some ridiculous and unrealistic scenarios. I do like the show for many reasons, including the plot twists.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love the show and the fact that I could instantly download it to my device.  I will definitely use this again in the future.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't put this book down- although I thought it would be horrible and mushy. It was unexpected that the book held my attention.

B005K17RU0|5.0|Works very well on Kindle HD. I agree with many of the other reviews. I'm adding this review to rate this app.
B007R726EC|5.0|This is an awesome read, but you have to read in small doses and then think about what you read, then go back and reread to make it sink in.<br />Very good, not an easy read, but powerful!
B0038YWPZS|5.0|Who doesn't like this movie?  It is pure entertainment.  I don't know of anyone who has not seen this movie, but it is a must have classic.

B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This book revived memories of some of my childhood favorites. It has an enveloping atmosphere that takes into mind-space where the mysterious is what you breath and inhabit. I thought it was great.
B005OK721G|5.0|This movie was used but in good condition and plays good. It is a action movie so if you like action this gal in this movie really kicks ass.
B000EHSN9Y|5.0|NO problems here.  Nice modern touch on colored ends. With DVI cord, I was able to connect a mid-2007 iMac to a Samsung Syncmaster 941 BW monitor.
B0094K1QR8|3.0|This was a pretty good movie. It was cute, not great but ok. A nice rainy day kind of movie.

B001OY5X2Q|5.0|I purchased this for my husband and I. My husband introduced me to Siouxsie & the Banshees 16 years ago, he's been a fan since he was a child. I would recommend this CD to anyone.
B008476HBM|5.0|no issues with this addition. i enjoyed the book and even purchased a hard cover to have a nice physical representation of my read (thats how i roll)
0786956291|3.0|My son wanted to learn to play Dungeons and Dragons so I bought this for him. The instructions were very confusing but eventually after doing some research and looking on youtube we are learning. I've had to buy him the monster manuals as well because you can only do so much with this, it's only a starter kit. This is an expensive game to get into.
B004OSPTSM|5.0|Book is solid, looks good, nice bookmark string, shipped timely. Nothing wrong with this product and I have enjoyed the read.
0465043577|5.0|This was an interesting perspective from Mandelbrot about the inept models already used in the financial industry. I would love to find time to try these new ideas out in my models.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Does exactly what it needs to do, easy to use.  Why this functionality isn't built into the OS is beyond me, but this app fills the void nicely.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Mystery Manor so far is way better than most mystery games I've played. I hope it gets better as I play further
B004KKXMSI|3.0|My kids absolutely loved these movies, but if I didn't know they were blue-ray I never would have guessed as they are very grainy in comparison to other blu-ray movies we own.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved the book...held my interest....craved reading it.  Written so well that I had a picture of everything in my mind.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|This was one of th  best books I have ever read after all in a smart kid. Amazing five hundred stars
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is fun and as challenging as you want it to be,  easy to maneuver and lots of playing<br /> options.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It is a great book for kids of all ages. I loved reading it and seeing Greg in another adventure
B004G600A4|5.0|We really enjoy family movie nights and this movie has had several good showings as it's my daughters favorite princess movies. We all really enjoyed this one.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a long time! You will definitely laugh, cry, and root for Pat.
B00AYHKIZ6|4.0|Been a long time coming.  Musically a bit like Reality.  Lyrically, Bowie is obviously thinking more about old age and reflecting on what has or could have happened in his life. Definitely worth a listen.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I got this for my Kindle fire and it works so well. But it takes tons of space.but it is still the best game ever.it would be nice if it could be updated to 0.7.1 but I can't do anything about that I just hope Amazon gets or drift that we WANT THE STUPID UPDATE.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is addictive and should be as popular as temple run. I think  you should buy it.Got to go play it more. Do me a favor and buy it.
0307744434|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read in a long time. Magical, romantic, intriguing, unusual, mysterious... my list of adjectives could go on and on. It was engrossing and engaging from the very first page, and the style of writing just kept me turning page after page hungrily. This was reminiscent of so many other authors' works, and yet I can't mention any because it still remained a masterpiece all its own with a style all its own.<br /><br />I truly believe that there are enough facets to this novel to entertain almost any sort of reader: the romantic reader, the supernatural dreamer, the fantasy fan, the action buff, the thrill seeker... there's something for everyone in this book and it's definitely a new favorite of mine.
B000067J1H|5.0|One of the best movies of all time! I love how it keeps you guessing until the very end of what going to happen. Brad Pitt does a great job and really gets into character. I love this movie now as much as I did the first time I saw it.
B0014Z4OQG|3.0|Cloverield is a mixed bag. I enjoyed the film, but there are problems that I had and that others might have with the film. Cloverfield is another attempt by America to do our own original monster movie. This time they used the found footage format to make it their own. Comaped to other American monster movies, I'd say that this is my favorite. Though, as I said the film has problems.<br /><br />One complaint I have is the found footage format. I like that they tried a different appraoch to making a monster movie, but it did not work for me. The camera was too shaky and did not focus on a shot long enough for the viewer to completely take in what was happening. Though I could buy it in the beginning, as the film went on, I found it hard to believe that they would not drop the camera.<br /><br />Another problem is the characters. I did not find them annoying, but I thought they were bland. I did not find one of them interesting. So when they died, I did not care.<br /><br />The effects were good. I thought that the design of the monster was cool and looked very original. There was a ton of hype surrounding this film when the teaser first came out. People were wondering what this thing was that was destoying New York City. So some were probably let down by the fact that it was a monster. I did not get into the hype so I was okay with it. This film also had a great atmosphere to it as well.<br /><br />Overall, I did enjoy this film. However, it is not for everyone.
0547884591|5.0|This is a great book. I really like Tim Ferriss's work and this book is awesome. It's really complete about learning thing quickly
B002HWRYJE|5.0|This film made me a fan of Star Trek. Star Trek had been dead for years. The last StarTrek movie before this was bashed by critics and fans alike. After that Star Trek fadded out for a while. Then J.J. Abrams rebooted it and gave it a new life. I'd say that it really paid off. Unlike the old Star Trek this film draws in a more broad following. This new Star Trek not only appeals to long die hard fans of the franchise, but to newcommers, like me. I was not a fan of the old Star Trek. However, I saw this and became a fan of the franchise.<br /><br />The characters were solid. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto do solid jobs as Kirk and Spock. The other actors do a fine job also. I like the cameo by Leonard Nemoy. I do wish they would have gotten William Shatner to make a cameo also, though. Though I thought that Uhura was unneeded. It seems like she was just there for sex appeal and for forced drama.<br /><br />The effects are amazing. This film looks a lot like a Star Wars film. The film looks this way because J.J. Abrams worked on this film because he could not work on Star Wars, which is his dream. Some people might be turned off by this, but I did not mind the look. The story is also very competant. Some twists occured that I did not see coming.<br /><br />Overall for die hard Star Trek fans this is a must see. Also, for people wanting to get into the franchise I'd say this is a good place to start out.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|First of all, it was made by one of the greats, Tina Fey. This book explains her whole life, from when she was a child to now. This book also tells stories about her life in very detailed ways.(maybe that's because she wrote it!) It is absolutely astonishing and is one of the best biographies there is. It has serious stories that she makes funny and it talks about Sarah Palin, if you were wondering. Buy this book! Everyone around you as you read will look at you funny because you will laugh hysterically at Tina's jokes!
B004EPYZPS|4.0|Super 8 gives me feelings of the nostalgia.  When I watch this film, I'm reminded of when I was a kid watching the Goonies.  Super 8 was obvioulsly J.J. Abrams' omage to films like the Goonies.  Personally, I think he did a good job.  I liked this film just as much as the Goonies.  The characters were mostly likable and funny (mainly the kids).  The plot is interesting.  There is this feeling of mystery and adventure, like the Goonies had.<br /><br />There were some minor problems.  Many of the adult chracters I did not care for.  The design of the alien was not that great.  Plus there was one thing that happened in the movie that made absolutely no sense.<br /><br />Overall, anyone who's a fan of the Goonies or Scifi films, check this out!
B004I2K4E8|5.0|My wife and I have seen this musical performed live in New York, San Francisco and in London.  We had recently seen the latest movie version.  This DVD performance has a great cast, and many of the original Broadway artists at the end so it was very special to watch and also just listen too.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this particular version.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|ALL I CAN SAY IS I COULD NOT PUT THIS BOOK DOWN I READ ALL THREE IN ONE WEEK... ENOUGH SAID
B008NW67E0|5.0|......most of the songs just make me ant to dance! And I do.......love their voices, harmonies, and lyrics. also bought their 1st CD, and love it, too.....
B008XG1X18|5.0|Wow, I LOVE Pinterest! It's a great app, and the site is great too! I love being able to organize things, and I've learned TONS of awesome things! Highly reccomend anyone (but I think Moms and people looking to plan Weddings, baby showers, etc. will enjoy it most) and have fun pinning!
B000I5SY9Q|5.0|Love the themes, love Faye Dunaway.  This movie is more relevant in 2013 than it was when they made it in the 1970's.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|If the sexiness and language can be tolerated, the story line is remarkable.  One read through is not enough to realize this existing sickness/shades.  This goes for the entire trilogy, I'm not going to take the time to enter it three times.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|Mesmerizing computer animation created beautifully outside what your imagination might even expect!  A FEAST for the eyes and completely compelling love story between two and to which tribe they may belong.  Excellent for &#34;date night&#34;!
B0066WJLU6|5.0|I always have a flashlight with me and I use this app frequently!  It is very convenient and I don't have to worry about having batteries on hand- as long as my phone is charged!
0345803485|4.0|Good read, sometimes a little slow. Didn't think the story lived up to all the hype that I had previously heard about after reading all three books. Delivery time was prompt.
B005LHOKFS|4.0|I just got this but on my vacation in Florida the past 3 wweeks I have made extensive use of it.
B001GXTXTO|5.0|This is also the reason I still listen to them, good old school style and just good beats. Own it.

0385495323|4.0|From describing very descriptive ancient codes to the fascinating world of quantum computing this author touches on it all with very well illustrated examples to help clarify a very difficult and highly complex subject of cryptanalysis--- with its modern employment of linguists, mathematicians, and computer engineers.  It's an ongoing quest to keep our PRIVACY from intrusions of all sources such as governments, business competitors, or prying eyes. There are many privacy issues that both governments and private citizens alike must face in today's technological world. These questions are posed and answered in many ways within the book. One caveat---recalling what our esteemed Statesman Benjamin Franklin once expressed---\\"Any one who will trade freedom for security deserves neither\\" The quandary is how government protects its citizens from acts of terror or how citizens may be protected by a tyrannical government--read this book<br /><br />Simon Singh has produced a manuscript that not only gives one a deeper insight into the world of cryptanalysis from a historical prospective but also the men and women involved in this complex field of science through out the ages,----the brilliant people from various and varied walks of life who have contributed immensely to this science past and present . It covers the humanist aspect from those involved with their various idiosyncrasies of behavior from the selling of data to foreign powers as well as personal behavior that could cause one to be blackmailed by enemies. This book is a can of worms in many respects since it opens up to the reader a world fraught with possible invasion of privacy -one of the most fundamental rights we should all hold dear--especially in America--and what avenues we have at our disposal to solve these dilemmas.<br /><br />The writing style Simon uses to explain the complex theories and problems that code breakers or code makers must use is exemplary and easily understood for the average layman--although he helps to have some advanced understanding of the sciences ---but it is not necessary in comprehending what the author conveys in this book.<br /><br />I found the Appendix in the rear especially helpful in my study of the very basic science of cryptanalysis as well as his simple examples on how it all pieces together to form the whole picture.<br /><br />Even though this book was written in 1999--- for those of us who are concerned about CURRENT EVENTS in this science the last chapter offers deeper insights and may be used as a springboard to investigate further developments of cryptanalysis and how we may apply it to our everyday life of sending emails, buying merchandize or researching various subjects. While the wide world of the internet has opened our vast horizons to knowledge and communications within a multitude of domains ---rest assure there is an army of cryptanalyst struggling to keep our messages and correspondence secure daily---or at least we HOPE THERE IS--or we may involve ourselves with political action to ensure our freedom of privacy?ugh he helps to have some advanced understanding of the sciences ---but it is not necessary in comprehending what the author conveys in this book.<br /><br />I found the Appendix in the rear especially helpful in my study of the very basic science of cryptanalysis as well as his simple examples on how it all pieces together to form the whole picture.<br /><br />Even though this book was written in 1999--- for those of us who are concerned about CURRENT EVENTS in this science the last chapter offers deeper insights and may be used as a springboard to investigate further developments of cryptanalysis and how we may apply it to our everyday life of sending emails, buying merchandize or researching various subjects.

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Great book after i got into it i just could nit take my eyes off great written expressions and feeling!!!
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Great book to relive the 20th century. With its wars and social changes. Captivating writing weaves the stories of three families into an overview of the time period before and after.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|i recommended it to my son but found out i have a weird sound on my kindle which he has the real sound on his tablet. fun game to play, time can get away from you so i set a timer.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|I ordered for my wife and she loves it. It has been the only thing playing in the car since she got it, and it works for me too.  He has a unique mellow sound that keeps her lead foot calmer...
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|What a great ride! I'm a voracious reader and this provided every ounce of entertainment I search for in a book. The characters were realistic and relatable, they weaved together flawlessly. The story line was nice and had a great flow--it kept me reading when I knew I should shut the light and go to sleep. The banter between the characters was highly entertaining and the relationship between the prince and the damsel has just enough angst throughout the story to keep you guessing whether its going to be a happy ending or break your heart. And I must say, I am a writer and have pinned several novels myself and I give major compliments to her writing; it's quirky, entertaining and just downright charming. It's a great book to get lost in and live some passion through someone's eyes.<br /><br />Stop reading the reviews and just buy the book already-- you won't be sorry!
0385349947|5.0|I have been working in the gender specific leadership (as co-author of &#34;Dancing on the Glass Ceiling) arena for over 15 years. Sheryl has brought this dialogue to the forefront and moved it forward. Did I ever think that this issue would still be relevant--and need to be. No way. Thanks Sheryl.
B002O3Z4Y8|5.0|I have had this movie for years but not as a DVD.  It's the truth about delinquint homes for boys (and probably girls) and the abuse and molestation they endure every day of their lives by guards who are cruel, vicious and pedophile pigs.  Very well done with an actual plot.
B008YKGQR4|4.0|I like it to still keep it. the closest to fb, would like to play more fb games with my kindle fire hd.
B00BAYLQI0|5.0|Absolutely wonderful movie which is a surprise with the terrible movies being released these days for the teens and the slaughter and zombie lovers.  I would recommend it to anyone with a heart and it is not a &#34;chick flick&#34;.  Amazing acting from the children and especially Naomi Watts.  Well done.
B009AMANBA|1.0|I was so looking forward to this movie. Couldn't miss. My favorite actor (Daniel Day Lewis) My favorite director (Spielberg) My favorite historical figure (Lincoln). Movie was a total sleeper. Lewis was very good, always is. The movie was all about politics. not so much about Lincoln himself. Lincoln making deals and compromising to get votes for the passing of the 13th amendment.The entire movie was devoted to the passing of an amendment and the process of how it was done. Just very boring. The only reason I gave it one star is Lewis.
B00003CXA6|4.0|This is a good movie about the Civil War and went into great detail so is great for you history buffs!  Would recommend if you like these stories. A+++
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|I've heard a lot of hubbub about this book and this series from friends and other fans of the paranormal/supernatural genre so I decided to give it a shot. The verdict? For me, good but not great. If you're on the teetering point of deciding whether or not to plunk down the $5.99 for the novel on the Kindle, you might want to take a peek at my reasoning.<br /><br />The Good:<br />1) Entertaining characters. For the most part, I enjoyed spending time with these characters and that's sometimes rare in this genre. Often times, you get the Bella Swans (selfish Emo Pseudo-Goth Mary Sues) or the Anita Blakes (overconfident sexist tomboy bitches) but Clary is neither of these stereotypes and that's a relief. There is a nice spread of different personalities represented here and that's definitely a plus for readers like me who go for character over plot to keep them involved in a story.<br />2) Interesting world. The quirks and rules and intricacies of the Shadowhunters' world is engrossing, especially if you're a Harry Potter fan. Not to say this is as good as Rowling's work but the level of detail included smacks of Mr. Potter in a very good way.<br />3) Great dialogue. This is by far the book's strongest point aside from the language itself. Jace is the standout character because he has at least a dozen lines that made me stop reading and actually laugh for a few seconds. Simon also has some great moments. The humor is spot on and very refreshing without coming across as pretentious or like it's trying too hard.<br />4) Beautiful language. Nothing flowery or purple prose-y, either. Just a great vocabulary and some excellent imagery.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />1) Clary has the personality of wheat toast. Healthy, but bland, forgettable, and sometimes hard to swallow. Now, granted, she is by no means the worst female protagonist I've ever read but I read the entire novel less than a week ago and I cannot tell you much about her despite the fact that this novel is told from her perspective. She leaves little to no impression on me at all. She's beige. She's oatmeal with no raisins or sugar. She's just...sorta there. And that's disheartening considering the novel is pretty good overall.<br />2) Clary is not an active protagonist (in my opinion). 99% of what happens in this story happens TO Clary, not BECAUSE of Clary. Granted, I'm a writer and it may just be a personal pet peeve, but if you are the main character, you need to be motivating, creating, advancing, and kickstarting the plot. I understand that because Clary is being introduced to this world, she has to ride shotgun but even until the very end, everything is happening to her. She is barely the cause of anything and she never takes the reins on her own life. Now, this may be building up to her taking charge in future novels, but that's not good enough. In the first book, I have to feel like this is Clary's story and her life and her world. I didn't get that feeling. This felt like Jace's world and Jace's story. It would be different if I think the author intended it to be that way, like say how ABC's Castle is called Castle but it's really about Detective Kate Beckett, but I think that was accidental. The book really does suffer from the fact that Clary is pretty much just 100 lbs of dead weight from start to finish.<br />3) Simon gets the shaft. A LOT. I enjoyed Jace but he's a tool and he knows it and we know it and yet Simon still gets treated like crap from beginning to end even though he really doesn't deserve it. His only real crime is being a passive aggressive teenage boy who doesn't know how to admit to his feelings. He gets screwed consistently and it's kind of hard to read if you're not a fan of Jace. Maybe that's realistic because often nice guys (and girls, as I can attest to) finish last but it made me like the story less because he kept getting treated badly for no real rhyme or reason.<br />4) The ending. I rarely like twist endings unless they're done well. This one...not so much. I didn't like the big character reveal because it made me feel dirty and uncomfortable. I won't spoil it but if you don't like the rug being pulled out from under you when it comes to a couple, then you might not be all too happy with this ending. It makes me feel like I invested time into a relationship that is later torn asunder. I don't like being manipulated, especially if it doesn't have a set purpose.<br />5) Too much exposition/info-dumping. The detail of the Shadowhunters' world is both a gift and a curse of the book. On the one hand, it's really interesting. On the other hand, about 60% of the book is just characters explaining stuff to Clary and it really, really slows down the pacing to a drag in several spots.<br /><br />Overall, there is a reason this series is widely liked and I think the novel is good, but there just wasn't enough to bring me back for more. It is indeed worth a read but your mileage may vary based on your tastes in relation to compelling love interests and protagonists. That being said, I would never tell anyone not to read it. Solid book, but it could have been incredible.
B009LGO88E|5.0|It works exactly like I hope it would. I love the added bonus of me no longer accidentally popping the game out when its in suspended mode.
0786956291|5.0|I have not ever played D&D properly before. As I flipped through this package it became clear what I had been missing and not only was it so easy to follow and set up player characters but my fiance even got into the action and rolled her own character.<br /><br />We have been having a lot of fun exploring the realm of D&D and this set which we snagged for under 15 dollars was well worth it for anyone just getting into the game it is a perfect set. I would recommend buying a few figures to add to the Player Characters imagination but other then that this box is ready to go for anyone interested in D&D

B003TSEEDY|5.0|I just finished reading this beautiful book and I plan to read it again. I loved Charlie's insight and perspective. I was very moved by this book and it has become one of my favorites.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I wish i could revert right now my kindle app to its previous upgrade on my tablet.  The new one entered and it basically has rendered the app non functional.  Doesn't sync with my kindle phone app, keeps crashing, it is that bad.<br /><br />I expect it to be fixed ASAP - because it has made the reading experience a nightmare on my tablet.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|Bought this case with my new Kindle Fire and it fits perfectly. I also love its sturdy construction. Highly recommended!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter love this game she plays it for hours a day I love the fact that it is a safe game
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|The case was cracked when I recevied the CD, but the CD was not damaged.  The CD was great. Thanks!
B00775D77Y|5.0|Everything 1980s Brit music is generally not - deep, thought-provoking, musically stimulating... this album is the transition point for Talk Talk from promising synth band to a true musical original.  Talk Talk's two remaining albums owe much to the work here.
B007R11DKQ|5.0|This movie is unique in a refreshingly good way.  The actors were very well cast, and the story itself is beyond phenomenal.  Not to mention, the effects are nearly flawless and do not look cheesy in the least.  Admittedly, some of the dialogue can be a little corny, but it is minimal.<br /><br />This movie gets quite a bit of love from me on its originality and amazing quality.  I can say, by far, that this is my number one favorite movie of all time and it literally has been since its release.  I cannot say enough good about it.  It is one of very few movies that I could watch over and over again without getting tired of it or bored to death.  It combines fantasy with a small modern-ish twist, tells an engaging story, and even teaches some pretty unexpected lessons.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with a great movie like this - and it's great for families, too.
1476734941|5.0|Not having any information other than TV, and other reviews, I went ahead and ordered the book.  I found it to be a helpful guideline, and enjoyed reading both authors' perspectives.
B001AQQR2S|5.0|Here's a cute story of how a little girl overcame ignorance and negligence in her home. A fun dose of magic and love. This movie is one of my childhood favorites.

B001GCUO5M|5.0|...the movie was suspenseful, & I was utterly surprised... As a matter of fact, I'm gonna re-watch this movie this weekend.  Like this almost as much as &#34;Inception&#34;.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|My wife and I missed out on all the fun but heard about the storyline. She watched one eposode on PBS and decided she wanted to see the series from the begining. We got the series and after one episode in the first year we both were hooked. The acting and production and attention to detail so vastly beats ANYTHING on American TV. I don't know if I want to watch season 4 as it unfolds or not pay attention to the broadcasts and purchase the new season when it comes out.
B002ZG980U|5.0|...rivals The Matrix (another one of my all-time favorites).  I couldn't stop note-taking to this movie, because it goes right up the psychology ladder, with it's in-depth analysis of experiences of the dream-world (Freud would be jealous).  Plus, DiCaprio & cast really provide a great entertaining experience.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Fall of the Giants was the first and this one continues the story.<br />Historical but very informative.<br /><br />He is a great story teller and really holds your interest.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Excellent movie.  Very entertaining and the cast was super.  Amazed with the makeup for both lead stars.  Well worth the price and we have already watched it twice, even after going to see it a the movie theater.
B002ZG98UA|5.0|Milla rocks it hard again and is a sexy zombie killing b**ch! Woo! 5 Stars for being a good movie.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|The story by an older adult of his journey at an early age; the trials, life threatening adventure was great.  Ang Lee did a great job directing this picture.  It is a welcomed addition to our movie collection.

B002BCNK1Q|5.0|Clint Eastwood's film career may be grossly oversimplified into three periods: the Spaghetti Western period, the Dirty Harry period, and the Tom Highway period.<br /><br />Tom Highway was an aging Marine gunnery sergeant in 1986's Heartbreak Ridge.  Highway struggled to connect with the young recruits in his platoon and the modern world around him.  Basically every Eastwood character in every subsequent Eastwood movie has been cut from that same cloth.  There have been some memorable ones, such as William Muny (1992's Unforgiven) and Frankie Dunn (2004's Million Dollar Baby).<br /><br />Practice makes perfect.<br /><br />Walt Kowalski transforms from a bitter old man who hates his neighbors for no reason, to a compassionate man willing to sacrifice almost anything for those same neighbors.  Other characters have similar journeys.  A young priest who cowers behind the pulpit spouting platitudes becomes the spiritual leader God has called him to be.  A rudderless young man finds direction behind the wheel of a 1972 Gran Torino, while Lake Michigan aptly hovers in the background.<br /><br />A salient feature of a classic film is that the movie does not get worse after multiple viewings.  You still laugh at the funny parts and cry during the sad parts.  Gran Torino is a classic.
1603425381|5.0|If you crochet anything, this book is a must!  So many times in the past I have made something and searched for a good border to use for it, and now I won't have to look any further than this lovely book! Now the only problem I will have is trying to pick out which border I want to use - the selection is mind boggling, to say the least.  Great book, I love it!
6305120706|5.0|This item came in excellent condition with all the original packaging.  It is wonderful and, I am happy to own it.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|The Selection series has been a breathe of fresh air, a place to share secrets, act out, eat good food and kiss a prince. The writing of these books has the power to simply take you there, quite literally. I love experiencing the exciting romance, compassion and even the downfalls that America beholds in this book of whirlwinds, twists and turns. If you are a hopeless romantic or someone in need of wholesome fun, I totally recommend this book as well as the first one The Selection.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Good game for the cost.  Haven't failed a level yet. Starting on the timed games now.  Should get harder as the game progresses.
B0068RHGJM|5.0|I have ALL the Nightwish albums and love both Tarja and Annette's voices. That being said, this album has taken their songwriting to a new incredible level. The amount of hard effort and detail that went into their song composing is mind-busting. The song melodies are much more complex and intricate than in their past albums (Songs like Rest Calm, I Want My Tears Back, and Last Ride of the Day really showcase this). The Crow, the Owl, and the Dove is heart-wrenchingly beautiful, the album's single Storytime is slammin' and Ghost River is the perfect blend between catchy and gothic. I could go on and on, but this is truly an amazing album! I would say it's Nightwish's best album however I still hold Once up in the highest regard. However, this album is only a half-step from being the new Once! GET IT!!
0425263908|4.0|When I first started reading I had to double check the title to make sure I wasn't reading 50 Shades. There are a lot of similarities in the book, but there are some differences as well. What's the same...<br />Well, both Eva & Ana literally fell for their men. Both men are very rich and have a way of gathering information on their ladies without their permission. Christian & Gideon both have dominant and possessive qualities about them, but Gideon's is a bit more accepting and consensual between lovers. Ana and Eva are both just out of college, although Eva's man didn't buy the company after she started working. He already owned it. Both women have issues with their mother and both men have some mental issues they need to work on.<br /><br />Now the differences...<br />Eva has her own mental issues to deal with and her family has money, where Ana needed to work. Gideon wasn't adopted like Christian, but after his father committed suicide, his mother remarried and he has a step-brother he's not too fond of. There are a lot less questions concerning what Eva will or will not do in the bedroom. Eva has a lot of insecurities and the smallest things seem to send her running(which is her M.O.)<br /><br />Overall, I couldn't put the book down. I wanted to know more. Their sexual encounters were frequent, intense and powerful. I didn't like how often the \\"c\\" word was used, but other than that, I'm ready for book 2.
B001CTGQBK|4.0|Had no time to watch it in itd entirty<br />sorry my fault maybe will try again cause it seems like a good movie.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I love the next board is more challenging each time.  Very clear playing board.  Plenty of options for the novice or expert!
0545123275|5.0|I absolutely love this book. I've read it about three times now and I still am swayed by the characters. There are people who say this is boring and expect something to happen. I did not feel that way because I enjoyed the characters in the book. I think this is a book is for someone who loves romance and not that much action. I love how the author makes the wolves, not werewolves. the only thing similar between werewolves and the wolves in the book is they shift from human to animal. I love how the infected humans are effected by the cold and warmth. It makes these wolves stand apart from any typical wolf shifting story. I thought the writing was done beautifully and doesn't sound kiddish. This is a book that I could read over and over again, and fall in love with the book each time.
B00A3DZ61W|3.0|Basically all the same just a little different.  Want something new try bad piggies by Angry Birds, but all about the pigs.

B0050QV0RQ|5.0|This game is well worth the 99&cent;, because it's just as good as one of those good old Game Boy Advanced games. This style of rpg is reminiscent of the first two Final Fantasy games and other games like them. The graphics are well made, and nothing seems poorly drawn. The overworld is large for a 99&cent; game, and the story makes sure your busy exploring it. Unlike the first Final Fantasy, you always know where to go and you never get lost, because the map tells you where you need to be for the story to continue. The Japanese voices during battle are entertaining and clear. The battles are fun. Monsters don't come out of nowhere, and they're exposed as sprites inside dungeons so that you aren't annoyed by random encounters. The monsters respawn every time you reenter a floor, so you don't have to worry about running out of things to kill. There are plenty of items, but there aren't so many that you get confused. The storyline is easily followed, and its not confusing. The game is meaty enough to keep you entertained for many hours. VERDICT: BUY and RATE WELL.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is a fun game you get to build your own city any way you what and makes time fly
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I completely enjoyed this series.  It's frustrating new episodes will not be available until Jan. 2014!  The story may be a bit predictable at times but well worth watching.

0316017930|5.0|Some things manage to remain hidden in plain sight for the longest time and then suddenly, in the blink of an eye, someone or something somehow manages to lift the veil of mystery from their existence. Others may not be hidden but their cause and effect mechanisms are not fully understood until a unique perspective finally comes along and combines common sense with the multiple streams of psychology, history, culture and mathematics flowing in the background. With 'Outliers' Mr. Gladwell somehow manages to accomplish both these 'little miracles' in a seemingly effortless manner. The ability to perform these rare feats simultaneously immediately makes it one of the rarest and most important books I have ever read.<br /><br />Is it the most original of ideas? Not exactly, but Malcolm Gladwell has researched and presented it in such an approachable manner that it casts a spell from the first sentence onwards while his endearing and rather intimate finale leaves the readers with plenty of questions and a non-traditional framework/philosophy/platform to utilize and derive our own answers. Did the Beatles invent Pop music? The honest answer would be No but they did bring it to the masses. The same concept applies to what the author has managed to accomplish with this book.<br /><br />From the similarities between hockey players, Jewish lawyers, Bill Gates and the Beatles to the elaborate analyses of rice farming, plane crashes and cultural heritage, Gladwell manages to capture and define the intricately dynamic nature of meaningful work and success in an endearingly rational manner. Way off the charts and without a single doubt, HIGHLY recommended.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Retro gameplay with sleek graphics. Tons of fun, gets challenging quickly but no learning curve. Would recommend to anyone who likes space invaders type games.

B00BYKIKJS|5.0|The book was so different-especially the roles of Nikki and the father-but more positive energy than the book. Loved Chris Rock as the friend from the psych hospital
B005LAIHYU|4.0|As a person who admires what Abraham Lincoln did and stood for I am always open to various interpretations of the man. This, by far, is the most inventive of the scenarios. Weaving real life events with a vampire story as the catalist makes for interesting viewing. I just feel that the special effects outweigh the actual fictional story, as with most horror films. Stick to the story and add in some special effects and you have a winner. In any event, this was fun and the twist at the end on the train with the vampires was unexpected. P.S. Maybe the vampires are already amongst us, say, in Congress!!

It arrived in perfect condition and in short order.

B005LAIGRS|5.0|This is a fast action thriller with an ever-increasing body count. The main actor is Denzel Washington who is CIA agent that some say has gone rogue. He comes across a secret electronic device by chance that everybody wants. To complicate matters there is a mole in the CIA organization that is unknown to all. But he is like left-handed monkey wrench. He has lots of directing authority and his actions are never question. Meanwhile there is a group of bad people who want Tobin Frost death. They want what he has and will stop at nothing to get it. So, Washington is on the run only scant seconds ahead of those who are chasing him. In a blaze of gunfire and car chases Washington barely escapes and keeps on running. The problem is he is running out of options. So Washington turns himself into the CIA. He comes in out of the cold. The CIA team takes him to a \\"Safe House\\" run by the actor Ryan Reynolds who is the \\"Keeper\\" of the \\"Safe House.\\" Reynolds does a superb job of acting as Matt Weston who operates a \\"Safe House\\" with nobody in it. He wants a European field assignment. Although he has the skills he lacks seniority. The interrogation begins but there are too many questions with very few answers. Meanwhile the bad guys attack the \\"Safe House.\\"  The world as they know it explodes with Washington and Reynolds on the run or chasing each other. The mole continues doing his dirty work and Washington must improvise and overcome to stay ahead of all the groups of bad guys who have now joined in the chase. Washington saves the life of Reynolds but in so doing puts his own life in jeopardy. He tells Reynolds what the final after-action briefing with the CIA Director will be like. Then he dies. So the ending is weak because I feel a stronger ending would have been better. Say vanishing like a ghost into the murky waters of oblivion or something like that. Now the last scene does work for me. It brings closure to a wild shoot-them-up film. The director did a great job with all the subplots that came at the viewer like being in an old-fashion snowball fight at recess. So I recommend this movie to all fans of Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds. I loved it. So, I gave it five stars. This review does not in any way spoil it for those who have yet not seen this film. I also recommend \\"Safe House\\" for the heartbreak action and the storyline that keeps the viewer on the edge until the end.he subplots that came at the viewer like being in an old-fashion snowball fight at recess.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I deal with my tablet, laptop, desktop and phone. I no longer need to transfer the information or print it out.  I have found Evernote helpful in keeping my notes, projects and information available when I need it and that is just the free version.
B004ULNJIU|4.0|Jason Statham did his usual superb acting job but the movie as a whole did not meet my expectations. The bad guy seemed to have it all his way until the very end. So in that respect it had a redeeming quality that the good guys with persistence and determination will win in the end. It was an all British film and did show how the police department works there. So all and all I did like it but not to give it five stars. In the same order I received \\"Safe\\" also with Jason Statham. Now this film I would give five stars because of the action and the fast pace of the film. There is a little girl who has a thing with numbers and what a memory of them! I strongly recommend \\"Safe!\\"
0307476464|5.0|Wow. What an experience! Let me start by being upfront: I have loved reading Haruki Murakami for a long time. There are some books I've liked more than others, but I've never felt disappointed. With 1Q84, once again I had a very memorable reading experience that left me feeling that this was time well spent.<br /><br />Good thing, too! This is a chunkster - over 1,000 pages. It's divided into three books (for clarity, when I say book I'm referring to the entire work). If you haven't read anything else by Murakami, I'm not sure 1Q84 is a good starting place unless you're already a huge fan of surrealism and magical realism. (A good starting place for those feeling a bit daunted would be The Elephant Vanishes, a collection of short stories.)<br /><br />It is not a requirement to have read George Orwell's 1984 before reading 1Q84. References to Orwell are common enough (Big Brother, for example) and at one point, a very brief overview of Orwell's book is given during a conversation between characters.<br /><br />Throughout the book there are these little threads, even very early on, which are all joined together by the end. A number of references are made hundreds of pages apart from each other, happening to different characters, even; yet not one tiny detail is forgotten.<br /><br />Pretty much every note I made as I was reading turned out to be useless for review; I really do not want to spoil this experience for anyone. I will say that I loved how much I didn't see coming. I loved the surprises, the suspense, the intrigue, the mystery. But again, that is all done within Murakami's surreal, magical world, so don't expect an action-packed novel. At times it feels more like suspended animation. Time feels like it's happening at different rates and in alternate streams. It's a lot to take in.<br /><br />Murakami is a master. He gets away with things I would never allow another author to do! For example, the love story aspect. It seems to have no reason behind it at all and it's steeped in that overly sappy \\"if it's meant to be\\" sentiment I usually loathe. But at the same time, it makes perfect sense, and I'm okay with it. And throughout the book, I'm accepting things that I know I have no good reason to accept. It's infuriating how often he messes with my head, and how much I love it! Murakami brings me into his fictional world as if it's reality and... well, now that's a pretty interesting statement, now that I think about everything that happened in 1Q84...<br /><br />There has been chatter about the possibility of a Book 4, but I like the ending as is. I can't help but feel that Murakami has taken the best aspects of his early works and combined it with the best aspects of his most recent, ending up with 1Q84. I agree with those who have referred to 1Q84 as Murakami's magnum opus.and it's steeped in that overly sappy \\"if it's meant to be\\" sentiment I usually loathe.

B009POCG2C|5.0|Here is a movie I did not expect from Clint Eastwood. But he has a way of surprising his fans as well as his critics! In this film Clint Eastwood plays the role of an aging baseball scout. He has been doing it for years and he is very good at what he does. But like all of us he is aging; his eyes are not what they use to be. He compensates by using his hearing like people who are vision impaired do. His character's name is Gus Lobel and Gus can tell a pitch just by the crack of the bat. Thus he refuses to be benched for what may be his final season in his outstanding baseball-scouting career. But Gus may not have a choice. The front office of the Atlanta Braves is starting to question his judgment, especially with the country's hottest batting phenomenon on deck for the draft. Gus needs help to prove that all is not what it seems and the one person who might be able to help him is his daughter. But she is the one person Gus would never ask. His daughter Mickey is played by Amy Adams and plays the role of an associate at a high-powered Atlanta law firm whose drive and ambition has put her on the fast track to becoming partner. So against her better judgment, and over Gus's objections, Mickey joins him on his latest scouting trip to North Carolina, jeopardizing her own career to save his. This is a heartwarming story of what true families do when trouble shows its ugly head. Yes, they all pitch in to resolve the problem. So can Mickey help Gus? Will this film have a happy ending? Will Gus stick by his guns? You have to see it to find out! The title &#34;Trouble with the Curve&#34; makes for a really great movie! I gave it five stars because it is a movie like I use to see when I was a kid. Yes, one that when it was over you felt really good about life and left the theater with a smile on your face knowing that the good guy had faced all odds and had come out on top! I strongly recommend &#34;Trouble with the Curve.&#34;
B00BETX5PS|5.0|I love Bond.  I don't know if this is the best Bond movies, but it ranks with Goldfinger and Dr. No.  I have read every Ian Fleming Bond book and seen every movie umpteen times.
B00AMBH70S|1.0|I didn't think it was possible to make another movie based on the Bourne Trilogy that could possibly suck this much.  I was wrong.  I also didn't think you could screw up a Bourne movie by casting Jeremy Renner and Ed Norton.  I was wrong.<br /><br />Don't waste your time or money.  This movie is so boring and so uninteresting from start to finish.

B009NG1Q96|3.0|It wasn't a horrible book, but there were several times I wanted to smack America.  Though, in her defense, I wasn't too bright at that age either (when it comes to boys).  I just didn't feel much depth in this book, as a majority of it felt like rehash of the previous.  I was ready to move past that, but alas it was not meant to be.  The saving grace for me was some backstory and characters being a bit more fleshed out.  Hence I only am giving a 3, with the sincere hopes the next book is much better an  out soon.  If not, maybe I'll finish it myself, I hear fabrics are the rage these days, lol.

B00BMKDTNC|1.0|I believe Sanderson sees himself as the rebirth of Jordan that's what the Rand and Moridin symbolizes, it's not true sir.  Not only was this not worth extending the release over a year past its promised time it wasn't worth waiting 3 plus extra months to get on my kindle.  You all should be ashamed at gouging the consumer and ruining what could have been the Tolkien series of our time for money.  The last batch of chapters were 6 to 10 pages long, and skipped out in the middle of the current story? Seriously?  And the gall at leaving open more questions than ever? you, steward, failed in your duty.  Rand wrapped up.  What of the tinkers song, or Perrin did Fail live, why did Hawkwing not destroy the beliefs of seanchan.  Tolkien wrapped up proper while leaving us to gather the rest with hints. Hell Rowling even gave a propper ending to Potter. We had hints at the other characters to imagine our ending with Potter.  Rand rode away the 3 knew fine!  You stop midstride with Perrin, Matt, and the others.  Christ could Matt have at least seen his dad and had a pat on the back. A sentence from Loial, what of Thom?  Talmanes Leane, Min Christ is she Doomseer or free? Avienda is wise one, Elayne Queen.  Who runs the whitecloaks, the Band and what of Morgase and her love and the last of th shiado?  Nope you failed. I understand the wheel turns no begging no endings, but you literally left no endings worth the time of 20 years of literature.  And I will not buy or read the sequels I know they are pushing for. Oh 1 more, promised to explain how the same people came thru the gateway to open the dam but just left it out.  All the characters you ignored and plot facts. Adam collars can shatter with the true source so a forsaken left damane nope. I don't want to be mad but I am not gonna say I am pleased like others just cause they are afraid of insulting Jordan. This book does that anyway.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Interesting book with lots of plot twist and interesting plot Anne conflict  a must read with details that make the story seem real
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved these books, I can't wait to see if they come out with more. I am not a reader by any means it only took me 2 weeks to read the trilogy that I downloaded on my kindle..
B00BI73CVI|2.0|This movie/musical had great A-listed actors trying to sing.  The roles in musicals are generally given to singers not actors, for good reason.  I would not recommend this to anyone. Other than Ann Hathaway, the rest of the actors/singers grunted their way through the musical.

B0069G5Z9K|3.0|I have not used it myself and did not get an accurate  opinion from my grandchildren. Not a lot was said about it.
B002HFWAWW|3.0|&#34;Equilibrium&#34; is a small gem of a film, not just a remake but a complete reworking of &#34;Farenheit 451,&#34; on which it is based.  It has a great cast, with pre-Batman Christian Bale as a tortured action hero, and Angus McFayden as his wily antagonist (now better known Taye Diggs is touted on the artwork, but his role really is subservient to McFayden's); it also features powerhouse performers Sean Bean and Emily Watson is roles that are short on screen time but long in effect.  The film was virtually dumped into theaters, with Miramax doing the least they could do in its distribution, so it didn't really take off until its release on DVD and corresponding runs on cable.  Miramax had a second chance when they released the film on blu-ray, but they screwed it up again.  The DVD was letterbox and had two commentary tracks plus a &#34;making of&#34; featurette;  the blu-ray converted the frame to the standard 16x9 HD, and left off the commentaries (but kept the featurette).  Now a second blu-ray version has been released by Alliance Entertainment, which has all the features of the DVD, except the framing, which is still the 16x9, despite being advertised as being the 2:35 ratio.  While this is annoying, it is not a tragedy, because nothing of the original frame line is lost (16x9 conversion doesn't &#34;cut off&#34; top or sides of the picture, just changes the proportions), only the effect of the presentation the director chose;  most blu-ray players will allow you change the format, so you can choose &#34;letterbox&#34; and see the film in the original proportions (but the image will be a bit stretched, most noticeable in faces).  Also, while the quality of the blu-ray is better than the DVD, it is not vastly superior, probably due to the film's budget in the first place.  If you are a stickler for the widescreen, already own the DVD, and have the kind of blu-ray player that &#34;upgrades&#34; DVD images, I think you can get by without the blu-ray disc.  If you value the BR upgrade more than the format, the blu-ray is inexpensive enough to take the plunge, but you need to be sure you get the right version.  The new Alliance release, which has cover art featuring Christian Bale large on the right, a small Taye Diggs behind and the tunnel with circle pendants going backwards to infinity, has the commentaries.  If you don't already have the DVD, or don't want to have to keep it just for the commentaries, you must buy this version.  The Miramax version, released a few years ago, has Bale, Diggs, and Emily Watson in a triptych on the cover art, and is probably less expensive;  it does not have any commentary tracks, only the &#34;making of&#34; featurette.  You should only buy this version if you are prepared to keep your DVD, or if you don't care about listening to the director's commentary.  All in all, when it comes to this film on blu-ray, I'd rather have it than not, but I shake my head at the missed opportunites.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is easy to use and I have found a devotional plan in it that I have begun. I purchased it when the series on TV was  starting

0762445262|3.0|Product was received in a timely manner and in great condition.  Let there be no mistake, this is a MINI kit.  Bat Signal is perfect size to play with action figures.  The Signal works well in a dark room 2-4 ft away from the surface that you are trying to light up.  Not sure why they included a book with the product, but there is a MINI book as well, about 2-3 in tall.  Solid toy, feel a better description is needed.
B002O3Z4QQ|5.0|This movie is astounding the way they show how NASA launched their missions to get to the moon. I have seen a movie like this when I was younger, but I cannot find the movie that inspired me to learn more about space travel. I would recommend this movie to others.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|As far as apps. go, especially for a calculator, this one is very easy to use, easy to read, and just plain easy.  if you need an easy to use calculator, for adding up bills, or even basic math, this is the one for you...

B004SN7846|2.0|size is tricky. heavy for minimalist shoes...And I returned them for those reasons. Might be good for non-minimalists if they were lucky enough to jump the tricky sizing hurdle.
B00513DEWM|3.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who is curious about 19th century aristocracy.  To be born and live during this time was to be either of the upper or the lower class of people.  If in fact, the portrayal of these characters was representative of true actions and beliefs, then society was really in a poor state.  I found the chapters to be redundant with constant repetition of the same idea almost as though the author was paid by the number of words per chapter.  Too bad, as the premise of &#34;selling your soul to the devil&#34; makes for an interesting topic.  What would you do to live a special life free from getting old?  We are introduced to the consequence and the mental anguish that the main character suffers.  It shows us that &#34;we don't always know what is best for us and that we must be careful of what we wish for?  This was a book club selection or I would not have otherwise finished it.  I had read it when I was very young, revisiting it, I found that my impression of it had changed dramatically therefore I could only give it 3 stars.

B0051ANPZQ|3.0|Good enough to keep me up late at night reading into the next chapters...characters were diverse and the change of narration was creative and intriguing.  This is definitely a unique, heart felt story.  I just wasn't as emotionally captivated as I was hoping.

B00AJER3SE|4.0|I know that this film has unfortunately been double dipped quite a few times. However, this edition of the Terminator is THE one to own. I've had the pleasure of seeing the film in multiple formats (VHS, DVD, broadcast) and I have to say that this is the best I've ever seen it look.

0062238310|3.0|I thought it will be more excited , but it was more about the script ! If I knew I don't think I was going to order it !
0143119680|3.0|If I remember correctly, I bought this book about 4 months after it was published, mainly because the abstract attracted me. I had truly enjoyed the \\"Harry Potter\\" series and I must admit that I had (and still have) a soft spot for the \\"Twilight\\" saga.<br /><br />The author has built here a well balanced mixture of fantasy, romance, history and suspense by focusing mainly on the mysterious alchemy manuscript that is Ashmole 782. Her story is beautifully written and includes a lot of details that helps the reader immerse him/herself into the story. I particularly enjoyed her well researched historical description as well as the description she makes of Oxford and its campus and libraries. It felt has if I was there instead of here when I read those. I felt committed to the story. Until...<br /><br />Until, I advanced further into the story and realized that it tended to resemble more and more an adult version of Twilight. At first it didn't truly bother me that much; should the author have adapted the love story and sensual details to the fact that her two main characters are in their mid-thirties, it would have probably been fine. The problem is that she didn't which makes this part of the plot sound unrealistic and a tad bit too cheesy.<br /><br />As for the characters, I found that the author's strength lied mainly with her supporting characters (such as Marcus, Ysabeau, Sarah and Emily) more that with Diana and Matthew, who are her mains characters.<br /><br />All in all, a dense book where immersing yourself remains a possibility as long as you're able to live with the occasional lack of realism of the two main characters.<br /><br />For more on this book and others, visit my blog at:<br /><br />ladybugandotherbookworms.blogspot.com
B00B2V66VS|1.0|The graphics looked amazing but the game is just not working for me..I can not figure out how to get away from the monster. I get killed almost instantly every time, which also is quite scary. Therefore, it gets frustrated so I deleted it again. It looks good if one knows how to properly move around.
B0090EHVMC|3.0|The story makes an excellent point that is very applicable for the mindset of our current business leadership, both in government and corporations...as well as our own personal philosophy to live by. Danny DeVito really adds to the movie's quality...
B009UX2YAC|4.0|My 4 year old son loves this game. I think it is a little difficult to stay ahead of the police officer, making it very hard to get very far with the character. So it seems as if one runs through the same exact area hundreds of times, which starts to be boring. My son doesn't mind it at all and has started to unlock other characters. Good game, but I wished it wasn't quite that challenging, where one never can get very far before being caught by the police officer.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|So happy to have had the opportunity to read this great series. Thank you Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson for the many hours spent enjoying your world
B00BEZTMWW|4.0|Bought it for hubby and he opened it and watched it immediately. He loved the fact that it was in so many formats. Thanks for making him a happy camper.
B004CS7R70|3.0|I wanted powerful TV glasses in order to be able to read small print on my large-screen television set (47 inches) from a distance of about nine feet.  The Eschenbach MaxTV Binocular Glasses allow me to do this and, as a result, I've been able to use my TV as a computer monitor for the last month or so.<br /><br />The reason I didn't give them five stars, however, is because they have two flaws: For one thing, the field of view is a bit narrow and this means getting use to viewing my TV with a few inches cut off at the corners.  The other reason is that they are rather heavy compared to regular glasses and they tend to slowly slide down my nose so that after a few minutes, I have to push them up again.  I find this very annoying - especially when I think of the price I paid.  I did, however, find a solution recently:  I wrapped some string around the inside of the hinges (they join the end pieces to the temples) so that the temples are forced inwardly and fit more tightly against the sides of my head.  This prevents the glasses from slipping down my nose.<br /><br />Here is my message to Eschenbach Optik:  Increase the field of view and make the temples adjustable so that they can fit snugly around the wearer's head.  If you don't know how to do this or you don't want to do it, then reduce the price by at least half.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is one of his best. I absolutely loved this book. The characters were a little move vivid than some of his others and there was the element of suspense that kept me reading and staying awake too late at night!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|This was a perfect ending to a long journey. Well done Brandon Sanders and hats off to the grand master Robert Jordan.  I will always hold this as one of the greatest stories ever told.  I hope our next AGE is a better one. God bless. : )

B005OZE9SA|3.0|I didn't have luck running this on my laptop so I had to return it and buy a more expensive NI Komplete 6. Issues I've come across with:<br /><br />* there's a risk of clipping the input with electric guitar. I tried it with my vintage output LP and it was on the edge of clipping. My higher powered Ibanez would surely overdrive the input. Many people complain about that. It can be solved with a DI-box or buffer but it complicates things and decent price starts being less decent. There's a more expensive model (8i4 or something) that has pad switch that brings input level down, I cannot think of a reason they decided to drop it on this model. It's unusable with guitars with higher output.<br /><br />* drivers look like they are put together overnight. Compared to Native Instruments drivers, they look like child's play. I don't have confidence at all that they will work reliably in the long run. Audio would freeze after 10 seconds permanently, until I restart the app. I tried ASIO4ALL and it was better, but still had short drops every 10 seconds. Maybe it could be improved, but didn't want to take chances.<br /><br />* noise level is noticeably higher than Komplete 6. It may not be a problem if you're recording from a mic or line level. But when using the interface to add distortion and effects to guitar signal, it will become an issue and very audible.<br /><br />All this may or may not apply to your application, but be aware of potential issues. I wanted it to work OK, loved the looks, but couldn't risk ending up with something that will not cut it, so I had to return it and get a more expensive one.
B009X01GJ2|5.0|This Marware product for your kindle is truly fantastic.  I checked other stores and looked at other Kindle Fire Cases but nothing as inexpensive as the Marware and it really works great, nothing better!!!
B00CATSONE|4.0|A good quick read!!!!!!! I read it at the airport waiting for a flight. Read it to learn technological history.
B00447L4KA|4.0|One of the best movies. It's great to see Heath Ledger in a role other than the joker. His antics in this movie always make me laugh and yet there is a good romantic story line
B00AEFY66U|1.0|Save yourself 2 hours and just read the book... Mia Farrow as Daisy?  Mia has never been a great actress and this movie shows all her flaws... unbelievably silly at times...
B001DM1VXE|1.0|I could not watch more than 10 or 15 minutes at the most of this dreadful film. Black & white format with terrible camera work was made even worse by the incomprehensible story line. I couldn't figure out what the he** was happening and, frankly, after a while I couldn't have cared less.  They could call this \\"intro to a migraine\\" and it would be more descriptive.
B00AE4OGCU|5.0|Could not put it down! I'd seen the movie so the first book wasn't as gripping the the final 2 were amazing
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|This movie was suggested to me by a friend after i dodged it for months because i doubted to could be all that interesting or well done. I was wrong and very glad to have bought and seen it. I was also told that someone on the radio criticised it. I am sure that whoever did that did not want to except, or didn't want to admit that  the USA intentional screw Iran for the sake of money and oil.

B00AKKTDJY|4.0|This is my favorite Dash game. It's challenging enough to hold my interest without being too difficult. I like that there's plenty of different &#34;actions&#34;, such as seating customers and cooking and serving different items. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I can't seem to find a way to reset the game once I've played it all the way through. Once I complete the game I want to start over again with a clean slate. I can replay but it doesn't allow me to use my game money to buy kitchen upgrades, etc.  Not sure if that makes sense but in some of the &#34;Mania&#34; games that I have it let's you have a username. When you've completed the game you just go to the beginning and change your username and you start with a clean slate again. Hope that makes sense. Either way this is a lot of fun, much better than some of the other Dash games.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a very fun game. I can play it all day long if I wanted to. The game has a perfect combination of ease, but it was also a little challenging.<br />Subway surfers is the perfect game for both children and adults too!
B008HJGPVO|5.0|I've had a few different styluses in my day, but this particular one has exceeded them all. To the point (pun intended) that using others just isn't an option. Worth every penny. Just don't constantly misplace it like I seem to do...
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is so much fun. I play some other bingo games and this one is my favorite play everyday
B0090SI4LU|3.0|The book is so captivating and it's a beautiful story. The characters evolve slowly, which is what makes the story believable. Given the two hours of film time, there wasn't enough space to portray the unfolding of the relationships and the slow chipping away at the barriers between the Soul and the humans, specifically between Wanda and Melanie. In the film, Wanda's personality was overshadowed by Melanie's. In the book, Wanda was courageous and stubborn in her own way, and she sometimes broke rules (which was considered unheard of in her race) to ensure the survival of those she loved. For example, when she snuck away from the cave with Jared to get medication for Jamie, in the film it came across as if the whole thing was Melanie's idea and Wanda was just a puppet. In the real story, Wanda ALWAYS put her own needs last - to the point where most of the humans were often compelled to defend and save Wanda from herself.<br /><br />In the book, Melanie's seeker always wore black and she was very obviously in direct conflict with the Souls' way of life. In the film, she actually blended in - they all wore white. In fact, the Souls in the book (with the exception of the Melanie's Seeker) are peace-loving, kind, simple, and unpretentious. In the movie, the blank faces and chrome vehicles made them come across as stoic, ostentatious, and sterile. In the book, the Souls were not actually evil, and Wanda wasn't alone in regretting the takeover of mankind. Their way was to live in harmony with other species, not take them over, and definitely not with violence. There were other souls, such as Fords Deep Waters, who shared her view. In the film, the Souls were just too polished, too slick, and too detached. The plot may not have changed in a major way but the overall pace and feel of the story was drastically different. These changes bothered me not because of the fact that the film didn't mirror the book, but because the overall message of the story got buried in chrome andLotuses.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Outstanding, but you can't really get far without spending money. Still, a great game. Much better than others I have tried.

B00999VI0Y|3.0|I have a nice sony ipod speaker dock(RDP-X500ip) that Apple rendered obsolete with the new lighting connector. I wanted to use this as way for my iphone 5 to continue to dock to it. Unfortunatley it did not work for this sony device.    It did however work fabulously with the iphone connector in my 2011 Mini Cooper so I had no need to return it.    A key thing to note is that when my ipod/iphone was at full blast the audio would sound like s***. Back off the volume on your ipod / iphone about 2 clicks from full volume and it will sound fabulous.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is a beautiful game, fun, challenging name one non great thing about this game. It's a great example for 2013 technology.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I have heard the name Tesla here and there, but never looked further into it.  Thank you Sean for your enlightenment.  Although I find it sad that Tesla was so misused and apparently not much of a business man...I wish he had had someone to assist him with that so that he could just fly freely.  I think if I had been alive back then, I would have been a Tesla groupie.  Lol...Sean your writing style is delicious to read for a hungry mind.  I look forward to reading more of your work.  Thank you for sharing you.

B00736ZKGS|5.0|I do not know much about this - but it was a gift for my daughter who is very happy with it.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Although some of the singing is not top notch, top notch singers would not have acted as well - so there is always a trade-off.
B00CBKVMG8|4.0|I enjoyed this era-based (1945) film. I enjoy action/crime dramas & the cinematography was great. LAPD the way they used to be.
B007X4ECMI|5.0|Plot: its the future and the President's daughter is trapped on a space-station/prison and needs to be rescued by a guy who has his own agenda for signing up for the mission: to find an inmate with information he needs.<br /><br />Okay, I loved this movie. Glaring physics errors aside (c'mon--the um... escape @ the end? that was ludicrous) but you have to willingly suspend disbelief. The haters can mock it, but come on, you expect some of the crazy stuff, right?<br /><br />What stood out for me were the one-liners. Snow was sarcastic and quippy. Aren't we tired of brooding heroes yet? He smart-mouthed, refused to take things seriously (on the surface) and got annoyed with the heroine.<br /><br />She was great! The dialogue between them was fun and snappy and she was more than arm-candy but not made into the stereotypical \\"tough\\" gal, or \\"secret ninja- 'oh I studied ballet which magically becomes perfectly useful to take out huge thugs'\\". Not Ripley-esque, which would not have suited her character anyway--but she made her presence known and made tough decisions.<br /><br />----SPOILERS----<br /><br />There was one particularly awkward part for me, as a viewer--that scene between the two of them when they are crouched behind --yet another--bulkhead. She rebukes him for leaving his friends behind/hung out to dry? Totally out of pace, character and plot. It made NO sense since she had no backstory on him. I felt like it was added to give them friction. A fake \\"misunderstanding\\"--what is this a bad romance novel?<br /><br />UNDERSTATED CHEMISTRY: THANK YOU ! The movie was so much better-ended this way than with a kiss. I liked it.<br /><br />Favorite quote: (after she takes his gun and is able to fire rounds semi-effectively) \\"I thought you were a democrat!\\"<br /><br />anyway, I recommend this movie. Definitely one I'll keep. But then I like campy, quippy movies... like The Mummy, Tremors, stuff like that :-) enjoy!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|A very touching and well wrote novel. One that truly pulls at your heart strings. Such a good book you can't stop reading.
B001AQR3MQ|5.0|Yah I know it sounds crazy, but this was my first actual blue ray. I am used to going to the theater or watching streaming movies. We finally got a blue ray drive and WOW! This was an excellent choice for the first. Love the movie, love the format :) Good seller too by the way, it came in just a couple of days.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|My old charger wasn't working properly, and so I called up Amazon to find out why my Kindle wasn't charging properly anymore.  It was taking longer and longer to charge - if at all.  They told me I should get this device, and that it should take care of my problem.  It did.  My Kindle is now charging in about 2 hours - every time.  Thank you Amazon.
B0064MGU98|4.0|Each episode is more like a mini-movie than a television show. Great actors and production. I love that she is such a strong but also human (flawed) character.

1451695195|5.0|This is a very good book about a near death experience by a man who really wasn't very spiritual. He connects us to the other side through his story about the journey. I found the book fascinating. I couldn't put it down.
B000002J1U|5.0|LED ZEPPELIN III is one of the best albums from the legendary LED ZEPPELIN....What more can you say....There´s plenty AMAZING ROCK songs here like IMMIGRANT SONG, FRIENDS, THAT´S THE WAY and GALLOWS POLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!TOTALLY GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!

BLACK SABBATH RULES and PARANOID is a MASTERPIECE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005GVW05Q|5.0|Ever since Whiskeytown, I've waited for Ryan to hit the ball out of the park. This is a really good album with thoughtful and beautiful songs. Norah Jones, Benmont Tench, and even Ryan's wife Mandy Moore really add to the loveliness. I love this album.
B000002JSN|5.0|While i can´t really say which ZEPPELIN album is their best, this PHYSICAL GRAFFITI sure is among their finest work.....I love almost ALL the songs....There´s only inspired HEAVY ROCK songs with the best ROCK band of all time!!!!!!!!TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!!!!
B008LZHA3G|4.0|I was just talking with a friend about how William Shakespeare and Bob are the two greatest literary figures we knew. OK, I'm sure some will argue for others to be in that pantheon, but they're both way up there. This is just another example. Bob remains always interesting. Writing this makes me want to go and listen to it again.

B000002KCV|5.0|I actually recently got this for my sister, because it's such a special album. It's not crunching rock, which we all know Neil is great at, but its quieter, emotionally deep with lovely harmonies from the late Nicolette Larson. Great album!

B008DVJO8C|4.0|Not only does Maria Brink have one hell of a voice, but seriously, how many female vocalists do you know of that can actually scream with any amount of talent? I originally bought this as a gift for someone else but quickly fell in love and had to have a copy for myself. It's dark, bloody, emotional & in your face.

0385394233|5.0|This is a fantastic book! Yes Sheryl has it all!  I appreciate how she is very frank about how hard it can be to rise to the top, and like how she encourages women to go for it.  It is a balancing act for moms who work outside of the home, but they have so much to contribute.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Extremely satisfying when you complete a level. Very entertaining &amp; enjoyable for both kids &amp; adults. No issues with it at all.

B0094KF4WG|4.0|Gives the reader great inside information on a mission of this nature. The courage and coolness of the team is amazing.
B0055N0FZM|4.0|Very sad and moving... visited the house in Amsterdam where the Frank family were in hiding, late last year, and saw for myself how they must have suffered and unfortunately for Anne and most of her family, it was all for nothing.<br />From what I gathered, had they dispersed and stayed with family and friends instead of wanting to stay together, most would have survived.
B008EK91XU|4.0|A great account of the personal side of the great swimmer - information not revealed previously. The pressures revealed behind the scenes.
B00CBKVMG8|1.0|This was far and away the most disappointing movie I've seen in a long, long time. The final product was a slick and soulless journey to nowhere. I wanted to like it. I tried to like it. But it didn't like me back. It didn't try to like me back. It didn't make the effort for me to care about the characters or their motives. For example, (spoiler)Ryan Gosling doesn't want any part of the squad until a kid gets mowed down in the line of fire. Now this is a scene we've seen a thousand times before in thousand movies just like this one. Sometimes it works. But here, there's no relationship with the kid, we have no investment in him. The whole scene screams out at you, \\"Hey, I'm in this movie to justify Gosling joining the squad.\\" But it has no heart. And every scene in the movie is like that. The scenes play out like concepts, like ideas of what the filmmakers want you to feel, but they never actually take you on that journey. I say \\"filmmakers\\" and not simply director because it's very hard to know if the director or the producer is responsible. I mean, the cast has terrific talent and something must have drawn them to the project--other than just a paycheck. But the final edit is so poor, it's hard to tell if there was any life in the screenplay to begin with. It does feel like the potential was all there, but in the end, it's just a crude mash-up of The Untouchables and LA Confidential, without taking the time to be its own thing and letting the story develop through the interaction of the characters. In summary, my experience of this movie felt less like watching a movie and more like watching a video game--a video game that someone else is playing without ever giving you a turn to interact with the world or the characters yourself. And that video game was marketed \\"M\\" for mature, but was produced by \\"T\\" for teenagers.
0062215507|5.0|This book is wonderful! It has information & pictures from the filming of the movies as well as interesting information we haven't read before. Trust me, I've read anything I can find. I loved the series and have really missed having new installments to look forward to. The best thing about this book is that it's like a scrapbook. There's Harry's invitation to Hogwarts in there. You also get the marauders map, an invitation to the Yule Ball, Things like that. That's what really makes this book exciting to own. I highly recommend it to any Harry Potter fan.
0525952926|1.0|I was just getting into the book, was on page number 50, and to my dissatisfaction the next page was page 115. Pages 51 through 114 are missing from the book. It is brand new!!!!!!! I want my money back!!!!!!!!!!! Had to order another copy from the library and wait for it to come to my local library. Of course page 50 ends in suspense. What's wrong with the newborn baby???? Who knows? The next page is 115. Sooooooooo Mad.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|On my Pandigital Planet about 40% for the time the graphic picture of the people would not display.  To fix this I had to start the game.  You could play the game just fine with the graphic issue.
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|I absolutely loved the movie. It is about 6 people who reincarnate through time. It shows how some people evolve for better or worst. It is a little hard sometime to figure out who the people are because through time they can be either a man or a woman. But I loved watching this different kind of movie. I wish they would have made available the movie to buy before this.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I was able to play this game on both my Pandigital Novel and Pandigital Planet and yes you need tohave a WIFI connection to play.  But that why it was free or .99C.  I love this game!
0812984412|4.0|I am one of those people who can appreciate a book, a play or a movie, simply because it is so different and unique - and I may not even like it - but still appreciate the originality. This book is one of those unique undertakings. It is not an easy read - the author takes the reader to various scenarios with unusual dialogues and settings. But, there are interesting connections between the scenarios. This book is a challenge to read, but I'm glad I took the time to read it. I doubt if I can ever find another book that is this unique.
1596680180|5.0|This is a very well made book . Plenty of photo's and instructions for different braids. A very usefull book. Thank's.
B008476HBM|5.0|I love this book.  It takes you back to a time when things were completely different.  We can make choices as women.  Great book, great reading!
B009RI4ZKC|5.0|Very good story line.  I could really relate to the characters as I saw myself growing up.  Exceptional acting. I would watch it again.
B001LF347E|5.0|I am very impressed with the highly gifted and talented cast and their acting; the excellent, well-written, creative stories; and the development of both the stories and characters in Merlin. Merlin is a remarkable series; one that is rare:  meaningful and entertaining at the same time.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Terrific Josh!! This album is excellent. He has hit the nail on the head for sure. I really enjoy this cd as I did<br />his previous one. But this album is even better. The crossover arrangements are true to the originals and the backup singers and orchestra leave me applauding. I love it. This cd is NO disappointment at all! Good Job , such a talent. I do wish he would sing with Sarah Brightman again. Get the extended cd if you can. the additional songs are worth it.
B009VYF5E2|5.0|I am very impressed with the highly gifted and talented cast and their acting; the excellent, well-written, creative stories; and the development of both the stories and characters in Merlin.

B00BIVN82M|5.0|If that makes you think of the big band era and Lawrence Welk then you'll be extremely happy. I loved this cd.<br />Being a fan of Nancy Sinatra , I especially liked the recording of \\"Something Stupid\\" which she sang with her father. Michael and Reese Witherspoon do a good job liking it to the original. There's some other crossover hits and nastalgic songs. Very good sound and backup. Get the extended cd for the extra songs. It's worth it. It's nice to hear such a smooth voice that Michael has do such a variety. Love it.

B001GXTXTO|2.0|This album is way overrated.  What a total knockoff, and not even in a good way.  It is a \\"whiteboy blues cd\\"....for people whose musical needs are simple.
B005HSL626|3.0|This was a great one for my friend who has a 7 year old daughter.  She loves this game and it keeps her busy!
B000VYX8PE|5.0|I love this book and i just want to get the second book!! Great job on your writing Mr. Snicket! It's very creative!
B00005JLCI|5.0|Thank you for the 2 disk hamlet DVD. It was just whah I needed to make my colloction complete, thank you. .
B0091REZMW|4.0|Kind of addicting if I do say so myself.  I'm still beginning so I can't really tell about the whole game; but what I've seen so far is pretty darn fun.  Thankfully I run out of 'energy' at the right times or I wouldn't get anything else done.  A lot of what goes on I don't follow; I just like the hunt. Would recommend.
B009KEN87O|5.0|First game I got for my new kindle and its very fun! I feel like a kid again playing space invaders I love it. It really is a cool retro game and lots of fun.
B002YVAT72|5.0|Nice product .!!!! I love it. OK. I guess,  I will be a buy it again another unit in the future. I like it.
1451668945|3.0|A bit simplistic and a tad too easy to figure out (or maybe I got lucky for once!). Even one of the characters towards the end comments \\"What are the odds that ...\\" because many of the plot devices are way too unlikely. Hate to be sexist but this book - \\"like her others\\" my wife comments - tends to be heavy on the \\"chick lit\\" characteristics. I for one would rather have a character described by height and weight as opposed to dress size. Still, a good piece of mind candy for the beach or as an audio book for a long ride.
1476734941|5.0|This book is easy reading, makes a lot of sense and easy to follow.  Love this concept and is working for me so far.
B00BEWCJFM|5.0|It's great to have Iron Maiden capturing several eras in amazing live albums while they're still together and still a VERY viable band.  They have so much great music that if they did just one live album there would have to be 30 or 40 songs on it.  So, if you love Maiden, this is great!
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Enough enjoyment to keep kids occupied when absolutely necessary.  Will keep them quiet for a few minutes so not a complete loss.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|All of us have habits, both good and bad.  In this well-written summary of some of the ways our habits not only influence the choices we consciously make, but also how science has created insights that are now widely used in areas such as business and the law. It also gives insights into how we might go about changing some of those bad habits that we all want to change.

B00632HWOG|1.0|What year is this? I expect to be able to adjust the mail sync frequency or disable it altogether. Not only does this awful app not provide a setting to do that, but it also ignores the Android Yahoo account sync setting. I've tried two previous versions of the app, and I won't be installing it again until they advertise the inclusion of this feature.
B00009AOBI|4.0|This movie was one I had never seen before. I had caught part of it on TV one day , and was dying to see the rest. So i bought it. Such a sweet heartfelt movie, with  great characters and lets admit it , who doesnt love CHER !!!
B003XF1OJK|5.0|I am not the type of person who is going to thoroughly critique a book by analyzing every little detail. I'm also not going to write a book about how good/bad this book is. More power to the people that do that, I am just not good at that sort of thing.<br /><br />  To put it simply, this was a good read. I enjoyed how the book talks about how the Spartans, John 117 more specifically, came to be. There are a lot of details that \\"fill in the gaps\\" that the games didn't cover. Again, I personally enjoyed this book and now look forward to continuing the entire series! If you are a halo fan, you WILL enjoy this book.
1936891026|5.0|This book will help you kick resistance to the curb.  I'm your typical creative writer.  Wrote stories, plays, poems and songs since I could hold a pen.  Even turned writing into a career as a professional copywriter.  But the carcasses of unfinished novels littered my past.  Enter War of Art.  After two readings I decided to stop sucking my shoelaces, feeling sorry for myself and follow Stephen's advice.  I added Alan Watts 90 Day Novel program to Stephen's regimen and marched to the finish of the novel I started nine years ago.  When good, bad, ugly, surly, blissful moods showed up  I remember what Stephen talked about inthe book and kept typing.  If you're tired of getting your butt kicked by resistance, then this my be just the boot you need to your rear too.  Some people mention all the woo-woo stuff at the end of the book as a negative.  As an atheist, I'm not into that either but I do light a candle as an homage to the creative process every morning and put in my two hours.  I can't recommend this book enough.
B000NY12LO|5.0|This is one of my favorite books.  It was just as good the second time through as it was the first time I read it in 2008.
B0063M22QO|4.0|It's a very entertaining game. I like playing it when I need a few minutes to relax.  The price is also a good incentive to buy it.

B0058A119G|5.0|This album is terrific in the choice of songs as well as the arrangements.  Barbra's voice to me is phenomenal when she sings ballads and songs like &#34;Don't Rain on My Parade&#34; which is not on this CD.  I also love the lyrics of Alan and Marilyn Bergman; they're filled with feeling, meaning, and they are beautiful!  I would recommend this album to anyone who is a Barbra fan as well as to those who are not, especially, if they like songs that are melodious and have lyrics that make sense.  Even if they don't, they should at least listen to this CD and others she has recorded over the years.<br />I listen to this album in my car and each time, which is frequently, I hear things I did not hear before.  She keeps me company when I am in my car alone and I really couldn't ask for more pleasure!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great for long car rides and waits. The graphics are great and my sister and I love it very much.
0374531269|5.0|I believe this book was a wonderful example of the horrible cycle of human exploitation taking in place in not only Sierra Leon but also around the entire world where human rights are not fought for. Ishmael's graphic and detailed depiction of his struggles as a young boy resonate so strongly with the reader on an emotional. What we also need to take into account is what this means on a larger scale about the nation and its relation to the rest of the world. Like the children of this book, the nation is in a way a victim as well. The pressures brought onto the nation directly get thrown onto its youth. Young boys are pressured to leave their families, sometimes seeing them get shot in front of their own eyes, and sent off to a world of drugs and violence. Young girls being forced into sexual situations which aside from be completely involuntary are also concepts way beyond their capacity of understanding at their young ages. What does this all reinforce to the reader of this book? The future of the nation is going down a bad path. The citizens of this nation will either remain corrupt, not have a voice, or their lucky ones will escape as we see in this book. The worse part of all this is that all around the world, we all become desensitized to the struggles; even the people living the struggle. After generations of breeding boy soldiers, this life becomes a custom of a nation and then it expands to becoming a region of the world. Child exploitation is a very present and alive problem all over the world. Though Ishmael survived the struggle there are plenty of other people just as young that are going through this painful lifestyle and that inevitably results in addiction, emotional trauma and death.<br /><br />This problem is definitely significant enough around the world to damage the potential of growth, personal freedom and safety around the world. I feel very strongly about the idea that the stories we read in this book occur all over the world. Some regions maynot event get the bit of exposure that the children of this country did. UNICEF is only one organization, and the problems all over the world are like parasites that consistently latch on and grow all over. The infection is a struggle that will take more than one organization of to cure. It is a change in structure that these countries need; and deconstruction of the corruption may be successful if fought consistently...but we know that doing such a thing is a difficult task that to this date, there have been limited numbers of people/movements that have been successful. Aside from the desensitization, we must also battle the mentalities that certain peoples have established in their minds depending on their culture.<br /><br />A person/organization must be careful in attempting to help without intruding on the views of those they are trying to help. In all, this book was a truly insightful, though incredibly heart wrenching with the mindset that this is in fact a memoir. To read the views of one person's account only made me wonder what eles happened to others that could possibly be worse. So many untold stories through voices that may not be able to live to see tomorrow...it's the sad reality of the world and the ever present pressures of globalization.
B000EULJLU|5.0|This is such an amazing album coming from an equally amazing band. Words cannot describe the powerful wave of emotion that passes threw everytime i listen to this album. If you like music that makes you think and feel connected to the very fabric of existince then you will love this cd. I am huge Tool fan, every album is nothing less than amazing including this one. When I first listen to it I thought it was good but it took me two or three times going threw the album to get a good grasp of what was all going on. Its my form of theropy, no matter how crappy of a day it is I listen to this and I feel so much better about everything it just connects with me on every level. All the music i used to like dont really sound that great anymore after discovering the awsomeness of TooL. Buy this album!!! Im glad I did
0307887448|4.0|I wouldn't say it's a masterpiece or the best book ever written or anything like that, but it's pretty darned fun.  Willy Wonka meets Willy Gibson is an accurate description, if you marinate it in 1980s pop culture references.

What I especially respect is that some scenes still show the original texture of the film grain which captures and preserves the 70mm canvas the film was originally exposed on.<br /><br />The acting is pretty good too. Oh, and don't forget to crank up the sound on this! Gorgeous mix!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I totally recommend this incredibly astonishing game in HD graphics. My favorite part is that it's pixelated. The one thing that I do not like is that you can't change it from creative to survival. The XBOX 360 version is better, but it's great!!!
B0000CDJPQ|5.0|Shhhhh! Don't tell my iMac that I've been connecting FireWire 400 devices in the guise of FireWire 800 connectivity!<br /><br />I have several FireWire 400 drives and two minidv cameras that use FireWire 400 out and I have no problem connecting them via the Sonnet 400 to 800 adapter. My iMac has a Thunderbolt connection and Apple has only a FireWire 800 to Thunderbolt adapter available. With the Sonnet FireWire 400 to 800 adapter, problem solved!<br /><br />No issues. No fuss.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|What can I say? I fell in love with this book the first time I heard about it! Stiil lovet it too! Even after all that research....*shudder*....
B0036G8IQS|5.0|Rick Riordan  is the best.  My son has read all of his books at least 10 times.  Seriously.  cannot say enough
B0015AARJI|1.0|The analog sticks on this controller are absolutely horrible compared to all my other dualshock controllers. When I contacted customer service about having it returned, they told me that the controller needs to be broken in. Well, I've had this controller for 9 months, and it's just as bad as the day I got it. I can't play shooting games, racing games, or any game that requires fine movement of the analog sticks (which is most games). I feel stupid for listening to customer service and not returning it when I had the chance.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|Every single sentence is an inspiration and motivation for me. It teaches you about how important you are and how to get best out of one. The secret really works.
B00AFEY7QO|5.0|Swing Out Sister once again does a fabulous performance and I really liked their jazz-oriented rendition of their popular songs. A great addition to your collection for Swing Out Sister fans!
B00AFROVQC|4.0|I was amazed how fast I was drawn in this story. The story  move with great speed, and before I knew it I was at it end.  To me the story is a lot like king Arthur.  I am hope the next one is just as good.
B009GED3HS|5.0|How I Met Your Mother is one of my favorite shows. When I'm having a bad day, I love just sitting back and watching. They are hilarious!!
B004EPZ03Y|5.0|I saw this movie at the movie theater with my family and we loved it.  My son wanted me to buy it so he could keep watching.
B009LK6JS2|5.0|This app is awesome and all but would be way better if you would add a multiplayer mode.That way you could play online with other people and free roam<br />l
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I am a huge fan, so I had to get the next season of DA.  Love the acting and writing!!!
B001DM1VXE|3.0|It is a watchable movie for a techie. Could have been better. Some of the parts in the movie were not very comprehensive.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I love Susan Boyle and this is a great CD.  A great addition to anyone's collection.  Her duet with Donny Osmond is wonderful!
6304696566|4.0|The movie was great; however, it very loosely followed the actual events involving Cynthia Ann Parker and Quanna Parker. Maybe it was not intended as such. The acutal events present a much stronger story.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|a little different from the books but still a good vampire series, can't wait to get the next season...and the one after that
B006JN5KBG|4.0|I was 15 when this came out and it was during that time when slashers were no longer in vogue and Hollywood started doing these inane and insulting horror-comedy hybrids.. This was one of the better ones and it worked well..<br /><br />It's also interesting to note the scenes with Amanda Bearse acting sexually frigid seems interesting now, considering she came out 10 years later.. and due to a sagging mainstream career after 976 Evil (1989), Stephen Geoffreys hit the gym and switched to making hardcore gay xxx porn (after he came out).. Now where's the E! True Hollywood Story on this one??  Anyway, Fright Night is a good 80's flick... the sequel, not so great..<br /><br />I purchased the DVD back in 2006, when Sony had updated and remastered it in High Def... It doesn't look half bad on my Blu Ray, and it's sold, here, on Amazon, for like $10.00..NEW. Yes, I know, it only has the Original Theatrical Trailer, and it's \\"JUST\\" in Dolby surround sound (for you perfectionists).. BUT I don't care, 'cause I'm not paying $350+ for ANY movie. Especially one still readily available on DVD.. (Twilight Ltd Edition\\"numbered\\" Blu Ray). I pitty da fool who buys it for that price. Ha!
B0094M4R3Q|4.0|It is getting harder and harder to find good movies to look at. This one fit the bill nicely. Loved the humor and the plot. Great for whole family
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is a fun game that my daughter and I play together.  It also helps pass the time when I'm bored at work.  Really enjoy this game.
B0025UHKNS|4.0|Very good product.<br />Easy to use and no so expensive.<br />I can complain with it. Really good.<br /> Many thanks Garmin.
B000EXZDOQ|5.0|In my opinion, there is only one other album by Whitesnake that I feel is better than \\"Ready & Willing\\" and that is \\"Slide it In!\\"  Forget the hair band days for Coverdale & Co., this is where it is at. The version of 'Fool for Your Loving\\" on this album/cd has much more depth and soul in it than the 1989 version.<br />Are you \\"Ready and Willing\\" because this will be an \\"E\\" ticket for any snake fan on a Friday/Saturday with good friends, a camp fire and a cool one to ease the tension of any workweek!
B008X9Z37A|5.0|Very nice kindle cover.  Easy to hold and fits in my purse.  I take it everywhere I go.<br />Thank you.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|super fun super cute love everything about it awesome game cannot be any better than this.  I don't believe this could be better
0345529057|5.0|Just a great read! I would recommend these books to any of my friends.Try them yourself and see what I mean.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|I was very excited to buy this game. Scribblenauts games are awesome! This game has a major flaw, rendering it unplayable. On several devices (my GSIII, a flagship device) there is no way to create items. I type something into the generator box, and then nothing happens at all. I can't get past the tutorial. Fix this please so I can play the game i bought!
B00867GK26|5.0|The bluray DVD combo is fantastic. I play it in my car for my kids or any person riding in the back seats, instant effect, I can see their faces of complete joy.
B00CDT41RY|1.0|Very disappointing to spend money on amazon instant video credit only to have them bill you for the movie, then leave your credit to sit.  Great way to completely turn someone off from amazon video who was starting to use it a lot.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|I was really enjoying this app. I'm a huge MLP fan and when this app was released for the kindle fire it was super excited.  The reason for the low rating is because after playing for over 2 months and yes spending a decent chunk of money on inapp purchases the game suddenly restarted and I lost all my progress. I don't know if this was a random bug or something with my Kindle Fire but I'm extremely disappointed and frustrated.
0316228532|5.0|The book arrived on time, well wrapped and in very good condition. The Casual Vacancy is a very well written book with lots of turns and twists! I would expect nothing less of J.K. Rowlings after the Harry Potter books.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|More like the old school click and point games and while it still included hidden object scenes there were great mini games and a nice story to make for a very enjoyable game.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|The DVD's arrived well packaged, on time and in good shape. I have enjoyed every last minute of Downton Abbey. I can not wait for season 4 to start!
B00881PTRC|5.0|I love this version. The first option with the little animated victim is my favorite. Many categories to suit anyone's skill and preference.  Perhaps neatest of all is the multilingual options. My high school son is learning Spanish and he got a kick out of playing this.
B004EWEX9Y|5.0|Apple is Apple, great to connect my iPod to other devices, I use it a lot at parties and gatherings. Very good, thank you.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I like the different challenges it gives you. It keeps it from getting boring. And I also like the story that they are telling on the side.
B008PQ8XZK|5.0|Kate Morton, as always does not disapoint.<br />She creates interesting characters as always, and takes them through life with a brilliant twist!
0062238868|4.0|Not insightful politically, but it is worth reading.  Chris Kyle was clearly very good at what he did, and he was very brave.  I also recently read the SEAL book by the author who wrote the Hunt For Osama Bin Laden.  They cover some of the same turf, but that author was not a sniper like Chris Kyle.<br /><br />He may lose some readers with a few things.<br />1) He killed hundreds of Iraqis, and I and a lot of other Americans still don't really understand the Iraq war. President Bush invaded Iraq because they had WMDs that posed a clear and present danger to America, but after we were there we didn't find any WMDs. At the end of the day, once the President has made the decision to deploy you, you need to do everything you can to kill people who are trying to kill you and your fellow soldiers, and Chris Kyle makes that point over and over.  I fully understand that and admire his courage.<br />2) He always referred to the Iraqi enemy soldiers as \\"savages\\".  He was a SEAL and not a diplomat so I can forgive him for that, but it definitely affects the tone of the book.  A lot of the people he was fighting against would admittedly kill women and children in a heart beat, so it is easy to understand where he was coming from.  I still think the book could have benefited from him simply referring to the enemy with the term \\"insurgents\\" or something similar.<br />3) He claims that he punched out a person that he refers to with a pseudonym, and later says on the radio that the person is Jesse Ventura.  Jesse Ventura sues Chris Kyle and says he was lying.  I have no idea who is lying so I guess it is just a case of \\"he said / she said\\" (or he said / he said I guess), and now we may never know what happened.<br />4) The last chapter of the book talks about how he tried to help vets with his hunting trips.  I admire him for trying to help wounded veterans.  It is very sad that it ended up the way that it did.  In hindsight, allowing someone who is less than one week out of a mental hospital access to a firearm was a bad decision, however, Chris Kyle was trying to help wounded veterans and his heart was in the right place.<br /><br />Overall, the book was an exciting read.  I definitely admire his skill and his bravery.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|A great read for history buff. Beyond expectations. A must have in every personal library. Wish I could have met them.
B00CIOMQ4Y|5.0|MY ENTIRE LIBRARY IS GONE! BRING IT BACK!  I PAID FOR SEASON 8 OF SUPERNATURAL, WAS WATCHING THIS WHEN IT FROZE AND EVERYTHING WAS GONE!-JACKIE MUSGROVE
B00881PTRC|5.0|I downloaded this app when it was the FREE APP OF THE DAY. I like to try new apps. Plus my daughter and I love to play against each other in hangman. I love the little doodle dude, sometimes I mess up just to see what he will do next. Must have app for the hangman enthusiast. I have tried a lot of hangman apps and this one is the BEST by far.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I don't use the app often only because I don't have a big need for online storage.  I run this on my PC, all my Kindles, and my phone.  I like the idea of having my notes available at all times.  I like the format.  I think it is impressive and easy to use.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|My favorite TV show on air now and possibly ever. No way i can give it less then 5 stars
B007MAETA8|3.0|I'm sorry to say this bc I am such a huge john Mayer fan but born and raised failed to meet my expectations...let me just say I have adored everything by john in the past...like every song he's ever done..but his work on john Mayer trio was prob my fav!!! Love the jazzy blues on john..it's a good look for him and no one can match his guitar skills.  I've een him in concert a handful of times and prefer his live cds also..like his double CD in house of blues from LA. Oh how I love &#34;in your atmosphere&#34;. Anyways this CD left me feeling mundane at best. I mean don't get me wrong his voice is amazing and the songs aren't awful..I think maybe it was the fact I felt he didn't sound like he was feeling anything he was singing about..just kind of singing these ok songs...I miss that raw emotion..even in his early days.. circa room for squares...he gave us all he had in him...<br /><br />With the exception of &#34;Walt grace&#34; a song that breathes the true john in it..the song that made me cry for this character he was singing about..the rest feels just fluff..nothing to sing about...or sing to..<br /><br />I'm giving it three stars because it is still john and the songs aren't horrible..and &#34;Walt grace&#34; is beautiful..but I find the rest to b simple background noise..sigh.
B000SEJHRA|1.0|This book was selected for a book club due to its reviews as being humorous. I'm not sure who reported it as humorous, but they obviously don't have much sensitivity to a true sense of humor. It's full of bad concepts, bad language, bad grammar, bad illustrations, bad ideology, and is just plain bad.
B004QZ9PLU|3.0|This book is absolutely fantastic! It will tug at your heartstrings and keep your hope of true love alive throughout the entire thing!
B00B6QXN56|5.0|Every minute of both the CDs is excellent music. If you like rock/blues acoustic guitar mixed with vocals, you will love this CD set.
0385344228|5.0|That's the question which haunts the pages of William Landay's Defending Jacob.  Andy Barber appears to have it all: a great career as an assistant D.A. in a small and wealthy Massachusetts town, a solid marriage with a wonderful wife, and a 14 year old son named Jacob to whom he is passionately devoted.  It is easy for Andy to ignore the fact that he is the son and grandson of notorious murderers, about whom he rarely thinks and has not even told his wife.  But then one day the murder of a 14 year old boy shocks the town.  As the investigation goes on signs begin to lead to Jacob's possible and then probable guilt.  Andy and his wife Laurie devote themselves to defending their son, even though Laurie begins to have doubts as the case goes on.  Eventually the case takes a surprising turn, and then another and another. Andy's buried past and heritage resurrect themselves, and he must ponder how well he knows his family and himself.<br /><br />This is a superb thriller with a lot of fascinating information on the legal process. I found it difficult to guess where the storyline was going and was surprised, sometimes shockingly so, by some of the twists and turns in the plotline. Landay writes smoothly and clearly and knows how to explain some obscure legal maneuvers so that laymen understand them.  Defending Jacob made quite an impression on me, and I will long remember Andy Barber and the dilemmas he and his family faced.
B0006GAI6Y|4.0|I recently started ballroom dance lessons before deploying so a movie dealing with dance is interesting to me. Since it was inexpensive, and I'm in Afghanistan, AND Amazon ships here, I bought it. Some critics didn't like the movie but I did.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Crazy me prefers to pay for the episodes to watch without commercials.  This was one of those series that had to be purchased.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|When I got it I was just like wow it's amazing my new fav game! All my friends love it it's so ADDICTING I recommend u should get it it's so nice to discover new species of animals :)
1608871045|5.0|Fun to read, and the included stuff makes it a blast :) Well worth the buy, and a great gift for that Dark Knight fan in your life. Focuses on the newest trilogy, you should note.
0756405890|5.0|I can't believe there are so many negative reviews for this book. I honestly think people just get their jollies by trying to rip apart a perfectly excellent book.<br /><br />I've been studying creative writing for 5 years now, and this is the first thing I've read and enjoyed since starting the drudgery of analyzing novels. Almost every book I've picked up since has fallen to pieces--even books I had previously loved. This book didn't.<br /><br />This book is masterful in its execution. Yes, it's not Harry Potter. It's Harry Potter for adults that understand the world is more complex than that.<br /><br />Compliments to the author. I think any aspiring writer would be proud to call this their debut novel.
0439023491|5.0|A stunning follow-up to The Hunger Games. Highly imaginative, completely engrossing, and with enough surprises that I was never even close to bored. It was easy to read 200 pages in one sitting. Definitely looking forward to the finale in Mockingjay!
B0037NB6QE|5.0|I love this group of people.  I get so involved with the story.  I look forward to the next book .
B00B4804KS|5.0|My review pertains to the quality of 3D:<br /><br />As someone who loves home theater 3D, I have probably every major 3D Blu-ray release, and I'm pretty sure this tops them all.<br /><br />Literally every scene has been remastered for 3D conversion, and it shows.  Its a beautiful, fun, and awesomely entertaining 3D showpiece.  Exceeded my expectations in every way.<br /><br />Also, the \\"Extras\\" has an overview of how they spent 9 months transferring the source material to 3D.  You really can't go wrong with Jurassic Park 3D.. get it now.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|This was a powerfully descriptive look into North Korea during my lifetime. It's almost unbelievable how much these people have endured and survived in this Communist regime. It's even more incredible that a government can keep it's population so shut off from the rest of the world in the developing age of technology. I will recommend this book to my family and friends!
B00AB0Z88S|2.0|This review pertains to the 3D version of Life of Pi.<br /><br />First off, do not purchase this for the 3D.  I was really shocked at how little 3D there actually was in this film, especially considering all of the hype around this being \\"the next Avatar\\".  I own probably every major 3D Blu-ray release, and this was a huge disappointment.  It was like \\"3D\\" was just slapped on the cover as an afterthought, and no effort went in to the transfer of the source material to Blu-ray 3D.<br /><br />Other movies like Jurassic Park 3D, Prometheus 3D, and even in Men in Black 3D blow this away in the quality of the visuals.
B0073COMKW|5.0|Nice bulb.  Replaced a 60w incandescent flood in a recessed can in my bathroom and this bulb is brighter.  Really lights up the bathroom.<br />I bought the warm white 3000k bulb. It's a little whiter than the old bulb, but not glaring.  I like it.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|I have other music players, but Amazon mp3 is the easiest to use. I would recommend it to others. Thanks
0762445262|4.0|I expected this to be tiny, and it is. But it actually works, and my 6-yr old son is thrilled. We've added several of the &#34;Super Hero&#34; items to his Lego &#34;City&#34; collection, and we're slowly turning his &#34;City&#34; into Gotham City. This bat signal is now sitting atop his Lego City Police Station - perfect for Commissioner Gordon, who now inhabits the upper floor office :-). When we switch it on, it casts a nicely visible bat signal on the wall. Very cool!
B000025QLX|3.0|I did choose this rate because i thought the pack of the cd will include the little cards of art that it supposed to be in it, thats why i bought it in the first place and i felt kinda dissapointed. Would you please let me know if any NO CODE cd has the little cards i mentioned?<br />Thank You
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|At first, I didn't know if I could read this novel. But the hints at child abuse mostly remained just that, hints. I could not get through graphic details of such sins. The story of the grown James was sad at times, and yet a bit humorous. I really loved the \\"Rose\\" character, and the description of her country home. It made me wonder why James didn't realize that he was loved by Rose and Paddy. But then the ending wouldn't have been as dramatic!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Ran across this book at my local library and decided to give a try - I'm so glad I did.  I remember the video game arcades of the '80s, though I didn't spend much time in them, nor do I play any of the MMO games today.  But as a plot premise for this novel, these two game genres meshed perfectly.  I found the book well written, with characters I enjoyed spending time with.  Others here have done plot summaries, so I won't bother.  But when I finished this book I immediately looked to see what else this author had written because I want more!  I'm looking forward to Ernest Cline's next novel.
0062059963|3.0|I read this book in just two days, so it's a quick read. I kept waiting for the action to get started and the plot to develop further, which it never really did. I like the concept for this book and the love triangle but the characters were a little flat for me. For a romance, I felt it lacked intensity and passion. The entire book is spent with America waffling back and forth between Aspen and Maxon. It's an enjoyable enough read but it doesn't have much substance. Also, the kindle price is a little high for the length of the book and quality.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Love it..Like the first season, it is wonderful!!! The show speaks for itself. Superb acting, directing and cinematography. A must see.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This is such a cute amazing game.I do agree that I wish you didn't have t<br />o spend real  money. But a very fun educational game. I LOVE it!!!
B00005JLEU|1.0|We borrowed \\"spirited away\\" from a friend and loved it so much we decided to buy a copy for library.  Since we had just seen it, when it arrived we put it in the bookshelf for future use.  When we got it out to watch several months later it played part way through and then froze.  It freezes at the same spot on multiple dvd machines.  We can not watch the whole thing.  Upon closer inspection the disc appears to have been resurfaced.  It has wavy buffing marks.  We didn't think to inspect the disc and test it out since the seller said it was \\"like new\\".  We will next time.  Learned this lesson the hard way. When I emailed the seller they had a real snotty attitude and said \\"its been too long, you should have inspected it right away.  But how about a coupon for 10% off of your next purchase?\\"  Sorry altezahun there will be no next purchase from your company!
B00BHMF578|4.0|You will not be disappointed with this movie. And if your old enough to remember these events it brings back memories of the 70's and early 80's.
B00AQM8H9I|1.0|DO NOT GET THIS APP IT WILL GET STUCK AND IT DOSEN'T download AT ALL. IM HELPING YOU DO NOT GET THIS APP!
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|The trailer was pretty funny and makes you want to see the movie. But the actual movie spins slowly toward predictable plots and endings. A few funny scenes.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I went from a standard mouse to this gaming mouse.  I was attracted to the lower cost and programmable buttons.  I was curious if the extra buttons would improve my diablo iii experience.<br /><br />The software is easy to use.  The dpi selection/sensitivity works well.  The extra buttons have come in handy.<br /><br />It was a solid purchase.
B00BF123WG|5.0|Bigelow shows once again her superior movie making and how she gets details right. Starts out a little slow but it is painting a good picture of how this all happened. Watch the 60 minutes interview with the navy seal then watch the movie. The stories are one in the same.
B0063IH60K|5.0|love this game. It is very addictive. I have spent many hours and lost myself in time playing. Easy to learn
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|In these times, when overwhelming cynicism and rejection of the values of the older generation runs rampant, it is emotionally fulfilling and almost cathartic to watch a film such as this. A very simple and beautiful message is delivered; A society can be judged and measured by the degree to which it protects and fosters the dignity of the elderly, and creates a context in which they can hold onto a creative, human identity, rather than what is done to our elderly today, which is, to be thrown into a Nursing home, overmedicated, and treated like a side of beef on Metamucil, to be gotten out of the way, and hastened into the next world, so that the living can inherit their money, and the politicians get away with cutting the budget which is allowing them to \\"live too long\\", at too high a cost. As long as people live, they have within them a spark of beauty, and goodness, that makes every breath they take and every minute they live a precious gift. Why shouldn't every senior citizen home have music, and celebrate the life of Giuseppe Verdi? Dustin Hoffman, who is now 75, directs this beautiful film as a understated but forceful reminder that every life is a life worth living, especially those like the aged who are marginalized to a degree that is frightening. Verdi lived and composed late into life, til his 90's. Ironically, some of the most beautiful creations of musical art were the gifts of the man who in today's United Kingdom, (the setting for this movie) would be put into hospice against his will, given Morphine, and starved to death by the British Health system to save money, years before he was done composing.<br />This movie hits home. I can see my own parents and grandparents as if they were actors in this film. I want more from Dustin Hoffman. Bravo!! Encore!!!!
0671646788|5.0|Great book, I suggest it in order to change if one desire it, the usual pathways to think and feel
B003L77G10|5.0|The writing for The Good Wife never disappoints, and neither does the acting. I'm not one for watching TV but this show is worth every second. The plots are rich and full of twists and turns. The cast is the best on television. Season 2 is particularly interesting because of the sub plot with Kalinda and Blake. The beautiful, outrageously talented Archie Panjabi steals the thunder. She has created a mysterious character that has shadows and shades, which entice viewers to remain loyal.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Nicholas sparks never fails to suck me into his novels and break my heart each time. Always a bittersweet ending, but truly another wonderful love story by him.
B004N6369Y|3.0|Danielle Steel's books are wonderful, although this one lacked the in depth of the characters that is usually in her books, I got bored with the book.
B004QOB8SY|5.0|OMG, this is the best series I have ever seen of Sherlock franchise.  The stories are so well written and the acting is outstanding.  I can't wait to see Season 3.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|This game is pretty easy when you first start, but the enemies become stronger as you go, making for a challenging game in no time.
B009AMANH4|5.0|Even tho' there have been other movies over the years about the greatest president that this country has ever seen, none can measure up to this stellar rendition of a part of his life!!!  Perfect actors, perfect director and producer...how could you go wrong!!!  I whole-heartedly recommend this movie for every history buff, and lover of everything Abe!!!
B00BWJARHO|4.0|When I first saw this movie in theaters I was disappointed. I didn't hate it immediately, but I was disappointed. As time wore on I began to think more and more about the parts I hated and eventually it got so bad it gave me a couple nightmares- of it being worse than it was.<br />I decided to watch it again, with now lower expectations, in the interest of giving it a fair shake. And honestly, I liked it much better the second time.<br />There are parts I still don't like, and I feel like the movie really suffers from a lack of direction, and particularly not really knowing who its main character is. In the Lord of the Rings it worked much better when they followed separate stories of Aragorn, Frodo, and Merry & Pippin. In the Hobbit I would have much preferred for the focus to be on, well- the hobbit.<br />That said, I think the scenes that do focus on Bilbo, particularly the beginning, and the Riddles scene are brilliant.<br />For the most part the rest is learning to take the good with the bad and deal with what you have.<br />I would recommend watching it once or probably twice before condemning this film entirely.
B005LAIHZE|5.0|I highly recommend this fantasy about the GREATEST President that this country has ever seen, and this movie makes him even more of a super hero!!!  Ingenious!!!
0345529057|5.0|No question that for the price this 4 book set was well worth it and met all my expectations.  I would absolutely recommend this purchase to others!!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|its a great game you can relax to without wasting your brain on simpler things. i really enjoy it. cheers
B00338QENI|3.0|I thought the book was a must read. It did shed some light on a lot of different cancers, treatments, and how for over 50 years doctors have worked hard to try to find a cure. It however was a hard read for me for a few reasons. One I hate to see people mistreated or taken advantage of. Two back when racism was this in your face was a tough time to re-live. Three at some point you just got tired of hearing the medical terms etc. All in all I think the author did a great job gathering the facts and putting this book together. Can't wait to hear if this story is a to be continued!!!
1451696191|5.0|I saw this movie and was pleasantly surprised. The book is also very good! I would recommend reading the book and seeing the movie!
B000085RPU|1.0|Purchased Who Framed Roger Rabbit and the disc didn't work. It was supposed to be brand new but I could tell that it wasn't, just re-wrapped. I have sent the DVD back for reimbursement and as soon as I either receive a working movie or my refund my complaint will stay on here. I had to pay shipping twice now. Very inconvenient.
0374533571|5.0|I read the book before seeing the movie. The book is a bit different than the movie, but both are great!
B00AECGQF2|5.0|It is a very good game to play. You can dye the hair many ways.I love playing it.I hope you can also have fun.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|This really is a great show, especially for television. It is about serial killers and is a bit graphic, but the story line is very interesting.
B000FC2KL0|5.0|I've always loved RHCP.  Especially the lyrics.  But this would be a good read for those who have struggled with any form of addiction or those who are trying to save an addict ( it gives you a great perspective of the reasoning behind their actions).
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great tool to have on my kindle fire. The display  bright and colorful, not to mention huge!
B000BISBDY|4.0|I was never a fan of country music in general or Johnny Cash in particular.  I'd heard a few of his hits, and liked his distinctive voice, but wasn't moved to buy his music.  Then I heard the song &#34;Hurt&#34; at the end of the movie &#34;Colombiana&#34;, and had one of those &#34;Oh my...who IS this??? What is this song??? I MUST HAVE THIS SONG&#34;  moments.  You know the kind.  Where you feel as if you can't live until you have a song (movie, book, whatever) in your possession so that you can lose yourself in it whenever you like?  Yeah, it was like that.  I was astonished (to put it mildly) when I found that the aching, emotion-filled, gorgeous baritone voice that made me hang on every note was none other than Johnny Cash.  And thus, I bought this record, based on the strength of my reaction to that one song.  It's a good compilation of his work, many familiar songs even for someone like me who wasn't already a fan.  But the one song I love the most is still the one I play over and over.  It's quite different from many of his songs, in the wrenching emotional honesty and pain that he shares.  I like the CD, but I LOVE that song.  If you're someone like me, with very eclectic and varied musical taste, I recommend you give Mr. Cash a listen.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|I was concerned because some of the reviews said it wouldn't work with a Kindle Fire. But it does! Huzzah!
B005OK721G|5.0|Do you ever just buy a movie without knowing anything about it?  I do, and often get burned as you may imagine.  I chose to buy &#34;Columbiana&#34; because I admired other films that starred Zoe Saldana (notably &#34;Avatar&#34;); and because I liked the movie &#34;Taken&#34; which had the same writer.  Oh, and also because it was a cheap price!  I really enjoyed this film.  It's just enough &#34;over the top&#34; to be entertaining, with a strong female lead character that may put you in mind of the likes of Sigourney Weaver in &#34;Aliens&#34;, to name just one other &#34;strong female&#34; lead.  The pacing is perfect, the story kept me interested despite it mostly being a vehicle for &#34;action&#34; scenes.  If you liked Aliens, the Fifth Element, and other action/fantasy films, you'll like this one.
1616550414|5.0|Item was a gift, and the recipient loves it! Very pretty illustrations, and the cover is gorgeous. The timeline logic is a bit flimsy, but it's awesome that they canonized it. Huzzah!
B008J34466|5.0|This is a great showcase album for a singer at the top of her game.  The songs are varied in content and style...some a little raunchy, some pure &#34;pop&#34;.  This was my first &#34;Pink&#34; album, and I play it all the time in the car.  I enjoy her unique voice, as well as her &#34;just one of the regular people&#34; approach to lyrics.  Pink doesn't put on airs...she doesn't need to.  Her gift is a wonderful instrument that allows her to soar one minute and be gritty the next, and always spot on for pitch and inflection.  You'll like this CD.
B00992CF6W|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER! Sure it cost 6.99 but it's the best game for kindle fire because the kindle has a large screen. The three things that I don't like about the game is that it doesn't connect to a WiFi game if you gave the full version and someone else has the free version. The second one is it doesn't let you make the nether portal and go into the nether world.  The third thing is that it doesn't let you pause the game or change the skin of your character. Other than those three things this game is totally worth the 6.99 dollars.<br />GREAT GAME
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|I am not the avid racer, but having a blast playing .... great way to pass the time but I am also supposed to be in bed by now..... just one more race.... I promise!!!
B005NJU8PA|2.0|This book begins well, and seems to offer an innovative approach to learning, but rapidly descends into a series of anecdotes disguising the fact that it really has very little that is new to offer when it comes to learning, training, or growing as a human being.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|These books keep getting better and better. The story is well written and not predictable at all which is also great.
B008YW5RH2|5.0|Totally enjoying this app....try it...if you don't like it, just delete it.... certain you'd love it and have tons of fun too!!!!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Loved it! Very unique game, not for the lazy. So different from any game I've played so far. Challenging puzzles, had to use the hints.
159420411X|1.0|nate silver talks about himself too much...he does not know as much as he thinks he does and he never hesitates to use ten words when one would do.  unreadable
B000UZNRS2|5.0|All the twists and turns make for good reading. It left readers wondering what happened to Oliver after story ended.
0763644765|5.0|My 18 month old son adores this book. He loves the character and relates to the baby in the story easily. Love all of her books!
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|I like that you put a picture of the cheese and it made the cheese touch start.<br />  Hunter Ryan Taylor
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book was awesome. What if your child did the unthinkable? What would life be like for you? How would you feel about it? What if your father, grandfather and family line was one of violence that you refused to admit to or acknowledge? Landay deftly explores these hard questions in Defending Jacob. He doesn't try to wrap the book up neatly or easily give out the 'whys'. He makes his reader question and arrive at conclusions, and he will keep you hooked until the last page.
B0009XT8YW|5.0|My favourite album in the world. Ever. This is Babs at her best. This digitally remastered copy is brilliant and you can turn it up loud.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|Could stand to not cost so much. still a cute game though. It would be better if you didn't need Internet to open it too.
B0063GORYU|5.0|this is a wonderful app and the ability to play without Internet makes it better. as someone who pulls out the kindle to play games any time I can I appreciate the quick play and responsiveness
B00756GRUE|5.0|The watch offers everything you need in a timepiece.  Easy to operate and stylish.  The bezel's numbers are easy to read at depth.  Highly recommended!
B005TMSN4E|5.0|Now I can use my big zoom lens from my old D90 on my Nikon 1 v2; double the reach of the 10-100 N-1 zoom. Works fine with the V2; build is robust and surprisingly heavy. Not a toy-like adapter. Definitely worth the money if you have old lenses from DSLR's.
0547884591|5.0|I was gifted 4HB by my mom and step dad and I absolutely love it. Timothy Ferris's writing style is so laid back and fun to read. His mad scientist approach to every experiment in the book is so awesomely refreshing. I can't help but to mention all the chuckles I got from his stories behind every experiment. I have tested myself with many of his techniques such as the \\"slow carb\\" diet and adding kettle bells to my work out and I have lost over 25 pounds in less than two months. Really his advice is fun and so simple. I am a wife and a mother of three I work full time and go to school if I can find time to read this book and better myself anyone can!! Tim you are fantastico!!!! Thank you for all your work and can't wait to meet you some day you are truly a life changer! Thank you Thank you Thank you
B0091THRCU|3.0|It´s a good product, the problem is that you have to interact with the case every time that you are going to use the phone.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's great because it's simple, easy to use, and FREE!!! I'd definitely recommend it to anyone. GREAT APP FOR SCHOOL USAGE!!!!!
B000R296VK|1.0|does not work on dvd player, ruined some little boys birthday.  On item description, information was missing of playing on only some dvd players.
B000001F9E|5.0|i liked the hole cd--i would like to find another cd with the song running back on it. if you know of one please let me know
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Different than his other books. Well written. Didn't want to put down. I think it is one of his best.
B003NX75B8|5.0|A lovely book that absolutely embraces the feeling of teens everywhere. What does it take to be a friend? What does it take to fall in love and stay that way? A moving tribute to knowing who you are and celebrating it. To discovering who u might get be and taking that risk to finding yourself.<br /><br />It took a while to fall in love with the book and characters, but once I did I never wanted it to end.
B000GCFD72|5.0|This book was awesome!  I recommend it to everyone I know!  It challenged my thinking and really made me improve my parenting I think.  I love it!
B007KUFDBY|4.0|One of my daughter's favorite Disney movies though it's never gotten much recognition.  Its a pretty well done movie and of course Blu-Ray enhances the experience even more.  I would recommend it as a good family movie which is fairly close to the original &#34;Treasure Island&#34;
1934030597|5.0|I am an experienced mechanic but you can always teach an old dog new tricks.  Written in a way I think a total novice can understand.  I have challenged my girl friend to read it, so I will update this when she does.  She doesn't even know how to change a tire so it will be interesting to hear her feedback.<br /><br />Charles
B00A0MJA1I|4.0|My wife's favorite Disney movie.  Blu-Ray enhances the sounds and visual experience even more!  A terrific family movie and highly recommended
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|it's not a bad game it keeps my son busy for a while and that was all I was expecting
B004ZN9RWK|4.0|I have the vinyl LP but bought the CD to play in the car and garage.  The CD is good but I wish they hadn't put gaps between the tracks where there were none on the vinyl.
B00A757EFW|3.0|it's not a bad game it keeps my son busy for a while and that was all I was expecting
B002361MLA|5.0|This book made do much sense in a confusing sort of way.  It was almost like your being should be in a constant  state of non reaction.  Just  letting things roll off your back.  Never getting upset about anything.  Which could be great if it were that easy.  We're not robots here.
B005HSL626|3.0|it's not a bad game it keeps my son busy for a while and that was all I was expecting
B004T0XYM8|5.0|This film, along with Once Upon a Time in America are the pinnacle of Sergio Leone's carrier - a brilliant director and film maker.  Leone studied the best western films for two years and incorporated the best scenes from each in this one brilliant film.  The complex (and enjoyable) story and the complex (and brilliant) filming combine to make this a classic.<br /><br />For anyone who enjoys a good western, or just an excellent film, this should be in your collection.  Simply the best western ever made.
B00002N9ER|5.0|If you like what you see, you will like what you get.  A little warning, if your Maglite does not have a rough surface part on the handle be aware that the Maglite my slide around in the brackets.  This can however be solved by placing tiny rubber stickies at the base of the brackets.  I mounted in my jeep and adds some fun rugged dimension to your vehicle.
B005D0RDKW|5.0|I have several concert/musicals on BluRay, and this is by far the best of them. The picture is super sharp; it helps that the concert stage was well lit (since, often everything outside a spotlight is dark) and I can see detail the audience probably couldn't. There's a bit of banding that shows up whenever the lights directly hit the camera, but otherwise, it's near perfect.<br />The sound is presented in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and sounds much better than quite a few Live recorded CDs I have. It's well balanced for an immersive feel. It's not perfect, but I feel its 'flaws' lend to the feeling of being at a real concert.<br />If you like RUSH, you'll love this disc. If you only know Moving Pictures, this will expose you to a few songs you may not be familiar with (and you will be a better person for it).<br />Make sure you have your air guitar warmed up and ready; you'll be playing it (even if you never admit to it).
B00002N9ER|5.0|My Maglites were never where I wanted them.<br />No longer a problem.<br />The lights are easy to snap in and out of the clamps, even for wife with small hands.
B00AQM8H9I|4.0|This developer understands how a fame should work. Very cool concept, takes some intelligence to play,  and has nice graphics and sound. It's not too complicated but would be nice to give some basic strategy along with instructions. Trial and error cab take care of that but maybe strategy hints for sale? Nice work.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Why wait? This is a great DVD to own and enjoy in the comfort of your own home or on the plane.
B001CDLAT4|5.0|When you watch this film, you will feel included in the<br />lives of the peoples of the world.  You  cannot watch as<br />an outsider.  The issues it raises, without any words, and<br />the compassion it stirs, with only a camera and music,<br />may well change your views forever.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|What more can you really say?  The Lion King on bluray - good picture and sound quality as it should be from Disney.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is awesome. I love it so much. It's a great way to past the time. User friendly and so much yo do,  you'll never get bored.
B007T7MIR0|5.0|Great app for viewing files while on the go.  Use if for MS Office, .pdf files and more.<br /><br />Great way to keep my transit schedules handy and other personal data.
0451418433|4.0|I had a difficult time putting this book down. I will be looking forward anxiously to the third volume of the trilogy.
B004EF65QA|5.0|This series was done right.  I fell in love with the story as well as the characters.  This one is up there with the BBC Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth.
B005GFPZYK|1.0|I got some 30 or so pages into the book and found it boring. I was hoping for some insight but it was't there. The author was obviously a flag-waving soldier that didn't really reflect on what he was doing. He just wanted to be a soldier. The book may have gotten &#34;better&#34; further into it but I have to many books to read that pull me in, right off, first page. So, I pulled it from my Kindle library. I'll never know if there was a hidden jewel buried somewhere in the pulp of the publication.
B000VNMMR0|5.0|used but in great condition.  the premise is so good that those in government and all financial institutions should have this as REQUIRED VIEWING since they intend to make all purchases digital in the future
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I really enjoy playing this game but I have some issues with credits I have been shorted both within the game and not getting them transferred to me from the Amazon App Store into the game. I have been shorted at least 248 credits, 235 of which cost me $19.99. I have contacted your support site several times and sent them all of the information that they requested. Still haven't received my credits. This makes it very expensive to play the game.
B007REW8DO|5.0|Love this cd. I play it all the time. I've had a few family members ask where they could get this.
B002JVWR54|5.0|I was excited when a second season was scheduled and then let down when the show ended after this season.  It is another great show by Joss Whedon that is a must for true fans.
B002OQT928|4.0|I Love Ice Age,  Would have gone higher but I already had this one and did not know it.<br /><br />I am starting to think that these reviews are not what I thought they were.  Sorry more than one more word.
0792844890|5.0|Family really enjoyed this comedy. It was really funny and has been watched frequently. A great edition to our collection
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love this alarm clock. I can set it to be loud and impossible to ignore or set it to softly and gently awaken me. I usually choose the latter, but it's nice to have the annoying choice available. it never fails. I love it.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|First book starts out kinda slow then you are hooked! Just be aware they are long books and once you start you don't want to put them down.
B005R32L66|5.0|Ok plssssssssssssssss text meeee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! @ lovesyoubaby1231 ok ok ok!!!!!! Im on every day so text me!! Thanks alot baby!! :) :) :) ohh yea greatest app ever!!! :):)
B00BFD8AJE|5.0|Great album ! Great songs with Hooks , melody . A great Hardrock album from PRETTY MAIDS indeed !  If you like this , also check out / buy the albums from MAGNITUDE 9 Here on Amazon Mp3 .
1452101248|2.0|I like the selection of recipes, but i have to take them and tweak it to be a lot less oily...a good vegetarian recipe book but not the best for a plant strong life style.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|This book was great! I have been waiting for it since book one came out and was worth the wait. I just can't wait for book three now.
0345803493|1.0|Wow. I thought the first was bad. This one is worse. Nothing happens. Except a lot of gasping. And blushing. And flushing. And frowning.<br /><br />I got my hopes up when the helicopter went missing. But that lasted all of two pages. What a letdown.
B008393Q2O|5.0|This is one nifty app to have.  You can customize each note color to the kind of list/note you want (like one color could be for appointments and another one could be for to-do lists, etc.).  Also, you can set reminders for the different notes/lists.  When you complete an item on the list, you can just go to that list/note and check it off and it will draw a line through the item like a real list.  A must have for those of you who like to make lists and write notes to yourself.  :)
B002VPE1AW|5.0|The plot was great and was carried out in excellent fashion.<br />Characters were nicely portrayed in a realistic fashion.<br />Awesome graphics presentations.
B004T32SOK|1.0|I thought this was &#34;Dropbox&#34; before I realized what it really was.  I since uninstalled it from my Kindle and from my Cloud.  I like &#34;Dropbox&#34; better.  Now if I can just figure out how to cancel my Box account, I'd be really happy.  Anyone know?
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Character casting was excellent. Dialog was entertaining as was the suspenseful execution of plot.<br />Marin, Willis and others were a great team!
B000NDIAWY|5.0|see above...WHAT CAN I SAY? IT'S TERRIFIC...IT GROWS ON YOU (THE WHOLE CD).  I LOVED &#34;THE STORY&#34; IN &#34;THE LUCKY ONE&#34;.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|It downloaded just fine, but it wouldn't install.  It said that there was too little space on my drive.  I went through and deleted a bunch if apps, leaving enough for the game.  It still wouldn't install.  It said the same thing.  I've played on DS and love the game, but this app needs to be fixed on Kindle Fire.  It was a waste of 99 cents.
1400034205|5.0|I first read this book in college in a Brit. Lit class. It has remained my favorite book for nearly a decade. I have recommended it to any person I care about because I want to talk to them about the story, characters, and themes that are relevant and timeless to any age. I always say when I give it as a gift that it starts a bit slow in the first few chapters but read to the 6th or 7th chapter and you will be hooked. Beautifully written and a compelling story.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My nephews (ages 4 and 13) and my niece (age 6) all love this game. It's easy for them to control and it keeps them occupied. I would definitely recommend getting it if not for kids for yourself as a time killer. :3
B000LTAY1U|4.0|This item is slick. My son thought it was cool and asked for it.  Maybe I can catch it at this price or cheaper again.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|this is the best app evahhhh! please buy it because if you do you will be very happy. it is sooooo worth it! I hope my review helped you and enjoy the game!
034580404X|5.0|This book collection is the bomb!!!!  You will need a fan while reading it......lol.  Great price for the whole set.
B005R32L66|5.0|I have used skype app on Android platform for over  2 years. I have used phone calls using skype on Nexus One from airports, video calls using skype from HP Touchpad Ice Cream Sandwich, Kindle Fire and Galaxy Note II. I used for meetings for over 2 hours and video clarity was amazing on HP Touchpad. Overall skype is excellent<br />- For phone calls - where 3G is not available (I usually have $10 credit handy)<br />- For video calls - interviews, meetings, music classes<br />- Test call is very useful and I never had a bad experience
1577314808|1.0|Written for the naive young dimwits that can't wait for the fruits of their labor to produce a nest egg don't regret what you did in the past and don't worry about the future Live NOW it is the only time that really exists.  That pretty well sums up what this book is about and it will appeal to a lot of (Stupid) people who think they are intellectuals.

B0050DZ8J0|4.0|With all of the updates as of April 26, 2013, I am satisfied with LinkedIn's progress on user experience. It has all of the information I need. I would like them to be able to increase font size and have white on black interface. I still don't like their premier account request to see more than 3rd degree connections (but they have to monetize in addition to job sourcing, so I don't blame them).<br /><br />I have over 500 connections in my profile and it is very easy to browse connections, looks for updates, read LinkedIn  news etc. With the acquisition of Pulse News App, I am sure more UI goodness is coming.
0471463396|5.0|As a student in Economics and Finance I have found more common sense realistic analysis in this book than in all my finance courses where we assumed that a 10-year projection of earnings was somehow reasonable. I certainly advise it to anyone who is interested in learning more about stock and company valuation from a rigorous and common sense perspective.
B003Z0BWR2|4.0|bit like harry potter but older and more interesting, good characters and plot lines, hope the movie holds up to the books
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|This game is super adorable... and now there are two(!) Om Noms! How can you go wrong? Definitely a must buy, even if only to see the intro video
B0064MPXFA|4.0|After watching the subsequent seasons, I'm withdrawing my review and don't wish to promote this series.  I wrote an updated review but since it was critical of the pro-gay agenda, Amazon pulled it.
B004G600A4|5.0|I love it my kids love it. It was brand new and the package arrived before the expected due date. The price was the cheapest I had found!
B004VMUS9G|4.0|I really like this app. there are some bugs but you wont really notice them. all in all its a good app. I have this app on my kindle fire and its just nice to have whenever you need an alarm.but I will say when they fix the switching from screen to screen thing they will get five stars.
B00A83075M|5.0|The movie was brand New and it arrived before the expected date! My kids love it and I love that I could get it for such a great price!
B008MEM24S|5.0|My kids are 5, 7 and 8 and they LOVE this game.  It's even fun for adults.  Highly recommend this for anyone with kids over 5.  It would be a little hard for younger kids.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Som y times I. Reading this novel I wanted to shake Victoria into the present, to move on while being  charmed with her attachment to flowers. Really enjoyed the story
1452113432|5.0|Fabulous book, great recipes  and very well ilustrated?.. My wife loved it, it is simple, easy to cook at home without fancy/complex things
1400067820|4.0|If you take Taleb seriously (which is difficult because he spends most of his time telling you how great he is), then you'll learn that Taleb is just a fooled-by randomness black swan who only thinks he's great and therefore should not be taken seriously; this is unfortunate, because in places he is profoundly insightful.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is very fun!!!! It has easy games and hard games!!!! I love this game, it is awesome!!!!!! LOVE IT!!!!!!!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I'm sure you know the details of the plot already.  You are probably familiar with the music from the stage version.  The music and voices of the film are not as great as the stage version but you can watch this at home without waiting for the play to come back to town, if it even comes to your town.<br />The actors do a wonderful job bringing the story to passionate, emotional life in a richly detailed setting and they sing well while doing so.<br />My only quibble is that the Thenardiers are almost too slapstick and grotesque.<br />Watch this film for the whole story.  Listen to a stage version of your favorite songs.  Get the complete experience.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|I was so angry after spending $16.00 that when I finished the book I tore it up through it in the trash.  Where's the proof Dr.?  This guy is so full of himself.  Page after page of flowery repetition, over exaggerated narratives.  There was nothing to tell.  It was mostly filled with tons of back story about his two families and lots of medical jargon.  Hardly a thing about the NDE experience.  DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!
B00B52FDXQ|5.0|I absolutely loved Spartacus. I have to put it right up there with HBO's Rome and Deadwood,a style all it's own. Liam did an outstanding job replacing the incredible Andy Whitfield. Very sad it's over, I always looked forward to the next episode. The ending was very well done in my opinion. I AM SPARTACUS!
B00062IDCO|5.0|But am sure that it will be exactly what I wanted...I am a star trek fan for man years...I know I will enjoy these D V Ds
B005HSL626|4.0|well it's fun. And I doubt anybody would care what I have to say about it. Everyone knows about fruit ninja and the fun it brings.
1451638450|4.0|The often dismissed and frequently brow-beaten Ivan finally meets his match in a most unexpected way. Who says getting shot doesn't clear the mind and add a certain focus to the events surrounding you?<br />It is rare that I laugh out loud while reading sci fi, but this book had me howling! Nicely done, Lois, and let's see what happens with Ivan as he develops as a primary character in a continuing saga!<br />Great fun.

B000Q67DEO|5.0|I agree with the review written by Rachel Lae, this is a phenomenal album that is head and shoulders above the more popular AUTOAMERICAN and, as an entire album compares favorably to PARALLEL LINES.<br /><br />I was not a big BLONDIE fan, having owned their GREATEST HITS package and the original PARALLEL LINES disc only for many years.<br /><br />Not until I obtained a more recent GREATEST HITS package with an additional DVD of BLONDIE music videos did I discover the song UNION CITY BLUE, which immediately impressed my musical heart to become my favorite BLONDIE track of all-time and one of my favorite rock songs ever... The lyrics are a tad simple but that rich sound is just mind-blowing in its beauty.<br /><br />Then, for the same album to possess one of the best damn rock songs of all-time DREAMING, just causes my mind to boggle as to why these two songs weren't number 1 hits and why this album isn't caonsidered BLONDIES' best ever.<br /><br />Clem Burkes drum work on both of the fore-mentioned songs is just brilliant. I have tried looking for interviews in effort to learn how his drum work was recorded (single tracks or extensive overdubs, etc.) Why he was not regarded as one of the best drummers of his era I will never understand. ATOMIC also highlighted his drum work, along with the bass and guitar work of Nigel Harrison and Chris Stein respectively.<br /><br />Basically, this band understood the nature of good hooks. They had fabulous ears for melody and tone which allowed them to create singular pieces of brilliant music that stands alone yet sounds inherently pleasing (such as a song like TIDE IS HIGH.)<br /><br />The track SHAYLA is a mystery in its context and is nothing but haunting in its delivery. This song also resonates in me as one of the finest BLONDIE tracks of all time.<br /><br />This album has a few filler tracks but overall is nothing short of a work of art. Just a brilliant album by an tragically under-rated band. For any BLONDIE fans this album is a must-own. For any fan of 1980's music this album is a necessity. For everyone else, with any sense of interest in BLONDIE, I would start with this album, even though PARALLEL LINES and AUTOAMERICAN are more popular. As with this album, this band was far better than the sum of their hits.<br /><br />By the way, the accompanying DVD propels this album over PARALLEL LINES, in my sincere opinion. What a contrast are the primitive videos of those days compared to the overly produced junk of modern day music.<br /><br />Considering there are 4 distinct versions of this album out on Compact Disc, be certain in what you are ordering. First, one remastered version is the music disc alone with 4 bonus tracks (mostly live cuts), there are another two remastered versions of the music disc and the DVD of the album tracks 12 videos. The European version (with the cardboard multi-fold sleeve), has an international DVD version that does not play on U.S. players. The last version is the original CD version in un-remastered form.<br /><br />As for the album, it is simply a GREAT ALBUM, which makes me wonder why this album was not a huge hit.bum is a must-own.

B005S9ELVC|4.0|This movie was very well put together and the acting was perfect. Gangster Squad was very exciting and action packed. What's a better plot than a bunch of Gangster, good cops taking down some thug gangsters? I was so pleased with this movie that I went to see it twice in the movies.

1455869910|5.0|This books came in perfect time. I already read it from someone else and had to have it so others could read it too. It was great that thia copy came just in time for vacation. So I could read it to my wife
1592402690|5.0|Hi,<br />This is one of the greatest books about the Beatles that I've ever read. I've been listening to their music for the past 35 years but it's only after reading this book that I came to understand the depth of their music and the hard work that they all put into making it. It's a must read if you are interested in knowing how those fantastic songs and albums came to be and the role of their skillful and passionate sound engineer, Geoff Emerick, in making it all come together beautifully. He talks in technical terms sometimes-- as the book requires-- but in such a simple and straightforward language that makes it a lot of fun to read. The book also gives you an insight into the band members and how they worked together and how they were inspired (or sometimes annoyed) by each other. Enjoy!
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I got it on my kindle fire and it didn't work! It kept going to the home page! Not worth the download!

B00A77II0U|5.0|I loved this one. Was even sad at the end. I love how the strategy button was set up. Quick , easy to understand and always available not like a hint button. Don't know how long it was in hours but got my money worth. I'd like some more from Alawar Entertainment.
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|I've been a long time fan of NKOTB but this is the first CD of theirs that I've bought in awhile and the reviews for this one are correct. It is terrific. The songs are great, the vocals are still amazing. Any fan would be wise to pick this up.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|Terrible movie, awful writing, horrible acting from people who can actually act given the right script.  I couldn't finish it.  Didn't care how it turned out because the main characters were written as and acted so douche-y I couldn't be bothered.
0374533571|5.0|I first learned about the Silver Linings novel a couple of months ago, through a cousin. She begged me to watch the movie with her and I agreed to mainly because I wanted to see Jennifer Lawrence. I immediately fell in love with the story line so after I finished the film, I ordered the novel on Amazon. I can't help it but I am very OC about having to read the novel of a film I am planning to watch, although in this case I had to do it in reverse simply because I wanted to please my cousin! But anyways, having said this, I highly recommend this novel! It is heartwarming and extremely funny! I wish that the author had restrained himself from spoiling the endings of so many classic literary novels though. In his defense however, I guess it would not have been possible to make the correlations that the main character made with his life and these stories if the author did not in some way explain what these literary references were about. I hope that you enjoy this novel as much as I did! It is a realistic, humorous and sweet story about love, family and friendship! A must read, fast read.
B009AMANH4|5.0|The Movie was great and one I will watch several more times during the year.  The movie moved along and presented some education material that I was unaware of.
B006UKFFE0|4.0|There are real problems with the Kindle edition: words and sentences cut off in numerous places, poorly formatted. I returned mine and purchased the ebook on the publisher O'Reilly's site instead. That version is formatted much better, with no truncated text (also no DRM and free updates too).

B005S9EKCW|5.0|Every bit as good as the play and better.  The performances were outstanding and the Photography was great.  It is amazing that a play as old as this is still attracts such an audience.
0765356147|4.0|Brandon Sanderson, unlike so many others, finished a trilogy with flying colors (\\"The Hero of Ages\\" (Tor, $27.95, 576 pages)). Too often, the epic trilogy's strong setup is ruined by a weak payoff - but Sanderson slays that dragon in the satisfying conclusion of the Mistborn series.<br /><br />Even better, there aren't any dragons on Sanderson's saga, though there are plenty of unusual characters, and a carefully worked-out magical system. Those who have read the first two books (\\"Mistborn\\" and \\"The Well of the Ascension\\") should definitely get on board for volume three, and now that the trilogy is complete, I can confidently recommend it to those who are wary of such substantial investments (both financial and time).<br /><br />Things are a little grim in \\"The Hero of Ages\\", as Sanderson doesn't avoid the trap of constant struggle and pain that drags so many trilogies down. It would have been much more pleasant to have had a little joy and light along the way (you'd think more fantasy writers would emulate Tolkien and Christopher Paolini, in that regard), and it would also have developed the characters a little more fully.<br /><br />Nonetheless, the Mistborn series is one of the best trilogies in recent years, and Sanderson, unlike so many, manages to deliver on the promise of the first two volumes with a worthy, and page-turning, conclusion.
B00AJLHUAS|5.0|Once I got past my initial disappointment that Bryan Ferry's wonderful and distinctive voice is not a part of The Jazz Age and instead reveled in all the glorious instrumental music, I soon became smitten with this fun and seductive homage to the early days of jazz.<br /><br />There is so much to like here and while I seriously lack the musical writing skills to give the album full justice, I will say this: the way it so perfectly captures the original sounds of the twenties is downright eerie, but in the best possible way. It actually gave me the heebie-jeebies at some points.<br /><br />I pretty much love everything here. \\"Love Is The Drug,\\" \\"Don't Stop The Dance,\\" \\"I Thought\\" and \\"Reason Or Rhyme\\" are my absolute favorites. I could almost live off of \\"Don't Stop The Dance\\" for the rest of my life! It has played repeatedly on my stereo, its pleasing and relentless beats hard to resist.<br /><br />While I've never been a big fan of albums that are entirely instrumental, I haven't been able to take The Jazz Age out of my cd player the past few days. It's just too awesome not to listen to for hours on end!<br /><br />As they might have said in the 1920s, it's the bee's knees!:)
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Denzel always does a good job in any role.  The end was pretty good.  I even got a little teary eyed at the end.
0062127241|2.0|I have been a huge fan of Pete Townshend my entire life.  His abilities to compose music, play guitar and take the stage are clearly second to none.  Let me encapsulate this entire book for you:<br /><br />- I drank Remy Martin by the gallon.  I have been drunk for more than half my life.<br />- I did drugs.<br />- I womanized and cheated extensively on my wife (who in no way deserved it).<br />- I vaporized cash by the truckload.<br />- I am extremely talented both as a musician and artist.<br />- I am tired (pretty much the message throughout the book).<br />- I like sex and have felt consistently inadequate thus I have to prove myself.<br />- I had children although nobody really knows much about them (including me).<br /><br />All done.  Nothing really detailed about his family and the toll it took on them, a little but (but not enough) about where his music actually came from.  He introduces tons of characters and people and assumes we know them and can remember them throughout the book.  It's a hard read and hard to follow.  Every page is racked with his angst.  Although an angst wrapper gets fairly tiresome by the 50th page, let alone the 500th.  I guess I was expecting more from a 500 page tome than this, especially penned by such a talented guy and someone I consider to be a national British treasure.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|Lean In brings the important subject of gender in the workplace to a place where we can talk about it openly and without having to be defensive. This is important to the future! It's not groundbreaking but, change is never fast. Not real, generation altering change, at least. Let's take this opportunity to build on the research and opinion of this book and move forward. Let's keep talking!
B005JABSB6|2.0|Be careful with seller C, when I first ordred these they were avaialable from seller C and shipped by Amazon Prime. Well when they arrived I opened the box to only find that that I had recieved the AN3DG30 instead of the AN3DG20B... so ended up getting a refund and re-ordering from seller CT-X. Hopefully CT-X will ship the correct product this time. Rating will more than likely be better than 2 stars when I get the PROPER product and try them.
0375826742|4.0|Now that we've gotten past Christopher Paolini's great backstory - teen-age author spurned by publishers, puts out book himself as family goes into debt, hits jackpot - his Inheritance series (which started with \\"Eragon\\") should be treated just like every other fantasy epic.<br /><br />\\"Brisingr\\" (Knopf, $27.50, 763 pages) is the third installment of a series that was originally going to be a trilogy, and, well, it's pretty good. It's too long, by about 150 pages (supposedly it was even longer before editing), as Paolini lets individual scenes go for too many pages, and that's really the main flaw.<br /><br />Otherwise, the protagonist, Eragon, and his dragon, Saphira, continue to battle the evil ruler of Alaegesia, Galbatorix, who has enormous power and admits his own insanity. There are plenty of hairbreadth escapes, bloody battles and heroic adventures, but a little more attention might be paid to the broader outlines of the plot. If, for example, Galbatorix is so powerful, why can the chronic underdogs, the Varden, win battles? Why doesn't Galbatorix just swat them like annoying flies?<br /><br />That said, Paolini does understand the importance of pacing. Unlike so many fantasy authors, he gives his characters, and his readers, opportunities to rest and recover, and splices in scenes of peace and positive accomplishment amidst the necessary struggle and disaster.<br /><br />And, length aside, \\"Brisingr\\" is a fine work of the imagination, a truly epic fantasy that manages to make the familiar characters - dragons, elves, dwarves, wizards - fresh and compelling. Those who have read the first two books should definitely keep going, and fantasy fans who have feared this is just a young adult series should set aside their doubts and start with \\"Eragon.\\"
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|When I was a kid, I never just played with GI joes or ninja turtles or x-men. I had to mix all the toys together and create an epic story worthy of all of them. This is what the author of Ready Player One has done, he has created an epic worthy of all the toys in his toybox, and invited us all to come play.
141659521X|5.0|I really enjoy the Mitch Rapp series of books. They are entertaining and keep the reader going to find out what is going to happen . Of course, it's a given that Rapp will survive all of the actions and the plots to terminate him. In addition, those among his own countrymen who detest the CIA and all that it stands for get their just \\"reward\\" at the end of the book.<br /><br /> The plot concerns a missing CIA agent in Afghanistan whose mind is filled with secrets about spies and operations, the revelation of which will cause great damage to the CIA's worldwide operations. Rapp is sent in to find the man, and becomes the target for assassination by an old enemy. There are twists and turns galore in the book, and the pages keep flying by as the reader anxiously awaits the next conundrum facing Rapp and his men, and also the CIA director.<br /><br /> It all turns out well in the end, as expected, but it's a thrilling ride along the way!
B000YJ54DU|4.0|I am having hard time to understand our reviews.  I've been reading all of the JR book in order.  Before I downloaded this one, I thought hard as the reviews were plainly bad.  To remain true to my endeavor, I decided to download it.<br /><br />The story, the narration, the arrogance of Jack is almost the same as the others.  So I honestly don't understand why people puts this book in a different (and low) place.  Jack is alone. Comes into town. Someone tells him something. He doesn't like. He decideds to rebel as usual. Than he meets girl... Sounds familiar?<br /><br />I'm happy that I've read this.  If you're JR fan, please do read it.

0670026557|2.0|I had high hopes from the book because I have been thinking a lot about how much altruism there is in this world. Many people donate time, money and knowledge anonymously and sometimes clandestinely. I have wondered if these people are motivated by religious beliefs (that they will be rewarded by God, either in present life or in heaven).  The book (Give & Take) did not address altruism at all so it did not fulfill my expectations on that dimension. But this is not the fault of the author.<br /><br />The author shows off that he is the youngest tenured and *single* highest rated professor at Wharton. By tooting his own horn he raised my expectations that the book would be reporting scholarly research. But it's not scholarly at all - it has about 10-12 anecdotal stories, which a journalist could have researched over a period of one year and reported.  On this dimension, I fault the author because he brags about his credentials but the credentials don't fulfill the readers' expectations.<br /><br />In my view, the dozen or so people discussed in the book (who the author labels as \\"givers\\" or \\"takers\\") have the same goals and motives. They want to be successful. I am sure all of them wish to be good and do good and they try to help others, as and when they can. However they go about it differently.  The ones Adam calls givers seem to have long term strategies and are willing invest in their social and/or professional reputations (i.e., be viewed as helpful and giving people) in order to be rewarded, directly or indirectly, voluntarily, perhaps decades later. The givers are busy promoting themselves (e.g., Stenker, the accounting professor, shows off his popularity and probably gets paid a lot and has a lot of power at Wharton, or we read how Hornick, the venture capitalist, hosts professional parties where he ends up being in the spotlight). On the other hand, those who Adam calls takers seem to have short term strategies, and specific rewards in mind (not indirect andgeneral rewards), and they don't seem to be patient. Perhaps sometimes the takers try to get rewards by force on their own terms and in that they might behave illegally or unethically and irritate or annoy people around them. Call them immature.<br /><br />So we dislike the people Adams calls takers and like the people he calls givers.  In my view their goals and objectives are the same (or at least similar - i.e., they want to succeed and do well for themselves) but their strategies are different.<br /><br />I'm interested in knowing how altruists (those who give anonymously) do in life. The book does not have any discussion of altruism or any testable hypothesis that I could see - specifically, how could one determine whether a person is an altruist or a long-term opportunist? The giver's behavior is indistinguishable from the behavior of reputation-builder who hopes to receive rewards or status, in direct and indirect ways, perhaps far in the future.  Reputation-builders optimize their behavior by keeping a long-term perspective on each investment they make (like, Warren Buffett does with his financial investments), whereas the takers have a short-term horizon (like, hedge fund managers).<br /><br />There is no data and empirical evidence that there are more givers who succeed than there are takers, as asserted by Adam.<br /><br />Adam could have, for example, asked Wikipedia to estimate how many unrecognized people there are in the Wiki community who contribute time or money, anonymously, without ever receiving any recognition. Adam could have told us stories of such people by describing their profiles if not their identities. I realize some people give time and knowledge on Wikipedia hoping to become part of the site-police who monitor and decide what content is acceptable and what is not; but most people contribute anonymously (altruistically). We might think they do it as a hobby; OK, but they are not receiving recognition that they could use to get direct or indirect favors or rewards, now or in the future.<br /><br />Millions of people in the free world put their lives in harms way (soldiers) who do not need income, nor are they drafted. They do it because they believe in freedom - these people are true givers (altruists) - not the people who Adam has written about in his book.  To make a case whether givers succeed researchers should research and report what fraction of altruists (people who give money, time and knowledge, anonymously, or who put their lives in harms way) succeed and how successful are they and in what way do they succeed aside from personal gratification?<br /><br />I DID NOT LEARN ANYTHING FROM THIS BOOK. I hope scholars will do empirical research, rather than run quick experiments offering tidily amounts ($20--$50) to students (who need the money or like to play with the experimenters by distorting the results with screwy behavior and screwy answers) or to poor people who are willing to come to research labs and play the role of experiment-subjects, or conducting ambiguous surveys where people are asked to rate themselves as givers or takers. Duh! what do you think they will say? Either they will play mischief and say they are greedy, selfish takers or, like most people, they will say they are actually givers but act as matchers in the in real world because they do not want to appear as chumps and be exploited.  In surveys and experiments people give answers to questions, which are not reflective of how they actually behave in reality or would under \\"real\\" conditions, where there is real and significant risk to their actions and decisions and when they are not sure if they are being monitored (with security cameras) or not.in the free world put their lives in harms way (soldiers) who do not need income, nor are they drafted. They do it because they believe in freedom - these people are true givers - not the people who Adam Grant has written about in his book.<br /><br />Give and Take is not a serious study - it is a bunch of anecdotal stories (10--12) of people painted as \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" based on the strategy (the time horizon) they use for optimization - in my view, they are all takers. There is no attempt in the book to discover the clandestine thieves, those who send spam mail or malicious viruses, executives who extract resources from organizations, fund managers and others who steal information and trade on it, versus the people who put their lives on line to defend the weak or to defend their country or those who quietly (without being noticed or recognized) donate time, money and knowledge for the betterment of society.<br /><br />I LEARNED NOTHING FROM THIS BOOK. It has a few NOT very compelling stories, which are drawn out.  I feel I wasted a lot of my time. I hope Adam and some true scholars will do empirical research, rather than run experiments offering tidily amounts ($20--$50) to students (who need the money or like to screw around with experimenters by distorting the results with screwy behavior) or to poor people willing to come to research labs and play the role of experiment-subjects, or conducting ambiguous surveys where people are asked to rate themselves as givers or takers (duh! what do you think they will say?

B007BGQFTQ|5.0|This series reminds me a great deal of Caroline Stevemer's &#34;Sorcery and Cecelia&#34; and it's sequels, though with a slightly more adult attitude towards sex and relationships.. (It isn't at any point sexually explicit, but there is certainly reference to bedroom activities, which Stevemer's series stays well away from---it is much closer to a romance novel than a straight fantasy)<br /><br />The main character and all the colorful secondary characters are delightful, especially the fashion-forward vampire Lord Akeldama, the hat-crazy Ivy, and the cross-dressing inventor Ms Lefoux.  The series ties up a lot of loose ends nicely in the last book, while leaving the world open and interesting, which I appreciate.
B00138EWGG|5.0|Just a must have album for all those who get chills at the sound of a Marshall Stack Feeding Back and Mind Melting Vocals.<br />If your reading this and you know nothing about Judas Priest or this genre from this era in particular (Late 70's and 80's) this will be a good place to get off your ass and rectify the major malfunction your non-metal life is having. Bang your head, raise your devil horns, and scream at the top of your lungs while playing this album at &#34;11&#34;. Just get it and rocka rolla.

The game really needs some revisions.  Complained before , but no change.

B00BDSRISA|1.0|Was it supposed to show up with the outer CD case cracked on the front and back as MINE did? the music is sweet the case looks like a 200 pound ex girlfriend @ 5\\"4' named Kathleen stomped on it. BYE KATHLEEN you are crazy, go walk your dog with my flash light
B000YHG72E|5.0|Not a big Will Ferrell fan, but really enjoyed him in this movie.  This is my new favorite holiday movie.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|it didn't work as well but at least it wakes me up so I'm not late for school I love this app
B00B671VYU|5.0|After listening every Lordi album, have to say I'm really impressed with this one. Surpassed my expectations as a fan.<br /><br />Thais album is very different in different ways. I like how it focus more into the music than any other of their albums. Plus it's more upbeat and with more added effects.<br /><br />It's easy to appreciate the musical breaks in &#34;I'm the Best&#34;. The classic horror effects in &#34;Happy New Fear&#34; and my personal favorite: &#34;Schizo Doll&#34; which sounds like a creepy dark version of Toy Story.<br /><br />They really reached a new level with this album. &#34;The Riff&#34; has to be their best single since &#34;Hard Rock Hallelujah&#34;. According to them, this album was influenced by Otus's way to play. And the changes really revived the band. Excellent album even if you haven't been a Lordi fan before.
1416575464|5.0|I liked the reviews of this book and decided I must have it since I was looking for ideas that I could use in  my informal, book-filled home. The price was right and the book meets my expectations.
B0094MFITS|4.0|I liked this movie. It has a little bit of a made-for-tv feel to it, but the story is interesting and Selleck is very believable and likeable as the small-town cop with a past. If you like mysteries and police stories this is worth checking out. The movie is on the slow side, pacing wise, but that didn't bother me as the atmosphere of Paradise was engaging. Good acting by the primary people too.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Ever since I was little, u thought that it would be cool to wake up to an alarm playing my selected tunes.. my sleep was often interrupted by an annoying song on my clock radio. It's a small detail, but having this ability with this app truly does delight me! This .99 app simply works without complications. Love it!
B0047Y17P2|5.0|Michael Connelly has the knack of writing a series that always holds your attention and has enough twists and turns to keep you looking forward to the next chapter. Great author and great book. The Lincoln Lawyer and the Bosch series complement each other and I am looking forward to the next installments.
067144901X|4.0|I like this book and think my nephew will like it when he is older.  I started reading this to him when he was around 2 1/2 months. Cute animal pictures and rhymes!
B008NW67E0|5.0|I loved Babel. I want to thank you for your help with getting my CD. I love shopping Amazon. Everything I have ever gotten has be up to my standards and sometimes even better. Thank you
B00CBKXGPI|1.0|I really wish I could give this a zero. Soooooo boring. Basically you &quot;aquire &quot; art &amp; stars. You find differences in pics. Or objects. No storyline. No mini games. No items. No fun!<br />If you want fun HO adventure games try: Stray Souls, Enigmatis, Mystery of Ravenhurst (not the exact title but I think you can find it anyway)
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I can't wait for the next book.  Would still like to learn more of Gideon's past.  These 2 characters are really messed up because of their child hood.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|Everyone should read this series and the third book better come out soon because I cannot wait to see what happens next!!!!
B001EBWING|5.0|I actually loved this movie - I normally am not into the older black and white films but really liked the directors work.  I thought the film was amusing, and it moved pretty quickly, which is something I find key since I really dislike slow movies.  It has a good plot line and keeps you guessing until the very end!
0671449028|5.0|Cute funny book with all the animals exercising, brushing teeth and getting ready for bed together is quite fun! I really love the pictures!  I have read this book several times to my 3-month old nephew and he is not too interested yet, but I know he will like it when he is older!
B00122MWU6|5.0|I don't know why I didn't buy this sooner!  I just didn't think or know a lot of their music.  I can't stop playing this.. I absolutely love it.  :)
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|After reading the book, decades ago, this was a refreshing remebarance of Tolkien's story. Excellent 3D images and film quality. Maintais Lord of the Rings standard.
B008Y2VTIS|5.0|I absolutely loved season one and season two was a great continuation of the story line.  I can't wait to see season 3!!!
B00CAJP0ZO|4.0|4 stars.  Very good album. Love to listen to it while working out.  Would have given it 5 stars, but one song is not my fav.  All in all, a great CD.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is not a horror book, first of all. This is science-fiction. Now I believe that fans of historical fiction and Stephen King shouldered  this book. The book has a great story and well developed  characters. I don't want to spoil anything but pay attention to th  details while reading it. You will understand more things.
B00BF11UM0|5.0|Great movie which details  how Bin Lauden was tracked and killed.  Some pretty unpleasant torture scenes, but realistic.  Hope I never have to be interrogated by these guys.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I absolutely love this app! I know that I'll be saving lots of money! And I'm finding great new hair styles and make up tips! I may even take on reupholstering my chair!
B00006CXSS|5.0|Great series and a Must watch.<br />True story and told from the mouth of the men who survived it.<br />True heroism
B006VREHRS|5.0|A fantastic series.  I rented the DVDs from Netflix and I could hardly wait for the next one to come in the mail.  I am hooked on this program.
0988178532|5.0|Wow, what a wild book! Super plot, cool settings, interesting characters, I especially identified with the hero, Nate. He's like a real person, with plenty of flaws and suddenly he has to deal a world of trouble. We watch him struggle to handle it and see him grow. But he falls back again, like one step forward, two steps back. As I said, he is a realistic hero in a beautiful fantasy-like story, which takes place in modern day Oregon. Outview is a gripping read which makes you think and makes you desperate for book two!
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|This is a combination of fun and logic meets addiction<br />! I have to force myself to stop! THIS is a must have game!
098357670X|5.0|There are so many things I can say about this book but to sum it up in one word, AMAZING! If you read it cover-to-cover and practice the techniques you WILL get better at doing caricatures! I was amazed at how much my work improved after reading this! It is also a great reference to come back to from time to time! I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to explore doing caricatures!
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I loved this book. The action was constant and I was unable to guess the finish. I saw another review that it was straight from the Twilight Zone. I would agree with this statement telling you that I loved that series also. A book that is worth your time and money. Thank you MR. Crouch and continue with similar great reads.
B004A8ZWSS|3.0|I enjoyed  the beauty of Angelina Jolie. It's kind of a brainless movie with no meaningful content. I guess I enjoyed it but I would never watch it again or recommend it.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|It a good game because u can learn a lot of think like to take care of animals and all that
B009AMANBA|5.0|Excellent movie about probably our greatest president. This is a must see for everyone.<br />Stephen Spielberg did a great job with this movie.
0743289692|5.0|Insightful, moving and well written.  Ayaan Hirsi Ali tells of her childhood, growing up in Somalia and later in Holland, her challenges and accomplishments.  I highly recommend it.
B004498KPU|5.0|Got this for my family and they loved it!  Little ones now dancing around and singing his tunes which is adorable and fun for all of us.  Great find!
B00007KWHP|5.0|I've always loved this album.  It was impressive for it's musical prowess back then, and with this edition it just gets better. Thank you, Yes!
1439190275|5.0|One of the doctors that I work for recommended this book and it is now part of our everyday life.  My husband and I have both lost weight by following the information in the book.
0812993845|5.0|Sophie Kinsella did a great job with this book. It is the madcap tale of two sisters, Lottie and Fliss.<br />Lottie is heart-broken by her man, falls into the arms of a past love, decides to marry him on a moment's<br />notice, and Fliss gets involved. Fliss sets out to de-rail her sister's honeymoon, She will stop at nothing<br />(really!) to keep Lottie from consummating the marriage. The craziness and hilarity that ensues will make<br />you laugh out loud. I found this story to be a very funny mental health break and highly recommend it.
B007REV4T8|5.0|This is by far the best James Bond movie ever.<br />Very well done constant action throughout.<br />Everyone should see this movie.
B00BJDARGO|5.0|Prior to its release there were several websites that reported that this BD setlist was rather short.  The concert from which it is drawn was actually only a few more songs longer, but since they didn`t owned the rights for these, they sticked to those included.<br /><br />With this in mind, I already knew that if the concert/audio/video were worthy, this BD will make it to my collection.<br /><br />As I am mainly a music customer, what I have always found extremely helpful about reading Amazon customer reviews is having the opportunity to inform myself about the quality of a CD , DVD or Blu-ray.<br /><br />And by quality, I do not mean its price or the length of the material, but the quality of the performance, the audio and the video.  Attributes that if done right, will give me some quality time (albeit short) in my home theater room.<br /><br />Please spend less time evaluating product value based on price and more on the quality of the product itself.
B000Y7ZHCU|3.0|This played very well.  Quality of video CD was great but content was lacking.  Too much Vegas glitz & glam.  Preferred her earlier work much more than this spray tanned blonde version.
B0045EA1P6|4.0|I bought this for my wife, because she likes Fun.  Fun is not my style.  Fun is not something I do.
B009VMN3RA|3.0|Reads like a bad Lifetime Movie.  Not well-balanced, all about what a wonderful, insightful and intelligent child she was and her parents were horrible.  Really?  Haven't we heard this story before from other kids of Hollywood parents?  Nothing new here....
B004DLPXAO|1.0|In my opinion, the 4.0.0.304 update constitutes a significant reduction in ease-of-use. The first, and most obvious change, is the home screen. In previous versions, this was a list of the e-books on your device; in the current version, the top 2/3 of your display is a carousel presentation of the most recently-read e-books, and the bottom third has a presentation of either \\"Best Sellers\\" or \\"Recommended\\" books. When I read a book with the app and finish it, that's almost certainly going to be the _last_ book on the device I'm going to pick to read again; having the carousel be filled with my most recently-read books is a list of the books I _don't_ want to pick, which makes it useless to me. Similarly, I do my shopping for e-books from Amazon through their website, where I can flip through lists of e-books and open new tabs for the ones that look interesting, then go back after I've collected a number of possibilities and look them over at more leisure. When I open my Kindle app on my tablet, I'm looking to _read_ an e-book, not _buy_ one; this makes the remainder of the home screen a waste of display space.<br /><br />Then there are the categories for listing the items on the device -- 'On Device', 'Books', 'Docs', 'Newsstand'. I don't have anything in 'Newsstand', so I don't know how the category is defined, but 'Books' and 'Docs' appear to be \\"E-book purchases made from Amazon\\" and \\"Any e-book _not_ purchased from Amazon\\", respectively; innocently expecting to find all the books I'd loaded on my tablet, I selected 'Books' and found that all of the books I'd bought from baenebooks.com were missing; they show up under 'Docs', and 'On Device' shows everything. It's a pity that these categories appear to be hard-coded into the app, and there's no way for you to set your own categories, or, like the Kindle e-reader, to group books into collections instead of having them 'loose' in the display of titles, where books in a series may be scattered all through the list (display by title), or scattered between different authors if they are collaborations (display by author).<br /><br />It would have been useful for the update to have a configuration setting that allowed users to pick which of the various library tabs the app opened with; that would have alleviated the majority of my disgruntlement over the changes, but the creation of e-book categories and shoving all the 'not bought from Amazon' books under 'documents' with no way to change the categorization feels a bit like they're being shoved into a ghetto for 'unterbooks'.<br /><br />The actual _reading_ functionality of the app, however, remains as good as it has been in previous versions; my objections to the changes in the newest version are entirely centered around the UI for the front end before you begin reading an e-book.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|This is a great CD to listen to in the car on the road.  I have a quality sound system in my car and the sound is fabulous.  Peaceful, calming, and serene, yet full of unexpected sounds that you won't get on traditional radio pop or rock stations.  A bit bluesy, a bit romantic, a bit bluegrass, a bit orchestral, all blended together into a lovely CD.  Absolutely, the spirit of Justin Hayward is here.  Peace to all in the music with much sincerity.  No wonder everyone loves Justin's music.  Try it and keep listening.  Music doesn't get much better than this in the spirit of love and peace.  Lovely mandolin work by Mr. David Harvey makes this quite outstanding.
B001795SH8|5.0|I wouldnt say that these recordings are &#34;much better&#34; than the previous cycle (which is now off the market), but they sound great.
6304498969|5.0|Bought these Clapton items for my hubby who has really enjoyed the very much.  Good quality and plays very well.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great app for simple math.  I'm glad I found something simple to use for quick access to a calculator.
B0063FGG22|5.0|I love the older movies.  Not much out that I really like for my age of Comedy or Suspense.  I'm a younger generation who appreciates the older movies.  Cary Grant really took the roll of Roger Thornhill and made it what I would had imagined it in today's society if it would had been made by a wonderful director with a good cast and a wonderful script.  The acting was taken a step further by Grant and Saint.  They made this movie their own.  Love the cameo by Alfred!  I just hope they never remake this movie.  This is by far a  classic.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Now this was a pleasant suprise. Light yet gripping read, cleverly written with a strong lead character. I enjoyed it thoroughly and looked forward to continue reading it - what more can you ask for?
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love plaing this on my kindle<br />I would buy it again<br />I got ot for free and I am happy
B0000024YL|5.0|a real trip down memory lane-this was one of the most influential groups of the 60's and 70's and their music still conveys a message
B003ZIXO0C|5.0|This is much more like the Celine we know & love.  Remove the glitz & glam of Vegas to find a truly incredible artist at work!  Video was great quality and very enjoyable!
B007PBKG5G|5.0|This group has been in my playlist for a few months- great singer and songwriting- pure southern comfort: sweet, silky and with a kick on backside
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Found this book to be a great read. It was sad and funny at the same time. Loved how two sad
B0042O85ES|2.0|Just a re-packaging of the same disks with a few extra items. Better to buy &#34;Ladys and Gentelmen&#34; on blu-ray.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Mediocre at best. Slow paced and boring.  It is a game that is not challenging at all.  If it moved a little faster, maybe that would help.
B006RXPTNM|4.0|My dad, who was not exactly known for being a philosopher or sophisticate, would have said, \\"They're just going to talk this one to death! I wonder if there's a 'Gunsmoke' rerun on somewhere!\\" So if you're looking for a fast-paced, in-your-face movie, this one's not for you. If you want one that's unpredictable and unusual, one that will make you ponder, and one that's brimming with top-notch acting, this is certainly one. Reviewers who say Hoffman was sleepwalking thru his part I think have misunderstood that \\"Father Flynn\\" is SUPPOSED to be contemplative and sincere and reasonably controlled (until accusations are flung at him, THEN he does become, uh, LESS calm). Meryl is her usual superbly flawless acting self, and I'm always prejudiced toward Amy, so yes, a strong 4 out of 5 stars from me.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|Got this for my family and they loved it!  Little ones now dancing around and singing his tunes which is adorable and fun for all of us.  Great find!  A bit harder to understand lyrics with the live concerts though.
1476719071|5.0|I'm a 32 year old female and would recommend this book to any girl out there that loves a good love story with a little suspsense.  In fact, after finishing this book in less than a day, I have 3 friends who are going to read it.  I just could not put it down!  It had a couple corny parts that reminded me of a high school book/movie, but other than that it is one of my faves!  It's like a PG13 version of 50 Shades of Grey.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|the fringe is a great series that explores the scientic field in the outside realm that sounds more like magic in some cases
B0000DC13U|1.0|It would have been good just to watch some studio jams but it was used as a backdrop for some stupid political agenda. Don't waste your money, watch it on youtube if you must.
B000B7HZXM|5.0|He has a 4cd set of American standards with outstanding orchestration and each offers duets with famous gal singers.this is our favorite pool music
1416914285|4.0|Well, where do I start? The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones is a fun and exciting ride of twists and turns of events. Now, before I read this book completely, I tried to read it once and was confused, so I put it down, but slowly over time I came back to the book thinking about another chance, but I never did. It wasn't until recently that I saw the trailer for the movie and immediately I wanted to read the book because it looked so interesting. So I started to read again, and boy was I in for a wild ride! Clary keeps seeing these people called Shadowhunters who hunt demons and in reality she's not supposed to be seeing them because she's a mundane, a human, or so she thinks. There's a whole story background to the Shadowhunters, but I won't give too much away. This book is really all about Clary finding her mother, who has been kidnapped and along the way, she meets more Shadowhunters, and she finds out who she really is. I don't want to give too much away. Yes, this book does remind me of Harry Potter just a smidgen, but if you compare the two, they're two completely different worlds. The only reason why I gave this book four (I would've given it five) was because I spoiled myself with some spoilers. I hate to do it, but when I was looking on the comments from the video, I spotted myself some comments that contained spoilers and to me, I was still having fun reading it, I just wish that I didn't see the spoilers. It made the book seem less enjoyable, I think knowing them. But there were some twists and turns that I didn't see coming which made it enjoyable. Another reason why I gave this book four stars was because of the description. I tried desperately to imagine the buildings like the Institute, for example, but it just wouldn't come to my mind. It was hard immagining it. Other than that, I enjoyed what I didn't already know from the spoilers and I can't wait to get my hands on the rest of the series.
B0000TB014|5.0|Got this for my family and they loved it!  Little ones now dancing around and singing his tunes which is adorable and fun for all of us.  Great find!
B0091REZMW|4.0|The only problem I have is that you have to wait for more energy. But I'm not the most patient person lol. It's a really fun game to play when your bored.

B00A83075M|5.0|Very cute movie. Kids and husband loved it.<br />I don't know what else to say to use up the required words, have a great day!
B000005RQT|5.0|Love this album!!! Much Heavier than I expected it to be and like the extras on the album. Not particularly fond of the small chats that get their own &#34;feature&#34; on the album. I think they should just be included with the beginnings of the songs and there are a lot of repeats of one song, but it's still kinda fun to hear all the different ways they went with it and the out takes.
B00BJO5SXK|5.0|This disc was for my daughter and she loved it! She loved the music and the way it was packaged. The posters are hanging on her wall.
B0051YKUYG|5.0|Never will be another who can or will sing like her.  One of a kind talent and amazing collaboration.  Really loved the mix with Sinatra also.  Worth the $.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like this game and I had it for an hour now and my family is complaining about me not watching tv with them because I'm playing this xp but I like this game it's cool.

B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game! It is by far the best bingo game I have ever played. It's fun, you get to interact with other players, you can even have teammates. We all help eachother out. They also regularly add new rooms. The slots are very fun as well. I am a huge fan of bingo blitz!
0345528581|5.0|Gives you solid information about every exercise and how your supposed to complete. Lays out workout plan for you. Overall good purchase
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I feel like the story was a good one....I work at a 300 year old plantation ans do know that the history of slavery is painful one....I imagine that many of these things could very easily have taken place.  I am hoping that the author's storytelling or writing skills will improve in time.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|It seems that somewhere between Pulp Fiction and now, Tarantino has learned how to make a movie with some amount of depth and even occasional subtlety.  I admit I don't know when that occurred, because the soulless Pulp Fiction thoroughly put me off his work for a while.  At some point QT got into elaborate revenge flicks, and having covered women and Jewish people already he's now turned to African-Americans.  When I watched Django I was more interested in the controversy than the movie, but I actually found the latter quite engaging and not as uncomfortable as I expected it to be.<br /><br />The media informs us that Tarantino movies glorify over-the-top violence, but at least with Django the reality is a bit more nuanced.  Importantly, violence against slaves is ONLY meant to be thoroughly disturbing.  The way such scenes are shot reinforces this through focusing on other characters' faces as they look pained or saddened, and toning down the gore to realistic levels for the situation.  Violence towards criminals and slave owners is over-the-top to the point of cartoonish, freeing one from the obligation to empathize with said bad people.  The excess in these scenes is more to do with ludicrous blood splatters than sadistic punishment, with most people just dying in gunfights.  Conversely, if you turn on network TV, you may see someone flayed and several people burned to death by \\"good guys\\", so I'm coming to the conclusion that QT is unfairly scapegoated for the violence in our media.<br /><br />Moral quibbles aside, Django is a good movie with great acting.  It's also free of the famous \\"Tarantino conversations\\", which I find distracting though I understand they represent realistic patterns of speech.  No other part of the movie is heavily concerned with realism.  History and ballistics are reinterpreted through the lens of what looks coolest at the moment.  Though this led to me rolling my eyes a couple of times, it's a stylistic choice and thus not a big deal.<br /><br />Django Unchained isn't perfect, but I'm giving it five stars for being the best at what it is: a revenge epic turned up-to-eleven that fearlessly depicts a sore spot in our history.  Show me another movie that can pull that off with any class.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|There are few books that compare. Thus book is full of dramatic situations  the style if writing is perfectly suited for the intended audience. Casual but with substance. Fantastic book.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|This movie is so awesome! The special effects are amazing, and they couldn't have picked anyone better to play young Bilbo! He's the spitting image of the older Bilbo in The Fellowship of the Ring, and you can really tell that he and Merry and Pippin are related because he bears a strong resemblance to both of them at times! The Hobbit is even more awesome than the LOTR movies! I can't wait for the next two in the trilogy! :D
1455526959|2.0|I've read every book by Connelly. Up until the last couple I've loved them all. Unfortunately Connelly has an annoying habit of having Harry Bosch \\"nod\\" at least once a page. Seriously- it's like a tic. On one page 3 different characters nodded within about 8 lines. Until recently I've been able to at least get past that because the books were good, but lately, and particularly with this one, Connelly seems to have had his well run dry. Cartoon characters- the lieutenant, Chu, the gang bangers, the gangbanger's baby momma, the bad guys- all shallow, trite and one dimensional.The plot twist was so evident about halfway through that there really was no suspense, and the IA detective's sudden appearance at the end was unexplained and totally unbelievable. This series has run its course and it's time for Harry to really retire.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|If you read the book, you'll love this movie.  Enthralling and fresh, I absolutely can't wait for the next 2 movies to come out.  I'll buy them right away.
B00B89WXYS|4.0|Not my favorite OneRepublic album, but enjoyable never the less.  Would still likely buy again if I had the choice.
B007FKI9G0|5.0|A true classic. I forgot what a great movie this was until viewing it again as an adult. Even our 16 year old found it entertaining.
B0074MZSWW|1.0|Rarely am I trumped in my choice of words for a review; positive or negative.  But kudos for the folks that gave this turkey one star.  Review after review nailed it perfectly...'the recording engineer should be fired'...'the recording engineer should never be allowed to work in the industry again after producing this POS'....delightful, yet sadly, true.  I eagerly awaited the arrival of this CD from Amazon after ordering the disc the night of Alabama Shakes' appearance on SNL.  When I sat down to listen, I assumed there was something wrong with my system...perhaps a leaky cap or other (the distortion was so pervasive).  But grabbing and playing an old standby reference CD (anything Steely Dan) proved me wrong...it's the damn CD!!  Too bad, because the band, through the grunge, sounded like something I'd stay up all night to hear.  Sigh. Oh well, it did arrive on time...
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|great funny flick as im pushing 40. follows the usual routine of these type of films. highly recommend if you like to laugh.
B000002JPA|5.0|Dream Theater's second proper album, \\"Images And Words,\\" has aged slightly. After all, it might have come out in 1992,but there is a strong Eighties vibe coursing throughout these eight songs. The major drawback is James LaBrie's vocals, which, at times, sound very cheesy and Eighties. (On some of the tracks, his vocals and lyrics sound like they would not be out of place coming from the \\"Back To  The Future\\" movie soundtrack.)<br /><br />But that aside, from an instrumental and songwriting point of view, \\"I&W\\" is anything but a disappointment. It is, after all, DT's breakthrough (both from a creative and commercial standpoint). Therefore, John Petrucci's fingerprints are all over this thing -- he fills it with great riffs, technically-impressive leads, and solos that a re just plain awe-inspiring. And the rest of the band complete the rhythm section with flowing bass lines and thoroughly crafty drumming.<br /><br />Dream Theater begin the album with \\"Pull Me Under,\\" a very Shakespeare-influenced opener with a dreamy (pun intended!) acoustic intro, before eventually locking into an aggressive, up-tempo, chunky riff-laden groove. DT also uncork a hooky, lurching beat, and a ripping melodic solo, here, as well. \\"Another Day\\" follows this, as a lovely acoustic ballad with a squealing, distinctly jazz-derived Soprano saxophone solo from well-respected smooth jazz artist Jay Beckenstein. This is then followed by another terrifically wailing guitar solo. But it is what comes next that takes the cake for being the first-half of the set's biggest highpoint. \\"Take The Time\\" is a really complex, eight-minute long power ballad with a pronounced, bubbling bass line, Iron Maiden-inspired, power metal-lite vocals, and miles of more delicious, melodic, air guitar-able shredding.  And later on in the song, the band delves into keyboard soloing, and even a piano enters the fray, too. \\"Surrounded\\" is another power ballad, but this one distinguishes itself from the rest of the pack in that it is driven by dramatic, and at times nearly-symphonic-sounding pianos and keyboards.<br /><br />But \\"Metropolis Pt. 1, The Miracle And The Sleeper\\" puts listeners back on aggressive territory, with its chunky, crunchy, staccato riffing, muscularly grumbling bass lines, and really dexterous drum fills. And when a bunch of mazy guitar solos, backing synth touches (which are added for extra ambiance), and a technical, warbling bass solo are added to the mix, the end result is an extremely epic and multi-faceted, nine-and-a-half minute-long epic of a song. \\"Under A Glass Moon\\" abides by a similarly catchy, staccato guitar groove, and technical bass lines (including a noteworthy bass interlude). And it also rips out two more terrific, multi-parted, and infectiously wailing guitar solos. But track seven, \\"Wait For Sleep,\\" which was written entirely by keyboardist Kevin Moore, comes next, and it is a ballad through and through, and one that is driven by dramatic, classical-sounding piano keys and warm, supple crooning. And \\"Learning To Live\\" is the next song after this, and it is clearly the pinnacle of the album. Why? Because not only is it the record's last track, it is an epically epic one that clocks in at a whopping 11.5 minutes in length. It features some technical, and beautifully jazzy (and, at times, almost flamenco-sounding) acoustic guitar picking, including an acoustic solo. And \\"Learning To Live\\" is further highlighted by another guitar solo, this one being a soaring, harmonized, skyscraper of an electric guitar solo.<br /><br />This reviewer is still partial to Dream Theater's 2009 effort, \\"Black Clouds And Silver Linings.\\" But if that implies to you anything other than the fact that \\"Images And Words\\" is not only an excellent progressive metal album, it a great album period, then the point has obviously been missed. And anybody that says this is anything less than a landmark release clearly does not know what they are talking about.that it is driven by dramatic, and at times nearly-symphonic-sounding pianos and keyboards.<br /><br />But \\"Metropolis Pt. 1, The Miracle And The Sleeper\\" puts listeners back on aggressive territory, with its chunky, crunchy, staccato riffing, muscularly grumbling bass lines, and really dexterous drum fills.

B008G12ERC|4.0|I do like this CD. I like the songs, most of the time. It is not a CD that I would play over and over again, It has a theatrical vibe, maybe like Queen or Rick Wakeman. The performances are good and strong, the recording crisp and clear, the vocals legible, which is important in this case. But I have not pieced the musicians style together yet. This is my first Muse CD. I will have to buy a couple of others to kind of get a more comprehensive connect going. I would listen to this CD at night, Traveling across the Country! I think that is where the Beauty will really shine, because I see it. I just got the CD so have not had the chance to experience it. Seeing a motorcycle on the showroom floor, is not the same thing as mounting it and riding it through all the gears and turns that the road may lead you on...So That's where I'm standing as I peel back the layers.

I was mainly interested and reading the timeline of events in the Legend of Zelda universe and I was pleasantly surprised and impressed to see all the concept art from each game. The illustrations are excellent and this was a great purchase at a great price.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Pay no attention to any commentary suggesting this book is blaming women for lack of progress in the workplace - not even close. Author Michael Lewis got it right in his short review of this book in the April 2013 Vanity Fair: watch out, men, the women are beginning to figure it out. This book presents a useful and valuable account of the author's own experiences and impressions and is full of warm encouragement.  It also has a beautifully crafted and edited presentation of scholarly research and analysis interlarded at all the right points.  The long list of acknowledgments and thanks at the end gives you an idea of how much attention was lavished on this book.  If everything the author works on at Google is as well thought out and presented as this book is, we should all be buying the company stock.

My only problem is that I wish some of the deleted scences were in the movie because it would follow more with the graphic novel and they are funny and hell. But even without that, I'm giving this movie 8 out of 5 but... it only goes up to 5 soooo, 5 out of 5 will have to do.

0385737955|4.0|Talk about adventure, intrigue, twists and turns!  James Dashner has it all in The Maze Runner (Book 1)!  They sold this book to me as a perfect companion to The Hunger Games and Divergent...let me start by saying, these books are not the same in my mind, but that is not to say anything negative about The Maze Runner.  It is still an amazing book that brings to life a new world that has yet to be discovered.  Think, Lord of the Flies meets the Hunger Games meets Ender's Game.  I know, I know, that's a huge variance, not to mention huuuuuuge shoes to fill!<br /><br />Maze Runner, follows Thomas, a young boy that finds himself awakening with no memories beyond his own name, in an elevator and opening up to a group of rugged boys that have been living in \\"the glade\\" for the past 2 years searching for a way out of the maze that surrounds their safe compound all while avoiding the scary Griever monsters who constantly chase the boys.  Will they find a way out with the help of bright, Thomas?  What of this new mysterious girl, Teresa,  who arrives in a coma and looks familiar to Thomas?  With twists and turns in this trilling book it's sure to keep you interested and on your toes.

B004DLPXAO|1.0|With 4.10.0.88, kindle randomly logs me out, resets my preferences, forgets my books, and has generally been less than useful.  When it works, the app is fine, but too often an update breaks it. ----------------  An update:  I tried the 4.1.1 version, and I guess it didn't crash as often.  The interface is still horrible though.  The home page is badly designed with too little information about my library and too much of Amazon trying to sell me things.  And it still has a problem displaying the text if I change the default.  I have several kindle store purchases that drop out words unless I change the font to the smallest/default setting.  It's like it can't figure out where the screen/page breaks should be at larger fonts and so doesn't display all of the words.  In addition, they've removed useful features:  -- You no longer see the name of the book and the chapter/story title when you center tap the screen.  Hello, McFly, some people read short story collections and knowing the title of the current short story is important.  -- Still takes too many clicks to get to the ToC.  It takes 4 clicks now.  It shouldn't take more than 2.  -- Books on the Device view defaults to large icons, basically two or three covers are all you can see at a time.  Features it *still* lacks:  -- Download all of my books in one click.  I've got a 32 gb sd card and wireless.  Like almost everyone else on the planet these days.  I shouldn't have to tap each book individually to download them.  There's easily room for over 250,000 novels on my device and I've got 100 MB wireless at work, 50 MB at home, and 4g.  It takes longer to tap than it does to download.  -- Configure my home page.  I'd like the home page to be books on my device, not your sales pitch.  Lord knows Amazon gets enough of my money, just let me read what I've bought.  And let me customize the view.  I don't always need cover thumbnails either.  Just a title, author if sorting by title or author, title if sorting by author should be an option.  Luckily I still have the last good apk from the 3.8 line.  I'll try newer versions every once in awhile, but I bet I'll be sticking with 3.8.  I wonder if there's calibre for android...  [original review of 4.0 follows]  The upgrade to 4.0 was horrible.  It locked up my phone, removed functionality, and basically made reading books purchased from Amazon impossible.  4.0.1.3 seems to have fixed the worst of the lockups, but it still doesn't work right.  I've got a Galaxy Note2 and simply paging through a book would lock up the reader to the point where I had to reboot my phone.  That hasn't happened as much in 4.0.1.3, but there are still plenty of pauses and stalls just in turning pages.  What is really bad is that I can't go to the table of contents any more.  On short story collections I purchased through Amazon, I used to be able to click on the menu button and go to the table of contents.  Now ToC is greyed out so I can't tap it.  The links to the ToC at the beginning of each story still work though.  I can't remember, but I think there are now more clicks to get to the ToC, even if it were working.  Hopefully Google will point me to a previous version, because this has made my purchases useless.

B00AQM8H9I|5.0|I think this is a really good basic game that I think could start to get addictive. It's one of those games that are good when you're bored. The games are really quick and best of all you can play with up to four other people (or play against the computer) and you can choose how many opponents you want. It's trickier than it looks but I think after playing more you'll have it down real quick and win every time. I'm not sure if it'd start getting boring pretty fast. The graphics look good, the size of the game isn't too bad 16mb and there was no lagging at all. I think it was a well made game.

B0052RDHTM|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. Every page I stumbled across historical events or ideology that resulted in me researching further and learning parts of history I would never have sought out. The characters walk you through the First World War in their own unique way, helping you understand how these events transpired and why the human race sank to such a low point.<br /><br />This book takes the glory out of war and makes you realize no one comes out a winner in the end. Thought provoking and well written.

B003ASLJO0|5.0|I don't have a large collection of movies but this is one that I needed to add to my collection
B009VYF5E2|5.0|I have enjoyed this entire series.<br />I enjoy the actors and think they were well cast for their parts.<br />I like this period in time and the King Arthur stories.  I have seen most all stories with Merlin as a main character but never have seen one where he is a boy and youth. Most all of the previous stories have shown him as an ageing wizard.  This series was in my opinion well done and different than the usual tale. This series may have wandered off from the myth that has been handed down in some parts but the show was well done.<br />There was also a lot of humor interjected throughout the series. If you enjoy this time period and wizards and such it is likely you will enjoy Merlin.

B00985E3UG|3.0|Worth reading, the book is well written and informative.  The arrangement of the book in three main parts--one big section each on salt, sugar, and fat--makes sense, but leaves the reader sick and tired of--well, salt, sugar and fat.  There is so much on each item, one grows a little weary of reading the same thing over and over.  (Not that the information is all the same; it's just that the same old story, so to speak, has occurred repeatedly with regard to the food industry and the psychological manipulation of the public.)

B00AZMFO6I|3.0|\\"Quartet\\" tells the story of 4 former opera singers who, having grown old, are residing in an assisted living facility in England. There is plenty of drama as they, and other musicians and singers, prepare for an annual concert fundraiser that will literally save their home. Old flames face off over decades-old affairs, prima donnas have not grown mellower with age, and sickness threatens to derail everyone's plans. It was wonderful that so many actual opera and music stars of past years participated in the film.<br /><br />Now, the downside.<br /><br />It was more than a little unbelievable that elderly singers were able to belt out arias as well as they could in their prime. Overdubbing was rampant. Decades-long doubts and animosities were vanquished in a trice. Debilitating sicknesses disappeared miraculously just in the time for the big show. \\"Quartet\\" is the kind of film that gets it laughs from seeing old folks drop F-bombs and from elderly men urinating in public and acting like horny teenagers. Not much effort went into trying to make the situations believable. The able actors, notably Maggie Smith, mostly mug their way through their scenes. Michael Gambon, dressed in Oriental gown jacket and cap, seems to reprise his role as Aldus Dumbledore, sans the beard and glasses. Thumbs down to Dustin Hoffman as the film's director.<br /><br />Still, the audience, made up of mostly of the elderly, loved the movie and gave it an ovation at the end. \\"Quartet\\" is a sweet movie that  could have been something, if only it had tried.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love it!

Now three years later, we get the second album of OMD's rebirth.<br /><br />\\"English Electric\\" (12 tracks; 43 min.) starts off with a quick intro \\"Please Remain Seated\\" (reminding me of that classic Laurie Anderson track \\"From the Air\\"), which then gives way to the epic 7+ min. \\"Metroland\\", which immediately sounds Kraftwerk-ish in its sound and structure. If you dig Kraftwerk (as do I), you will love this. \\"Night Cafe\\" sounds a bit too polished for me. Give me instead the next track (and mostly instrumental) \\"The Future Will Be Silent\\", with some bite to it. \\"Helen of Troy\\" reminds of \\"Joan of Arc\\" at a higher speed. THE highlight of the album for me is \\"Kissing the Machine\\", co-written by Andy McCluskey and ex-Kraftwerk's Karl Bartos. The song is the absolute perfect middle-ground between Kraftwerk and OMD. Sandwiched between two more short intervals is the last highlight of the album, \\"Dresden\\". In all, this album continues the rebound/rebirth of OMD, and then some!<br /><br />A quick further comment on the Kraftwerk/Bartos connections: last Fall, a pleasant and thorough Kraftwerk bio-book (authored by David Buckley) was published called \\"Kraftwerk: Publikation\\" and Andy McCluskey is quoted in there multiple times, gushing about his love for the German band. Last month Karl Bartos released a very well received solo album and do you want to guess who gave a helping hand? I've seen OMD in concert only once in my life time, back in September of 1979 when they opened for Gary Numan at the Hammersmith Odeon (London), they were a duo then (Andy and Paul), playing live with a reel-to-reel tape player to get the full band sound. They'd be breaking big not long after that. I am surely hoping to catch them here in the US on their tour in support of this new album. Meanwhile, \\"English Electric\\" is a most welcome addition to the OMD catalog.. Meanwhile, \\"English Electric\\" is a most welcome addition to the OMD catalog.

1936891026|5.0|This book is a phenomenal guide to getting your life's work on track, to getting your mind focused on the real issues preventing you from being who you are, and to getting you to invoke the muses with a series of simple (but often painful) life changes.<br /><br />The book is a quick read, but it is one that you will have to read again and again to grasp thoughtfully.  In other words, each point the author brings up needs to be applied to you personally and then pondered for a while to see how much sense Pressfield is really making.<br /><br />This book will introduce you to the almost/arguably metaphysical force of Resistance.  Then remind you of the ancient concepts of the Muses.  Are they real or imagined?  Does it matter?  A force akin to them exists.  But how do you tap into it?  It's not magic.  It's not even fun.  It involves resolve, hard work, and trust.<br /><br />I'd say the most frustrating aspect of this book is how much it reveals about oneself that one may not like to accept.  How much Resistance has overcome one, caused one to stray from one's dreams, and inserted a vapid alternate lifestyle in place of one's true calling.<br /><br />This book has a no nonsense approach.  It is not wordy or self-congratulatory, like so many other \\"self-help\\" tomes.  It gets down to business and asks you to put up or shut up.  Pressfield points out the facts and basically says, \\"What are you going to do about this?  It is screwing over your life!\\"<br /><br />The chapters are tiny, yet full of poignant messages and examples.  Very interesting topics and admonitions abound in this little text.  You will want to reread them and think on your own lifestyle in the light of their messages.<br /><br />Pretty cool, profound little book.  Highly recommended.  But do not expect to feel total joy after reading it.  Your true self is gonna need work.

B001ANSSDC|5.0|The Silver Lining Playbook is one of the most beautiful stories that I have ever read. Pat Peoples is a wonderfully messed up character. Definitely read it!
B00A81MV3U|5.0|Equal parts love story and family-dynamics drama with a generous sprinkling of laugh out loud moments. Silver linings playbook is the story of two people Pat and Tiffany struggling with emotional issues and desperately in love with their unattainable spouses: both feel responsible for the incidents that separated them from their first loves. From the moment they set eyes on each other the chemistry is electric. Much of the humor is due to the fact that neither has much of a filter, yet both have a vulnerability and kindness, in addition to a keen intellect and sharp wit.<br /><br />The family relationship between Pat and his mother and his OCD father (played by Robert Di Niro, brilliant as always) is vocal and intense and at times hilarious. Other characters are his wise but unconventional therapist and his friend from the hospital. Love how the friendship and romance builds in this story of fallible people trying not to fall in love. Buy don't rent it. If you're like me you'll want to watch it over and over again.

B009NG1Q96|3.0|First, let me just say, I positively loved the first book. I had never read anything like it before, and I loved the love triangle between America, Aspen, and Maxon. Personally, I think that Maxon is better: he's sweeter and more handsome.<br />No that I got over the fact that I love the overall series, let me just say that America was an idiot in this book. She lost most of the backbone she had had in the Selection, and **spoiler alert** nearly got sent home for proposing that they remove the caste system on live tv. Overall, she was much less then the heroine that she was in the first book. I almost wanted Kriss to win!<br />The Elite also revealed some aspects of Marlee and Maxon that I really thought took away from the story. Overall, it was a good book, but this time around I really didn't like the characters.
1451695195|5.0|If I was granted the wish that every human being would read one book which I nominated, this would be the one. As author of 'The BIG Picture - Insights from the Spiritual World', I was left in awe at just how magnifently Eben Alexander conveyed the profundity of that same big picture from his vantage point. This is the most hope-filled conception of existence possible. I am left with this huge cosmic picture of the love and compassion that permeates all... and over there is the wee Earth, wrestling with good and evil in order to fulfil humanity's task to bring about freedom. And yet to have the conviction in the midst of all that seems so wrong, that in fact all is as it needs to be, that we are loved and can do no wrong, is an incredibly powerful anchor to live a life of authenticity and honourable endeavour. From the pinnacle of science to the pinnacle of life - well done. Garry Gilfoy, Author [[ASIN:1462071074 The Big Picture: Insights from the Spiritual World]]

B001TIQT98|5.0|Look at this - after nearly half a century, Leonard Bernstein Mahler cycle continues to generate  the same degree of passion that it did after the individual performances were released. My initiation to Mahler's sound world was through Bruno Walter's performance of Mahler 1, on the 1970s Columbia Odyssey budget reissue picturing a marble Prometheus (Titan? Get it?) From the opening notes, I was transfixed - as I travelled thorugh a soundscape that sounded at once different, yet oddly familiar, to classical/romantic works I had heard up till that point.<br /><br />Breaking my personal college budget, I then purchased Bernstein's boxed set of symphonies 1, 6, and 9. Bernstein's performance of #1 held me in awe; the playing of the NYP blew me away, I felt like a great mystical secret that had laid dormant within this score had been revealed to me. The Sixth remained more problematic for me at that point in life. The Ninth, however, brought me to tears. I followed these Bernstein performances, and the others in the cycle, through their various incarnations, up through the Bernstein Century and Royal Edition releases, in hope of improvement to the dismal Columbia sound quality heard on both vinyl and CDs.<br /><br />Awash in Bernstein - including his generally great DG cycle - I postponed re-acquianting myself with his earlier cycle. I avoided the the box set with the garish portrait on the cover, not expecting to hear any improved sonics, and read the reviews of this set with apprehension when it appeared. \\"Best sound quality yet\\" means little when the original themselves were so mediocre to begin with.<br /><br />Well, this past week a price drop on a copy listed here compelled me to give it a shot - and boy, am I glad that I did! These recordings are like canvasses that have had a layer of old, yellowing varnish removed. The sound is fully dimensional, and there is more \\"air\\" in the recording. I wouldn't have thought it possible, but these recordings have been given new life, and will gain new fans, and truly become immortal.<br /><br />As for the packaging, well, what can I say. I am generally a fan of cardboard box sets, but I truly despise Sony's use of heavy, cardboard sleeves, clumsily pasted together at the seam, and both cumbersome and threatening to the CD surface in the gatefold two-fers. If this set had been part of the Original Jacket Collection (as well it should have been) the sleeves would have been an integral part of the set's design.  As it stands, the sleeves are not terribly attractive and I did not agonize for long before placing the discs in double-sided Case Logic style storage sleeves. This also free up a tremendous amount of space in the box, allowing me to store the discs in the Bernstein/Resurrection/LSO performance + Baker's Kindertotenlieder, [[ASIN:B00000DS72 Mahler: Symphony No. 2 - Resurrection / Kindertotenlieder]] as well as the discs in the  Mahler Lieder Box set [[ASIN:B000L6DECO Leonard Bernstein - A Portrait: Mahler: Lieder]].  Booklets too. I now have my \\"ultimate\\" Bernstein/Mahler Box.<br /><br />For those who prefer Bertini, what can I say...they are glorious recordings but lack the passion, the vision, the overall comittment of these performances. For those who prefer Solti's bombast (and I admit that back in those same college days, my allegiance to Bernstein was superceded by the sonics of the Solti cycle) I say, listen to the individualism and spirituality of these performances. For those who are Mahler neophytes, I say - start with this cycle as a frame of reference for a lifetime of listening.<br /><br />For better or for worse: Leonard Bernstein was synonymous with Gustav Mahler for the latter part of the 20th century. These reviews are also proof that his legacy is alive and well. Listen to these recordings and discover the reasons why this is true.ew life, and will gain new fans, and truly become immortal.<br /><br />As for the packaging, well, what can I say.

B009UNGYHG|4.0|This charge case has been excellent at both providing a place to stash my headset, and charging when in a pinch.  My only gripe is that the headset doesn't always charge right away, I find I must often push it against the contacts very firmly, then ensure the case isn't jarred.  I initially bought the case because the whole &#34;magnetic&#34; charging system had frustrated me more than once.  I'd leave the headset attached to the charger, seemingly charging... Only to grab the unit before a multiple-hour conference call the next day and have it announce the battery was critically low.  Thought this would alleviate the uncertainty as to whether or not the headset was charging.  And, it has as I can more easily see whether it truly is charging (via the indicator lights). Perhaps mine is an isolated problem but thought it would be worth mentioning.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|The book is so great. This is the second time I read it. Ready Player one makes me feel so good. I love the characters, the 80's references and all the geeky information it gives you.

B000AAF1U4|5.0|This is a moderate quality scan of the film. Not much in the way of extras. The sound is excellent, the video is widescreen but lacks pop and crispness. This is about the only David Spade film I like, but it is absolutely a David Spade film, so if you don't like him, avoid this.

B00AGJ4HC2|5.0|This game is so simple and so fun! Anyone can pick it up in less than a couple minutes. It gives me the same sort of feeling that I get when playing a game like [[ASIN:B008A2BA8G Resistance The 2nd Edition]], only you don't have to have a huge number of people to play it. So, that means it will hit the table far more frequently. Which is a big plus in my book. The ability to deceive your friends, and then turn around and back stab them is so fantastic! The only complaint I have about this game is that the card quality is not that great. The cards are quite thin, and seem like they will crease rather easily if not handled properly. However, I am still giving this product 5 stars due to it's low cost, quick game play, and huge amount of fun. FYI: I got it for under ten bucks at my local game store. Go get yourself a copy, you won't regret it!

1572704497|3.0|And Then There Were None is perhaps the most \\"closed-room\\" of the many \\"closed-room\\" mysteries Agatha Christie wrote.  Ten people are invited to a privately-owned island by a mysterious and unknown party.  Each is harboring a guilty secret from their past, which is revealed on the first evening by a phonograph recording supplied by -- again -- an unknown party.  Each person vigorously insists on their own innocence and almost immediately the deaths begin.  Over the course of the next few days each person dies, one after another.<br /><br />This is almost the only Agatha Christie of the many I read years ago, in which I remembered who the guilty party was.  So that ruined the suspense for me somewhat, since I knew all along who was behind all the deaths.  However, even had I not known I think the excessive improbability of the whole plot would have turned me off a bit.  One doesn't expect an Agatha Christie mystery to read like a true crime story -- they are read for entertainment, after all.  Still, this one was contrived to the point of ridiculousness.  The behavior of the ten people, too, was ridiculous; it is not until there are only three or four people left that they begin to act a little bit as you would expect.  Throughout the first several murderers everyone seemed totally non-plussed, taking it completely in stride and turning amateur detective.  And then there was the gimmick of patterning the whole thing after the nursery rhyme Ten Little Indians, which all of the characters got completely caught up in.  It was truly eye-rolling.<br /><br />This is probably the most \\"creative\\" of Agatha Christie's plots, but not the best of her mysteries.<br /><br />Hugh Fraser, however, is one of the best narrators.  I have listened to him on several Agatha Christie books and he always does an excellent job.
0312117337|1.0|I bought these cards a few years ago. I loved the ideas (titles of cards like \\"schizophrenia\\" and \\"break through\\") and the images are the most beautiful I have seen on any deck. However, as I continued to read these cards I found that they were so negative and not accurate at all. There is a definite imbalance of positive and negative cards that leaves a person getting mostly negative projections of themselves and the future. When I discovered who OSHO really was, I was floored. No wonder these cards carry around negatively and project only shortcomings onto a conscientious person! He was the drug addicted cult leader, Rajneesh, that was jailed and deported from the U.S. for poisoning and scamming people ([...] I didn't even offer these cards to a friend, I just threw them out and instantly felt lighter with them gone. This deck, and him, are great examples of how people get misled. The placebo effect is alive and well in the New Age industry and it is really hard to know sometimes when we come across truth or lies because we are programmed to feel more spiritual just by having and using tools and seeing pretty images. I stick to the basics now for accurate readings. The rider-waite is pretty much flawless, though it does not have the fancy bells and whistles. I also stay away from any deck made by Hayhouse and Doreen Virtue, those cards are made for the same, a corporate bottom line, and are also imbalanced when it comes to positive and negative. When using a deck, you don't need to know what someone wants you to believe, you want to know the truth. You will get a lot more truth from a basic deck that was not made purely for profits and mind control.<br /><br />Though OSHO is no longer alive, his cult is still alive and well and making millions off of people who do not know he is Rajneesh because he changed his name after he left the U.S.. No matter if someone has one grain of truth, it does not mean the rest of his grains are true as well. In like, just because these cards are beautiful and have cutting edge ideas, does not mean they read accurately or are helpful in any way.<br /><br />Please stay away from this deck and make sure to research the people who publish and create your divination tools, it makes all the difference in the world on accuracy.

B00B2DSK06|5.0|This movie was fun to watch and often hilarious especially if you remember the 80's. But it is also fun for the kiddos.<br />The music in Wreck It often has a subtle 80's background tone to it and oozes &#34;80's arcade&#34; which I appreciated. The storyline is solid enough and enjoyable. The dialog is frequently very funny. And certain scenarios are laugh-out-loud funny. In particular, the backstory of Jane Lynch's character, Calhoun, was hilarious IMHO.<br /><br />It's frequently interesting to see how the voice actors are cast and how they handle the dialog. Sometimes &#34;big names&#34; are cast just for the potential audience draw. In this case I feel the actors let enough of their personalities show through to be effective vs. taking the other option of strictly reading from a script.<br /><br />Are there issues with this movie? Sure. But I was having too much fun watching it to really have any complaints.<br /><br />As for the  kids: they love it and would watch it over and over again if they could. Fine for 3-4 YO and up. Ideal for 5 and above.

B004NROYUI|5.0|I love my Fuji X100 camera and this case is a perfect fit. The X100 is styled like the classic range finder camera, something my parents would have used in the 50s & 60s and this case fits the retro style of the camera.<br /><br />It fits the camera like a glove and I like how the top protion is removeable at the flick of a snap. Also the way the top portion folds up and over the camera and down when ready to shoot is very handy.<br /><br />Yeah it pricey but what isn't in photography? I just had to have it.

B00CJ6RJU2|5.0|First of all, may I just say here and now that, apparently if you already watch and enjoy the BBC Sherlock series, you will be inclined to hate this one. I am not entirely sure why, but just to prove my point, look up all the 1 and 2 star reviews of Elementary here and count how many times the BBC show or it's actors are mentioned. Then go to the 5 star reviews and notice the depth of critique and the simultaneous lack of comparison to another show's take on Sherlock Holmes.<br /><br />Okay. That aside:<br /><br />This show is exceptional. Not only would it stand alone quite well without Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes ever having been written (which to some insults their ideas and affinities for SACD's work), but also adds societal context, modernity, and depth to Sherlock Holmes (something no one can say is easy, much less executable in such an artistic and subtle way as this series).<br /><br />MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD!!!<br /><br />First, let us look at trying to place such a genius intellect and deductionist in today's cynical, apathetic, passive, low resolve and high civil retaliation context of modern London. This is where we must put a modern day Holmes, from his infancy up to his (SPOILER ALERT) inevitable heroine addiction. In the early London of Sir Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, there was this resolve, this popular tenacity in London, not to mention a clear cut notion of right and wrong, that permeated it's core culture and drive. A young man with Sherlock Holmes' gifts would have found quite a station and calling as he grew up in the higher learning institutions and accepting fields of forensics, police work, and medicine with their backdrop of solid morality and unwavering credos. He would have undoubtably arisen as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's main man as written. Logic trumps superstition and evil manipulation.<br />Now let us compare that same intellect, growing up in the morally empty, cynical, awkward avoiding culture of today's London. He, like many who dare to cling to what is right and shun what is wrong, end up shunned themselves; usually living alone with their non-utilized giftings, or moving somewhere where they may be exercised. Sherlock grows up cynical, brash, and arrogant (increasingly popular in London these days as potential and drive is squandered, replaced by entertainment and erased morals/sense of station). In this context, Sherlock Holmes arises as a frustrated genius young man who finds his only shelter lay in his crime foiling deductions and in the arms of a young woman whom he finds he can love-Irene.<br />SPOILER: Irene is murdred by &#34;M&#34;. A serial killer eventually known as Moriarty.<br />Holmes then turns to Heroine and then loses His other shelter-Scotland Yard.<br />In the opening episode of ELEMENTARY, Sherlock has moved from London to New York, where he has just begun consulting for the NYPD. He had a destructive addiction to injecting heroine while working for Scotland Yard and was eventually forced to retire. His father now pays for him to live in an apartment called the Brownstone (in New York) where his sober companion, Joan Watson, lives with him in a non romantic professional relationship. Watson and Holmes sharpen each other. Watson keeps Holmes accountable. Holmes begins truing Watson in the art of Deduction.<br /><br />Elementary's Sherlock Holmes feels out of place and alone in a world where he sees more than anyone else. Appropriate for a man like this in these modern times. A genius in the middle of a new breed of culture that shuns excellence for the comfort of mediocrity, and he knows it. This is revisited many times throughout the first 20 episodes.<br /><br />This Sherlock Holmes lives a balance of escaping the tensions of this reality through debauchery (Prostitutes) and hyperkinetic medicating through constant activity (learning to pick locks and handcuffs, single stick fighting, watching 6 televisions at once, etc.) and his using his gifts of observationand deduction for good (good being very real and constant for him as so many shows today seem to despise).<br /><br />This Sherlock is daily confronted with reality, both in the horrors he must do his best to prevent from happening again (Putting murderers out of the public domain), and in his addictive tendencies in dealing with pain. Sherlock does not run from his pain. He instead operates in the other two self destructive ways of handling pain. He shuts off emotionally and he medicates. The writers do an exceptional job in having Holmes respond to pain like a normal, albeit a genius of dynamic proportions, human being and Watson is the perfect counterpart to His medicating and shutting off emotionally. She keeps him focused on the only healing way to deal with pain. Feel it.<br /><br />Aside from these things, Elementary also stands as one of the best &#34;whodunnit&#34; shows ever. The crimes are complex, the clues are given in a way as to have your own deductionist skills sharpened, and the plot twists are more often than not unexpected.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />1) Great writing.<br />2) Great characters that can be related to.<br />3) Great job articulating a modern Sherlock.ows today seem to despise).

B006KP3XCQ|5.0|This is not just a cartoon neither it is only to entertain kids...Besides being really cute and well done there is an important message that is shared about the need to better care for our planet. It points out the irresponsible way human beings have been dealing with Mother Nature and it shows the results of such way of living. It points out also the problems ever increasing of an over consuming and inactive society relying too much on \\"machines\\" to do the work...and it shows how this way of living is turning against mankind.<br />Great lessons can be taken from this cartoon; hopefully it will awaken people to go in the right direction....<br /><br />I appreciated the Eco friendly Dvd case; it was somewhat crushed but really it is not a problem the Dvd was perfectly fine and I didn't mind.<br /><br />I do recommend Wall-e as it is entertaining but at the same time educational!
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Great season of a great show! The product is what you expect, although not as fancy as the season 1 cover. Don't watch the special features until you've completed the season - spoilers! The first season features included character summaries that you could read - very helpful. This season doesn't seem to have a similar feature.
B008JFUO9K|5.0|IRON MAN III -  Robert Downey, Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Guy Pearce, Rebecca Hall, Stephanie Szostak, James Badge Dale, Jon Favreau, Ben Kingsley<br /><br />Premise: One year after the harrowing events of \\"The Avengers\\", Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) is a changed man - he's seen things and now they're taking a toll on his psyche and his relationship with Pepper (Paltrow). When the Mandarin (Kingsley) initiates a series of terrorist attacks against the United States, tragedy hits home for Stark - stirring him to action. As Stark investigates this new foe, he learns about the technological program known as \\"Extremis\\" which brings him against a new line of cyber-enhanced foes that might be more than a match for Iron Man...<br /><br />Thoughts: Iron Man III is Marvel's unveiling of \\"Phase II\\" - the lead up to Avengers II - and it presents a subtly different take on Tony Stark/Iron Man. Taking over directorial duties for Jon Favreau is Shane Black (the acclaimed inventor of the Buddy Cop genre with his screenplay for Lethal Weapon), who brings a sharp flair for humorous quirk and sharp wit, which complements Robert Downey Jr.'s performance and enhances it. This film retains the charm of its predecessors while diving head into an exceptionally exciting genre: the technological thriller. On this third go around, the cast gels - Cheadle, Paltrow, Favreau and Downey all hit the ground running. The new additions (Pearce, Kingsley, and Hall) all act as very strong foils to each of the main cast and help develop the acclaimed \\"Extremis\\" story line from the comics. That said, certain stylistic elements were questionable: such as the Mandarin's voice - which has heavily reminiscent of Heath Ledger's Joker - gets a tad old quickly but with purpose. However, this is overshadowed by better choices: such as Tony's friendship with a young boy named Harley, which illustrates a side of him we have not scene before. The film is full of unexpected surprises and touching emotional moments which make this film a must see. And like all Marvel films, be sure to stick around for after the credits for a nice little post-credit scene involving a character we have seen before in a surprising situation. ;)<br /><br />Should you buy this film? Absolutely. Iron Man III is the first \\"Must See\\" summer blockbuster and it more than redeems Marvel for their last solo Iron Man film, which felt more like a commercial and less like a movie. Exceptionally crafted, brilliantly directed and realistically dealing with the \\"why not just call the Avengers\\" problem in a satisfying manner, this film will be a great collection for any fan of comics, Downey Jr. or Shane Black. For best viewing - get the Bluray: you'll get a DVD copy and a Digital copy so you can watch on the go - well worth the extra definition on the television.ts which make this film a must see.

B00BO2VKBG|5.0|I've been listening to this out in a dilapidated shed on the corner of my property. My amp and speakers have gathered quite a bit of dust. They're set on a stack of cinder blocks to save them from being claimed by the damp and rotting floor. The musky scent can be a bit overwhelming. There's no proper outlets, so this whole horrible setup has been powered with illegal electricity. Still, this record sounds amazing. \\"Desert Ceremony\\" and \\"Devil's Work\\" are the standouts for me. It's as good as Blood Lust.
B001UV4XWY|3.0|movies like this are made for a certain audience, which is why films like these usually fail miserably, then become cult classics a decade later. The mainstream movie crowd, not the niche corner market of film festival jerks, but the common folk, just aren't going to buy into this, walk out thirty through, or find it utterly appalling. It's ok. Not everything can be a Cohen Bros 'brilliance' as the elite call their films or a Bay mega ride.<br /><br />I kind of like that only a few will get it. Let their mind wander a bit in make believe and escape in characters and a sci fi epic that slipped through so many fingers.  In fact I am still trying to make sense of it, and I will watch it three, four more times to really appreciate it. Sadly I have to give it three stars for now, but still quite good.

B00C2VIA52|3.0|This is a fairly decent game, being an avid strategic card game player. But it has  its flaws. For one thing, it's impossible to finish a ranked game. It always freezes, and forces me to quit, taking away &quot;league points&quot;. On top of that, the way to get cards is strange. You want a certain card? Then keep on wishing, because you get all your cards randomly. On the plus side, this always poses a challenge, as I'm well into the campaign.

0525478817|4.0|The Fault in Our Stars is the achingly beautiful story of 16 year old cancer survivor, Hazel Grace Lancaster. Hazel was diagnosed with Stage IV thyroid cancer at 13 but has exceeded her life expectancy with the help of an oxygen tank and experimental drugs. When her mother suspects that Hazel is succumbing to depression she urges her to join a Cancer Support Group. While at support group she meets Augustus Waters who is gorgeous and hopelessly smitten with Hazel. What follows is a moving story of growth, sacrifice and loss. Hazel and Augustus are two of my favorite fictional characters. They are witty, brave and selfless. I highly recommend this book. Another fine novel from John Green!

B008XG1X18|1.0|I’m a big fan of pinterest and love using it on my desktop. I have a little tooltip on my internet toolbar that let’s me pin things to my boards as I browse. It is so quick and easy to use. So I was happy to find this app for my Kindle Fire, because I assumed it would be an easy way for me to pin stuff to my boards while playing around with my Fire.<br /><br />I was wrong.<br /><br />First, the app didn’t recognize my login credentials on multiple tries. Even after finally getting it to recognize me, it would occasionally require me to sign in again (similar to if you have cookies deactivated on your desktop) just because I switched between my boards.<br /><br />Second, it freezes up a lot. It just stops responding and the only way to clear it is to turn the Kindle off and back on.<br /><br />Third, pinning is cumbersome. On the desktop, I can just click my “pin it” button on my toolbar and a pop up window opens that lets me select which board I want to pin to and add comments. Pinning anything through this app is a complicated mess. Combined with the constant having to sign-in because it doesn’t recognize my credentials, I just give up and don’t pin.<br /><br />Love the site. Hate the app.

B00BAYLQI0|5.0|It's nearly impossible not to be moved by THE IMPOSSIBLE.  The true story of a family's desperate attempt to survive and re-unite after the devastating tsunami that hit Thailand in 2004 is tragic yet uplifting and emotionally satisfying.<br />Oscar nominated Naomi Watts gives a remarkably controlled performance as the courageous mother as does Ewan McGregor as the determined father.  But it's newcomer Tom Holland as their eldest son Lucas who provides the heart of the movie.  His transition from carefree youth to dedicated savior is brutally realistic---Holland should have a bright cinematic future.<br />Special effects are used sparingly but do have a potent impact.  THE IMPOSSIBLE is not a CGI laden disaster flick but an engrossing examination of the strength of the family unit.  I recommend it.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|i bought this used for a good price, and i guess they had lost there used copy so not only did they get a new copy for me, but even sent  a note explaining it all for the same price, good service all around.

B00846REIS|2.0|Even though I am only half through the book, I find it involves too much sex. Wasn't what I was expecting.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|Zero Dark Thirty does the impossible. Takes a story where the viewer knows the ending and still delivers surprises. Should have won more awards, but got caught up in politics. Jessica Chastain superb, but so is everyone else. More than a hunt for Bin Laden, it shows the almost inhuman efforts that were needed to put a million separate clues together. A thriller with several jump out of the seat shockers. Much better than The Hurt Locker -- and Chastain won the Oscar for that!
B0095P29EG|5.0|Love this movie! Tom Hiddleston is the best villain ever. I would watch him do anything. Loki is a great villain.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Beautiful Disaster is Definitely a Beautiful Disaster!!<br /><br />Abby Abernathy is starting Fresh, where no one (except her BFF America) knows who or whats in her past. She wants everyone to think she is sweet and innocent. Then Travis \\"Mad Dog\\" Maddox comes crashing into her life.<br />Travis is the Campus hot shot, fighting, Walking One night Stand, you has all the girls giggling & willing to drop their panties for a chance with him. Travis has his own demons he's hiding from and the last thing he wants or expects is to fall for a Girl.<br /><br />The story is well written and flows well. The relationship between Abby & Travis is very intense & at time Volatile. You find yourself wanting them to get on the same page & just when you think they are Something seems to happen (Travis is really good at pissing you off).<br />The secondary characters are for the most part a nice calming relationship compared to the intensity of Abby & Travis.<br />I definitely recommend reading this book. I have heard that you either love it or hate it, and I am in the LOVE IT Camp!

B0091REZMW|4.0|I enjoy this game. There are several ways to play and many levels. My Kindle Fire works well with the graphics of the game.
B00004TS0E|3.0|I guess it's one of those things where the remake just doesn't measure up to the classic version. All the hoopla over the Macy's parade was more believable in the 50's version... I guess things are more jaded now. Still not a bad movie... just not as good as the original.

0756407915|2.0|The main problem I have with this book is the way in which it is written: first-person. For the majority, the narrator, Kvothe, is recounting his story. This takes away any sense of danger because we know, no matter what happened to him when he was a teen, he survived it because, well, he's telling us the story as an adult.<br /><br />Another problem with this style is, well, he's telling us a lot of annoying, seemingly pointless crap that could be glossed over. Since he's telling us in what feels like real time, and the book is forty-two hours long (and is subtitled \\"Day Two\\")...well, can you see the problem? There are only twenty-four hours in a day. I can't imagine anyone taking nearly two entire days to tell only part of a story, and I sure as heck can't imagine anyone wanting to listen for that long with basically no payoff.<br /><br />After finishing the first book, \\"The Name of the Wind,\\" I had trouble remembering what it was even about. This book is worse in that regard. I think Kvothe is looking for the creatures that killed his parents, but he does little to actually accomplish that. Instead he's running around having sex with fairies and drinking with his friends every day.<br /><br />I confess I couldn't finish this book. I got around halfway and just gave up. It felt like it was going nowhere, and Rothfuss's over-reliance on adverbs drove me crazy. I guess he never read Stephen King's \\"On Writing.\\" Adverbs are the devil, Rothfuss.

B000QCS8TW|4.0|Several friends had told me that I would LOVE G. R. R. Martin's Ice and Fire series, so I was predisposed to be impressed. I had held off reading it because a) it isn't finished - there are at least two more books yet to be written, and b) with five books already in the series, averaging 800 pages, I wanted to be sure I was ready for the commitment. After watching the first two seasons on HBO I couldn't hold out any longer - and I'm glad I didn't.<br /><br />The story is richly imagined and meticulously detailed, feeling more like a forgotten history than a fantasy novel. The characters, both good and bad (lots of these) are fully drawn, at least the significant ones (LOTS of these). Whether you like someone or hate them, you'll be very clear about why.<br /><br />The scope of this book is huge; there are Seven Kingdoms just on the first continent you encounter, and there will be at least one more. Conditions are deteriorating quickly for the residents of these lands, with war breaking out all over. Folks get taken hostage, injured, enslaved...there isn't a lot of happiness here.<br /><br />One thing that might be a problem for some is that each chapter is about a different character, all told in the third person. This can be a bit disorienting until you start getting the people straight (watching the TV show was a BIG help here - I already had visuals of the people). There are a LOT of characters; I suggest writing them down with a little bio. There are lists available online, but I found that seeing ALL of them at once was more overwhelming than helpful. If you write down the name, the House to which they belong, and their place of origin, it should be enough to keep you from getting too confused.<br /><br />Some other things that may not be to everyone's taste: the violence, the sex, and the language. Some of the things described here make &#34;Braveheart&#34; seem light and happy, the sex is plentiful, graphic, and taboo-breaking, and there are words here that, in general, I try not to even think, yet alone use. But the thing is...it works. It's awful, but in context. If these sorts of things don't generally bother you, you'll be fine. Even if they do, the strength of the writing most likely will carry you along, drawn by the need to know what becomes of Daenarys, or Arya, or Bran, or...well, you get the idea.<br /><br />This is a fantasy novel for those who don't generally read them - which includes me. I started (and pretty much ended) my interest in this genre with &#34;The Lord of the Rings&#34;. After you've read the best, why read the rest? Well, now I know why; because there are whole new worlds out there, and they're worth exploring.in general, I try not to even think, yet alone use. But the thing is...it works.

B008N5UX9M|2.0|Yes, this album should shut up all those that say that Steve Harris IS Iron Maiden. Steve may be the main composer in Maiden, but British Lion proves that he can't achieve the extraordinary level of an Iron Maiden album by himself. He DOES need the other 5 guys.<br />Also, it dissapoints that Harris got this singer, Richard Taylor, for the album. The difference between Bruce Dickinson and this guy is like the difference between a Ferrari and a beat up bicycle. I'm not saying Bruce should have been on the album, but that Steve should have known what fans expected of him and gotten a decent singer. Even Blaze Bailey is a good singer, he didn't have the energy and the connection to the fans that a lead singer in Iron Maiden requires, but Blaze Bailey CAN sing. I don't know who told this Richard Taylor that he could sing!!

B0043KK4N6|5.0|I was not a Christina Aguilera fan until I saw this movie.  I love watching the movie, I love the music and I found a better perspective since Christina wrote several of the songs! She definitely is no silly girl singer with no depth! The songs and movie prooved she has incredible talent and vocal range.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|As a HO game it was great.  The story like sucked though and it irritated me just enough that I almost let this one<br />slide and almost deleted it. It needed a better quality story line.

0142406112|5.0|Okay I understand that these books are aimed towards teens/children however I am 21 and I absolutely LOVE this whole series!<br /><br />I first read Point Blanc as it was a free book that was included on my iPad as I was given my friends old iPad when he bought a new one.  Point Blanc really brought me into the whole series as it was riveting.<br /><br />As for this book, it started a little slow as it had to do some character development and plot setting but Horowitz has the ability to really get the story rolling even while \\"the boring stuff\\" is happening.  If i wasn't told that this was a children's book, it could easily pass a an adult \\"quick read\\".  I actually was on a series of car rides as I was going on vacation in Arizona/Utah so as i was riding along in the car, i knocked out this book pretty quickly.<br /><br />Overall, this really is a great book for adults and kids alike.  I cannot suggest it highly enough!

B002HJ9PTO|4.0|I have used this mic for interviews and the sound is very clean with very very minor noise. In fact I think it is much cleaner than even the Olympus LS-10 I used to record the mic with.<br />For the price you can't beat it, but don't rely on this as your primary audio mic.<br />Here are the cons which are simply examples of  &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;<br />1. The chord. If you thought your iPhone ear buds got tangled then good luck with this. I used an old ribbon spool to store this.<br />2. The switch. This is the number one complaint because it is marginal at best. You have to turn it on and off a few times to get the audio to pass through and I have had people simply touch the unit and the audio goes to hell. YOU MUST MONITOR this mic or risk losing your audio!!!!!!! I tell everyone not to touch the unit.<br />3. The wind filter falls off. I lost mine already before I got my first interview done.<br />4. The battery is hard to remove.<br />5. No LED indicator. This part blows because you don't know if the mic is on or not and it's easy to forget about the switch when you have so much more going on.<br /><br />Still, you cannot beat the quality for the price. I recommend adding two-three in your cart for backup.

The BluRay plays great on the computer or on a set top BluRay player (OPPO BDP 103--see reviews on Amazon for this 5 Star Player).<br /><br />The movie is a semi-prequel to Alien and rather explains how the aliens came to be.  Acting is excellent and the whole concept of the film, very plausible.<br /><br />Definitely a 5 Star Sci-Fi Movie

B00B7IJBUY|1.0|Bon Jovi might was well cross over to the country charts with this album.  Make it official...the creative rock and roll juices of this band has died. About as exciting and captivating as watching fresh paint dry on the wall. There is not one track in this project that can be regarded as outstanding or a \\"must listen\\".  To top it off, the sound quality is overmodulated and distorted.  Extremely disatisfied and disappointed.  For die hard Bon Jovi fans only, and I am not one of them.

Interestingly enough the American CD release has 14 songs, while the European CD has those 14 plus 'It's a Beautiful Day, ' Be My Baby' and 'My Melancholy Baby'.  Of course, the European version is twice the price of the American CD.  Something is definitely different abroad!

B007IXWKUK|3.0|I originally had no intention of reading these books, but I did.  They aren't horrible, but the hype was waaayy overblown.  Much ado about not much.<br /><br />This is basically a Harlequin romance novel divided into 3 books.  Quite frankly, the author could have done the story in one if some of the sex scenes were removed.  And honestly, the S&M, bondage stuff is more like bondage light.  It just isn't that kinky (if that's what you were expecting).  With this second book, I started skimming the sex stuff.  It really does get repetitive after awhile.<br /><br />This series is nothing new or earth shattering or mind-blowing.  It's a decent read for what it is, but if you know someone who has the books....just borrow them.

B001WCN23W|4.0|When I first saw this album @ the local record shops, I used to be rather fascinated w/ this album's unique song titles. The songs \\"Sway\\", \\"Dead Flowers\\", \\"Sister Morphine\\", \\"Bitch\\" (Which I discovered I already heard before) & finally, \\"I Got The Blues\\" aroused my curiosity, enough to buy it in April 1975 & afterwards, I played it to death. The album was approx 4 years old in '75 & it was the FIRST record on their NEW, Rolling Stone Records... their OWN record label.  On to the songs so I can review them now.<br /><br />1.  \\"Brown Sugar\\"...This tune was on the TOP 40 hit, reaching the #1 spot in 1971.  I've always liked this hit single very much, w/ it's great music & it's real catchy beat.<br /><br />2.  \\"Sway\\"...I was kind of disappointed w/ this song. However, I do like that ONE sentence \\"It's Just That Demon Life Has Got Me In It's SWAY\\".  Otherwise, this is probably the LOUDEST song, on this album MUSICALLY & sometimes Mick Jagger's vocal is kind of hard to understand on THIS song. \\"Sway\\" is a cool title\\" (as I mentioned ABOVE).  Other than that, it is an OKAY song & strings are real NICE, actually pretty, as the song is ending. I DON'T hate this song, whatsoever, but in MY opinion, it doesn't compare to SOME of the album's BETTER tunes.<br /><br />3.  \\"Wild Horses\\"...This was also another TOP 40 hit, stalling @ #28 in 1971. I've always loved this tune & I always thought that this hit single was great w/ it's countrified feel to it. In the 2009-2010 time frame there was a dance remake of \\"Wild Horses\\" & I love THAT version, too.<br /><br />4.  \\"Can't You Hear Me Knocking\\"...I've heard this song on the radio before, but it wasn't a top 40 hit single. The first half of this song is VOCAL & the 2nd half is an instrumental to END the song. This is the album's LONGEST cut & I do think it's pretty good.<br /><br />5.  \\"You Gotta Move\\"...This is the WORST song on this entire album.  It even makes the song \\"Sway\\" sound like a MUCH BETTER song, in my honest opinion.  This is definitely my LEAST favorite song incl., here. And I thank God, it's the SHORTEST cut, too.<br /><br />6.  \\"Bitch\\"...Another hit single that wasn't on the TOP 40, either. I always remembered this song, but I didn't KNOW IT by the title, up until I bought the \\"Sticky Fingers\\" record.  I've always loved this song a lot w/ it's good music & a real catchy beat.<br /><br />7.  \\"I Got The Blues\\"...This is the VERY SLOWEST song on this album, tempo wise.  I like this one a lot. This has a nice rhythm & blues feel to it, which I do enjoy.<br /><br />8.  \\"Sister Morphine\\"...Even though I don't do (& never did) STREET drugs or HARD drugs, whatsoever, this song is as Drug Related as you can get. This song could sometimes have a really depressing feel to it. Just by listening to these words, the weird music & the vomiting...you can really feel as though you are going through THIS experience. But the funny thing is that I still like this song, anyway. And sometimes it seems to give me the chills when I listen to it.<br /><br />9.  \\"Dead Flowers\\"...Just like the songs \\"Brown Sugar\\" & \\"Bitch\\", I really love this catchy beat. And I also love the countrified music & sometimes comical lyrics.<br /><br />10. \\"Moonlight Mile\\"...This song is nice, but unfortunately it seems to have a real haunting & rather sad & actually depressing feel to it. Since this the very LAST song, on this album, I sometimes cut it off right after \\"Dead Flowers\\" ends.<br /><br />So here is my rating of this 1971 classic album.  The TITLE \\"Sticky Fingers\\" always sounded so interesting.  It's a shame that The Stones never WROTE & PERFORMED a SONG called \\"Sticky Fingers\\", it could have been a DECENT song, I think. And by the way, this album is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Years Ago, when bought my record, I kept the \\"RED TONGUE STICKER\\" that used to be on the RECORD CELLOPHANE wrapper.  The RED TONGUE used to have ALL the song titles WRITTEN on it...I always thought that was so cool.
B0039208JE|5.0|Besides the new Batman movie featuring Christian Bale ( rise of the Dark Knight was OK ), this is the only other batman move that is not animated that I would recommend. It is purely dark for the time and defiantly has Tim Burton's mark on it.

B0000524CY|5.0|These movies form the 1970's are still the creepiest things I've ever seen. I think it is because they are based so much in the real world with out all the special effects that it seems to hit &#34;home&#34; more then movies of today. The original Chain Saw Massacre resonates in the same way.

1594204217|4.0|I think I've read every one of Pollan's books.  I loved some, especially Omnivore's Dilemma, while others were just good (In Defense of Food).  With Cooked, there were parts I loved, while other parts I was ready to skim over.  In the end, I enjoyed the book immensely, but not as much as some of this others.<br /><br />Like many of his other books, Pollan divides Cooked into thematic sections (Here: Fire [Grilling], Water [Cooking in water], Air [baking], and Earth[fermenting/pickling]) but they seemed a little forced, as Pollan himself seems to acknowledge. You need fire for three of the four, and yeast plays a pretty big role in both beer and bread.  I get what he was trying to do, but it felt like it didn't quite work to enhance the themes of the book rather than merely provide breaking points.<br /><br />His introduction sets the stage for the entire book.  He identifies a dilemma in modern culture: we spend less time cooking than ever but more time watching and idolizing others who cook.  Pollan explains that contemplating this dilemma triggered something in him to write this book, and I think he makes an important overarching observation: although cooking may not be the most efficient use of time, it is an alchemic process that transforms both raw foods and people.  Without cooking, humans would not be what we are today.  The modern trend to remove cooking from everyday life, therefore, is likely to have huge consequences on who we are.  As Pollan notes, our fascination with cooking reflects the deep-seated position it holds in our lives.<br /><br />The book contains long sections with meditations on what cooking is and what it means to culture, both ancient and modern, and for the most part I enjoyed them.  For example, although it is somewhat tangential to cooking, Pollan discusses the role that microbiotics play in our gut and the effect on our health.  Tying this topic into modern cooking, he raises some very interesting questions about the effect of a \\"no-microbe\\" policy on our health.  As Pollan excels at pointing out repeatedly, the food we eat today is at the long end of the combined evolution of man and food: we eat what we eat and cook food the way we do because it is necessary to our survival.  Removing certain types of food (e.g., whole grain bread, fermented vegetables) without thinking of the consequences is fraught with peril.<br /><br />The meditations are interspersed with stories about masters of cooking and Pollan's own personal experiences. In each section, Pollan seeks out the masters in each particular field to teach him about cooking.  As with his other books, Pollan always finds the philosophers within a certain field that combine their expertise with an ability to discuss their field in a way that opens your eyes.  Who knew that bread baking would be so complex and more of an art form than simple mixing?  Pollan is a masterful storyteller, combining an ability to explain complex issues with a sharp sense of humor and self-deprecation.<br /><br />With Omnivore's Dilemma, Pollan changed how I think about the world.  For me, Cooked was different in that rather than changing how I see the world of food, he reinforced ideas I already have and gave voice to some subconscious thoughts I had about the importance of cooking my own food.  Although I have always enjoyed cooking, Pollan helps highlight WHY cooking is so enjoyable and so worthwhile.  I especially enjoyed his section on brewing beer and have been inspired to try to brew my own batch.  As he notes in his afterword, many of these endeavors seem at first glance to be an incredible waste of time and totally inefficient.  As Pollan explains, however, there is a \\"satisfaction that comes from temporarily breaking free of one's accustomed role as the producer of one thing -- whatever it is we sell into the market for a living -- and the passive consumer of everything else.\\"  Over the course of the book, Pollan successfully proves that cooking is special and shouldn't be given up so easily, and there are benefits to slowing down and becoming immersed in something so basic as the food we eat.  So while I can't claim that Cooked is as eye-opening as some of Pollan's other works, I enjoyed it immensely.al and shouldn't be given up so easily, and there are benefits to slowing down and becoming immersed in something so basic as the food we eat.

1595826971|4.0|What a great art book for reference of creepy things in this world. Beautiful pages and wonderful to look at.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Sanderson never disappoints. This little book is the reason he is one of my favorite authors around, regardless of genre. The new magic system is very interesting. I'd love to explore this word in a series.
B003OPUZYY|5.0|WOW!!! You get 5 excellent CD's(remastered) although the first CD of SSSH, you might have to turn up a couple of notches, not as great sounding as the rest of LP's. From the Chrysalis years these LP's are their 4th through 8th.Not one bad track in the entire lot. Though would of been great if they could've added &#34;Going Home&#34; as an extra, but I'm not complaining just saying. There's a couple of singles added in along with some live tracks thrown as extras. If your not familiar with TYA and just know them through Woodstocks &#34;Going Home&#34;, Alvin Lee is one of the most overlooked guitarists of his time, you'll get some rockers, excellent blues tracks and some fine guitar picking. Bought this for &#34;A space in time&#34; remastered, but was blown away by the other good music on here. You won't be dissapointed unless you thing &#34;Going Home&#34; like sounds is what your looking for.
B0034G4OVS|5.0|Wow, I heard about this movie and finally watched it a long time ago. I have been looking for it for quite some time now and no luck. I decided to search Amazon and there it was.....A great, sit on the edge of your seat movie.
1932100660|5.0|I got the book in 2 days from ordering it and it lives up to the reputation. We live a healthy life style so we are not zombies we take information is and think for our selves. This book has some very good information.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|devious down loading the app.then would not let me register until I shut my Samsung IIIs off and restarted. Works well otherwise.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book was light hearted, fun, and extremely steamy. If you are looking for a read that will make you unable to put the book sham then this is your lucky day!!!
B00004RJ71|5.0|Searched Amazon and there it was. This is one of my old time favorites.......Thank you!!!!!! I also received it much faster than I thought.....
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game is so much fun so worth its money you really sure get the is app the game is nice not too long but long enough that you won't get bored
1905236042|5.0|This is a great way to spend some quality time together and destress at the same time.  My kids love to be active and sometimes it is hard to calm down our youngest one when she is having fun.  We use this as a tool to get into a state of mind to begin winding down for the day.  It is great to use right before bed and it is also a great wake up on weekends.  The kids get a lot of use out of it and I'm learning to enjoy Yoga more than ever.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I liked your book it made me cry cause I couldn't get to 100% page and I ran to me room and became a fatty thanks for making me realise  who I really am! ;)
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I think it was fascinating. The characters and story line are very interesting. I can't wait to see Season 3.
B00AIJP9BS|1.0|at first I was like Haas fooseball! but it sucks:don't get it it ducks a lot and its impossible to play! don't get it!
B00026ZG10|5.0|NOW THIS IS AN EXCEPTIONALLY WELL DONE MOVIE.  ACTION AND TWISTS ALL THROUGH THE STORY.  HERE'S ARNOLD MARRIED AND AN UNDERCOVER SPY.  WIFIE HAS NO CLUE AS TO WHAT HE REALLY IS, AND IS BORED STIFF WITH HER HOUSEWIFE CAREER.  FUNNY SCENES ENSUE WHEN SHE IS APPROACHED TO &#34;ACT&#34; AS A SPY.  ALLALULIA!  LIFE PICKS UP AT A PACE SHE IS QUITE UNPREPARED FOR.  BUY THIS MOVIE, GRAB SOME MUNCHIES,  A GLASS OF WINE, KICK OFF YOUR FOOTGEAR AND BE PREPARED TO BE ENTERTAINED BY THIS TWO-SOME WHO COMPLIMENT EACH OTHER.  ONE OF THE BEST SCENES IS AT THE END, WHERE THEY BOTH ENGAGE IN A REALLY GREAT TANGO!  ALL MARRIAGES SHOULD GO THROUGH THIS CRISIS ONCE IN A WHILE.  THERE'D BE LESS DIVORCES, THAT'S FOR SURE.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|Interesting 300+ Harvard business case in a novel. Exaggerated sometimes but close to reality in most cases.<br />Great reading not only for Ops IT also for Development.
044042321X|4.0|I won't lie, but I had a hard time trying to read and follow the book and its story line.  I never finished it, but the graphics are nice.
B003Y5H4SY|4.0|SUSPENSEFUL AND CHILLING.  GOOD MOVIE FOR THOSE WHO LIKE TO BE SCARED.  AND OH YEAH, USE THE STAIRS; AVOID ELEVATORS!
B0076DELIG|4.0|And, that is why...if you read this book...you'll read another, and another, and...<br /><br />Trust me.  Been there; done that.  And, you will do it too.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The Hunger Games trilogy is a good read for any and everyone.  I recommend it for kids and adults alike.  This digital Kindle book is a great format to take along with you and read on your tablet.  The price is even better for a fraction of the printed editions.<br />We all know the first book from the movies, so I'm not going to describe or retell the plot line.  With the second movie about to be released, this series will undoubtedly become even more popular.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|IT'S ALL HERE, FOLKS.  GRAB A SALAMI SANDWICH, SOME PICKLES, AND A BOTTLE OF WATER; SIT BACK AND ENJOY THIS CRAZY (AS A FOX) DETECTIVE WHO FOOLED THE BEST OF THE CROOKS AND MURDERERS THAT RAN AMUCK THROUGHOUT THIS SERIES.  HE ALWAYS ZEROED IN ON THE SUSPECT, DROVE HE/SHE NUTS, AND FINALLY ROUNDED UP THE VILLIAN THROUGH HIS FLAWLESS DEDUCTIONS AS TO &#34;WHO DONE IT&#34;!  GREAT ENTERTAINMENT, GREAT ENTERTAINER.  SORRY HE ISN'T WITH US TODAY.
B0035XVVDY|4.0|While Jamie Foxx is the headliner of the film, I think that Gerard Butler steals the show.  It is hard to speak definitively about the roles of these two characters without spoiling the plot.  Suffice it to say that the film displays some of the major limitations of our justice system, and provides an engaging story of a frustrated victim who takes matters into his own hands.  Butler's<br />character witnesses his wife and daughter brutally murdered, and seeks justice.<br /><br />A few scenes are really graphic with their calculated violence.  These scenes are integral to the plot, not just gratuitous extras.  But, if you are faint of heart you should consider giving this film a pass.<br /><br />Complex plot leaves you wondering how things are happening.  By the end of the film all is revealed.
B0001ARCFA|4.0|Okay, I'm a little bias for AKG.  I already have the AKG Q701, which I use daily and for hours at a time.  The sound is good, but not as good as the Q701, but then I wouldn't expect it to.  These are semi-open, so it's not going to completely block the outside noise, or keep your music from leaking.  The bass is shy and the highs rather harsh, but its still a good entry level headphone for less than $100.
B000MD9UJC|3.0|It does not allow you to use the focus too spot-light you are locked into flood but it is much brighter
B000E0LB7C|4.0|Backhaus'earlier (and in my view better)recording of the complete sonatas is now available from Pristine.  It is in good sounding mono and also, I believe, in ambient stereo remastering created by Pristine.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|Well worth seeing at least one time, not exactly my regular flavor of movies.<br />The family has read all the books so they hope there will be more movies based on this series.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am hooked! Love it, can't get enough , want to own the whole series!  I don't appreciate having to have a word requirement for a rating though!
B00957T6X6|5.0|The series starts small, two families, then grows and grows to encompass an entire world.  My sympathies are with the Starks, they endure such tragedy, trying to do the right thing. Outside the Starks, there is Tyrion Lannister and Daenarys Targaryen who I very much enjoyed following along.  And Irri and Jhiqui with, \\"It is known. It is known.\\"  Ygritte with \\"You know nothing, Jon Snow.\\" A terrific and engrossing read.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I gave this a 5 star was well shipped and packed well ty .well pleased shes a great singer! love her music!
B003DZX3SA|1.0|While I realize I bought this used, this was beyond acceptable. The disc stopped playing about a third of the way through and would not play for the rest of the movie. If a DVD is that badly damaged, it should not be re-sold at all.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This book is about more than war. It's about life, leadership, faith, and strength. An amazing read that left me inspired!
0802473156|5.0|I love this book! Really good read. It's directed to married couples, but I think it can be applied to unmarried couples and even singles! It's amazing how many different ways we give love and receive it. This book helps to decode how your loved ones give and receive love.
B00BEZTMWW|4.0|We liked it :)  It wasn't quite what my husband (who has read the book) was expecting however, it was good and funny at times.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|This game has multiple endings. You won't finish this game once, and not feel influenced to try it again to get a different outcome. I'm definitely glad I played this. What I like most about the game is how it's uncensored, the language the characters use is appropriate given the situation they're in, and it really sucks you in and puts you in their position.
B007PVHANM|5.0|As a Marley super fan, I expected to watch this and not find out much I didn't already know. But this was great. Very informing. Gave a great look into the life of Bob Marley, who he was and how he became to be the Great Bob Marley!
B00171EO0I|5.0|did you say Gerard butler?!?<br />sexy voice Irish life<br />what can go wrong?<br />a must for any female. heck my hubby even likes
B00936A0RU|5.0|I absolutely love this movie! My grandparents were from Virginia & growing up, I heard stories about moonshiners. This movie brought those stories to life for me. Tom Hardy & Guy Pearce gave great performances as did the entire cast! I highly recommend the movie!
B00BUCW54Q|5.0|This movie is a great action flick.  Not to over the top or unbelievable.  I thought Cruise as always delivers well.  Great plot and great hand to hand action.  Definitely would recommend.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I got the book originally because of Tesla. After starting to read, I realised it was written at a completely different angle than any other. Great read.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|A good source of entertainment however I have yet to actually play the 2nd chance round on my fire. Not sure if the cause of the glitch  but it is still a fun game.
B003XRELGQ|5.0|Great book. Thats all thats needs to be said.  Vonnegut has a style like non other. His books are food for thought.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Nice game to kill some time. If you like Mahjong, it is a good game. Not exciting, but it does present a challenge.
B00BEPVAV8|3.0|In this game you will start loving it, but once you create a person it will delete all of your memory and start you completely over!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very fun to play, sometimes additive. Love it! I really recommend this one. I actually recommended this to a lot of my friends and they love the app... So far so good. :)
