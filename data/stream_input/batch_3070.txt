B00BD99JMW|2.0|I absolutely loved the first two books of this trilogy, but the third book was a big let-down. I felt like character development was lacking. The relationship between Tris and Tobias was practically non-existent in this book - good or bad. The end of the book was anti-climactic after the build-up of the previous books. Very disapponting.
B00FJTYDKK|4.0|Cute movie.  I didn't think I would like the move as much as I did.  It was very funny. The whole family enjoyed it.
B006BAEQB2|4.0|It was good, not her best, but I didn't like the main character much, so that would taint my opinion I suppose.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Love this movie--again another princess who doesn't have be reliant on a man to save her.  Great lessons, great animation.  The whole turning Mom into a bear thing was a bit scary for my 3 year old, but after the first viewing, she's become a fan of the movie as well.  I will say that Merida herself holds no &#34;princess&#34; appeal for my daugther, but I'm on board with that.  We really don't need to add any more princesses to the mix at this point!

B00A8MGIZG|5.0|I do understand why CLOUD ATLAS was not a blockbuster.  At over 170 minutes, it's a long movie to sit through.  And the movie is a tapestry of six story threads, all taking place in different locales, and in different historical eras.  The thread \\"Sloosha's Crossin' an' Ev'rythin' After\\", taking place in a post-apocalyptic world in the year 2321, is particularly difficult to follow, as the story suggests English as we know it has been altered to an almost unrecognizable dialect.  Next in difficulty is the story \\"An Orison of Somni~451\\", taking place in a futuristic Seoul where a food-serving clone becomes the focal point of a revolution.  Based on the above, I understand why CLOUD ATLAS never found a huge audience.  I had to view this film three times to get an adequate feel for it, and now I am a total fan; once the extended DVD with its special features is released (and I'm hoping this will be the case), I will be adding CLOUD ATLAS to my DVD collection.<br /><br />Extolling the theme that over time our lives are a mosaic that intertwine and affect other lives, CLOUD ATLAS is a moving, haunting film focused on the obscure musical composition 'Cloud Atlas Sextet'.  Including the two stories referenced above, other threads include a shipping voyage in the South Pacific in 1849; a dysfunctional musical collaboration in 1936; exposing corrupt big oil in 1973; and a delightful romp in (and from) a senior center in the UK in 2012.  Most of the cast appear in all, or some, of the separate threads, as different characters (obviously).  And what a cast:  Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent (the lead in \\"The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish\\", by far my favorite story), Hugo Weaving, Doona Bae, Susan Sarandon, and Hugh Grant, to name but a few.  You're guaranteed to get a kick out of Tom Hanks playing thuggish indie author Dermot Hoggins in the \\"Cavendish\\" thread, where he gets the ultimate revenge over a most disagreeable literary critic.  And throughout the six threads, the haunting musical score by Reinhold Heil, Johnny Klimek, and Tom Tyker only enhances the surreal film-viewing experience.  All six stories overlap to some extent--share a metaphysical commonality--making CLOUD ATLAS come together full circle.  No, this film is not for everyone; I'm just delighted it so appeals to me.<br />--D.

B001BANK32|5.0|Normally I don't read Stephen King or much horror in general, but this book really caught my attention, an after all it's almost Halloween. I really enjoyed it and thought it was surprisingly well written as well as fun to read. Scary but also suspenseful and with characters who keep you on the edge of your seat wanting more. I understand now why King decided to write a sequel. You really do want to know what happened to Danny years later.
0312330537|2.0|Grabbed me early with the utterly realistic picture of a fugitive moving through the various communities of Mumbai in the 1980s, but began to lose me partway through when it became a little too over-dramatic and unbelievable.  The longer I think about the book the worse it gets – too many plot holes, story lines left hanging, unnecessary characters that were never developed, moral quandaries never reflected upon, etc.  Still, I loved his beautiful insight into so many aspect of Indian culture, especially parts left unexplored by other more one-dimensional Indian-set novels.  I wonder if it could have been a better book if the author had made harder choices and his editors had been much more aggressive.<br /><br />Good points: Usually entertaining, unpredictable, great cultural insight.<br /><br />Bad points: Way too much description, too many missed attempts at striking metaphors (he hits maybe one in four tries), too many undeveloped characters, some quack philosophy, and over-the-top even for India.<br /><br />Big question: Why is it called Shantaram?  There's a huge disconnect between the author being briefly nicknamed this “Man of Peace” by a fringe character, and his conduct as a gangster in the entire rest of the book.

B008JFUNKU|5.0|Whatever anyone tells you about the greatness of this film, believe them. This is just about as good as it gets.<br /><br />Here's the scoop. Captain Phillips (Tom Hanks) is on his way to Northern Africa to captain a Maersk cargo ship through a familiar route. During the trip they are set upon by pirates and the ensuing drama will wrap its hands around your throat and won't let go.<br /><br />Paul Greengrass has a strong history as a director and there seems to be no stopping him. This is some powerful stuff. And he had a strong script to work with. First off: The bad guys here aren't \\"bad guys.\\" These are poor North Africans being hired for a ruthless task by others unseen. You get the impression that whatever money they make is nothing compared to what those who hired them are making. They just want to get through this but they're in over their heads. Then there's Phillips. Hanks is a seasoned professional and it shows here. One of his final scenes is so powerful it, alone, is worth the price of admission. He's a by the books guy. He's not overly strict with his men but he's not their buddy either. He expects them to do as he asks. He's also clever. He pulls a couple of tricks that help him and his men in this difficult situation. Then there's Greengrass. This is no slick Hollywood outing. There is a lot of hand held camera and natural light which helps draw the viewer into the action. You feel as though you are there with them. And it's not overwrought. That grip on your throat tightens and loosens regularly, allowing you to catch your breath.<br /><br />There are a couple of minor quibbles I could raise but they'd be nothing compared to the overall greatness of this flick.
B000I3SYEI|5.0|This is the best movie ever created.  Anyone who gives it a less than 5 star obviously has no taste.  Great acting, great plot, great period.
B00DYZ2YVG|2.0|Conversation started October 16<br />Luke Green<br />10/16, 9:26am<br />Luke Green<br /><br />Undead Valleys has some points of interest. The degeneration of infected berserkers into more traditional shambling zombies is not something I've seen done before. The plot framework is solid with events proceeding in a logical fashion. There are a few clever bits here and there and the author has incorporated much of his own life into the tale and it is clear that he is discussing things which are important to him.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the strong points of the book are buried under a vast need for editing. There are missing commas, run-on sentences, typos, missing words and mistaken words all throughout the book. I expect such mistakes. I find them all the time in professionally edited, traditionally printed material. However, in most of the books I've read these mistakes are occasional and can usually be counted on one hand. The mistakes in this book are pervasive. Every page is filled with grammar errors and each one is draining away the emotion that the author seeks to convey.<br /><br />Unity is also an issue in the book. There are several places where the topic changes within a paragraph, forcing the reader to slow down and spend extra time processing what was said and work out which fragments belonged to which topic. There are points where the dialogue of two separate characters occurs within the same paragraph. This makes it rather difficult to parse out who is talking to whom at any given moment.<br /><br />The lack of unity combined with the numerous grammar errors makes for a distinct lack of coherence. When I say that, I am talking about literary or linguistic coherence: the element which causes a written work to hold together. Despite the fact that the events of the story and each of the details within those events are easy to identify, the story itself is rather a bit of a ramble.<br /><br />Research is another area lacking. The author seems to have donelittle to no research in the way genetics and biology work. This wouldn't be so terrible if he had taken the normal dodge of being rather vague about the particulars of the contagion and the cure. Even this might probably have been a non-issue if the grammar and unity of the book were stronger. As it was, I had to read it analytically rather than for pleasure and the science mistakes were fairly obvious. Again, however, a good book can survive science mistakes. For that matter, good books sometimes deliberately ignore science even in a story that is considered a more mainstream genre. The grammar errors discussed above, however, make these mistakes more obvious than they should be.<br /><br />The final one is believability. While an apocalypse situation can believably result in a civilian leading military forces, a plot development which has been successfully done several times before, the development is not carried out well here. In the main character's first mission, he is given the lead despite his reputation for being a drunk due simply to the fact that he's a local. Add to that, he, as a civilian with limited prior experience, lectures the military personnel under him, who have combat experience against the zombies, about the best way to deal with zombies based on what he had read in the paper. This is probably the most damning mistake on this line, since it is behavior that lacks textual support and thus undermines the rather more acceptable path of development as it comes later on. The next major mistake is in giving the character a rank later on. Corporal especially was a poor choice as that's a rather low rank and not one that would be put in command of anything.<br /><br />The language of the book in general sounds primarily American in nature and I had to check to see that the author did, indeed, live in Wales. Most of the characters have bland sort of Standard American English way of speech, the kind no one really speaks outside of news broadcasts. Thatspeech is peppered with the occasional slang to give them a semblance of an accent, however, most of the slang is rather more American than British. As such the implied accent is more American than British or Welsh. The one character who has strong English elements to their speech, General Lazenby, strikes me as more of a caricature of the English dialect than an actual example of it. There is the possibility however, the impression of an American accent is one coming from me, since I am an American. In which case, the language is so bland and non-specific that I'm simply imprinting my own accent on it.<br /><br />This brings us to the character of Rico, who sprinkles Spanish throughout his speech in a manner common to Mexican-Americans. This would be less of a problem if the character were Mexican-American, but he's British born and raised. He should sound British and if he was using terms like &#34;ese&#34; or &#34;loco&#34; or the like, then it would likely sound artificial and fake. This is made worse by dialogue coming from him discussing his culture. The first instance was eye-catching and not in a good way. Catholicism is not unknown in Britain, and the prohibition against suicide would be equally well known. Rico shouldn't have to comment that his culture specifically looks down on it. A sign of the cross would have been good enough, actually.<br /><br />The &#34;ethnic superstitions&#34; line is simply debasing. We don't call our own culture prohibitions against the number 13, black cats, breaking mirrors and other such things &#34;ethnic superstitions.&#34; Why would a Hispanic refer to his own culture's quirks as &#34;ethnic superstitions?&#34; The author could just as easily remove the word &#34;ethnic&#34; and it would be fine. &#34;Superstition&#34; and &#34;ethnic&#34; are both loaded words. Superstition implies a primitive understanding of things and a degree of ignorance. Ethnic scientifically denotes as something related to ethnicity, but it con-notates as being related to a minority population. Pairing ethnic with superstition causes it to lean toward the improper connotative meaning rather than the more scientific usage of the word. Spoken by a member of the ethnic group being referred to, it comes across as a tacit admission of inferiority and primitive nature.<br /><br />That's the summary. For the most part, the story breaks down on mechanics and conventions rather than plot, however, there are notable flaws in pacing, plot and character development that grow out of those break downs. As a whole, I can't give this story more than two stars as it currently stands. I do hope that the author can find the time to have the story placed in the hands of an editor and get some help correcting these flaws. If he manages so, this could be a decently interesting story.

B000AJIF4E|1.0|10/29/2013, brought from 6ave through amazon.<br />Just brought this headphones and find my Klipsch earphones sounded better.<br />The headphones has Virtually no bass, mid-range and high are so so even comparing with my earphone. (the earphone was $15, nothing fancy.) I was looking for an upgrade from my Sennheiser 202. I'm thinking about returning it.<br />In addition, I suspect that most of the positive comments and those aggressively defensive comments are coming from folks who brought theirs years ago.<br /><br />10/30/2013 Update: To be fair, the sound stage is deeper and more complete comparing to my earphones. Still, I am going to return the Sony 7506 headphones for the following 3 reasons: First, not worth the price for me.  (It might worth the price for those who brought it before, but I recommend they try the new one and then offer their thoughts.)  Second, I can't bear the heat building up around my ear. I don't think I can wear the headphones for more than 2 hours.  Third, the build is really flimsy and feel really cheap.  Oh well, that's just my 2 cents and I'm sure there are experts out there would disagree.<br /><br />10/30/2013 After I've done some tests on the headphones (I really tried to like them so I don't have to look further), I found one side of the headphones is not responding well on certain hi frequencies so the sound stage are not centered(driver matching test).  I don't know if that means the headphones I got is defective but given the warranty is only 90 days, I think I'm going to get something else with longer warranty.

B00A8MGLAI|5.0|I love Tom Hanks movies, He is the Spencer Tracy of my generation. The perfect actor to pull of the acting onslaught that this movie represents. This movie could be 6 movies and still be great. A strong case in how everything affects everything else. You have to see this movie several times to truly absorb everything it shows. This movie makes me feel like a kid again hearing stories around the fire.

You really feel like you're there! For me it's the show i've been waiting for! I strongly recommend it! If you're a Lepp you'll ADORE it! If you're not...you'll turn into one! The band is at an excellent prime, they surely deliver an outstanding spectacle! Both the Hysteria part and the awesome Ded Flatbird (great songs and some laughs...)will grab you onto your seat, and have you want to repeat the dose!100% ??? Hell no!!! 1000%...!

B00F30S0Y0|5.0|Arcade Fire is one of my favorite bands; in fact, they are the only band making music today that I care about (other than Springsteen), and I thank my friend who introduced me to them.<br /><br />So I was really excited when I first heard they were releasing a new album.<br /><br />I didn't really like Reflektor on the first two listens, but something about it haunted my dreams, and by the third and fourth listens, I loved it.<br /><br />I cannot even describe how it has made me feel this past week.<br /><br />For me at least, one of the reasons for (listening to) music is to make you feel happy for being alive or make you realize you are not alone, even if life kinda still sucks.<br /><br />This is what this record has done for me. I am almost embarrassed to be gushing so, but it's been a long time since a piece of art has affected me as much.<br /><br />It's really hard to discern my favorite songs, but Afterlife is the one that's on my mind today.<br /><br />Reflektor is one of those albums that you really just have to sit down and listen to all the way through with a glass of wine or a glass of whiskey, by yourself or with your loved one as they sleep in the other room, gratitude washing over you, and hoping that maybe she wakes up to dance, or if she doesn't, that she is having beautiful dreams.
B004HW7JMY|5.0|The history nut in me loves that someone actually did research. They even used names of actual Gladiators. The was a Gannicus, there once was a Crixes. Well cast, well written, action, story, well paced. I could watch everyday and still want to watch it.

B00G4ZPE6A|5.0|This is a great album.<br /><br />However, potential buyers may want to know that these sellers are buying these specific 'ZinePak releases from Wal-Mart (available to anyone for $16.88 as of a few minutes ago) and offering them here for the prices shown. Which is not a crime; you'll have to decide what you think about that practice, and about the seller engaging in the practice.<br /><br />The seller's &#34;Editorial Review&#34; is a verbatim copy-paste from the Wal-Mart page's &#34;About the Item&#34; section. That probably *is* a crime: the copied material is essentially the entirety of the Wal-Mart page's descriptive text, the Wal-Mart page is clearly marked &#34;© 2013 Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.&#34;, and there's nothing on this page acknowledging the source, much less indicating that it was copied with permission. Amazon should evaluate their policy on publishing copyrighted material without the copyright holder's permission.<br /><br />How do we know that these are from Wal-Mart? Because the text that the seller *didn't* plagiarize from their page is the part about<br /><br />  &#34;The PRISM 'ZinePak is only sold at Walmart and Walmart.com and available while supplies last.&#34;<br /><br />Obviously, at some point Wal-Mart is going to sell out of this Wal-Mart exclusive product, and it will only be available from resellers. Who will probably charge a premium for an item that will at that time be out of print. At that point, this review will no longer be accurate, and will be eligible for review or removal. I'm fine with that action; reviews--especially ones like this--should only be around as long as they add value.

B00E7RZEI0|3.0|I little too difficult for toddlers, but the graphics are nice. My grand daughter loves to push the water button.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I think that authors sometimes forget that although they conceive and write the book, it is in the reader's imagination that the story is fleshed out. While I enjoyed the first two books of this series I was left saddened by the finale.
B00CTSDDVO|4.0|Being a total Sci fi Junkie I appreciate what JJ Abrams brings to the screen. It's obvious he has studied the origins of this series and has subtly added parts of the original series and yet at the same time twisted and tweaked them to make them his own. So I say Interesting because I like seeing old familiar characters through a new visionary. I hope the next one is better. Not to say this one wasn't good because it was. Money well spent.
B006ATJXQW|4.0|Very well written book, no major climax, it is not a waste of money, the epilogue was sad, hoped for this book to be like The Maze Runner Death Cure a and Scorch Trials but I had too high expectations
B005HF0BIE|4.0|Wow , I was impressed with the story line and history again. I love the clothing and make up in the series, they are very detailed. The only reason I did not give them five stars is because it's not so graphic as I would like things to be. Yes , I'm a little bit like that.

B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Solid performance, low power and heat profile.  Bought this as a cheaper alternative for my son's box and its performing almost as well as my i7 which sort of surprised me.  As far as gaming goes, the stock heat sink works fine and I can't say how much I'm impressed with its performance.  If you're looking for something a little cheaper to an i7, look no further.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|The story is solid, though as a comic fanatic I was disappointed at how some the characters were minimized, clearly if I didn't know the Mandarin i would have enjoyed the movie. Regardless Robert Downey Jr. is Tony Stark as Errol Flynn was Robin Hood. The movie is good paced. Kudos to the writing staff they are firing on all cylinders. Special effects were spot on. This is a movie I can watch again and again.
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|I cannot quit this game. Very easy to pick up when you have 2 mins or 2 hours to kill.

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I like his books. Lots of twists and turn.  Hard to stop reading it. You really get to know the characters.
1476727651|5.0|A Stephen King fan, I always enjoy his work.  The movie of his book THE SHINING was one of the scariest I've ever seen, and when I learned King had written a sequel to the book, I had to read it.  It does not disappoint.  His exploration of psychic powers is unparalleled.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Riveting.  I have watched from season one and absolutely love the story line(s)!!!  I also love watching on my Kindle -- UP close and personal!
B00BEEKN26|5.0|I heard about this from a co-worker who only raves or recommends the best.  I'd missed the first three episodes and was relieved that it was available on On-Demand.  Incredible!  So many hints, mis-clues, possible suspects and leads.  And the end... caught me blindsided.  Brilliant writing, acting, directions, the whole nine yards.  You have to pay attention and I'd rewind at least three times a show to wonder if I'd heard or seen something important.  And now, I want to see the whole thing again.<br /><br />Please, please, get this out in USA format!  I'll be the first in line!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|For some reason I was set against reading \\"divergent\\"! After weeks of my cousin bugging me I finally downloaded it.. I finished divergent and insurgent in 3 days then waited till 12 am to download \\"allegiant \\" as soon as I could... All I hear is fans complaining about the ending but if you ask me it's about time everyone doesn't skip off into the sunset! Way over due! I loved the characters the storyline everything! The things that go on in each of the books really makes you feel like you can connect since the things that go on r things that happen in real life everyday. For those of you who believe in happily ever after and skipping through fields of flowers more power to you but for those of you who live in the real world where tragic things happen yet you still manage to pick yourself up keep moving and use the experience to better yourself then this is the book for you!<br /><br />Happy Reading

006202406X|1.0|I was so excited for this book and pre-ordered to make sure I had my copy in hand the day it came out. I was captivated by the first book, and though the second was not quite as good, it was still a satisfying read and continuation of the story. This book, however, is a complete let down. As others have mentioned, the alternating POV completely failed in this book. Though chapters were titled 'Tobias,' it would only take a few paragraphs of reading to forget who was talking. The whole book sounded like Tris regardless of who's POV it was supposed to be. I felt like Tobias was a completely different person in this book and it only took a chapter or two of reading his POV that I decided I liked him better when I didn't know what he was thinking. His character becomes a watered-down version of himself in this book. The love story between them for the first part of the book felt forced, Tris is oblivious of him and what he's dealing with one minute, then forcing him into a corner to make out with him the next. I just wasn't buying it. Character development seems to have fallen by the wayside in this book in favor of trying to tie up a million loose ends left from the previous two books. So much new information is presented in this book that the characters took a hit, and it didn't pay off. As for the ending.....pointless and ruins the whole series for me. I understand Tris struggled with what it meant to truly by selfless, and wondered could she be truly selfless, but for me she already had moments that proved previously in the story. On more than one occasion she acted in a way that was selfless and often did it thinking she would die as a result. Just because she came out of those situations alive doesn't mean that she didn't truly fulfill that act of selflessness or understand what it meant. Also, her struggle in making her decision at the end wasn't hers to struggle with, it was Caleb's. If anything, Tris's bigger problem is butting out of other's business and realizing that everyone else has their demons to deal with and it doesn't always have to involve her doing it for them. The explanation for Divergence doesn't fully pan out when looking at all the characters and neither does the reason for Chicago being sealed off from the rest of the world. Scientifically, wouldn't you want everyone together to dilute those damaged genes rather than throw everyone together and wait for things to evolve themselves(which in the real world takes more than just 7 generations of inbreeding damaged genes...). This book was a classic case of the author biting off more than they could chew and ruined a great story trying to explain everything. I won't be seeing the movies(I'd be surprised if they made all 3), and I won't purchase any further released material regarding this storyline or characters. This book completely killed the whole series for me. If I could get my money back, I would. I've read that the author doesn't owe readers a certain ending or anything for that matter, it's their story to tell. Well, let me tell you, if writing is your job, and it's meant to pay your bills, then you do owe them something. They are the ones buying your books and allow you to continue to get your stuff published and turned into movies. If someone else performed their job poorly they would be fired, and I'm firing Mrs. Roth.
B00ARN0ZF0|3.0|Very slow.  Almost didn't make it to the end where everything happens. But the ending is not worth all the time it takes to get there.
B005LAIIN0|4.0|This is definitely not your normal zombie movie and that's a good thing.<br />There are plenty of zombie activity out there and what wasn't needed was another run of the mill movie.<br />There are zombies in the movie and plenty of them, but the focus isn't on the zombies, but on survival of those not affected.<br />The zombies are seen more as a virus than the un-dead and this works well.<br />If you expect moaning, slow walking zombies, then this movies not for you.  If you want to see a well put together story, with great special effects and not to be disappointed at the end, then watch this!
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|All very interesting but extremely detailed. Wasn't up to the challenge. I put it aside and do go back to it from time to time but I read on my breaks at work. Not relaxing at all. Not the author's fault!
B00FEHXISA|1.0|Iron Man is a comic strip character that has been hijacked to make a violent, disturbing, and very distastful movie.  The movie spends too much time on the negative characteristics of Tony Stark and even touches on suicide and leaving the world behind because that could be a better choice.  Also the un-needed violence escalates through the movie to point that my 10 and 13 walked away from the movie on their own.  The movie guys are trying to hype the movie to bring in the adult audience, but they have missed their target. Go back to how IM2 is set up with a villian and go down the comic strip road. Obviously the movie studio bean counters thought that more violence and personalized violence plus some seedy and controversial topics would bring in more dollars and Jon Favreau let them get away with it. As for the families that like the Captain America, Thor, and the Avengers movies,  Iron Man missed the mark and was a tin flop not a strong steel movie.  Unless you are ready to explain all the issues in this movie to your kids JUST STAY AWAY and go read a book.  Turn it around Jon Favreau. You are a better director and producer than this.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|This was definitely one of the better books that I have read in this genre.  The characters were real and the story line completely plausible.  A true joy to read.
B00ELOOYZI|4.0|Great app. Physics seem good and I even learned a few things about orbit!<br />Only negative is that the design interface could use some work.  It's hard to tell what is connected properly and sometimes I have to delete the whole rocket bc I can't get pieces to separate. Very lame.<br /><br />Other than that I'm having a lot of fun.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is the first book I've read by this author.  I was really impressed.  He wove a fascinating story with multiple believable characters, a tight plot with plenty of suspense, and had a superb command of evocative language.  There was sufficient believability to his imagined future to really hook this reader.  Needless to say, I will be reading a good bit more of his work.  Superb!
B008JFUQZ2|1.0|Worse movie of 2013. Only watched half of it and turned it off. Don't waste your time and money on this movie.

B002JXK5VU|5.0|It is  like seeing an old friend. The development of  the actors<br />and story line. The humor and science lingo,which I understand<br />Is based in fact,just made this series something to watch. I evenl looked forward to  the shows signature song.<br />Watch it, you will get hooked.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Roth takes her readers on a beatifully written an suspenseful story in the first two books of this series, but sadly misses the mark in this book with me. Not only was Alligent hard to follow when told from alternating POV's its ending made no sense. She had a great series but it's all been ruined for me in the last 50 pages of this book. ***SPOILERS<br />Alright having Tris die at the end made me hate the whole series and that really makes me sad because the first two books were so phenomenal. Tris has lived through far worse situations/circumstances than the one she actually dies in...for her to die because she was shot even AFTER RESISTING the death serum was just pointless for me, espically since she didn't need to die at all. I understand that not all books have happy endings were everyone lives, but I think if you going to kill off a main character 50 pages before the book ends you should have a probable reason. Another thing that upset me is the fact that we were on this emotional roller coaster with Tris and Tobias's relationship and when they so close, to being together without risking there lives everyday, and actually getting to be a couple, Tris dies. I read books to escape life and reality, by  making  the readers so emotionally involved with a characters welfare then just kill her off is cruel and unnecessary. The only reason I gave this book 2 stars instead of one is the fact that besides the ending the book wasn't aweful...defiantly the worst out if series even without the terrible ending. Bottom line this book was disappointing compared to the first two books and was a terrible conclusion to the series. Now this is just my opinion but I'm really upset that I invested all this time into reading this series and the author ends it like that. I guess all I'm saying is the first two books in this series is amazing and this one isn't so bad till the lay 50 pages, but the ending is aweful and unreasonable so if you don't like endings like that ten don't read the last 50 pages of this book! Lol no read all of them, but this one was a HUGE letdown for me :(
006202406X|3.0|2.5 stars rounded up.<br /><br />Be Aware: Whilst I do not exactly give away the ending this review could be said to contain minor spoilers. And possibly major ones if you read between the lines.<br /><br />Blurb : Told from a riveting dual perspective, Allegiant, by #1 New York Times best-selling author Veronica Roth, brings the Divergent series to a powerful conclusion while revealing the secrets of the dystopian world that has captivated millions of readers in Divergent and Insurgent.<br /><br />Yeah. But no. Sigh. Pfft. Oh where to start. Darn it, I try and build up a reputation for being able to find the positive in everything and here I am actually struggling. So again I say Pfft.<br /><br />Ok, having given myself a few minutes there are positives. I won't have to read it again. Oops thats rather an ironic positive. Lets go for a more positive positive. The quality of the writing has not diminished. Ms Roth can still put words together into sentences and make them jump off the page. Great. Thats one of the things that made Divergent and Insurgent so compelling. She's a damn good writer. Characterisation is (was?) top notch and the world is (was?) well imagined...thats why many readers have been holding their breath for the promised \\"stunning\\" conclusion of the series. Well job done. It WAS stunning. Although perhaps not in the way one might have hoped...<br /><br />For the early part I kind of enjoyed it...I disliked the dual points of view especially because I worked out fairly quickly why we were going to need such a thing, and despite my hanging on in there in the hope that I was wrong - I was not. Which in and of itself left me uninspired - a writer of the calibre of Ms Roth really should be able to surprise me. After all she has done it once or twice over the course of the first two novels.  Then shortly after Tris and Co hit the \\"outside\\" world it started to annoy me..then I started to swear at it.<br /><br />The whole \\"genetics\\" thing seemed illogical given what had gone before. It was also a terribly dull explanation considering the lead in and the inspired writing that gave us Dauntless, Erudite et al and how the ending of \\"Insurgent\\" hinted at the possibility of something unique and wonderful to come. The new characters were a bit wooden - possibly because, this being the last novel, there was nowhere really for them to go - so yes. Uninspired. Thats me.<br /><br />Now I'm back to this. Sigh. Pfft. Disappointed.<br /><br />Final thoughts.  Some people have called Ms Roth brave for the ending she gave us, others have called her cliched, others still have said she has betrayed her loyal following. Me I sit here. This is her story, her vision, her ending. So in that sense it is what it should be. For me though it felt wrong. I disliked it intensely and I'm not afraid to say so. Ms Roth has not betrayed me, she wrote her ending and its my choice to not like it.  I would agree there is some cliche, and I would also agree it was kind of brave....I also wonder if the movie trilogy (assuming they all get made) will have a different ending. I imagine it will...<br /><br />Happy Reading Folks!<br /><br />**Hardback purchased via Amazon UK **given what had gone before.

B00FRN2QZM|2.0|Truth be told I don't really care for &#34;Burials&#34;. I have enjoyed most of AFI's recorded output in the past, but I simply found &#34;Burials&#34; to be overproduced and underwritten.<br />The songs all sound massive, but they're usually not doing anything all that interesting. They've been layered with synthesizers and guitars but none of it creates any really well written melodies or interesting progressions. The mix also renders bassist Hunter Burgan and Adam Carson nonentities, which is a pity as they are a talented rhythm section.<br />Davey Havok doesn't really scream anymore, and that's all well and good. But what he's singing here isn't particularly memorable. It's the same sort of vague doom and gloom that has wide appeal because it's not really saying anything.<br />&#34;Burials&#34; isn't the worst album of the year. The two lead singles, &#34;I Hope You Suffer&#34; and &#34;17 Crimes&#34;, are decent enough. And &#34;The Sinking Night&#34; is another good AFI album opener.<br />I have enjoyed previous AFI records, and I hope to enjoy future records of theirs. But &#34;Burials&#34;, sadly, just isn't memorable enough to warrant more than a few spins.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Finally something good on TV. Love the characters, scenery, settings, furniture, architecture, transition to cars from carriages, introduction of technology. It's wonderful.
B0091W7K6K|5.0|Steve McQueen was one of the best actors as is his movies. The car car chase in this movie sets the standard of all car chase scenes.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|too bad SyFy had to stop producing this show, we LOVE it.  Cannot wait to watch the other seasons soon.
B000AJIF4E|3.0|I was really excited about these headphones, as they are very well reviewed. Unfortunately, one of the headphones did not play any sound. It was a real shame too, since the other phone produced a very high quality sound. They did not feel cheap either. Odds are, they won't all have this problem, but it really is best to buy headphones in person.
B009QU9X44|3.0|I kept reading because the story is introduced well, tantalizing to find out what will happen. However, with the use of so many African words, where is the glossary? I feel that a lot of the nuance is lost by not knowing the meaning of the frequently used African words in conversation. A pity.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Very interesting and challenging.  Keeps me interested enough to play everyday.  Not sure how well I am doing but it's fun.
B00DQZQPNM|3.0|I really loved this case until I realized I had to turn it backwards to play all games. (Like you were opening a book from the back) It wasn't comfortable holding it that way so I sent it back. Still looking for a new case. Amazon was great about taking it back as always.

B00EAIMGDW|5.0|I haven't had the chance to personally play this yet, but my boys LOVE it! They are 5 and 6 years old and they trade my phone back and forth helping each other out with the game. No fighting with each other over whose turn! Great game!

B009WUBERW|4.0|Have always liked Stallone throughout the years in his basic, yet touching movies that seem to always be a good outcome for the underdog, so to speak.  Great cast; good chemistry, and while somewhat perdictable, still fun to watch.  Looking forward to E3 and E4, and we hear there may be another Rocky movie in the making.  Doing it at an older age gives it a different and interesting twist.
B008Q0AP2E|4.0|First saw this movie years and years ago.  Decided to watch  it again and enjoyed it throughly.  Time does not diminish this film.
B009MYARIK|5.0|Actually laughed out loud in public reading this book. Somewhat predictable but overall a great, easy reading, hard to put down book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it this game.  I play it all day long with the kids lol, my baby girl like it too
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|In true Disney form, \\"Up\\" takes you on an emotional roller coaster.  One moment you're laughing... the next you're crying.  It is a wonderful movie for Disney/Pixar fans of all ages!  It's worth watching over & over...
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|The games are challenging but I don't like waiting for hours to get five lives or having to buy them.
B007WEQ3K8|4.0|I tried this app and found I need to practice a lot more. It was challenging and fun to do.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|Fun game like all the dash games. Keeps you entertained and wanting more.  There are lots of levels so you get your money's worth.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really makes you use your mind. Perfect time killer. The game has a lot of different things that you can use to figure out the puzzles. It is also easy enough for my kids to figure out the puzzles so it is a great game for the whole family.
1410429385|3.0|Series with a reoccurring main character, such as Lee Child's Reacher novels, are books you know what you're going to get going in as obviously the hero is going to come out on top, not die and be around for the next book, so the reading experience is just following him get there.  I've only read two other novels in this series and this one's plots was as interesting as the others.  Basically Reacher helps out a woman with a bad leg and crutch to pick up her dropped dry cleaning and at the next moment has a gun in his face and is being bundled along with her into the back of a car.  Obviously you know this is going to be the worst possible mistake the kidnappers could make.  But like the other two Reacher novels, I found the story contradicted itself at times, especially with the characters' actions, and it has the plausibility at times of an 80's straight to video action movie.<br /><br />But I knew that would be the case, and it was just what I was after.  We all enjoy these sort of books, it's fiction, not non fiction after all.  For me picking them up I know these sorts of books aren't going to be masterpieces or storylines I'll remember in ten years time. It's like if you're stuck in an airport with only a small bit of change left of the local currency, you're plane is delayed, your a bit hungry, there's a vending machine, inside are chocolate bars you've never heard of but look interesting, as well as ones your familiar with sold in your own country that you like but aren't anything great. You know you'll be satisfied and not hungry after with the familiar ones, but that they aren't the greatest chocolate bar experience you could ever eat.  You don't want to take the gamble with your last coins on something that could be way better than what the choices you know, but also you could be throwing in the bin after one bite and left still feeling hungry.<br /><br />If you're unfamiliar with the Reacher books, he sort of reminds me of Parker from Richard Stark's series.  Parker is of course an anti-hero criminal and Reacher a good guy but they are both freakishly huge in build, have over-the-top hand to hand/knife fighting skills, shooting accuracy and ability to outsmart opponents and analyse a tricky situation. One difference with Child's writing to Westlake's (aka Stark) is that he has fairly lengthy word counts describing any action such as shooting a gun, where Child tells the reader how gravity affects a bullet over this amount of distance, then at this distance this happens, and a heap of other stuff before pulling the trigger whereas Westlake had Parker just shoot the guy and we move on.  You'll either enjoy Child's rambling before something happens, or curse it.  Books like Lee Child's Reacher series are the novels you know what you're getting, that they will be enjoyable enough to pass the time, but not plausible enough to be telling everyone else you know, that they've got to read this book!<br /><br />I enjoyed the book and I really enjoyed the other main character Holly, (kidnap victim) who was easily the best of introduced for that particular storyline characters of the three Child books I've read.  Spoilers follow from here on so if you haven't read Die Trying yet, best to stop reading this review here.  I found the villains' actions to be really inconsistent.  They really should have simply shot and killed Reacher when they switched to the truck, being that they had no problem beating up then tying up the car owner and murdering him when setting the car on fire.  Also although maybe it was unbeknownst to the kidnap crew, the tradesman back in the town/compound were equally murdered with no thought, even though they had a greater risk as obviously search parties would start looking for them when they didn't return home.  So Reacher following consistency should have simply been shot at both the truck and also when he got off it at its destination.  This would also have meant more co-operation from Holly who wouldhave known they could potentially kill her is she doesn't do what she's told.  But for this fictional story to work, we obviously needed Reacher to be alive.  Also we are told a few times that the various armed forces can't come in to save the day as this is somehow illegal in maintaining law enforcement (not sure if this true), but then the FBI are quite happy to have a civilian board a helicopter, and go after and kill a suspect for them while they sit along side and go, good job!  There's a lot of other holes in the plot but those are the ones that stood out for me.have known they could potentially kill her is she doesn't do what she's told.

Ultimately the book serves as a manifesto in support of a movement of people who believe they can change the world from anywhere. People who believe in borderless collaboration and creating a better world.

B0064MPXFA|4.0|A friend of mine suggested I might like this show so I tuned in and got immediately hooked. I can't believe it has been on for over five years and I'm just now discovering it. It isn't the soap opera I was expecting -- which is a good thing!
B000OT6V00|5.0|I love Ron Pearlman, and he's awesome in this movie. We sold a metric ton of DVDs at spinstreet a few months ago, and while we sold this one, it's one of the few that got repurchased on Blu-ray. Cause we like it that much.
B0036S4B6M|2.0|The writing was poor and the organization was jumbled--found myself editing as I read, which got in the way if the story.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Each season is great and suspenseful for different reasons, season 2 is no exception. I love all the characters and thought the ending of this season was especially good, though they did try to wrap up a few too many things at the end and didn't quite explain some things (I could have done without the unexplained alien like parts. There were so many other interesting elements to the storyline that they didn't really need that too. Watching season 3 live now as it runs this fall, and it is turning out to be the best one yet, in my opinion, but all are good and very different from each other even though many of the same actors appear in all seasons.
B00FEHXCIG|3.0|I am a big Iron man / Robert Downey Jr fan. I recommend this movie as &#34;its okay&#34; only because you have to be a fan to appreciate the saga, so watch it if you are. You will not be disappointed with Robert Downey Jr, but if your like me? you will be disappointed that their is too much story, and not enough Iron Man action through out the movie. All the Action comes in the end, which I disliked. Not to say that the climax was not worth all the special effects.
B003IPC5SO|5.0|I'm a huge Kylie Minogue fan.  To me, she is the positive energy, upbeat alternative to Madonna and far superior.  In my opinion, this is her very best album.  Yes, even better than the album with &#34;Can't Get You Out Of My Head&#34; on it.  One of the best songs is &#34;Get Outta My Way,&#34;  a driving, fast club song that was a big hit on the dance charts.  There are also some very interesting Youtube videos for this tune.  I had to laugh when I saw her performing this on a float at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, while imagining all the gay boys dancing to it at the clubs.<br />If you're a romantic, like me, you will also enjoy &#34;All The Lovers,&#34; a mid-tempo dance tune with unique and enjoyable instrumentation.  It has a quirky synth melody that really grabs me.  The video for this song is also very beautiful and meaningful.<br />My other favorite song on this collection is Cupid Boy, a light, upbeat, fun song that has a terrific melody and lots of interesting instrumental and vocal changes.<br />Almost every song on this album is good to great.  All hail the Goddess!!!

B00F91RYL8|3.0|Brad Pitt of course makes this movie sing, he would since he was not only the main character, but one of it's producers. It's fast pace with a good story line, so you going have to pay attention. The introduction of the female LT from Isreal who becomes the best supporting actress in this movie was a great choice!
B004JMY312|5.0|Great Halloween classic! Disney nails it with this spooky feature that is enjoyable for adults and children alike. Bette Midler is fantastic!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I live this show ! It is like my new soap opera...I have to get to the computer to watch Another episode.
B0058ZPNOK|5.0|great movie definitely will get more from you guys weird but liked it thank you very much bye for now bye
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|I contacted support because I did not get my diamonds I paid for the next day I lost all of my game progress. the support team only answers support issues during business hours and are closed on the weekend. she I finally got a response asking for a bunch of information then got a response to wait another 48 hours. I still have not had my process restored and had to start from the beginning of the game.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|This dictionary gave my son a hard time his grades dropped all the way to a F and he is in middle school
B000W07EKW|5.0|The collection is basically the three separate releases put together in a fancy box. That was fine with me. The quality was great. I got the full movies in widescreen format and for a fraction of the price. Perfect.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|If you are a fan of Khaled Hosseini you will love this as much as his other work. Such a beautiful writer<br />.<br />.
B00F4PM6WG|5.0|My 2 year old loves this game. She can follow the white hand that points to what she needs to do. Sometimes it takes a few tries for her to move the piece just right. But overall it is great for as young as a 2 year old!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I got the game because I played it on a friends phone and liked it. I do think they should have some instructions with it and stop telling you that you have unlocked weapons to use when you have to buy them to use them. other than that, it's a fun game and I would recommend it to a friend.
B00EP0KBXM|4.0|Every actor has a path to follow.  Jaden Smith is still on the beginning of his.  I think it is appropriate that he is billed before his father in this film.  This is not a Will Smith movie, even though it is based on his story idea.  This is a Jaden Smith movie.  The setup is a little long.  Jaden's character has to come into his own and it doesn't have to be as laborious as the film shows us.  This is a good film to have on instant video and watch while you're waiting at the DMV or to be called as a juror.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I chose the Tudors to view as I am interested in all things about Kings and Queen histories.  The script seems to accurate.  The costumes of the period were remarkable.  I loved the entire series.  This particular season is rated for the mature audience not for high school.<br /><br />Viewing Henry VIII was incredible, and the wives of the king with all the court secrecy and plots was awesome, and apparently, from history real.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|I cannot get enough of The Doctor no matter which actor portrays him.<br /><br />My daughter has been hooked since she was 6 years old.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|one of the best mobile games made, its addictive and sweet.you might even say it is divine if you win.
B00FPH51LQ|4.0|It is not the greatest science fiction film based on a comic book or graphic novel.  Ryan Reynolds would do well to consider getting out of that genre.  This movie borrows from Cop Buddy movies and New Guy Gets Thrust Into A Strange World Everyone Else Is Used To movies, but there are enough new things to keep your interest.  This is a good lazy day movie.  Get this on instant video and watch it on a rainy Saturday.
B005HEPIDS|5.0|best ever! i highly recommend revisiting this old friend if you have a chance, it's nice to revisit this voyage with my trekky nerd friends!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Lee has a great writing style. The character, Jack Reacher, is very believable and you are waiting to see what he does next.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Sheryl writes honestly about her difficulties and successes. She makes good points about men and women. Now I hope as an older educated woman seeking a job I won't be too strident when I speak up.
B00881VLCE|4.0|It has been good so far except times out to frequently! Otherwise I really enjoy this app. Could have a few more puzzles!
B0036S4B6M|4.0|This book was nicely paced and held interest throughout. It was a good depiction of life in prison without being horribly graphic, giving the reader a good sense of life in prison.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|One of the things that hits you before too many minutes into this superb documentary is the VISUAL style of the offering.<br /><br />That's saying something, when it'll be the music alone that will take you through many viewings.<br /><br />So: visually, simply superb, whether creative and compelling re-creations--especially of Don and Glenn's early lives--to the remember-when performance and backstage clips and the recording and concert footage of the band itself.<br /><br />Some have suggested the whole story is a little sugar-y.  Not so: all the members tell it like it was and (more recently) has been, i.e.: Joe Walsh's drugs-and-booze marathons; the on-again, off-again Eagle membership of never-satisfied Don Felder and the bitter-sweet comings and goings of Bernie Leadon and Randy Meisner.<br /><br />Sure, it's the singing and sound.  But above all...the songs. Man, what great, great songs.
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|Highly entertaining new age Godzilla type movie. Weak and awkward romance scene similar to SW episode II. Almost wish there was a sequal or prequel, but this was enough.
0763668966|5.0|I purchased this book for my 10-year-old daughter for her upcoming birthday. She loves geography and I was searching for a detailed book of various maps with descriptions of the many countries, culture, foods, drinks, etc. This book does not disappoint. I can't wait for my daughter to see it!<br />This is a fun book to thumb through.<br /> It does not feature all countries. But, I love the detail of the illustrations and the many random tidbits of each country. Definitely worth the buy!
B00499NHLC|5.0|Excellent character development from the entire cast...even the low level characters.  Love the sarcasm and the quips that Sherlock comes up with.  Always entertaining.
B00992CF6W|4.0|this is app is great for people who love minecraft and need it somewhere besides the p.c. now,  what i wish is that it could be abit.more updated because i am a pc player so im not used to at least having a redstone torch. so great app! It just needs to be updated.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I loved this informative and easy read. I couldn't put it down and ended up finishing it in one night. I love Tesla for his selflessness and integrity!
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|As always with any of the birds games they are. Full time  waster and I guess I love to waste it as I have at Least one copy of all there games on my multiple devices
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Very addictive!! I love to play this game, it is challenging and fun. Play this game every day and still not tired of it.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I'm giving this review a one star because i can't seem to get it working,  i think it miht be a goood one but i don't know
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|When you accept multiple &#34;lives&#34; from friends,one drops off so that you receive one less life. OtOtherwise,  the game is addictive.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game<br />It is nice to finally have it on my kindle<br />the images are clear, I play it all the time
B007SYWFRM|5.0|cool beans. this app ain't bad at all. just wish it didn't take so long to collect off some animals
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I love Alicia.  Her control and professionalism under extreme pressure is endearing.  She also shows the realistic side...she can cry.  She protects her kids at all cost.
1476735115|5.0|this whole series is an amazing adventure. This new author is not to be missed. If you have not read the wool,shift, and dust trilogy you ARE missing out!
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|it is not the classic romantic story, and that's what makes it a very good movie. The actors are pretty good, and makes you laugh and the most important keep you awake.
B00DQZQQN6|5.0|I chose a 5 star because this protects my Kindle Fire HD 2nd Gen extremely well. It was hard to find a good case that fit my kindle. I am happy and recommend this!
1452101248|5.0|Another gift, this time for my neighbour who I hope will cook many of the receipes for me.<br />These 3 books were recommended by a work collegues I am so pleased I purchased them.thank you
B006MW3V6U|5.0|same as my previous posting .i can't stop watching this adventure. I really love the old English way of life.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Same game play as FaceBook. Works great, with better graphics than FaceBook - and no more annoying animation when the bad bombs explode. I think it skips the stories, though.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Very well written and easy to read.  Thought and discussion provoking! A good book to pick up on a rainy day.
B009ZQJVAK|5.0|The actors are best part of this movie. It is a bit of fluff but the actors are fascinating in their roles. The script lags in places however one can't help anticipating what the actors will do next.
B00C7607BC|5.0|I love this movie, and the Diamond Edition is awesome!  I've loved this movie since I was little, and this is my first time owning it.  It's my favorite Disney movie.  And I love the Krab-e-oke!
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|I love the way Susan sings from her heart and soul. She is a miracle, just as Christmas is a miracle.
0525478817|3.0|** SPOILER **<br /> After hearing all the hype about The Fault In Our Stars by John Green, I was very excited when I got the chance to read it. Because of all the positive attention this book had been receiving, I set really high standard. However, after reading the book I was left with a lot of mixed feelings. I thought it was a good book for the most part, but I had two major problems that seriously impacted my opinion on the book. Despite my two major problems with the book, I found myself not being able to put the book down because I was interested in what was going to happen next. I would recommend this book to mostly teenage girls, but I would warn them that it does not live up to what it is cracked up to be.<br /><br />This book was my first John Green book, and I was very impressed. I really liked his style of writing and thought that it was able to drastically boost the success of the book. The way he wrote the book made me want to keep reading, to see what was going to happen next. Green also did a very good job on creating an emotional bond between the book and the readers of the book. I felt like I was in the relationship, feeling the emotions and the heartwarming and heart-wrenching events. I also really enjoyed the actual story line. The love story was so touching because of the two people involved. Augustus and Hazel have gone through a lot and having them so happy was very sentimental. They deserved each other and it was very nice being able to experience the relationship evolve.<br /><br /> On the other hand, I did not like how unrealistic the book was. Augustus and Hazel are teenagers, who haven't known each other for that long. They went to Amsterdam together and Hazel's mom let the two of them walk around a foreign country by themselves. I found that to be very impractical. Also, Hazel and Augustus do not talk nor act like teenagers. I understand they have gone through a lot that the average teenager does not experience, but there actions would not be that different. They both seem way to mature for their age, which made it hard for me (a teenager) to connect with them. I also found this book way to predictable. Two teenagers both experienced cancer, then they magically fall in love, and then one of them dies. The second that Hazel and Augustus met I knew that was going to happen. It was so simple. Because I knew what was going to happen for the majority of the book, it seemed frivolous that I was even reading it. I think I would have been able to enjoy the book a lot more if the ending was more surprising.<br /><br />In general, I would say that the book was mediocre. I do not understand why it is rated so highly and has won many awards. I did enjoy reading the book, but the ending was way to obvious. Maybe with a different ending, I would have understood all the success with this book. But for me, the book was overrated.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Suspense and good plot! I am in the process of creating a new study of the time when I was little.
B009VLXMJA|5.0|I could listen to this album over and over again, and that's just not like me. I love the way she writes her own songs, I think they're songs every age can relate to. This right now has been my favorite album for months. I just never get sick of listening to her.<br />Taylor will be around for a very long time! She puts to music what we've all felt at one time or another!
B00G32QIEG|4.0|My husband and I both enjoyed this movie.  It was fun and unpretentious.  This is a fantasy, and it doesn't pretend to be anything else.  It fell into the category of movies that we want to see but don't want to pay movie theater price.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|so glad it finally came to kindle fire I love it have hard time putting it down. yes I'm addicted at least what my. hubby says
B0092SQ5EG|3.0|If you like Katy, you will like this.<br />Fun, energetic. Worth every penny<br />A great video for being in a slump, gets you<br />moving & whether you want to or not.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Omg so glad I can play candy crash on my kindle fire HD now.  I was dissappoitimg when I got my kindle a few months ago to discover it was not available but so excited when they opened it up to me. Love love this game!!
B00C4GRGQY|5.0|Im only into the first chapter and i have been able to apply the techniques right away.  this book  give me  refferences i can associate with as a semi pro photographer .  I dont really think so but if the book make a turn in the other direction i will post again .
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Another great one!  Love how the story picked right up, and that Danny is so flawed. Now to find out what happens to Abra ;-)
030758836X|4.0|There are twists and turns and they keep you hanging on...I would suggest this book to anyone who likes a good mystery.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|This series is very entertaining. It has high drama and adventure that keeps you sitting on the edge of your seat. Then some of the episodes are so funny you laugh through it. It has quite a spectrum of episodes that provoke all the emotions. We love this series and can't wait to sit down and watch the next one. We usually watch several in an evening, especially on the weekends.
B008AX1HD8|4.0|Some great characters and twists. High quality writing and an exciting plot - worth reading and I'll definitely try another 'Harry Hole' novel (or two!).
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Good app but not great. It is not as good as the app on my iPhone.<br />But it does the basic job.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Don't want to spoil anything so you must read all books and see what all the hype is about I promise you you'll be happy you read it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I can't believe how much fun it is challenging my friends.  I just can't put it down. Give it a try
B00FWLSLJ4|3.0|For the action alone this movie was perfect. It was exciting, beautiful, unique, all of it. The characters and acting though was mediocre. I like the actors very much as well which makes that unusual. Oh well, a solid 3 star movie I think though anyway.
B00G32TD98|5.0|One of the most frightening movies I have ever seen.  Not for the faint of heart.  I would see it again.
0553593714|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read. Game of Thrones is a nice departure from all of the other fantasy stories. A splendid blend of fantasy, suspense and intrigue. George R.R. Martin is a master storyteller.
B003FC6WBQ|5.0|Absolutely classic. With witty writing, spot-on delivery, and perfect casting, this movie is a brilliant showcase for brilliant actors. Of course it is from another time and the social messages haven't exactly kept up with progress, but you've got to accept that and move on (or you can turn it into a game -- when domestic violence, alcoholism, etc. are played for a laugh, you drink!)
B00FWLSLJ4|3.0|The effects are over the top good, very nice. If only half the effort went into the story, it's just...alright. Probably some of the nicest workmanship on props and overall feeling to get this story across. Although I think they do good back story some of the scenes are unnecessary. Worth the rent overall, buying it is another story.
B00ARHAAZ6|2.0|Weak plot, characters you don't care about, writing is just good enough to keep you interested.  Probably fits better as YA. I will not be reading any more of this series.
1455523550|5.0|Enthralling, intense. I was ensnared from the get-go and didn't want it to end. Nicholas Sparks at his very best.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|I'm reviewing books I read as a child understanding the story more. I enjoyed this one.  Hopefully I will read it again.
B0060AY6FO|2.0|I was expecting a typical P D James mystery--interesting & intriguing.  What I got was a tedious &#34;retelling&#34; of Miss Austen's novel that did not have any of the charm of the original.  The added mystery portion was not very interesting and certainly not up to the usual P D James standards.
B000E41MRC|5.0|With this film the Nationalist Socialist Workers Party of Germany showed the depression era world what was possible with insightful leadership, nationalism, class solidarity and national pride..  Adolf Hitler is the most studied man of the 20th century and lifted his countrymen from the calamity of first world war debt and world depressing that had been imposed on Germany.  As a human being and great leader Adolf Hitler made huge mistakes, we all do...  perhaps his worst mistake was losing the war.  This man was able to join Communism and Capitalism into one huge force to bury his challenging triumph of his ideals and will..  I loved the strength of the film that was authorized by Der Feuher and Dr. Goebbels themselves.  You can't beat that!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Awesome book! So good I read it in 6 days! Can't wait to start the second book! I have to see what happens!  A must read! Book was well executed!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love it. It is a great book I just can not stop reading it sometimes I even bring it to school just read it and not eat lunch
B006ISJQBM|4.0|Blu-ray was new and wrapped. Film is definitely not for lovers of the book, same idea as novel but lacks all of thompson's subtlety.
B00BM1AJIO|1.0|I lost 105 coins for this app. I hope to be refunded. Amazon needs to look into these apps that take money and do not deliver, that's called stealing i believe. Stay away from this one. It will not load.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|Excellent movie. Bought it as a birthday gift which my fruend also loved. As always Amazon us the go to place to get things fast and in good condition.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I had a lot of fun reading this first book of the Jack Reacher series.  The first person perspective was a refreshing change from the usual third person narrative.  The author has a crisp style of writing, yet the descriptions of the places and events are detailed enough to allow one to see the scenes clearly and feel as though one is there. I found the characters to come alive on the page, and the action moved along at a very good pace.  I think what also helped in my enjoyment was reading the introduction by the author which gives an interesting insight into the development of Jack Reacher.
1878424319|4.0|this book is very insightful and has many great tips on how to live a normal and healthy lifestyle without anymore resentments and insecurities
B006LXQID8|5.0|Interesting and unique storytelling, takes the viewer in a very exciting journey through Amelie's life. Colorful and interesting framing makes you laugh and cry with her.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I have a blast playing this game. The levels are challenging and the bonuses provide an incentive to be more accurate.
B00466HN72|5.0|Cute, entertaining for all ages, and even has a great lesson taught.<br />Wonderful family entertainment.  The Easter Bunny needs to live forever
B003O86FMW|5.0|I read the entire book in 2 days flat, and I already have the third book next to me now.<br />There is not enough praise for this series
B000HKYN74|5.0|I loved Deep Space 9 so an arc was a welcome addition to the show.  The xindi mystery unfolded at a good pace with a few clunker episodes in there but overall I was happy to see this show move in the direction it did.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|The Walking Dead brings cinema quality to the small screen. A terrific cast, an apocalyptic plot line, and excellent writing makes this show a must watch. It just keeps getting better!
B00CL151G4|5.0|As a British Literature major.. one who reads, studies, and teaches this literature... I have to applaud the creators and writers of the show Elementary.  I adore Jonny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu.  Almost from the first show, I have liked this  series.  I have a bad habit of watching adaptations of great literature only to be sadly disappointed.  The characterization is frequently altered and when they do that--the characters take on traits not in the literature and for me, it's a failure.  Elementary seems to have captured the characterization of both Holmes and Watson... making it a good mix.  So, from a skeptic, take my word for it... this series is a winner!  I was thrilled with the way they introduced Moriarty.
B00FWLDHSY|2.0|Special affects are on par with blockbusters but the story line is not. It was about an hour too long for what they were trying to accomplish. Overall I will not be watching this again or recommending it to anyone.
B0018OIK0E|5.0|After watching the World's End, I decided to take a road down nostalgia to see the movie that started it all for Pegg and Frost.  The movie is hilarious!  Enjoy this flick some night you need to laugh for an hour.
B008133MDK|4.0|I like the way BBC redid the classic Sherlock Holmes with a twist and update of characters.  It was great fun!
1616890835|5.0|Sign painters are like the tattoo artists of the commercial art world. This is a cool book and it will inspire envy I guarantee. It's more of a love letter to the trade and to certain individuals who have made a name for themselves. Now just to find a reference manual for learning the skills.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|Not the best season, ever made, but it's Supernatural.  This leads into season 9, which i gotta say has found it's second wind.  Great clif hanger into the next season!  This show may not be as well known as other network offerings, but i've been watching since season 5, and this has to be one of my favorite shows on TV.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Some King's recent writtings were so mediocre,I was becoming very worried that King was done. Well, thank God he not. Doctor Sleep is right up there with his best.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|CERTAIN LEVELS ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO PASS, IN PARTICULAR LEVEL70, THEREFOR, I AM LOSING INTEREST IN THE GAME.<br />OTHERWISE I WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT A BETTER RATING.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Tina Fey is a very funny comedian. She writes just like she appears on tv. She's a very funny person.
B0092SQ5EG|5.0|I'm embarrassed to admit, but I'm in my 40's and I love - love Katy Perry!  I love her music and she is such an inspiring role model for all ages who outshines other female musicians that try to get exposure by exposing themselves to a ridiculous degree (AKA - Miley Cyrus and Lady Gaga).  While sex sells, it is anything but art and Katy Perry in this film displays how she persevered and had the courage to come out on top by being herself and showing how to be a true artist.  There were awkward moments in the film, but I thought it was well done and fun to witness Katy's rise to stardom.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Good calculator.  Works well on kindle.  I would recommend it for personal use. It's free so the price is right.
B00G32TD98|4.0|I'm a big fan of this genre, so I was excited to see this movie.  It's very refreshing to see a movie of this sort shot in the traditional sense.  Since Paranormal Activity practically every movie in the genre had been of the &#34;found footage&#34; style and most are crap.  I'm also a big fan of how this movie doesn't have a lot of the &#34;cheap scares&#34; where something just pops out of nowhere rarely with any sort of payoff.  Most of the acting is done well, and the film builds to nice climax.  I gave the movie only four stars because it doesn't break any new ground, but what it does, it does well.  If you'd like to watch a well done horror movie this Halloween, I suggest you give the Conjuring a try.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game and Im happy kindle has it. Wish Microsoft would join too....that way we can all play no matter what device we use.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|No wonder this had 19 Emmy nominations. The complexity of the characters are so well writing you don't know what's going to happen next. Not sure if season 3 is going to live up to this quality. Not for the faint of heart.
B004US4K2C|3.0|Undecided. Not sure what this app is supposed to do.  I got it hoping it would help my kindle to stay connected to the web.  I think my problem is my kindle.  It has always had a problem with staying connected.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|Every chapter's end was a total cliff hanger and kept me wanting more! A very good read that keeps you on the edge of your seat!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy crush saga is addictive!!  I sometimes get stuck but thanks to my wonderful friends they help me.  Some are very challenging.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book has you right from the start.  The writing style is unusual but as soon as I got used to it I just couldn't put the book down.  Would have given it 5 stars except for the ending.  I highly recommend this book makes you question how well we really know anyone.
B00BXKKNFS|5.0|Works well.  Keeps all those unwanted ads from popping up everywhere.  I would recommend this app for people who hate being bombarded with unwanted ads.
B008476HBM|5.0|One of my very favorite books. Jane Austen was amazingly talented and this is only one of her many classics.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|A little difficult, but a fun ever changing game. I just wish the extras didn't cost so much. I will keep playing occasionally.
B005K17RU0|5.0|this is the best weather app u can get it tells u everything u would want to know about the weather.
B004UG7RQ0|5.0|It wasn't until after I purchased an Android phone did I realize every sound docking station apparatus I owned was designed for an iPod/iPhone, but I finally found a female adapter that works on all of the portable docking stations I own, including, most important, my $300 Brookstone speaker tower!<br /><br />It doesn't seem to work in my car, BUT-I refuse to blame the manufacturer of this simple device for not being compatible with a complicated after-market stereo system sound/navigation system installed by Car Toys (plus I'VE never gone back to Car Toys to see if they can swap out the adapter, which is certainly NOT the manufacturers fault!)
B00CHVIPP2|5.0|My kids have watched this movie at least 20 times if not more and they run around the house with the Belt toy pretending to be him. Great value.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This really is a great book about the digital age and the beginning of it all!<br />I would recommend it to anyone!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think it's tots cool it's fun to dodge all these things and have goals and get new minions for you
B00F35B8F8|5.0|Better than the first, and the cast (I know heresy) better than the original. thoroughly enjoyed great actions, just not enough Scotty.
B004GCPJDQ|1.0|I got this in March and did not have to use it until early October as the batteries that came with the keyboard were good until then. I was excited to use this. I plugged it in, let it charge overnight. I woke up in the morning and went to check my email and the mouse was not working. For some reason, the off button keeps getting pushed with this replacement bottom. I clicked it back to the &#34;on&#34; position and then it connected and I was surprised to see the battery level at only 58% after it charged all night, so I charged it again before I left for work and came back to find the same battery level 10 hours later!!!<br /><br />Also, the other thing is that you must take the back off that came with it and replace it with the Mobee back since the battery is attached to it to charge. When you are moving the mouse, the back moves so that is why it clicks off the power button. I have tried many times to adjust it and it keeps happening.<br /><br />I would not recommend this. The battery level did not go above 58% and then it dropped to 25% within 2 days. I wasn't eligible for a refund since I waited so long to use it, but I will NEVER recommend this to anyone. I had to go out and buy batteries. I like the idea of it, but it simply did not work for me. Maybe it was defective, but I learned my lesson. Very dissatisfied I have a product I paid for and can't do anything with. :(
0811879542|4.0|I bought this bool because I thought my 3 year old son would have so much fun with it.  He liked the first few pages but then lost interest.  My 1 year old was more entertained.

1401917232|4.0|If you have read Gary's first two books &#34;The Disappearance of the Universe&#34; and or &#34;Your Immortal Reality&#34; this book will be a great addition to that series, if not it may be very confusing. Gary does a fair amount of whining in this book which really surprised me but it does help to show that this is a process and not a destination.<br />If you are new to this author I would suggest reading &#34;The Disappearance of the Universe&#34; first, for me it was the best of the series.

B008ER9QLK|1.0|Anyone considering purchasing this Ring is advised to get the DVD recording of their older production.  The singing is much better (Voigt is quite pale compared to Behrens; she should have never agreed to take on that role.  In order to project most of the music, her voice has taken on an annoying chesty, \\"chalky\\" quality.) The production is near ideal, (the only clear cut failure is the representation of Fafner in Siegfried (he looks like a reject from a 1950's B horror film) and though I far prefer Luisi over Levine, the latter is in his best form and doesn't opt for his usually lugubrious tempos and excessive volumes.<br /><br />(Anyone who has spent just a few minutes following a Wagner score will notice that conductors nearly ALWAYS fail to follow his numerous \\"piano\\" indications.  Even in \\"loud\\" sections, you will notice that the orchestral phrases are almost always asked to drop to the piano level just after the opening blast for the purpose of allowing the singer to be heard.  Most conductors ignore this request pretty consistantly.  Janowski is one of the few who does and he was mercilessly criticized for conducting an \\"undernourished\\" Ring.  Most critics and listeners simply don't know what they're talking about.)<br /><br />But the key negative factor is the production.  Most of the costumes are pretty idiotic.  The Rheinmaidens look like waitresses at a gay bar and Rastafarian Alberich complete with dreds is seriously out of place.  Most everything else is accomplished with the use of projections which sometimes work admirably and other times fail miserably.<br /><br />However, it's the series of two dozen gigantic seesaws that dooms this production.  When upright, the performers are constrained to move only laterally; seriously limiting the blocking and stage action.  When oriented horizontally, coming straight at you, they just look ridiculous.  Given the investment of time, money, and promotion, I suppose their stuck with this turkey for quite a while.  Perhaps they can sell the ridiculous contraption to the Cirque de Soleil, a vacuous, pointless and jumbled theatrical potpourri, where it would probably work beautifully?!?<br /><br />As poor as it is, the production is not nearly as bad as the recent Bayreuth Lohengrin and Parsifal productions.  The Parsifal, complete on youtube, ranks as one of the dumbest things I've ever seen.  Nothing on the stage has anything to do with the myth or the work.  It's just complete and total crap.  At Kundry's entrance a bunch of kids pop out, gather around, knock down and beat up a hobby horse while being chastized by adults dressed like guests at Brighton Beach resort c. 1900.  Oh yes, the knights wear giant black bird wings.  In the Lohengrin, most of the chorus are dressed as mice or at least where large mouse tails.  You figure.<br /><br />What infuriates me the most about these Eurotrash productions is not simply the ignorance and overall stupidity of present day stage directors who feel they have a free hand to attack any great work in any way they wish in order to suit their demented \\"vision.\\"  It's that we finally live in an age in which the technology would allow for Wagner's original vision and stage directions to be successfully represented on stage and or film for the first time in history and THIS garbage is all we get.  Terrific.

1250030951|3.0|I'm so torn about this book! There were some parts I loved and other things that really bothered me. I did enjoy the book, it just didn't blow me away.<br /><br />Fangirl was my first Rainbow Rowell read, and I've got to hand it to her, the woman has a serious talent for storytelling. The writing was exceptional and so unique and fresh compared to what I've read in the past. The humor and witty dialogue captured my attention right off the bat and I took an immediate liking to the characters.<br /><br />Things I loved:<br />* Levi. Obviously. I loved that he was quirky and a little nerdy in his own right, and wasn't ridiculously over-the-top good looking. He felt like a real person. His adoration of Cath was incredibly sweet and I loved his happy-go-lucky attitude.<br />* Reagan. I adored her sarcasm and no-BS approach to life. I appreciated her continual efforts to push Cath out of her comfort zone.<br />* The dialogue. Some of the most enjoyable conversations I've ever had the pleasure of reading in a book. And they made me laugh constantly!<br />* Wren and Cath. Rainbow Rowell did an amazing job with her portrayal of the bond sisters have with one another.<br /><br />Now....onto a few things that bugged me. I think what hindered me the most from loving this story was my inability to fully connect with/relate to Cath. As time went on and her obsession with Simon Snow and writing fanfiction was described in more detail, I found none of it really resonated with me. And it began to annoy me to no end that Cath refused to do anything besides hide in her dorm room and lose herself in a fantasy world. There were a lot of times she messed up her priorities and I just wanted her to move on. I also found her to be quite dramatic. Her reactions to certain things just felt a lot more high school than college, and it threw me off from time to time.<br /><br />Overall, this was just an ok read for me. I definitely still want to read Rainbow Rowell's other books, I just don't think this was the right choice for me in terms of subject matter.ink this was the right choice for me in terms of subject matter.

B00475BUVM|3.0|Not a great film, though fairly entertaining with decent special effects. This DVD was purchased as part of a package deal with another 3D DVD (I had to choose a 2nd 3D DVD to get the deal). If you like this sort of action film, save some money & buy a non-3D Blu-Ray versions of it.

0765326353|5.0|I deliberately don't have a way to purchase things online to keep my budget in order, but I loved this book so much I wanted the hardcover and not the two paperbacks in the brick-and-mortar stores, so I bugged my brother and paid him back. It's a much better cover art than the paper versions and it's very durable. I had it open flat all night and yet the next day had not so much as a crease or indent in the spine. The story's great, but then I'm a big Sanderson fan in general. I'd put it up there with Warbreaker, and above Mistborn or Elantris. When it gets a sequel I'll probably rate it higher for the continuity value.<br />My first time purchasing something on Amazon. Usually I'm a tough judge, or at least I like to think so, yet I've given a five here. It came in one piece and much earlier than expected considering I live Down Under.<br />I'd write the flaws, but honestly I'm perfectly happy. Sorry Amazon, but at this rate I definitely can't afford to start buying much online if this is how addicted I would get, but good job!

B0001MLMKY|4.0|This watch is great and simple! The only issue that stopped me from wearing it is the loud tick-tock sound that makes me pretty anxious. It's almost like having a timer reminding you every second that time is going by and disrupting my attention span. I'm thinking of taking it to get that problem taken care of.. Until then, I can't wear it and deal with its super loud ticking sound.
B00F87ZUYG|4.0|I often find myself thinking that the people in these shows make terrible decisions which artificially inflate the level of drama in the show. Yes I understand drama is the point of the show, but the people in the show seem to take unnecessary risks (going places alone, not watching their backs, etc.). With that said, I can't stop watching the show. I find the characters engaging, the plot twists exciting, and the interaction between the characters exciting.

B003N2P426|4.0|I regret to say that OUP has issued an edition of this remarkable novel that lacks an accessible table of contents. Which means it's hard to navigate by-chapter, as most readers would want to do. The editorial apparatus, on the other hand, seems intact.

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I found the book compelling and wonderfully written. There needs to be a follow up movie to the story &#34;A Time to Kill.&#34; The continuance of characters made the story come of the page.

B00EJOCB4G|5.0|My son loves Minecraft.  He had fun constructing this set, and can't wait to add on the other sets.  He uses the Zombir-Pigmen and Ghast figures to go up against any LEGO mini figures that dare tread into the Netherworld.  It's challenging, because it has many, tiny pieces.  Maybe not for every child, but my eight year old loves it.  It builds into four segments, which connect together in different ways (go figure... it's LEGOs).
B00BRUQ3PS|5.0|I am a long time admirer of Margaret Atwood and a genuine fan of her books.  Her stories are thought provoking, her prose is lyrical, and her characters are very human, very real.<br /><br />This book is no different.  A beautiful end piece for the trilogy that brings home the pieces, stories and people in the first two books.  I specifically don't use the phrase 'loose ends' because there really are no loose ends in the books.  Each stands on its own as a remarkable story and piece of fiction; this book is no exception.<br /><br />For those who have not yet read this book or the previous MaddAddam books, I won't go into any details that would impinge upon the joy of discovery as a first time reader, but I will mention that Ms. Atwood again provides both an ending for the main storyline of the book(s) and an open-endedness that points toward a future and an a sense of &#34;ongoing-ness,&#34; (if you'll allow me a little flexibility with language here).<br /><br />This book was thought-provoking and engaging.  I Loved It!!

B005TVYVI2|1.0|I ordered one of these despite some reservations I had based on reviews.  The first one came in and it wouldn't turn on.  I changed to a fresh battery, but still wouldn't do anything.  I returned it. The second one came in and it too never turned on even after, like the first, I put in a fresh battery. Seriously, neither of them would turn on.  Gave up and send the second one back and asked for a refund.  Very frustrating experience and it's too bad there aren't any others on the market.  I'd really like to use one to help improve my distance strokes.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|I can't even put into words how disappointing this book was for me. Yes, I dislike the ending and found it profoundly lacking, but I'll save that for last.<br /><br />First of all, despite it being YA, I still expect it to be decently written and engaging- and Allegiant suffered on both accounts. The dual viewpoints between Tris and Four sounded like a good concept, and one I was ready to get behind...but in practice it's messy, non-cohesive and somehow despite the constant shifting, very monotonous. The first 2 books gave me the sense that Roth was really finding her voice and improving, so I was ready to forgive the first signs of these problems I saw; except that they continued throughout the entirety of the book. It became hard to recall if you were in Tris' POV or Four's, and the value of their separate perspectives suffered as a result. It got to the point where I really lost interest in the story altogether, only continuing in hopes that it would regain footing and reveal something worthwhile.<br /><br />I resisted the temptation to look into spoilers. So I read no reviews, didn't listen to Roth's explanation of her ending or even talk about the book with anyone further along. So my initial reaction was a very surprised, strongly negative one. I doubted very much that her words on the matter would change my thought, but I was still curious and did listen/read what she had to say. It left me somehow even more disappointed. So Tris was finally grown up, self-aware and ultimately WORTHY enough to sacrifice herself? That's her powerful, 'righteous' ending? I'm not saying it should have been a clear cut case of Tris and Four walking into the sunset, never to have further struggles or fighting to evolve further....but to say neither of them is deserving of the proper ending together; and that Tris finally became who she wanted, and who her parents would have been proud of, only to die is fitting- seems a little wrong to me. It seems to me Roth was just so desperateto be different and NOT have them 'ride into the sunset' that she felt the need to ruin any further development there could have been.<br /><br />So I muddled through the unimpressive writing, terrible POV shifting and struggles all for an ending that ruins everything leading up to it. I'm incredibly disappointed with this book, from start to finish.
006202406X|5.0|Warning this review is going to be honest, extremely emotional, and a wee bit long.  There will also be spoilers from Divergent and Insurgent.  Any spoilers for Allegiant will be put in spoiler section.<br /><br />The Divergent series means a lot to me.  It's something that holds a special place deep within me.  In fact, I fear I may start crying while writing this review because just thinking about it gets me really emotional.  I've also had the pleasure of meeting the author Veronica Roth on a few occastions.  I first read Divergent about a month after it's release back in June 2011.  It's the first series that I pretty much have been following since it's initial publication.  I think that's one of the reasons why I feel so protective of it.  I've never really been a part of the beginning of a fandom.  It's been amazing watching the Divergent community grow and grow.<br /><br />Allegiant picks up right where Insurgent left off.  I feel that this series is one book divided into three parts because of this.  The beginning of each book picks right up where the last book ended.  This is something that I actually really like, even though it can make it a bit confusing if it's been awhile since you've read them.  Which is what happened to me when I read Insurgent.  So before Allegiant came out, I did a re read of both Divergent and Insurgent.  And I was pleased to find out that there were certain hints dropped as early as the first book that there could be something outside of the fence.  In chapter eleven when Tris sees a Dauntless guard closing the gate, she notices that the lock is on the outside.  And then she narrates, \\"Why would they lock the gate from the outside and not the inside?  It almost seems like they don't want to keep something out; they want to keep us in.\\"  I love it when authors foreshadow, especially when it goes right over your head the first time you read it!<br /><br /> After having a slight panic at midnight on the book's release date, when the book didn't download onto my Kindle at exactly midnight, I started reading.  I read the first few chapters, and then went to bed.  I woke up the next morning and checked the reviews online.  They were mostly negative.  But I tried to not let it affect me.  From what I had gathered from the glimpses of the reviews I read was that they didn't like the ending.  People who don't like an ending can let that affect their overall feelings for a book series.  And I get it.  It's amazing to feel so close to characters.  To worry about their fate.  Great but fearful.  Because of this while reading Allegiant I kept trying to predict what would happen and imagined the worse case scenarios.  Even though I just wanted to read, I just couldn't.  I love this world.  I feel connected it to it.  But then I realized that by letting others opinions cloud my judgement, it was affecting my enjoyment of the book.  And I want to make it clear, I enjoyed it.  I loved this book.<br /><br />As readers we got to see a glance at what goes through Tobias's head with the short novella \\"Free Four.\\"  But Allegiant is told from a dual point of view.  From Tris and Tobias's point of view.  Fortunately for me, dual point of views don't bother me because I've read many stories and books from different character perspectives.  Also by the end of the first book Divergent, the story really started to warp from being just Tris's story, to Tris and Tobias's story.  Yes, it probably will be weird for some to read the dual point of views, and there were a few times in which I forgot whose point of view I was reading from.  But overall it really does work.<br /><br />Some of my favorite scenes from Allegiant were the scenes between Tris and Tobias.  They are just so well written.  I smile just thinking about them.  They are just a beautiful couple.  But at the same time I liked the scenes between Tris and her brother Caleb.  I didn't see Caleb's betrayal coming in Insurgent.  Veronica Roth has said that Calebis neither good nor bad.  And I definitely got this vibe from him.  To see Tris struggle with whether or not she could forgive him showed us a different side of her.  I am so used to the Tris that told Al, that he disgusted her and called him a coward.  I always gathered that once Tris had an opinion of you, it was permanent.  It was nice to see her see it through a shade of gray.<br /><br />Family issues was a pretty big focus through out the novel, because Tobias struggled with his mother Evelyn.  I hated Evelyn in Insurgent.  And I figured out that the only reason why I didn't like her was because she didn't like Tris.  But Evelyn is really strong.  And a lot of her decisions branch from her being in an abusive relationship and pretty much starving the past few years.  I am glad that we got to see her from Tobias's point of view because his feelings for her are definitely different than Tris's.<br /><br />Friendship is another factor.  Before I started Allegiant, I was surprised at how few characters from the beginning of the series were still alive after Insurgent.  We'd started off with so many, and slowly characters were being picked off.  I am glad that Tris has Christina.  I was proud of Christina in Insurgent, when she forgave Tris for killing Will.  Their friendship is a perfect example of a great adolescent friendship.  Great character development has always been a strong point in this series.<br /><br />The main plot of Allegiant involves the characters going outside of the fence.  And my heart was pounding as they journeyed to parts unknown.  I was just as curious as they were to what awaited them.  But I also chuckled at their naivety to certain things such as an airplane and \\"Coca-Cola\\". New characters were introduced and a few new things which included scientific terms like genetics.  Now normally science can confuse me, it wasn't one of my strongest subjects in school, but it's explained in a way that it's easy to understand.  Because of this I was able to breeze right through the plot with no problems.<br /><br />I've invested so much with these characters and because I've had so much time in between each book, they've been in my head for so long.  That I've imagined scenarios with them in my head.  This is a first for me.  And it makes it difficult to remember that these are not my characters.  And that the situations that I created are not a reality.  And I believe that this is one of the factors of why there are such negative reviews for Allegiant.  When you fall in love with a series, you want a happily ever after.  We grow up with Disney movies and fairy tales, that tell us that even if things are really bad in the end everything will work out just fine.  We forget that we are not the author of the books that we love.  And even though authors love and appreciate reader feedback, in the end they decide our beloved characters fates.  Divergent isn't a fairytale.<br /><br />*The next few paragraphs will be me discussing the ending of Allegiant.  Lots of spoilers ahead.*<br /><br />Tris's death was really touching for me. I cried, but I was smiling at the same time. I've never read a book with an ending like that. I think in the end Tris was brave. She also wasn't sane. And she didn't want to die in vain. When she decided to take Caleb's place to stop the memory serum from being released, I was so proud of her. To see her make her final journey, to commit her final act, was just so emotional. And I don't think all readers got that. Most are just so concerned on the fact that she was killed. You have to really examine the situation before you make a final judgement. Most of the reviews I have read are being written in the heat of the moment, and are just initial thoughts and feelings. That's why I purposely waited a few days before I finished writing my review. If Caleb had gone, she wouldn't have been able to forgive herself. And she probably wouldn't have been the same. I don't think Tobias would have beenenough. One person can't save you completely. They can help, but I am tired of books where being in love is the end all of everything. Tobias's reaction to her death was so moving. And to see Tobias cry, was so important. I actually felt like he was Tobias in that moment, not Four.<br /><br />Evelyn choosing Tobias over revenge was also touching. They both chose to be mother and son. During the epilogue, reading their changed relationship just made me smile. And Tobias as a politician? He's definitely got my vote! Tobias has grown so much. The final scene with him going down the zip line of the Hancock building to spread Tris's ashes really chokes me up. It's so beautiful.

That I've imagined scenarios with them in my head.  This is a first for me.  And it makes it difficult to remember that these are not my characters.  And that the situations that I created are not a reality.  And I believe that this is one of the factors of why there are such negative reviews for Allegiant.  When you fall in love with a series, you want a happily ever after.  We grow up with Disney movies and fairy tales, that tell us that even if things are really bad in the end everything will work out just fine.  We forget that we are not the author of the books that we love.  And even though authors love and appreciate reader feedback, in the end they decide our beloved characters fates.  Divergent isn't a fairytale.<br /><br />*The next few paragraphs will be me discussing the ending of Allegiant.  Lots of spoilers ahead.*<br /><br />Tris's death was really touching for me. I cried, but I was smiling at the same time. I've never read a book with an ending like that. I think in the end Tris was brave. She also wasn't sane. And she didn't want to die in vain. When she decided to take Caleb's place to stop the memory serum from being released, I was so proud of her. To see her make her final journey, to commit her final act, was just so emotional. And I don't think all readers got that. Most are just so concerned on the fact that she was killed. You have to really examine the situation before you make a final judgement. Most of the reviews I have read are being written in the heat of the moment, and are just initial thoughts and feelings. That's why I purposely waited a few days before I finished writing my review. If Caleb had gone, she wouldn't have been able to forgive herself. And she probably wouldn't have been the same. I don't think Tobias would have beenenough. One person can't save you completely. They can help, but I am tired of books where being in love is the end all of everything. Tobias's reaction to her death was so moving. And to see Tobias cry, was so important. I actually felt like he was Tobias in that moment, not Four.<br /><br />Evelyn choosing Tobias over revenge was also touching. They both chose to be mother and son. During the epilogue, reading their changed relationship just made me smile. And Tobias as a politician? He's definitely got my vote! Tobias has grown so much. The final scene with him going down the zip line of the Hancock building to spread Tris's ashes really chokes me up. It's so beautiful. Him facing his fears to love and honor her memory by doing something that she loved is brave. It's captured so perfectly on paper, that I can visualize it really well.<br /><br />Is this the ending that I would have wanted for Tris and Tobias? Of course not.

B000W93CHC|5.0|I read this book immediately after finishing &#34;Pillars of the Earth&#34;.  Having heard that it was a sequel to that book, I was initially disappointed that &#34;WWE&#34; is set approximately 300 years in the future, therefore the characters were all new.  This book, however, was an engaging read.

1250012570|5.0|There are books out there that you read, enjoy, and then move on. Eleanor & Park by Rainbow Rowell is not one of those. I'm not saying it was a bad book, actually the opposite. It is so captivating and moving that it stays with you; at least in my case it did. There aren't many books that I can say I've read in a day and wanted to reread over and over but this was one of them. I started it on my way to work and didn't put it down until I finished around midnight. It was just that good.<br /><br />Eleanor & Park tells the story about first love and how it can be exciting, all consuming, scary and different. It shows how that love could be perfect to you but to everyone else strange. Omaha 1986 is where we find Eleanor, 16, the new girl at school and she already has some strikes against her. She isn't the average cheerleader type. She wears strange hand-me down clothes, she isn't thin and she has wild red hair. Park, also 16, is the half Korean kid who is slightly different from his classmates and even family, just trying to survive high-school with as few scars as possible. For me, I pictured a chunky Molly Ringwald and John Cusack from Say Anything.<br /><br />With awkward beginnings on a school bus, Eleanor and Park start an odd friendship and infatuation with each other. Even with all the butterflies that their romance causes, there is more to these characters. Eleanor is cloaked in mystery from the beginning and what Rainbow does so beautifully is reveal her dark home life like a budding flower, petal by petal. And if Eleanor's life is dark, Park's would definitely be the light. His father and Korean mother provide an example of how two people from two completely different backgrounds could find love and make it work.<br /><br />If I wasn't swooning at how intense Eleanor and Park felt for each other, \\"\\"I don't like you, Park,\\" she said, sounding for a second like she actually meant it. \\"I...\\" -her voice nearly disappeared- \\"think I live for you.\\"\\"; I was laughing my ass off at something Park's mother had said or done, \\"\\"Fighting!\\" she said, stabbing her index finger into his chest. \\"Fighting life white-trash dumb monkey...\\"\\"<br /><br />Rainbow didn't shy away from the different when it came to this book. Having the main characters not look like the norm or ignore the fact that there were minorities in the town, spoke volumes. Her characters were relatable and the story was timeless. This could have easily been a story about two teens in this decade and instead of mixtapes and albums, there could be mp3s and iPods and it would still mean the same.<br /><br />If you are a fan of 80's movies and have a soft spot for the underdog, then this story is for you. This book made me fall in love with love in a way that I wasn't expecting. I was recommended this book to read by many friends and here I am paying it forward.<br /><br />Reviewed by Nikki Guest Reviewer @ Step Into Fictiong my ass off at something Park's mother had said or done, \\"\\"Fighting!\\" she said, stabbing her index finger into his chest. \\"Fighting life white-trash dumb monkey...\\"\\"<br /><br />Rainbow didn't shy away from the different when it came to this book.

I don't have anything against UltraViolet but I am deep in the iTunes ecosystem and prefer to keep all my digital content in one system. The show gets 5 stars but 4 stars for the DVDs because the digital copy does not include iTunes. This is such a good show I will be buying it through iTunes directly.

B0071BY2OG|5.0|A sequel to \\"Faster\\", \\"Fastest\\" as narrated by Ewan McGregor, wonderfully documents the highest motorcycle racing class in the world, MOTOGP. Following the ups and downs, particularly the injuries and struggles of many racers, this film does a fantastic job of showing the fan (new or old) what MOTOGP racing is all about.<br /><br />With special focus on MotoGP's biggest riders, the film showcases the battle between teammates Valentino Rossi and Jorge Lorenzo. Unique insight into the powerful and dramatic racing matchup of the world's greatest riders, is just part of what makes this film great to watch.<br /><br />Ewan does a great job of narrating the film just as in Faster, and the cinematic value is awesome. As with any great Motorsport film, you will want some decent speakers to hear these incredible machines at 200+ mph.<br /><br />Absolute must watch for any motorcycle/motorsport fan!

B00BC24NT4|5.0|This book left me chilled right to the bone.  Extraordinary renditions, intelligence gathering and secret ops outsourced to private contractors, the revolving door between government and private companies, secret trials, deniability and lack of accountability....  It's all here.  Heaven help the poor person who tries to do the right thing.<br /><br />So many longtime authors rest on their laurels and turn out the same, phoned-in story over and over again.  Not John Le Carre.  This book is carefully plotted and beautifully written by an author at the top of his game.  He leaves no doubt about what he thinks of the way the war on terror is being conducted.  This book comes straight from the heart.  It left me with a lot to think about.  I highly recommend it.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|Not as tongue-in-cheek as his travel books, One Summer tells the story of one very busy season in America, the years leading to each episode, and the repercussions after. Using the historic flight of Charles Lindbergh as an anchor, this book does its best to - in a conversational voice - inject a little humor and understanding into the period.<br /><br />Bill Bryson seems to have slowly moved on from his more humorous beginnings to become more of a historian with a very good writing style. This book, while there are very funny bits, is more historical novel told by a professor we would all have loved to have had in school. Mr. Bryson gives us little known facts wrapped up with humorous anecdotes that help to cement the information.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book immensely and hope you do too.

B00C2C637I|2.0|I never read anything by Ray Bradbury and was curious about all the hype.  After this, I'll never waste time on anything else by him.  The description of the events didn't make any sense.  I couldn't tell what exactly was happening.  I got no overall &#34;message&#34; from this book either.  It was a waste of time.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I've just started reading the classics in sci-fi... this in particular to read before the movie comes out.  It was very engaging.  Although written from the perspective of a child, this book delves deeply into the human condition, explores complex ideas and novel physics with a good deal of insight, and finishes strong at the end.  Its a fairly quick read, I finished it in two nights.  I think you'll like it, and I'm looking forward to catching the movie.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|I have seen every other Star Trek series but never the original series. I always viewed it as being pretty cheesy. Yes, it is sometimes cheesy, sexist and xenophobic, but it also has surprising moments of clarity and promotes diversity. Even by today's standards, some things portrayed on the show are pretty advanced (for example, Kirk's superior is a man of color) and I applaud that. There is also some pretty awesome sci-fi! Certain episodes are very impressive for how original they are. I am now a fan of the original series!
0930289234|5.0|Despite being one of the most revered graphic novels of all time, it never really entered the mainstream of popular culture until the recent release of the movie.  Now, I find that people are rushing to read it in droves (despite the disappointing film version) and I couldn't be happier.
B00ELOOYZI|5.0|I installed this due to the bizarre coincidence that coworkers and I were discussing Kerbal yesterday and what could be learned from it.  I was incredibly shocked to see that this was available and made direct mention of Kerbal.  I've since tried it out, and while I'm no rocket scientist, it does appear to do a great job of maintaining simple physics in regard to thrust and direction vectors. I can safely say that I will probably be spending quite a bit of time with it to become familiarized enough to \\"feel comfortable\\" and then more than likely move on to Kerbal.  For the time being, I think this is a great app and consider myself very lucky to have gotten it for free as the AOD!!<br /><br />Lots of trial and error ahead as I forge my way into the darkness of space!! :)
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This outstanding mini-series produced by HBO Films, is based on the Nobel Prize Winning book \\"John Adams\\" by David McCullough.  Actor Paul Giamati won an emmy award for his role as John Adams, the 2nd President of the United States.  Actress Laura Linney portrays Adam's wife Abigail Adams and does an outstanding job as well.  The mini sereis begins in Boston on the eve of the American Revolution where Adams is defending the British Soldiers involved in the \\"Boston Massacre\\".  Adams successfully defended the soldiers and is hailed by the British Governor who wants him to hold a higher office for \\"His Majesty's\\" Government.  Adams decides that he will not accept the job and realizes that America needs to be independent from Great Britain.  The series then goes into Adams meeting Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, and many other founding fathers and it is a riveting story.  Throughout the series you see Adams become Ambassader to France and Great Britain, dissolve his friendship with Thomas Jefferson, become the United States 2nd President, and also care for his family where there is plenty of tragedy.  Laura Linney portrays Abigail Adams who truly is John Adams partner in life.  She is spirited, devoted, loving, and critical of her husband.  The series spans more than 50 years, and every part of the series is fascinating and outstanding.  This series received many emmys for \\"Best Mini Series\\", \\"Best Actor\\", \\"Best Actress\\" and many more deservedly so.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this excellent series for anyone who is interested in Colonial American History, early United States History, and just great acting overall!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

B00DJZR4A2|4.0|This review is written with only one listening under the belt. This album was advertised as a return to Elton John's roots. Having read that, I expected something along the lines of Madman Across the Water or Tumbleweed Connection. Not so much. The album consists of a solid lineup of adult-level music, including a mix of interludes. Nothing disappoints but nothing really grabs the listener. Having said that, I really do expect the music to grow on me after more exposure. After all, its hard not to like Elton John's music.

The deluxe edition has 2 more songs, a great booklet into a jewel case, save your money and buy the deluxe edition.

B00B7NPRY8|5.0|This book is one of the SciFi greats. I read it when I was a kid and was impacted by more vivid imagery in this book than any other I have read. All the best books create a \\"universe\\" so engaging that one buys into it all the way. The menace and the various factions and how they interweave, conflict and resolve is intricate and gripping. It is a grand vision and beautifully done.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|\\"This review was first posted on Kids Corner @ Kindle Nation Daily.\\"<br />Review written by: Thomas Busch  13 yrs old.<br /><br />Sadie and Carter Kane have always been able to do strange things that were unexplainable, birthday cakes exploding, and even glass cracking for no apparent reason, but then after witnessing their father's burial in a magical golden coffin, Sadie and Carter Kane stumble upon a world infested with Egyptian Gods and magic. While discovering they came from a long line of magical ancestors that goes back all the way to the time of the pharaohs in ancient Egypt, they team up with a goddess  and their uncle to rescue their father and save the world from another power crazy god that goes by the name of Set. The feat seems impossible considering they have had barely any magical training. Is everything really as it seems?  It is a race against time and a clan of magicians called the House of Life that is trying to eliminate them. Can they save the world? Find out in The Red Pyramid.  I personally like this book because the author narrated the story by using first person narrators. He made me feel as if I was watching what was happening instead of just reading it. This is the kind of book that you would want to never stop reading, and read it over and over again.<br /><br />Entertainment value,<br />This book is very entertaining; action packed with twists around every corner and a shocker at the end.<br /><br />Educational value,<br />The Red Pyramid is good if you are looking for an easy way to explain the Egyptian culture, to children.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am addicted to Candy Crush! My field of work exposes me to stress and anxiety. This game is my outlet when I have my alone time. Although I am a newbie and on level 49 I'm in no rush and spend 2-3 weeks on the challenging levels. This game is a great stress reliever for me!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this is a very addicting game but well worth download. this is a love- hate relationship with this game. have fun!
B0014BY72Q|4.0|Hokey but fun old movie.  Interesting premis of dystopian world that's the current fad in other movies, TV and books.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|It was fun to see how the found items had to be used and when.  I had to use the hints a few times but, only when I really couldn't remember where the items needed to be placed.  The graphics were great and I will reset the game and play again.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|While the game is fun-why does it keep timing out?  My game and I am blocked out of playing whenever I want?!?  Not very entertaining when it shuts down.
B00F8OUBXE|5.0|It seems that taking the last couple years off (which I feared was permanent) really did Metal Church some good. This is the most consistent album in quite some time. There's not a single dull track to be found and the songs maintain that perfect balance of thrash and heavy metal that those early Metal Church albums did so well. Ronny Munroe's vocals are at their best sounding very similar to David Wayne and there's many high notes to be found.<br /><br />I haven't been able to stop listening since I got my copy. Generation Nothing is right up there with the self-titled, The Dark, Blessing in Disguise, and David Wayne's Metal Church album. Any fan of those albums needs to get this one!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I read this a few years back when I was the Librarian at a middle school and let me tell you it still is awe-inspiring. Each one of the characters plays a fantastic role in forming the storyline and keeping you interested beyond the end of the book. I am on the second book of the quintet and am already hooked. If you like books that question the moral dilemmas of a society then this is a great choice.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It was amazing but sad. A wonderful story of life, love, dying, and everything in between. It is one of my favorites.
0316044695|2.0|An observation team, inserted without any good check on the terrain where they were going to work.  With camouflage including a big red New York Fire Department Memorial patch, and another guy sporting a flag of Texas.  The commumications equipment isn't capable of reaching any other member of the US Armed Services. In the 21st Century.<br /><br />And they get bumped.  Because they set up camp where the local guys took their goats out for a meal each morning.<br /><br />And they take a VOTE !!  on whether they are the Waffen SS and should shoot the goatherds.<br />And they decide this vote on their own personal attitudes to something called the American liberal media...<br /><br />Once upon a time, a British special forces team found themselves on a ridge overlooking a village in the old 'North Yemen'.  They got spotted by an old lady herding goats. They shot her.<br /><br />Their heads were subsequently displayed on poles, and a British Cabinet Minister denied this had happened in the House of Commons.  That was misleading parliament.<br /><br />Are these clowns still employed by the US Marines (an organization which is highly regarded by UK forces for its ability to adapt?) Obviously not, they got killed.  Now who would have guessed that would happen?
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I absolutely love this game!! Ever since I got it I couldn't stop playing it. It's absolutely amazing and I recommend this game for all ages. I hope y'all get this game because seriously it's a ton of fun!!!!

0316055433|5.0|Donna Tartt has managed to do something rather wonderful and the mechanism is mysterious. I had been definitely absorbed in the book, in a satisfying page turning sort of way; then there came a point when I fell inside the spell of the book - its world becoming real and textured.<br /><br />At one and the same time I was eager to be making the continuing journey of narrative , and yet - I wanted to stay exactly where I was and savour the moment, the reality of where the characters were NOW - she had somehow stopped time for me and I was reading in a very present way, inside the world<br /><br />Tartt managed exactly this trick with her first book The Secret History, creating something special and magical. Her second long awaited book, The Little Friend, was a huge damp squib, for this reader, her sharp intelligence and precision somehow soft: it irritated me, I disliked it.<br /><br />But here she is again, and this one is fabulous. Set across America, primarily in New York, but also in the wide-open spaces of Nevada, in the hinterland of Las Vegas, the book opens in Amsterdam, the central character a man somehow on the run, hyped up, holed up, hiding in a hotel room, sweating, edgy, on the edge of panic. The trajectory of the book is to start him on his journey to reach that anxious opening, and then go beyond<br /><br />The book is like a large 5 act play - and in some ways reminds me, in its structure, of Shakespeare's last plays, the ones that move beyond tragedy to redemption and understanding - Winter's Tale, The Tempest etc. We have a journey for the central character of the dreadful, lacking - not so much self-awareness as the discipline to manage his character flaws, a certain feckless, dark, damaged nature - and the journey is really to a better accommodation with self. Not the Hollywood journey, the, `make it all better tie the bows and open the box of chocolates journey, but the more bitter, more mature journey of better understanding, and ability to live within the flawed self, and within a flawed world.<br /><br />I am surprised at all the references to Dickens, how like Dickens this was - for me, this connection was not there at all - where I saw Tartt inhabiting some nineteenth century place it was the Russians - and particularly Dostoeivsky.<br /><br />Theodore Decker inhabits a dark, despairing nihilistic universe, which may not take him into such wrongdoing as Raskolnikov, but he does have extremely flexible attitudes to right and wrong - that is, not so much to how wrongdoing damages him, merely that he is not quite able to avoid making poor choices. He combines despair with a fervid appreciation of the value of art and beauty, and transcendence. Some very complex, layered depth of character.<br /><br />Though there is of course a story, as we know from the start, connected with the mysterious Dutch painting of a goldfinch, this is not primarily the story of the painting - there is indeed a strong narrative, a very strong sense of time and place, but what Tartt is doing is exploring the complexity of character and also of ethics.<br /><br />Her writing is beautiful, measured and potent. I particularly appreciated the change landscapes and times imposed on her language in the different sections, moving from a beautiful evocation of wintery Amsterdam, to the vibrant nature of New York (separated by a passage of time, two `acts' here) and the weird, frenetic Las Vegas excess and waste setting, before returning to the start, and travelling beyond, now we understand Theo's journey<br /><br />And, running like a lest-we-forget throughout, the reminder of the potent Goldfinch painting, which is both a real object, and a deeply charged, talismanic, symbolic item.<br /><br />Here is an extract, with a flavour of her writing - gorgeous, evocative - and deadly<br /><br />\\"Sometimes, in the evenings, a damp, gritty wind blew in the windows from Park Avenue, just as the rush hour traffic was thinning and the city was emptying for the night; it was rainy, trees leafing out, spring deepening into summer; and the forlorn cries of horns on the street, the dank smell of the wet pavement had an electricity about it, a sense of crowds and static, lonely secretaries and fat guys with bags of carry-out, everywhere the ungainly sadness of creatures pushing and struggling to live\\"<br /><br />That paragraph, started, for me, to play, strongly, Gershwin's Rhapsody In Blue, and just as I was comfortably in the blue melancholy, Tartt, as so often, delivered a harsh punch to the gut. She shows you beauty, and immediately nestles you up against the flip side of rot, despair, decay.<br /><br />So, having stunned and grabbed this reader with that first book, this magical third has been waiting 20 years to grab me again with its mix of dark and light. Hope It doesn't take her another 20 to produce something this fine!<br /><br />And I am properly envious of anyone about to start reading this; enjoy the catch of Tartt's carefully crafted spiders' web novel, hover round the edges as long as you can, I'm sure she will stickily, skilfully wind you in and tie you up tight ere long.ptying for the night; it was rainy, trees leafing out, spring deepening into summer; and the forlorn cries of horns on the street, the dank smell of the wet pavement had an electricity about it, a sense of crowds and static, lonely secretaries and fat guys with bags of carry-out, everywhere the ungainly sadness of creatures pushing and struggling to live\\"<br /><br />That paragraph, started, for me, to play, strongly, Gershwin's Rhapsody In Blue, and just as I was comfortably in the blue melancholy, Tartt, as so often, delivered a harsh punch to the gut.

B005PK57IK|5.0|It just gets better and better! I'm so hooked, I'll be in Good Wife withdrawal when I finish all the seasons...
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|A very fun game. The story of the game makes you think just as much as the puzzles. I recommend this game to anyone who loves interactive puzzle games.
B008ROG6E0|4.0|Made back in the early 70's, this movie still has some replay value.I enjoy the them and plot.  The characters of Logan and Jennifer play out nice.  Not your modern day special effects, but top of the line in its day.  Get pass the special effects still a good movie to watch.
1401923127|5.0|Fascinating read but requires a bit of scientific literacy like  8th grade level that unfortunately most Americans do not have. But absolutely a must buy for everyone, especially phd scientists as well as doctors who do laboratory research.
B00FWLSOOG|5.0|This movie is not for those looking for something &#34;Hi brow.&#34;  It is big robots fighting over-sized, Godziila-like dinosaurs.  However, it is great entertainment and has some impressive special effects.  I'm a Godzilla/Big Monster fan, so if you are one also, this film is really for you.  If you just like action/adventure or science fiction, I think you'll get a kick out of it as well.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been waiting for this moment for a long time! This is really fun, and I knew this game would be fun. But I didn't know why it came out this time. Like Pet Rescue Saga was supposed to come out today. I saw it on the TV this morning, and the woman said, &quot;This game will be on Androids, iPads, and iPods&quot;. So I quickly went on my Kindle Fire because it's an Android. Then I went to the Shop Icon, and I didn't see the Pet Rescue Game. And I was so disappointed. ;c But it will come out.
B000GT7XXW|5.0|This is my favorite Shakespeare-into-film.  The actors are the very best, the setting is so beautiful, the costumes are amazing. Bravo, Kenneth Branagh - you are a perfect Hamlet against whom others will be judged.
B00F9040HU|2.0|I read the remarks about too brief free game but thought I would give it a try and see for myself.  I wish I had not bothered.  I only played a few games when told had to purchase game to continue.  So I deleted.  Now it is cluttering up my cloud.  Makes me cautious about other games by this provider.<br />!
B00B8R1NP0|4.0|Started off great and sucked me right in.<br /><br />The story is a good one, and the scenes are gruesome enough, yet still leave enough to the imagination.<br /><br />The ending was rather predictable and some of the dialogue wasn't the best, but overall I really liked it.
B0093Q8W0C|5.0|It is still one of the best movies of all time. Having it available on Amazon makes it a joy to watch again and again.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|Love all of their music!  I never get tired of listening to it.  Love each and every song on this CD.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The author does a fantastic job of bringing an old \\"falling for a knight in shining armor\\" to a modern, can't get enough, yearning for more, romantic yet elusive relationship..very well written..
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Brilliantly conceived, produced and acted, \\"Larkrise to Candleford\\" gives us a glimpse into a simpler time ... to a place we would like to spend an afternoon ... or a lifetime!

B00F0O8SZK|5.0|I was expecting this newest CD by Susan to be good, even great but I did not expect such sublime beauty on every single track. Susan has honed her instrument to perfection. I LOVED last years' release, Standing Ovation and didn't think it could get better than that . . . but it does. My favorite? The Christmas Waltz. I'd never heard the song before and now it's a Christmas favorite. I can't stop listening to it. Susan's vocal are gorgeous. Another favorite is the hauntingly beautiful In the Bleak Midwinter. My midwinter won't be bleak listening to it over and over. What an inspired idea to add bagpipes to the Little Drummer Boy. Fantastic. The three classics, The Christmas Song, Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas and I'll be Home for Christmas are all now officially &#34;owned&#34; by Susan Boyle. Her vocals on these are a throwback to the 40's; sultry, dreamy, haunting. The two duets are beautiful. When a Child Born with Johnny Mathis is superlative, truly gorgeous. O' Come, All Ye Faithful with Elvis is a marvel of modern technology. Two of the most gorgeous voices beautifully melded. The Lord's prayer is sung like a long drawn out prayer. I don't believe there's another singer out there who can hold and caress a note as beautifully as Susan Boyle. Loosely paraphrasing St. Augustine, &#34;He who sings, prays twice.&#34; Susan does that magnificently with the Lord's Prayer. Hark the Herald Angel's Sing is sung just like I like to hear it at Midnight Mass. Susan, choir and orchestration sound perfect together. The last song on the CD, the &#34;Miracle Hymn&#34; was  written specifically for Susan to sing in the upcoming movie, the Christmas Candle. It's a beautiful neo-classical hymn that I hope is played over and over every Christmas. It's gorgeous.
B00CW7KK9K|3.0|The Withings Pulse is an ok product, but there are better choices.  As a heart rate monitor, it doesn't continually monitor, you have to press a button.  Since it's a bit hard to read when in it's little wristband, you probably have to stop running, biking, etc. to read your pulse (which of course changes your pulse).  The wristband is inferior to making this as an integrated wristwatch.  You can get a heart rate monitor as an integral part of an actual wristwatch for less.  If you are wanting more, and willing to spend more, the Garmin Forerunner 110 GPS-Enabled Sport Watch with Heart Rate Monitor is currently listed at $176.95.  This does MUCH more (GPS!), is of much better quality, is easier to use on the fly.  Just a much better choice and, though more expensive, is still a better buy overall.  The Pulse is more of a plaything than a serious fitness tool.
B00FFHG6KQ|5.0|This is my new favorite game! It was a little difficult @ 1st, I've found the 1touch mode is easier for me to play, I even won a few games! ;-) The graphics are unbelievable! Well worth the money, (although, I'm g glad I caught it for half price!) If you love basketball as much as I do, you love this game! Can't wait to get to the playoffs/finals! Love it!!!
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|I love Suits--its a show about intelligent people being intelligent. In a world of reality TV, its nice that there is still some guilty pleasures that don't leave you with an IQ drop.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|This is a load of crap..theres nothing on here that my TV or my bluray or my xbox doesnt already have...how bout you get some apps to make this worth a buy like HBOGO...really..jeez
B009SJ3H8Q|4.0|Fantastic acting and a compelling story line drive this terrifying series. The overall feel is classic horror... be careful watching before bed!
B00AEBBA36|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS REALLY GOOD, BUT SOME PARTS HARD TO WATCH.  IT'S WAR, NOT MUCH HAPPINESS THERE, IT'S SAD BUT VERY WELL MADE AND GOOD ACTING. PROBABLY RANKS IN ONE OF THE BEST WAR MOVIES MADE.
B0058UXHHK|4.0|I loved Rose - she was a great character and so full of life... even if she did get started a bit late due to an overbearing mother.  Enjoyed the self-deprecating humour and watching her go through her simple but rather poignant list.  I also loved her dog!  Her personal story - including the visions - are all believable and easy to relate to.  We can all see a little bit of ourselves in Rose.<br /><br />I have downloaded book #2 so am hoping it's just as good!<br /><br />SERIOUS SPOILER ALERT<br />I gave it a 4 - or 4 1/2 - not a 5 because I am not quite sure I found the mystery aspect entirely believable... it was too simple and no real explanation as to why her mother was killed instead of her (it's hard to mistake an old woman for a young girl) or how Sloan got mixed up in it - was he in fact a cop or a bad guy? What was his relationship to Joe?  And was Betty the intended target all along and if so, what use is there in killing Rose?
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game is by far one of the best games ive ever played on a mobile device, however, the game crashes everytime I attempt to connect to Facebook which sucks considering those would be useful real gold. But still an amazing game!!!
B004EBZX6W|2.0|It doesn't really do anything you can't find in built in icons for battery and WiFi signal.  I have already deleted it.
0545615402|5.0|These were a gift for my significant other and we were both impressed with the quality. If any Harry Potter fan doesn't have this library then this will make a great gift. The case is sturdy, the cover print is elaborate, and the pages are a pleasant thickness. The illustrations are always fun.<br /><br />And getting all three at this price can't be beat.
006202406X|4.0|I will agree that the writing of the book was a little lacking compared to the first two books. However, what I loved about this book is that it was different. It deviated from some of the norms of YA fiction and took the reader by surprise. I could discuss the writing or the plot structure, character development or the believability of certain aspects. However, the simple fact that I was taken back by the ending is enough for now.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Not really a game for the little kids. It is a fast-paced game that requires quick reflexes. Good game overall and pretty good graphics.
B00EXVZW6E|1.0|Downloaded this application but when I tried to play it, meaning load it, it starts and then it goes to a logo and name, I assume the developer and then jumps out.  Ugh!
B0093ST02E|3.0|It was a pretty good movie - slow moving.  Characters were interesting -- it was okay - not what I expected.
0743497465|3.0|Deception Point is a well written book good for people looking for a quick techno-thriller book but it does not compare to some of Dan Brown's other books. Like all of Brown's books, Deception Point has a strong male and female protagonist that inevitably start a romantic relationship with each other but this relationship was rushed. There was absolutely no romantic development yet the two of them risk their lives for each other like they were meant to be. At the end of the book, Rachel and Micheal start procreating in the White House. That is fine and dandy especially in current society where one night stands are a norm, but the two of them went from just being introduced to declaring their \\"love\\" for each other and having sex within a day or two.<br /> Inadvertently, not only is the romance unbelievable but so is the plot. The action scenes in the book were too exaggerated and implausible. The idea that NASA finding signs of extraterrestrial life would be able to turn the tables of a presidential campaign is laughable, but nevertheless, the plot was intriguing. Maybe I read one too many of Brown's books but the plot was simply too predictable. Brown always explains and introduces important things in too much detail and that is a dead giveaway to the identity of the main antagonist such as when Rachel was introducing the expander cycle engines.<br />  He also always introduces \\"fake\\" antagonists to try to throw us off such as Marjorie Trench while the real one is usually the one good idea you would never expect. Trench was the stereotypical Machiavellian politician and with the evidence piling up, she seemed to be the one to blame until she was killed in a bomb explosion.  William Pickering, on the other hand, seemed like Rachel's trusted boss and nothing more, but was actually the mastermind behind everything. Similarly, in Digital Fortress, the main female protagonist's boss was the antagonist. Brown's plotlines are very similar to each other and that does make it a bit boring.<br />  In conclusion, Deception Point is a well written book full of betrayal, military might, and intrigue but it is also full of impossibilities. I enjoyed the book but there were many chapters where I was skeptical of the plot. This was the only book out of Brown's works that I did not read before and in my honest opinion, the worst. Brown's second to last work, The Last Symbol, was a book that I could not put down. After getting it, I pulled an all-nighter to finish it. Deception Point just did not compare.t a bit boring.<br />  In conclusion, Deception Point is a well written book full of betrayal, military might, and intrigue but it is also full of impossibilities.

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is so addicting I can't seem to put it down. I tried the trial version of it and loved it so much that I had to buy it. Great game for addicting fun.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Great sound quality, definitely worth the price. I previously owned Bose Headphones, but I kept having to buy new cables because they would wear out and eventually gave up spending $20 every three months. No such problems with the Sony cable, which is INSANELY long.<br /> I will say if you want really high volume these are not the headphones for you.
B004LUS390|5.0|very powerful and useful, lots of options, if you like drawing on tablet this is one of your best options around!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Fantastic book, it definitely makes you think about what's important in your life. It provides an interesting perspective as well.
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|Great fun for the kids, I really like the music and the variety of the characters in the game. A little bit more difficult than the original, but fun.
044024367X|4.0|Good story line and suspense enough to keep you up late at night.  Lee Child has developed quite an exciting character
B0015RRN8O|1.0|I received two copies of the 1968 version of this DVD and the company refuses to make good and allow me to exchange one of the '68 versions for the newer remake.  Although I've done business with Amazon for many years this experience has been frustrating... it's not about the money, rather I did not get what I paid for.
B00AG472DS|5.0|............which complain about the ending being somewhat anti-climactic. I mean, you do realize Zodiac was never caught, right ?<br /><br />Great \\"old school\\" type movie, with Dialog and acting taking precedence over CGI and silly gun battles.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome and entertaining and very adventurous I love it!! So many cool uniforms and people to race with I'm active most of the time
B004I2K4E8|5.0|My husband and I love this movie and the music. When we thought it was over, lo and behold, all the wonderful casts from the previous shows appeared and continued singing. It was WONDERFU!!!
B0084670FU|4.0|Ive seen this movie several times and each time I saw it differently.  Brad Pitt can change his persona for each role and more than that I believe this movie could happen anytime anywhere.
B0033KR5YS|3.0|The review above is very helpful in many aspects, but I still do not agree with the worth of this set. The performances here are admittedly first class. Half of them are the only recordings of those operas and the first issues of the individual operas are all out of print...<br /><br />In these circumstances the lack of librettos is doubly frustrating. There are also no cued synopsises (a single sentence for each track summarizing the action).  As if that is not enough, the synopsis for each opera is ONE PARAGRAPH and is NOT act by act!<br /><br />This is the least inclusive cd set I have acquired so far (save for a Sibelius Symphonies by N. Jarvi set on DG containing a single sheet for information!) For a set containing such a rare repertoire without available alternatives, the producers should have been much more sensitive. Purchasing the mp3 tracks instead would be literally the same as buying the physical product. Shame...
B004ZY0VHY|4.0|The intensity and emotion of a parent's quest to understand &#34;why?&#34; are prevalent throughout. Some of the reading can feel quite tedious as the pretentious and somewhat unsympathetic main character expresses her thoughts. However, as the story progresses one comes to realize that this pretentiousness is an important part of the story. This book tackles a difficult subject and comes the closest to capturing the true emotions that people in this circumstance must feel of anything I have read.
B00BRUPICM|5.0|Very exciting, surprising and well written. I didn't want it to end. Will definitely be searching out more books by this author!
B008V8FVTI|5.0|I'm not sure I was prepared for this movie.  It pulled the ground out from under any naivete left in my psyche.  I've worked in Social Services as a counselor and had heard of such stories, but I thought they were surely being brought to justice by now.<br /><br />I have no doubt that this goes on around the US in the form of privatized prisons, mental institutions, and other institutions where there is no continuous oversight; within churches and religious organizations with their vulnerable youth; anywhere where sick minds are in positions of power.  And I am so sad for us.  How can our country heal with such sick minds in charge of the most vulnerable of our citizens?<br /><br />I'm happy I saw this film.  It is very well made on a topic that most people will not be able to believe is true.  I believe it is time for us all to let go of our naivete, roll up our sleeves and get busy protecting our vulnerable, and help with the healing process to the best of our abilities.  Sleepers was hard to see but worth every moment.
B00FH3Z91A|5.0|I have had the note 2 for a year and fell in love with these wallet cases.  But this time with the note 3 I found that the same company did not make one.  Forcing me to try this company out.  Well its a great case.  Way smaller than anythoers I have had.  Also the sleeve part acts like a screen protector.  The problem with other styles that have the sleeve under the cards is if u have a lot of stuff the pressure put on the stitching will rub a line in ur screen unless you have a great screen protector.  This style removes that problem and need.  You will be happy with this.  Only down side is the sleeve is not big enough for cash no matter how u put it in.  U have to fold it a few times to make it fit.  Worth the pain.  Highly recommend.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun and takes the mind off other things,if you haven't tried maybe you should its a fun part of the day
B00CIFK316|4.0|Is my review really an essential contribution for this collection? Doubtful. But since Amazon asked me to write one, here it is: this book is, as you likely already know, engaging, well-written, filled with interesting characterization and quippery, and just plain a pleasure to read. Dive in. You'll be glad you did.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this addicting game! Even though I'm only on level 87, my only request is that they offer unlimited lives*
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Good book few shocking parts but good<br />I enjoyed it kinda wished it ended differently though but I'd recommend this
B005MLOKXA|4.0|.Enjoyable, entertaining series with good character acting by the main protagonists. Some of the plots tend to get a bit off the track if you are a wannabe lawyer, but all in all, I found the series a good way to lose an hour or so before going to bed.
B00ELOOYZI|5.0|I'm so glad I got this as the app of the day, but it's totally worth the money and I highly recommend it! It's a blast (no pun intended)! The tutorial and ease the developer has implemented makes it easy enough and very fun to get addicted.<br /><br />I get bored very easy with mobile games and this keeps you on your feet. It's not a matter of repetition, but the correct recipe to achieve the goals! It's also just fun to build a big rocket and<br />blow it to bits!
B0058DRUV6|5.0|This book is compellingly written. It's on point for me as a third-year businessperson. I was enthralled with the deep business truths flowing through it. I learned new things while feeling validated in much that I've already been doing.  Any sincere business owner or student of business should read this book.

B005544V6A|4.0|It's great, it makes me think that not all lawyers are completely terrible people :) she's shoes did a s
B00EE3FVSU|3.0|Well done, but predictable.  The acting is superior, story line is not; but there are limits to this genre, which make it inane.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|We've been hooked in the &#34;Walking Dead&#34; since watching the first episode aired! Our only complaint is how long it takes between seasons!
B00ELE8D4Q|5.0|Every song on the CD is amazing! Cher gets better with age!  I highly recommend it! Her voice gives me goosebumps!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this app it's very Addictive!!! I can't stop playing I even got my husband & daughter hooked! This is a great game the whole family will enjoy, I definitely recommend it!!!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I agree with a lot of what the other low rating reviewers have already said. I was SO excited to read this book but, unfortunately, I was SO disappointed. It was just so middle of the road, not horrible but it certainly didn't live up to my expectations.
1423136802|5.0|He devoured the first book, and we found the second somewhere.  He was getting through it pretty fast, so I went ahead and bought this set.
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|What can I say about Dream Theater? They are constantly creating a new sound with each new album. Since the line-up change, DT has taken on a whole new dimension. Dream Theater is just a great album. Although their music is probably appreciated more by musicians than not, this album is certainly something everyone can get something out of. I just love every song on this album and I can't wait to see them in concert on the tour supporting this new release. If you like Rush, or progressive rock in general, this album is for you.
B00EY7LT9Q|5.0|This show has a comic book feel. Coulson and May are awesome! Characters are witty and engaging. I look forward to each new episode!
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|fun, practice will make perfect, maybe it will improve my hunting techniques. i would recommend this game to my friends
B00CATSONE|5.0|Edison who?  Even though he was a bit odd, I can only imagine what he would be capable of it he were to be alive today.  Good free book!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so happy we can now play on our kindles, works great. Should have been available a long time ago.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|A classic, one of the best films ever made.  The film reflected the world's political state in 1941 despite many of the obvious flaws in the context of the story.  Bogart, Bergman, Raines, ( Lorre, briefly ) plus numerous character actors seen in many other films, Sidney Greenstreet being the most prominent.  A film you can watch over and over and never tire of.
B005OCFGTO|1.0|All 8 of these DVDs were flawed in some way. Very disappointing, especially since they were a gift to my daughter.<br /> Will be returning them....
B00121QGUY|5.0|This is a classic movie that we love and have watched so many times.  We are so excited to have it on Blueray!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love the story line and the characters.  I hope the series goes on for many years. It's nice to have a series that is not about the USA ... love the English background.
B00F91RYL8|1.0|This is one of the worst zombie movies I have ever seen and the action was boring, I did not even finish it.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|What Card has done is what I thought to be impossible. Bridging the gap of 3000 years is no small task, yet his writing seamlessly takes Ender Wiggin from destroyer of worlds to the creator of harmony a long lost Earth could only dream of. Once the story moved past the needed history and background, I couldn't put this book down. I can't wait to crack into the next installment!
1878424319|5.0|Great book, lots of interesting, thought provoking subjects. I would definitely recommend this to anyone that is looking for a different way to look at things
B008Q08EG8|5.0|Jimmy Stewart and John Wayne portraying young men was a little incredible - probably why it was filmed in black-and-white.  Great story, though, and the performances are rock-solid throughout.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|Reminded me of the older Sci-Fi I used to read in short stories years ago. Well done movie, good actors.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I got the app because people were talking about how great it was. I like the game but lose lives easily. I don't buy &quot;lives&quot; EVER for ANY game... so this app is good for about 15 minutes.. then I have to quit and do something else... pretty soon I will get bored and delete the app... stuff happens.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Bought the set because I wanted to start showing my daughter the great movies that I grew up on. She loves them and it was a great experience for her. Brought back great memories for me too.
B003TTH4IU|5.0|Fantastic show!! I am hooked! I love watching every episode and I can't wait to watch the next one! AWESOME!
B008SOS63S|4.0|Compelling personal story told in a manner that allows the reader to experience every step. Readers will experience Mark's recovery every step of the way
B00005ATZT|5.0|Harrison Ford will always be best remembered for Han Solo and Indiana Jones but this performance as Dr. Richard Kimble can stand up with those giants. Ford gives his all as the convicted murder on the run to prove his innocence, as does Tommy Lee Jones in his Oscar winning role as the US Marshal hunting him down. You'll find yourself rooting for both characters, even though their goals are in conflict. It's perfectly paced and masterfully shot and stands as one of the best executed thrillers of the 1990s.
B005XUC398|3.0|This movie had a great group of actors that seemed to do a good job, but the story just wasn't very strong.
B0053O8ARI|4.0|Hilarious, Kat Dennings is everything. This show is everything. Word. Love how vulgar it is, haters be hating but this show is what's up.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  The two main characters were interesting and you wanted to know more about them while hoping all turned out well for them.  Also liked that the story was told in two time periods. So different and yet quite the same.  I'd recommend this to everyone looking for a really good story.
B00B1MHXY2|4.0|This is one of those albums that everybody knows at least one song from. But to truly appreciate it you have to hear the whole thing. The flow of one song to the next is carefully planned out and they're all very well done.
B005C0DHEY|4.0|This is a really good movie to watch to be aware of the consequences of fracking.  It makes you sick to your stomach to think about how these people are being taken advantage of.
B000RLFJQ2|3.0|This movie was not terribly original as it used themes that have been overused in the past. The acting was mediocre.
B00BSBVJVE|5.0|\\"I Am Pusheen the Cat\\" contains the adorable illustrations of Pusheen living her life, as an every-cat. If you're not familiar with Pusheen, she is a grey tabby cat whose name translates from Irish Gaelic to \\"kitten\\". She has a zest for adventure and an equal love of food.<br /><br />Many of the stories and comics, featuring Pusheen and occasionally her sister Stormy, are comics that long-time Pusheen fans will no doubt recount with joy for the second (or third, or fourth...) time. Newcomers to Pusheen will undoubtedly be enchanted with her all the same from the collection in this book.<br /><br />The quality of the book itself is superb, and the pricing is on par as such. \\"I Am Pusheen the Cat\\" is a fantastic book to share with all ages. This book is perfectly Pusheen.
B001QB5S3G|5.0|Great movie !  Soul stirring and powerful!  Highly recommend.  Will actually speak into your self-unforgiveness if there is any in you.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell has the gift of articulating truths that are so simple, they are hidden in plain sight.<br />And as usual, you don't only learn the what but also the why. David and Goliath is a great read; it challenges our perceptions of advantages and disadvantages...and no matter your predisposition, you are compelled to take a second look.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Simply put, the Chromecast is fantastic. For the price, especially if you got in when they had the Netflix deal, this was almost impossible to pass up. Now, I'm a bit of a tech guy and have a computer plugged into every TV in my house, but this is still great for sharing YouTube and Netflix videos to the big screen without having to go switch inputs and grab my keyboard. I like the CEC support to turn on and change the input of your TV automatically the most.<br /><br />I can only give 4 stars out of 5 though because while the product is fantastic and the price is right, it still hasn't been adopted by many other apps than the initial few. Hulu recently added support, but Google has been fairly quiet about the product since announcing it. Still, even if you just used it for YouTube, Netflix, and/or Hulu, it's so cheap it's still a great buy. I'd really like to see Google use this technology more though and it would be worth a full 5 stars.<br /><br />For those comparing with Apple TV or Airplay, I don't see any reason for these products to co-exist as they do very similar tasks. The difference though is that using Airplay requires you to buy an Apple TV at minimum which is a good bit more expensive. Simply put though, if you're an Apple person with a lot of Apple products, you may be happier with an Apple TV using Airplay. Otherwise, this cheaper alternative can perform similarly if not even better once Google and other companies (hopefully) start to utilize it more.
B005LAII44|3.0|I agree with some of the other reviews here. I enjoyed the first film with all it's cheesy moments. Retaliation for me had some good action sequences and technology.  However it suffered from inconsistencies in the story line and no explanation for the other characters missing from the first film.  This one also lacked character development and don't even get me started on how short Tatum's screen time was. I hope if they make a third, they consider bringing back Duke and the other characters from the first film.
0767817729|3.0|This was a good story, but with lots of violence which we see too much of already. Good acting by all stars and story kept you on edge at all times.
0385338082|4.0|I got this at the library because I enjoyed several others of Kinsella's novels (I've Got Your Number, Confessions of a Shopaholic/Shopaholic Takes Manhattan, and am currently reading Twenties Girl) and this is definitely one of my favorite books I've ever read.<br />However, I was very disappointed with the ending. It felt very rushed. I think -SPOILER ALERT- Jack shouldn't have gone back to Emma like that, it was too fast. I think Emma should have gone back to her flat and been all sad and lonely and hating Jemima for a week or so and then Jack would realize he was being unfair and he should've believed Emma, and THEN he should have gone back to her. Not an hour after he stormed out dramatically. It just felt like lazy writing to have him leave like that and then toss him back in at the last moment, with little explanation of why he forgave her.<br /><br />However, despite the dull ending, I really really loved this book and I'm going to buy my own copy ASAP! Definitely one of Kinsella's best novels yet.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I tried other similar apps but not satisfied. I tried Evernote and I LOVE it. Very easy to use. Very easy to sync to all my devices. And all the extra features are a plus. You can't beat the price. TY Evernote!
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|This is an AWESOME game. To be completely honest, this is the main game that I play. It's cute, it's fun and highly addictive. It's a great that you can play all the time or just play it once in a while.<br /><br />I don't see the big deal about all the complaints about the required internet connection. It's really not worth all the fuss. The game works great on Kindle Fire and other android tablets. However, if you don't want to lose your progress with almost every update, you have to play via Facebook account. I don't know a lot about the IOS version (as I haven't played the IOS version in over a year) I do know that with the second to the last IOS update a friend of mine's game progress got completely wiped out, both in gamecenter and on the device itself. I have never had such problems via Facebook.<br /><br />I have also seen complaints about the game showing the loading page and when it was almost done loading it would close out saying that there was an error. This was true 2 maybe 3 updates ago. This problem has been fixed.<br /><br />As far as accidental in-app purchasing, it says right in the description that there is in- app purchasing and that there are parental control options. So, any accidental in- app purchases are not the game's fault but user error. Also, the game is only expensive if you are extremely impatient.<br /><br />As far as the newest update, it says in the help menu the magic resets in 24 hours from when you last played. It is also true that the shrines are pretty much useless now. It is also true that breeding 2 of the same specialty dragons (such as a moon dragon) no longer guarantees that you will get that dragon as it did before. However, this never worked with the limited time holiday dragons such as the bone and the reindeer dragon to begin with. This however doesn't really matter for newer players as they may not have known of this rule in the first place. Apart from that, the newest update is great.<br /><br />Overall, all the badreviews are either because of user error or a matter of preference. Though I must say, though in the beginning the game is highly addictive, the further in the game you are the game does tend to get a bit boring because there is less for you to do. However, that is just my opinion and I still consider the game fun even though I'm a lvl 46.<br /><br />Overall, great game! Highly recommend it!
6304711905|4.0|My husband wanted this DVD as it is one of his favorite movies about Wyatt Earp.  Good acting, fast-paced, and good story
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Best series ever written. I can't wait to see where the story goes next. Love how the story is told from many different angles.
B00CNQ7HAU|2.0|John Grisham tells a good story, and \\"Sycamore Row\\" is a good story. However, it is so populated with over the top characters, \\"factual\\" asides, and legal shenanigans that lack credibility that that story begs bogged down, and by the end, I didn't even care anymore.  Maybe there are attorneys in small southern towns that are disbarred practising alcoholics with wealthy bloodlines, obnoxious venal divorce attorneys like Harry Vox, and attorneys who are just flat out dirty players commit criminal, as well as unethical, acts to gain advantage in a case. Most improbable, because ex parte judicial contacts are almost uniformly prohibitted, is the relationship between Jake and Judge Atlee. Then there is the helpful sheriff. To have this all go on in one place in order to make this a good \\"story\\"  strained all crediblity for me. I am an attorney, and I live in Alaska, where part of this novel took place. His descriptions of Juneau, Alaska are good. However, I think it's time Grisham retired these characters and went back to telling good stories that at least are a little more credible.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|This show gets better and better. Just wish there were more episodes in a season.  Can't wait for season 4.
B000JMLFLW|1.0|This book comes highly recommended to me however I find it a little to long a lot to boring for me.
B00EKQ3YZI|3.0|I LOVE Donna Summer.  I grew up listening to her and have each and every one of her albums.  Yes, she has an incredible voice.  Yes, nothing will ever touch the originals.  You cannot top the original arrangements and orchestrations of MacArthur Park Suite, or her amazing voice on I Feel Love.<br /><br />But, so what?  That's NOT the point of this album.  It's a remix album.  It's not a club album, or a dance album, or a 90's house-party album.  A remix doesn't have to be anything specific; it's what the remixer wants it to be.  It's reimagining the song; redefining, reshaping, reinterpreting it.  Adding a thumping beat, or speeding it up is NOT the point.  That would be boring and predictable.  A good remix CHANGES the song, makes it unique and something that stands on its own.  So the fact that some of these are weird, or just fragments of the original is EXACTLY the point.  The \\"abysmal\\" remixes of On The Radio and Dim All The Lights do not obliterate the original from existence, so relax.<br /><br />That being said, I LOVE the remix of On The Radio on this album.  It's a weird, trippy, spaced-out ghost version of one of my favorite songs.  It doesn't replace the original, it doesn't even come close to touching the brilliance of the original.  But that doesn't mean it sucks.<br /><br />So open up your minds, dudes.  Let these remixes just BE.  Don't look for a \\"dancier\\" version of what are already amazing songs.  The fact that this album has tracks that explore NEW sounds for Donna Summer should be celebrated.  Do I love the album?  No.  Could it be better?  For me, yes it could.  It could be edgier, darker.  It could push the limits even further.  But it's tracks like On The Radio that represent the direction I would go on a second volume, should Verve decide to do another.  Speaking of which, here are the tracks that I would love to see make up volume two:<br /><br />1. The Wanderer<br />2. Take Me<br />3. Rumor Has It<br />4. Grand Illusion<br />5. With Your Love<br />6. Lucky<br />7. Heaven Knows<br />8. No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)<br />9. Nightlife<br /><br />Remixers that would be great to see include Seamus Haji, Fred Falke, Burns, MSTRKRFT, Scissor Sisters, Peaches, Riton, Goldfrapp, Kid Gloves and Morgan Page.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Fun game that allows you to build your own reef.. ability to choose from different corals, plants, and other decorations. Requires a little strategy.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game!! I wish we could buy chips with earned money. But I must say I do really enjoy the free tournaments and I have enjoyed this bingo game the best by far!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I'm not a big fan of Lawyers, or stories about them....however, this was excellent.  Very well written, well, it was Grisham, a very well known author, so it should have been.  I had no clue whether the hero, a disgraced, imprisoned lawyer, was going to come out on top or not.  A really good read.
B00E9ZFIMM|1.0|Apparently, the advertised features only exist in the advertising.<br /><br />Don't wast your time and bandwidth.  This app is just not worth it.
B004GYY714|4.0|Worked on other Kindles, just not on Kindle HDX. The app's UI functions for me, but the streams are choppy and go in and out. Pandora and Digitally Imported do not do this. I have tested on home network and at work and I get the same thing. This was my favorite radio app. Hopefully they will fix soon.<br /><br />I used Tune In for Years. Thankfully there was IHeartRadio which give me the local radio I need with my Kindle HDX. I installed and it works as advertised on my Kindle HDX. The one CON against IHeart;  Tune In still has maximum flexibility to find all the terrestrial and online stations. Something that IHeartRadio cannot do. I wish they'd fix TUNE in for Kindle HDX. Based other reviews TUNE In is in no hurry to do so. Too Bad.<br /><br />Update 11/06/2013:<br />They fixed it and all seems to be OK again. I guess I can uninstall IHeartRadio now.
B00DAXXO98|5.0|This is how Washington and congress really works.  I enjoyed watching the cut throat and divisive action throughout the whole series
0066620996|5.0|There are very few books in this genre that I think are worth the read. Good to Great is definitely one of the tops. It presents revolutionary theories in a narrative that is comprehensible and non-threatening. Jim Collins is a rare combination of brilliant researcher and effective story-teller, backing up his amazing anecdotes with reliable figures and methodologies. There aren't many must-read books out there, but in order to succeed at work at any level, Good to Great is a must-read.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Love this game but im ready for some new levels. I already have all the stars on all the levels. Does anyone in now when the update is com ing out
B003PIUBZS|3.0|I love this show. However, I detested it's bizarre nudity double standard. It's not just this show but Hollywood as a whole, But this show exemplified it perhaps better than any other piece of mainstream Hollywood entertainment.<br /><br />This show seemed to revel in showing the penis. Sometimes multiple times per episode. Sometimes whole chunks of dialogue would be shot in a wide shot so that the man's genitals would be in full view for almost the whole scene.<br /><br />Yet when it came to female nudity the viewer would always get merkins, meaning fake pubic hair to cover the vagina (technically the vulva). In fact most female nudity was just topless, but in the rare scene which featured full female nudity the woman would always be wearing a merkin. Usually one that looked laugh out loud funny. Why go out out your way to show ACTUAL male genitals yet censor it with the women.<br /><br />Now, some might say they were simply being historically accurate. After all, women had hair back then. But if historical accuracy was the goal then why were ALL THE MEN SHAVED? If it was OK for the man's pubic area to be historically wrong then why not the women? Moreover, many women in the show had breast implants. Thus using historical accuracy as an excuse for this bizarre nudity double standard just doesn't hold up.<br /><br />And while some of the male genitals featured in the show might have been prosthetics, most were not. It is just difficult to fathom that in the year 2013 we get a steady dose of clearly visible male genitals in mainstream entertainment, yet when it comes to women it is always censored. This show was consistently guilty of that. Just once can we get an adult show that features some female nudity as graphic as the male nudity? This double standard is really getting old.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|For all ponies and bronies, take it from me this game is worth it. All the most well known ponies are there not to mention all the updates keep it fresh and New
0062073508|5.0|Agatha Christie has to be one of my favorite writers. She fills her stories with suspense, and her books are page-turners. I have finished one of her books in one day. The way she deceives the readers is fantastic, especially in this novel. You may think you know who did it, and then a discovery is made which makes you question everything you had previously thought. Not only does Christie add this deception, she also includes some humor. If you like mystery books at all, I recommend this book. I think the storyline is ingenious; the 17 people are trapped on a train, and one of the passengers must be the murderer. 17 people are trapped on a train stuck in the snow. One of them is dead. Agatha Christie makes you suspect every single one of the 13 passengers which detective Hercule Poirot and his 2 investigators interview. Christie also gives you all the evidence you need to solve the crime: a map of compartments, even a schedule of the occurrences the night of the murder, all you need is a brain to think. In this story you feel like you are with Poirot, and you are there interviewing the passengers. Christie will keep you on your toes, trying to figure out the culprit. It is full of surprises I definitely did not see coming. I suggest that before reading the last chapter of the book you take a guess as to who committed the crime. You may be completely surprised. The dialogue in this novel has a flow just like natural conversation. Since it flows like this, sometimes it is hard to follow the characters or who said what, so pay very close attention. Because of the time period it was written, some of the dialogue is in French and I recommend anyone who does not know any French to translate these words because they are important in the story. So as long as attention is paid to the dialogue, the reader’s understanding of this book is a lot clearer. This book is a classic and I highly recommend reading it.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love my little pony Applejack is awesome. Anyone that likes them should play this game. I hope to get all the ponies one day. Have fun playing with all of you favorite ponies
B00CLMA3HK|4.0|And it's a ride in every way imaginable. Planes, spaceships, time travel, and adventure after spine tingling adventure. This is National Treasure, Indiana Jones, My Favorite Martian and Stargate all rolled up into one.<br /><br />Aurora Conspiracy: The Story Didn't End with a Crash, is action packed and fast paced from the word go. There's a lot of excitement in this book and it doesn't slow down, not even when you get to the end. Scientific laboratories experimenting on people, and who knows what else, aliens, jungles filled with poisonous fruit, and a cast of characters and events right out of our history books. And to add to the intrigue, a few mysteries are woven in, Area 51, Atlantis, and the Bermuda Triangle, just to name a few. Jesse, the heroine, is smart, intuitive and curious. And that curiosity is the catalyst for the adventure. Gelsheimer and Keats have quite the imagination and it shines in this installment to the Aurora Conspiracy Series.<br /><br />Jesse's parts are written in first person and the other characters' are written in third, however, the separation of the two is sometimes blurred. The authors are in everyone's head in a single scene, putting together first person POV Jesse with the 3rd person POV of other characters in consecutive paragraphs making it at times, difficult to follow and implausible (not knowing how one person could know what the other person is doing.) There's also a lot of telling and not much showing, as the authors, using too many beats, don't leave much to the reader's imagination, describing each emotion, thought, action, and reason for reaction of the characters.<br /><br />The book was enjoyable, and I recommend it.  And, now off to read Aurora Conspiracy the Series: Crash Landing.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Written in very terse and simplistic prose, this epistolary novel follows a high school freshman as he struggles with his first year in a new school. It is possibly the most honest book I have ever read, a fact which makes you as a reader fall in love with the band of misfit characters. With its simplistic form and easy-to-read exposition, this is a story that will make you laugh, cry and ponder.
086571701X|5.0|I had only heard about aquaponics previous to reading this book.  I found it explained the process well enough I will not be hesitant to jump in when this project time comes!
B00CWIMY3O|5.0|I love me some Hanni and Gillian Anderson is wonderful!!! The whole cast is superb, actually. One of the best shows on tv now
B00AA7V2Z0|5.0|I love this show! The acting is excellent, the plot is intricate, and it has a high suspense factor in every episode:) If you like the idea of an ONGOING scary movie THIS IS FOR YOU:) I cant wait for season 2(Asylum) to be available on Prime(HINT HINT to Amazon) or even on one of the competitor services:] ALL seasons so far are stand alone, meaning you DON'T have to watch the previous season to watch the other seasons because they are COMPLETELY DIFFERENT STORYLINES and are not related to eachother at all. Im watching the current season now(season 3, Coven) But I USUALLY prefer watching entire seasons of shows all at once:) Happy Horror watching, my friends;)
B00992CF6W|5.0|I am super board at home so I get on mineralogy and it keeps me entertained for hours best game ever!
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|I'll be honest -- I've read just about everything Sanderson has published (in a mainstream way, anyway) and I love all of it. This is no exception.  It's not part of his normal cosmere stuff, it's closer to science fiction than it is to most of his normal fantasy, though he uses enough &#34;science&#34; in his magic systems to blur the difference anyway.<br /><br />If you're looking for a fun read suitable for all ages, this is a good one.
B00FJTYDKK|4.0|Kids (and adults) really enjoyed it!  Will rent it again for sure or maybe even buy it for the family.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This was a gift for my son and he loves it!  This was one of his gifts on his list and he is very happy.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|This is a fun card game. I recommend it to anyone who likes card games. It has replay value. This is a fun card game for the entire family. I highly recommend it.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This in some measure is cathartic. Not really gimmicky. Seemed credible in premise. This is Great movie material! 5 stars.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is an addicting and fun game. It is really neat to see how individual everyone's village is when given the same goals. It lets you be creative and unique.

B008G33PMI|2.0|Virtuoso performances, but not my taste. I expected more of the Nightwish sound. There are other symphonic metal groups out there that have more engaging female lead vocals.
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|This is an amazing tale of what we are forfeiting for our 'freedom' to use technology to create a new world. I won't go into the details, but must say this is a must read for anyone following the current &#34;Spy&#34; fiasco in the US. I could not put the book down, and remained riveted until the end. Well written and edited!
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|This book was as funny as the first, and it had one small theme that was constent throughout it, Greg's greatest secret. The ending is not disappointing but the book whizzed by. It has almost a joke on everypage however, so it is definetly one to read again. The book has the same simple, casual style of the first. What makes them so funny is the fact that the writer, (Greg,) is entirely un-aware of his true self. Taking a blunt view, he is a completely accurate definition of a wimp, but the situations he is put in, and the all-knowing style with which he rights make this a comic gem. This isn't the book that will tak the place of classic literature but it is a entertaining and amusing read. If you liked the first book, and still do, you will almost surely like this one. If you didn't, this one won't make you change your mind. If you don't know about it, it is about Greg Heffely, who has a friend named Rowley who is simple and dumb, a mean older brother named Rodrick, a well meaning Dad who lacks confidence, a practical Mom, and a ever chsnging status at school.<br /><br />  SPOILERS BELOW.<br /><br />  In this book, Greg joins a swim team, has a fateful sleepover, earns money through Mom bucks, becomes popular at school, gets locked in the basement, plays a new game but his Mom plays and has a completely different style, Rodricks band goes all over the web, Rowley goes to South America, and Greg has a french pen pal. Theres more too. In conclusion, this book is a funny enlightening read with many twists and a hilaruous anti-hero.
B000YHG72E|5.0|I loved this movie when I was a little kid. So I figured I would buy it . Very funny and child appropriate . It gets you in the christmas spirit .
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|It's building so much intensity already this season.  I'm just fascinated, (and somewhat apprehensive!), to see where they are going with the story line.  I'm afraid we are going to lose some of the original team!  Such great writing on this show!
B004X6PRO6|4.0|This book carried me through to the end. It's one of those books that is hard to put down. While some of the descriptions were lengthy, they gave you a pretty realistic idea of what it is to live in N. Korea. I have been to Panmunjom and seen the emotionless stares of the soldiers. The book takes it way beyond and goes into the lives of the people who struggle to survive while Dear Leader gorges himself on every conceivable luxury. The one criticism I have is the author's excessive use of the term &#34;Dear Leader&#34;. Surely there is a pronoun or other word that would serve to carry the point.
B009A87X80|5.0|Beautiful music. Her Vocals and guitar work are wonderful. It is sad she died at such a young age. Worth every cent.
B007R21JJK|5.0|I've had this bad boy running nonstop for six months.  It is very stable, has sufficient ports, and is a good size.  Very pleased with this purchase.
B00FAEPX9Y|5.0|I try and bring up Lorde with every person I come in contact with because her music is so different and real than anything currently out there, at least in this genre (which is almost it's own genre.) It is mind blowing in every respect that this girl is only 16 years old. Her songwriting will be up there with Morrissey in due time. A little Ellie Goulding/Beck/St. Vincent come through in the music but her voice is hard to describe. It's soulful, pop, haunting, powerful, young and old all wrapped up into one. A self described 'loser' who is the best female vocalist of this generation. If you watch two youtube interviews you can tell that she is the person she describes in 'Royals' which makes me love her music even more.<br />When I wake up I feel that if 'Pure Heroine' isn't playing in the next 15 minutes my house just might burn down. The beats are fat and solid with minimalist 'instruments' but it all comes together and packs a punch musically that I cannot get over. Some songs even make this 26 year old white boy want to dance.<br /><br />My favorites are 400 Lux***, Tennis Court, Royals, White Teeth Teens, Ribs, Team, Glory and Gore, Still Sane, A World Alone and Buzzcut Season. If it feels like I listed the entire damn album, I just might have because 'Pure Heroine' really knocks it out of the park.
B00FEHXCIG|3.0|It's of but it does get old after seeing the first 2 versions. Kind of the same old plot as the others.
B001O2QW9G|5.0|Ordered this item for my table.. My grandson took it home. He loves things like that. Especially the dinosaurs they offer.  Item was shipped very fast and I have no complaints on this item.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Good in a creepy almost too personal way.  Loved it.  Highly recommend this book - read it in one sitting.
B00FX8FQ76|5.0|expecting this album to have as many number 1 hits as the last one did.  she is maturing as a singer - great album
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|so happy you got this app...... I love candy crush and when I got my kindle I was so upset that I couldn't play candy crush on it I tried everything and now I am so happy haven't had any issues with the app love love love
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|Great moive and the acting was for the record books!<br />I would recommend this moive to someone who likes the mob type moives!
B000NY12LO|4.0|Wish the endings of Jodi's books were not so abrupt.  The ending is revealed and wrapped up in just a few pages.  I noticed the same thing in House Rules.  That said, I love Jodi and will keep reading until I run out of her stuff!  Great page turner.  Love it.
B000FA5TTW|3.0|You know when people say the book is better. In this case the movie is better. Granted there is a lot of differences from book to movie and some of the scenes in the book i wish were in the movie. Overall i am glad i read it, but i still choose the movie
B00CH26TL8|5.0|This game is good but hard to do at times. I am just learning it. My ways are not I enjoy it.as.fast as it wants me to be. I enjoy it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game! I have been playing for a long time on my PC on FB so I was excited to load and play on my Kindle.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|This cool takes you on an epic adventure with Thorgin who discovers he has powers that have determined his destiny. He fights for love and a place in the kings legion.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I loved this book. It fosters some very thought provoking questions about the human race and the limits of our own self. A read for the young and the old.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love trying to conquer each level. It is very addictive but fun. Make sure you have the time because you want be able to put it down.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it ..... Love it..... Love it. I Reilly can not get enough of this game. I play every chance I get, it's that good.
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|I have ordered a lot of DVDs which include a Digital Disc.<br /><br />This package says it does, but it comes with info on how to download this movie instead.<br /><br />The banner for this package should say  &#34;3D Blu-Ray and Digital Download&#34;.
B00F91SCXC|5.0|Awesome action packed flick. Brad Pitt is great. The special effects are very good. I will be watching it again.
B004S3MB2U|4.0|This is a great calculator app not only is it a scientific calculator it can also factor time, weight, distance, etc. It could use some improvements such as being able to see the full equation at once before pressing enter and being able to do exponents on numbers other than 10 but other than that I have found nothing wrong with the app.
1587143879|5.0|This cert library is a great resource to have. The books are well written and offers two different paths for reading them.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Tears come to my eyes knowing that since I am writing this review my story with this series is over. But man was it a good one. There was so many emotions I bad going into reading this final book of how I personally wanted closer and although it was extremely heart breaking at times she did just that.<br />This books is exciting, suspenseful, emotional, and captivating. I'm so glad I fell in love with this series. So many life lessons about life, happiness, love, fear, bravery, and death.<br /><br />It is a MUST READ series. 100% better than Hunger Games series.<br />Cannot wait till the movie comes out. Hopefully they do it justice.
B00E8B1358|5.0|If you love movies that are completely implausible, with goofy “I’ll be back” dialogue, copious over acting, cool weapons, and mass explosions. Then you’re going to love this movie. Who needs the CIA or FBI when you have The Rock, Bruce Willis, and The GI Joes? Kicking ass is what they do. Better then the first movie.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Love. ...love....love this show!! Dont understand why I his isn't on tv every week.  Watched 1 show and was hooked.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's addictive, can't stop playing it. My kids and I love the minions!!! Good for all ages even my two year old loves this game!!
B007FTZDN8|5.0|I enjoyed Zealot and plan to read it again. Aslan makes learning about biblical history a thrilling experience. Jesus lived and had family.
B001I45UFC|5.0|I loved this as a child and my daughter loved it.  She read it just before her 10th bday and couldn't put it down.  She had previously seen the movie and liked it but loved the book even more.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game cleverly dispenses a new 'life' every half hour, giving me a reason to walk away and get caught up on my other tasks periodically. If you want special assists and such, you can buy them (and more turns, it seems) without waiting. The variations on the basic  candy match challenge charge the player to develop sequence strategies to complete each screen. Occasionally, a screen will be time-limited, but most screens at the lower levels (where I am!) give a limited number of moves as well as a challenge...clear all jellies, drop all ingredients to the bottom, etc. Good game!
1490313370|5.0|I find his style of writing very clear and he has a unique way of getting his points across.<br /><br />He's been in the firing line, in the trenches and experienced the battle of being a business owner. James really shows he cares for us by attempting to guide us though the minefields.<br /><br />He does this exceptionally well. He doesn't sugar coat things or wrap it up in cotton wool like many others. I highly recommend buying this book and also getting a separate copy for each of your kids too!
B005JLN9ZI|5.0|Great great great. The cd was in perfect condition. No scratches. It included all the original material. It was like brand new. Couldn't be better
B00EDPFJA4|5.0|Amazing album. Will be on repeat for the year. Drake is an amazing artist. If your not a fan, your deaf.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|Jajjjj the ashley Greene and Dragons the girl in this country and its allies of mine and its impact the girl who are
0446576220|5.0|I highly recommend reading this book. If you're a budding entrepreneur I think you'll gain a lot from this book. I know I certainly did. There's a reason Zappos is growing to be one of the greatest online/sales companies of our time. Because they care and can show you the love.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy to see Candy Crush for the kindle, now don't have to sit at the computer to play. Now release the other saga games.
B00FMPCMRM|2.0|Amazon won't let me review individual episodes.<br />Here is an update:<br />I cancelled after midrun in the fifth season - it just got stupid.<br />Catherine is back, yet again, Damon IS a VAMPIRE and everyone chides him for being one,I found him a lot more interesting than Steffen with his Bunny diet.After 5 years I have had enough of Cat and the love triangle.( I was cheering too, for her to die, finally!)<br />Maybe that is what the teenies want, it's okay - after all it was written for them, but I can't deal with this neverending soap anymore!<br />Everyone is on damons case for being a vampire ,yet vampires is what this show is based on.He is the closest thing to being one on this show - the way this is going I would rather watch Bunnicula .<br />That seems to be what the audience wants.<br />I feel sorry for the actors, they are Great, they are believable, do what they are told,are really,really good at it, but the writers are dropping the ball.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|RTyan family to be excellent.Am a big fan of Clancy. Enjoy pilot and twists and turd story line. Jack junior and team are fun and engaging as well as the father as President. Current themes with todays headlines.
B00FN811SY|5.0|This app is amazing. You can read the Bible and instantly compare translations, including the King James version as well as the Byington translation of the Bible. All of this at the tap of a button.  It's clear that an incredible amount of effort went into this app.<br /><br />Have you ever wondered about the meaning of a Bible character's name?  Tap on the asterisk next to the name and you will be linked to the answer.  This will also work with the names of some cities and regions.<br /><br />I am reading Genesis at the moment.  Where God is telling Jacob (Israel) \\"I myself will go down with you to Egypt, and I myself will also bring you back from there, and Joseph will lay his hand on your eyes.\\"...  I wondered what that last part meant.  Well, I clicked on the asterisk at the end of the sentence and learned that this meant God was telling Jacob that Joseph would close his eyes in death.<br /><br />As of today, October 30th, 2013, this app is not available for download from Amazon on my Kindle Fire. It is possible to \\"side load\\" this app and I believe other reviewers have explained how this can be done. I did side load the app and it works seamlessly on my Kindle Fire.
B00119ZMKW|5.0|Stargate has had my attention from the beginning.  Even with cast changes, they always managed to keep the stories fresh and entertaining.  I'm not much for suspending my beliefs of the reality I can see, but SG-1, as improbable as it was, always seemed possible to me.  I would call this very entertaining science fiction, even for those of us who are not really fanatic.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|Good if you just want to monitor your feed. Didn't do much more than that, so I'm not certain about its suitability for other purposes.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|This season, starting out very intense.  You are getting to know more about the characters in this zombie saga.  And more gore and guts.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Finished it because I wanted to know how it ended but didn't really enjoy the book.  I don't understand all the hype around it.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|you could spend a lot of money to try to get off that level.  I think this kind of ruins the fun for me.  And I do hope that anyone with children makes sure that they are not playing this game with free access to automatic uploads.  That could get expensive.
B008LH4YYC|2.0|I downloaded this to sideload an app, but after looking through its settings, these seemed to be a little too intrusive. I deleted it from the device.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|We love walking dead!!!!! Im really glad they came up with a series that is so good to watch. Just Awesome
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Everything was put together so perfectly and the ending was so bittersweet I couldn't decide. I wish there was another book but all good things must come to an end.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I played it on my friends' I pad and I loved it so I'm so exsited for it to be on my kindle fire
B004GFN11A|4.0|I used this to quickly administer several WP sites and that it does well. I wouldn't suggest updating themes or WP itself in case these break your site and you can't get somewhere to fix it via FTP or database. Nice for editorial work and formatting posts that others have worked on previously.
B0050KDF7U|5.0|The DSD remaster of this title is the first instance where the vinyl (original) was outdone by a digital format.  I did not think this would be possible.
B0042J6VUS|5.0|well made, holds Sony action cam on a tripod or on a flat surface.  It locks the camera in securely. I recommend this item to hold the Sony action cam steady for what ever your filming.
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|Just like the son of anarchy, Charlie Hunnam does a wonderful job. The special effects were done very well. Good film
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love the game it challenge.gives me something to do.I recommend ever one to play this game.love it love it love love
B00F87ZUYG|3.0|Prison setting getting old. As for &#34;testing&#34; the charters, just surviving isn't test enough? Come-on and think up a better plot line. &#34;HINT&#34; it is all about the writting....
B000NY12CI|4.0|Having lived in the Middle East in the 80's and seeing how women are such second class citizens I was always puzzled why women didn't organize for better treatment and rights.  I thought it was just comfort with the known and acceptance of the way things are, I didn't realize that the literal reading of the Koran supported the way women are treated.  Being Catholic I liked her comparison to the way my religion was in the Middle Ages to Islam tdy, it makes sense. Certainly there is inequality in the Catholic Church too but nothing like the powerlessness of women in Islam. The lack of evolution is rooted in lack of enlightenment and moral examination of the written word.  Those in power want to stay in power and the easiest way is subjugation of others.  I always wondered where the moderate voices of Islam where, especially after the many senseless acts of violence, most of them against their own people. Ms. Ali is beyond brave and has sacrificed a &#34;normal&#34; life to address the plight of women, I salute her and everything she has achieved above all expectations.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Though originally hesitant about reading this book, I became immersed in its story line from the very first chapter.  Each chapter switches from the past to the present day, weaving a beautiful story.  A great read!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Normally I get quite frustrated by puzzle games, getting to a point where I fail to solve and then fail to play. Not the case with the room! There is a (?) Hint button that will offer a general, then a little more specific and finally an obvious clue to each portion of the puzzle. Combined with realistic graphics and an equally unsettling sound track, it became one worth solving and then playing all over again!
B00F8MIIKO|5.0|Though not the very best Pixar movie ever made, it is arguably the funniest.  Kept my entire family, young and old, laughing throughout the film.  Great story and wonderful family entertainment.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This is a crazy super addictive game. The physics are great. It is a great way to pass the time while wIting. Though I miss steering control the simple two button approach really delivers especially in tight spaces.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|For years I've been getting DVDs in the mail from Netflix.  When I saw Chromecast I jumped all over it - bought two to start.  Set up had a couple of glitches, but once that was done, streaming from Netflix worked well, with reasonable quality and continuity.  But there is ONE BIG PROBLEM.  None of the recently released movies that I wanted to watch was available for streaming.  Nothing but older movies, most of which I had never heard of.  So I went to Netflix Live-Chat and found out that to stream a movie, they FIRST have to negotiate a license with the movie company, and that can take more than a year, and in many cases they never get the license at all.  So I now have two devices that don't do me a lot of good.  Anyone have another source besides Netflix for streaming movies that are Chromecast compatible?????
B000I5Y8ZU|4.0|Not much to say, this is a modern classic, you either love it or hate it, I can't imagine that you haven't already heard it, if you haven't give it a try, it is a terrific album.
B004FRB3OQ|5.0|EX3 Cards can get extremely expensive. So when our Production Team needed to find a way to afford multiple cards for an upcoming shoot, we turned to the Sonnet SDHC Memory Card Adapter. The ability to purchase SDHC Cards over EX3 cards saves us a ton of money ($60 - SDHC vs $350 - EX3).<br /><br />We field tested the cards and the workflow before the shoot and didn't see any major differences between the EX3 or SDHC cards.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is such a fun game. And it is very addicting. I think everyone should get and play this game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is far too addicting. It's a definite must have but consumer beware...you WILL end up buying lives at some point, rather than waiting for 1 per 30 minutes.
B00FI7XBIS|1.0|Very confusing I might be getting to old but I couldn't make head or tails out of it. That's why it's so nice,. Amazon has so many games to choose from  and if one don't work you have a lot more to try.
B00G32OER4|5.0|Great movie if you like being scared. Storyline was well done and the graphics incredible. Highly recommend for a spooky Halloween night movie
B0035LMTZA|4.0|Good movie that keeps your intrest the whole time! I can re watch this movie every now and then, which makes it ok with me.
B009949RKC|5.0|Remade twice..why..<br />Nothing compares to the original.<br />No wonder both Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie were nominated for academy awards.<br />That rarely happens with horror films.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works flawlessly was easy to setup. I love it and suggest anyone buy one! Simply a great item Thanks Chromecast meow!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Really different from my usual reads but I loved it. It was bittersweet but we'll written. It's a must read!!
B000FBJAEG|5.0|Loved the book.  Have read several of his books, and found tis one very good, will continue to read more of his series.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so addictive!! Not exactly sure why this one is so addictive, but it's a very challenging game that you can't put down.
B000P0J024|3.0|Great!  My father in law loves it! My wife and I gave it to my father in law last month…. Good band!
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I've recommended to many friends - it's enjoyable to anyone who's been involved with IT management and software delivery. First half everything falls apart, second half they put it back together much better than before!
B00992CF6W|5.0|how do you update minecraft but anyways I love this game woo much that I'm addicted because I had to restart my tablet and it wasent working and when I had to delete minecraft I started to cry because of all the worlds and all the stuff that I built but that was flippen awsome!!!!! But anyways I &lt;3 Minecraft just love it and I know what you guys are thinking that TMI ( too much information) woo Yahoo Peace!
B00F880BWG|4.0|I didn't choose &#34;Love it&#34; because the season has started out slowly, but it's building up quickly. Let's see how the season progresses.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|To date, we have not noted a single word of profanity.  The series is very entertaining.  My only concern is the occasional homosexual &#34;kiss&#34; that takes away from the otherwise clean theme.
B00F8H0LM2|3.0|OK.<br />Little better than previous ones. Offers more options as well. Like options but could use better sounds. Look forward to new games.
B00915G6MG|5.0|Superb, great new stories, and more interesting developments of the team's relationships. Episodes are thrilling and intriguing. Cannot wait for more!!
B004MC0FO8|5.0|I hate to think how many times I listened to a song and could not remember the name of it.  Now I just click on Shazam and it is right there for me. Thisis great.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Bought this for my third grader.  This book got her hooked on reading and she has read all of Riordan's books since.
B000UZPIAW|5.0|Loved the book! Great, real insight into the mind of Nikki Sixx & an unadulterated look into the mind of an addict & individual battling sever depression.  Bought this book for my Kindle, will be buying the hard cover to add to my collection.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|If you enjoyed OITNB as a Netflix viewer, you should really enjoy this book, just be warned that the stories are not exactly the same (less drama and fewer horrific moments in the book) even if the premises are the same.<br /><br />The book is a relatively sedate affair concerned with detailing the ways in which Piper used her time in prison to gain a deeper understanding of herself and the women around her.  The Netflix version is so far much more about Piper becoming unhinged and finding the dark things inside of her.  Both book and TV series show that prison is an unnatural way of life that brings out the best and worst in people.
140053271X|4.0|This was a gift for my granddaughter and she absolutely loves it. It was easy for her to understand and use on her own.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|I love this, and the special features make it so much more. Plus, the price wasn't too bad, and I can only wait for the next one to be that low. The disk worked well, and was easy to navigate. It did what it was supposed to.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|Excellent show and an excellent season.  The only suggestion one could make is for MacGyver to do more James Bonding.
B00CHVIAS4|5.0|This movie is very cute. I like the 3d version the best. Amazon had it for the cheapest that I could find.
B002LW966Y|2.0|Pretty good CD. I was offered this through Amazon for free, so I thought I would try it. It is pretty easy listening, though she honestly doesn't stick out too much for me. I mainly use CD' s for driving and for creative inspiration... she might be good for both, just not right now. The songs are too angry for my liking. I grew out of that years ago.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|We love MacGyver.  It is a classic that highlights knowledge of physics and chemistry (although not entirely realistic all of the time) to fight bad guys -  much better than glamorizing ignorance, rudeness, vulgarity and stupidity that is too prevelant in many of today's shows.  Plus you get the added bonus of seeing fashion and technology from 80's!
B006WXHJNU|4.0|The only reason why I gave this a four star is because I'm not really into these kind of movies but overall it is a good movie. Nice price.
B00BP29SAA|5.0|This is a really fun game. I am Autistic, and this helps me to be less afraid of stores and it's all less confusing for me now.
B008IYR2BA|4.0|For most of this season, I didn't have the same need to watch the next episode like with past seasons. As usual, there is still some good drama and the ending makes it so you can't wait for Seasons 7.
B00947N6UG|5.0|This movie is a cute movie. I bought this one for a gift but I have the 3d version at home and it is awesome. I like how they mix all of the different characters together.
B007C12RDS|5.0|Loved the entire series. It is entertaining, wholesome, and very well-written. Was home sick and watched this, I was sad when the series ended!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|It's funny what a few hours can do. Before the book I couldn't wait until March to see the Divergent movie but after this book I could care less. That's how disappointed I was in this book. It's bad enough that life sucks but now I have to read about it. I normally don't leave long in depth comments but I had to for this book. I loved this trilogy but the last book left me unsatisfied. This book took many turns that were not followed through and many actions that the characters took seemed unbelievable with no real explanation. So many holes in the plot.<br /><br />-----Spoiler------<br />I HATE HATE HATE that the author killed off the main character. The book didn't have to have a happy kum-ba-ya ending but at least leave that possibility open so the readers can speculate what happens when the story is over.....not here. Tris dies saving the people she loved. Great, heroic,....selfless....blah bl<br />ah blah. I get it (not really)....but I don't have to like it.<br /><br />The memory serum plan at the end was not believable. If Tris and her friends can inoculate themselves against the serum then why does everyone who actually works in the same building not have this same inoculation as a precaution? What about the rest of the government that wasn't inoculated? Wouldn't they have come in a restore order? Doesn't make sense.<br /><br />I definitely didn't like the dual pov's but since she KILLED off the main character I can see why she did it. She just didn't do it well. Tris and Tobias sounded the same. I had to keep looking at the beginning of the chapter to see who's pov I was in.<br /><br />-------!---------------------------!-----------------!-----<br /><br />Overall loved the trilogy and left me wanting more....oh I forgot that isn't a possibility anymore. Because of this last book, I wish I never started the trilogy. That is just sad.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|it always says I don't have enough space in my drive to get it. I deleted half my games cuz I love the magic card game. its a wast of time for people with kindle fires. don't get it
B0089LOG02|5.0|The story of two generations is interwoven in such a way as to allow one to understand both and want to know even more.  I loved the book it was a good read and entertaining.
B0085Y4JF0|4.0|This rig was way above my expectations. Others have said they had some problems adjusting the straps, I had none what soever and have enough strap left to adjust for winter wear. Very tough material and stitching and will loosen up with use. Plenty of rooms for AR-15  and .45 acp mags. Velcro makes noise but....  I would definitely recommend this to others.
B00AC8ZJPQ|5.0|I was totally not expecting how great this movie was. I love sci-fi movies, but I thought this was going to be a cartoon/CGI movie. I was going to watch it because I didn't find anything else. Needless to say, it was amazing. The acting was great, especially for younger actors, the character development was perfect, and action and special effects were great. I felt like I was right there with them. More Halo movies of this caliber need to be made. Great jobs guys!
0596007124|5.0|Head First is great at keeping you interested in what you are reading. Everything else just seems so...... well, blah.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|The only reason this gets a 2 and not a 1 is because I really enjoyed this series.  The book was dragging on and on and had a hard time getting to the point.  The whole middle of the book could have been summarized in 1 chapter then everything escalated too quickly the last like 50 pages of the book.  Complete disappointment!  I couldn't wait until I was done with it hoping it would get better.
B00E8G5H6Y|1.0|My kids and I were all excited upon receiving the order but it soon turned into a huge disappointment when the disc failed to load. Not being able to get a replacement from Amazon as well as having now to purchase it from other sellers at a vastly higher cost than the pre-order pricing just rubs more salt to the wound. Amazon, you can and should do better.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I only read this book because I knew the movie was coming out.  Very army based and military style based.  No love story just war war and more war.
B005PK57NU|4.0|I love this show, and season 3 is another season that has captured my heart and attention, unfortunately when I should be doing other thing!
B00FJTWK0U|5.0|Watching these original cinema masterpieces is a great way to escape to a place where all things have a sense of harmony from the beautiful scenery, the limitless time, to the purely intense attraction the duo emanates from the screen...such nostalgia.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|This series is amazing.  This book was the first novel I EVER read in 1 day.  You keep wanting to come back for more!!
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|The Husband's Secret was a good enough story line, but the same messages were repeated continually redundant). It was an easy read, fairly shallow, but the notes at the end were fun to read.
B0063M22QO|3.0|Great game to occupy some time with. Addicting yet light enough that you can play during commercials and pick right up where you left off without missing a beat!
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I'm a Downton Abbey fan, because of it's quiet, more civilized program content.  Not really into the wealthy & titled part, but it is interesting to see how that era functioned, and the historical evolution of woman's rights!  In my opinion, it is very well done, and great option to view, instead of the programs offered on nonpublic TV stations!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Wow! Its way beyond five stars for me!! Its my best read this year. The author is one of a kind and I will seek out more of his books!
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|John Mayer consistently puts out AWESOME CD's; each one with more showmanship and expertise than the last. I own every one. Born & Raised is no exception! Don't get me wrong, as each album/CD has got many of my personal favorites but as he cranks out new CD's, his masterful guitar playing shines. Just paid $500 to be in front row of live concert and worth every cent!
1451666179|5.0|If you're anything like me, you may spend hours on Amazon looking up products, comparing prices, and reading reviews to figure out if a particular item is worth spending money on.<br /><br />Whatever sort of thing you're researching now is irrelevant. Stop what you are doing and buy this book.<br /><br />Seriously.
B000I55YV2|4.0|Good acting by the entire crew, interesting plot, and very suitable ending for the bad guy who double crossed everyone at the beginning of the movie.
B00ARF93AQ|2.0|The origanal was way better this version was less believable I wasn't impressed.plus they xhanged the bad guy and made it silly
B0088X7YMS|2.0|Bob Heinlein is still spinning in his grave. None of these films are acceptable if you've read the original novel.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|.<br />This game is fun and addicting and can keep you entertained for a long time. Looking forward for more levels to come.
B004X75RK4|5.0|Not sure how we missed this one when it first came out but it was well written, well acted and an enjoyable movie.
B009APMNB0|5.0|I love this little device.  It is compact, easy to use and allows me (finally!) to print full color images that reflect what is on my screen.  The X-Rite Color Munki Smile is a great tool to make quick adjustments to your monitors.  The included software is easy to install and use.  If you don't have a DVD drive on your computer, it can be easily downloaded from the X-Rite website.  Calibration is simple: just hang the Color Munki Smile at the indicated location on your monitor, and hit OK!  The process takes about ten minutes from start to finish.  The software will remind you when its time to recalibrate.<br />Unlike some of X-rite's more expensive models, the Smile does not come with designated color profiles for individual printers - but it is perfect for use in a home printing environment.
B0018BB20W|5.0|I have their album and wanted the MP3 and cd, so I purchased both at the same time for a great price. Arrived on time and in great shape.
B003BW0CB6|5.0|Great characters, who belong together. Great storyline. Hard to get much work done when you start a Lincoln Lawyer book.  B
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I read all of Gillian Flynn's novels in less than a month and this one was definitely my favorite.  Characters were well developed and story ending was a surprise.  I could not put this one down.
B000HAB4KS|5.0|After all these years, this movie is still a favorite! Great acting, cool story line, action packed and thought provoking.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game!  Definitely keeps you on your toes and makes you use your brain power!  Keep the levels coming and interesting!
B00G8YZ48K|5.0|This is by far the best season, story wise.  the growth in the attractors is great you can feel how  Rick and Carl fight with what they had to do last season.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I have never been so angry with how a book/series ends. The ending is horrible! Though the rest of the book isn't too great either. Books 1 and 2 were fantastic. This was entirely different. When an author writes from 2 points of view, the points of view need to sound different, they don't. Four becomes much weaker than you are shown in the first 2 books. He becomes a bit too much like Tris. I could go on and on about how many times this book acts like it is going somewhere awesome but then doesn't. Between all the climaxes that lead to nothing and the horrible ending, this book isn't worth the read. Stick to the first 2 and enjoy them, don't let this book ruin the series for you.
B0012HQKZE|5.0|Is an amazing fascinating story...i love it,and is a kind of movie the every time you see it you will always find a new detaill.totally,worth it.
B00ADQPA38|5.0|This season of American Horror had multiply stores going on at the same time as the first season but each store was much more complex.  The cast even the supporting actors embraced their roles & became their characters.<br /><br />A must see!<br />Robert Cooper
B000003S5H|5.0|France is not really known for its classic rock and pop output. I think it has something to do with the French sensibility and penchant for cabaret, Edith Piaf, and melancholy accordion. (There was an artist in the '70s called Plastic Bertrand who had a sizable hit with the irritating Ca Plane Pour Moi. It was sung in French so we naturally assumed he was French. Turns out he was Belgian; no matter, this put a lot of us off \\"French\\" pop for good). It may be that the language is just not suited to rock and pop like English and German is, but that belies the fact that Quebec has had its fair share of good rock and pop groups. At any rate I wasn't aware of any memorable French bands, so that was my (probably naïve) position -  until these guys came along.  I first heard this album in '98 during dinner at a restaurant in old Quebec City (they tend to play some good stuff in that fair Canadian province). Enquiring of the waiter as to who it was I was duly given the cd cover to look at. I promptly went out and bought the cd the very next day.<br />So what's so good about it? A return to analogue synthesis for a start. You notice it immediately, as I noticed it even through the chatter in that restaurant. There's none of that digital clinicality so prevalent through most of the '80s and 90s, but a real warmth that is associated with analogue VCOs and circuitry. Yes, these guys went back to turning pots and patching cords, and it shows. (Note: old '70s/early '80s analogue synths and beat boxes were fetching quite the sum through the '90s by people wanting that  classic \\"sound.\\" In the last 5 or 10 years, there has been a resurgence in analogue and there are many options out there - usually with more stable circuitry than they had back in the day!). Look at the kit these boys are using on this album: Korg MS20, Minimoog, the incomparable ARP Solina string synthesizer (remember all those warm, soaring string sounds of '70s prog rock? It was likely either the solina or a mellotron). Not one Yamaha DX7 to be found, here. This alone was enough for me, but then factor in those cool melodies and that trancey lounge vibe and you have a classic album. Actually, a groundbreaking one. Vive la France!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I see this book has really poor reviews, but I liked this 3rd installment in the Divergent series.  It didn't end the way I expected it would, but i thought it was well written and wrapped up the series fairly nicely.
B00CS74W0C|5.0|I Love This Series!! I've read them thru twice. Just got better the 2nd time around. A lot of people have compared this to 50 Shades Of Grey. It is similar in that they are erotic fiction, but Sylvia Day describes her characters more in depth. In my opinion. I REALLY enjoyed this series (both times).
B00BKZUVGM|5.0|It's so sad that this series has come to an end. I have a definite book hangover right now :(
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I totally love this book! I have read all the ones that are out now and can not wait for more! Eva and Gideon are awesome!
B008B68IUY|5.0|My daughter got this car for her birthday and we both really enjoy playing with it. It's been about 5 months and it has held up very well.
B00EUGYM04|5.0|This two disc set caps off a decade of memories, I've been hooked on Seether since I first heard the beautiful &#34;Broken&#34;. And the band's mix of angst & heartfelt lyrics often got me through the occasional lousy day. The cult hits &#34;Truth&#34;, &#34;Broken&#34;, &#34;The Gift&#34;, etc. are all featured on this collection along with some &#34;B sides&#34; called  &#34;The Might Have Missed&#34; featuring a great cover of Verucca Salt's  &#34;Seether&#34; from which the band takes it's name. Looking very forward to what the band rises above next!
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Fascinating!  Makes me want to read the bible to see how accurate it all is. Five more words yes please
B007IXWKUK|5.0|did not see any of that coming! now onto the 3rd book. the end of this book has got me all sorts of confused!!!!
B000I9YWDO|5.0|Great movie. I laughed and laughed at it. Very, very funny with perfect casting. A real winner and a classic.
B00FPH6PRK|2.0|OK film, but not great. It really takes little pieces from older, classic paranormal movies and came out just too predictable.
B009JVSAVM|5.0|I am very satisfied with this purchase ,description said used but it looks brand new to me still in the shrink wrap .
B004NYQYNQ|5.0|Always a joy to hear this artist!  Reminds me so of Ella Fitzgerald in her style and delivery. Flawless, classic.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Very nicely put together and keeps you on your seat most of the book very nice!! thank you for the book
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Good start with interesting characters but dwindles off. Might try another book by this author. Enjoyed the descriptivr Austrailian settings.
B00005AQE8|5.0|Fantastic album. So glad I bought it. Amazing music from a very talented artist. Highly recommend it!<br />RIP 2Pac &#60;3
0786955570|5.0|I love this game I got it cause I thought it looked like a lot of fun and I was right.  My friends and I have been having a blast with it.
B00FPH3YQA|2.0|Tries to be more drama, less comedy. Best joke is in about the first 15 minutes. The only typical &#34;Hangover&#34; moment is at the very end. Not worth it.
B00ECUARO8|2.0|Far fetch with love and crime plot. I was hoping that Matthew's accent would have been better and desired more action instead od kids living up to their acting skills.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Colleen Hoover is a wonderful writer. So many gems in this book. I'm a senior so reading about teen love is not usually the draw for me. I read an except and knew I had to read this book.
B001POX73C|4.0|Funny and spunky heroine, unexpected hero, interesting story that differs somewhat from the author's other works but is still entertaining, nonetheless.
0375851569|5.0|My five year old daughter is in kindergarten and is starting to learn how to read. I thought learning her sight words by reading them in a story would be more fun than just using flash cards. Her favorite book is Green Eggs and Ham. I like that the words are repeated throughout the book, so there are lots of opportunities to use them. Dr. Seuss's books makes learning how to read fun!
B007VDN1PA|4.0|Not much to say other than that it works as advertised.  Anytime you do 35mm slide scanning there will be tradeoffs.  This works as well as any of the commercial slide scanning services, so if you have a bunch of slides, you may find it cheaper to buy one of these rather than have some service do basically the same thing.  When done... sell it on eBay.  That's where you'll find mine when I get done.  I have about 1000 slides and am about half way done.  I don't use 35mm film anymore so this is a one time deal for me.
B00FWLDHSY|2.0|It could be that I've just had it with action movies of this kind.<br />I found the gigantism kind of boring.<br />I found the plot and characters juvenile, and common as hell.<br />I found the dialogue fitting.. way too small compared to the huge size of the problems posed, and the solutions<br />attempted, not to mention the actual biggy bigness of the giga-giants, and well, just blenderized everything else.<br />All the usual 'twists and turns', which in effect were not surprising ever.<br /><br />Nobody had enough anything to 'act'.<br />This was a misuse of some very very talented people.<br />I wouldn't watch this twice.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Just great.  Nobody re-writes history the way Tarantino does.  Great acting, directing, filmwork, writing, the whole nine yards.  Just a great film.
B008133MDK|5.0|Great characters, story lines, although the death scene and return seems far fetched.<br />Will it be the same fate for Jim?
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I have this app on my smart phone and now my Kindle Fire HD.  It can be very challenging as you learn how to play it, however I find it fun to play.  It is a good game to play while waiting  for your the train, bus, or your next appointment. Highly recommend it.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I swore I would never play this game.<br />I play this game.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Fun with some easy boards but lots of challenging ones.<br />Free to download<br />Can get extra lives etc from facebook friends<br />Can sign in from facebook, so can play on Kindle Fire, from my phone and from my p, all without losing my place.<br /><br />Cons: But because it's free to download, you only get a limited play without getting help from friends or spending real $<br />I'd rather pay 2.99 up front for the game and then play for free. But the publishers make much more by having you pay for extra lives etc.<br /><br />I don't pay for extra, so once I am done with my free lives, that's it. I quit for the day. Which is good because I could see myself wasting hours on it, it is pretty addicting and would be a big time sink if I could play unlimited.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|i didnt realize that it was a continuation of the shinning may years later  - i enjoyed it a lot - king never looses his touch - keeps me coming back for more.
0307730697|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  The number of times this guy got knocked down and just kept getting back up was amazing.  He overcame tremendous adversity in his life in order to make his dreams come true.  Sure, he made some mistakes but, he eventually figured it out and rose to the top of his field.  My service is nothing to his sacrifice or the sacrifice of all the other brave men and women that have given it all for this country.  &#34;Non sibi sed patriae&#34;
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! It lead me to continue reading on to the second and third books, finishing the trilogy in one week. The passion that the two main characters have for each other is intensely exciting and thrilling. It makes you wish relationships like this exist in real life. I highly recommend this trilogy to everyone, even men. They can probably learn a thing or two from Mr. Grey. Enjoy.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a great game for when you have a little time or a lot.  It makes you think but not too much.
B005KIQTWU|5.0|We weren't going to get this due to the price, but our son wanted it so bad. He decided to use his own money and felt a real sense of accomplishment and joy when it arrived. It configures a couple of ways and this is one of few toys that gets more than a few minutes of his attention every day. He is 3
B008Y212PI|5.0|Well ok it's not what you think of when you think of a logic puzzle but logic definitely comes into play. the puzzles are fun and entertaining. They do make you think at times (use logic) but not to the point of getting frustrated and giving up. Good for a variety of ages too. I'm 51 and my daughter is 14 and we both love it.
030789701X|5.0|love the book.i have been playing awhile and was still able to find new things that I did know about
B00DZJ82W6|5.0|Attention all Van Morrison and audiophile fans, stop reading and buy the deluxe edition. Many Van fans like myself are tired of not having high quality Van music at our fingertips. This Deluxe Moondance album was exactly what we needed. The outtakes are great, the BluRay audio disc is superb and the packaging was very well done as well.<br /><br />The outtakes can be a bit repetitive but once i copied the songs to my iTunes i listen to each track at random and keep track of the ones I love w/ the iTunes rating system. I haven't listened to them all yet but so far a few favorites of my are Caravan Take 1, Into The Mystic (Take 11) & I've Been Working (Early Version Take 1).<br /><br />The BluRay audio was crystal clear. I also own the 2008 Japanese remaster of Moondance and when I compared the two remasters and qualities, the BluRay was better. I haven't heard the 5.1 mix on the bluray yet but I've read good things at other places.<br /><br />The packaging could be a little better but the substance is great. The photos, notes and stories written in there were very enjoyable to read while listening to the album. I had never read the original Moondance linear notes but after reading them in this booklet I was having strange flashbacks to Van's earlier song, T.B. Sheets..... i'm not van scholar but I starting thinking that possibly Moondance (the song) is secretly a TB Sheets Part 2? I don't know, I guess thats neither here or there, just food for thought....<br /><br />Bottom line, if you're reading the reviews, you want this set deep down... so take the plunge and enjoy an amazing way to hear Van again.
B00ERIUO02|5.0|Such a great buy loved every song! Katy Perry is by far my favorite artist ever!!! So happy I was able to pre-order this album and get it so quickly!
B00CHVIAS4|5.0|The Croods is one of those movies that not only entertain, but present multiple messages on multiple levels.  Although there were moments of crudeness (they are cavemen), I can highly recommend this movie.
B002O4JAV0|5.0|Love this album. Definitely a must for kid cudi fans. Keeps me feeling good and reminds me I'm effing awesome.
B0037TPMOA|5.0|Stephen King is a well published writer for a good reason. He takes you into the mind of a mad man and his 5 year old son and the family dynamics that are effected. Loving it
B00FJTYDKK|4.0|Great movie to watch with your daughter [regardless what age she is...]. Change is always hard, but easier as a family.
B00F30S0Y0|5.0|The first time I listened to this, it really didn't get me... I liked the previously released tracks, (We Exist, Here Comes The Night Time, Normal Person), but everything else literally seemed like a dull and dead end for them.<br /><br />By the 3rd listen this is one of my favorite albums ever and definitely my favorite from the band. I don't know HOW they do it, but they manage to remain recognizable as the Arcade Fire we know, while still making a near complete musical stylistic shift.  They are the most consistent band I know of. Yes, more consistent than Radiohead. Radiohead had a winning streak of 3 amazing albums in a row, before making more or less a dud, (The Bends, OK Computer, Kid A, they were each masterpieces, but then Amnesiac was released, which pretty much ended their little victory run). Arcade Fire have released 4 AMAZING albums in a row (all of their albums to date!!!!), and I think every critic and fan of the band would definitely consider each of their albums masterpieces, yes, even Neon Bible.<br /><br />Buying this album is a good idea for EVERYONE. Even if you're not a music fan, you should still buy this, it will amaze you at how the band can capture such brilliance in 85 minutes of music.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|it kicks you out after so many loses and you have to wait a 1/2 hour to play again, OR buy lives, we are given no other option, you have to buy lives or wait.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|This quirky, imaginative, fantasy with some intelligence thrown in was everything I'd ever want to experience. It's kind of a mix of the Matrix on an acid trip with Bill and Ted's Excellent adventure. It was suspenseful, thought provoking, at times emtionally raw and real, with the constant reminder the responsibility that's so great when dealing with something that's unknown. From beginning to end it was perfect.! I rarely if ever use &#34;perfect&#34; when discussing a small screen show.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|Vulgar, sexist language throughout that wears thin. Excessive violence for shock value in lieu of good writing. Largely boring. Last Martin book I will read.
B00C7DGRL4|3.0|Not the best or the worst...There some prettty cool effects but the story line did have it's limits. The premise was interesting, sometimes a little gory.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|When I first saw the movie trailer for the Mortal Instruments: City of Bones I became instantly hooked. All I wanted to do was read the book and all I can say is WOW.This book has you on the edge from the moment you start and you won't be able to put it down For anyone who likes a good supernatural book with action, adventure, and romance then this is the book for you.<br /><br />Some reviews I read didn't like this book, but I totally disagree. The diffrent storylines appeal to all audiences. The story had a great plot and was very suspenseful which just kept me reading. Cassandra Clare really makes the characters come to life. This book was an amazing read but the ending was was shocking and definitly was a cliffhanger but i didn't care because this just led me wanting to read the next one as soon as possible. The Mortal Instruments is an amazing series and I highly recommend it for any teen.

B009AMANBA|3.0|\\"Lincoln\\" dramatizes the efforts by President Abraham Lincoln (Daniel Day-Lewis) to push the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, which abolished slavery in the United States, through Congress before the Civil War came to an end and enabled Southern states to block its passage. It takes place over the last few months of Lincoln's life in 1865 and consists primarily of conversations  -or more often arguments- between Lincoln and Secretary of State William Seward (David Straithairn), Lincoln and radical Congressman Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones), Lincoln and Republican party founder Francis Preston Blair (Hal Holbrook), and many more, as the President wheels, deals, lies, bribes resistant Democrats, and misleads Congress to get the votes for the 13th Amendment. His own advisors oppose the plan at first, and second, as a fight he can't win, and prefer to use the threat of the 13th Amendment to pressure the Confederacy into a surrender.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg directed this mess, with a screenplay by playwright Tony Kushner. To say it is talky would miss the mark. It's more prattle than talk. Lincoln is a self-righteous windbag who will put on a speech to whomever will listen. It's not believable that anyone would listen after a while. He's distasteful, preachy, and sometimes pretty silly, as when he goes on about Euclid to some telegraph operators. We feel the weight of the War on Lincoln's shoulders, but he does not seem to be a man grounded in reality. I have no idea how the filmmakers intended Lincoln to come across, but I doubt  their intentions were realized. When \\"Lincoln\\" is not mired by its title character, it is bogged down in legal and political intricacies. Some comic relief is provided in the form of Republican lackeys who are charged with buying Democratic votes, but that's not as funny as it should be. Thankfully, Tommy Lee Jones steals his scenes as the radical and outspoken Stevens.<br /><br />Though it is refreshing to see people yell at each other on the floor of Congress, rather than the oppressive politeness we have today, those few scenes can't save the film. \\"Lincoln\\" is a political drama without the drama. It is far too long at 2 1/2 hours. The conflict Lincoln has with his son Robert (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a pointless distraction, as this is less a biography of Lincoln than a chronicle of Capital Hill politics. The last 20 minutes are a sort of epilogue that should have been cut. The super-dark interiors are super-conspicuous CGI. There is no light in the rooms during the daytime. There is light at the window, but it does not come in, as if some invisible force were repelling it. Lincoln and his advisors are left to read in daylit rooms that are...dark. The out-of-doors suffers a similar problem. Everything is blue, and the lighting conditions are perpetually at dusk. The cast is top-notch, however. I really should swear off new Spielberg films. They're dreadful.her on the floor of Congress, rather than the oppressive politeness we have today, those few scenes can't save the film. \\"Lincoln\\" is a political drama without the drama.

B00BD99JMW|3.0|A big fan of the divergent but I didn't warm up to the idea of switching point of views as often as I had to in this last installment. Each chapter changed between Tris and Four and that became tedious. Story line in this book was overly convoluted compared to the others. It wasn't as easy a read but still enjoyable.

B0032CVAQQ|4.0|This is a good book that nearly everyone will learn from.  While the 5 Love Languages are directed at intimate relationships, the concepts can easily be applied to any type of relationship, be it work, friendships or familial relations.  The author presents the information as being the one and only final answer to relationship issues; relationships are more multi-layered and complex than this, but the tools presented in this book will certainly help anyone understand their partner better and communicate more effectively with them.  It is definitely worth reading.
031262820X|4.0|I bought this book because I have read all of Sophie Kinsella's books and heard that she and Madeleine Wickham are one and the same person. I was expecting the same style of writing and it is very different. I must say though, that the story did have a lot of depth and the characters were diverse and complex. I enjoyed this book.
B001EC2IT4|5.0|It seems odd to call a movie so silly &#34;timeless,&#34; but this one is. With a very few exceptions, the movie feels as fresh as it did in 1988.
0385342071|5.0|I laughed my head off while reading this book. The story seems so improbable and yet it COULD, maybe, happen. I loved it. I recently discovered Sophia Kinsella and this was the last of the books I have not read. Sob,.......
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|Ive always enjoyed Mr. Gladwells insights in prior books or interviews he has given.<br />Was very excited about this book and really talked up the first few chapters with my friends. As the book can to a close, I was slightly disappointed that the finish was not as strong as anticipated.<br />Still a good read and thought provoking. Look forward to the next book.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Simple calculator.  I have other calculators at home and have no idea where they are.  This one is perfect for my everyday use.
B00BOXZAG6|4.0|There aren't a lot of films out there that try to put you in a place that is totally foreign to what you are used to. I can name a few off with films like What Dreams May Come, The Dark Crystal, Labyrinth and more recently Avatar. Many of these types of movies create a whole different world around you. Upside Down makes what is very close to the world we live in now, but messes with the laws of physics and gravity to the point where what you get a completely new and fascinating experience. While this movie is not a high adventure or exciting action film it does thrive on its visual merits and solid, even if simple, story.<br /><br />Upside Down is essentially a love story done in a fairy tale styled presentation. The story is about two people who fall in love, but live on different planets that are placed so close together that interaction between the two is possible. The downside is you are bound to the gravity of the planet you are from. So our lovelorn boy does everything he can to find a way to defy this reality and find his lost love. That's the story. Nothing complicated. And to be honest a more complicated story may not have lent well to this film. This is not to say there isn't a larger side-plot forming, but that is mostly there to tie loose ends. Besides the simple story does lend itself to giving you lots of opportunity to just soak in some breathtaking visuals.<br /><br />Upside Down is full of fun scenery that plays with the whole two planets vying over each others gravity as well as simply beautiful landscapes, cityscapes and even &#34;office-scapes&#34;. Yeah that picture on the cover is one of the more prominent sets and on a big screen it's nice looking. Those sets that play with the opposing gravity are creative and give that fantastical feel. If you like visually stunning movies this one will definitely win you over.<br /><br />While I personally enjoy this simple love story set on this almost unreal setting I do understand the limitations of theplot do tend to downplay a pretty broad scope this universe introduces us to. More could have been done. I am okay with it not being done, but some of you may now. Also as much I try to wrap my head around this concept of &#34;inverse matter&#34; they use to help further the plot I have a hard time accepting the science behind it. Still it is a plot device that moves the story forward, and nobody said this was a hard science kind of film. As far as suspending disbelief it's not hard to simply accept the rules the movie has made for itself.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray looks wonderful. The colors are sharp, and with every scene having a different color aura it only adds to the visual splendor. The image is clear, but I still note a light grainy texture that gives it that cinematic look. Audio is really impressive with the Dolby True HD 5.1 really taking advantage of the capabilities of surround sound. This is one of those films that enjoys putting atmospheric sound around you and the lossless track excels at it. I never saw the film in theaters in 3D, but the 3D Blu-Ray sure does impress. That aforementioned scene on the cover felt like the office area went on forever in 3D. You get a decent list of extra features that are on both the 3D and Blu-Ray disks. Interestingly enough on the 3D disk the special features are in 3D as well. Kinda cool even if they weren't made for it. Here is the breakdown:<br /><br />The Making Of - This is a really good documentary. It covers a lot of details from the early concepts of the film to production, cast and more. It's good to see a good making of documentary on here. The last few movie extras I've seen lately this feature was more marketing hype than informative. Quite the opposite on this disk.<br /><br />History of the World - An alternate opening with storyboards and commentary by director  Juan Solanas.<br /><br />Deleted Scenes - Less than two minutes of footage from two extended scenes. They are incomplete with no special effectsadded. Not bad, but nothing was lost when it was taken out.<br /><br />Juan and Jim - An odd short (like about 20 seconds) that is made to look like an old reel to reel short from the 1920's. Kinda fun to watch as a distraction.<br /><br />Preliminary Sketches - 24 full color pre-production conceptual artwork.<br /><br />Tango Storyboards - A short comparison of the final footage and storyboard artwork shown on a picture in picture screen.<br /><br />Missing Forest Storyboards - Storyboards of a scene that was never filmed along with director commentary.<br /><br />Sage Mountain, Office and Final Shot Previz - 3 short featurettes showing the previsualization of the scene along with director commentary.<br /><br />Previews - The Upside Down trailer along with five other trailers that come up when you first put in the disk.<br /><br />Upside down is a visual treat with a light dramatic/romantic story to give you an excuse to view all the great scenery. For me it works, but if you want a plot as big as your settings you may find the film lacking. Don't let that stop you from at least seeing it. For those of you who crave that cinematic grandeur of beautiful settings this is for you. In 3D would be optimal for at least the more far reaching sets, but it's not required. If in doubt maybe rent Upside Down first, and then decide if it's worthy of your colletion.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This sequel was just as good as the first. The story plot never got dry or boring. I am excited to read the next book in the series!
B006LSZECO|3.0|The basic story line was good with lots of twists snd turns. The \\"F' word was way over used in this book.  It made for me embarassingly uncomfortable. I would have rated the book a five execpt for the laungage.

B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Most of us know the Biblical Jesus and I have read some history of that era but never had the close feel for the tenor of the times which is so well put forth in Zealot, Life and Times.

B00CLH1PHM|4.0|The American Oscars are on TV and the unknown English actor is hoping a rather more famous English actor will garner an award. There’s a nice touch of name-dropping and name-twisted in this short, neat tale, together with an all-too-plausible storyline of drama and soap.<br /><br />Oscar glamor contrasts brightly with an old has-been watching pay-per-view in the small hours of an English morning, a contrast that carries through to plausible hopes and lost dreams, and then to the story of that failed actor’s life. But success and failure are closer together than they seem. The old man, for all his losses, has achieved most of his dreams, and just one remains.<br /><br />There’s a sting in this tale that makes it well worth the read. And references to the author’s longer novel (fictionally turned into a movie) blend perfectly into the mix of real and imagined Oscar delights. A short tale filled with contrasts, sad and funny, sweet and sour, all perfectly combined.<br /><br />Disclosure: I’ve not read the novel, but I certainly enjoyed this free short story.

B00F30S0Y0|5.0|There have been a couple of things in my life that have changed me. I just sat through this album in the dark, and it was amazing. It's very reminiscent of a very dark 80's esque smokey club sexy feel. It's so hard to describe, but man I love this album.<br /><br />I have loved Arcade Fire from the very beginning, and I am always a little afraid to hear the next album because I'm afraid I'll hate it. I am wrong every single time. This is my favorite AF album. I guess it fits in more with my dark '80s British alternative/pop love.<br /><br />At least listen to the whole album once and just let it soak in.
B00821OX98|3.0|Too much of the story line seems implausible, Why would an advanced entity walk around alone at night? On and on and on. The capacity the united states has to inflict damage and find the enemy seems to be far greater than this moronic alien that is so advanced.

B006RXPTNM|5.0|This film on the subject of doubt first began as a play which won a Pulitzer Prize.  It has a narrow, intense and deep scope with most of the action taking place in a Catholic school and church in the Bronx in 1964.  Philip Seymour Hoffman plays a likable and jovial parish priest, Father Flynn, who likes his pleasures: his wine, his food, and his job apparently. He's an approachable priest.<br /><br />Contrast him to the nun played by Merryl Streep, Sister Aloysius, who runs the Catholic school.  She disapproves of the priest.  She is dour, strict and when you hear about the nuns smacking students' hands with a rule for an infraction, she's the type you can imagine doing so.<br /><br />There's another nun, played by Amy Adams, Sister James, who is asked by Sister Aloysius to report anything doubtful about Father Flynn.  When Adams witness something that concerns her, Sister Aloysius confronts Father Flynn.  Doubt permeates the situation.  Did Father Flynn do anything wrong?  Is Sister Aloysius right in threatening Father Flynn? Did Sister James see what she thinks she saw? And what about the mother of the student involved, played by Viola Davis (Oprah said she begged for that role)?  What does she really want?<br /><br />And we have doubts about Sister Aloysius - wouldn't we rather have that likable Father Flynn around than this frustrated, joy-denying Sister?<br /><br />This film sets up many conflicts, which we, the audience, will have doubts about.  It's a brilliant little film with fine acting by everyone.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|An excellent read as all of the Lee Child Jack Reacher stories are.  Hopefully there will be many more.  Author is as good as the late Vince Flynn.  Keep up the great writing!
B0058UXHHK|3.0|I liked this book in general. The interactions between Rose and her Mom made me feel sick, the interactions between Rose and her Aunt, and Rose and Violet were heartwarming and the interactions between Croaker and Rose left me worried and highly suspicious. The interactions between Joe and Rose left me the most puzzled and interested though. I could see them falling for each other, and certainly believed Rose deserved to find love FINALLY, but the downside for me was that I felt as though Joe's \\"secrets\\" were very predictable. And without giving too much away, it was pretty obvious what was going on with him. However, I did think Rose was charming, especially after living her life with her Momma treating her like she did. And I thought she was truly self less and constantly ensuring the safety of everyone else first and I love that about her. I would like to know what in the world the flash drive contained, but maybe that's for the next book. Overall, a likeable story with a different, special in her own way, sweet heroine. I would give this author another try.

B005LAIIQC|5.0|I love this movie! I think it was a great 4th part to the Bourne series and when I found out that it was in parellel with the 3rd movie that made it even better. I watched it several times already, and it makes a great movie to watch when nothing else is on.
B008UX2UIO|5.0|This book is wonderful and literally made me laugh out loud on the bus or wherever I was while reading...The characters just stand out as bold as life you can hear them speak..hear how they laugh and actually envision them right before your eyes...I cannot believe the author took his own life..but what a gift he left for all of us to enjoy for time immemorial .<br />Dee Ireland Lewis
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|I miss the novels by Stephen King, you know the ones I'm talking about, you read them, thought about them, read them again and loved every minute of it. Books like IT, Pet Sematary, The Talisman and my favorite, Desperation. This book doesn't hit that mark, but I did find myself looking forward to picking it back up when I had the time to read.  The book catches up with The Shining's Danny Torrance, now an adult, and spins a tale encompassing his demons from the past and new ones from the present and includes another &#34;shiner&#34; by the name of Abra who does add a great deal of interest to the novel.  I believe there were elements here which could have been fleshed out a lot more than Mr. King chose to do and had he done so, the novel could have rivaled his earlier works.  In a genre that seems to have lost the intensity of earlier years, this book fits right in with the current horror novels found on the shelves of every book seller.  Definitely worth the read, but I'm still left wanting for the macabre horror that used to be Stephen Kings signature.

B009UWYFFK|5.0|I watched this movie with my grandson, to my surprised I believe I enjoyed more than he did, after he left I watched it again.  The cast was amazing and the story line was of the love between a father and daughter. Will watch it again.

B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|Similar to the darker premise and themes found in the Emmy award winning drama \\"Breaking Bad\\", \\"House of Cards\\" is a political drama that delves deeply into the concepts power and morality. The incredible acting, writing, and camera effects makes the show a masterpiece in suspense and drama, and the modern, political environment aids these elements greatly.<br /><br /> In the opening scene of \\"House of Cards\\", Francis Underwood, portrayed by Kevin Spacey, exits his house to the sound of a dog whimpering after being hit in a drive-by. This is one of the instances when Frank talks directly to the viewer, showing his thoughts and feelings of the situation around him which is a great use of narrative and insight (without others being able to hear this dialogue). I personally love this way of communication in any television show, as it provides you details that couldn't be expressed or intricately detailed any other way. However, in this scene Frank speaks of \\"useless pain\\" that doesn't need to be endured while looking at the injured dog and proceeding to put the dog out of its \\"misery\\". This is exactly the kind of dark, gritty roller coaster ride this show contains.<br /><br /> The year is 2013 and the new president, Garrett Walker, has just been elected the new president of the United States of America. With this election and new term as the premise for the show, Francis sets out on an endeavor with his wife Claire Underwood (Robin Wright), reporter Zoe Barnes (Kate Mara), and Representative Peter Russo (Corey Stoll) to achieve political power and reputation. The choice to set the show in a fictitious United States stood out to me when first watching, and I personally enjoyed this choice in my watching. By using this method, the show is not tied to real world events, and the characters in the government, including president Walker, can be multi-faceted and suited for the show's story and writing. To me, this made the show more realistic and applicable to what is at thecore of modern day politics, and the themes of power and morality relates to everyone since these are aspects of life and interactions with others that people experience everyday, regardless of background or walk of life.<br /><br /> On top of the plot, writing, and themes present in \\"House of Cards\\", the cast is what makes it such a great show. Kevin Spacey does a near perfect job in how he handles himself in the show, and plays the role of a backstabbing, twisted politician seamlessly. Robin Wright, character Francis Underwood's wife and right-hand man, also done a phenomenal job acting and playing the role of a backstabbing, self centered \\"aristocrat\\". The introduction of Zoe Barnes and Peter Russo make the first few episodes interesting as the relation between the main characters are built, and I was at the edge of my seat when I watched them.<br /><br /> The soundtrack for the show is very well composed and well-fitting, as the overtures and melodies create and add tension to the mood while not foreshadowing anything too soon. In this aspect, you're still very much in the unknown while watching \\"House of Cards\\", yet you will know when a traumatic of shocking event is happening. The use violins has become almost staple for the political drama or movie setting, but in this case it's not overused and keeps conversations interesting. A good soundtrack is a key element to a great show, and \\"House of Cards\\" uses theirs appropriately. Along with the well used lighting and camera effects, the show's aesthetics add to the tension and scenes.<br /><br /> The dialogue between Francis and the viewer, already mentioned prior, can be seen many times throughout each and every episode of the show, and this helps push the show beyond simple referential meaning. The plot of a Congressman seeking more power in Washington would seem single-sided and rather dull, but the methods Francis uses and his high degree of intelligence craft a complex battle between good and evil. Francishas to make many difficult decisions in his attempt for power, and each time the viewer sees his heartless nature (although a few times sympathetic). This may not be a battle in itself, but as he has to lie and deceive to other politicians the theme of morality comes into play strongly. In one episode, Francis states: \\"money is the Mc-mansion in Sarasota that starts falling apart after 10 years ... [p]ower is the old stone building that stands for centuries. I cannot respect someone who doesn't see the difference.\\" This can also resonate with viewers since much of the tactics used in this show can be easily observed in news stations today.<br /><br /> At the writing of this critique of \\"House of Cards\\", I have watched two episodes of the show. The plot points that are left off at the end of each episode aren't always obvious, but the political machine that Francis is driving forward draws you in to find out what happens next. The acting, camera effects, writing, and themes turn the show into a multi-layered masterpiece of political drama. I believe the dark underlying overtone makes the show more intriguing and interesting to viewers. Personally, I will continue watching \\"House of Cards\\", although I have not watched or cared for any other political dramas. This says a lot for me since I am very particular in my choosing of television shows, and this one will definitely stay on my roster.<br /><br />P.S.: After watching the first season in full, I purchased the season on DVD and have rewatched it. The entire series is fantastic, and everything I have written in this initial \\"reaction\\" stands true and is only exemplified further now.

1594202273|5.0|The task of an investigative journalist is not only to uncover \\"hidden\\" facts; it is also to make these facts available to and palatable for the general public, this in order to facilitate understanding and catalyze citizens to express their understanding and render judgement at the voting booth. A few have succeeded brilliantly in this regard, effecting significant changes in public policy; Upton Sinclair comes to mind (20th century meat packing and food sanitation). Seymour Hirsch, by exposing My Lai and the depredations of US policy in Vietnam at least temporarily reigned in the military. Eric Schlosser joins this distinguished company with \\"Command and Control\\". While the book is long, he adds but few extra pages to a story of official policies, the nature of which simply strain credulity.  This book is, quite simply, a masterpiece of investigative reporting.<br /><br />The lack of probity shown by the US government has, yet again, been called to public attention by the startling revelations of Edward Snowden.  Despite a series of strikingly maladroit lies, self-serving half-truths, unique interpretations of commonly understood terms, inane platitudes, circumlocutions and outright lies, the government continues to deny the obvious: it has been caught in a series of uniquely damaging deceptions.  Just as with Snowden, Eric Schlosser has revealed another series of gross distortions and frank untruths, this time on a topic of life-and-death significance: the safety of the US stockpile of nuclear weapons and the grossly flawed command and control structure that both supervises their use and is responsible for their design and construction.<br /><br />The book is structured around one of a long series of grotesque errors in the storage and maintenance of nuclear weapons; the so-called, \\"Damascus Incident\\". Schlosser deftly incorporates this near catastrophic mishap involving an unstable, dangerous and obsolete land-based ICBM (a \\"Titan-II\\") into a tapestry of recurring myopic and self-deluding \\"execution paradigms\\", predictable errors and willful stupidity exercised at all levels of the US government. While the instigator was necessity (fear of a Nazi nuclear weapon); the expedient was political pandering (the usual \\"tough on Communism\\" canards and the \\"Soviet Menace\\"). The lubricant was inter-service military rivalries, a willingly \\"captive\\" scientific-industrial combine (Scandia, administered by ATT&T, for example) and suicidal reliance on a grossly oversimplified and unidimensional response to real and hypothetical Soviet military incursions. ppropriately known as \\"MAD\\" (Mutually Assured Destruction\\"). The author carefully and adroitly dismembers the entire \\"house of cards\\" of the SIOP (Single Integrated Operational Plan; tantamount to launch on warning) and he encyclopedically catalogues the nearly comical logic that went into its construction.<br /><br />The author presents a scrupulously balanced picture. He uses primary sources and makes every attempt at avoiding bias. To a great extent, he blames the US for perpetuating the arms race noting the fraudulent and sometimes silly justifications for building more armaments, newer ones all the while maintaining obsolete and dangerous weapons in the inventory.  Nonetheless, brinksmanship tactics were equally used by the US and USSR. Paradoxically, the command and control structure of the Soviet system appears more robust in Schlosser's analysis due to its centralized control and well-incorporated weapons interlock mechanisms. The extreme dangers of state secrecy are highlighted.  For example, the USSR's \\"dead man\\" PERIMETER computer-based launch network; this was a fail-safe system whose potentially reassuring existence was hidden from the US. Credulous disarmament advocates (including, surprisingly, Bertrand Russell) fall under the author's scrutiny, as well. The hubris of complex system designers is nicely and repeatedly addressed with a fine synopsis in the concluding chapter.<br /><br />Were but the events Schlosser details in \\"Command\\" a thing of the remote past, but that is hardly the case. MIRVed (Multiple Independently Targeted Re-Entry Vehicles) of megaton-multiple strength still sit astride SLBMs (Submarine Launched Ballistic Missles) and \\"upgrades\\" to existing inventory of older weapons systems is the plan du jour.  Recognizing the hypocrisy of the \\"Nuclear Club\\" members (the US paramount amongst them), other countries with less stable (?) leadership (Pakistan, North Korea, Iran) are now armed (or soon to be so). Proliferation and its attendant dangers are on the near- and far-term horizon. So too is the risk of categoric mishaps. Idealism aside, perhaps if the US had carefully deliberated matters in light of the mistakes Schlosser now makes public and studied the strategic implications of nuclear arms more diligently, the present problems could have been ameliorated or maybe avoided altogether. Perhaps not, as proving a counter-factual is impossible. Fortunately, Schlosser avoids speculation and Pollyanna-type platitudes on matters of this nature.<br /><br />Schlosser does display one minor narrative weakness: his depiction of the \\"ordinary\\" men who tend the bombs and man the bombers. Sometimes the representations appear fawning and the characters one-dimensional; Boy Scouts in Arms. Maybe that's the way they were and the quibble is a minor one, indeed. His depictions of some weapons scientists are occasionally heart-rending (for instance, Louis Slotin, a genuine \\"martyr for science\\"). When contrasted with the buffoonery of certain \\"Masters of War\\" (General Power, Curtis LeMay's martinet-acolyte immediately comes to mind), the human dimension of the tragedy is complete.<br /><br />All that's missing now is how this will end. If the \\"bad religion\\" of secrecy (the NSA surveillance debacle indicates this culture is alive and well) and the death wish associated with nuclear weapons depicted in \\"Command\\" are still current, then probabilities are, as Schlosser notes, that a major magnitude disaster looms.r.<br /><br />Were but the events Schlosser details in \\"Command\\" a thing of the remote past, but that is hardly the case.

B00EGMQIJ0|1.0|I could not agree more with Luke Miner's comments (\\"Know your material\\"). The editor should have caught the repeated mistakes of word choice. \\"Dissemble\\" is not a synonym for \\"disassemble\\" or \\"dismantle.\\" Using the word \\"ebullient\\" to describe someone's mood sounds absurd in someone's internal speech, unless that someone is named Safire or Buckley. Using \\"ebullient\\" once is forgivable, but doing it three times suggests it was learned while cramming for SATs and has been seeking an outlet ever since.  \\"Diffident\\" does not mean \\"difficult\\" or \\"disputatious.\\"  Nothing in this dull book required such precise words. Using such words when the writer clearly had something else in mind distracts the reader with thoughts about the writer's grasp of English. With the exception of plot (a rather slender one), all the elements of fiction are absent from this hopelessly overrated drivel. Characters are crudely drawn stick figures. The themes (e.g., tyranny of the majority) are interesting and timely, but they were trivialized by Eggers' ham handed, artless execution. The dialog is hopeless. The book is carried along exclusively by a single layer of plot, which unfortunately has all the appeal and nuance of a corporate PowerPoint. Some furtive, gratuitous sex is thrown in, but it is not erotic, interesting, or plausibly needed to support the plot or a theme. This kind of book makes one question the network of interests that promotes the publication and favorable reviews of books by popular writers. If you already bought the book, it may help pass the time on an airplane. But be sure to recycle it before you leave the airport. Abandonment on a convenient chair will work. If you haven't bought it, consider spending your scarce reading time on something worthwhile. \\"Command and Control\\" is a great choice. Unlike \\"The Circle,\\" it's well-written, well-researched, interesting, timely, and true.

B00846REIS|4.0|MY HEART IS FULL OF LOVE!!<br /><br />Bared to You brings us yet another billionaire – Gideon Cross, who falls for socialite Eva Tramel.  Eva has had a tough past at the hands of a step-brother and over-protective mother. This is the story many are saying is a Fifty Shades knock-off, and I completely disagree! Many believe that a likeness to Christian Grey developed once Ms. Day introduced us to Gideon Cross, and it is hard not to make the comparison. Gideon is mysterious, secretive and a bit unreadable which helps develop his and Eva’s story. The difference between the Crossfire series and Fifty Shades, is Eva has a backbone, a strong family presence, and is a career woman from the beginning. Without a doubt, Gideon and Eva's relationship is dysfunctional to say the least, but the story also delivers the perfect combination of sexual tension and passion. Bared to You has good details, the characters have some depth, and the minor storyline moves quickly. I like that Gideon did not play games – and was upfront about what he wanted from Eva, but hated all the running away from each other! I believe at times, there was almost too much conflict. The sex scene at his parents’ home (the garden party) was a bit of a turn-off. Overall what makes this book a little better than 50 Shades is the development of the secondary characters. I love Carey and want more of him! I also am interested in Eva’s boss and his partner. Overall, it was a quick read, and created enough interest to wait for the second book.

B00EY7LT9Q|5.0|Awesome spinoff from &#34;The Avengers&#34; movie!  Agent Coulson's miraculous survival is still a mystery, but and the hints/clues are confusing. He thinks he recovered in Tahiti under the hands of very good surgeons and physical therapists. The show also hints at how he has changed somewhat, especially in the last episode where one of the girls ask, &#34;Does he know?&#34;  And you go, &#34;Know what?!!&#34;  Tell us now!  Looking forward to the next episodes.  I hope it gets renewed, too.
0307341577|5.0|Full disclosure - listened to the unabridged audio version.<br /><br />AS with the other GF novels, the main character - and most of the others as well - is seriously flawed. I consider her novels to be a little weird and really off beat. Kinda wonder about the author.<br /><br />But I love the books, and this one was my favorite. Better than &#34;Gone Girl&#34; for me. Many times an author will get a good start on a book, but then can not pull off a satisfactory ending (like the WTF of &#34;Gone Girl&#34;). To me, this ending was most satisfactory even though part of it was a rabbit out of the hat.<br /><br />There are many turns a twists along the way, but they make complete sense. Don't want to get into the plot, as it is tempting to give too much away. I liked the skipping around in time, although that seems to be becoming common in novels. None of the characters are lovable - or even likeable - which could put some readers off.<br /><br />Anyway, I give it a five star rating and am hoping that Ms. Flynn continues to write books, as I am anxious to see what she can pull off next.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Pam Grout's writing style is almost too informal, and she tends to take all outside information as fact.  However, her informality and exuberance makes the experiments lively and fun.  I did all nine and seven worked.  The exercises are very easy and useful.  Definitely worth a try!<br /><br />I suggest you do each experiment individually, and don't read ahead.  I will note that the 'Abracadabra' experiment actually scared me because it worked so absurdly accurately.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|It's great when a book can take you back to your childhood. In this story, Gaiman finds moments of magic so compelling, it's like travelling back to the time when, as children, anything was possible. The mind of a child is so perfectly captured here, that even though my experience as a kid was completely different than these characters, I found myself identifying with then on a viceral level that is rare in fiction. By describing a world somehow so familiar, he lets us fill in the spaces - all he does is narrate, but that is more than enough. We are soon pulled completely into the ocean.
B002361MLA|4.0|This is a good book for those looking for a starting point on the Path.  I found the guide useful, but oversimplified.  However, Tolle's ardor and passion provides enough impetus to overcome the lack of deeper study.
B005LAII6C|4.0|ParaNorman Bowling for Movies Score: 224.438 of 300<br /><br />What is Bowling for Movies you might ask - it's a score that I, just your average dude, have come up with to rate and score movies.  I gotta lot time on my hands and I watch movies - many MANY movies.  Using the latest technology and a mixture of pseudo and quasi science, I have developed a formula (which literally has nothing to do with bowling) to capture the pure essence of Hollywood magic... displayed as a score ranging from 0 to 300.  A score of 108 would be a \\"just ok, not particularly good / bad\\" movie, where a score of 192 would tell you it was a very good movie.  Now, break 200 and you've got something really special.  Throw too many \\"gutterballs\\" will land you under 100 and well - you get the idea. :]<br /><br />ParaNorman - we own the Blu-ray 3D + Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy + UltraViolet copy (we like to have our bases covered HA!)<br /><br />Movie Explanation (no-there is too much, let me sum up):<br />A basically normal boy in a positively ordinary small town finds himself to be un-normal and the town in a positively unordinary situation... you see Norman can see and speak with the dead.  Yup, that's right he and his shirt size are the same - a medium!  As the town readies for its 300th anniversary Norman begins to be haunted by spooky visions making him the butt of the school's jokes and an easy target for the local bully, Alvin.  Finding keeping to himself to be less complicated, Norman attempts to be a lone wolf but fortunately the other schoolyard reject, Neil (a perpetual glass-half-full kind of guy, and frankly an inspiration to just being nice fanatics everywhere) befriends him and totally accepts Norman's \\"quirks\\".  As the story unfolds we learn that Norman isn't the only medium in the family - his \\"nutty\\" weird guy uncle has the gift and a dark secret about the local legend of the much celebrated witch's curse.  It seems generations of Norman's family have been keeping the dark magic of the witch at bay.  When his uncle suddenly dies, Norman must pick up the reins and help the town (which has done nothing but ridicule and make fun of him).  Will Norman and his band of misfit friends save the town and remove the curse forever????  Buy or rent this little gem of a flick to find out!<br /><br />What I loved:<br />~ What a wonderful blend of artistic expressions - CGI, sure, but also stop motion animation, and get this - they used an emerging technology to make the puppets - 3D printing, how cool is that?  The end product is seamless and beautiful.<br /><br />~ The script was a throw-back to earlier horror flicks and has some genuinely suspenseful and scary parts (a warning to parents with very young children, this might be a little too scary for little ones - we'd watch it first if Little Movie Dude was younger just to make sure it was ok).<br /><br />~ The 3D effects were well used and blended into the movie completely - I actually forgot it was in 3D as I was totally immersed into Norman's world.<br /><br />~ Positive messages abound: from Neil's ever-present positive spin and can do attitude, Norman's willingness to let by-gones-be-by-gones to save his home town, Norman's mother who always is the voice of reason and a grade \\"A\\" peacekeeper, and a touching moment with his ghost of a grandmother who offers kind words of encouragement in a moment of fear... wonderful!<br /><br />Hey, if you have a question about this review, feel free to leave a comment and I will try to answer promptly.

B003FNWR6Y|4.0|We love this game as much as the original... probably more.  The problem is that if everyone is purchasing houses, there are not enough!  We made due with putting  a hotel sideways.  Another option is to wad up little pieces of paper.  Still for the price they should put in enough houses.  We did purchase this two years ago so perhaps they have made changes since that time.

B005BZQVJ8|4.0|Paul is a really well done tale of a &#34;road trip&#34; by a couple of British guys out to see the Sci-Fi sights of America.  They get much more than they bargained for along the way, and the movie brings in some great bits from many beloved Sci-Fi movies.  Lots of humor, great casting and a fun script make it a must see for anyone who's ever enjoyed Science Fiction.

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I have to agree with so many other reviews, this is a great idea, but is still a Beta version implementation.<br />It intermittently drops connections to your source machine, and takes several steps to reconnect.<br />The content can come only from Chrome Browser, although the way it passes off Netflix, YouTube, and Hulu URIs directly to the device is a good approach and seems to work well. It will still stutter and pause on some streaming content.<br /><br />I was largely interested in using it for meetings and presentations, but it still requires some local WiFi setup, although not too much. When sending PowerPoint presentations, I could not find any way t o have it shown in regular full-screen mode, it always keeps the slide index on the left as one would do during development. (There are workarounds, converting to full-screen locally, and using a different display mode, but the standard &#34;casting&#34; mode should work better.)<br /><br />But overall it also has limited content sources - for example who wants to subscribe to Hulu and pay to watch commercials?<br />I look forward to when this develops into its full potential - the idea is a great one!
B00471TLZS|5.0|I love this movie and can't believe more TV stations do not play it, especially around Halloween. So it was time for me to own my own copy. This movie is the perfect combination of things that go bump in the night and a little blood and gore. The slasher movie like Halloween and Jason just don't come close.
B00D6QUMWG|3.0|Anna Netrebko brings her artistry to bear on Verdi in this album of Verdi arias.  It's an interesting listen for anyone who is a fan of Netrebko, but I found myself more excited for the orchestra's reading of Verdi's scores than from the singing itself.  The rich nuances of Verdi's music shine through in the brisk tempi and colorful renderings of the Orchestra del Teatro Regio di Torino.<br /><br />The close mic'ing of Lady Macbeth's opening dialogue was very close at the beginning, but warmed a bit in the subsequent aria.  Netrebko's chromatics are a bit unruly in the opening music, perhaps owing to the fact that she is attempting to demonstrate a darker color in her voice, which may rob her of the flexibility of these passages.  The orchestra plays wonderful well, giving life to much of the scene.  One often does long for a 'chestier' approach in some of the lower passages to give a more menacing characterization, but Netrebko is able to infuse the vocal lines with much drama.  I found the portamenti on the \\"Qui? qui?\\" in the tempo di mezzo a bit overdone, and not true to Verdi style, but this is picking nits.  One occasionally has the sense that she won't quite make the sostenuto notes in upper pitches, but she arrives, usually with a bit of pitch bending into the top voice. In the \\"Merce, dilette amiche\\"  we get a darker timbre but lose in the finesse of smaller, more decorative phrases; her acciacature are often glossed over, and chromatic passages lack a certain clarity and neatness.<br /><br />It's an album I would like to have enjoyed more. But fans of Netrebko will surely want this album of arias as an account of her foray into Verdi.

B001TM14VC|3.0|So, I loved this movie when I was a kid and now that I'm an adult, I still love this movie but it really is not a good movie.  Let's be honest, stock 80's dialogue, Tom Cruise doing his 80's Tom Cruise thing, playing on the cold war which was such a big deal back then as well.  It was excellent popcorn fodder back in the day and is still a good watch when I don't need to think to any capacity.  I do have to say, however, the cinematography is fantastic and the air battles and dog fights are absolutely top notch.  Not a film since has caught this sort of thing(Iron Eagle movies were a joke) but the directors and actors truly went full out to make the flight stuff appear real.  Long live the 80's for the great mindless movies they created, this once will always have a special place in my heart!

B000002H38|5.0|LADY ANITA BAKER is without a single speck of doubt one of, or perhaps the greatest female singer to grace this planet. She is indeed in possession of a heavenly voice on the Earth, a gift from GOD himself!!.<br />Her voice is so mature, so sultry, so sophisticated, so smooth and mellow, so sad and so beautiful with a stunning range all in one. This classy voice easily pass right through your body, takes root in your soul and somehow become part of your very essence.<br />ANITA BAKER is my absolute favorite lady singer. To me, she is the female version of MR LUTHER VANDROSS.<br />I own all her albums, which are all truly excellent but \\"RAPTURE\\" is beyond excellent!!. So wonderfully crafted. Every song a perfect package in every sense of the word. With a fusion of deep R&B and sold jazz,  I know \\"RAPTURE\\" is one of the most important albums ever recorded.<br /><br />This supremely classic recording begins with the jazzy \\"SWEET LOVE\\", it just takes you away..a real work of art. Next is \\"YOU BRING ME JOY\\" is simply amazing , her vocal range is showcased here. Then comes the title tract..\\"RAPTURE\\", mayhaps her single greatest effort, this song could not be better, I love it, cross my heart, my favorite ANITA BAKER song. \\"RAPTURE\\" is indeed a timeless classic.  Following is the beautiful yet melancholy \\"BEEN SO LONG\\", another favorite. \\"MYSTERY\\" is just as good as it gets too, a fantastic, gloomy record. Now things gets a little livelier with the breezy \\"NO ONE IN THE WORLD\\". \\"SAME OLE LOVE\\" is the most lively song on this album, wow! it's in a class by itself, this is simply just great music, another loved piece.<br />\\"WATCH YOUR STEP\\" finishes this project, a firm warning to a real disrespectful partner, lively arranged, a class act. Although only eight songs, the treat is immeasurably mesmerizing, \\"RAPTURE\\" is worth more than most other albums combined.<br /><br />I proudly,highly recommend the now classic \\"RAPTURE\\" to all who truly loves sophisticated SOUL recordings because this is indeed a priceless treasure worth holding on to.because this is indeed a priceless treasure worth holding on to.

B007VDN1PA|5.0|Good product for the price, easy to use.  Very happy with the quality of the pictures I scanned. I am very satisfied with this purchase.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been playing Candy Crush Saga on Facebook but I think this app is better. You can actually use your gift lives! The Kindle seems to be the perfect size for playing.
B00499QUK2|5.0|I really didn't know what to expect.  I was blown away by the great characters.  Benedict Cumberbatch is an amazing Sherlock.  I finally got my husband to watch and he is hooked!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game is a lot of fun but I wish someone who was putting the games on the store would put on the game hay day
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Lots of fun but easy to lose track of time....can be frustrating and a challenge on certain levels.  Love it!
B001HBYHFA|4.0|If you like Firefly, you'll love this movie. And you don't have to have seen Firefly to follow this movie
B007ME5BUG|5.0|This has been the finest novel of WW2 that I've ever read and definitely increased my understanding of this devastating, horrific world wide conflict.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|I have been catching up on all of the Sons of Anarchy seasons and like this show a lot! This season is super violent, I can with less of that.
B00BAXFAOW|2.0|I've read all his other books and they were all page turners, however, I really struggled to read this one. The main point and the stories used just didn't reinforce each other. As for the stories, they just seemed like random anecdotes stretched to try and make his points stand.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It's not nearly the same as AppleTV. I was really hoping you could natively mirror screens with this, but it's limited to only Chrome webpage and some select apps, like YouTube and Netflix. If something doesn't offer the mirroring, it just doesn't work. So you can't simply mirror everything your phone/laptop does which was annoying. I guess enough into it or my hopes were too high.<br /><br />On top of that, there are no real directions explaining all that to you. If you go in with the expectation of AppleTV style mirroring, you'll be really confused.<br /><br />However, it does do what it's supposed to. The picture of Chrome pages works... the audio works.. etc. It'll probably better in a year or two. As of now, I'd personally return it because the AppleTV is far superior as of this moment.
B003F3PMYI|5.0|This book struck for me a great balance in terms of backing up recommendations based on the research around happiness. I'd say it gives a clear roadmap of exercises and other actions that you can apply to make your life happier. Having read a number of other books around the psychology of happiness, this one is an excellent round up of the key research and puts forward and actionable framework from this. Doesn't get too academic either.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|When this came out, I was so excited by the product, that I signed up for a wait list.  I thought this would revolutionize tv watching ( from someone that is actively trying to ditch cable).<br /><br />So when I got this, it was as easy to set up as everyone said. plug and play.<br /><br />However, one thing I felt that many people failed to mention was the lack of usage of this product through Aps.  At least with the apple Ap for the chromecast, there are ONLY TWO sites you can play content from ( you tube, and Netflix I beleive).  I don't know if the android aps are any better, but from my perspective, if I can only play stuff from two sites through the ap - what's the point??  I expected to be able to load free episodes of network tv on there, link to video streaming sites, and basically use this to watch any video content i would find online.  Of course you can go get your laptop, boot it up, go to the regular webpage, and play video content from there that streams to your tv through the chromecast.  but if i'm going through all that trouble, I would have just connected the laptop to the tv via hdmi cables??<br /><br />I suspect the ap and usability will improve, so i'm still keeping the product - I just am not really wow'd by it now.
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|Nice game but to obtain the different levels to get the gold to keep shooting takes too long as a result it gets frustrating so I sometimes dont bother to play.
B007HVBW2A|4.0|After all these years and so much competition in the horror movie category,<br />The Exorcist is one of the most entertaining-hair raising movie classics.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so happy to have Candy Crush on my Kindle Fire. It is one of my favorite games with many challenging levels.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|I really liked this book and thought it was a great finale to the series. Obviously no sequel could ever match the original intensity of the Maze Runner, but I was genuinely pleased with the outcome. Especially the end!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Fun, but once advancing in the game , really hard to level up....found other exciting games to play on my Kindle
B00E9P957Q|3.0|Although I did not expect an abundance of extras, the only album credits are for Vapor Trails remixed. A big cheesy book with all the albums' lyrics in ONE font, so it's like they're from the same album. It met my purpose for buying it, to have new cd copies of the albums, but this is nowhere near the geekability of the Sectors box sets. The remastering is decent, with roll The Bones getting the most improvement. An album like Counterparts is already so punchy and crystal clear that it was not needed, but it sounds like it had a light refreshing anyway...sounds great. Carve Away The Stone has the whispered 'sisyphus' removed like in the previous Atlantic reissue, which sucks if you are a completest like me, which is why I even bought it. So get this if you want to have a 'Sector 4', just don't expect stuff like album credits.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|We are extremely glad that we bought this. No more hooking up the laptop to the T.V. Works well with Casting the tab from a PC.<br /><br />Only issue that we notice is that we cannot use Iphone or Ipad to cast the tab from Chrome.<br /><br />Would recommend this product.
B006JRY2QG|5.0|One of those series that you can't stop watching! There is never an obvious conclusion at the end of an episode.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I really like this story...The first two books read fast!!!!! ---The third book took a little while to get into..with the story changing to a dual narrative..but after a while read smooth.<br />I liked the evolution of  Four, \\"I have always hated the emptiness that winter brings,\\"<br />I know the writer had to have reasons about when to change the point of view...but given that the first two books were only from a single narrative.....It may have been better to switch later in the story (After the Climax).....Still good though.
B005V5WBFG|1.0|waste of time. didn't really do anything and just kept running in the background.<br />I then had my email box blown up with tons of spam from their company.<br />plus it kept wanting me to back up my kindle dont waste your time.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I was expecting the same great storyline that was present in the first two books.  This book is very flat and boring.  Introducing a new setting and storyline was not the right move.  Disappointed with this book.
B005HEDI3K|5.0|It's the original Star Trek at its best. Watching this in HD brings the series that much more fun. An outstanding view
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I was told about an update but didn't have net for some time. I went in to save one of my settlers only to see a movie sequence. The entire game reset on me without warning. I will never play this game again. It has reset 4 times do far and I have lost everything I have done.
B003G8Y4QO|4.0|All of the new Doctor Who series are fun. This is a slight drop off from the 10th doctors last series but fun
1608836053|5.0|The first season of Downton Abbey was intriguing and certainly made me want to watch season two.  The character development of season two is fascinating.  Keep watching!  This is a well crafted tale.
B003NRYMZQ|4.0|Nice Dr. who spinoff I think the first two seasons rocked. I wish they woukd bring this show and team back. I miss my Captain Jack
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The story grabs you right from the beginning and all the way through EXCEPT for the end. It was disappointing to me. I was hoping to &#34;feel good&#34; at the end, but alas, I was not... It left the other books a &#34;wish I hadn't read them&#34; feeling. Sad, so sad...<br /><br />There was a little satisfaction in what she did at the end, but it left me feeling empty like an unfinished story...
1781162646|5.0|Undeniable some of King's best writing of late.<br />I have most of his books and this will be one of my favorite re-reads!
B009H7SCMA|4.0|I really enjoyed this tongue-in-cheek (and several other places!) story.<br /><br />The main character Gabriella is a gorgeous private school girl, who I admit took a while to warm up to.  She's perfectly shaped, blonde, and walks around looking down on the world with a vehemence that is unrivaled.  Her sexual antics are a reflection of what she believes she should do because she is one of the pretty people.  Being rich and privileged makes her behave in a manner that could be described as horrible mostly because she can get away with it.<br /><br />That attitude of entitlement carries Gabriella through the first couple chapters of the book, until she has a liaison with Jim, one of the lower class boys at the cricket match.  He's the epitome of what she finds disgusting in the world - poor, ill-mannered, and not overly impressed with her social power.<br /><br />Through a series of naughty encounters, Gabriella is changed by Jim.  She matures as a character in a most appealing way.  I found myself reluctantly liking her by the end of the book.  The love story that seems to come out of nowhere between Jim and Gabriella is refreshing and sweet in a way that I had not thought possible at the start of the book.
B00F87ZUYG|3.0|It's fallen off in quality. But I still love zombies! There's still time for the show runners to right the ship. Though I am not hopeful.
B00FRBMA8W|4.0|Wow, what a collection!<br /><br />I am not usually a fan of short stories.  They often feel incomplete.  But not so with these from Sonya Dodd.  From a bank robbery to an unusual take on Shakespeare's work of \\"Hamlet\\", these stories are fresh and exciting.  Several of them I read multiple times, going back over and savoring the relationships portrayed and the characters shared.<br /><br />I found the stories to be full of wisdom and wit, showing an understanding of the human heart that really impressed me.  I loved the writing, I enjoyed the glimpses into these lives and I will be looking for other works by this author.
B002QYSZBO|1.0|Too much sarcasm, not enough story.  I had high hopes, but the film failed to deliver.  The acting performances were uninspiring.
B00499QUK2|5.0|I grew up reading Sherlock Holmes and watching the films and television series. This version is done fantastically and the modernization that's been done is believable.The writing is superb and the dialogue between Sherlock and Dr. Watson is clever and funny. The twists and turns throughout each episode's plot are some of the most creative and ingenious I can remember seeing in any film or show lately. The show is engaging and if you aren't paying attention, you will miss something. The actors who play Sherlock and Dr. Watson do a brilliant job. They work very well together and play off each other beautifully. I only wish there were more episodes in a season and a shorter time to wait between seasons!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Just watch it. Here are a few more words to add to my review. If you watch it, you will probably like it. Turn on your TV too.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love downton abbey and can't wait for season 4 to come out. I have flown through seasons 1-3.  So much happens in this season.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I have to say again, I love it.  It is part of the Masterpiece series for good reason. Remember to turn on your TV now to watch
B00BTZNEN0|5.0|Over the last decade, I've found the music being promoted to be nauseating.  This album is a breath of fresh air.  The beats make you feel good, and I can easily see this album being a great crowd pleaser in a concert setting.  Each song has a great harmony, and the slow songs just transport you to a peaceful place.  The song \\"Au Revoir,\\" could have gone on another 15 minutes and I would have been very happy.  I am really enjoying the folk-inspired songs of Eric Hutchinson, OneRepublic, Mumford & Sons, and a few others that are not following the R&B-heavy albums of the previous decade.  The first few years of each new decade has some sort of alternative sound that defines it.  The early 90s had Nirvana, the early part of the 2000s had synth pop, and it looks like the early part of this decade is folk-inspired music, and I am fine with that.<br /><br />My favorites are \\"Counting Stars,\\" \\"If I Lose Myself,\\" \\"Feel Again,\\" \\"Preacher,\\" \\"Something I Need,\\" and \\"Au Revoir.\\"  I recommend purchasing this album, and if you are heading on a road trip, then start at song one and enjoy the whole album!
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|So fun to play and lose time with!  My son loves this game and has killed my battery more times than not while playing this game.  :)
B00942G4UA|5.0|Really interesting movie it kept us interested and it opened our eyes on many inportant matters. You have to watch it...
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|I can't really say I hated the game itself, because I never got to play it.  The game loaded onto my Kindle fine, but then would not open and then when I reloaded it opened but wouldn't play.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game. So glad it finally came to the kindle. This game is so addictive. I just hope I can complete the game without facebook because I don't have nor want facebook. I'll just keep playing sad long as I can.
B007N85POS|5.0|I got this game on my Kindle because my son is just addicted to these little Angry Birds.  I too enjoyed this game with the Rio twist/theme to it.  It is fun to see them fly through the air and into the things and the little birds in the cages get out.
B0038OY6DW|5.0|I have been waiting to see this movie for sometime, and I was thrilled with every part.  The quality was great, and the special price from Amazon Prime was a bonus.  Can't wait to see the sequel.  Robert Downey and Jude Law really pulled off a great caper here.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|So fun to play and lose time with!  My son loves this game and has killed my battery more times than not while playing this game.  :)
B00BEIYMTW|5.0|Somerhing for everyone. Took our 5 younger kids and here's the breakdown: preschoolers loved watching plane animation. Middle kids laughed at all the right parts. And as a parent, I appreciated the nod to Top Gun (which surprisingly no one has mentioned) with Goose and Iceman as Bravo and Echo.  That alone was reason enough to see it!  So everyone went home entertained and happy.  It may not win any official award but we liked it and will add it to our collection when it comes out on blu ray.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|The gameplay is amusing, but there are a large number of artificial roadblocks that will force you to stop playing for long amounts of real time unless you spend considerable amounts of money or clog your friends facebook feeds
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy to be able to get to the &quot;store&quot; to buy special items if I want to thank you so much Amazon love love love this game no glitches so far<br />Wish I could . Leave this review :(
B003DXSXCI|3.0|Good ole movie no special affects like we have today movies !! Great car no nno plastic parts to crack.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Fun game I have had this app for over a year and still enjoy playing it.  I have even restarted the levels and still enjoy it
0684857219|4.0|I had been going to the gym for a while through college just going through the motions not really knowing too much about the lifts I was performing. Reading through this book gave me a make better insight into not just lifting, but BODYBUILDING. It's incredible the things Arnold talks about and discusses, this is a great book to have especially for beginners as it lays out a good starting foundation and provides plenty of information on lifts and other various things.
0486474917|5.0|I only got around to reading Sherlock Holmes this year, despite it being a classic must-read. I only really knew Holmes by the campy movies, with his silly hat, tweed coat and magnifying glass. It wasn't until the movies starring Robert Downey Jr came out that I began to gain interest. I watched the first film, and was surprised by how engaging it was. Then the second came out, and became one of my favorite movies. I started looking for new things involving Sherlock Holmes, and I realized...I had never read any of the books. So I picked up the book, read the first story, and fell in love.<br /><br />  Unlike many books written at the time, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes is concise, and doesn't drag on with unnecessary explanation and exposition. Since it's a collection of short stories, that makes sense, but it's impressive nonetheless. The characters are interesting and mysterious, despite some of the clients being a bit similar to one another. The cases themselves are extremely creative, and though their conclusions may often be somewhat anti-climactic, they are almost always gripping, and make you unwilling to put it down.<br /><br />  To those of you looking for a good mystery...SHERLOCK HOLMES IS NOT A MYSTERY BOOK. He solves mysteries, yes. But the book often withholds information until the end, making it impossible for the readers to solve. This is deliberate of course, it makes it so that even readers with shrewd deductive skill can marvel at Sherlock's abilities. It didn't bother me, but it may be disappointing to some.
0694003611|5.0|I read this to my son and now I am reading it to my grandsons.  It is a must have book.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Can't wait the 2 years for Avengers 2 to come out! Great cast and story! Follows the comic series from the 60's! Very well done!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is addicting, frustrating and FUN.  It is a love-hate relationship.  Once you start playing, it is hard to put it down.
B00594XOZU|1.0|i logged out of my kik.....nd tryed to log back in but it said its an error has occured nd it wouldn't even let me make a new one..my advice to u is to go.to ur search engine nd type in aptiode...click on.the link .then its going to bring u to.ur settings...make.sure ur.settings say that u can download from unknown sources......once its downloaded...go to the search box in aptiode nd type in kik...nd u install it...make sure to delete ur old kik app
B00BE97ONM|5.0|REVIEW- By Melody Dempsey<br /><br />  SON OF A SERIAL KILLER.<br /><br />  Son of a Serial killer is an edge of your seat thriller!  This novel is VERY hard to put down!  James takes your breath away with this action packed, emotional, thriller. This story of intrigue, mystery, murder, and yes, sex, sometimes very hot and steamy, has all of the elements of a great novel. The main character, Ben, who is a kind man, has a very dark secret.  His life seems to spiral down after the death of his beloved father. This novel has plenty of twist and turns that are jaw dropping!  I put this wonderful author, James Ross right up there with Stephen King, Dean Koons, James Patterson, Mary Higgins Clark and Tina Wainscot!  Son of a Serial Killer is a MUST read<br /><br />[[ASIN:1599552388 Shattered Silence: The Untold Story of a Serial Killer's Daughter]]
B00F3W9NQ2|5.0|Great show with twists and turns and emotional ups and downs !  Don't start watching if you don't have time because you'll be hooked.
B00A9X9VAI|5.0|This movie did not disappoint, action packed, adventurous, loving, just an all around great movie; the actors were so believable and didn't disappoint either.
B000009ED0|4.0|Oldschool Kidrock. I got exactly what I was looking for. Either you know then album or you don't. Kidrock son.
B004EI3ON4|5.0|You can feel the Tron world inside of you, its state...desolate, lost, epic, and yet still hopeful . . .
B003L20IJM|5.0|Love her movies....wish there were more! My daughter loves to watch them over and over again. Good learning tool for her and me! Fast shipping!
1451695195|1.0|This book is a complete hoax. It's not biblical and so far out there I don't understand why people believe this man. It certainly has brought him fame and fortune. Aside from all that...the book is tedious and annoying.
B00C81LYH2|5.0|Every year I buy the new Holiday Barbie for my niece. This one looks even more stunning than last year!
B0089LOG02|5.0|Did not want it to end!  If you've never known of the orphan trains and you want to learn about them through example rather than just the cold, hard facts, this is a story that puts them in perspective, while shedding light on our still existing problem of abandoned or orphaned children of today.  Well written...a beautiful story!!!
B002OMZTSK|5.0|This is an excellent read that deals with modern problems of high school adolescents concerning social acceptance and love from an LGBT perspective!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I wasn't sure if I would like this show, but ending up getting totally drawn in and now i watch it as much as I can!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|spoilers ahead.<br /><br />I know some people really hated the ending but I honestly think it was the only thing that was worth reading in this entire book. It was monotone. It was mostly boring. The major reveals of the world beyond the fence had no impact. There was no tension between Four and Tris - I didn't believe they were crazy in love at all, there was just a lot of kissing. This book also revealed horrendous plot holes - I'm willing to forgive most plot holes in YA books but in this case I kept thinking: \\"this is so stupid\\". If you're trying to have a society that keeps reproducing in order to create GPs, why would you ever give them guns or death serum? honestly. How did Tris pushing that button make everyone infected with the memory serum? Was it in the vents? How would erasing their memory create any impact in the society if they are only a division of the government?<br /><br />But my biggest problem with the book was the alternating POVs. How can you have two POVs that sound like the same exact person? I didn't believe that was Four's internal voice at all. Instead of enhancing the story, it felt forced. At least in the end, Tris actually acted like Tris - even if her sacrifice seems like it was for a completely stupid reason. I don't see how else she could've ended the series.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|great game  My children love this game.  thanks keep up the good work on these great games.  Love it!  Keep these games coming.
B00APKIN1I|4.0|I loved the movie and the songs that were played with everyone so I wanted the soundtrack. It's great music..
142311339X|5.0|reason why i gave it five stars is cause it is a part of an amazing series. it doesn't drag on, there's humor, and a good plot. if you haven't read the percy jackson and the olympians series then i would definitely suggest you do cause they go hand in hand and that way you can get to know some of the main characters back stories
B00B4BJY7E|3.0|I bought this for a budget gaming rig (believe it or not). This is NOT a gaming processor. CPU mark puts it close to my old C2D so I thought it would get me by with my GTX 660 Ti until I could afford another one. It does get me by. I am able to play my games on high settings for the most part. This is a great, cheap processor for a budget / general use computer, but go with the i5 for games.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Everyone wants to feel loved, but who really understands that each of us has our own love language.  This book will open your  mind!
159463176X|5.0|The style of Husseini is similar to that of the other books of same author.<br />The reading is valid as approach to many questions of the social revolutions, but also we observe a particular attention to style questions.<br />The men which about Hosseini talks live in the traditional world, but they don't refuse to relating theirself to the globalization which about Baumann speaks.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I chose this rating because the book was well written and I could not put it down.  Very good read!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My wife kept telling me to get Candy Crush. I kept telling her they don't have it for Kindle and then all of a sudden, there it is and I enjoy it almost a  much as she does. It os rather addicting, but on a good way.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I love most Stephen King books and this was no exception.  It isn't one of his tomes that take forever to finish. Sleep Doctor tells the story of what happened to the little boy who was the caretaker's son in King's earlier novel, The Shining, while weaving in a new story non-humans.  It made me want to re-read The Shining since it's been many years since that one was released.
0788859544|5.0|It was wonderful! Clear and excellent! My granddaughter will no doubt love it as much as her mother did! Thank you!
B000002UB3|5.0|I grew up listening to this album, and some of the songs are very kid-friendly if you ask me- at least in style (Maxwell's Silver Hammer despite its violent themes it is fun; and Octopus' Garden, for example). Regardless, I may be biased but this album is a great listen, and an iconic one for The Beatles in many ways. Highly recommended for fans of rock music and music history especially.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I'm had this app on my phone; however. I had tried earlier to put it on my kindle. It didn't work for KINDLE, two many steps. But now so far so good...I'm enjoying CCS so far. THANKS... I gave it 4 stars , no thing's perfect, always room for improvement.....NO BUGS YET..
0446530573|5.0|I had originally purchased this for my father, as he used to be the head chef and owner of an Italian restaurant, and also his favorite show was The Sopranos. We have tried most of the of the recipes- delicious! Of course my dad will improv himself here and there, but I have followed a few to the letter and have been nothing but pleased. I also like the additional content. That's what makes a cookbook special to me, especially in this day when you can find thousands of recipes on a single website.
0525478817|5.0|Touching, emotionally charged.  Excellent read for older teens and adults.  Life at it's best and worse all rolled into one.
B000002UAX|5.0|The White Album is a classic album, and one of the Beatles' finest works. Two CDs full of great songs and classic hits, my personal favorites being &#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; and &#34;Back in the U.S.S.R.&#34; Other classics include &#34;Dear Prudence,&#34; &#34;While My Guitar Gently Weeps,&#34; &#34;Blackbird,&#34; and &#34;Revolution 1.&#34; One of the greatest albums of all time (Listed at #10 on Rolling Stone's &#34;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&#34;), this album is a must-have, especially for music aficionados.
B00FEHXCIG|2.0|I enjoyed both of the previous Iron man movies, but this one just lacked. It had a couple solid moments and Guy Pearce as well as Ben Kingsly were both nice addititons to the cast.
B00FJTYDKK|4.0|The Croods is a movie about the adventures of a caveman family, after their cave is destroyed, must trek through an unfamiliar world with the help of an inventive boy.<br /><br />This movie is good clean family fun with some laughs and has something for both adults and kids. The humor is clean and very funny at times and has a good story. If you like The Incredibles or other similar type stories and animation then your family will enjoy this.<br /><br />Good animation and good voice acting make this a solid movie to watch that I enjoyed very much.
B00FPH6AXE|2.0|I'm going to keep this short. Will Smith actually performed, the special effects and general cinematography were on par, but his son sucks at acting. I never saw the most recent installment of the karate kid, but this was enough Jaden for me to know he sucks.
B009346RSS|5.0|Purchased because stupid Panasonic doesn't include headphone jacks on their plasma displays in US. I didn't even think about it before I purchased the TV because how can a top of the line plasma like they are making not include such a feature. Well this thing works great just plug it into one of the TV USB ports for power and coil up a huge optical cable because they don't seem to make 6 inch ones and you are good to go. Two points I would make. Manufacturer notes it is not intended for use with headphones because it has no volume adjustment and will not adjust with TV volume as usually optical is just a pass-through. I ignored this because I am using Bluetooth headphones with their own volume adjust but based on volume levels I got off of the PS3 this could definitely be a problem if you didn't have something. Remember it will only convert PCM if you input anything that needs decoding it is a no go. Just set your sources accordingly.
B00DHNAQ2Y|5.0|I love being terrified, horrified, and to some degree disgusted. This movie hit all the right notes. Minor flaws, but basically a perfect horror movie.
1476727651|5.0|Dr Sleep is a great sequel to the Shining.  A lovely creepy tale of what has become of Danny&#34;s life post The Overlook.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|If you or your children like Star Trek, then this movie is the ticket to hours of family fun and entertainment!
1781162646|5.0|Curious case + meddling kids + a dog + a trapped ghost+ a little shine= Justice for victims of a serial killer.
B0039Q7QKE|5.0|Good item for Star Trek fun- is made of heavier duty metal and is true to the original design. Would recommend.
B00DGGIXS6|3.0|Cher is sounding as good as ever, however, I am not a fan of hi-energy techno music. I think she shines on the mid tempo songs.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|My son had a Star Trek party and they spent hours watching this collection. Great item! Would recommend to others-fun!
B002P4VUMQ|5.0|This cd I have in my collection and I recently gave it as a gift because I love to share good music. If you enjoy good singing, good showmanship and good songs, this cd/dvd will do the trick.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Kids love this movie and have their own Star Trek parties- great item and shipped quickly- will consider more purchases in the future
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love playing very hard to put down a good one for the entire fAmily to play happy finally able to play on my kindle
B00992CF6W|5.0|Mindcraft is ausom!but I wish that there was more things like endermen and zombie eggs on creative mode that would be really cool!if can't seem to get a update though
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This is one of the most awesome gun apps I have ever played it is really realistic  and fun to play
B00CKH9WOQ|5.0|Will buy again.  A bit scary but my daughter loves it.  Currently looking for more.  I don't like hanging to answer all of these questions just to do a review.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|it a great fame to play i play it all day long  at work and at home so yeah its asome game
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Great book, so much better than the show. Vi suggest for anyone to read it. You won't regret reading it.
B00EQ0CKRQ|4.0|This game is tons of fun ,great graphics nice scenery.  Only problem is going online. Please help solve that problem.
B009LGO88E|5.0|The circle pad pro is a must have peripheral for the 3DS and XL and it works like a charm.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The software is still a bit ropy, it regularly loses sync with the Chromecast.  But the major problem is Google's kowtowing to the legacy media regarding the difference between Chromecast and an HDMI cable.  Nobody limits the functionality of the cable, but Google appears willing to compromise the user experience in order to placate their new content friends.  Shabby.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I hadn't read a thriller in a while and when Into the Darkest Corner popped up as a daily deal, I grabbed it.  I am so glad I did.<br /><br />The story is told in alternating chapters.  You start out in 2003 with Catherine a young, vivacious, party going girl.  Then the next chapter is Cathy in 2007, a terrified woman with OCD who must check and recheck all the doors and windows and locks multiple times before she feels safe.<br /><br />I'm not going to admit how long it was before I figured out that they were the same woman!  Not too far in, but far enough!  Since that is the description of the book, I am not giving anything away (it's just that I didn't read the description before reading it).<br /><br />The author very successfully pulls off the two time periods.  You read through 2003 and 2004 watching and waiting for whatever caused her to completely fall apart by 2008.  You know it has something to do with her boyfriend Lee, and you watch the relationship change and deteriorate.  All the while, you are following her life in 2008 as she tries to get back to normal.<br /><br />A great page turner, kept me reading way past my bedtime.
0316055433|5.0|The Goldfinch is a long (but wonderful) story of loss, love, friendship and coming of age.  The protagonist is Theo Decker, and the book follows him from age 12 into his 20's.  I don't write spoiler reviews, so I will not describe the plot of this masterpiece other than to say that the art world figures prominently, so much so that a painting might be considered a second protagonist of sorts.  I bought this book for 2 friends before I was even halfway through it -- it is that good.
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|Sometimes before I review a book, I read other reviews.  I just want to glimpse if others loved it or hated it as much as I did.  What I noticed on the reviews of The Circle, is that it seems as if it is a very polarizing book, you either loved it or you hated it.<br /><br />I was one that loved it.<br /><br />It is the story of Mae, who finds herself with a job at The Circle.  The big, internet conglomerate ( sort of blend of Google, Facebook, Twitter and other internet bigwigs) that is set to pretty much take over the world.  As Mae enters into the world of constant sharing, constant feedback, constant immediate contact, she is slowly brought over to the dark side.<br /><br />Is it crazy over the top?  Yes.  The things the characters say, especially those of the higher ups and the overly zealous, always sounded like the voice of Hal from 2001 A Space Odyssey in my head.  You can't help but draw parallels with the warning tone of George Orwell's 1984. What are the consequences of putting too much of ourselves out there?  What will happen to privacy as we continue to blur the lines of what is off-limits?<br /><br />I read this exactly as I read a thriller, it was hard to put down.  I anticipated each new outrageous reach of The Circle.  I paused to contemplate my internet activity, which at times feels like the job that Mae makes it out to be.  With a blog and a business that I market on the internet, I have to maintain a regular presence, must get in the right amount of likes, and comments, and favorites.  At what point are we so busy sharing things on the internet, that the sharing becomes are goal, and not the experience itself?
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|and it doesn't matter if you remember the entire story of The Shining.  Doctor Sleep is immensely satisfying, Stephen King is the best!
B003730LRY|4.0|Such a great and fun movie.  My four and eight year old enjoyed it very much.  It was scary but not it a gross way.  Highly entertaining for kids of all ages.
B003JTHXN6|3.0|I'm tired of writing the same thing for several gifts that I have sent to this person. I cannot evaluate the items.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Great little device. Netflix and youtube streaming are high quality and easy to use. Can't wait until more functionality is added.
0385537131|5.0|This is the best book Grisham ever wrote. I have read them all. You really get your money's worth. It has a lot of pages filled with action. Loved, loved it.
1451666179|5.0|Allie Brosh is a hero to all of us who have trouble going outside, answering the phone, or understanding feelings. If you have seen her blog, you know what to expect. The book takes some of her best and most important work and mixes it with some new material. She is an inspiration because she writes from the depths of depression. She hasn't conquered it and may not. She writes while in the trenches, not looking back afterwards. This book made me understand myself better. I tore through the whole thing in a few hours after it was delivered. The people in the apartment next door must think I am crazy because of how hard I was laughing from the very first page. Buy this book so Allie never has to worry about adult responsibilities of going to work again! Also, it will make your life much better.
B001DPC52C|5.0|I love this band.  This CD has both the full performance on DVD and a more limited CD.  Both are excellent quality.
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|I really enjoyed this film. It is classic Tarantino. Really well made (in Louisiana) and edited. I was excited to watch it and I am excited to watch it again soon. A must-see.
B00BMNM4H6|4.0|A more apt name for the game could be Sort Sugar. The object is to divert the sugar, as it is being poured, into cups. As it gets more challenging, you are asked to get different colored sugar into its corresponding cup. It is fun, but it gets a bit too complicated after a while. I enjoy playing games while waiting for doctors, wife, friends, etc, and I find it is a whole lot easier to play the mindless stuff during those periods. I can't not recommend this for people who enjoy the challenge; it isn't bad. I just don't find it is first on my play list now that I have gotten mid-way through it.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|I love Allie! This is a great compilation of old and new material. I highly recommend it to anyone who would like to laugh hysterically. I don't recommend reading this at work!!
B00CO4KGYA|5.0|This game is in the mold of Angry Birds. Instead though, you are required to hit &#34;angry guys&#34; with your tennis ball and save the world from Explodz soft drink company. They make each level more challenging than the next by placing shields or hazardous waste suits on your enemy. I have found that it has replayability. I like to go back and redo levels to see if I can up my score. This game is worth the money if you like these types of games.
B003KVNV4S|5.0|This is my first National album and I recognize it as different from their previous music, more private but definitely ready for a large audience.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|I really enjoy Monkey Boxing. Train your monkey to be the best boxer in the game. It is really a comprehensive game for a little android app. Good graphics, training modes, level up, block, punch, etc. So far, I've found it to be a little easy, but I am at the lower levels still. I'd recommend.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game is fun and even my kids like it.I have to say though wish it did have timer.Because it would be spittle more fun.
B007WEQ3K8|4.0|I am in my early 40s and find that sometimes my memory isn't what it used to be. Kind of like a hard drive that sometimes skips a sector. I have been using this program for a couple of weeks and find that it has been helpful in forcing me into short term memory lessons. The negative is that it doesn't ramp up to more difficult levels; it only starts and maintains there. I find the 30 seconds that it gives to memorize 3 four digit numbers and associate them with certain names is highly difficult. Level one should be 2 digit numbers. Level two should be 3 digit numbers. Level three should be 4 digit numbers and so on.<br /><br />This game is not mindless fun (think Angry Birds).  If you want some challenging games that will keep you on your toes, this is a good game for you. I would definitely purchase again.
B005HSL626|4.0|Shoot this game is so much fun when ur bord or just like playing game .. So get this it not and keep calm and play on haha
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Since we no longer subscribe to HBO, we had some catching up to do - and getting this set was the ticket!
B00992CF6W|5.0|can u make a demo minecraft pocket edition it wood me fun to play in online or u can make the game free plz.
B00FI7XBIS|3.0|I haven't played it a lot yet, but it's a decent game.  I'm an angry birds fanatic, so I appreciate the physics-based games, but it takes some getting used to and I'm not a fan of having to spend money in the game if I want more bombs and such.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|This a great game that keeps getting better as you get further along in it.  These folks put some time into developing this one.  I get addicted into the game play and find myself  wearing out fingers reaching new levels and players.  This is one game that all my grandchildren enjoy playing.
B00EY7MFKS|4.0|If you liked the Avengers or the TV show Heroes, you'll LOVE this!  It's got good acting, a great cast, action, comedy, suspense... The only thing people seem to complain about is the LONG name.  Which, really, is kinda silly...<br />As long as it doesn't crash & burn like Heroes did after a few seasons, I'll watch this till it ends!
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Much like another analyzer I reviewed, this one was equally as good.  This app allows you to see all the channels your computer can see around you, their names, security, the channel/frequency they are on, and signal strength.  With that information, I was able to pick an un-congested area of the freq spectrum, which reduced interference and improved the quality of my WiFi.
B00EOO55GW|3.0|It's good, but not Great... There are 3 REALLY good songs, but the rest just kind of seems like filler...
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This is a good game but look out. Get ready to pull your hair out. There are few freebies and no daily bonuses. On higher levels it is more about luck than skill. Get ready to beg for lives in hopes of finally getting that one lucky match to pass the level.
B00G32QIEG|5.0|Jeff Bridges and Ryan Reynolds... What an odd match, but they did so good together!  They seemed to feed off each others quirkyness, and it made the movie Hilarious!  The special effects and action were also amazing.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|Love it! The story is very very interesting.  The actors do a fantastic job.  Costumes are out this world. Love it!
B009C7ZQM4|1.0|It sucks and is a waste of time. Plug your Kindle into your p c to really clean it and get rid old junk files.
B00C4QLUFM|5.0|A classic! Glad to be able to watch it on my iPad!<br />Quality of sound and picture was very good.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Really great calculator and very easy to use. It is free so give it a try. You have nothing to lose.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Children shipped like disposable junk to the midwest and how some survived. A current day orphan meets one to  share a story with heart.
B006GECE9Y|1.0|So far I've spent too much time trying to do what the internet says I ought to be able to do to install Flash Player on my Kindle Fire HD. The first thing I'm told is to install this Dolphin Browser. I can't figure out how to do that even after buying it though Amazon gives instructions . The instructions are not clear to me. I am not particularly tablet inept but this has me baffled. Why \\"Amazon\\", does Kindle Fire HD not have Flash Player installed???? Why? Why?
B007MB5OCE|5.0|You will smile and laugh alot for this crazy story.  Old man has an adventure and meets many other improbable characters in his life and on the last bid for freedom.
006202406X|3.0|I've been waiting years to read Allegiant. I've been excited for it, and then dreading it. It finally arrived today, and I started and finished it right away. I'm unsure how to feel. I will try my best to describe it, though. But it will be hard, because I have a lot of feelings and not too many of them are positive. Sorry.<br /><br />I know that I will not be able to write my review without talking about the parts that bothered me the most. So there will be spoilers. But not at first. First, non spoilers. And then I will give a warning and talk mostly about some of the spoilery things :)<br /><br />I don't know how to start. The writing in Allegiant is still very amazing, liked it better than the first two books. The characters are pretty amazing, though I probably only loved Tobias in this book. Tris just could not stop pissing me off. I wish it wasn't that way, but it was and I'm not going to lie about it. I'm giving Allegiant a three star, but right now even that feels like too much when I think of the things that happened.<br /><br />I'm not going to talk too much about the book before I start talking about all the spoilers. Because there isn't much I want to say that doesn't spoil everything. But I am going to say that I did enjoy the book at times, it did some time have things that I enjoyed. I am happy that I read it, because the ending was actually the one thing that I approved of in this book. In a way, which I will explain soon. Some things were interesting to read about. I wasn't bored. But I wasn't very interested in it either. Which sucked.<br /><br />I have seen that people are attacking Veronica as a person after reading Allegiant. I will not do that. Because I adore her and I do think she's pretty amazing. Especially since I got to meet her last summer :) But anyway. I think she did a good job with this book, though I mostly just liked the ending. But I am still very interested in seeing what she writes next, and I'm not going to hate her for not writing this book like I wanted her to do. I do, of course, feel a little bit resentment. But not too much. I hope.<br /><br />Now begins the SPOILERS. Do not read unless you want to know or have finished Allegiant :)<br /><br />I adored Tobias in this book. He just gets better for each book. But seriously. Is anyone ever going to care for him? To love him, and to think of him first? It's starting to bother me a lot that no one does. It isn't fair and to me it felt very overlooked. Tobias deserved more. He deserved more love and more faith. Which he did not get. And that breaks my heart the most. But even so, I adored reading about him and he will always be one of my favorite characters from every book. He is just perfect. So broken.<br /><br />Then there is Tris. My god, I could not stand her in this book. And I'm sorry for saying it, but not really. I did not like her in this book. I did not approve of her choices. She does not talk enough with Tobias. She does not seem to trust him. She does not comfort him at all. And she has done so many mistakes. When he does one, I didn't even think it was that big of a deal, she's breaking up with him. Talk about unfair. I felt like she was being childish. After how much she hurt him, and he survived that. So she should too.<br /><br />There is just so many things in this book that I disliked. We get to know why there are factions, why they live alone. And to be honest, I wasn't impressed with it. It was interesting, but not exciting for me. Things just felt a bit flat for me. The characters weren't very interesting anymore either, and that made me very sad. I did like Christina, though not too much of her either. More of Cara, and I'm even starting to like her more than Tris. She would even be better for Tobias. Sigh. I just did not love this book.<br /><br />One of the worst things about this for me was that Marcus was not punished for all the wrong things he did. I wanted him to die a horrible death. He didn't even get shotor tortured or anything. It wasn't fair and yeah. Not happy about it. I even started liking Peter, and I'm not pleased about his ending either. Didn't truly think he was that much of a coward. I liked Uriah better in this book, but then he had to die. Which truly sucked, because he was one of the better characters. All the good ones die, I suppose.<br /><br />But then. The thing I hated the most happened at about page 300. Tobias does something kind of stupid, like I said above, and Tris is so heartbroken and angry about it and blah blah blah. It was nothing compared to her killing Will. To her giving up her life at several occasions. Yet she acts like Tobias did an unforgiving thing. He did not deserve that kind of treatment at all and it broke my heart. Made me hate Tris a bit. She wasn't being fair. It gets sorted, but not in the way I felt it needed to be.<br /><br />I just couldn't get over the way she treated him. And I'm sorry, but oh. I'm pissed off about it. Which is why I did not mind the ending too much; because Tobias deserved much better than her. Fine, she sacrificed her life for Caleb. But seriously? Why did she do that? Caleb wanted to do it. He didn't have the best boyfriend and the best friends. So why did she go and die, when she said she did not want to leave Tobias? Who does that? I may be able to understand it, but not now. To me it was selfish.<br /><br />But in a way I'm happy she died. It made my heart break for Tobias, because he deserves more than anybody to be happy. It's even making me cry right now, because my heart breaks for him. But I'm happy it was her that died and not Tobias. That would have just been.. unforgiveable. But I'm still not agreeing with it, because to me it was a silly reason. Which you should all get if you have read the book. But anyway. Tobias was the bright point in this book. His point of view was the very best of it all.<br /><br />Oh, and that is the biggest spoiler. Kind of. Because why else would Veronica add Tobias point of view to these books? Oh, because Tris dies and then someone else need to tell the end of the story. I should have gotten that ages ago, when it was announced. Sigh. But anyway. I am glad I read Allegiant, I just know I will not forgive the way Tobias was treated. He deserved so much more and I will stand by that. Anyway. I just had to share my spoilery thoughts. Thank you. Read it? Give me your thoughts :)or tortured or anything. It wasn't fair and yeah. Not happy about it. I even started liking Peter, and I'm not pleased about his ending either. Didn't truly think he was that much of a coward. I liked Uriah better in this book, but then he had to die. Which truly sucked, because he was one of the better characters.

B00C8S9VKM|5.0|Quite possibly the most interesting and informative book I have ever read.  It was like reading a daily paper on the date of each event.  More please, more!!
0312641893|5.0|This is my fourth time reading Cinder. And it is still one of my favorite books. I still love it just as much as I did when I first read it, over three years ago. I haven't read it in over two years, though, so I was a tiny bit nervous, that my feelings might have changed. I worried for nothing. Because reading this book again was simply perfection. And I'm so glad that I finally decided to read it again too. The writing is all kinds of beautiful. The story is the most amazing. And I couldn't have loved Cinder any more than I did.<br /><br />My love for this book cannot be explained. But I shall try anyway. Despite having talked about it three times before. But then again, my previous reviews kind of sucked, lol, so I shall try to do better this time. I adored reading this book again. It made me so happy. It was so easy to get lost in Cinder again, so easy to read it again. The writing is, as I said, beautiful. I love it the most. This is such an easy book to read. Time went by so fast. And that is just the best feeling. I'm so glad that I still love this the most.<br /><br />I don't know what to say about this precious book. So I probably won't say all that much. Just. I love it to pieces. I love how it is sort of a retelling of Cinderella, yet totally not as well, since it is so different. I love the setting of this book. Getting to know all the history was so awesome. I loved how they didn't have cars anymore. I loved how they had androids for just about everything. Simply put, I loved every single moment of this book. The story was incredible. The characters are still the very best. Sigh. &#60;3<br /><br />I cannot wait to re-read the other books too. To get to read more about the new characters about to show up. Ack. I'm oh so excited. The ending for Cinder is all kinds of mean and heartbreaking. And I loved it to most. It's awesome. I should also mention that Cinder is my favorite character. She is all kinds of brave and awesome. Her stepfamily is the worst, and that is that. But oh my, Peony. My heart is still breaking. The most heartbreaking and amazing part of the book. Sniffs. Just loved it all so much.<br /><br />I need to write a few more things about this book. Cinder is the most awesome. And Prince Kai is just the most adorable. I love him oh so much. And my heart is breaking for him. He is losing so much in this book. It's oh so mean. Hmph. I also adored Iko to pieces. She's an awesome character. Then there was Queen Levana. Well, I liked her in Fairest. Sort of. But oh, how I hate her too. She's just the worst. Yet an excellent villain. Reading about the Lunars is just all kinds of exciting and horrifying. I loved it lots.<br /><br />The romance in this book is adorable. Okay, there isn't really kissing at all, which is a bit depressing. But there is flirting. And it is the most adorable. Watching Kai flirt with Cinder is so cute. He likes her so much. And she likes him too. And aw. I just adore them both the most. I need Winter right now, though, because I need more romance with them. Sniffs. I need more. I want more. I cannot live without more. Cinder and Kai is my favorite couple in this series. I just can't help but love them the most of everyone.<br /><br />Before she knew what she was doing, she was storming after Kai. She grabbed his elbow and spun him back around to face her. Without hesitating, Cinder wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him.<br /><br />I also very much adore Marissa Meyer. She has always been amazing. She is the kindest person and such an amazing author. I like her oh so much. She's always been so kind to me, and that means the most. &#60;3 Hugs. Thank you for always being the best Marissa. I simply cannot wait to read even more books by her :D I'm a bit crazy about her books, lol, and I know I will read everything that she is writing next. But first re-reading Scarlet and Cress. &#60;3 Then finally Winter. Oh, I have waited so long for it now. Almost here.<br /><br />If you still haven't read Cinder, I'm not sure what to tell you. You make poor life choices, lol. Because this is not a book to be missed. It is a book that you must read. And then read again and again, like I have. It is a book that will make you feel all the things. It is a book that you will never ever forget. So yes. If you still haven't read Cinder, then get going. You are missing out. I'm the most excited about loving this book. And I want you all to love it too. Just, so thrilled to finally have taken the time to re-read it. &#60;3<br /><br />---<br /><br />I first read Cinder on January 5th 2012.

B00FEHXISA|5.0|I liked the second movie but didn't love it. I'm really glad they turned things around with this one. Lots of humor and action had my wife and me entertained the entire time.
B00EVRHE8E|5.0|I've known for months that when I finally got to read this book I would love it. And I did. I loved it so much. It broke my heart a bit, though. Because it's very real and I felt so much for everything that happened in this book. It almost made me cry. It made me smile like a crazy person. I just loved it so much.<br /><br />I don't think I will post any spoilers in my review. Just talking about the things I loved. Like Cath and Levi. And Cath's obsession with Simon Snow. Which was all kinds of awesome and I can relate to that so much. Fangirl was the best kind of book. Cath is a part of a fandom. Yet I'm fangirling about her :)<br /><br />I don't know how to deal with my feelings for this book. On the one hand, I loved it more than Eleanor and Park. But on the other this romance seemed to have more issues at first than Eleanor and Park did. But then again, this romance might have been ever better and sweeter and gave me all the feels. Sigh. I just loved them both. Both books are amazing. I need more.<br /><br />There is so much to love in Fangirl. And I loved all of it. The book is told from the point of view of Cath, 18 year old first-year college student. I adored her so much. She felt so much like myself in the beginning. Though not really, since I have not gone to college. I don't have the same experience as she does and get. Probably won't ever, but I'm okay with that. Because I get to read books like this. I get to fall in love with these amazing characters. I loved reading about Cath. She's cute, funny and I loved her.<br /><br />Cath is a twin. Her sister is named Wren, and I think I liked her. I can't decide. She got better near the end. Maybe. But oh. She's a bit awful in this book. She's selfish and mean and I did not approve of her. She hurt Cath a lot. I did not like that. But, I loved their father. He's a bit crazy but I loved that about him. He's awesome. Wish we had gotten to read more about him, though. Then there is their mother. I hated her. She left when they were eight. We get to read a bit about her. Glad Cath hated her too.<br /><br />There is just so much in this book. So many characters. So many things happening, though it isn't all that exciting things, since it's not a fantasy book. But oh. I loved all the little things. I loved reading about Cath in college. About her writing class. About her writing with a******-Nick. Most of all I loved that Cath wrote fan fiction. I haven't tried it yet, but years ago I loved reading it so much. I craved it. And yeah. This was amazing to read about. Because I got Cath's obsession. Like I'm obsessed with Rob.<br /><br />I loved reading about Cath's roommate, Reagan. She's awesome. Though I did understand why Cath got jealous a few times. That was a bit sad. But yeah. Reagan was amazing and I loved her. Then there is Levi. The love interest. And oh, he is perfect. Well, he does some dumb things, but I don't hate him for it. He's charming and sweet and all kinds of amazing. I loved reading about him. And him and Cath together. It was so good. And sweet. And I can't get over it. I wanted more, but I loved what there was.<br /><br />I need to know more about Simon Snow, though. And Baz. Cath write about them being in love, and it's the sweetest thing. I want to read her entire fan fiction. I want to read the eight books. Though they sound a lot like Harry Potter, they are not the same. And, goddamn it, I wanted them to be real. Now just waiting for Rainbow to write those eight books, lol :D Would love to read them. Though first I need a sequel to Fangirl. &lt;3 Oh, I've talked too much. Just, writing is perfect. The characters are amazing.<br /><br />There were a couple of things I disliked about the ending of this book. Which I will discuss. And it will be spoilery. Though nothing too bad, I think, just some of the romance. I guess you should read it if you want to know :) But anyway. The romance is awesome, but oh. I kept waiting for this one thing to happen, because it had been pretty steamy and Cath thought about sex a lot, and then it never happened. At least she never mentioned it happening. That disappointed me. Need a sequel for it ;p<br /><br />But even though I did not get that sex scene, there were still some amazing kissing scenes and no-kissing scenes. This was a romantic book and I loved Cath and Levi so much. But yeah. I am disappointed that I didn't get to know whether they slept together or not. Thought that was an important thing to get to know. Oh, well. I was happy about the ending. But yes, I do want another book :) Need it. I need to know what happened with Cath's fan fiction. What happened with the final Snow book.<br /><br />Anyway. This book is amazing. I loved it and I think all of you would love it too. So, go buy it if you haven't yet. And if you do have it then go read it. It's worth it. Even with the bit of heartbreak. I enjoyed the ending of the book. Okay, I enjoyed all of the book. And if you haven't read Eleanor & Park either, then you should do that too :D Because both books by Rainbow are amazing. I hope she continues to write these amazing YA books. I will read anything she writes. (Well, about teenagers. &lt;3)it had been pretty steamy and Cath thought about sex a lot, and then it never happened. At least she never mentioned it happening.

B002BWQ6H6|3.0|I know he is supposed to be a great writer, but this book is essentially a collection of short stories and is repetitively written.  He writes about grief and death and love from supposedly various perspectives, but they are really all his own.
B004LROUNG|3.0|This book is an enjoyable read, however it is quite predictable. There are no dramatic plot twists or any real measure of suspense I have come to expect from Grisham. Decent, but not on the same level as what I have to come to expect from one of my favorite authors.
B0091REZMW|2.0|Great game but I wear glasses and struggle to read the minute writing other wise great game buy it now
B00BPDR3F6|4.0|A fantastic read with wonderful storytelling. The voices of the characters placed you right there in that time period. Botany and relationships intertwined so interestingly, never leaving a moment dull.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Amazing show! I have never seen a better show in my life! I can't wait to see the rest of it!
1451695195|5.0|A merger of science and belief on a trip above and beyond your own mind - highly recommended for anyone pondering our existence.
B008Y6OS64|4.0|A very funny movie with several future stars in the cast. Dark subject matter, coarse language and some nudity.<br />.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Never played it before but got hooked on &quot;candy&quot; from the first minute!! Got to level 27 and it is only second day I am playing!Highly recommend.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This is the best method I have found to stay in touch with my friends and family.  From all around the world we can communicate.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Overall a great way to end a series although the ending was very emotional. But not many authors can do that. Thanks Veronica for bring divergent into our lives. Loved the series to
B007SVPZMW|2.0|The graphics are okay but it's s.l.o.w. and it's just tic-tac-toe. Very quickly it gets very boring. I played it just a few times and removed it from my tablet.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|When I downloaded this game I erased every other game I had that's how great it is  my mom had to take my kindle away just so I could do my homework besides that I LOVE IT!!!!!!  I play every class except for the gunner not to fond of him
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|First off. I accidentally put it through the wash. Twice. And once through the dryer. And it still works. Freakin Amazing!!. From comments about other trackers, the chance that you loose it or wash it seems pretty high unless you have one that goes on your wrist. The wrist ones are just too obtrusive for me. I don't like feeling it all the time around my wrist,and I wash my hands a lot so the wrist ones weren't for me. With the pulse I hardly realize I have it on.I bought this primarily for the heart monitor, since almost no other fitness trackers have it. Especially at this price.<br /><br /> I like the sleep tracker. The wristband that it uses when sleeping holds it well and is pretty comfortable. It has a rubber clip that holds the unit for when you clip it to you during the day. It holds well and doesn't slip. I work in a restaurant and do a lot of bending, moving and walking. It has never comes loose.The sleep tracking is fine, the app that goes with the Withings Pulse tracks 4 things for you. Steps taken, (against a goal you set up), Sleep time and how well you sleep. ( 8 hours is the goal it sets for you, and then it tracks deep sleep, light sleep, and how long it took you to fall asleep and how often you wake up) I can't comment on the light/deep sleep tracking because I don't know. From how I &#34;feel&#34; when I wake up it seems close. I do think the waking up part of the tracking is pretty accurate.<br /><br /> The step tracker seems pretty accurate, though I haven't compared it to other fitness trackers. This is a basic feature on every fitness tracker out there and it is what it is.<br /><br />It has a weight tracker on it. ( Best used I suppose with the Withings scale since it uses blue tooth to interact with the Pulse) If you don't have the scale then you just input your wieght manually. It tracks toward a goal weight you want to achieve and how much you want to lose each week.<br /><br />The other screen tracks how high you &#34;climb&#34;. I haven't really had need for that yet.<br /><br />Another screen tracks your &#34;miles&#34; moved. It's interesting when you see how many steps you walked and then see the miles. I haven't used it for running yet, so I think that would be the best use of the miles screen.<br /><br />The other screen tells calories burned. You can input manually through sister apps what food you consumed if you want to. Too much work for me.<br /><br />The heart monitor is fairly accurate within 5-10 beats. I have taken 3-4 measurements one after another and get results within that range. It's best used during workouts to give you a close guess to you pulse.<br /><br />Overall as good a tracker as there is out there for the price. It does what it say it will do and is obviously well made since it has been washed and dried and still works. As with any small fitness tracker just be sure you &#34;find&#34; it before you do laundry.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|John's up to his old tricks again in Sycamore Row. The book is good but the usually invisible twist was plainly visible from the middle of the book onward. Also it rambles along at a very boring pace in the middle.<br /><br />I think Grisham might have started taking Demerol....<br /><br />All in all I liked it just as I like all his books but this certainly wasn't his best.
0061122416|5.0|I don't have anything to add to what others have said about the book. If you like these kind of books and stories you will like this book. It is one that I will read again and then probably again to get the most out of it. Buy it.
B001XV3LSS|5.0|Wonderful movie... Love watching it over and over through the years. It never gets old- kids loved watching it for the first time too.
B00AL1ONN8|3.0|This album was ok at best.  I'm a fan of T.I. and there was only 3 songs that stayed in heavy rotation on this album.
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|Well worth it. Pleasant and engaging. Not too difficult but hard enough to maintain interest. The designers have done an excellent job.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great show! Was available immediately and just as good as season 1. Would highly recommend to anyone who enjoyed previous season
B0035LJY6C|5.0|I have always loved the Adams Family and this movie is funny. They have the charters down to a &#34;T&#34;.
