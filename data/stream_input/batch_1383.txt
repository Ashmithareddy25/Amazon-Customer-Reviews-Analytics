B004LZFWJO|2.0|Even for a free app it wasn't all that fun.  The controls were okay, the graphics weren't all that fab, and after a few seconds the flair of moving candy around was gone.  Even my four year old that loves candy and anything bright and colorful put it down after two mins.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is the best game ever and to who ever says 1 star or 0 stars we don't care about your opinion.
B003VTZTU8|2.0|As a scientist, I read the book with some interest in learning more, but honestly found the author's attitude very tough to take.  The writing was poor, bordering on a screed in tone.  I don't disagree with the lack of scientific integrity in those he's writing about, but I do take issue with how he expresses himself.  Ben seems to have a huge ego that he just cannot temper with any sense of scientific detachment and analysis, oftentimes by name calling the opposition and in doing so, turning off the reader and anyone who is simply searching for the truth.<br /><br />Ben is simply singing to the choir.<br /><br />It's unfortunate because the book would be more useful if it simply spoke to the facts, using them to educate the uninitiated reader in the power of the scientific method.  I should have been tipped off by the subtitle of the book.  If you think the cover is over the top and serves to promote stereotypes, take this as a sign.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|this game is fun so far hopefully the.challenge will increase with increasing levels, I.got.it free don't think.I would pay for it.though.
B002RI9HUM|4.0|This is a must read. Very light hearted and enjoyable style of reading. Relatable characters and great plot. I think this is one of Marian keys best books. I am a huge fan of her books but seemed to connect with this one the best. It did help that I was on holiday when I read it. It gave the book more meaning.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|Stylish, different, engrossing and thrilling. Those words sum up how I feel about Drive. It's not necessarily going to be everyone's cup of tea, mostly due to the slow pace of the film. This will most likely generate a certain boredom in the more impatient movie-goers who can't appreciate the artistic value of the film.<br /><br />In my opinion, the only thing wrong with the film is that some of plot elements are things we may have seen many, many times before, but the execution and style of the film saves it from being generic.<br /><br />Like I said, it won't be everyone's cup of tea, which is unfortunate, because a film this unique deserves all the recognition it gets.

1612130607|5.0|I have read the first two \\"fifty\\" books in about 36 hours (and I work full time and have 3 kids)! It is just that good!! I can't stop thinking about Ana and Christian. The sex scenes are very tastefully written but sooooo captivating! Yes.....while no one really has that much great sex in real life......why not be able to live vicariously through these characters? They make you want to do a little more hand<br />holding and ear nibbling with your significant other! I can't wait to get started on the last book but will be sad when I reach the end of the trilogy! Who says romance is dead?? They should read this to get some ideas! (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) in shouty caps!
0374275637|5.0|Daniel Kahneman, a cognitive psychologist who won the Nobel Prize in economics in 2002.  He trained in one discipline and won a Nobel Prize in another discipline.  This is someone to watch since he combines the empirical work he has conducted in psychology with the decision processes which are key to the understanding of economics.  This book is bursting with ideas and frameworks for understanding decision making that are difficult to summarize here.  I recommend this book to anyone who wants to take a deep dive into the human psyche.<br /><br />One major effect of his work has been to overturn the assumption that human beings are rational decision-makers.<br /><br />Mr. Kahneman divides the mind into two broad components. \\"System 1\\" makes rapid, intuitive decisions based on associative memory, vivid images and emotional reactions. \\"System 2\\" monitors the output of System 1 and overrides it when the result conflicts with logic, probability or some other decision-making rule.  The second system is a bit lazy.  We must make a special effort to pay attention, and such effort consumes time and energy.<br /><br />System 1 is intuitive, always on, fast, automatic; very fast and efficient at detecting abnormalities and surprises.  It continually monitors the environment doing threat and opportunity assessments.  It is called the cognitive unconscious by others.  System 1 looks to create coherent stories and often creates false causal links.  System 1 can make good decisions in situations where pattern repeat.<br /><br />Systems 2 is conscious, rational, deliberate, lazy, not always on; also, called executive function.  System 1 is not capable of doubt while System 2 is capable of it.  System 2 helps self-discipline and important decision making.  It leads to the development of new skills which can be incorporated into System 1.<br /><br />Cognitive stress encourages engagement of system 2.<br /><br />Familiarity encourages default to system 1 and lack of critical review bysystem 2 and liking something.<br /><br />With System 1, people see too much coherence of events where there is none.  Randomness is more frequent than we believe.  Predictions fail because the world is unpredictable.  Be prepared for uncertainty.<br /><br />Pay attention to how a decision is made, not just the outcome of a decision.  Big challenges for humans often come about from over relying on System 1 in a world that is too complicated for System 1 to be the main source of decision making.  Learning to engage System 2 when System 1 is likely to fail will help with important matters while System 1 can handle many of the day-to-day matters where simple pattern recognition is sufficient.<br /><br />Libertarian ideals impose costs on the individual and society when individuals make bad decisions.  Libertarian paternalism may be a better approach for human behavior (example in the book Nudge).  Humans need help to make good decisions.
1612130585|5.0|I honestly do not have time to read right now. I'm super busy and sometimes the only time I sit down is on the toilet. Not a romantic place to read this gorgeous, romantic story, but I was very motivated. Following Grey and Ana was my favorite entertainment. I need to clarify whet I expect from a book. I expect to be transported to another world. I want to care what happens to the characters. I want to see good things happen and I want to fret if there are bad things happening.<br /><br />This book gave me all those things. In Fifty Shades Darker, I got to fall in love again. How amazing is that? A good book will delivery you right back to your own life's favorite moments. Ms. James takes excellent care of her readers' heart as you are engaged in her plot. Now this one ends with a delicious cliff hanger. I love when I get to read a complete series. With Grey and Ana? I would be totally chomping at the bit or slathering on my lollipop, or whatever the appropriate saying might be.<br /><br />Read this story if you want a good time. It will give you everything you need as a reader though, I highly recommend this series. I'm purchasing the next book as soon as I am done. Trying to savor it because you only get to read these books once for the first time.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|a easy game to play while I'm at work on third shift.  Really makes u think and helps pass the time away
B0052U59F4|5.0|It takes courage to write like this. Flat out, balls out of your pants, no seat belt, no regret writing is a free fall. When you're done with this novel you will know Ms. James. You'll know she's smart, well-read, and funny. That's all well and good. What we might not see is that to slap your name on a book this different? You have really put your heart out there.<br /><br />It's quite a thing. A heart, free from it's protective covering that normally keeps it safe. That's what this story feels like for me. I want to protect it. Maybe because it is such a chance? A risk? After seeing so many positive reviews, I can totally fist pump. The very few negative ones filter in though and it makes me want to pull this story in and cover it saying, \\"Shh..They don't understand you like I do.\\"<br /><br />I think I'm lucky to see it for what it is, a beautiful love story. Because the heart behind these fictional characters is equally compelling.<br /><br />I'm proud of you Ms. James. Great story, expertly told. On to the next for me.

B002W1HBN4|5.0|Arista Records celebrates the 25th anniversary release of Whitney Houston's debut album with a satisfying dose of nostalgia. The deluxe edition features improved CD sound quality, five bonus tracks, and an expanded booklet.<br /><br />A 41-minute DVD accompanies the CD, including rare TV performance clips, special interviews from Houston and Arista record executive Clive Davis, and promotional music videos from the album. In his interview, Davis, who discovered Houston at an Upper West Side nightclub in New York, reveals the excitement he felt hearing Houston's voice for the first time, describing it as \\"a natural vocal gift.\\"<br /><br />That natural vocal gift lay the foundation for Whitney Houston's eponymously-titled first studio album, a blend of ballads, duets, and mid-tempo dance songs. The balladry yields the best moments on the album--the carefully-chosen material allowing Houston's powerful voice to soar effortlessly over incredible vocal heights in \\"You Give Good Love,\\" \\"Saving All My Love for You,\\" and \\"Greatest Love of All.\\" It remains a feat that few contemporary singers in pop music have been able to match.<br /><br />The album closes with the tender \\"Hold Me,\\" Houston's duet with the late Teddy Pendergrass, a song that first appeared on Pendergrass' 1984 album Love Language (a full year prior to Houston's debut release).<br /><br />(Collector's note: One minor oversight in the reissue was to include the more popular single remix of \\"How Will I Know\\" instead of the original mix of the song, which first appeared on early editions of the 1985 album. This now-elusive mix started differently and used an alternate vocal during the bridge solo.)<br /><br />Greatest Hits of All: Saving All My Love for You, You Give Good Love, How Will I Know, Greatest Love of All

0525478817|5.0|The only problem I have with this book is that it is marketed as a 'YA' book, which I think does it a great disservice.  I am a 57 year old, Ph.D. educated male - I say this NOT to impress, but to simply indicate I am NOT anywhere near the demographic this book is being marketed to - and yet I would say it is perhaps in the top ten of my favorite books of all time.  When I think YA, I inevitably think of 'Twilight' and other non-literature of that ilk (I am sorry if that offends anyone - I honestly tried to read 'Twilight' but could only stomach 3 pages).  This is YA in the sense that 'To Kill a Mockingbird' is YA - and yes, it IS that good. After reading this, I insisted my 89 year old mother read it and she loved it as well. I am not ahamed to say that I cried for several minutes after reading the final page - and if you can make it through without doing the same, I pity you.  Some people claim this book is depressing, but I found it uplifting and not at all downbeat - in fact I also laughed out loud many times reading it.  This is my first John Green book, but I am eagerly looking forward to reading his entire back catalog. So no matter your age or other defining characteristics, just do yourself a favor and pick up this book immediately - you won't be sorry.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|[This review is for the theatrical release.]<br /><br />I have read 12 of the John Carter novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs.  \\"A Princess of Mars\\" was the first and had Carter die in a mystic cave and spiritually elevate himself to the red planet Mars, aka Barsoom.  The old Marvel comics series and the newer John Carter series from Dynamite [[[ASIN:1606902458 Warlord of Mars: Dejah Thoris Volume 1 - The Colossus of Mars TP]]] were my only other resource and I'm really happy to report that the film follows along pretty much along the lines of the campy, pulp style of the early 20th century.<br /><br />2012 is the 100th anniversary of the publication of A Princess of Mars and so I was hoping this film would capture the spirit and it did!  Pro reviewers online were wondering about the film's derivation or why the Tharks had tusks, blah blah.  Clearly they had not read the book!<br /><br />Burroughs is actually related to John Carter and finds Carter has died and ERB has inherited the estate and is left with a diary that is full of the adventures of Carter's time on Mars.  This is a common device with Burroughs's stories.  I recall his Pellucidar tales had a type of radio that the author would get his stories from.  Or on Barsoom, some kind of radio or telepathy was used.<br /><br />In the film, the first meeting of the Tharks and Tars Tarkas was really realistic from the book's perspective.  The personality of Tars is just what I would have imagined:  a Jeddack (king) of his people, proud, challenged and sees an opportunity to help his planet.<br /><br />The princess is also of the same mind:  she sees in Carter not only the salvation of her civilization, but also the salvation of his heart.  Carter's family was brutally murdered during his time in the Civil War and in burying him he lost all hope and all purpose in life.  Can Deja Thoris rekindle that purpose?<br /><br />The bad guys in the piece are Tharns.  I can't remember them from the novel but I have seen this type of tale before - immortal beings who hold sway over lesser beings and guide a planetary civilization to death and despair, and them move onto another one and do the same thing.  Their agents on Earth are prepping us while they mop up Mars (Barsoom).<br /><br />And I loved the special effects.  Helium I imagined more a city in the sky, but they had it down pretty well.  The flyers were as I imagined - giant Dragonfly designs and the fights in the sky were great to see.  The crowd scenes were fun, as well as the gladiator battles with the Great White Apes!<br /><br />Bottom Line:  Don't listen to the naysayers and closed-minded critics.  If you like camp, and long for those thrilling days of yesteryear, check out this film.  No, it's not the best film they could have made of our gentleman of Virginia, but the sum of its parts - Western, Science Fiction and Fantasy Adventure - were really well done.  Recommended.<br /><br />And don't forget the great music.  Got to catch the soundtrack.<br /><br />Get the original books and the movie novelization too:<br /><br />[[ASIN:1907960023 John Carter of Mars: The Collection - A Princess of Mars; The Gods of Mars; The Warlord of Mars; Thuvia, Maid of Mars; The Chessmen of Mars]]<br />[[ASIN:1423165586 John Carter: The Movie Novelization: Also includes: A Princess of Mars (John Carter of Mars)]]<br /><br />Other Books Mentioned in this Review:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B003VPX0JE The Pellucidar Series]]<br />[[ASIN:B004NSV4D2 Tarzan: The Complete Adventures of Edgar Rice Burroughs]]<br />[[ASIN:B006X7OH0I VENUS SERIES COMPLETE COLLECTION (PIRATES OF VENUS-LOST ON VENUS-CARSON OF VENUS-ESCAPE ON VENUS-THE WIZARD OF VENUS)) BY EDGAR RICE BURROUGHS -THE AUTHOR OF JOHN CARTER OF MARS and TARZAN]]<br /><br />And don't forget the comic books:<br /><br />[[ASIN:0785159908 John Carter, Warlord of Mars Omnibus]]<br />[[ASIN:B005FOF8QW John Carter of Mars: Weird Worlds]]of tale before - immortal beings who hold sway over lesser beings and guide a planetary civilization to death and despair, and them move onto another one and do the same thing.

B005VTS4EY|4.0|If you like puzzles and turing to solve things then you might like this game. The object of this game is to try to get all the red square, circle, or rectangles away from the green ones, but while trying to get the red ones away you have to figure out how to keep the green ones from not flying away with the red. It is a lot tricked then it sounds but I think I is a very good game to get your brain thinking :)

B004BJMEO6|5.0|Girl meets girl and falls in love but shock horror one girl already has a bloke arghhhh.  A paster and very commited relationship/marriage of 15 years.<br />The lesbian in the story, knows who she is and is very clear about this but looses her heart.  The 'straight' girl needs time to explain the relationship to her son and end things with her husband.  This of course takes time and the lesbian gal doesnt know is she being taken for a test or experiment or what.  She wants commitment in a realistic fashion.  The straight gal breaks all off with her husband and the lesbian gal BUT time passes and the ending is meaningful and beautiful and so right when true love is felt.  A lovely story confronts some real life dilemma with a fairy tale finish I loved.  Highly recommend.

0385738773|1.0|An unbelievably huge disappointment after the brilliant first book in this series.  What was never clear was how, in this dystopian future where a virus is turning most of the population into zombie crazies, society has the money, resources and talent to build the elaborate and extremely expensive Maze of the first book, and the technology to read minds and erase memories.  So at the end, what exactly was the point?  It turns out that the Maze and the Trials of the first and second books were supposed to pick a teen with the greatest survival skills.  For what purpose?  To take out his brain.  For what purpose?  \\"To study it.\\"  That's actually the sum total of the point. The teens get their memories back, with absolutely no consequence one way or the other.  We learn that the virus killing everybody was deliberately released, by the U.S. government of course, as a \\"means of population control.\\"  Why exactly would the government release a deadly virus that could kill everyone in its path? Of course we don't get a clue.  Badly written, badly plotted, superficial characters, an author who clearly was just going through the motions.

1612130283|1.0|I took the advice of several one-star reviewers and read the first three chapters of this book online, via Amazon. Oh dear Lord.<br /><br />I skimmed about half of it, noting that other reviewers were very correct about the repetitive language. Ana blushes. She blushes again. She turns crimson and says Jeez and Oh Crap and Damn and blushes again. (Repeat every page or paragraph or every sentence or so.) She gasps, he gasps. She blushes and talks to herself a lot, in italics. He has grey eyes, long fingers; she's apparently the most naive person in America. OK, that's three chapters.<br /><br />As others have noted, there are a lot of British terms for an American girl to be speaking--one that hasn't been mentioned here is when she gets mad at her roommate and thinks, \\"I don't usually throw toys from my pram.\\" The hey? No one calls a carriage a pram here, and that saying is not in my memory. Also, there's a use of very old-fashioned terms, such as \\"uncle's monkey\\" and \\"paying peanuts\\" for rent.<br /><br />And yes, you don't drive through Portland to get to Seattle from Vancouver.<br /><br />Well. So I didn't read the rest of the novel. I don't want to, given the very poor execution and lack of editorial control in the three chapters I read. Sorry, you BSDM fans.

0307956350|4.0|After struggling with two demanding jobs, two toddlers, and a house that's falling apart, Dexter, Kate's husband, lands a lucrative job in Luxemburg. Kate has dreamed of being a stay-at-home mom. Her job as a field agent for the CIA and even her current desk job seem too fraught with danger for her young family. Feeling that she's making a good decision, she quits her job and the family moves to Europe. Then the problems start. Dexter's job has some mysterious aspects. One of the other expat moms forces a friendship that Kate isn't sure she trusts. Deceptions multiply, Kate's instincts as a spy lead her to investigate her friends and eventually her husband.<br /><br />The novel is filled with puzzles and intrigue. If you like thrillers you'll enjoy trying to figure out this one. I particularly liked the setting. Pavone made the expat experience with the attendant travel to European cites come to life.<br /><br />I did, however, have some problems with the book. The story is told predominantly through Kate's thoughts. As she becomes increasingly distrustful of her environment and questions her decision of quitting her job, her thoughts turn into many paragraphs of angst. I found it boring and didn't think the character rang true. This was particularly the case when there were so many hints that something wasn't right. I would have expected an ex-CIA agent to have been more alert and suspicious.<br /><br />Many of the details were off, as though Pavone was trying too hard to create suspense and misdirect the reader. However, it is an interesting read, particularly if you love spy novels, but be prepared to wade through a lot of internal dialog.

1250006341|5.0|The Downton Abbey Masterpiece Classic series is one of the very best in my collection of DVDs.  As far as movies go, this deserves at least five stars and it's rich in what captivates an audience.  I cherish everything about these episodes.  The cast in Downton Abbey are superb and nothing less.  It's delightful in how J. Fellows presents this family living in a luxerious palace, along with the servants sometimes undermining the family.  You observe the family trying to maintain a certain way of life and all that goes with it.  The historical events, along with the interfering members of the staff, are enough to ruin the balance of this household and family.  The suspense will keep you guessing and wanting more - always.  This is a collection you can sit down with family members and not be embarrassed by anything said or done.  This is so good that you can't wait to see the next season!

B000QJM8Z0|5.0|I saw the movie first, and loved it, so I decided that I should give the book a try. The book was great! Way better than the movie (but most of the time that's true anyway). It's a great, funny, love story. I would recommend this book to anyone who like a good romantic comedy.

B005HSG3TC|5.0|The Cover keeps the Kindle safe and secure.  I gave this to my husband, he has never taken it off off his kindle.<br /><br />The support to hold up the kindle works perfectly.  He uses it many times to watch movies hands free.  This includes laying in bed and watching.  He was propping a pillow behind it ~ to hold it up.  It pleases me to see that it has contributed to his happiness in enjoying the use of his kindle.  He did drop it one time, all is well!

B005FITIDC|5.0|Machine Gun Preacher is intense and it will haunt you. Gerard Butler is nothing short of phenomenal. For the first time since I became aware of him, I stopped seeing Gerard Butler, despite the fact that I know what Sam Childers looks like. He just became the character.<br /><br />The movie depicts violence with unflinching candor. It weighs the good religion can do against the bad that men can do and leaves the final judgment to viewers (and gives them credit for their intelligence and ability to do so.) And because I've been following all of this so closely, by the time the pics of the real Sam, (along with Lynn, Paige, Deng and the kids) came up with the credits, it felt like I was seeing a friend. I love the way the camera pulls up and away for the parting shot, leaving Sam standing amid the children on the desolate African plain until he ultimately becomes a speck on the landscape. It reminds us to keep the big picture in mind.<br /><br />The first time I saw it, despite the fact that I was looking forward to it so much that I had purchased my ticket a full month ahead of time, my head was swirling with all of the negativity that I'd been reading in the week or so before it was released in Boston. Whenever there was a scene I'd read something about, all I could do was compare what I'd read to what I was seeing. It distracted me from fully experiencing the movie, not to mention left me wondering where the derision was coming from.<br /><br />The second time I was able to just let it wash over me so that I could absorb it. I think it affected me even more that time, despite the fact that I knew what was coming. It's not something one (or at least I ) can shake off easily.<br /><br />Without taking every dismissive remark I've read one by one or line by line, let me just tell you what I thought. I love the look of the film. It's got this grainy 70s quality to it that at times, coupled with the hand-held camera work, makes it seem almost like a documentary (more on that later) or a home movie. (There is one shot that I am completely enamored of, that comes about 2/3 in. It's a scene in Sam's church, after he's gone around the bend and there is a combined camera/sound effect that reflects the tension and the chaos inside of the man.)<br /><br />The film opens with a scene of incomprehensible brutality and then quickly cuts to the seemingly more mundane life of a reprobate getting out of prison. Even as we bear witness to the brutal thug that is Sam Childers as he interacts with his family and wastes his life in a drug-fueled haze, the specter of that other scene hangs over everything and we wonder where and how the two will intersect.<br /><br />Sam's life very quickly (in movie time) spirals downward to rock bottom.The majority of reviews I've read can't, or won't, even keep the timeline straight. Sam did not find religion and start his church. He found religion, a number of years passed and he went to Africa on a service mission and when he came back from his first trip he made plans to build a church and build his orphanage.<br /><br />It needed to happen quickly. Did we really need to watch Sam shoot up in the bathroom of a biker bar more than once to understand who and what he is? By the time the catalytic encounter with the drifter occurs, we understand how bad he is. It is a testament to Sam Childers that he has the strength to reach out to his wife at that point and a testament to Gerard Butler's abilities as an actor that we feel his pain.<br />We also feel his confusion and trepidation as he sits in church, debating whether or not he's worthy of baptism and accepting Jesus into his life as his savior. The phrase \\"nervous as a whore in church\\" came immediately to mind.<br /><br />Time passes and it becomes evident that Sam has turned his life around and has devoted himself to making a better one for his family. Whether or not this is because of God is almost irrelevant. It is certainly because he's kicked his drug habit and changed his ways. Anything that helped him with that is a good thing, no matter what you believe. Sam believes it was God. He also believes that God wants him to help others and he starts with his best friend Donnie. (Much has been made over the fact that \\"Donnie\\" is not an actual person. Let's not forget that it is a movie. Some things are embellished for dramatic effect, time is compressed, real people become composites.I think there's a lot of Sam and Lynn's unseen son in Donnie- a brilliant Michael Shannon-, who suffered a similar fate.) If you're watching a movie about the 100 Years War, it's not made in real time. Sam Childers is painted in broad strokes because otherwise it would have been a six hour movie.The quest to build the orphanage threatens to consume him. He neglects his own family, including daughter Paige (Madeline Carroll. It is to her credit that she manages to deliver the film's most predictable and ridiculous line with enough real emotion and depth of feeling that we buy it), and remains as difficult and self-destructive as he ever was. I don't think it was ever his intention for the African part of his life to overshadow his life at home. When he returned from that first missionary trip, he had enough energy and zeal for both.<br /><br />With the orphanage, and his desire to save \\"those kids\\", Sam now has a new focus, or a new addiction. He believes he's found his purpose and he pursues it with blinders on. He's \\"made it {his} struggle...{He's} the one that's gonna do it.\\" As Butler has said when describing the character he plays, \\"It's about a man who fought his demons, but never banished them entirely.\\" It's easy to see why Sam latched on to those kids the way he did, aside from the fact that he has an addictive personality (much like the actor who plays him. And make no mistake, anyone who becomes an addict has an addictive personality, whether it's cigarettes, alcohol, drugs or sex. Addiction isn't about the thing that the addict is addicted to; it's about the high that the addict achieves from the addiction that hides or suppresses deeper issues. It fills a void.)<br /><br />In truth, I think that there is probably another movie that was left on the cutting room floor and a lot of the problems that a lot of people had with the film could be fixed with better editing. There were some aspects that I would have liked to have seen more fleshed out, such as Lynn's struggle back home. We're asked to take her acceptance of Sam and his mission on as much faith as she apparently was. The scene with the phone call where Lynn is in the pristine grocery store at home while Sam wanders amid the chaos of a Sudanese town, after the LRA has burned down his newly built orphanage, says a lot about their relationship. Presumably Lynn hasn't been to Africa yet, she has no real idea of the conditions there or what Sam is actually going through, but she knows he needs it, needs to be there and needs to rebuild as much as the children do. That makes her fears and her despair for what it eventually does to him all the more poignant.<br /><br />It's tempting to say that some of the scenes in Africa could have been tightened up or ask if we needed that many to understand the struggle. Ultimately I have to say, yes we did. Every one of them propels Sam along his road.<br /><br />But I also feel that the majority of the people that didn't like the movie are all sounding like broken records. They are like a rock skipping over the surface of a lake (to REALLY mix my metaphors) refusing to go deeper and refusing to see what's really there. They all read like they made up their minds before they saw the thing. Even the responses to the review on the NY Times website called out the critic for trying to pigeon-hole the film (as well as trying to be clever) by reviewing it based on their expectations as opposed to what's on the screen*.<br /><br />One of the movie's greatest strengths in my eyes is what is being called a weakness by many others and that's that it does not take you by the hand and lead you to conclusions. It lets you make up your own mind.<br /><br />Any critic's opinion is still only their opinion and everyone is entitled to their own. The problem is that there are a lot of people who read these opinions and then their minds are already shaped before they've seen the film.<br /><br />I don't think that I'm giving anything away when I tell you that there are a couple of lines in the film that, to me, sum up Sam's arc, at least in terms of the movie. Deng asks him what he's \\"looking for in this place\\". At the time, Sam either doesn't know or isn't able to articulate what we as an audience can guess, but Sam answers \\"I ain't lookin' for nothin'.\\" Later, after he's opened himself up to his purpose, he tells William, probably because he thinks William doesn't speak English, \\"I'm scared that one day I'll close my eyes to all a' this and let it be someone else's problem\\".<br /><br />William, by the way, played by Junior Magale, is just the most beautiful little boy with the most expressive eyes. His awe of \\"the white preacher\\" is writ large on his face, which makes his discovery that he can be of help to this man, that he is needed, so powerful. After four viewings, I still sob at their ultimate scene together.<br /><br />Gerard Butler plays Sam as complicated as well as courageous. He's forceful and maybe even a little crazy. Butler is in virtually every scene and there is always something interesting going on. We have only to watch his face or look into his eyes to know where he is at any given moment. He takes Sam from humility to protectiveness to raging, out of control hostility and borderline psychosis and back again. This is Butler's movie all the way. If you don't buy his performance, you don't buy the movie.<br /><br />I have to say, I love the score for the film as well. I was already a fan of Asche & Spencer and their soundtracks for two other Forster films, Monster's Ball and Stay. The music for Machine Gun Preacher is, for the most part spare and lean, acting as a thread that weaves in and out of the narrative without being intrusive (just as a good score should do), but it's also got some memorable themes and when it swells during the final shot, it moves me to the point that I have to remember to breathe.<br /><br />There is a documentary in the final stages of post production on the life of Sam Childers. While many have suggested that that format would have better suited the life story of so complex a character, the irony is that without this film and the publicity generated by it, the documentary probably would not have the chance to be seen by anything resembling a wide audience.addicted to; it's about the high that the addict achieves from the addiction that hides or suppresses deeper issues.

B007H7XJD4|1.0|Two reviews from friends and I actually decided to rent this awful movie from Amazon.  300 is a million times better than this.  Even the sad remake of Clash of the Titams was much better.  I feel like I wasted two hours and four dollars for nothing.  My time would have been better spent watching tv reruns on Amazon Prime than waiting for something redeeming to happen in this movie.  If you want to see this, wait for it hit Amazon Prime or better yet, regular tv.  You won't miss anything by waiting.
B002BWQ6H6|4.0|I probably would never have selected this book on my own, but it was chosen by my Book Club. I was one of the very few in my Club that liked it. I found it to be entertaining and believable. I actually remember reading about the tightrope incident in New York back in the '70's, so I think that made the book a little more interesting for me.
B006ZCWU5K|2.0|If you're thinking of purchasing the Special Edition, think again.<br /><br />Not only is the Special Edition in the now standard cheaply produced cardboard eco-package, but it's an odd-size, standing probably 2 inches taller than a regular jewel case. In other words, this will be one of those CDs that you can't put in a rack, that will sit in a bin with the other oddly shaped \\"special\\" discs.<br /><br />Vote with your pocket books people. The packaging is bad enough to avoid the purchase altogether.
B00715SUI6|2.0|I had heard of this movie from a friend at work. Sorta reminded me of Close Encounter of the Fourth Kind there at the end. I knew I shouldn't watch these kinds of movies, they give me nightmares. lol  I'll give it one thumb up as it did scare me and make the hair stand on end on my arms and back of my neck at times.
0307739961|4.0|Quoting Mikael Blomkvist I must say that this book is really not about spies and secret government agencies, it's about violence against women,  and the men who enable it.  The story takes an interesting turn and everybody picks sides. Mikael Blomkvist is in Lisbeth Salander's corner, and Millennium is backing him up. He's doing his best to bring the truth to the light so that Salander can get a good defense on her trial.<br /><br />On the other hand some good cops start digging dirt to uncover the crimes committed by what Mikael calls the Zalachenko Club within the SIS. This book is full of suspense and surprises like the previous two, but I don't want to give the story away. If you liked the other two, you'll be quite satisfied with this final book. It's also a page turner full of intrigue.

1451648537|5.0|Book review by Richard L. Weaver II, Ph.D.<br /><br />This is a fascinating, if not riveting, story that is not only well-written and well-constructed (organized in a chronological manner), but it is incredibly well-researched, too.  It not only revealed how open Jobs was with Isaacson, but how open all of those who were part of, influenced, or were on the fringes of Job's life, were when Isaacson interviewed them.<br /><br />From reading this book, you get this intricate portrait of a mercurial, sometimes vicious, self-absorbed, genius who had serious difficulties dealing with the realities of day-to-day living.  But, it is Jobs' peculiarities--his uniquenesses--that make this book so engaging.  You simply have a hard time believing such a person like Jobs even existed!  (Remember, Jobs did not read this book before he died.)<br /><br />One aspect of Jobs' personality--reinforced throughout the book--was that \\"ordinary rules didn't apply to him\\" (p. 313).  I found it astonishing, for example, that he couldn't be relied on to tell the truth.  It was said about him by Helmut Sonnerfeldt, \\"He lies not because it's in his interest, he lies because it's in his nature\\" (p. 313).  He was adept at misleading, being secretive, as well as being brutally honest.  He could be incredibly brutal!<br /><br />Whatever you thought about Steve Jobs--based on his public persona--this book will shake (destroy?) that image.  Isaacson pulls no punches, nor do the individuals interviewed.  Jobs was a temperrmental, insensitive, authoritative, control freak, with an emphasis on freak!  Sure, he was incredibly bright, imaginative, creative, intelligent, educated, and knowledgeable, but the way he treated others, the way he thought about others who were not his intellectual equals (or intellectual superiors!), was near pathological and perverse.  He was an egomaniac's egomaniac (terribly selfish and demanding).  To give you a mere glimpse of how selfish he was, he seldom remembered anniversaries or birthdays (p. 530).<br /><br />Jobs was not one to emulate when it comes to effective human relations, however, even though many of his personal eccentricities were not exemplary, this is a motivational book.<br /><br />There are a number of great motivational messages throughout the book.  Some of the messages include: never give up, create a vision or dream, pursue your dream, whatever it takes, surround yourself with great minds and supportive personnel (not just \\"yes people\\"), don't worry about going against the grain, be creative, take risks, defy failure, bet your career on doing things in a different way, be hands-on, know your product, be thorough, check-and-re-check, perfectionism is good and it works, have passion, infuse everything you do with emotion, focus, prepare thoroughly, do nothing half-assed, and always keep your customers in mind (be user friendly).  Jobs knew that \\"deciding what not to do is as important as deciding what to do\\" (p. 336).<br /><br />On the basic values Jobs supported--and a value seen in every Apple product which he oversaw (and a value that made Apple successful!)--is the effective marriage between technology and the humanities (p. 527).  The marriage was consummated in the silicon architecture, in the Aple organization, as well as in Jobs' own soul (p. 527)!<br /><br />If you really want an overview of who Steve Jobs was and how he operated, Isaacson does a beautiful job of summarizing in Chapter 42, \\"Legacy\\" (pp. 560-571).  It is an honest, complete, and intimate conclusion that accurately and completely draws together many of the comments, reactions, and insights scattered throughout the book.  It is a wonderful closing chapter.<br /><br />In this final chapter, too, Isaacson allowed Jobs, who had shared with him what he hoped his legacy would be throughout the course of their conversations, to be the one to conclude the book (pp. 567-570).  No, there are no completely new insights in Jobs' essay, because you absorbhis personal values, approaches, feelings, and reactions throughout the book, but Isaacson was correct, just hearing Jobs express himself at the end was a beautiful, warm, and touching way to conclude the book.  Just as Jobs was a true genius (very few measure up!), Isaacson is a genius in the manner with which he introduces him to the general public.  This is truly an incredible book.his personal values, approaches, feelings, and reactions throughout the book, but Isaacson was correct, just hearing Jobs express himself at the end was a beautiful, warm, and touching way to conclude the book.

B007AMMHSY|5.0|It is impossible to describe the \\"action\\" without spoilers so I wont. There are so many levels to this piece, and each scene allows for so much creativity and depth on the part of the director - and the acting is flawless. Banderas is our modern-day Frankenstein, in an edgy-revenge-erotic-psychotic masterpiece. The last sentence in the movie wraps it up rather well, in that we all \\"project\\" - thru our loves and hates, what we want others to be.<br />The \\"master-Frankenstein\\" becomes infactuated by his creation as well as a beautiful rendition of the \\"who's in charge?\\" as the \\"victim\\" realizes her power over the one who has her imprisoned.<br />There remains, at the end, a statement that a victim is still a victim, and who we ARE in some ways is simply WHO WE ARE - regardless of the skin we're wrapped in, or - apparently, the guilt of a perpetrator-turned-victim. The extra attention to plot development is fantastic, altho I think they edited out scenes that would have more quickly identified Norma as Bandaras' daughter. I thought the clothes she's wearing when she's first introduced in the film made her look like a servant. Maybe just me. : Bad guys dont just appear, they talk there way past emotional mothers; we find Bandaras' last wife to have been something other than what we wud think, all conveyed in a single sentence by a rapist.<br /><br />What was such a RELIEF - that even tho i believe the director Almodovor is gay - he allows his art to flourish without the American heavy-handedness of Left-wing proselytizing. For example, a father goes to visit his raped and now psychotic daughter in a mental hospital. She cannot recognize him and becomes terrified, altho the father is sensitive, thoughtful and loving. If it was a Hollywood movie, the father would be a knuckle-dragging mentally brutish idiot, who would have to be asked to leave by the intelligent-sensitive-minority-skinned-doctor; to whom the brutish father would refer to with a slur, and probably drive off with a \\"Vote Republican\\" bumper sticker on his gas-guzzler. It's been that way for 50 years, but not in this movie, even though the opportunities exist given the material.f with a \\"Vote Republican\\" bumper sticker on his gas-guzzler.

Buying the CD means I listen to it again and for that I am grateful to relive some of the feelings it brings back from that time in my life.<br /><br />While it's nostagia for me the music still applies to the themes of younger people's lives today. Well worth the listen.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I play all the time! Great free app! There are ads in between games that you have to skip but no big deal to me.
B004UC4HCG|4.0|I like this Shuttle model (SH67H3) and it goes together well. I like that it supports RAID and has good placement for the hard drives internally. The integrated CPU Cooler with heat-pipe tech to the single large fan is nice and keeps it quiet for office environments. I like the USB3 and eSATA ports are welcome for backup drives. Other external ports are laid out rationally. For a office system barebone this little box is very nice.<br /><br />What I find is the documentation is very poor, luckily that wasn't an issue for me. I see this as the big point and kills the 5th star for me.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this has some really fun games. the sushi one is my absolute favorite. urban skydiving is a hard one, as is speed chaos
B004EBUXSA|5.0|The CPU is the heart of the system. I'm really happy with the Core-i7 series as excellent value - in terms of performance per $ with a broad feature set.
B0063GORYU|4.0|fun for a free game. download if you like spider. I would give it a five star if not for the ads but it is free so can't complain too much.
B003LQMZS0|5.0|My son has been playing with this since he's about 3 months old, when he really got the hang of holding toys. I hang this over him in the playmat or the jumper and he can grab each leg easily and chews them all. He loves it.
B001PU8N0I|3.0|I got this for my mom for her christmas present. she loves all of the english shows/movies that are like this one. The only thing wrong with it is the last 20 minutes got cut out because of a scratch on the back. I notified Amazon and they shipped a new one out within a few days.
B0063IH60K|5.0|great solitaire game. this is the type of game you can not really improve upon, so it is a basic game and quite enjoyable. the ads are not annoying, as it is just a blip and you continue to play.
B000669GAI|5.0|I love this album! Hasn't left my truck in the past week. Didn't start listening to pearl jam until a few months ago and now i cant stop. It was packaged nice and still wrapped in plastic. And for less than $10, you cant beat 33 tracks of Pearl Jam!
B005KELW26|5.0|This cover is great.  Its small and compact.  Fits in my purse,<br />and with the magnet latch it stays closed.  Its also light weight.
145162445X|1.0|Larry is on a massive ego trip here and it is sickening.  Snorrrrr for his story of cosmology which I have read again and again from other authors. Get to the point Larry.  I bought this book as a favor to a relative in part because of the theological discussion which turned out to also be warmed over material.  What is new is the irritating, smug, self-righteous, self-aggrandizing delivery of this material--gag.<br /><br />Larry takes pleasure in tooting his horn and attacking christian fundamendalists--this makes elitists like him feel superior I suppose.  If he really wanted to call out religious fanaticism, why doesn't he have the courage to name the most dangerous sect on the planet today--which does not inhabit the US bible belt. (Larry likes to label the unwashed by their geographical location. Clever!)  I guess calling out those folks doesn't fit the Leftist agenda. Plus, Larry could just be a coward.  Bullies usually are.<br /><br />Speaking of Leftists like Larry, I would put them at the top of the list of threats to our planet's well-being--way ahead of any silly creationists.  Larry was on Obama's campaign science team according to his wiki page.  \\"Gawd\\" help us all.<br /><br />P. S. I do mourn the passing of Christopher Hitchens and would like to have seen his contribution to this book.  Hitchens was one from the Left that didn't seem to have the elistism that afflicts Larry, Dawkins and many others. There is some sort of symmetry, evidently, between elitism and Leftism and it shows again in Larry's book. For some reason, Hitchens, by and large, did not need to induldge in the self-aggrandizement that others of the Left seem to need to do. He was one of a kind.
B005VPRG10|5.0|Several good aspects about this set.  Would recommend purchasing it.<br />- Good price per piece for a SW LEGO set<br />- One of the best, if not the best, TIE Fighter builds for a regular (not including UCS) LEGO.  They have made several over the years.<br />- The cockpit is nice, and has a unique canopy piece.  Nice the way it opens.<br />- Sturdy construction, so it can be swooshed without falling apart.<br />- Minifigs included with the set are very nice<br />- The colors of the LEGOS used for the model are nice looking.<br />- Looks good on display
B00005JK8K|5.0|to start out, ANY person who gives this movie 1 star, would not know a good movie if it came up bit them on the arm. DO NOT pay any attention to their review, Only mine is the one you follow. If you like war movies then this is the one to watch. Lots of blood, gore, guts. Good acting as well.  LISIEN TO WHAT I'M SAYING. Watch it.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Quell is so fun. I love it! I play it everyday. The backgrounds are cool too. It is one of thebesy games I have downloaded.

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I enjoyed the entire series but I felt the third book dragged a bit and wasn't as well written as the first two.  Now looking forward to the movies!!
0062060562|3.0|Thought it was entertaing.  The way the story is written make you want to continue reading and it had a decent ending.
0545265355|5.0|I love The Hunger Games trilogy, and the hardcover is avaliable in my country for $80, so this was very worth it. The books shipped really quickly, even faster than expected. The books were also in perfect condition, no defects that I know of. Love the books. :)
0385534639|2.0|I had to force myself to read this story and it was hard to follow.  Not a lot of character development and the story seemed detache at times,to much jumping around and to many pointless characters. But I will say it was very original idea.<br />I won't recommend this book to anyone.  It didn't live up to the hype of the positive reviews.  Sorry.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I was a little skeptical about this app at first. I expected it to be another one of those collections of really boring games that I would end up deleting right away. However, I actually LOVE these games! They are genuinely fun to play and the challenge of unlocking more games makes it all the more fun! I was especially excited about Serpent because it's like the classic game Snake! This is tons of fun and it has something for everyone.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Awesome story of a young squirrell, who was orphaned at birth, as he feasts on nuts as he soars through the air in this high action adventure.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|Well engineered strategy game. All the levels work and some have very interesting solutions. I can't stop playing! Highly recommended.
B0058VW36U|5.0|it is one of the most addicting games ever. I almost cannot put it down when playing. it never freezes and always runs smoothly while playing.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|a great thinking game! love the animation of the faces &amp; the challenge of thinking around corners - especially the ones where you can't sit &amp; think about it - you just have to DO! NOW! simple fun.
B000U55YIS|5.0|If you like Baccara and their 70s music then thisnis theitem you should get. it contains all their hits in the original unaltered versions and also contains rarities that a hard to find. The spanish versions El diablo te mendo a Laredo, Baila tu or the German version eins plus eins ist eins. Also the single that ended the friendship between Maria and Maythe \\"sleepy time toy\\" The release of that single was stopped by Maria for she felt that her voice was not heard enough. Too bad, for that fight ended  the professional career of the most successful female duo. And as you know Yes sir I can boogie became one of the most selling singles in the world!  As I said, contains all their classic hits.
0143119419|5.0|Well researched and written work on the history of hedge funds and it's many stars. I wish Rennaisance Technologies were more open about what makes them tick, but we can't blame them for being secretive! Sebastian still managed to pull through some information on the most secretive of hedge funds, and provides a very thoughtful view on how hedge funds (contrary to popular opinion) were a positive participant in the financial marketplace even though they were driven only by profits. Afterall hedgies never needed any tax-payer bailouts, and they continue to adapt to the changing regulatory landscape. A must read for Finance practitioners and academics!
B0053JJLLC|2.0|Unlike other Crichton books written before he died finishing this one, this was too dark, too simple and predictable a plot, and ended with the heros all being killed along the way.  I wouldn't spend my time reading this as there are too many other superior books out there.
0060763280|3.0|This book is a motivational book not a how to book. If you know that going into it you can better appreciate it.  If you are struggling mentally with being weathly or if you are just starting on your journey this book could be very vlauable.  For me, I have read many books on the topic of weath creation and found this one more of a pep rally than a nuts and bolts type book.  This book left me disappointed hence the 3 star rating.
B004XANKVO|5.0|I am very picky when it comes to carrying my \\"stuff.\\"  I've been through about 8 backpacks/laptop bags in the past three years, and none of them were \\"the one.\\"<br />Add to that the fact that I carry a 17\\" MBP, and the field narrows considerably.<br /><br />Enter the Thule TCBP-17.<br />Form, function, durability- it's all there.<br /><br />The laptop sleeve is isolated from the rest of the storage, and helps balance the bag when it is full.  The other storage compartments are big enough to carry plenty of whatever else you need.  I recently used the backpack on a two night overnight trip as my only piece of luggage, allowing me to carry on.  I could have packed more into it had I needed.<br /><br />Pros- Design, storage capacity, looks.<br />Cons- Cost<br />Unknowns- Durability.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|Great Show.  Well written, well acted, and hilariously funny!  Every episode had me laughing until my side hurt and even better with no commercials!  Easy to watch 3 or 4 episodes in one night.
B003L77GH4|5.0|The vampire diaries in my opinion has the best writing and acting out of all the supernatural shows on tv right now.
B005F3XVA8|4.0|This movie is slow but has some highlights. It is a good family movie but could be more exciting and less boring. Seems like the same old stuff.

B006OCM0G0|5.0|this game is awesome the problem is that the food takes a long time but its worth it though best game ever
B000002LPD|5.0|I've always loved this album. I like the other Sammy era albums, but they are a little uneven; some moments of brilliance, but somewhat inconsistent. This album rocks from start to finish. It is the one Hagar album that stands up to the Roth era VH. As soon as you hear the intro to Poundcake, you know you are in for a great ride. Then comes Judgement Day; another intense rocker that will blow your socks off. Spanked is probably the weakest track on the album, but is still a respectable tune. Musically, Pleasure Dome is an incredible track; Eddie really shines here. Then you have Runaround, In n' Out, and Man on a Mission, which are just great pedal to the medal rockers. Right Now and Top of the World are the big hits from this album and are vintage Hagar, but I think they are great tracks and bring the album to a close on a positive note. There's nothing wrong with a little positive reinforcement; the world could use a little more of that. And it would be a shame not to mention Dream Another Dream; a true gem and quite possibly one of the strongest Hagar era tracks. But for all of Eddie's brilliance, I really think Alex is the star of this album. He has just never sounded better. I know there are a lot of purists out ther who think that VH is only good with Roth, but they should really give this album a chance. The musicianship is amazing and it is not dominated by keyboards, which characterizes some of the other Hagar era albums.
B003Y5H4Y8|3.0|It wasn't until discussing this movie with my wife that I discovered that Hinds was the older David and Wilkinson was the older Stephan (and not the other way around).  It could be that I'm a little slow, but I prefer to blame poor casting : ).  Otherwise, this was a good movie I would recommend.
B000JQUKKU|5.0|Christmas Carol, is a classic and worth reading again and be reminded of the beauty of conversion and new life to be lived with joy and generosity.

B005VTS4EY|4.0|I started playing the game and soon realized I had played it for an hour.  It is easy to learn and fun app to kill time.
0937381888|5.0|I am about halfway thought the book. I have learned quite a bit; I think it is important to learn the \\"why\\" before doing things - especially brewing. The author does not say much about kegging your beer, other than that he covers most things. Book is great for a first time brewer and I am sure even an experienced one would learn a thing or two.
B000A2RRF4|2.0|Okay, I'm not some major Michael Jackson fan and I've never seen him live but I was looking forward to this video. I actually bought it for my foster boy who loves music and dance and was hoping we would watch it together. Glad I previewed it first! MJ's incessant crotch-grabbing started within the first 30 seconds and did not subside. Wow. I was pretty uncomfortable watching it so I sure wasn't going to let the child see this. I'm no prude. I was a dancer for many years and have been to many topless cabarets, etc. which I enjoyed but MJ was really creeping me out. Aside from this, the audio is less than exciting. Hollow is a good description, and not a lot of clarity. Pretty poor camera work too. Perhaps my biggest criticism though was the relentless footage of crying, fainting fans. Yikes! The only good thing about that was the respite it gave from MJ's grab bag. I could not have cared less about the fans, yet the film maker insisted on cutting back and forth between them and the performance on stage. Booo! Sooo disappointing on many levels. I watched the first 30 minutes and then couldn't manage anymore. Plus, I was pretty sure my husband's head might explode if I didn't turn it off. Anyway, feeling pretty good about never having shelled out a lotta dough to see this LIVE! I just purchased a new personal CD player for my boy along with the \\"Jackson 5's Greatest Hits.\\" Maybe I'll give him the video when he graduates from junior high school.
B004GNFSO0|5.0|This was such an interesting true story!  It was about some of the atrocities of man to other men. The journey these men had was unabelievable. I just hate to finish this book.
B005IS565S|2.0|Though I don't think this record totally sucks, I am really disappointed. It's a 3 star hard rock album, but it loses a star for me because I was expected a heavier sound. I've never considered 5Finger to be a hardcore heavy metal band, but I enjoyed their first two albums a lot. This album isn't really so bad if you like hard rock, but it really kind of blows if you're expecting them to keep up the kind of pace as \\"Way of the Fist\\" and \\"War is the Answer.\\" I've listened to it a few times all the way through now, thinking maybe I'd like it more if I just gave more time. I don't like it more. The problem for me isn't the slow stuff they do, they have that on the first two albums also, but now the faster paced songs sound more like Nickelback but with some double pedal and harsher vocals. I hate Nickelback. 5 Finger has become hair metal for a new generation. They will probably get even more popular and make a lot of terrible music.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|a good time passer, a lot of content to keep you busy. would recommend it to my bros. this app is addicting and fun to play
B005URRCUY|4.0|2010 was a breakthrough year for the Black Keys. Their album \\"Brothers\\" had been well received both critically and commercially, and the band abandoned the strick 2 person formula in live settings, all to great effect. Only 18 months after \\"Brothers\\" now comes the band's 7th album.<br /><br />\\"El Camino\\" (11 tracks; 38 min.) continues the band's \\"commercialization\\" started on \\"Brothers\\" and as a result this really doesn't sound much anymore like the early days of the band. The days of \\"Thickfreakness\\" are long gone! After a couple of interesting opening tracks, the album takes full flight starting with \\"Run Right Back\\", an irrestable song which reminds me of an older song (but which one?), and the same with the next several tunes, all one better than the next: \\"Sister\\", \\"Hell of A Season\\", \\"Stop Stop\\", and \\"Nova Baby\\". The last track \\"Mind Eraser\\" seems tagged on to remind us that yes, this band once was a bluesy garage band. Elements of garage rock, Led Zeppelin, glam rock, Motown, they are all here. At 38 min., this album clips by in no time, and you'll find yourself playing this again and again. As a long-time fan of the band I am amazed at the transformation, but all I can say is that this album is simply a blast.<br /><br />I had the good fortune of seeing the Black Keys here in Cincinnati 2 weeks ago on the opening night of their US arena tour. I was floored that the US Bank Arena was sold out (16,000 fans or so), having seen this guys perform at the Southgate House for several hundred fans back in 2004. But no matter, they put on a blazing show, playing all but a few songs as a four-some, and it was a fantastic show, playing about 6 or 7 songs each from this album and from \\"Brothers\\", along with some older nuggets. Great night of music. Meanwhile, \\"El Camino\\" is highly recommended for old and new Black Keys fans alike!

B00715SUI6|3.0|The first Paranormal Activity was great, even after a long line of first person style of shooting. Blaire Witch set the standards and a few other competent films have followed. Paranormal the First created a new precedent of special effects, seemingly before your eyes. Whether its all post-edit computer effects can be argued, but the result is effective.<br /><br />The second installment seemed to rest on the hype alone and had no real follow-up from the first. I am not even sure if was the same house. Which dulls any later attempts because now the idea of what became Paranormal is not just random acts of ghostly stuff. One can get the same benefit from Discover Channel's \\"A Haunting\\".<br /><br />With the third installment, again, its another family. No history of anything is recalled or brought into play. This film has a larger family. A husband, wife and two daughters. Why these hauntings occur does not ever surface. The husband notices things and so this justifies him placing cameras in the house. The mother refuses to view any of it, so naturally she never spots anything. Throughout, her daughter talks to a Toby, which she believes is her daughters imaginary friend and says its a passing phase for a few weeks. We learn that Toby is the evil spirit behind all the happenings.<br /><br />Thats really the essence of the story. From that we are treated with some scary and creepy moments of ghostly raptures, telekinetic activity, other such nuisances. I believe some back story would create a deeper and emotional scare rather than just shock scares. My problem with handheld camera movies is that, almost under no circumstances to do these people relieve themselves of the camera for something as dire as surviving or protecting their loved ones. Towards the end, we see the mother in a situation, and the husband, while asking if she is ok, continues to hold the camera. We know she is in trouble, and he is not exactly in a safe spot either. I say \\"drop the camera!!\\" I know it's all for effect, but the realism is removed in those instances. This is not the only film that does that, but I still get pulled out of the movie or lose sympathy for the people.<br /><br />Paranormal still has scary and creepy moments that will sure make it a worthwhile viewing. And I say it is worth seeing. For all intents and purposes it is a well done film that is probably just as scary as the previous bunch.it's all for effect, but the realism is removed in those instances.

B005URRCUY|4.0|Another great CD from the Black Keys. Back to the basics punchy sound, quirky lyrics and great guitar work. Thoroughly enjoyable to listen to at home through my sound system, during subway commutes, in the car or during staff meetings (just kidding). I still buy CD's and I think that this is an essential part of my collection. The only negative is the somewhat raspy and flat sounding lead vocals. While guitars and drums are well recorded and mixed, the lead vocals sound like they were recorded in garageband with a cheap microphone hanging from the rafters. Danger Mouse, are your mouse ears losing it?
B004RLN3QG|5.0|When I look for something to listen to, what I seek out is often far from the mainstream monotony of minimal talent, recycled riffs, and lazy production.  I search for inspired artists with music in their blood and a story to tell.  Most modern music seems either pretentious or cookie cutter.  What a relief \\"Dust Bowl\\" is.  Harmony, heart, story, and passion... this album has it all.  It is as if Job \\"B\\" said to himself \\"I think I'm going to take some bluesy Joplin, soulful Vaugn, the story telling of Springsteen, mixed with the sass of Cash and W. Nelson toss it in a blender then mix it on a record.\\"  Is this music on par for the forementioned?... well perhaps not.  But the pieces put together in this album are darn near brilliant.  Whether you listen to it sippin on a beer in the garage, a glass of wine on the deck, or if you are just a teenager chillin with gigantic phones on your ears desperate for inspiration... This album is for you.  Well worth the price!

B00005JLEU|5.0|I've been introducing my seven-year-old to several of Studio Ghibli offerings, such as [[ASIN:B002ZTQVLG Kiki's Delivery Service]], [[ASIN:B000CDGVOE Howl's Moving Castle]], [[ASIN:B002ZTQV8Y My Neighbor Totoro]], [[ASIN:B002ZTQVGQ Ponyo]], and more recently [[ASIN:B005G0919K Studio Ghibli: The Borrower Arrietty DVD (Licensed boxed version, Japanese audio version with Eng Sub)]]. I held off on showing her Spirited Away until today because I felt some elements such as the spirit world would be too scary for her until now.<br /><br />She watched it with me this afternoon and loved it! Before showing this to her, I explained some elements of Asian folklore (I am originally from Southeast Asia and could relate to some of the folklore underlying this story) so she could follow the story better, though this is not strictly necessary, especially for older viewers.<br /><br />Spirited Away follows the adventures of 10-year-old Chihiro who together with her parents is making a move from the city to the suburbs. Chihiro is not very happy about this move, and when her parents accidentally find themselves off the beaten path on their way to their new home, she discourages them from exploring. Chihiro has a strange sense of foreboding that this new place which her father presumes to be an abandoned theme park is much more than that and she is of course proven right. Her parents are turned into pigs after gorging on food they found at this place, which turns out to be inhabited by the spirit world.<br /><br />In Asian folklore, there is an emphasis on respecting old superstitions, which includes belief in the spirit world inhabited by the Gods and otherworldly creatures. When Chihiro's parents gorged on food meant for the spirits, they were being very disrespectful and so are punished accordingly. The rest of the story follows Chihiro's efforts, aided by the loyal Haku, to redeem her parents and make their escape from the malevolent witch Yubaba who rules over this world.<br /><br />The animation is simply amazing and conjures up a fantastical world of odd-looking creatures (that radish spirit was just out of this world!) in an alternate world that is vividly brought to life. The animation is superior but what makes this such a memorable film is the heartfelt story with its underlying theme of respect, loyalty,friendship, trust, and sacrifice. Chihiro's relentless efforts to save her parents credibly portrays the theme of filial piety and her courage and determination make her a true heroine, serving as a great role model for children. This is a film to be enjoyed by viewers of all ages, and I am so glad that I have the opportunity to share this remarkable film with my own child. P.S. Watch out for deals on Studio Ghibli films here on Amazon, as the prices tend to drop and I've been able to amass my very own Ghibli collection!r />The animation is simply amazing and conjures up a fantastical world of odd-looking creatures (that radish spirit was just out of this world!) in an alternate world that is vividly brought to life.

B0070Z97LG|3.0|I am truly surprised that the people behind the production of Dream House went along with the trailer for the movie - it spoils the movie for the viewer! I watched the trailer months ago when the movie was first released in theaters, and was shocked at how blatantly the storyline was exposed, leaving the viewer with no sense of anticipation as to what may be the mystery of Dream House. I was so disappointed (I am a fan of both Weisz and Craig) that I opted not to watch the movie in the theater and waited for it to be available as a DVD rental.<br /><br />Since I had already watched the trailer, I sort of knew what to expect and was proven right. There are no big surprises or plot twists for those who were unfortunate enough to have viewed the movie trailer. For those who haven't watched the trailer, the movie will hold some surprises, but not anything new in the haunted house and psychological thriller genre. The plot is predictable, and it is only the performances of the lead actors that keep the entire production from falling apart. Unfortunately, even the combined star power of Daniel Craig, Rachel Weisz, and Naomi Watts fail to keep this from turning into an awful mess of a movie.<br /><br />The story centers on a man named Will Attenton (Daniel Craig) who at the beginning of the movie is shown giving up his successful editorial job so that he can spend more time working on his novel and having quality time with his family - wife Libby (Rachel Weisz) and two young daughters. Things start to go wrong when Will begins to think someone may be watching his family, and then makes the discovery that his house was the scene of violent crimes involving the murders of an entire family. He also wonders if there is a connection between what happened in the past, what he is experiencing in the present, and the role of the attractive neighbor across the street (Naomi Watts).<br /><br />The story starts off on a relatively strong note - the atmosphere (beautiful snow, an idyllic suburban street), the sense of suspense being gradually built up, but then it all sort of falls apart into a mess.

0307352145|5.0|No amount of soul searching has helped me more to understand myself than this book.  Prior to reading the book, I understood the MBTI classifications and model; in fact, I use the model to navigate the world of people I interact with on a daily basis.  However, it was only after reading this book, that I finally started to appreciate my gifts, preferences and all people around me.  .
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I bought this collection of novellas on a recommendation and agree with the earlier reviewer who says this is destined to be a sci fi classic.  In a compact story, there is a tightly wound plot with well-developed characters.  One of the aspects I liked best was that even the antagonists had real motivations and were legitimately trying to do what they thought was right.
B005EM8O8O|3.0|I'm a retired stockbroker so I don't really know if the book would be confusing for someone who is not as knowledgable about the subject as I am. It was very interesting and suspenseful however I was mildly disappointed with the ending. I don't want to spoil it for anyone by describing exactly why but read it and see if you don't feel the same. Maybe there is a sequel in the works? I very much enjoyed reading it and could hardly put it down.
0441009425|4.0|Alastair Reynolds' novel \\"Revelation Space\\" manages a complex, intelligent plot that occurs over 30 years in separate parts of the galaxy bringing them together for an explosive climax.<br /><br />While Reynolds' novel does have its flaws (it might be hard for some people to keep track of the various subplots that often occur years apart but are placed next to each other as if they are occurring at the same time. It might have been helpful to have chapter titles telling us WHEN and WHERE each portion takes place), his ambitious story, his imagination and characters carry the day.<br /><br />SPOILERS:<br /><br />Archaeologist Dan Sylveste discovers the reminants of an ancient civilization that humans have named the Amarantin. These bird-like creatures lost the ability to fly developing more like bipeds with time and eventually returned to flight reaching the starsQ briefly before their civilization was destroyed. Sylveste who survived an encounter with another alien civilization at the edge of space called The Shroud came back a changed man. Sylveste desperately seeks the reasons WHY the civilization was destroyed from what appears to be an outside force convinced that it may be coming for humanity as well.<br /><br />Ana Khouri a former soldier and assassin takes on an assignment unwillingly to infiltrate the cyborg crew of the Nostalgia for Infinity. Her assignment--KILL Sylveste before he discovers anymore about the Amarantins, saves the ill captain of the ship and, perhaps, bring humanity one step closer to destruction.<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS:<br /><br />As mentioned Reynolds book tends to jump around quite a bit. The paperback edition of the book doesn't help as some of the chapter breaks between various subplots appear to be missing with the paragraphs running together (maybe it's just my copy). Still, Reynolds' ambitious and imagintagive story captures your interest but you may have to devote yourself a bit more here compared to lighter science fiction novels out there. In many respects, the sprawling storyline reminds me of Frank Herbert's \\"Dune\\" when it was first introduced in that the book challenges the reader to stay with a less conventional narrative.<br /><br />Despite the fact that the structure of the story with the subplots that occur decades apart may take some getting used to, \\"Revelation Space\\" demonstrates Reynolds imagination as a world building storyteller. I would recommend reading the first three or four chapters online if you can to see if this will be a novel for you. The book could have been edited by abo it 100 pages and not siuffered for it.els out there.

The storage for the 8 films are in a compact casing, take little room and seems to be of good quality.<br />Way to go Amazon!

B002ZG98Z0|1.0|It's strange to me that anyone might look to Amazon for a review of this movie, since Rotten Tomatoes might tell you all you need to know (or seeing the trailer should have the same effect.) but if you're still with me, here goes.<br /><br />I used to be a fan of the show, like so many other women - it's a guilty pleasure. It was half an hour and went down easily enough (surely there's a Samantha joke in there somewhere...) and then somehow, peer pressure sucked me into the black void of seeing the first movie. Fine, I saw it. Sob sob, screwed up wedding, blah blah blah.<br /><br />Consequently I avoided Sucks in the City 2 because, well, enough already. The trailers were just dreck. After a point, all the characters are so unbelievably annoying it's hard to stomach even for a former fan. But the HBO sucked me into watching just a few minutes of this (okay, more like 70) and I could not look away because I loved HATING it so much. It wasn't easy watching the 4 hags warble their way through karaoke \\"I Am Woman, Hear Me Roar\\" (no easy feat for even Helen Reddy herself) but it was just so horrifically bad it was like watching a fashionable train wreck unfold (fewer fatalities, but ungodly expensive outfits). I can't imagine even fans of the show liked this movie, it was that appallingly bad. I suspect the movie got made because someone lost a bet. The weak attempts at jokes never landed...even once - I shuddered more than laughed, by far.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT: Like you can't see it coming, they eventually get ejected from Abu Dhabi for Samantha being...wait for it - a whore. Despite numerous warnings from her shrew crew, Samantha whores it up in fine whoring fashion and they all have to flee the country before hotel bills and jail time descend upon them. See it if you want (to despise it) but by now I hope someone has punched the director in the grundle, on general principle.

There is a way to change your life.  Even if you don't have the strength, having the information is half the battle.  Worth every penny.

B003YOMN68|5.0|Another excellent recorded performance from Bill Evans. Look, if you have any interest in Bill Evans, just start buying all of his acoustic piano albums. All are excellent. This one is one of the best. But, that really does not matter - once you \\"get it\\" (Bill Evans, that is) you will probably need to buy all of his recorded output, at least up to about 1965. Here is my advice; load your shopping cart up with every single recorded performance by Bill Evans from 1959 to 1965 and buy them all on CD.

B005OZ4E3A|5.0|Registrazione di alta qualit&agrave;, a base di composto di olio di pesce. Laura Pausini ha questi meloni bellissimi, ma non ci sono foto di loro nella copertina dell'album. Il Musci &egrave; eccellente, in modo da poter acquistare record di te per questo.<br /><br />I have found that all of Laura Pausini's recordings are worthwhile. She has a strong voice, competent song choices, and very good production. Overall, a paradigm of modern music excellence. If you enjoy good female vocals, music ranging from ballads to middle of the road to rock (all very tastefully done), you will find something to enjoy on this recording.<br /><br />I recommend this album, as well as [[ASIN:B000IY04OU Io Canto]] , [[ASIN:B001GRTPMU Primavera in Anticipo (Italian Version)]], and [[ASIN:B0006419QY Resta in Ascolto]]. Any of these recording is excellent. I understand very little Italian, and that does not detract from my enjoyment of these recordings at all. I suggest that you give any of these a try to broaden your muscial horizons a bit. I can easily predict that you will buy the others after hearing any one of these fine recordings.
B005QYKE2Y|5.0|This movie is a simply an action movie.  It has the explosions, the cars, and the drama of an action movie and not much else.  But then again, how much more do you need for a entertaining movie?  With the level of graphics, a blu-ray is especially nice.

I would have rated this a minus- star if I could.  What a pack of lawyers The Boss ( of thieves) must have to get away with this. For shame--you'd think Bruce has been around long enough to have a little r-e-s-p-e-c-t!
B002RKRGQ2|3.0|Right Ho, Jeeves  .  .  .  .  .  P G Wodehouse<br /><br />This is one of a number of \\"Jeeves\\" novels by P G Wodehouse . It epitomizes Wodehouse's unique brand of humor.  I think one has to be in the correct  mood to truly appreciate the \\"Jeeves\\" tales. This book was my first exposure to the series and I was expecting something quite different. So my review (3 star) is based on my mood at the time. I think my review of the next \\"Jeeves\\" novel might be higher, because I'll be in the right mood and judge it strictly on it's merits as that type of book
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|The show introduced me to the incredible books that I haven't been able to stop reading. I am so glad that HBO did this fantastic adaptation. It is always so thrilling when the talents of the directors and the cast combine with skilled filmography to create a world as mesmerizing as the works that inspired them. I cannot wait for more!

B000005RTQ|5.0|I recently bought the original American release on vinyl and understood why it couldn't really happen for the band.<br />Just one thing such as opening song- Sailing To America, which maybe not a bad song, but it is lacking everything that establish Saxon as a heavy metal act. It is sad. Would you listen to the album if you did not know anything about the band? I am not sure. It was also recorded in States, which doesn't help a lot, sounds more like Twisted Sister. Still it is great that even almost 30 years later, american consumer could buy the proper version of this otherwise pretty good record. Check out band's latest albums. They are fantastic.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think its a great game but could be better by the quality and how it look but other wise it is a great game

B006P0FIB0|5.0|The movie opens with a brief historical background. Europe is in turmoil and only three French superheroes can save it!<br /><br />As the main characters are introduced we get a quick feel for the movie that it will be light, humorous, Indian Jones adventurous, with our heroes emulating superheroes as they enter the secret vault of Da Vinci to steal his invention plan for the \\"war machine\\" which looks like an airship. Heart throb Olando Bloom who would have made the idea Aramis, plays a bad guy, The Duke of Buckingham. Aramis is instead played by Luke Evans. Milla Jovovich, stars as Milady de Winter the double agent, the love of Athos (Matthew Macfadyen) and Orlando Bloom. Ray Stevenson is a delightful Porthos which we don't get to see enough on the screen. D'Artagnan (Logan Lerman) enters town looking for adventure on his odd looking horse named \\"Buttercup\\" which is not very manly, even in France.<br /><br />D'Artagnan wants to join up with the trio, which due to budget cuts and the control of the evil Cardinal Richelieu (Christoph Waltz) has been dissolved. Through various circumstances they are joined together and have a new quest. Milla plays a woman who is skilled with the sword. Her slo-mo moves which she perfected in Resident Evil combat are used in this film. Likewise the foursome fight overwhelming odds.<br /><br />Gabriella Wilde, plays Constance, a lady in waiting who has the heart of D'Artagnan. She delivers to them their impossible quest, one with little chance of success, having to fight and elude armies in two countries. A negative aspect of the film is the anachronistic warship which gave the movie an uncomfortable \\"Wild Wild West\\" feeling, perhaps for the teen appeal. RPG type fighting. Don't look for too much Dumas in this film.<br /><br />Great movie for the big screen. Good dialogue.<br /><br />No F-bombs, nudity, or sex. Appears to be kid safe.

B0068RHSZO|4.0|Will, who is an editor, is quitting his job so he can spend more time with his family in a newly purchased dream house. He spends most of his time locked up in his room writing. Rachel Weisz is the mom and they have 2 giggling/screaming daughters. There are things which happen in and around the house...the daughter claims there was a face in her window...dad finds footprints outside...the neighborhood teens play in his basement because this was the home to a man who killed his family. Now with the footprints...he is back!<br /><br />In order to get information he goes to the local coffee shop and asks some cops stuffing their face.(I didn't write this stuff.) Peter Ward, the father, survived the massacre and everyone in town believes he is a psycho killer...<br /><br />And then things escalate...<br /><br />This is an excellent movie. We have seen various aspects of this movie done before and to mention it, or to compare it to another film would ruin it. If you like a good pyschological thriller with a twist, watch this film without reading the reviews or the box. Well acted. Well written.<br /><br />No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.

Their ineffective solution is to constantly reboot the app from the cloud, which does nothing. Get for fun but don't put $ into it and save free gems at beginning of game to get stuff you cant get with earned coins.  If you get REALLY frustrated when someone rips you off at the store, you will want to pass this one up.

0375869026|5.0|This is an extremely well written book about a child who is different and struggling to fit in to a world that rejects him. It is an easy read for 6th grade and above. Parents should read first or with children to create conversations about the bullying sceens and the problems the main character faces.<br /><br />The character development and plot are excellent. The story is about a child with a severe deformity of the face who after being home schooled because of surgeries etc, must now face children and teachers in a real school. The child needs to leave the protection of his very small world and learn to face society, and let society face him. It is not easy as the deformity is great.<br /><br />however, without magic or super powers - just compassion and understanding, he matures as does his friends that he makes along the way. He conquers his fears and his friends learn what being human really means.<br /><br />This would be an excellent book for teachers to use in the classroom.

However, the sound is awesome and the price is unbeatable.  Even if they only last me six months, I'd probably buy them again.  Great fit for small ears, and they don't budge A BIT even when you're running.

0060873027|1.0|Do not waste your money on this book. It is the worst book I have ever read. The writing is incompetent. The plot isn't even good enough for a bad comic book. The characters are not fleshed out well at all. The heroine in this book, as in other Crichton books, is intelligent, but takes terribly stupid chances. No other character comes close to acting like a human being when faced with every day and sometimes fantastic stimuli.<br /><br />I can't imagine a book that could possibly be a worse read. Crichton and Preston have set the bar very low for all books. In protest, I didn't read the last 5% of this book, because I had to cut my losses.

B003H9M1QM|4.0|Dumbo is an American Classic. The big eared elephant is a wonderful addition to anyone's Disney collection. It's a cute film, but the Bluray update is nothing to write home about. The only reason I gave this movie four stars, instead of three, is because Dumbo doesn't translate that well to Bluray. It's hardly better than the original. They did what they could and it looks great, but it has the same quality as DVD. Still, the price is the same for both Bluray and DVD.
B002SRQ214|5.0|This processor is a great buy for the money, and I see huge differences from my previous AMD Athlon II x2 265 3.3 ghz processor. For the price you can't really find a better quad core processor. It might not be as fast as some of the Intel quads, but the price difference is fairly significant for some. Definitely a great buy for someone like me who was looking to do a bargain build and still grab some serious performance at a good price. You can definitely save some money here to put into other aspects of your build i.e. video card, etc. without having to worry about losing processing performance.<br /><br /> For all the complaints about the Stock Cooler it's not bad. It's a CoolerMaster. They are a proven brand and rock solid. The Heat Sink is Aluminum with Copper Piping (I was surprised to see Copper on a Stock Cooler). The Fan moves plenty of air, but at the cost of being noisy.<br /><br /> I've overclocked it to 3.8 ghz and it does get hot. When its stock the cooler is ok but if your going to overclock like me you better get an after market cooler.
B00005J6SZ|5.0|Madonna's second album was scheduled for a 1984 summer release but was shelved for the Christmas market so that Sire Records could continue mining hits from \\"Madonna\\" the first album, which was still experiencing strong sales due to \\"Borderline\\" and \\"Lucky Star\\" being in heavy rotation on MTV and the other music-video TV programs. While \\"Madonna\\" was an excellent debut and really captured the hedonistic spirit of the New York dance scene in the early '80s, by teaming up with veteran producer Nile Rogers, Madonna delivered my favorite album of hers of the decade (and third fave overall--behind \\"Music\\" and \\"Erotica\\"). What makes \\"Virgin\\" so much better than M's other '80s output is that even the non-singles are terrific, unlike the terrible filler found on \\"True Blue\\" like \\"Jimmy Jimmy\\" and \\"Loves Makes the World Go Round\\".<br /><br />Rogers shades the album with a deliciously decadent, sophisticated-sounding pop-gloss that is the musical equivalent of silk sheets or expensive chocolates. This is especially evident on the love-gone-wrong numbers (\\"Pretender\\", \\"Love Don't Live Here Anymore\\") or where Madonna professes her undying devotion (\\"Shoo-Be-Doo\\", \\"Stay\\"). The production all-around is classy and flawless with lots of gorgeous, plucky strings and razor-sharp drumming.<br /><br />If anything deserves to sound out-of-place here, it's the opening number. \\"Material Girl\\" has Madonna in the Betty Boop mode that would serve her well on later fare like \\"Santa Baby\\" and much of the \\"Dick Tracy\\" soundtrack. Still a catchy tune over 25 years later, I do admit it's probably my least favorite here due to overexposure. The title track doesn't get near as much airplay on retro stations these days as her other '80s hits, yet it's still one of the decades best female singles IMO. And I do prefer the original, uncluttered version here rather than the one with unnecessary bells and chimes that appeared on \\"The Immaculate Collection\\".<br /><br />The remaining two tracks are fantastic slices of dance-pop. \\"Over and Over\\" is a rousing anthem for perseverance, but to truly appreciate it, I recommend you seek out the blistering extended remix found on \\"You Can Dance\\". The classy dance number \\"Dress You Up\\" was remixed for radio with a dated synthesized drum roll, but the original here with its fantastic four-beat opening is the only one you need to hear.<br /><br />The original 12-inch versions of \\"Material Girl\\" and \\"Like a Virgin\\" are included as bonus cuts. While \\"Material\\" has enough tweaks to make it interesting, \\"Virgin\\" should have been replaced with the 12-inch version of \\"Angel\\" which was remixed to sound like a live recording.<br /><br />This is the album that made Madonna a superstar. It allowed her to grow as an artist as her vocals display a wider range and proved she could handle the ballads when called upon.

068484267X|5.0|One of the best books of the 1990s-this beautifully written memoir tells of the suffering of a poverty stricken childhood in Ireland of the 1930s and 40s-written in such a way that it captures the sadness of the suffering of the family, and yet retains a seismic wit that will make you cry and laugh in turn.<br /><br />Always written from the point of view of the child and teenager Frankie, at the age he is at the time, never from the perspective of an older man looking back, this is a book you wont want to put down and will stay with you forever.<br />This book takes you from the eraluest memories of the auhtor as a toddler to the angst and burgeoning sexuality of his teens.<br /><br />Frank is the son of a alcoholic father who squanders the few wages he ever gets on drink (while making his children swear to die for Ireland), and a mother who struggles to keep the family together. It begins with his life until he is four in New York during the Great Depression, and then the family's return to the greater depression of their homeland, Ireland, where they live on a tiny government dole, and the charity of begrudging relatives.<br /><br />what makes this memoir so compelling is how the author juggles the different emotions, always with a ready wit, which makes this book a  classic, and yet always at the same time displaying to pathos and misery of the Ireland of this era.<br /><br />McCourt describes the loss of his baby sisters with heart wrenching realism. He has three more brothers, the more charming and easy going Malachy, the king hearted Michael who brings home beggars and stray dogs to the family's humble abode, and the youngest Alphie.<br /><br />Always pervasive is the grinding poverty, the oppressive and guilt-inducing all pervading presence of the Catholic church and education system ,and the fierce patriotism and resentment at Realm of the time of the 800 years of English domination and cruelty.<br /><br />But what always shines through is the refusal to forget the humour and hope, the appreciation of small things and nature, through such crushing circumstances, and always the hope. The memoir closes with the realization of Frank's dream and goal to emigrate back to the America of his birth. Ultimately it is a book of the life of life, and refusal to ever be sunk by circumstances-what makes it more inspiring is a true life story of the authors' childhood.rget the humour and hope, the appreciation of small things and nature, through such crushing circumstances, and always the hope.

0955153077|5.0|After my book arrived, I was excited to see what this book offered and what I can say is that this book is well worth the buy for beginners. The book provides fundamental information, from learning your work-space around Photoshop (I have CS4 but I was still able to navigate around PS regardless)to the techniques and the amount of practice that the book describes. Personally, the most interesting chapter of the book is speed painting which provides a way to speed paint (no pun intended) conceptual art. I appreciated fluid and form of each composition that is digitally painted to grab your attention on the amount of detail. Hence, this book is a great way for practicing that technique.<br /><br />The book may be a little short on techniques but that's just minor problem for a beginner's guide and that is where their other books come in handy. Moreover, it is a the 1st volume of the Beginner's Guide series so there's bound to be even more techniques and practice.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />+ Content<br />+ Organization<br />+ Comprehensive Guide<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />None.<br /><br />Overall, this book is a great way to get started on Digital Painting in Photoshop. A fully comprehensive step-by-step guide to help you become a good, if not better, digital painter.
B004LWZW9C|4.0|Although the critics slammed \\"New Year's Eve\\" as one of the worst movies of the year, the audiences felt differently rather enjoying it.  I kind of liked it.  Nice fluff.  It's an ensemble cast set up just like in \\"Valentine's Day\\" except this one is on \\"New Year's Eve\\".  Some of the pairings include, Sarah Jessica Parker & Abigail Breslin who play Mother and Daughter offering one of the more bouncier & interesting pairings in the film.  Josh Duhamel searches diligently for his soul mate he met & lost one year ago.  Jessica Biel & Seth Meyers play husband and wife in one of the more unnecessary subplots in the film.  Robert DeNiro & Halle Berry manage to bring deep emotion into the lackluster words printed on the script thus making it believable.  Katherine Heigl & Sofia Vergara give us light comic relief in their bits.<br /><br />Despite the critics attacks on the film they do manage to praise one tiny element within each of their scathing reviews.  They loved the Michelle Pfieffer - Zac Efron sequences, more or less calling it the film's saving grace.  I agree.  I could've watched the entire movie with just them and be fine.  If only the entire movie could've surfaced around their characters.  They were the only actors that actually developed and fleshed out the roles they were playing as much as they could.  It ended up being the surprising charm behind the film and thus allowing me to give it one more star necessary just for them.<br /><br />Most of us have guilty pleasures and we want to escape the stresses, depressions and feelings of isolation in our lives and simply escape into a fantasy.  \\"New Year's Eve\\" can accomplish that.<br /><br />The film is a completely unrealistic and contrived world, yet it's bright, fun and full of love. There are many out there exhausted with fighting our day to day battles and watching another overblown shoot 'em up movie with no point.  If you get depressed over the holiday season or are completely stressed out and over it all and everyone in it, then I would recommend watching \\"New Year's Eve\\" as it is an uplifter despite it being like a gigantic Hallmark card.and everyone in it, then I would recommend watching \\"New Year's Eve\\" as it is an uplifter despite it being like a gigantic Hallmark card.

B0063T12RM|5.0|I've never been entirely convinced by Wim Wenders as a narrative film director-- his talents have always been more situated in the realm of conceptual art than that of the storyteller.  Here he gets a chance to apply his conceptual art strengths to one of the few great artists of our time, Pina Bausch.  The results are often startling, enthralling, and affirmative.<br /><br />The opening excerpt from Bausch's RITE OF SPRING ranks as one of the greatest pieces of filmmaking I've ever seen.  There is no doubt that Wenders has found the best possible use for 3D.  To be frank, I would have preferred to see the entire performance rather than the documentary which enfolds it, but ideally we can have both (hint to distributors: there are at least five DVDs to be gleaned from the various dances here.  I'd buy all of them!!)<br /><br />The central section of the film includes excerpts from Bausch's more cerebral work, and it is here that perhaps the film is less effective.  While the work itself is absolutely fascinating, the series of tableaux which Wenders constructs breaks the spell essential to fully entering Bausch's world.  On the other hand, Wenders does create some extraordinary moments possible only through film-- by, for example, intercutting between dancers of various ages-- thus participating in the creative process and making the film itself a document keeping Bausch alive.<br /><br />Meanwhile, we get- a la \\"A Chorus Line,\\"  the dancers themselves, introduced in close ups Avedon would have been proud of.  This device is interesting, if not, perhaps, in the end, terribly well integrated.  Threading through the film as a leitmotif we get a processional that reminded me of the end of 8 1/2 (A.O. Scott cites \\"The Seventh Seal,\\" which also suggested itself to me).  It works (we are reassured that the stream of energy Bausch left behind remains) but these cinematic gestures don't approach the brilliance of the work celebrated by the film itself (which is just as it should be, I suppose).<br /><br />All in all, not one of the greatest documentaries of all time, but absolutely essential, nonetheless.  Magnificent!

It is not my favorite Crichton novel, but it was a fun read. Definitely worth the time!

0439023513|2.0|Three final book in the trilogy did not hold up to the previous two.  The overall plot was good, that in a world of humans, evil exists everywhere, even among those we think are good.  Ther are similarities on both sides, though one side will view their way as right, though engaging in similar activities.<br /><br />However, beyond the plot, this was terrible.  Boring.  The internal female drama was excessive and tiring.  I felt trapped while some unexplained story happened.  Characters who were developed one way of a something became something different.  In the face of extreme hardship and difficulty, even with her life at risk, Katniss had been focused and cool headed.  She became quite hysterical, a raving lunatic.<br /><br />The first book I read in one long evening.  The second in a little more than a day.  The third is a struggle and takes will power just to keep reading.
B005NKGEP2|4.0|Fun, well researched places and characters mostly consistent with their developed personalities which included some rough and accurate spycraft. But the end gives in to  American morality and conduct which I did not find believable. The  whole last chapter of course always the hardest, felt bad only because of the very end,especially the lack of monetary motive and the exaggerated nastiness between some different agency personnel and the assumption they could get away with it. Share the wealth, it was well earned by all. Sits better with what happened in my opinion.

B0069GRIHW|5.0|No this one isn't just another reissue of the well known album but also one for the discerning Doors fans and collectors, the 2 CD triple fold out set featuring as it does, alongside the original album, different versions of 7 of the 10 tunes (exceptions being \\"Hyacinth House\\" (unfortunately as it is a beautiful song), \\"L'America\\" and \\"Crawling King Snake\\").  There's  also the image of Morrison crucified on a telegraph pole included with the early original vinyl issue on a poster and on the inner sleeve (referred to here as \\"Electric Woman\\").<br />They were all recorded in The Doors Workshop at the time of the \\"LA Woman\\" sessions (hence the title of the double vinyl edition, \\"The Workshop Sessions\\" (which features only the alternate versions but doesn't appear to be widely available at present).  The quality of the alternative versions is, as one would expect, excellent of course and I'm surprised that they have never appeared before though that's probably down to the cynical record company penchant for making maximum money off old material (not that I am a cynic myself, you understand).<br /><br />Enough has been said about the original album so I'll concentrate here on the alternative versions.  I haven't actually compared any of them to the originals, merely listened to the unreleased ones and said what comes to mind, but I can say with certainty that most of the alternate versions are less polished than those used on the album and, indeed, sound at times like demos at times rather than alternate takes or versions.  One does, in fact, mention the take number, which probably means that none of them are actually demos.  Studio chat features too.<br /><br />\\"The Changeling\\", which Jim tells the band is his favourite number, is longer at nearly 5 minutes and powers along at around the same speed as the album version but with a different keyboard riff.  It is, perhaps, more powerful and certainly bluesier with more raucous lead guitar.  A few bum notes slip in but donot spoil the overall feel of the song.<br /><br />\\"Love Her Madly\\" features a lazier Morrison vocal with different lyrics and a totally different keyboard section in the middle.<br />\\"Been Down So Long\\" is probably the least different alternative, much the same as the album version apart from being a bit rougher and longer.<br />The slow, dirty, blues of \\"Cars Hiss by My Window\\" seems to feature somewhat more prominent guitar than the LP version and is 30 seconds longer.<br /><br />\\"LA Woman\\" meanwhile features different lead guitar riffs and a weird bit of extra vocalising brings it to a sudden end at 8.45.<br /><br />\\"The WASP (Texas Radio and the Big Beat)\\" features different lyrics and is 1.20 longer than the album version but this comprises a cacophony of jazzy guitar and drums with no discernible tune.  There's an instrumental version thrown in too.<br /><br />Clocking in at 2 minutes longer than the original, \\"Riders on the Storm\\" could have been the jewel in the crown here, were it not for the fact that the extra time is occupied by a throw away Morrison ditty, false start and chat occupying the first 2 minutes plus a somewhat flat Morrison vocal, especially evident at the start of the tune proper.<br /><br />Finally, music-wise, you get the addition of an actual unreleased song, \\"She Smells so Nice\\", which morphs into \\"Rock Me\\", but both are pretty much of filler or single B side standard and it`s no wonder they were not used on the \\"LA Woman\\" album proper or indeed anywhere else.<br /><br />The 3-way fold-out card sleeve packaging features, in addition to the original album artwork, 3 photos from the \\"LA Woman\\" sessions and, as mentioned earlier, a replica of the striking image of a naked Morrison crucified on a telegraph pole that came as a poster and on the inner of early copies the original vinyl LP (though it's referred to as \\"Electric Woman\\" on a vinyl set packaging sticker I always understood it to be Morrison and it does look like it could be him).<br /><br />As stated earlier the 2 LP 180 gram vinyl version features only the alternative versions spread over 3 sides.  The lyrics of the original versions of the alternative songs are etched onto side 4.  The gatefold sleeve features a largely white mock up of the LA Woman sleeve with recording details, credits and the crucified Jim image.  At £17 to £19, 3 sides of music in a gatefold sleeve seems like pretty good value.  Buy it this way if you still have a record deck and do not want another copy of \\"LA Woman\\" on CD.<br /><br />Now all that is needed is for alternative versions of songs from their other albums to be unearthed and issued in these formats.

B0052UZIFA|1.0|I loved this app in my HTC Incredible, but it will not load on my Incredible2.  The app starts, I see an hour glass, and then it closes immediately.  Please fix!
B006LS7DQE|4.0|Puzzle Quest 2 is a full blown Puzzle RPG, the best of the genre. Bejeweled gameplay mixed with your warrior killing bad goblins and witches. Plenty of items, new spells, and fun twists. Dozens of hours can go into this game easily. Especially if you wish to play through again and again to have fun with the four different classes. Game is a little buggy though, closes randomly sometimes. The true con is how much space this game takes up. Around 250 MB's out of your 5 GB's is okay. But on Kindle Fires, they have the \\"app storage\\" area that only has a little over 1 GB. Puzzle Quest 2 takes up over 200 mb's of that space up. 25+% of your app storage space to one game. And when you get to about 80-90% of this space taken up, your have a never-leaving notification that the device may perform less. My device just maxed this space out, and it wouldn't let me leave the page until I deleted a bunch of games to clear the space up. So I've been forced to delete puzzle quest 2 from my kindle fire.<br />In conclusion, if you have a Kindle Fire to play lots of games, watch lots of videos, etc. then this game will hurt your valuable space.<br />If you only use the Fire for browsing the web and reading a book, play a casual game here and there, then this is a great addition.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|could not put it down! An amazing story! A great read for both teens and adults! Hope they don't ruin it with the movie.
0385342063|5.0|I aak a big fan of Sofia kinsella's books and this defiantly did not disappoint me. It was by far one of the funniest most interesting books of hers and out of all the books I have read. There were many times I was literally laughing out loud. It kept me guessing till the end.  I recommend it to everyone I have seen since I read it. No complaints.
B0061QD82E|5.0|It came in the mail just in time for valintines day.  We gave it to my daughter.  The package was in in great condition.  She watches it often.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this is great if you like to play solitaire.  no lamer adds during game play.  just a quick one that pops up when the cards are dealt and thats it.

B0010SKSTO|5.0|I've always been a fairly quiet person. While everyone else talks I've always watched and listened. Growing up silent you learn a lot about how people think, the types of connections they make, and the way their social and individual behaviors differ. While I had been an observer for many years, this book was a great way to cross check what I believed about body language from my observations with true documentation from a credible expert. It was very easy to read, engaging so I wanted to keep reading, and had a lot of useful information that gave me interesting insights not just into other people but into myself as well.<br /><br />The benefits of a book like this are obvious to those who need it, so I wont waste any time diving into what body language is good for. And with the plethora of other reviews I'll let them give more general information about the book. Instead I'll jump straight to what I found to be the most interesting parts of this book.<br /><br />If you've always been pretty good at reading people, this book might shed some interesting light on how and from where some of your observations come. Before pieces of data about a person would pop into my head and I would investigate further to determine if my original estimate was correct. However after having completed this book this no longer happens. Instead I'm aware that the information came from body language and can follow the full thought through from observation to conclusion rather than letting my subconscious have all the fun.<br /><br />Another interesting trick I picked up from the book is what types of body language can put people at ease. This is very useful for quickly establishing rapport with someone or diffusing conflicts more quickly. More over knowing specific interpretations of body language you can display signs of confidence while avoiding looking aggressive. This means not only do you avoid a conflict, you do so without simply submitting to the other person. I cannot overstate how useful that is to someone like me. When you are a quiet person people assume you lack confidence and will try to walk all over you.<br /><br />That's about all I've got. There are other great reviews here on Amazon that give you a more general idea, I simply wanted to put a different perspective on here for any other quiet observers out there who might be on the fence about this book.
B005HFUQAM|5.0|I knew nothing about Beruit until I heard the song \\"Santa Fe\\" on the radio a few weeks ago.  Such a catchy song I set out to find the album and I'm glad I did.  Every song is great...one of those albums you can listen to from start to end and then just hit repeat and listen to over and over.  A highly-recommended purchase...now I'm off to check out their previous releases!
1451673442|4.0|I have always been a fan of The Secret, and I have always believed in the power of thoughts to create events. I have used \\"Attraction\\" for the past several years and there's no denying the results. The only complaint I had about The Secret was its emphasis on material goods, like getting a sports car or a mansion and that sort of thing. Still, I swear by the principles laid out in that book.<br /><br />The Magic focuses on one of the subjects discussed in The Secret, gratitude, but in greater depth, including simple daily exercises such as remembering to say \\"thank you\\" for the blessings in one's life. However, I do have to say that this book, The Magic, is strikingly similar to a book I liked even more, called \\"The God Academy\\" by Angelica Crystal Powers. The God Academy is supposed to be \\"the advanced class\\" for the concept of Attraction, and that's how I'd describe it. It goes into far greater depth than either The Secret or The Magic.<br /><br />For an introduction to Attraction, you can't do much better than Rhonda Byrne's books. But when you're ready for the seriously advanced stuff, you definitely want to check out The God Academy as well.
B0067LY4WG|5.0|He's done it again!!  Each song/poem completely gets inside one's soul, requiring your undivided attention...and singing once you've learned the lyrics.<br />The man continues on an irresistible course following his years long touring that sets him apart from other performers.  This is a MUST GET!  Thanks, Mr. Cohen, for another treasure you've given us.
B0000DZEE3|5.0|Every Red Hot Chili Pepper fan should have this DVD. Slane Castle was one of the best concerts in the history of history.
1594202710|5.0|This is my first book of Henry Kissinger. I knew all along that Henry Kissinger had a role in US - CHINA relations. But this books shows the depth of his relations with China. For me, this book gave me a good lesson on China's early history. Mao and post Mao era was also captivating. Last two chapters which actually puts in a \\"Policy Statement\\" are very interesting and needs to be read and re-read to understand what may be the exact meaning of all that written in those two chapters. The world is changing and US and China both have great stakes in this world. So where does thing stand at present? Are they as good as shown by Kissinger or there is something else. We should not rule out the possibility that these kind of books are written with a purpose and the purpose could be anything, pushing a new agenda, warning, etc. etc. An excellent work and highly recommended for reading.
B004BLJQOK|4.0|12-year-old Owen [Kodi Smit-McPhee] is a bit of a loner--picked on harshly at school by bullies... often playing by himself in the courtyard where he lives; That is until new neighbors, including Abby (a girl close to his age?) moves in next door. She is mysterious, often walking barefoot in the snow.. even claiming, \\"We can't be friends\\" when she first meets Owen. But, Owen and Abby [perfectly played by up-and-comer Chloe Grace Moretz] do eventually become friends: despite secrets that she has. When he tells her how he's picked on, she tells him to fight back, harder than you've ever thought possible {and if that's not enough, SHE'LL help him. 'But, you're a girl.' he says. \\"I'm alot stronger than you think.\\"}. Owen likes her, and even does so if Abby 'isn't a girl' as she often hints at. Perenially 12 years old, Abby, and Owen do hit it off. While they tackle their own demons.. it is revealed that Abby does what she does, because she is a vampire: but she and Owen form an unlikely friendship.. which is something they both wanted, but neither expected. Fantastic film. Highly recommend the dvd!!
B00563M11M|5.0|Terry Pratchett does it again. In this Discworld novel he touches on many real world issues particularly corruption, politics and racism but as ever it is exceedingly funny. I giggled out loud often and my husband thought I was losing my mind. When he read it he had the same reaction though. If you love Sam Vines and his intrepid wife Lady Sybil you have to read this one!
B005FVFWOI|1.0|I absolutely love Tull and thought their Aqualung 40th Anniversary concert was one of the highlights of my concert career. However, this abomination is a disgrace and can only lead me to conclude that money is all Ian cares about at this stage in his life. The DVD is not a DVD but yet another CD with the same damn songs on the album. Who needs a Blu-ray and a DVD and a CD and an LP with the same stuff on them all? Sorry Ian but if this weren't a gift from my daughter it would be returned in a heartbeat. You're screwing your fans.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|This product was perfect it had no scratches and the shipping was fast too.  This was a great find and I was so excited to watch it.
B006ZB3V2C|5.0|I love this ap!  It's really versatile.  One can add sounds for greater realism, modify the existing combinations, and set a timer.  What more can one ask?
B005VTS4EY|5.0|This is a fun gravity puzzle game. I like the graphics even though they are simple. The levels are pretty easy, but we have easily gotten the price worth of fun out of it on our Kindle Fire.
B0061QD7YS|5.0|My wife wanted this video badly, she loves all of the old movies and we have it on another format which will not be good years from now. So I decided that for her birthday I would get it. The ordering was very easy, good pricing and delivery was on the money. Excellent
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|This is my new favorite weekly show.  It's funny and sexy while full of action.  Alex O'Laughlin is hot! Gotta watch it.
0439023491|5.0|I know that a lot of people said this book was not as good as Hunger Games, but I have to disagree.  Because the concept is so unique, I can understand why the novelty might have worn off with this second book, but really - it is a great read, fast paced - cannot put down - just overall fantastic entertainment.  If you loved the first, you will love this too.  The book starts off months after the first book left off, and picks up with the ongoing adventures of Katniss and her friends - and is fun all the way to the end.  Because I am a PRIME member, I just borrowed the third book (Mockingjay) and plan to start reading it today.
B00077F948|5.0|If you like classical guitar this is an outstanding CD. The variation of pieces is delightful. John Williams is super. Great listening.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|it would be perfect, but when you cook the same meal, it takes up multiple counterspace. if you cook the same thing, it should go to the same counter.

B005K17RU0|1.0|App frequently crashes.  Weather is not updated regularly so it is often wrong.  The switch to daylight savings time confused it.  I deleted this app and installed the Weather Channel app, which seems to be a lot smoother and more accurate.
B004A8ZWT2|5.0|Beautifully staged and photographed, deftly acted and directed, \\"The Tourist\\" will hold it's sparkle through the decades. The musical score is such a delightful enhancement to this film that I purchased it separately to enjoy at me leisure.  Witty, romantic, and just suspenseful enough, this lush film is one of my new favourites.  Enjoy!
B005OYKI1I|5.0|good movie.worth every penny.lots of action with the whole crew of every fast and the furious.must see.quick and fast shipping,plus shipped nicely.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I was so excited to get my cover for my Kindle Fire, that I also just purchased.  The cover is very strong and durable. It has a great style and the red is fabulous!  I took it to Mexico and it is just as new looking as when I first recieved it.  Great designer look to it!<br />Ms.Painterman.
B001OSIV62|5.0|This is normally not something I would be interested in watching, but something compelled me to give it a try. I have to say this was an absolutely amazing documentary. You want to say this guy is crazy, and wasting his time, but I found myself understanding his motivations, and rooting for him. The passion and determination this guy had in 1974, and obviously still has today, is nothing less than inspiring. This reminds me of a famous quote: \\"If a man hasn't discovered something that he will die for, he isn't fit to live.\\" Dr. Martin Luther King, JR. Petit epitomizes that thinking. Give this film a try, you will be glad you did.
B004LP3AYI|1.0|I have read the previous hard and soft copy reprinting(s) but have never been so embarassed for a publisher as during my time reading the kindle version of this novel.  Nearly every page contains errors such as duplicate words (as as, to to, etc.) as well as errors such as I instead of it, or you instead of your.  The proof reader should be shot (or at least look for a different line of work).
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|5 stars is not enough to say how wonderful this series is.  I started it Monday and finished all 3 by Sunday.  Would have been faster if I did not have a job!
1419702203|5.0|George was known as the quiet one but there was a whole lot more to him than any of the other Beatles. It must have been  very difficult being a song writer in a band with two of the worlds greatest but after the release of George's first solo album we all took notice of this youngest member.  His search for inner peace was his life long desire.  He wasn't just a mop head. This book shows us how deep a thinker George was and how kind and generous to his friends and family. The pictures are superb and Olivia's love for her husband shines through. This book is a keeper for any Beatle fan.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a good book and a good series, The Hunger Games.  On a Kindle the book is easy to read.  I recommend it to other readers

0307408833|2.0|I received this book as a gift. I would not have bought it myself. I wanted to give it one star out of spite, but that would be unfair - if you follow the recipes, you will end up with good stuff, which is the most important metric for measuring the success of a cookbook. The plot thickens, however, and the short review is that I was disappointed. Here's the long review:<br /><br />In buying this book, you will get exactly what you pay for, which is the style manual for the most chic, upscale hipster bakery New York has to offer. I've decided that this book is not so much a bakery cookbook as a lifestyle statement from hers truly, Erin McKenna. She must feel she has been the object of much fawning over, from the authoritative and at times pretentious tone she takes throughout the book.<br /><br />I found myself shaking my head at her ingredient selection, which includes<br /><br />-Bob's Red Mill flour: inexplicable and unforgivable! Are you serious? This is equivalent to asking for Bisquick in your baking cookbook. The biggest challenge of gluten-free baking revolves around your flour blend; relying on a premade (and might I add gross-tasting) flour blend is a high-magnitude cop-out.<br /><br />-Agave nectar: a pretty passé ingredient that blew through the collective health-consciousness as quickly as it appeared. This comes off as more of a lifestyle marketing stunt than any real effort to be health-conscious, and to some degree it dates this book embarrassingly.<br /><br />-Coconut oil: fair enough, McKenna, but as any home baker comes to realize, this stuff is expensive and not always indicated. Olive oil or butter (if, like many, you are GF but not vegan) will often suffice.<br /><br />I'm no expert, and I certainly don't own the IP to New York's most successful allergy-friendly bakery, but as a fairly experienced gluten-free baker, I've found many of these recipes to be lackluster. She doesn't seem to have a firm grasp of the fundamentals, leading to relianceon ingredients like Bob's Red Mill. And spelt!<br /><br />You read that right: spelt. It's not gluten-free. It's not gluten-free! Why is it in this book? It alienates a significant percentage of this book's target audience (because, let's face it, it's not any kind of vegan bible). Spelt is the number one cop-out of the gluten-free world - it says, \\"I want to cater to your needs, but it's too hard so I'm meeting you halfway, which only works for a small percentage of you.\\"<br /><br />I've walked away from this book with only bad things to say. This book is, first and foremost, a lesson in successful marketing. It's full of artsy pictures of hipster girls looking oh-so-cute in their baking getups. There are some helpful ideas in here, and any gluten-free baker could stand to learn something from this book. But it's a poor substitute for a comprehensive bake book, and lord knows gluten-free folks are sick of poor substitutes.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Great video of Great Theatre!!!! I totally recommend this excellent product for the promotion of an outstanding cultural event and theatrical production. It is a great purchase and a most worthwhile cultural amd artistic investment.
B004132HZS|5.0|Brilliant! Best Sherlock Holmes of the 21st century, a must see! Only 3 episodes, but they are an hour and a half long, so almost like watching a movie. Can't wait for season 2.
B000JQU1VS|4.0|What can you say, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is the definative writer of Sherlock Holmes stories.  Many have copied him but few come close to the master.  And now its free on the Kindle..
B0066W1AZK|1.0|every time I got trapped or it was a draw... IT FROZE! It wouldn't let me move or say that I gave up. Bottom line. is DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!
B005VTS4EY|5.0|Love it. Easy to lean but leaves you thinking and experimenting. Great physics fame for kids. And no annoying music.
B000JQUMPI|3.0|I selected this price due to its price (free) and remembering reading it as a child. I read about a third and realized it was too idealistic for my adult tastes, and stopped.
B005FVNJTS|5.0|An excellent read.  Great to see how someone can overcome physical setbacks to achieve greatness in the sporting world.  This book was written from the heart.  Rafa will be my hero forever.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|Haven't used this, but it is important on my PC. I use it more on the PC than the Kindle.

B000Q67876|5.0|it's amazing .. you must happy to this edition. Must buy Digibook. Because tranfer picture very AMAZING ! full LCD too .. Great Movie .. Great Digibook .. what else .. buy it if prices right ..
B006UG90RM|5.0|As a diehard VH/DLR fan, of course I was ready to welcome the new album with open arms.  What I wasn't ready for was the rock-n-roll punch that left my husband and me slack-jawed!  There's a reason why the album cover is a locomotive crashing through the cover.  Since then, I have listened to the album countless times and am convinced that it might just be their best album EVER!  What has two thumbs and grins from ear to ear?  This VH fan :)
B001JNNE64|3.0|it's good for digibook .. but very bad for picture. Transfer picture like DVD .. so sad nice packaging but bad picture. i buy it because it's cheap and also includes CD .. it's fair to me. if u dont have this edition .. thinking twice ..
B005DOKIYG|4.0|Was quite happy with it. Would actually like to find one for my touch device. Seems to keep it protected and allows for easy access.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is more than just a book. It is a poem of life,death,love,hate,and happyness. A dramatic, well written captavating story.Thank you for making this book.When a person opens this book a hunger will begin in them…a hunger to read! All three books. LET THE HUNGER GAMES BEGIN!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Works good for me in Bible college. looking forward to use this much more each day. God bless the creators
B0001K2K84|3.0|Some good funky playing on here, but also some totally throwaway silliness like \\"Space Lady\\" ruins the flow. To me, this sort of fusion jazz sounds a bit dated 30 years after the fact. But hey, it was the 70s so you had to have drum solos and all that stuff. The musicianship is top notch, as fans of Duke and Cobham would expect, but overall I think the material on this album is not their strongest.
B0062NAX1U|2.0|Its funny how most of the reviews (and I have read a large portion of them) are not really a critique of the movie itself but about how one feels about Christianity.  Most non-believers gave the movie a low rating simply because it was a Christian film, while the professing Christians gave it a high rating merely because it is Christian.  I have been a sold out disciple of Christ Jesus for 21 years and in all honesty this was NOT a great movie, decent, but not great.  The message was clear and timely, but the mediocore acting, poor character development, unrealistic plot points (there were a few), and general oversimplifications makes it less than exemplary entertainment.  I understand that a world that is at emnity with God makes it challenging to produce quality Christian entertainment, but for believers to give every Christian endeavor a thumbs up is disingenuous; it makes others question the validity of other matters, including those of faith.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Not being a great gamer I enjoy this app for the ease &amp; variety. Nice  break from Angry Birds. great for kids...
B0036T32LQ|5.0|One of the better movies I've seen recently, hence the allusion to The Prestige.<br /><br />Well.  That, and it shares some commonalities with it, as well, aside from being a great movie.  I'll admit that about 30 minutes in I already knew basically what was going to happen--but there were still enough twists and turns to keep me surprised at the moment-to-moment events, and each time I thought I'd figured out exactly how it worked, there was something more around the corner.  Combined with the way little things from earlier in the movie kept coming back, it kept me going \\"Oh... ohhh, that's why...\\" right up to the end.  Other reviewers have noted that the first few minutes are really confusing--they really should be, because suddenly understanding why it all made sense is what delivers the impact at the end.<br /><br />On a level, the characters' lack of genre-savviness was aggravating in places, but I can forgive them considering the circumstances; and that not everyone's a scifi nerd.  Avoiding spoilers, if you like stories where the plot seems scattered and incomprehensible at times, but you get to watch all the dots connect as you go and by the end it's all come together (e.g., The Time Traveler's Wife and a lot of Dr. Who episodes by Moffat, especially \\"Big Bang\\") you'll probably love Triangle.<br /><br />If there's a problem, it's that I'm left wondering what happens from the outside world's perspective, since the story almost exclusively follows one character's point of view.  I can theorize, and one interpretation is certainly implied near the end, but a little more would have been nice, considering how surreal it gets in places...<br /><br />Altogether, though, it was fantastic, and well worth seeing, at least for those who aren't too squeamish.
B002ZNJW0O|5.0|I was very satisfied with this book. It was in great condition. I loved reading it too!  I will definitely purchase more items from amazon in the future.
B00493E1GI|1.0|I can't find the words to describe how repulsive this movie is.  It is merely one lustful scene after another.  I've tried several times to make it past the first 10 minutes without success.  I've skipped around in the movie trying to detect a reason why Julia Roberts would waste her time and mine with such trash.  I have many of her movies and most are good to great.<br /><br />The only thing I can think of is that perhaps she was a bit restless in her own romantic affairs.  It is clear to me why Garry Marshall declined to be the director.  He is a wise person.<br /><br />At least it had one positive effect if I understand correctly.  I read that she found and converted to Hinduism while filming this movie and I think that is a profound benefit for her.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Downloaded this game to my Kindel Fire and I love this game.Great way to pass some time when you don't want to get to involved.

1589946006|5.0|What more can you say? A bag of unnameable indescribable horrors aka resin statues of Cthulhu. They're great but have absolutely no educational value. I love 'em, and scatter them on my desk whenever my senior directors come wandering by muttering about a clear desk policy. Perfect for that.
B00003CXRM|4.0|Thanks for the video.  We had loaned out ours and never got it back.  This is a great movie. Fast response.  Again, thank you!
B000PMLFRA|2.0|I am a person who doesn't have a gigantic wall of hundreds of DVD and Blu-Ray discs simply because there isn't enough time in the world to watch all those over and over again, and I have better uses for my money such as funding a 401k.  That being said, I do spend some of my money on movies that I have as favorites.  I have cinematic masterpieces that I will want to enjoy with my home theater, and then some hokey favorites of mine that I love to view just as much (Citizen Kane on one hand, Uncle Buck on the other).<br /><br />I already own the widescreen THX DVD copies of the original Star Wars trilogy that was re-released in theaters with the Lucas CGI updates.  I can tolerate *some* of the changes that George made to the films to punch up a few things that just weren't up to snuff in the late 70s and early 80s, but other things I don't like.  These are films I like to watch at least 2 or three times a year so I want to make sure I enjoy them as they are presented.  I rented the new Blu-Ray versions from the video store prior to purchase.<br /><br />All I can say . . what a disappointment.<br /><br />George Lucas has taken the original trilogy and pumped up the color saturation to the point where they are bright, glowing cartoon versions of their original negatives IN SOME SCENES.  It's as if George went back to his Episode III films and then wanted to turn the original trilogy into nothing more than eye candy for the modern generation of film viewers.<br /><br />I won't be one of the Star Wars purists that insists my childhood has been ruined with the new alterations to these movies, but I will say it's simply not what I remember and not what I want in a film.
1576754227|5.0|Do you find yourself procrastinating? You know what I mean; when you begin finding excuses for not getting things done. Brian Tracy has written a quick and easy to read book called Eat That Frog!: 21 Great Ways to Stop Procrastinating and Get More Done in Less Time. It is a time management must read!<br /><br />The subtitle says it all: 21 Great Ways to Stop Procrastinating and Get More Done in Less Time. Personally and professionally, I'm all for getting more done in less time. In fact, this book is written so that you can read it quickly and immediately begin using the suggestions. First published in 2001 Eat That Frog! is still relevant today, even in this fast-paced digital age.<br /><br />As the author states, \\"Your `frog' is your biggest, most important task, the one you are most likely to procrastinate on if you don't do something about it now. It is also the one task that can have the greatest impact on your life and results at the moment.\\"<br /><br />So, how do you eat that frog? You eat your frog one bite-sized piece at a time - one task at a time. Each of the \\"21 Great Ways\\" is a chapter. Each chapter is short, sweet to the point and provides practical insight into staying on task. At the end of each chapter, there are positive \\"Eat That Frog\\" follow-up activities.<br /><br />No matter where you are currently in your life and career, there is a lesson or two you will come away with by reading this book. We all strive for greater productively with less stress - Brian Tracy gives us some great and practical suggestions for doing just that.<br /><br />I highly recommend Eat That Frog! by Brian Tracy.

1451683405|1.0|I'm a Sam Harris fan - loved \\"The End of Faith\\".  But this essay is so trite and silly to warrant relatively little critique (it doesn't rise to a bar to warrant more).  The premise is obvious and pointless, the writing repetitive (it's a basic point - not deep or hard to grok - and he makes it over and over and over) and even at that the premise is unsupported by either evidence or logic in his presentation.  At the end of the day this essay is pure garbage in that he twists the concept of free will by locking on to an uncontroversial semantics angle.  So, yeah, if you want to define free will as requiring that the laws of physics don't apply and that we mustn't be impacted by our previous experiences, then, sure, we don't have free will.  But who defines free will that way?  Just as no one would say you don't have free will because you can't breathe under water if that's what you want to do, no one begins with Harris' premise.  Wish I hadn't wasted money on this tedious, pointless essay.
B000IEXVCC|4.0|Excellent, twists ones mind, leaves no space between fantasy and reality, both become one. Fantastic imagery, if Salvador Dali were a \\"movie maker\\", this would be his film.<br />I oftened wondered did others have the same \\"issues\\" of dreams intertwining with waking, obviously David Lynch is one of those who does.<br />When we remember events, people and the things we've done, are we remebering dreams or \\"reality\\", is there a difference, is closing our eyes the boundary or the door ?<br />This David Lynch is definitly of the same ilk as Luis Bunuel, Frederico Fellini et al.<br />Laura Harrings immersion and transformation into her role is truly unique, a Tour De Force performance.<br />Naomi Watts again, as she has done many times proves herself to be in the elite.<br />i need to watch this again, and then again.

B0072GPPNC|5.0|Just as Spielberg released both Jurassic Park and Schindler's List in the year of our lord, 1993, so too has he released The Adventures of Tintin and War Horse within a few weeks of each other in 2011.  To quote another film, perhaps he is \\"trying to suggest something about the duality of man,\\" and that man is Spielberg himself.  War Horse is destined to become an essential entry into Spielberg's oeuvre, a sumptuous piece of filmmaking that forms part of a conversation between Spielberg and the epics from Hollywood's golden age.  If the film has a central protagonist, then it is Joey, the stallion who makes his way from pastoral England to the war torn continent.  As the film begins, Ted Narracott, a well meaning drunkard, is searching for a suitable horse to plow an arid but rock filled plot of land.  He travels into town with the intention of bidding on a solid work horse, but a little too much drink and a betting match between Ted and his seedy landlord leads him to buy a young stallion, a horse that, as his friends note, is completely unsuitable for the grueling work of plowing a field.<br /><br /> When Ted returns home to his wife, she, quite understandably, becomes upset and tells her husband he will have to return the horse immediately.  Ted's son, Albert, becomes taken with the horse and convinces his parents that he will be able to train the horse to take a harness and pull a plow.  As Albert trains his horse, Joey, the two of them form a bond.  Spielberg gets plenty of drama out of the nearly wordless communication necessary to teach Joey to eat out of a bucket, to stay or come on command, or to remain still as Albert fits a harness over his head.  Of course, Spielberg has a distinct knack for communicating sans words.  My guess is that if one were to watch War Horse with the sound off, it wouldn't take much to follow the ups and downs of the story.  Albert does manage to get Joey to plow the once useless plot, if only after the ground has been softened bythe English rain.  But this doesn't end the hardships of the Narracotts.  Shortly after planting their crops, a thunderstorm upends their crops, and Ted must find some way to make the rent.  World War I has just broken out, and he decides to lease Joey to the English army.  Joey will be returned, if he survives.<br /><br /> From here, Joey makes his way from owner to owner, crisscrossing a war ravaged Europe.  He begins in the care of an English officer, but ends up in the hands of two underage German brothers, a young French girl and her grandfather, and a German caretaker.  For a film that borrows so heavily from traditional Hollywood cinema, War Horse has a plenty of experimental elements.  And while Joey serves as a constant, each new set of characters he encounters function as a kind of vignette, as if Spielberg had connected several short films into a full length.  These vignettes allow the film to get away from the protagonist versus antagonist narrative found in most war films.  Because Joey traverses borders, our sympathies lie not with nation-states, the English versus the Germans, but with individual characters.  If there is a villain in the film, then it is the war itself.  This structure seems especially suited to WWI, perhaps one of the most singularly idiotic wars ever waged.<br /><br /> Spielberg is borrowing heavily from the epics of the mid-twentieth century.  There's plenty of John Ford, Akira Kurosawa, Mikhail Kalatozishvili, David Lean, and early Stanley Kubrick in the DNA of War Horse.  He takes from these artists a painter's sense of how to fill up a canvas.  Here Spielberg is painting every little corner of the screen, to the extent where seeing the film in your living room is a completely different experience from viewing the film on the big screen.  Perhaps one of the most interesting choices in the film is the decision to obscure most of the violence when portraying one of the world's goriest wars.  This is an especially intriguing decision when you consider that Spielberg taught an entire generation how to recreate military violence in Saving Private Ryan.  And yet, just as many people were enraptured by Ryan's violence as were repulsed.  One particular scene in War Horse is arguably a more effective representation of violence than all of Ryan's gobs of blood.  In what is most likely a scene influenced by Sergei Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin, Spielberg cuts back and forth between images of English cavalry charging, German machine guns firing, and a slew of riderless horses.  The audience can easily fill in what occurs between each cut, perhaps more effectively than any filmmaker could.<br /><br /> In War Horse we have a perfect coalition between Spielberg the craftsman and Spielberg the student of film.  Watching War Horse it becomes evident why the 1970s were the golden years of American cinema.  These directors were formally trained in film school where they were introduced to criticism that dissected the classics.  These directors didn't watch movies; they studied them.  And yet the movie isn't just fodder for film buffs to pick apart.  Any casual fan of Spielberg's work will find plenty of affecting moments in War Horse.  I saw the film over the holidays with my family, and at the conclusion of the movie, my mother turned to me and, rebuffing common assumptions, said, \\"He made it like they used to.\\"  She's absolutely right, in a way.  This is a film that looks to the past for inspiration, but at the same time it cannot be mistaken for the work of anyone other than Spielberg himself.
B006ZCWTZG|5.0|All of Bruce Springsteen's releases are incredible, but Wrecking Ball is his best in 30 years. To me, it's the new Born in the USA. Not in terms of popularity and catchy pop songs, but in message.<br /><br />BUSA was an album reflecting the slice of life and turmoil America was experiencing in the aftermath of the Vietnam War and the depression of the 70's. Wrecking Ball is that message for our current hard times.<br /><br />Each song is a call to action, a bugle call lead by the Irish fighting song, \\"Death to My Hometown\\", but then again, each song can lead the charge to take back our country, our way of life and our lives. Bruce is telling us and the powers-that-be that we're Americans and we can overcome any adversity and give it back to the oppressors in the form of our own Wrecking Ball backed with the power of American determination, dedication and anger.<br /><br />Thanks Bruce. We needed you to lead the charge.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|The film reminded me of the voices that never told their stories about the 60's.  Although, the film is based on fiction, it gives a vivid picture of the interactions between women of race during that time period.  The film expresses some of the sentiment that existed in that time.  However, it was not acceptable for many women to voice their opinions during that time.  It truly captured the similar experiences of all women in relationships and a society dominated by men.

B0047Y17P2|5.0|My kindle discovered the Michael Connelly and the Lincoln Lawyer a year and a half ago.  Since then I've gone through all the Lincoln Lawyer books and all the Harry Bosch books.  All are fast paced, tense, and realistic.  Give me more!
1451683405|2.0|I must disappoint at least one reader: the free will issue is far too complex to be described in a 'crystal clear' way in just 80 pages. It is a problem with a long tradition and one which is far from easy to address. Anyone who wants to understand the matter will have to read considerably more than this.<br /><br />For neuroscientists, the free will issue is one of mechanisms; for philosophers it is a matter of concepts. Harris falls into that narrow crevasse between the philosophical side of the debate and the neuroscientific side of the debate. This is already obvious on page four: having described a dreadful crime, Harris makes the point about the criminals that 'were I to trade places with one of these men, atom for atom, I would BE him.' Well, of course you would, Mr Harris! Most philosophers have long since abandoned the idea that 'Sam Harris' is a ghost who happens to reside in the body of Sam Harris. Sam Harris is Sam Harris, that's it, in a materialist world. There is no ghost in-the machine. But what has that to do with the issue of free will? It doesn't follow from the fact that Sam Harris is a material entity that Sam Harris does not have the possibility of making choices.<br /><br />Numerous errors follow from his basic misconception of what personal identity might be. It is certainly true, for instance that 'I cannot take credit for the fact that I do not have the soul of a psychopath'. On the other hand, even psychopaths can choose: the fear of being caught keeps most psychopaths within reasonable bounds most of the time, as psychotherapists tell us. Very few psychopaths end up in jail. Instead, They look at the circumstances and make their decision 'wisely'. YOU might decide that to kill someone would be to do something morally awful and therefore not to do it. That's your set of rules. The psychopath might decide that to kill someone might be fun, but not worth the bother of 30 years in prison. That's his set of rules. That is why they have to be severely punished when they take evil decisions - it deters them. The fact that they do not offend all the time shows us that they can make choices.<br /><br />Nor is it true that we have no control over our thoughts, as Harris claims. I can sit down in my philosophical armchair right now, call up a whole list of themes to think about such as a) my last holiday, b) my next holiday or c) the book I am currently reading etc. I can decide to put aside a) and b) and focus on c) for the three hours or so. (If you doubt that, then try it). Sure that impulse is coming from the totality of my physical being - but to point that out is question begging. Where else is it supposed to come from?<br /><br />Furthermore, it is indeed difficult to change bad habits such as smoking. But: IT CAN BE DONE! Lot's of people have done so. This only proves that we are not as free as we pretend to be, but we do ultimately seem to have the long term possiblity of at least mild changes of course. Clearly some are better at it than others but that is a psychological issue (motivations, mechanisms, success rates) not a philosophical, i.e. a conceptual issue. We are a bundle of impulses and desires, to be sure - but it doesn't follow that we cannot make choices.<br /><br />Harris makes much of his friendship with Daniel Dennett - but maybe he should listen to his friend rather more closely? Dennett is one of the deepest thinkers on the issue of free will today, and has developed his own (very restricted) idea of what free will might be. He addresses and deals with all of the points raised by Harris and has addressed most of them decades ago. There is no new argument here.<br /><br />In summary: Harris simply makes his unoriginal point over and over again, which makes even this notably short book too long. He is haranguing or browbeating us, rather than discussing with us. He claims to give us  facts but what he actually gives us is his aggessivly expressed personal opinion. Most of his examples are from violent crime, an interesting point in itself. But what he essentially has to say is said in the first six pages.<br /><br />It is hard to know for whom this book is written: the informed reader will shake his or her head and be surprised at the naivety of the argumentation. The uninformed reader is likely to think that philosophers are still pursuing the 'ghost-in-the-machine' concept which was denigrated by Gilbert Ryle a whole generation ago (Dennett was one of his students). The book gets two stars for effort: to give it more would be an injustice to those who have thought considerably harder about the difficult matter of free will.

1612130283|1.0|If there was any way possible to give a negative 5 star rating, that is what I would give this book.  I want to sue the author and the publisher to get those 3 hours of my life back.  There are no words to describe how absolutely horrible this book is.<br /><br />I purchased the Kindle version of \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" after seeing a segment on \\"Today\\" with four women raving about how great it was.  It is the biggest disappointment of any literary purchase I've ever made.  It is fictional, of course.  I was going to stop reading it at about the 20% mark, but I thought maybe I should give it a chance and it might get better.  At almost 50% completion, it is still NOT better.  It reads as though it is written by an 18-yr old virgin and edited by a 12-year old.  A much better choice for this type of fictional material and subject is The Sleeping Beauty series by Anne Rice, writing as A. N. Roquelaure.<br /><br />I have no idea why this book is receiving great reviews - it is absolutely horrible.  The characters are annoying & ridiculous.  I thought I would self combust if I had to read the biting lip comment one more time. I would rather have a root canal than read another book from this trilogy.

B004QSYSZ0|5.0|We were thrilled that we could add a few wooden Chuggington pieces to our large \\"Island of Sodor.\\"<br />In addition to purchasing numerous Wooden Chuggers, we chose this Double Decker Roundhouse to be the hub for our addition of Chuggington city.<br /><br />A few things to note:<br /><br />Compatibility:<br />This is fully compatible with all Thomas wooden pieces (meaning they connect together). The wooden tracks are slightly different (aesthetically, which most likely isn't a big deal) but the main difference is they don't have the anti slip texture in the wheel slot (which Thomas tracks have to give traction for the battery operated trains). Both Thomas and Chuggington wooden trains have the same wheel base (width) and they are also made by the same company Learning Curve, so they work universally on the tracks. The biggest thing to note is if you have a lot of Thomas destinations, the Chuggington trains are taller and do not fit under many Thomas bridges and tunnels (some Thomas destinations offer more height room, so it depends on your layout).<br /><br />Wish I could have known this at time of purchase:<br />MOST IMPORTANT THING to note on compatibility is the height of the risers (Thomas vs Chuggington) are not the same. Since this roundhouse allows trains to drive on top of the building, naturally you want to descend ramps from both sides to connect to a layout, but Thomas risers are not tall enough. I HIGHLY recommend picking up the Chuggington [[ASIN:B004QSZ4V2 Elevated Track Pack]] where you get 4 ramps and you will need 4 (2 for each side) and 6 risers (you really only need 2). If you want to purchase even more risers and ramps to build roller coaster hills, I recommend [[ASIN:B00009ILZ5 Learning Curve Thomas and Friends Wooden Railway - Stacking Risers (3 Pieces)]] or [[ASIN:B000062SPW Thomas And Friends Wooden Railway - Up And Away Expansion Pack]] since they are more sturdy- but if you purchase this building definitely pick up ONE Chuggington pack- soyou can complete your track!<br /><br />Functionality:<br />This Double Decker Roundhouse works beautifully- just as advertised. The turntable spins easily and the pop-up button works flawlessly. It is also easy for small hands to reset and push it back down. There are 6 bays, which are generously sized for the taller Chugginton trains, which means all of your other Thomas trains can drive in too!<br />I don't know if ours was missing instructions or if they just don't come with any, but it took me some time to figure out how to get the turntable flush with the roundhouse. The trick is that a piece of the gray border plastic can be snapped (lifted off) to allow it to slide under the roundhouse and attach. It will make more sense if you have this in front of you (lift off one section to slide under a double-decker, or lift off BOTH to slide under a circular roundhouse.)<br /><br />I am really glad this gives our little engineer freedom to change the building configuration, AND really glad that this is the first roundhouse that you can drive on- most roundhouses are for parking only- and take up a lot of space in your layout- love that this is PART of our track course!<br /><br />Bottom line: Whether you have a Chuggington fan, Thomas fan, or BOTH in your house- your little engineer is sure to love this- just don't forget to pickup the ramps + risers (Chuggington Elevated Pack)!!

B007BLCGNU|5.0|Clint Eastwood did an excellent job with this film.  The sets, clothes and artistic detail were spot on. The actors did an absolutely phenomenal job. Especially Leonardo DiCaprio in what could have come off as a bad caricature of a very complex, driven, intelligent and ultimately flawed character in our history.  This is definitely not a movie for those with an attention span most Hollywoood movies go for however.  You need to be interested and give yourself over to enjoying this gradually built and wonderfully executed story.

B002KSPKRS|4.0|Turtle Beach delivers an excellent gaming experience with the Ear Force x41 digital wireless headphones. I took off a single star for a few cons to be discussed, but, overall, the package lives up to expectations. Though these headphones obviously won't blow away audiophiles, they offer enough clarity and separation to hear the entire range of action, from BGM to voice. It also offers a decent 10m range, so it works perfect in a basic entertainment setup. The base also sends the digitally processed signal through the analog out, a nice bonus.<br /><br />There are a few \\"however\\"s to point out.<br /><br />The sound is fairly plush, but it is weak on highs and lows. The headphones won't blow anybody away with bass, and the highs are easily distorted. The 10m range also means you might have to play around with your setup. Mine is fine for now, but I'll have to move things around to position the base just right. If you get beyond the 'happy' communication range, you will notice some nasty hissing and pops. If something interrupts the signal, you will notice hissing and pops. Also important to note, batteries pay a huge roll in maintaining quality of audio reception. If you use poor/low-quality batteries or allow the batteries to run low, the frequency of the hiss and occurrence of pops increases.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is the included optical cable. It is cheap, far too flexible, and about as thin as uncooked spaghetti. You will want to buy a better quality optical cable. You want an optical cable with some flexibility, but it needs to be stiff enough to protect the delicate glass tube. If the glass breaks, you can kiss the signal goodbye.<br /><br />Also, audio pass through for the win! Turtle Beach understands that gamers sometimes want to enjoy a game with friends and/or family without disturbing everybody around them. With the pass through, anybody playing along side you gets to enjoy the x41's digital processing without any fuss.

B000FC1MM8|5.0|Michael Connely used to be a crime reporter.  He spent hours upon hours at  police stations--listening, watching, visiting with cops.  The tale of Harry Bosch, Homicide Detective, somehow evolved from that experience.  Harry Bosch is a loner; he carries a lot of baggage; he works for the ones who have no more voice: the murdered.  He is particular about detail; he despises slovenly work.  He resents the politicalization of police work.  Harry Bosch is a quirky fellow.  His personality resembles that of a porcupine on a bad day. Never the less, one can't help but like him.  He cares.  He believes that \\"everybody matters or nobody matters\\".  He latches unto a cold case file like some strange, originally bred mongrel dog--nose like a bloodhound, jaws like a bull-terrier, eyes like an afghan, heart like a german shepherd, work ethic like those unbelievably smart scottish sheep herding dogs, with maybe a touch of wolf or coyote to lend an untameable streak. Nothing boring about Mr. Connelly's protagonist.  Nothing boring about the cases, either.  And absolutely nothing boring about Mr. Connelly's tight, well-crafted journalist's prose.  THE LAST COYOTE is a good read.  Enjoy.<br /><br />No.  I did not mention the plot.  It's a murder mystery.  You have to read it for yourself.<br /><br />I purchased this book (and several others by Michael Connelly) from Amazon.
B005QYKE2Y|5.0|This is another hit!  The Transformers movies are all great movies, full of action and incredible CGI!  This movie is (in my opinion) a must-see.  You won't be disappointed.  Love CGI!

B002DJSBMA|5.0|This movie was fantastic!  The plot was a very good one, one that I had not experienced before.  Brad Pitt was, well, BRAD PITT!  His acting was superb, and so were those of his co-stars-Anthony Hopkins was phenomenal!  This movie will make you tear up, so be prepared!
B005VTS4EY|3.0|its an awesome game,but its impossible to get past certain levels,like level 50,if they can change that than it would be a five star game.(or if you can tell me how to get past level 50)

Of course, the computer graphics were top-notch!  I would recommend this movie.  It was fun, warming, and attention-grabbing throughout the entirety of the movie.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|This book was so compelling that I went and bought my first apple computer having been a PC user for decades. It is hard to imagine had Steve Jobs read the book he would have been totally pleased which makes it that much more interesting to read. When I was in the apple store his presence could be felt..at times I felt he was controlling from the grave. For anyone who uses a computer this book would be a fantastic read.

B00797MB0O|3.0|All it seems to take are a few moody days musing about what could have happened if you'd only picked door number 2 -- twenty years ago. As the Gatsby character in Diablo Cody's Young Adult, Theron has come to small town nowhere to spend a few days pouring bourbon into her resolution to pluck her Daisy from his domestic clutches. The tentacles are extra sticky, them being attached to the grab bag that is a mother's and a baby's hold upon their man. Staples of the melodrama, such as self-reflective pathos played out in front of mirrors endues and ennuis in equal pleasure.
B006HGXGWU|1.0|I admit it--I was suckered by the excellent trailor into wasting two hours of my precious time, but the movie itself was so boring that my family left me to finish watching it after an hour.  Unfortunately, I stuck it out until the end.  There is nothing--I repeat nothing, worth seeing in this movie. Good acting by everyone, but the movie stinks.<br /><br />Spoiler:  For those of you hoping for a huge storm complete with all of the Hollywood special effects--it never comes.  It's suggested just before they roll the end credits which leaves room for a Take Shelter II.  Can you blame them?  They know there's a sucker born every day.

0307352145|5.0|While the topic of introversion and extroversion has spawned countless books and articles, \\"Quiet\\" takes a fresh look while still providing a good introduction for the uninitiated. As someone who has been reading about Introversion and the underlying psychology for decades, I was happy to find new material, based on new research. The author brings together several lines of research about the genetic and biological underpinnings of introversion. She also sites several new-to-me behavioral studies to show how far introverts can go to fit into a world built on extrovert standards, and how they (we) can succeed at it. (Hint: go outside your comfort zone for things you really care about.) The author ends with advice to introverts and those who manage them, care about them, or live with them. The writing is crisp and accessible and the book is a quick read.<br /><br />The only downside of the book is some minor whining in the first chapter about life as an introvert in an extrovert-ideal world; the last thing we need is another victim class. But this foray is short-lived so push on to get to the beneficial presentation and summaries of research.

B006UG90RM|5.0|I will admit that when first heard Tattoo I was extremely disappointed.  Additionally, I had seen videos from the previous tour and Eddie was horrible in many cases (out of tune, bad timing, etc).  That being said,  I listened to the samples of this album and it still did not do anything for me.  But then my brother let me borrow his copy and as I listened to the album in it's entirety it began to grow on me.  I have found that the more I listen it to it seems to get better each time.  It is pure Eddie Van Halen with a heavier sound and Wolfgang is simply a younger version of Eddie on the bass!!!  Dave is the same as always and Alex still holds his own.  I had a similar experience when 5150 was released where the sound was not appealing and it grew on me after time. However, this album simply contains the original sound with nothing to remind you of the Sammy years.  Nothing against Sammy because I truly enjoyed their music/time together, but in a nutshell THEY'RE BACK!!!  STAY FROSTY!!!
0374275637|5.0|In this book, the author explores intuition and rational thinking, in particular focusing on both the strengths and flaws of intuition. The author does a good job of presenting his research and reinforcing it with case studies. He makes it easy to understand the concepts. What I found most fascinating was how much we take for granted intuition in terms of what it tells even though it can be wrong. We don't really question that and he explains why we don't question it. This is a great book to read if you are interested in psychology or social behavior.

B004LROUNG|1.0|Grisholm has lost his ability to pen a strong legal thriller. This book is not based even remotely in reality--the story is too contrived to be believed and is not written to hold one's interest. Grisholm needs to take more time with writing a first-rate novel rather than just writing to get it published and receive the royalties.
0062082353|5.0|my husband wanted this book so I ordered it on amazon..it came on time...he liked it but not as great as he had hoped...
B000WDROYK|5.0|I am upset that people take times out of their days to trash art. This movie has some nudity and sexual content in it. Does this hurt the beauty of the film? NO Way! Some movies have nudity and sex for no reason at all, this movie Must have it to work. We are only talking about seconds here folks. If you do not watch this movie because of reviews that say it's too erotic , sexual ect. You re going to miss one of the best Holocaust  love stories ever told.  I promise you that the negative reviews based nudity, sex,are way overblown, and the story is one you will never forget. The movie isn't for children,but if you are a mature adult with common sence you WILL love this film.Nuff said

B0067EKY7M|3.0|Fred Jones (Ewan McGregor) is a scientist who specializes in fish. When he's contacted by Harriet Chetwode-Talbot (Emily Blunt) about her boss Sheikh Muhammad (Amr Waked) wanting to bring salmon to the Yemen, Fred scoffs at the project and flat out turns them down. Through some convincing and with his job on the line, Fred eventually agrees to try to bring salmon to the Yemen. Despite the uphill battle, Fred discovers that Sheikh isn't quite as crazy as he imagined and Fred begins to look at Harriet as more than just a fellow colleague.<br /><br />Many may view Salmon Fishing in the Yemen as a witty comedy; at least as far as the first half is concerned. To be honest though, it generally irritated me for a good forty five minutes or so. Nearly everyone on-screen came off as a bunch of annoying twits, especially Ewan McGregor and Kristin Scott Thomas. The comedy wasn't funny either. It was like a string of snarky remarks that were nothing more than obnoxious. Emily Blunt is the only character who really had charm and likeability. Blunt is basically the only person that feels human. Being forced to listen to stuffy and uptight people drone on and on isn't my idea of entertainment or comedy. Did anyone reading this watch \\"Scrubs\\"? You know how Dr. Cox's (John C. McGinley) rants were funny in small doses, but got on your last nerve if there were too many of them in one episode or if they went on for too long? The feeling is similar to how Salmon Fishing in the Yemen will affect you.<br /><br />Once the Sheik is introduced though, it's as if that unlikeable layer is washed away. All of the snooty characters loosen up a bit and pull the stick out of their rear end. Suddenly a man who was looked at as being out of his mind is the only one speaking logically. Fred begins to warm up to the idea of bringing salmon fishing to an area that seems unlikely. The flaws he makes and the triangle that develops between him, Harriet, and her boyfriend Robert (Tom Mison) are essentially the heart of the film. The salmon fishing becomes secondary.<br /><br />What's interesting is the first half of the film can be looked at as a straight comedy (this can be debated for some) and the second half is more of this dramatic romantic comedy. Some of the best dialogue of the film happens when Fred and Harriet show up in the Yemen after Sheik has started bringing water to the middle of the desert. They pass a group of people praying and Fred says, \\"I don't think I know anyone who goes to church.\\" Harriet replies, \\"Me neither.\\" Fred pauses before saying, \\"On Sunday, we go to Target.\\" The humor is pretty dry throughout the film, but feels like it doesn't really hit its mark until the second half.<br /><br />Salmon Fishing in the Yemen wasn't the best movie to sit through. A good portion of the film got under my skin, but then it got a bit easier to tolerate before actually becoming halfway decent. The film features some beautiful cinematography with incredibly green scenery and this amazing perspective in the water almost as if you're seeing through the eyes of a fish. Once the majority of the characters stop being such uptight douchebags, they're actually very warm in an almost enchanting sense. Salmon Fishing in the Yemen actually has a pretty powerful message at its core and a philosophy that just about everyone could learn from.the heart of the film.

B004LROUNG|3.0|I read many good reviews of this book before deciding to buy it on my kindle and was severely disappointed. I found it uninteresting and anti-climactic. Definitely not one of Grisham's best works.
B003Y5H574|5.0|Movie was fabulous! Great cast, great storyline, romantic, warm and hilariously funny! Loved every minute of it, 10 out 10, however quality of DVD was terrible !!<br />I have brought hundreds of movies from Amazon over the years, and have always been extremely happy,<br />and for the first time, a new release which I have been bitterly disappointed with.<br />The quality wasn't even 95%. Almost like it had been copied.<br />What's going on Amazon?
0439023491|1.0|I read the first book in the trilogy and was hooked: the story line was interesting, the characters complex and the writing interesting. I purchased the second and third books immediately but was sadly disappointed. The emotional depth of the characters is lacking in the creativity department for starters. It is evident that the main character is troubled to say the least but this is something we know from book one. The author is not capable of helping us to see another side of the lead; there is no growth and she stops being interesting as her very well earned emotional troubles are rehashed, restated, and overly drawn out. She stops being complex, a character with problems you can look beyond and root for and becomes, a whiny teenage brat with little accountability for her own actions, no control of her emotions, and lacks the heroine qualities I had hoped for. Secondly, the writing is rather watered down. It's as if the author wrote a book for young adults and the over 25-crowd in book one and then decided she'd tailor the book to pre-teens. Don't get me wrong, I didn't expect Shakespeare after having read the first book as the writing did not lend itself to such an opinion, however, the second and third books were simply not well written and I couldn't help but feel that the author was trying to draw the story out, perhaps because she too loved the characters, but wasn't quite successful. As with all books in a series, you'll probably read the second and third but I would recommend that you stop with book one and write your own ending.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I loved this game. it kept me occupied for quite a while. the price is great too...there are games that are similar from G5 and they are asking $4.99! I refuse to pay that. so this game was totally worth the money. I became addicted! it is entertaining and challenging at the same time. I wish fire maple games would come out with more for the kindle fire. I have already played (and loved) both games they have on here! :)
B006OCM0G0|4.0|Love the game but only gave it 4 stars because you can't earn gems (except through adding neighbors, so add me please).

1401307450|4.0|A great little book, written by the lead singer of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, about his insane life. You can get all of the details on the man's deeds on the Wikipedia page (Grammys, multi-platinum record sales, Rock `n' Roll Hall of Fame induction, h-addiction), but this is the first person singular view. Kiedis starts it off with the typical underdog autobiography thing where he recounts in the first pages some messed up incident from his mid-twenties that is supposed to foreshadow/reveal something of his true character/convince the reader to buy the book by putting some action up front (drugs, Mexicans, lost personal items, dangerous situations, poverty, late for a gig), before jumping into his childhood (Keith Richards did the same thing).<br />You get the strange upbringing with divorced parents - mom in Grand Rapids, Michigan, wayward dad in Hollywood - and the contradictions (thriving on the edge, stoned on drugs, living on his own, yet pulling in straight As in high school). There are the various burnouts - drugs, car crash, diving off a five storey building and missing the pool - and recoveries, and the strange brushes with celebrity (Keith Moon used to sit at his dad's table when he was a club-goer and Anthony was a pre-teen, Keidis had a brief scene with Sylvester Stallone in F.I.S.T., etc). Kiedis goes over the strange relationship he has with his hard-partying over-compensating dad, with Grand Rapids, Michigan, with Hollywood, with his California high school, with his crazy musician friends, with his dissolution and homelessness and drug use, and with his many girls. Eventually, he's in a band with these musicians who are also in other bands (Flea played in Fear), and he's having wild and crazy sex with nutty little California chicks and... Nina Hagen! Wow!!!<br /><br />He also writes a lot about the crazy dances he invented, and the strange fashions he was into.<br /><br />\\"I decided to cut all of my hair really short except for the back, which was long, down to my shoulders. I wasn't mimicking hockey players or people from Canada, it was just my idea of a punk-rock haircut. It was probably inspired by David Bowie in his Pinups era, but it wasn't flaming red, and I didn't have the standing-up thing in the front, I had bangs. To people at UCLA, it was abominable. Even my friend were freaked out by it. But Mike (Flea) approved. He always said that one of my greatest accomplishments was that I had invented the mullet.\\"<br /><br />After a while, Anthony's band starts to take off, and so he's suddenly not interested in anonymous sex any more, he's off drugs; he's doing other things instead, like fighting with band members, putting out one hit song after another, playing with the Smashing Pumpkins, Nirvana, Peal Jam, headlining Lollapalooza and opening for the Rolling Stones (not fun, apparently). And then there's the endless cycle of relapse, rehabilitation and recovery, with a fair bit of intervention in between (as well as the h-addiction of other bandmates, friends and girlfriends).<br /><br />Kiedis composes long passages are about drugs, some of them really inspired, as he tries to make sense of his massive problem:<br /><br />\\"Once you've seen a solution to the disease that's tearing you apart, relapsing is never fun. You know there's an alternative to the way you're living and that you're oging against something you've been given for free by the universe, this key to the kingdom. Drug addiction is a progressive disease, so every time you go out, it gets a little uglier than it was before; it's not like you go back to the early days of using, when there was less of a price to pay. It isn't fun any more, but it's still desperately exciting. Once you put that first drug or drink in your body, you don't have to worry about the girlfriend or the career or the family or the bills. All those mundane aspects of life disapper. Now you have one job, and that's to keep chucking the coal in the engine, because you don't want this train to stop. If it stops, then you're going to have to feel all that other ssss.<br /><br />\\"That chase is always exciting. There are cops and bad guys and freaks and hookers. You're diving into a big insidious video game, but again, you're being tricked into thinking that you're doing something cool, since the price is always bigger than the payoff. You immediately give up your love and you light and your beauty, and you become a dark black hole in the universe, sucking up bad energy and not walking around putting a smile on someone's face or helping someone out or teaching someone something that's going to help his or her life. You're not cresting the ripple of love; you're creating the vacuum of ssss. I want to describe both sides of how I felt, but it's important to know that in the end all the romantic glorification of dope fiendery amounts to nothing but a hole of ssss. It has to appear enticing, because that's why God or the universe, creative intelligence or whatever you want to call it, put that energy here. It's a learning tool, and you can either kill yourself with it or you can turn yourself into a free person with it. I don't think drug addiction is inherently useless, but it's a rough row to hoe.\\"<br /><br />While the first half of the book is about his parents' backgrounds and troubled marriage, coming of age, discovering music and living a nutty existence, the second half of the book is much more sober as it gets into his girlfriends, band deaths and other crises, and his many relapses and interventions and therapies and rehabilitations. It also talks about his various adventures traveling around Asia (where he caught \\"a rare tropical disease called dengue fever\\" - which is actually not so rare, unfortunately) and Australia and New Zealand. There's also some stuff about buying houses in New Zealand (?!?!). Finally, it becomes about swapping guitarists and making tea, love and redemption, and occasionally about yet another physical setback (broken hands, feet, spines). Wow - what a nutty, crazy, inspiring life Kiedis has led.<br /><br />Finally, it's worth noting the four generous sections of personal photos of him, his parents (including his mom as a cute little five-year-old), and his girlfriends. You get to see a lot of skin, both from a pre- and post-tattoo Kiedis (who is known to perform nude) and his girlfriends Jennifer, Claire, Carmen, Jiame, Ione (Skye), as well. There are also pictures of this beautiful kid that Kiedis was, and pictures of his sick hippy/budding actor father as a young dad with his best pal. Funny comments on the young performer's early fashion sense too (hats, gloves, kneepads, buttons, skateboards, .

There's always going to be a kick-ass hero and an awesome bad guy ( this is why Tsui Hark's \\"Seven Swords\\" failed, despite some spectacular cinematography -- the villain wasn't awesome enough ). The hero and bad guy are supposed to defeat everyone easily except for those that are at his ( or her level ). The bad guy is supposed to be a \\"great fighter\\" with an \\"invincible style\\" (the more esoteric the better ) and the joy is watching the two duke it out at the end. I spent most of my childhood weekends in Singapore looking forward to  Shaw Brothers and Golden Harvest wuxia movies; that's what I was weaned on, that's what I love. In these movies, there is a fundamental principle:  great fighters do NOT get beaten by \\"inferior\\" opponents. If they are beaten, then the opponent has a \\"great\\" or \\"tricky\\" style of fighting. In fact the time it takes for the \\"hero\\" to beat up someone is a measure of the opponent's \\"worth.\\"<br />So here's why I find this movie, which is supposed to be a tribute to Ip Man and Wing Chun, to actually be extremely insulting to not only Ip Man and Wing Chun but offensive to all Chinese. Let me explain:<br />The first half of the movie is pretty good -- there are some great fight scenes: Ip Man butt kicks about a couple of dozen HK thugs impressively, and takes on a host of kung-fu masters,  not only defeating them easily, but more importantly, giving them \\"face\\" afterwards ( the Sammo and Donnie table fight is fabulous ). This sets up Ip Man as a decent, and honorable man, and that Wing Chun is a \\"worthy\\" martial art.  The scene with Sammo as a family man is also a nice touch.  If the movie had ended there, I would have given it 4 stars, and been quite happy.<br />The second half of the movie just pretty much destroys the entire premise of the first half.  In it, a caricature of a racist, white boxer, easily beats up Sammo ( who is supposed to be Ip Man's equal ), and takes Ip Man to the limit, before our \\"hero\\" finishes him off. Now I'm not saying that kung-fu is superior to Western boxing or any other martial arts in \\"real-life\\" -- that is a debate that can go on forever -- but in the world of Wuxia movies, Chinese kung-fu is supposed to be the pinnacle of martial arts! That's why I watch the hero practice endless hours of doing \\"horse stances\\" or sweeping floors for years, before being \\"blessed by the master\\" to actually become a disciple and learn the \\"inner door\\" secrets. If I watch a movie about Wing Chun, I fully expect Wing Chun to be the \\"superior\\" style.<br />The first half of the movie is spent establishing Sammo and Donnie's credentials, by showing off all their impressive kick-ass moves, convincing the general viewer that they aren't to be messed around with. In the second half of the movie, you are introduced to this lame, no-name Western boxer ( firstly, he has no pedigree and he's not someone famous-- like Joe Louis, or Sugar Ray Robinson, and secondly, boxing is hardly a mysterious, esoteric art )-- who would probably be in deep trouble if he wandered in some wrong inner city neighborhood -- go toe to toe with Sammo and Donnie. If I were not a martial arts fan,  from the principle of equivalence,  my conclusion would be: (1) Chinese martial arts is worthless because any decent boxer can take out a pretty good kung-fu master -- No need to search for a \\"real master\\" when any boxing gym will do, and (2) the Chinese really are pretty wimpy because one average white boxer is better than 2 dozen HK thugs. The jingoistic message of the movie (Chinese kicking Western butt), which is supposed to appeal to Mainlanders, actually backfires on itself.  Both the director, Wilson Yip, and the writer Edmond Wong, should have their heads examined, because in the rush to cash in on Mainland Chinese sentiment, they've destroyed the basic and fundamental principle inherent in all Chinese martial arts movies, and in the process, actually given credence to the \\"Weak Man of Asia\\" myth.
B0071T5PN0|4.0|I love it!! Really! I do. I was so impressed. I've heard that some of the songs were dusted off from the 70's and some were new. Who cares they rock.  I just hope they can make it through their Tour without breaking up.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|I loved this movie.  Great story.  I loved it so much I named my puppy Ellie.  Get this movie, you won't be sorry!
B007BLDFWG|3.0|Can see what writer and movie director were trying to do, show and they sort of pull it off BUT this topic would be hard for anyone to capture in a 2 or 3 hour film. Did like how movie switches back and forth, letting viewer experience confusion but confusion is about all one gets from this. Not a date movie. Not a comedy. Not funny. Oh, no sound track, which I do like. No dramatic, over done, musical score. But in the end, not sure I gained a lot of insight into the mind of the main character or other characters. Worth a look??  I not sure. Did not hate film nor love it. Does show its independent film production side with poor microphone work in places. Also not satisfied with ending at all. Confusion again and that is what I would say sums up this movie \\"confusion\\". Not recommended.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|This game is extremely fun and additive. Love the way it challenges you to think and though the graphics are simple they are crisp and clean. The only thing &quot;bad&quot; I can say about this game is that it would be nice to have a hint option as some of the levels can be very tricky. Otherwise this game is great and my preschooler and kindergartener love it when they can figure out the levels on their own. Great game for the kids to learn how to problem solve!!  A must have app for the Kindle Fire!!!
B001O37WTY|5.0|Love this film. Great story captured well on film. Acting is good, dialogue crisp and often funny. Highly recommend for any adult viewer.
B00650SSWG|2.0|Very slow, predictable.. Not worth my time.  I thought this would be funny but really, not so much.  My husband couldn't keep his eyes open until the end of this film.
B0035XVVDY|5.0|Interesting how easily one can side with the victim when it comes to revenge. This is a multiple clever revenge murder film. Not funny or a date movie. Moves along well from beginning to end and as I said, interesting that although murders are being committed, we tend to side with the murder.
B004XNGKBS|5.0|i love the update u added 2day. its smoother 2write and a lot of fun. i think t works great
B000TEMRXA|5.0|I grew up with Huey Lewis & the News (and Journey, Men at Work, Def Leppard..)so when I was able to download this disc off of Amazon for only $5 to replace an old, borrowed download that was low-bit WMA, it was a no-brainer for me.  If you were a fan of music's best decade, then you know that you love at least 4 tunes on this disc, and like at least 3 or 4 more.  A must have for a fan of Huey's music.
B006O3MU96|5.0|The original does have the Christmas theme, but it's not the same as this one. Besides, this version is in HD.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is about a young woman who mad a poor choice of a man for a husband. She plans out an escape from this life and comes across a different way of life, a better one.  Mr. Sparks has an uncanny way of writing from a woman's perspective.  The choices that are made through out the book keep you on the edge of your seat.  It is a mix of a mystery and love.  Loved reading this book and yet again could not put it down until I was finished.  Well done.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|best app to read the Bible. love everything. the live events the bookmarks and everything it reminds me I'm late on Bible reading plans. looooove it.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This bag packs a punch! I have had this for over 6 months, and its still holding up like new. I weighed it with all my gear in it, and it was over 13lbs. and it doesn't feel like I'm carrying that much on my back, and I went through 2 back surgeries, so the weight is not a problem at all.  I'm taking this with me to Yosemite in a few weeks, so I know it will come in handy. I highly recommend this bag for your camera and gear.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|Great graphics, fun puzzles, good number of levels. This game was a lot of fun and definitely worth the money. I'm very pleased with Fire Maple's games. (Played on Kindle Fire)
B000000W71|5.0|A new friend suggested I check out the late Gary Moore's videos and once I had heard a couple I came here to scope out the available discs.  I was looking for one that had One Day on it and this was the first one I found, so I bought it without hearing the rest of it.  Gee, I have tracked it for hours at a time and find myself singing Gary's songs throughout my day.  I am amazed that it took me so long to discover this major talent and chagrined that he is not here to make even more great music.  However I am thrilled that he left behind the body of work that he did and I WILL be picking up more of MOORE!
B005K17RU0|1.0|This ap worked sporadically on my kindle fire. I would constantly get the force close pop up. I finally uninstalled the ap.
1612130283|1.0|Ok, if you are going to recite a location of a city, interstate, and university - for the love of God LOOK AT A MAP. Seattle is NORTH of Vancouver and Portland. No one would take I-5 from Vancouver, WA to Portland, OR to get to Seattle, WA. You could go from Portland to Vancouver THEN to Seattle but not the way that it's written in the book. Also, if you reference a REAL university please reference the REAL city it's in. WSU is NOT in Vancouver.<br /><br />Forget the pedantic writing. The lack of fact checking is what pisses me off about this book.
B004I744AS|5.0|Very nice, neat, fast, good figures, more things to learn vocabs. This is more than a dictionary, this does not deserve even a 4.5 star!
B005VTS4EY|4.0|non stressful get rid of the bad blocks. basic and easy enough for younger kids too. glad I got it free too.

1410430103|4.0|The book was totally spot on, the story line gave an insight of what is expected of paperback. I really enjoyed this one.
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|I've been a fan of the Godfather trilogy films for years. Finally, I bought the book and what a read. It was even better than the film. I highly recommend this.
B00785P2QC|3.0|so far no problems every thing seems to be running in good time video is good I like virtual city games
B000022TSW|4.0|This is a great movie if you have a certain sense of humor.  However, it is NOT for kids.  For example, there is a brief gay male penis nudity in the movie (is why I docked the movie a star), which would be unsuitable for kids.  In fact, I think the whole movie is not for kids.  But if you are an adult, and you aren't anal and sensitive to insulting things, then this may be a good movie for you to watch.  Here's an example.  In this movie, Satan and Saddam Hussein are gay lovers.  No kidding.  Obviously, if you are even a little bit anal about this sort of thing, you will be insulted by this.  But if you don't care about being insulted, then this movie may be worth checking out.

B003HV0TN2|5.0|I am not a fan of fantasy books. I take pains to avoid reading one if I can.<br /><br />but this one blew me straight into the middle of the next universe.<br /><br />Never have I been so drawn into a book where I am able to read and re-read it over and over again and never be bored at any one time. Even the way it is written is so hauntingly beautiful that everytime I read it, I wish it were the first time I was doing so.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this book enough.
B00785P2QC|5.0|this is a very entertaining game. it will show how we truly get all of our supplys in our malls.
B004PGNB1K|5.0|An excellent sequel to \\"The Name of the Wind\\". I've waited for this book for an eternity and couldn't get it soon enough even with a pre-order.<br /><br />I'm not normally a fan of fantasy stories, and go to all lengths to avoid this genre, but after reading the first book, this series is by far one of the best books I have read in a long long time. Rothfuss does an amazing job of bringing the reader into the world of Kvothe, and the writing is nothing short of beautiful and engaging.<br /><br />A must read for anyone who hasn't come across good writing, or a good plot. While you are at it, get the first instalment and read that before reading this!
B0028R3G5O|4.0|I just got this collection today. I probably could have gotten by with She's So Unusual and one of her prior hits albums, but I just HAD to own \\"Hole In My Heart (all the way to China)\\". I love Vibes, what can I say.<br /><br />This is pretty much the choice cuts from her first four albums as far as I can tell, plus a few soundtrack picks. We get all the big hits from the debut, and almost all of the next two albums. For me it was nice to obtain \\"Iko Iko\\" and \\"The Faraway Nearby\\", as I only had the True Colors album on vinyl. My only complaint would be the non-chronological running, and that the booklet has nothing in it other than a weak bio. Still, the tunes are here, and the sound is satisfactory to my ears.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  It is interesting how he noticed everything and how a few small clues could tell him so much about somebody.

B0000VCZKM|5.0|I'm now sharing this movie with my 10 year old grandaughter. I saw it when it orginally came out. This anniversary edition was purchased at her request. Now we are making memories together,
0066214122|5.0|Years (approx. 10) after reading this book I still have vivid pictures in my mind of this story. One of Michael Crichton's best. You know it is a great book when you literally have to Google to see if there was a movie of it also, or the images you remember so enthusiastically were created purely from your mind while you read. I have read many books and only this one and 1 other did I have uncertainty like this about them. There was never a movie made of this (only, I believe, because they could not do it justice with out spending a fortune)... it was just a book- and what a book it is! You won't be disappointed... it even starts with the mystery quickly for those who don't like to wait.  =)
B005RK6EU8|5.0|Television-big-as-film. Very well written and acted. I'm a huge fan of the Doctor and River story line. This part of that story arc is preceeded by Silence in the Library and Forest of the Dead from season 4; Time of Angels, Flesh and Stone, The Pandorica Opens and the Big Bang from season 5; The Impossible Astronaut, Day of the Moon, A Good Man Goes to War, Let's Kill Hitler, and the last few minutes of Closing Time, all from season 6. The whole story arc is very-worth-watching. I so hope Moffat writes more of this story in Season 7.
1901464253|5.0|Very cool book for people like me: brompton fans.<br /><br />Book is wery well organized and it has lots of pictures about the history behind this great bike.
B003M1HN04|5.0|This episode is my favorite episode from this season of Doctor Who for interesting plot and character development. The seasons get better as they go. The last half of season 4 starting with Silence in the Library on to the end of season 6 (and hope it continues amazingly in the future with season 7) are in general stronger seasons than seasons 1 to 4a, but there are some wonderful parts in some of the early episodes, too. This one is very touching. I admit, the ending made me cry.
B001L5VRLY|5.0|I used to own this album on vinyl. I had forgotten some of the songs on it and forgotten how much work and skill used to be put forth by true musical artists. Songs from Yes, Going For The One, exemplify these artistic skills, and help to flood my memories of what once was, musical genius.
B006BSMY36|5.0|This episode really touched me. It's very well written and acted. I especially like the part about turning your weaknesses into your strengths.

1439190275|2.0|I read the 'New Diet Revolution' book in around 2004 and for 6 months or so it really helped me and my health and also helped me lose weight.<br /><br />The changes in this book include that: lean meat is okay to eat, there are more vegetables on induction, there are 2 paths in phase 4, and there are vegetarian options.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of the idea that losing a ton of weight per week is healthy, nor that soy products or rice cheese is a health food, or that Splenda or saccharin or protein bars are health foods, and I disagree that 370 - 625 of protein foods a day is NOT a high protein diet! I also don't agree that commercially farmed grain-fed meats and commercial diary products are health foods and found it disappointing that pasture-fed meats etc. weren't talked about in the book.<br /><br />This book is not as good as the original Atkins book. The focus is more on pushing the exclusive Atkins brand and products than on explaining the science here. It reads a bit like it was written by marketers, trying to twist Atkins a bit to make it fit a wider audience more easily. It lacks the passion of the Atkins books, from the man himself, as well as proper scientific information. It is uninspired and maybe over-simplified and would be in no way as convincing to those who had not read the previous books. It claims to be a whole movement on its own rather than part of one. I'm not sure Dr Atkins would approve of all of the statements in this book.<br /><br />While the Atkins diet is hands down better than any low-fat or low calorie diet out there, it is not one I would recommend to others any more. I feel there are better ones out there, which take the best of what Atkins has to say and go a bit further with making it a really healthy diet.<br /><br />I did really well on the original Atkin's diet with 20 grams of carbohydrate a day diet for 6 - 9 months or so. I felt well and had no more hypoglycemia and lost a lot of weight. But after that 6 months was up my body seemed to really struggle with it, perhaps due to the fact I have severe metabolic, endocrine, and cardiac problems. (I'm housebound and 95% bedbound and very disabled.) When I finally went back up to 50 - 75 grams of carbs a day (years later) I felt so much better, and finally was able to start losing some of the weight that had crept back on on my super-low carb regime. It was also a much more pleasant way to eat; being able to have 5 cups of veggies a day and a bit of fruit! Not eating so much meat was also WONDERFUL!!! I feel like staying on this super-low carb diet for so long delayed my health from beginning to improve as well, as it made my body work harder than it had to on food assimilation which of course leaves less metabolic energy and bodily resources left over for the work of healing.<br /><br />Books such as [[ASIN:0982720904 Perfect Health Diet: Four Steps to Renewed Health, Youthful Vitality, and Long Life]] explain that eating very low carb and making your body convert proteins to carbs puts strain on the liver and uses up bodily resources, generates ammonia as a toxic by-product, puts a person at risk of glucose deprivation if the are ill or lacking in certain nutrients and makes nutrient deficiencies more likely due to lower fruit and vegetable intake. Very low carbohydrate intake can also cause problems with vitamin C utilisation that may even lead to scurvy, as vitamin C is stimulated by insulin. For these reasons they recommend eating an amount of carbs daily which is very close to how much the body actually needs; 200 - 400 carb calories daily (or roughly 50 - 100 grams of carbs daily). I agree with these authors that healthy people will likely have few problems converting one macronutrients to another (such as protein to carbs, and carbs to fat) but for those of us that are ill it is best to save your body the work and to eat foods in the appropriate macro-nutrient percentages to start with. That just seems to make so much sense!<br /><br/>I really regret staying on Atkins as long as I did. But I just couldn't accept that the book was wrong, or that what worked for a while so well might be no longer working somehow. My very poor health is now finally very slowly improving and I feel my dietary change is playing a significant role in that.<br /><br />Where Dr Atkins really excels is in his book on nutrients and orthomolecular medicine. If you buy one book with Atkins written on the cover, make it [[ASIN:0684844885 Dr. Atkins' Vita-Nutrient Solution: Nature's Answer to Drugs]] for sure! That is a real 5 star book. It is still one of the best there is on this topic. It is an amazing achievement by Dr Atkins. I still refer to it regularly. I think it has just been re-released as an ebook too.<br /><br />For books on eating low-carb and high fat, and how to eat the foods we were designed to do best with and so improve your health through diet, I instead recommend books such as [[ASIN:1594774137 Primal Body, Primal Mind: Beyond the Paleo Diet for Total Health and a Longer Life]] (by far the best diet and health book I know of) and also [[ASIN:0982207786 The Primal Blueprint: Reprogram your genes for effortless weight loss, vibrant health, and boundless energy (Primal Blueprint Series)]] and [[ASIN:0982720904 Perfect Health Diet: Four Steps to Renewed Health, Youthful Vitality, and Long Life]] (without their 'safe starches!).<br /><br />5 stars for the work of Dr Atkins but only 2 stars for this very average book.<br /><br />Jodi Bassett, The Hummingbirds' Foundation for M.E./>I really regret staying on Atkins as long as I did.

B0073LJ61S|5.0|Van Halen has always been and still is one of the best American rock bands. Their new album is one of the best efforts that the band has ever released. There is not one bad song on this album. I love their summer time, party band sound. Eddie is at his best. Dave is still the ultimate rock band front man. Alex still thunders on the drums. And Wolfgang kicks ass on the bass. The songs take you back to the good old days of the band and rock on into today. There is no way anyone could legitimately have anything negative to say about this album or Van Halen.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|Season one is an excellent adaptation of \\"A Game of Thrones,\\" the first novel in George R. R. Martin's bestselling fantasy series \\"A Song of Ice and Fire.\\"<br /><br />If you haven't read the novel series: don't.  The TV series is understandable without having read the original novels.  A little background information could be helpful for you.  In a fantasy world, about 16 years ago the Seven Kingdoms were ruled by Mad King Aerys of the Targaryen family.  The Baratheon and Stark families (with many allies) overthrew the Targaryens, killing most of them.  Two small children, Viserys and Daenerys (Dany for short) were smuggled out.  When the novel begins, Viserys dreams of returning to the throne, now held by Robert Baratheon.  Robert's second-hand man (the \\"Hand\\" of the King) has just died under mysterious circumstances.  Robert heads north to offer the job to Eddard (\\"Ned\\") Stark, who rules the northern region of the Seven Kingdoms as a sort of governor.  Further north, the realm is bordered by a giant wall of ice.  Legend has it that monsters live north of the wall, but who believes in monsters?<br /><br />If you have read the series: I think the actors did a very good job in their portrayals.  The creative folks behind the series seem to have gotten the idea into their heads that \\"there are no bad guys\\" in the series.  This is not true, but it hasn't hurt the series yet (but Cersei is pushing it.)<br /><br />There's more sex and nudity than there was in the original first novel.  There's this really weird thing going on in this series that people are calling \\"sexposition:\\" either before, during, or after sex, some man is explaining to a woman (usually Rose, a prostitute, a character not in the novels who seems to have been invented for just this puropse) vital background data.  It's very difficult to pay attention to what the characters are saying while this is going on.  After the third or fourth time this happens, you're thinking to yourself  \\"Uh-oh, they're about to have sex.  Let me bring out my notebook, this is bound to be on the final.\\"  There's this one scene in particular where Littlefinger commands two of his employees to play with each other, well, I had to play that scene about 6 or 7 times before I was able to concentrate on what Littlefinger was saying.<br /><br />Regarding the special features of the DVD set:  There's a fold-out map that contains family trees with pictures of the main characters on the reverse side.  If you're new to the series, I advise that you look only at this, and do not look at any of the special features on the discs before watching all 10 episodes, because some of these contain spoilers, particularly on disc 5.  I tried to listen to a couple of the commentaries and got bored 5-10 minutes in.t to have sex.

B006C3Q6GG|4.0|Enjoyed the instruction in old timey sailing ships. Historical novels are the best. Characters not so well defined, had trouble keeping track of some.
B005LAIH2W|4.0|I am not one of those people who read the books as a young teenager and fell in love with them.  I'm one of those people who read the books as a young adult because they are a part of science fiction history and I felt I should know about them, and after reading them, thought, \\"Eh, they're okay.\\"  Heavy on the adventure, light on the science.  As adventure stories, they're quite entertaining.<br /><br />It's been many years since I've read the books, but from what I recall, the movie captures the feel of the books very well.  Carter has his \\"super-strength\\" and \\"super-jumping\\" powers from the books (John Carter was a pre-cursor to Superman).  Like most modern big-budget special-effect laden Sci-Fi movies, this is designed to be seen in a movie theater and not on your TV set.  The actress playing Dejah Thoris is very attractive (but wears more clothes than in the books.  Hey, it's a Disney movie, what do you expect?)<br /><br />The green-skinned, 4-armed Tharks were just a little too comical looking, but I suppose since most of the humor in the film comes during Carter's stay with them, this fits.  Another viewer left the movie saying \\"I'm so confused,\\" but the movie made sense to me, by and large, with the exception that the Thern's motivations aren't explained very well.  And since this is the 21st Century, they had to throw in a couple of lines related to environmentalism.<br /><br />All-in-all, not a bad film to see in a movie theater.  Watching it on a small screen will diminish the impact, as it always does for this kind of movie.
B00006LFGD|5.0|Barbra never dissapoints when she sings. This duet is beautiful and the people she chose to sing with her make this CD one of her best.
B005LAJ212|5.0|I LOVE THIS SHOW. IT KEEPS YOU WANTING MORE AND FOR ME I WOULD LOVE TO SEE EMILY GET REVENGE AGAINST THE PEOPLE WHO FRAMED HER FATHER AND FIND OUT WHY THEY FRAMED HIM
B005QYKE2Y|5.0|If you seen the first two you will definately find this one the best!  We first seen it in 3D at the movies and knew how good it was.  By far go get this movie.  My youngest son is a Transformers freak, and we've seen this about 1,000 times since we bought it!  Awesome Film!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is an EXCELLENT game. It is perfectly created and has a high resolution. I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I adore ALL 6 \\"story\\" Storm 8 games. ADD ME as a neighbor to ANY/ALL that you choose to download. These games are not just addicting, but are relaxing on your mind as well. For ALL ages. My Storm ID is: RareBug...  I'm a great neighbor!
B003L77GG0|5.0|Perfect!  Made my boys happy to be able to continue watching the series! Arrived in great ready to use condition.  Can't wait for the next season to be released.
B0063IH60K|5.0|very good game. play. all the time. will recommend it to anybody .you want to enjoy a great game, this is the one
B0024RIMBG|5.0|I gave this DVD to our daughter-in-law for her Birthday. Their whole family enjoys it, especially their 10 year old daughter. The DVD bounces with singing, dancing and musical instruments. It swirls with bright, colorful costumes, and beautiful, talented women. It is fun to watch, excellent family fun.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|I send this note people that are not aliens to play this game to kill the aliens.  Die aliens die.
B002VEB228|5.0|As another reviewer pointed out, it was interesting to think back on the things that I missed the first time I watched it. So I bought the dvd used for 1c on Prime to give it another go. Very exciting and suspenseful, you just really have no idea who it is. And what a surprise. Great performances by the four leads. And the scenery didn't hurt. The Na Pali coast is about the most beautiful place on Earth. My wife and I honeymooned on Kauai, took the same helicopter ride that's depicted in the movie, walked the same trails but not as far in. The cinematography captured the spectacular scenery splendidly and made it the fifth star of the film. Absolutely a must see thriller for everyone.
0446547654|5.0|Nick sparks lived up to his usual high quality writing with this book.  I didn't want to put the book down. I would recommend to Any sparks fan. [[ASIN:0446547654 The Best of Me]]. Purchased a used book in excellent condition. And arrived as promised.
B0012HQKZE|4.0|Don't know how I missed this excellent movie until now, and seeing it for free was sweet. As an outdoorsman I seek out survival movies and this was satisfying. Seeing neophytes think their way out danger was entertaining. I read reviews that give the bear all the credit but I thought all the main actors did a great job. The scenery of course was spectacular. Again, thanks Amazon for the free show.
B0046ECJBY|5.0|Sorry, my english is bad. The book is extraordinay. At least Y andestand elitle bit of China civilizacion and the turning point tah president Nixon and Mao Tse Dong acomplish.
B0058RN85O|5.0|Hilarious comedy, gets funnier with each episode...if you liked season 1, you must get season 2.  The situations that come up are very funny.  I love Phil!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the games are pretty cool and also a bit challenging. I also love the idea of buying knew games from the money you earn and not real money!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|love this app. If the  kindle fire keyboard was better, I'd use it even more. In the meantime I will keep on using it on my droid phone.
B0063IH60K|4.0|this is an easy to play game, a good time filler,don't appreciate the commercial before every new game but other than that its ok
B004FOA84A|4.0|I LOVE MYSTERY GAMES, SO I WAS EXCITED ABOUT STARTING THIS ONE. I'LL ADMIT AT FIRST I WAS VERY FRUSTRATED BECAUSE I DIDN'T QUITE GET THE GIST OF IT! ONCE I GOT INTO IT THOUGH, I BECAME OBSESSED, AND WOULDN'T PUT IT DOWN UNTIL I SOLVED IT! UNFORTUNATELY, IT ONLY TOOK ME AN HOUR TO SOLVE IT, AND VERY DISAPPOINTED, WHEN I GOT TO THE END, AND DISCOVERED IT WAS TRULY THE END.<br />I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT ONCE YOU FOUND THE GRANDFATHER, THAT'S THE END AND IF YOU WANT TO PLAY SOME MORE, YOU HAVE BUY ANOTHER GAME.<br />ALL IN ALL IT WAS A GREAT CHALLENGE, THAT ENDED ALL TOO SOON!
B005VTS4EY|5.0|I always play this on silvergames.com, and I am now so happy that it is on my Kindle! I think you should try it. The graphics are great too!
1594630844|5.0|This book is a must read for those, who like me, are mourning the loss of their youth.  I am 63 and found this book to be very uplifting.  So many of the people Pillemer interviewed had lived through the depression and WW II.  I loved hearing their responses to his questions.  I have highlighted all of my favorites and have recommended the book to my peers. It inspires you to want to go interview an elderly person!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|AFTER I read the book and purchased the other two books in the trilogy, I learned they were geared for adolescent readers.  While I had noted the book was an easy read, the plot was so dramatic that it really drew me in right from the beginning.  There´s lots of action and a bit of innocent romance in addition to the drama.  I think even older readers will enjoy it; I know I did and I´m in my 60´s!
B00133KFGW|5.0|The theme of August Rush reminded me of Tolkien's Silmarillion where Iluvatar (God) created Middle Earth and everything that exists with music. In that sense it seemed reasonable to me that August \\"heard\\" his mother and father calling to him with music while he was living in an orphanage never having known his musician parents. Music connected them even when hopelessly separated and music brought them together in the end, proving more powerful than the greed and ambition that is in the world.<br /><br />Nice story. Well worth watching.
B004SKIPXW|5.0|Nice 3D movie. 3d effects are good. Worth watching it.the movie was awesome also so I give this movie a 5
B006ON41FC|4.0|good game to kill time fun for multiple age groups easy enough for my 5 year old yet challenging. enough for me
B0015DROBO|5.0|Saw the triology - foreign films and the book was just as good, actually the book was better. Lots of twists and turns. Could not put this down.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a fairly good app, but it is hard to get lots of points without nonstop play. overall, a good game app. lots of classics.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|this little game makes you think at each level. it requires multiple trys at higher levels. then you can play again to get a better time. using kindle fire no issues.
B00006G8HX|5.0|Star Trek 3: The Search For Spock, in my opinion, stands up to any of the other 5 'Original Crew' films.  As Leonard Nimoy (who directed the film) says in the opening commentary track, they were going for big emotion in this film.<br /><br />They hit the mark!!!  It is a powerful film at times.  Acting is good.  Good storyline.  And, best of all, we get Spock back !!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />I don't know how you could like Star Trek and not like this film.
B002RVCD6O|5.0|This movie came in excellent time---less than a week to an APO once shipped, which means it will probably reach you faster. It came well packaged in the box, in shrink wrap. The disk plays with no problems. Definitely recommend using amazon to purchase this great movie! I am always happy with Amazon's quality of service.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|lots of variety, keeps you busy.  I love this game, it's very addictive.  I have it on my phone and my kindle.
B0076D20E8|5.0|My number one criticism would be perhaps the title and definitely the cover art. It looks like you are about to watch Hellraiser. Anyway this movie has all the themes of love, sex, politics and war, betrayal that you would expect from a Shakespearean piece. And they deliver with much of the Bard's verses being performed within the story. It's hard to know how much of this movies was based on fact and what is pure fiction. But after seeing this it is hard to rule out the possibility which the movie implies.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|easy and fun to play even my 2 year old can play with this game. its fun for everyone too
0761169253|5.0|Inspiring, concise, fun, well-written. Anyone creative should own this book! Some things I was already doing and didn't know was a common notion (productive procrastination), while others I had never thought of but have started doing (simple daily journal). Why are you still reading? Pick it up!
B004132HZS|5.0|I have been a Sherlock Holmes fan since I was a little girl and, to be honest, I didn't think I was going to like this show.  Sherlock in the current age?  Blasphemy!  But it is an AMAZING show!  They managed to update Sherlock but stay true to the Canon, which I didn't think was possible.  Martin Freeman is wonderful as Watson and Benedict Cumberbatch is a PERFECT Sherlock Holmes.  The cases are full of action with a dash of humor and the entire cast are completely believable (and fun to watch).<br /><br />This series should be a must for any serious Sherlock Holmes fan.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The Hunger Games Trilogy was amazing. Intoxicating, exhilarating, addictive, and poignant. Displayed the worst characteristics of humanity but also displayed why we are worth saving. If you love to read, I recommend this series.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is really fun and I enjoy it a lot. thank you! I really like how you have to redeem your points for more games.
B005VTS4EY|4.0|Colorful and interesting little puzzle game.  Simple game mechanics, but solutions require some thought after the first several puzzles.  Not particularly difficult, but fun nonetheless.  Recommended for those who like simple puzzle games.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|What a great book, and what a ride. Mr. Jobs will be sorely missed. I read this book on the Kindle app on my iPad and will be purchasing the new iPad 3. It's no wonder that the iPhone and the iPad dominate the market and everyone try's to keep up. Great company, great products, from a great man.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The Hunger Games series was amazing! From the beginning of the first book I could not put it down. The type of book is listed as 'young adult' but it doesn't come off as one at all. I am in my late 20's and thought the book was written very well and I just fell in love with it. I recommend this series to anyone, male or female, young or old.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|Read your Bible daily, no excuses anymore. God's word is all you need.<br />This app has more versions of the Bible than any other
B0073LWEXK|2.0|I don't know if I'm the only one with this problem but I'm stuck. couldn't find the red spring flower (and that's with using the hints)  and now I can't finish the game..I'm already on level 8 so I'm very frustrated @
B002ZG97LK|1.0|You know classics should never be remade. You know why because you cant fix profection. As in the movie Footloose.  The orginial Footloose was so good and then people say lets do it over. That should never be done because nothing is better the first one.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|Since most reviewers have already given quite indepth synopsis' of John Carter, I'll cut to the chase ... this is a fab movie!  One of the few well worth the cash to see on the \\"big\\" screen.  FX superb. Lots of action.  Terrific SciFi. May make buying a 3D TV worthwhile when the DVD becomes available.  A tad complicated for the wee ones but tweenies & above will certainly love it.  Enjoy!
B0055SWM08|5.0|I really enjoy this game.  They did a great job making the puzzles interesting but solveable.  Easily worth a dollar.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved this book.  I did not know anything about the story before I read it. In the first chapter I connected with the main character Katniss right away.  I finished the first book in one day and went on to read the trilogy within 5 days.  The author brings you into this new world immediately and you feel for all the characters because they are all three dimensional and become \\"real\\" to you. It makes no difference if they are \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\", they are all complex and complicated.  The author describes each location so vividly that if you close your eyes you are there.  If the movies are half as good as the books, I'll be happy to see them.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have found this app to be very useful. Whether you want to find a particular verse or compare the vernacular from one translation of the bible to another. Really easy to use.
B004AHNIGM|4.0|I have for a long time been a great fan of Gregg Allman.  This DVD was very good.  I enjoyed it.
B005V20JKI|2.0|great but after the update all my data got deleted.... I was level 63 and now idk if I'm gonna start over :(
B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this to use at home on days I cannot get to the gym.  Very pleased with the purchase.  It is a great workout, makes full use of the 30 minutes of work out!!
B004LWZW42|5.0|Great movie. If you like X-Men, and comic book movies in general you will love this DVD. My kids love it.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Great app but there's always room for improvement. I would like to copy and paste to other apps but can't.
B004023GSC|5.0|I bought these shoes for my toddler to wear to swim class and around the pool.  She loves them.  No complaints!
B000QCSA54|4.0|Everyone has heard the expression \\"common sense is not that common\\". And this book brings home that point. In reading the book there is nothing earth shattering that you don't already know. But sometimes things you know are not at the top of your mind and thought patterns. If you are at a point of reviewing you current path it is a good read.
B0042FZOFU|5.0|This was a great purchase for a reasonable price and 3 classic movies.  It came in as promised.  No complaints!
B006FTC6ZC|3.0|One thing is for certain:  Way too many people are being way too generous on these movie-ratings.<br /><br />Let's put this in perspective, shall we?<br /><br />First of all, a 5 star movie (to me) means that the movie is basically \\"perfect\\".  Sorry-I have<br />yet to see a \\"perfect\\" movie.  Ratings SHOULD be in at least .5 increments, as to more accurately<br />give potential viewers more clarity as to just how \\"entertaining\\" a movie truly is. We are denied this, clearly.<br />So, having said that, let's get back to the ratings.<br /><br />A 4 star movie (actually, a 4.5 or 4.75 ideally) would be a movie like \\"Braveheart\\" or \\"Titantic\\", \\"Ransom\\", \\"Forest Gump\\",<br />\\"Man On Fire\\", etc.  Outstanding quality in almost all categories.  Premium movies, if you will.<br /><br />3 star movies account for the majority of flicks that I personally view.  3 Star movies basically means this:  The movie was entertaining at a level that suggests that yes, indeed, the 1.5 hours you invested to watch such movie was time worth \\"wasting\\" on such movie, but by no means is the movie a stand-out from the crowd, nor a truly \\"powerful & engaging\\" film.  It's a \\"watch once, reap SOME enjoyment\\" and move on.  Again, this makes up the bulk of movies out there.<br /><br />2 star rated movies, obviously, are those that are really just not worth that 1.5 hours of your time.  Other activities in your life to partake in would more than likely be the better route to take, than to sit through one of these movies.  However, the value of a 2 star movie comes into play when the potential viewer truly has NOTHING else to do, and perhaps gained \\"salt-sized particles\\" of enjoyment.  These movies stink, basically.  A laugh or two, or a scene (or two) brought some value, but nothing else.<br /><br />1 star rated movies are horrid.  They are/were a waste of time, and often can leave the viewer a bit upset that they just in fact \\"threw away\\" 1.5 hours of their time.  These movies usually are \\"laughable\\" inthat they just stink that bad.  Not much more to say about these.<br /><br />So, here we are to this specific movie.  I will not carry on with my review, because truly all you need to know is that the movie is a 3-star movie.  Enjoy.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|good game.  simple but challenging.  great game when stuck in an airport.  some puzzles require a day or two of thought...or you can get lucky.
B005R9U5EA|3.0|Wow.<br /><br />All I can say is, \\"wow\\".  (To those who have over-rated yet again another movie)<br /><br />Folks?  This movie is a 3-star caliber movie.  Decent.  Engaging enough to warrant the 1.5 hours of your time, with some solid substance here, but not much more.<br /><br />4-star?  lol...uh, no.<br /><br />Semi-creepy atmosphere, decent acting, and some \\"mystery & unsureness\\" about what's going on, but that's it.  Period.<br /><br />3-Star movie, and honestly? I recommend you fine folks start tracking my reviews if you truly want the most precise & accurate \\"reading\\" on where a movie \\"falls\\" into this 5-star rating system.<br /><br />Clearly others are just wrongfully & laughably tossing around 4 and 5 stars towards movies that aren't even close to being at that level of quality.
B004I744AS|5.0|Superior to all others so far. Translates has horoscopes and weather and much more. You can download it as an offline app too if you have a spare gig. It has a copy function so you can paste definitions into an email. I haven't figured out how to forward from within the app itself, but I just started using it. A very good dictionary and so much more. Dictionary. com app looks pretty sad next to this one!
1609611543|5.0|My sister called me about this book after she was diagonosed as having a wheat allergy. She thought about all of our problems we have been having and thought I should try this way of eating too.<br /> Six weeks later, I have lost 7 pounds, and can make a fist again since my fingers are now working again.  I also find myself forgetting about breaks and lunches because I am not hungry all the time like I was when I ate wheat products. The energy boost is amazing!  Please take time to read this book and then put it in action.  I don't feel deprived, I feel alive!
B002BWP49C|5.0|I love this one. my favorite, by far, of all the Twilight movies.  a really enjoyable movie. thanks so much
B004WQ304G|5.0|I would highly recomend this movie even if your not a harry potter fan definately  a 5 out of 5 star movie great story line and fun for the kids and if you buy on amazon you can pick it up at a fraction of the cost you would if you found in your local retailers so sign in and pick yours up today
B004SBQAN8|5.0|This one has it all, including surprises. I couldn't totally figure this one out til the end. good job thank you
B005VTS4EY|5.0|Having a lot of fun trying to save the green blocks. Recommended it to many people. Like having a time limit but sometimes find the &quot;gravity&quot; challenging.
0439023521|5.0|First off, let me say how appalled at some of the reviews that were written. Many positive and negative reviews contain some severely false information about the plot to misguide the readers of the reviews.<br /><br />Second, if you're an adult who is contemplating on reading THG, keep in mind that this is an YA novel. So with that don't expect some superior writing style or complex plot or teenage romance to make sense. It seemed like many reviewers of this book were comparing apples to oranges. You cannot compare a novel like Battle Royale to this one just because they are the same genre. Battle Royale is a non-YA fiction and was translated from Japanese to English.<br /><br />Some reviewers were upset that THG was a combination of other works and accusing Collins of being a thief. Perhaps these people don't know the meaning of \\"inspiration.\\"  Collins explained where the idea came from (War in Iraq, Greek myth Theseus, gladiators, etc). She took those ideas and cleverly intertwined and embedded them into a fresh plot.<br /><br />And then there were reviewers who took this book way too seriously and personally and criticized it for being too unrealistic, too violent, too political, etc. Of course it's unrealistic and political because it's a dystopian genre (maybe they don't know the meaning of \\"dystopian\\" either). And the concept is violent, yes, but Collins does not give graphic, gory details of the violence. For example, one of the characters gets tortured by some muttations.The idea of torture is violent but she doesn't give details of the torture except that the character was alive during the hours of torture and was moaning in pain. There were couple of scenes which were more descriptive, but I personally think they were not too much for YA. Here's an excerpt from what I think is the most descriptive/violent part of the book (this is a scene where the main character, Katniss, and another character got stung by a tracker jacker wasps. The girl dies and Katnisshas hallucinations from the stings): \\"Her features eradicated, her limbs three times their normal size. The stinger lumps have begun to explode, spewing putrid green liquid around her. I have to break several of what used to be her fingers with a stone to free the bow. ... I try to roll over her body by pulling on one arm, but the flesh disintegrates in my hands and I fall back on the ground..... Trees transform to blood and splash down my boots. Ants begin to crawl out of the blisters on my hands and I can't shake them free.... Then the ants bore into my eyes and I black out.\\"<br /><br />If you're a parent, I highly recommend reading it first and then determine if your child is mature enough to handle the heavy concepts that are presented in this book (war, poverty, oppression, death). I'm a school teacher and have seen mature 5th graders read this (with parents or teacher) and handle it pretty well.<br /><br />I personally think that this book really cannot be judged by itself, without reading the rest of the trilogy. So much happens in the rest of the trilogy that you will not get the whole picture until you have read the last words of Mockingjay. By end of Mockingjay, not a single character is the same. I spent few days afterwards thinking and trying to figure out the changes that occurred in the characters and why Collins wrote such an ending. The mere fact that I could not stop thinking about it until I was satisfied with my analysis was what I loved about the book. It made me think deeply about those core concepts previously mentioned. A book that can drive a person into deep, serious thinking surely deserves a 5 star rating.
B003JH8LPW|1.0|This is technically very interesting,but I feel it has too much of the \\"gee whizz\\" factor about it. None of the characters seem like real people,or am I out of date?
0307949486|5.0|A real page turner! It started off a little slow at first, my friends warned me about this, but after that I couldn't put the book down. It was a real thriller. I don't see the need to review the entire book, since there are already thousands but I would definitely recommend this book to anyone looking for a great book. Already reading the second one now, I couldn't wait.
B005KNV9LG|5.0|If you liked Tony Bennett's first duets album, you'll really enjoy this one too!<br />Well worth getting this album. I recommend it.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|Overall I like this app...but when I'm at work I don't have wi-fi so its no good. Had to get another from Olive Tree.  On my Kindle that is...I have password for the Church's wi-fi, but yesterday it wouldn't connect.  Glad I have the OT version that doesn't need it.<br /><br />Works great on iPhone...just wish Kindle version didn't need wi-fi.
1416955070|4.0|The book City of Bones by Cassandra Clare is a story about Nephilim, better known in these pages as Shadowhunters.  The legend of the Shadowhunters begins when \\"a warlock summoned the Angel Raziel, who mixed some of his own blood with the blood of men in a cup, and gave it to those men to drink.  Those who drank the Angel's blood became Shadowhunters, as did their children and their children's children.  The cup thereafter was known as the Mortal Cup.\\" (pg. 78)<br /><br />This story begins at the club Pandemonium when Clary, the main female protagonist, witnesses a murder that no one else can see.  Latter she is attacked by a demon and finds her mother has been taken.  Before this, Clary's life had seemed fairly normal; she was very artistic, loved to draw and enjoyed hanging out with her best friend Simon.  However, the events of the attack pull Clary into a strange, new world that she never knew existed.  This scenario reminded me of the TV series Blood Ties (2007), where Vicki Nelson, a half-blind private investigator, witnesses a murder that draws her into a world filled with demons and vampires.  In both stories, it's the witness of a murder, seen through a kind of blindness, that opens the door to a strange, mythical world.<br /><br />Jace and his two companions, Alec and Isabel, who are all Shadowhunters, find themselves helping Clary try to locate her mother while unravelling her hidden past.  They use the powers of Runes to help them with their constant battle against demons and other Downworldly creatures.  Eventually, Clary develops the Sight and is able to see the new world that she is in, one that has always been around her but she has been blind to.<br /><br />With the help of her new friends, they discover that Jocelyn, Clary's mother, has a secret past and is believed to be hiding the Mortal Cup.  They all work together to try and save Jocelyn and find the Cup before it falls into the wrong hands.  One might interchange this adventure with the questfor the Holy Grail, another mythical cup that is said to have miraculous powers.  In an adaptation of Robert de Boron's, Joseph d'Arimathie from the late 12th century, Joseph captured the blood of Christ in the Holy Grail while burying him. Once again, a comparison could be made here: the Mortal Cup holds the blood of the Angel Raziel while the Holy Grail in some stories holds the blood of Christ.<br /><br />At the same time as Jocelyn's disappearance, Valentine, a rogue Shadowhunter, has emerged after he was thought to be dead.  He is after the Mortal Cup and plans to use it for his own terrible means.  It is a fight against time to see who can find the Cup first.  Meanwhile, it is discovered how all the characters' stories are connected, and their lives are more intertwined than first believed.  One might find a mirrored story being told in Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi (1983).  Here the audience discovers three characters whose secrets and hidden relations are revealed by Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi.<br /><br />The City of Bones unfolds into a cinematically-told story.  The analogies and descriptions paint a portrait in the mind's eye.  I couldn't help but notice all the names of artists being used: Rembrandt, Magritte, and Bosch just to name a few. Also, words such as chiaroscuro and fresco make we wonder if the author has some sort of art history background; it's not every day you hear that kind of lingo.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who loves fantasy and is up for a good teen read.  The story combines countless mythical creatures from werewolves and vampires to fairies and mermaids.  It brings to life the biblical Nephilim but gives them their own twist as Shadowhunters.  The story deals with relationships at all levels from friends and family to lovers and foes.  I did feel the story lagged a little in the middle, not really advancing the story line, but this was easily overlooked by the strong ending.  The writing was beautifully done with words that really brought the story to life.  My imagination was working on over drive.  This was a great teen read.  I'd recommend it if you'd like to take your mind on a wonderful adventure.

0060873027|1.0|MICRO:  A NOVEL by Michael Crichton and Richard Preston.  Grossly disappointing.  While jacket copy says \\"At the time of his death in 2008, Crichton was well into the writing of MICRO\\", I don't buy it.  The style is nothing like that wonderful author's prose.  The characters are mostly cartoons, the dialogue is extremely flat and full of \\"as you know\\" lectures, metaphors are clunky, and the story line is mostly a version of 1940's movie, DR. CYCLOPS.  Most non-Crichton, however, is the lack of science driving the plot and its complications, and unintentional humorous phrases like \\"coming from the depths somewhere above.\\" (p. 141).  In fact, much of the book seems to be written in the structure of a training presentation, i.e. \\"1) tell them what you're going to tell them; 2) tell them; 3) then, tell them what you told them.\\"  -- PDPautz
0670022950|3.0|Well Written but the author makes no predictions about the future.<br /><br />The author deals with the developed western world so even if violence has decreased in Scandinavia, and the British Commonwealth it has not changed much in the rest of the world during the last thousand years. Pinker should confine himself to his area of expertise and avoid historical extrapolation in which he has no credentials. For example, the wars in Iraq (still ongoing IMO) Afghanistan and Syria are just continuations of the Crusades that began in the 11th century and never ended.<br /><br />Given the spreading ubiquity of CBR and nuclear weapons, apocalypse is inevitable. It's like the stock market; people generally know what will happen- they just don't know when.<br /><br />I found the chapters on the neurobiology of violence the most interesting parts of the book but they belong in a separate volume.
0439023491|5.0|The book Catching Fire by Suzanne Collins, the sequel to The Hunger Games, is a really good book I encourage everyone to buy this book and read it. When you read it, it's like you're really there. Katniss and her Fianc&eacute; Peeta the main characters, are in some big trouble with President Snow: they must find a way to get themselves and the ones they love out of District 12 or they will die.<br /><br />You will fall in love with all of the main characters and hate all of the bad characters. When you get to the climatic parts of the book your heart races like you're the one being captured or caught. If you thought Katniss and Peeta were done dealing with the capitol, you were WRONG! So many things are going on with Katniss ever since she \\"Rebelled\\" against the capitol by trying to keep herself and her \\"lover\\" Peeta alive with the berries. President Snow didn't like that too much so he's back for revenge. Katniss is in for a treat, and as for Peeta, all he can do is stand by and watch.
0374275637|5.0|This is a superb illumination of a portion of the story of what we are about.  The human mind is unbelieveably complex, but here are some of the properties involved in how we think, and why.  This should effect how you see yourself and others; hopefully in a useful way.
0451169514|5.0|What can I say?  This book has everything.  Great characters who are easy to identify with, a great story, expert writing.  This is the best book I have read by Stephen King (I've read about half of his works).  Words really can't do it justice.  Some may complain that the book is too slow, or that there is too much detail.  After all, the plot is fairly straightforward.  There is a monster killing kids in the little town of Derry, and a group of them decide to do something about it.  However, the detail is the whole point of the book.  You get to know the characters, even many minor ones, like old friends.  Each one faces problems that everyone faces growing up.  You even get to know the town itself, which is in and of itself a character.  The book wouldn't be the same if there wasn't so much attention to the little things.  The deaths of the children that are outlined here would be meaningless if we didn't know anything about them.<br />Maybe the book isn't for everyone; there is a huge amount of language, gore and sex.  The subject matter is, all at once, gruesome, upsetting and very depressing.  however, if you think you're up to it, give this book a shot.  I read this book during the last month of summer vacation of my Freshman year in high school, and, I can honestly say, the book is grounded in reality.  Despite the supernatural aspects of the story, this feels real.  All the people that are used in this story feel as though they could be your next door neighbors or a kid down the block.<br />If you ask someone what this book is about, they'll likely say \\"A demon clown kills kids.\\"  Yeah, that's the basic storyline.  However, read the book for yourself.  You'll uncover an incredibly gripping, well written novel that will make you keep reading until there's nothing left.  This is the best book I have ever read.
1451673442|3.0|I read \\"The Secret\\" and am relieved that Rhonda Byrne has provided us with a fuller picture of the Law of Attraction. What really bothered me about \\"The Secret\\" was the pervasive, inherent \\"selfishness\\" of it: \\"Get yourself a multi-million dollar home! Get yourself a Ferrari! Make yourself filthy rich! Yourself! Yourself! Yourself!\\"<br /><br />I'm glad that Rhonda Byrne has realized this, and has addressed it in \\"The Magic\\" with her concept of Gratitude. The only somewhat troubling aspect of this is that Angelica Crystal Powers' \\"The God Academy\\" has ALREADY provided us with the full picture concerning the Law of Attraction: for maximum effect, your intentions MUST include generosity and love. Purely selfish wishes don't resonate with nearly the charge of wishes born from higher intentions.<br /><br />I like \\"The Magic\\" and recommend it for its message. I just hope that, in considering its similarities to \\"The God Academy,\\" from the sacred texts to her concept of gratitude, Rhonda Byrne did indeed come to these truths in her own way.<br /><br />For me, when it comes to the Law of Attraction, \\"The Magic\\" is a good pocket guide, but \\"The God Academy\\" provides the fullest understanding yet. Its truths are so intuitive and powerful, and so uplifting and full of hope. I hope in writing this that someone else will find it as enriching for their life as it was for mine.

B004ZY0VHY|1.0|This book is a devastating picture of the annihilation of a family from within, by the very person who should be the nucleus.  It is dark, disturbing, and one of the most horrifying books I have ever read.  As I got close to the conclusion I realized what was going to happen and I quit reading in disgust.  Though the theme of this book might have offered a study in psychopathy, the author offers no practical or redeeming information.  It is a bleak, disturbing, and very dark book; there is no comfort in its resolution.  Don't waste your time or money on this book unless you can tolerate extreme despair and heartache.
B0041L2E7G|5.0|These headphones are perfect for long workdays, as they are comfortable in the ears, allow some surrounding sound to come through (for safety) and stay ON without getting in the way. I let the cords run down my back to my Sansa Clip, clipped to my back pocket. The 2-pack with splitter was perfect, giving me a spare pair plus an often useful splitter. The audio response of these headphones seems to be extemely accurate, with crystal-clear treble and accurate, but not overpowering, bass.

B002VWNID6|1.0|Well from reading all the reviews this appeared to be the release that had the movie on ONE side. That's why I purchased it, as I already owned the 2 sided movie and thought in buying this one, I could view it through its entirety. Too much of a hassle to send back. But, super disappointed that I wasted my money. So, if you think this disc is one sided---it is not. BEWARE.

0439023513|5.0|Reviewed by Suz & posted at Under The Covers Book Blog<br /><br />This is the last book in the Hunger Games trilogy, we finished Catching Fire with the realization that District 12, Katniss's home, had been completely destroyed and Peeta captured by the Capitol and Katniss is now welcomed into the once thought annihilated District 13. The third and final book in this emotional and action packed series shows us Katniss becoming the Mockingjay, the symbol of the rebels and their freedom from the oppression of the Capitol. And once again Katniss finds herself used a pawn in a new and different kind of Game orchestrated by District 13 and their President as they use her to further their own ends.<br /><br />All I can say is WOW! this book had me so twisted up, I couldn't put it down, I literally sat and read it from end to end in one sitting, more often than not with tears dripping down my face. It was so emotional as you watch events unfold and Katniss breaking apart and all the characters fall...this book has a high body count and is not for the faint of heart.<br /><br />As for Peeta vs Gale argument, I thought it was rather moot at the end, everyone had changed so much that it was the last thing I was thinking about. What I liked about this book was that it really showed the characters growing and maturing becoming adults as they are faced with horrific situations and became shaped by them. It made them very real showing both their flaws and their strengths.<br /><br />This whole trilogy has been brilliant, definitely among the best books I have read, all three have kept a steady pace of action and character and plot development. It has kept me wanting more and kept me emotionally engaged (or strung out!) in all three; I believe I have shed tears whilst reading all three books! The storyline is both high on entertainment with the fast paced action and thought provoking, this isn't a mindless action book about the People vs the Evil State.<br /><br />And this book did get me thinking. Were District 13 and President Coin any better than the Capitol and President Snow? They were both ruthless in their goals, using any means necessary to achieve it; they both used Katniss, in the end they both wanted to destroy her. And there was a part at the end that led me to believe that they probably weren't, just different sides to the same coin (no pun intended!). I think what struck me was the thought that in the end war leaves no one unscathed, especially the victors, and Katniss and Peeta seemed to be a perfect example of this. They both had scars that will never heal inwardly and outwardly and people they will never get back; in the end it seemed like a rather pyrrhic victory to me. But then again I didn't go into this book expecting a happy ending.d get me thinking. Were District 13 and President Coin any better than the Capitol and President Snow?

Props to Suzanne Collins: an author I think everyone will have a hard time upstaging.
B004EPZ00C|1.0|Doesn't even deserve the honor of being called a parody. An obvious Bond 007 takeoff that was just dumb, not funny. Had that silent movies slapstick feel in which the viewer's time is better spent in watching the originals. Slapstick was funny the first time through especially since movies were still a novelty and anything that appeared on the screen was capturing, but reruns just get old. Basically the plot is of an MI7 agent who continuously makes stupid mistakes that help the bad guys more so than if he did nothing at all. Not to be confused with, or even in the same conversation with, the Peter Sellers' Panther movies although there seems to be, politely stated, a lot of borrowing from his movies.

Even though its tone is serious there is humor interlaced throughout. The art direction is superb; every scene is authentic. It's ostensibly a martial arts film, but characters (both Japanese and Chinese) seem real; the direction is terrific. I watch it over and over.

B004UOCF3W|4.0|The Foo Fighters latest release \\"Wasting Light\\" is what real Rock n' Roll sounds like.  The songs are are fast and hard with moments of genuine pause and reflection.  The muscianship is great, Dave Grohl's voice is both angry and desperate but always reflects genuine feeling and moments tenderness.  The Drums, in my humble opinion, are the heartbeat of each track and are excellent, which is no surprise given Grohl's prior experience as a drummer for Nirvana.  The Foo Fighters are the saviours of 21st Century Rock n' Roll.  Pop music is dominated more and more by producers and computer whizzes teaming up with a vocalist. The Foo Fighters show the superiority of Rock n' Roll: real muscianship, guys who took the time and care to learn to play musical instruments well, then took the extra step of learing to play together as a band and who then blow you away.  The result is a muscular, high-energy onslaught of pure Rock n' Roll, they way its supposed to sound and the way its supposed to make you feel as you bob your head to it.  I bought this album and I love it.  You should too.[[ASIN:B004VN5MNC Wasting Light (Deluxe Version) [+Video] [+Digital Booklet]]]

B004EPYZV2|2.0|Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol is a terrible movie.  The plot is a joke.  The studio appears to have locked five writers in five different rooms and told them to write a scene based on a city.  The  scenes were then stiched together with a totally implausible plot.  At the end, Tom Cruise's character can't even beat up an old white guy in a colonel sanders suit.  Terrible, terrible movie.

B002SSUQFG|4.0|I purchased this watch as my first foray into mechanical watches, knowing that it was a budget watch with excellent credentials, and calibrating my expectations to this.  I have not been disappointed.<br /><br />First things first, this watch is NOT a Japanese movement, and buyers should not expect a Japanese movement, regardless of what Amazon's description may say; I did not, at this price point.  The movement is designed by Seiko in Japan, but produced in Malaysia, and the markings on the watch clearly indicate this.  I have contacted Amazon about this, but they do not seem to show any interest in correcting their ad copy.  Caveat emptor.<br /><br />The movement in this watch as purchased in January of 2012 is a 7S26C.<br /><br />I have been tracking the accuracy of the watch I received for about 50 days now, taking the time once a day from both the watch and a clock disciplined by the time signal transmitted by the observatory in Boulder, CO.  The long-term accuracy is excellent, with an aggregate drift of 13 seconds over this time period.  The daily drift is variable, with nearly 1/4 of daily readings showing no change at the second granularity, and 3/4 or more of the readings within +/- 2 seconds per day.  I don't know how other units may compare to the one I received, but I am quite pleased with its performance.<br /><br />The case finish seems to be plenty hard, and is very even and relatively attractive.  After nearly two months of wear there are no apparent marks or dings in the finish.  The crystal appears to be very hard (likewise no apparent marks there), certainly harder than the Skagen crystal I wore previously, and is very flat and not unduly prone to reflection.<br /><br />I had concerns about the nylon band looking cheap, but it is reasonably classy and matches the style of the watch body.  The clasp and keepers are stainless steel with a matte finish, with the clasp appearing to be cast and the keepers extruded wire.  The butt joint of the wire keepers is clean and well-deburred, and of course not visible when the watch is worn.<br /><br />The lume on the hands and dial is very efficient, much brighter than any watch I have previously warn (which is pretty much limited to Timex and Skagen in recent memory).  It is also evenly laid.  If I had a complaint about the lume, it would be that the 12 o'clock position bears the same small dot as all other positions, making it easy to read off by one hour mark if you must read the watch in an unusual position.  This is not a show stopper, but it does require some care.<br /><br />As others have noted regarding the 7S26 caliber, the rotor is a little bit noisy.  I do notice a rattle from my wrist from time to time going about my daily business.  On the other hand, it is plenty efficient.  I do not consciously wind the rotor unless I have had to lay the watch aside for an extended period of time (such as when working at a particularly dirty or wet task for the better part of a day), and then I give it no more than a couple of twirls, if anything.  I normally wear the watch 24/7 and I have not had any stoppages.  When first starting the watch after receipt, I twirled it for 5 to 10 seconds, put it on, and didn't give it any further special attention.<br /><br />All in all I feel this is an excellent introduction to mechanical watches, and a good everyday watch for the price.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* More than adequate everyday accuracy<br />* Casual but not \\"cheap\\" look<br />* Good fit and finish, quality materials, feels solid<br />* Light and slim for an automatic<br /><br />Cons:<br />* Band appears likely to be good for only about a year (time will tell)<br />* Occasional rattle from the winding rotor<br />* Malaysian movement finish is workmanlike but not particularly fine
B007H7XJD4|4.0|As long as you know what to expect, you'll be entertained by this movie. Read the reviews and decide if you want to see it is my advice. The movie is in line with my expectations, so I was very satisfied. 4 stars from me.
B001MSMUH0|2.0|Ken Robinson went to school with Paul McCartney, one of many names dropped in the first few pages.  This is like every corporate inspiration talk ever given.  His thesis is that we should find our passion and do it, which makes sense, but he makes his arguement by citing various world-famous people who didn't do well in school.  I'm sure it's all true, but for us non-Nobel Prize winners, I'd say you should stick to the books and try to get good grades.  Maybe it got better after the first few chapters, but it was repetitive after the first few pages and I didn't make it to the end.

B005LCYR7Y|5.0|Not the usual SK genre, for those of you expecting horror  and frights at the turn of the page you will be disappointed. This was such a REAL book i kept  looking for the headlines in the papers. Very interesting and thought provoking concept. What would have happened had JFK lived??? The lead up to \\"saving\\" him was very probable and I was intrigued from the first pages. It was a hard to put down book and I read it quickly. I recently read his  \\"Under the Dome\\" and enjoyed it for the same reasons as above but it became very untidy at the end and was not as satisfying as it could have been. This book however is very well finished and satisfying and fairly plausible given the fact that we cannot go back and change history. I would recommend this book for any reader, Stephen King fan or not, except the lovers of horror. You would probably think it was lacking as there is no horror in it. Do not expect it to be classic King. I have recommended it  to my friends who do not like SK and they have been surprised at how much they enjoyed. Buy it!

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have never been a great fan of Stephen King but, this book was by far one of the most enjoyable reads I can think of. I picked this book because of my love of all thinks Kennedy and I also like time-travel and alternate history stuff. By the time Jake had met Sadie I began to enjoy his personal story more than the Kennedy stuff (not that it was bad and the conclusion to his mission was nothing less than riveting).  I would recomend this to anyone who enjoys reading because this is just simply a very well written novel and I am reading it for a second time already after blowing through the 800+ pages in 2 days.  Amazing!

B007IXWKUK|3.0|Book 1 was pretty good.  The sex was provacative and interesting, and kinky.  Book 2 was ho-hum.  Christian came off acting like a controlling creep, and Ana went from someone with character to a whiny doormat that all of a sudden started caving in to Christian's juvenile anger.  When they weren't getting mad at each other for minor infractions, they were having flawless perfect sex.  Really?  How about a conversation every now and then about real issues?  And now they're getting married?<br />Ana's constant references to her \\"inner goddess\\" were so weird--I tried as hard as a I could to skip over them, as well as her sub-conscious references.  Just strange.<br />Overall, I felt like the book was a series of sex scenes with a less than average story threading them all together.  Not sure if I'll get the third book or not.

1451627289|5.0|If you've read the description, you understand the premise: An average guy has the opportunity to change a significant moment in history...but history doesn't want to be changed.  The writing style seems to me to be typical King.  The story is interesting, as alternate histories can be, and reasonably well-paced.  There are a few fun, non-distracting references to his other stories, as he considers most (if not all) of them to be part of the same multi-verse.  I'm not always a fan of King's endings (let's say 50/50; and while he'd probably say they're all just \\"ka,\\" I think he sometimes enjoys leaving the reader as uncomfortable at the end as in the middle), but this one was satisfying.

B0034G4P4O|4.0|Not being a previous fan of the Tin Tin character I can't say how good of and adaptation this was. However as a film it is incredible. The animation alone is reason to watch this, it's so good you almost forget your watching an animated movie. This movie has so much going for it. Incredible action scenes, rich characters, exotic locations and of course a lost treasure. Andy Serkis the king of motion capture is awesome as the bumbling drunken Captain Haddock. The only reason this film isn't 5 stars is that it's overall shallowness. Not that it's a problem while your watching it, but it might just be kind of forgettable for some viewers.<br /><br />Definitely a must see.

However, sadly, both the novel and the film's major plot line of Sarah and her key is rectified around the halfway mark of both pieces. As the murkier central story of a journalist whose marital issues and unplanned pregnancy shifts the mass horror of the Vel D'Hiv roundup into the smaller arena of moving past personal tragedy, the significance of the message seems less intense, diluted by one woman's trouble and some trite classroom telling instead of being the sole monumentally emotional grab of the piece. In that sense, the incident seems marginalized in the face of smaller personal issues that effect a few not thousands.<br /><br />Not that the overall feeling of the film is any different from the book.  The fact that over 80,000 Jews were ultimately deported to death camps by French authorities during Marshal Petain's Vichy Government is depicted with a heart-wrenching simplicity as seen through the frightened and cowed eyes of the determined ten-year-old Sarah Starzinsky played with precocious perfection by M&eacute;lusine Mayance.  Discovering these more personal events triggered by the Vel D'Hiv roundup of 1942 from the vantage point of the present day is Julia Jarmond (Kristin Scott Thomas) who brings her unflappable perseverance to uncovering the details of a disturbing story to light despite the reluctance and ambivalence of others who feel the story might well be best forgotten.<br /><br />Is Julia just a hysterical woman flooded with pregnancy hormones and angst regarding her marriage that she simply must see the Sarah story to its endpoint?<br /><br />Writers Serge Joncour and Gilles Paquet-Brenner segue from the past to the present with ease, weaving the atrocities of the past within the arena of guilt and discomfort that defines home for their Julia.  Following the book closely, they report Sarah's story adequately, but fall short when the titular key unlocks the door in the wall and quite frankly, there is no where to go from that point on to balance the emotional drain.  Thankfully, this writing team decides not to pursue the romantic entanglement in which the novel's Julia eventually indulges.  The addition of the William character in De Rosnay's universe seems an attempt to add some yang to all the yin--the idea of having Julia bank her future happiness on Sarah's only son smacks of a contrivance that has no place in a story of such devastating emotional intensity.<br /><br />Let's face it, the only event that could have turned the tale around and brought out a bright smile and a few tears for theatregoers would have been a complete rewriting of the outcome.  Sarah rushes to the cabinet and unlocks the door--or, more practically, Jules and his wife take charge as adults would and move the poor girl out of harm's way so they could open what could well be the macabre sight of the boy's crypt.  As the door swings open, surprise--no one is there.  The emptiness suggests another mystery--where is the child?  Who took him? All of this could have flowed into the present story very nicely and provided the intrepid Julia with a flicker of hope, that she could fan into a huge magazine human-interest feature.<br /><br />Bottom line? Paquet-Brenner's adaptation of \\"Sarah's Key\\" by Tatiana De Rosnay follows the plot of the book faithfully for those who are devoted fans.  Young actress M&eacute;lusine Mayance and Kristin Scott Thomas as the two leads add solemnity and stellar acting to a story that because it hinges off a devastating negative event that is never balanced by one of equal positive power, it fails to emotionally satisfy.  Thankfully, Paquet-Brenner leaves out De Rosnay's contrived ending allowing the overall Holocaust awareness message first and foremost despite weighing against one of the main character's personal problems.

0439023483|2.0|This is an easy read, and a quick one.  The plot is simple and the action reasonably paced.  The amount of creativity in developing the future world is minimal.  The insight into people's behavior is limited.  The explanation for why the evolution of the \\"Games\\" is not developed.  The repeatedly fortuitous escapes of the two heroes are contrived. There is little character development and what is present is stereotypic or unrealistic.  Why does everyone seem to just like Katniss?  Why do they all want her to win?  How can she be so clueless about her feelings toward Peeta?  Give me a break....<br />Should be a good movie only because with strong videography you don't need much of a plot, and decent actors can infuse some character into the flat characterizations.

Home recipes make it easy to cleanse your hair with a green routine if that is your preference.

It's a work in progress. ;)<br /><br />I recommend this book to everyone I know that has curls. Even my curly guy husband is using it, and is finally growing out his curls because there is hope!<br /><br />Detailed instructions and information on how to recognize and care for your particular curl type, and daily routines for women, men, and children!

B000002KKS|5.0|The Heaven and Hell album not only features Ronnie James Dio's Sabbath debut on vocals, but also a slightly new musical direction for Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, and Bill Ward. From the opening moments of Neon Knights, there's a sense of renewal, of an invigorated band with refreshing energy finding new heights of creativity. Iommi boldly riffs away, confident that his new singer will push every verse to lofty heights, and Butler and Ward plug along like driven musicians. After the enthralling opener, Iommi shows off his new approach to incorporating acoustic passages, not to mention a style of heavy rock riffing that, hand in hand with Dio's voice, can't help but recall Ritchie Blackmore. Lady Evil further displays this shift in direction, barely even sounding like anything from a previous Sabbath album, but more like Man on the Silver Mountain. Next comes a bona fide Black Sabbath classic, the epic title track Heaven and Hell, which combines the theatrical grandeur of War Pigs with the blues thump of Sabbath's debut album. Godlike riffs and solos, Dio's purely golden voice, Geezer's hypnotic pulse, and Ward's big band drumming make this one of heavy metal's all time great individual songs. It's nothing less than captivating. After this, Wishing Well veers into a lighter style that sounds like a tune straight off of Never Say Die, but still with a renewed energy, highlighted by an absolutely hyper performance by Geezer. Die Young ups the ante in this regard, seeing Sabbath rip away at breathtaking speed that is quite removed from the groove-based doom of an older album like Master of Reality. Iommi's solos on this song will make your head spin! The pace slows again with Walk Away, another track similar in style to Never Say Die, but given a completely different kind of arena rock feel by the way Dio's soaring vocals carry the song. The album closes with Lonely is the Word, it's mean-sounding Sabotage-era riffs, mellow mid-section, and epic vocal performance by Dio punctuating the end of a spectacular release from Black Sabbath. Heaven and Hell stands up to any of this band's best work and will always be regarded as a landmark in the world of heavy metal. There's an aura of greatness in these songs that can't be manufactured, but happens organically when the chemistry between bandmates finds a perfect harmony. Tony Iommi and Co. were rarely better than they were here.unctuating the end of a spectacular release from Black Sabbath.

0312641893|5.0|Cinder, in a nutshell, is riveting, suspenseful, unique, and swoon-worthy. And I'm not sure those words are really sufficient. For a slightly extended version, keep reading. (Warning: There may be slight spoilers in the first several sentences):<br /><br />Set in the New Beijing Commonwealth after WWIV, Cinder is a loose re-telling of the classic story of Cinderella. It has all of the classic elements:<br /><br />1. (Step)-father who has died, leaving step-daughter at the mercy of the step-mother<br /><br />2. Evil step-mother<br /><br />3. Two step-sisters (though only one is \\"evil\\")<br /><br />4. A trusty side-kick (though not a band of mice)<br /><br />5. A forbidden ball to attend<br /><br />6. Prince Charming<br /><br />Cinder is left part human, part cyborg after a fiery hover crash in which she not only lost her parents, but also her memory of her life before the crash. She is adopted by a family in New Beijing, where humans and androids intermingle and a Letumosis plague is running rampant.. Shortly after she arrives to her new home, her step-father, Garan, is infected with Letumosis, taken away, and dies soon thereafter. Her evil step-mother, Adri, resents and blames her for the death of Garan and essentially makes Cinder into a household slave. She is forced to work as a mechanic to provide for the family, and to wait hand-and-foot on Adri and her two step-sisters. Cinder is friendless, except for her youngest step-sister, Peony, and the household android assistant, Iko.<br /><br />Sounds miserable, right? It gets worse.<br /><br />When Cinder's world collides with Prince Kai, son of the dying, Letumosis-stricken Emperor, her life turns upside down. She is assigned to fix Prince Kai's android, Nainsi, who holds classified data that must be protected. However, before she can fix the android, Peony, is stricken with the plague and taken away to the Letumosis Quarantine Compound.<br /><br />How's that for a gripping beginning?! I could totally write a full-story synopsis of Cinder, but it's impossible without spoilers, and really you're here to read what I thought of the book. Right? ;-)<br /><br />Cinder is the perfect mix of sci-fi, paranormal, romance, dystopian, and suspense. There are also some political and social aspects that I really enjoyed. I was pleasantly surprised at how truly good this book is.<br /><br />The characters were so unique and realistic, each written with a distinctive personality and voice.<br /><br />Cinder has to be one of my absolute favorite YA female protagonists - ever. I know that's a pretty lofty declaration, but if you read Cinder, I think you'll agree. She suffered a horrible accident that left her part-cyborg, and thus, a second-rate citizen; she's been put upon for most of her elementary and teenage years; she has a step-mother and step-sister that despise her, and only two friends to speak of in the whole world. Most would say that this type of life is grounds for a bit of self-pity. You won't find that in Cinder! She's fiery, independent, intelligent, witty, and a skilled mechanic. She also cares deeply for Peony and Iko, and is fiercely loyal to them. She doesn't take hand-outs and would rather keep her mouth shut about the trials she suffers than to elicit pity from a passing stranger.<br /><br />In contrast to Cinder, her step-mother, Adri, is such a wicked woman. She blames Cinder for the death of her husband and despises her for what she is, and because of this, thinks she has the right to abuse Cinder mentally, emotionally, and yes, physically, though not in the traditional sense.<br /><br />Peony, Cinder's little step-sister, is sweet and loving. She doesn't see Cinder through the eyes of her mother or older sister, and has her own mind. I love this about her character.<br /><br />Iko is the coolest android I know! I wish I had an \\"Iko\\" of my own :-) She's got quite the personality and is loyal to Cinder through everything. Everyone needs a friend like that... even if theyaren't human!<br /><br />The main antagonist is Queen Levana, who rules the moon and its inhabitants, known as Lunars. This woman embodies evil, and she does it so well. Queen Levana is truly the villain you love to hate. When she tries to weasel her way in with Prince Kai and the people of New Beijing, you just want to throttle her! Well, I did anyway :-)<br /><br />And then, finally, Prince Kai... Oh, Price Kai ::dreamy sigh:: He's everything a Prince Charming should be: Smart, handsome, witty, caring, loyal, and honorable. He is on the precipice of becoming the succeeding Emperor of New Beijing and is not too proud to admit that he's scared, but when the time comes for him to \\"man up\\", he does so with grace and aplomb. Prince Kai is also very tender with Cinder, and even though she constantly throws a wrench (no pun intended!) in his plans to be heroic, he never gives up on her.<br /><br />You won't find Insta-love!© in Cinder. While there is a bit of romance between Cinder and Prince Kai, it builds and blossoms over the course of the book. When you've been abused and mistreated like Cinder has, you don't just fall into the arms of any man who shows you some attention, even if he is a Prince. As a matter of fact, girls, don't ever do this, period!<br /><br />The plot really had me turning pages. It may draw from Cinderella, but Cinder is still completely unique, from the post-apocalyptic setting and Letumosis plague, to the android citizens and Lunar Queen. I love the little twists and turns this book takes. Some things were predictable, given that it's a loose re-telling of an age-old story, but the ending WAS NOT!<br /><br />As soon as I read the last word of the book, I looked around frantically for the next one. (Yes, I am a book addict, and my name is Katie.) Unfortunately, Cinder lovers will have to wait a WHOLE YEAR for Scarlet, the next book in the series, in which we will meet another former fairy-tale character, and where Cinder's story will continue. How will we ever survive?!<br /><br />Marissa Meyer truly did a stand-up job with making Cinder the foundation of her series. Some people have complained that there are a lot of questions left in the reader's mind about how the world came to be populated with androids and cyborgs, who the Lunar people are and where they came from, and so on. I actually enjoyed the book because of these unanswered questions. What can I say, I love using my imagination! Maybe some these questions will be answered in the books to come...<br /><br />In closing, Cinder is a brilliant debut that is sure to charm and engage readers of all ages for years to come. If you are a woman or young lady who is looking to be empowered by connecting with a strong female character, Cinder is your girl! I plan on passing along this wonderful story to my 11-year-old niece, and I hope she is as inspired as I was.<br /><br />Oh, and if you haven't yet read Marissa Meyer's short prequel to Cinder, do yourself a favor and check it out! It's called Glitches. Be warned, though: it may whet your appetite for more!aren't human!<br /><br />The main antagonist is Queen Levana, who rules the moon and its inhabitants, known as Lunars.

B006M4RN3U|5.0|...Yeah, probably a turn off if you think about that proposition for too long but in all honesty, that was my first impression of this album. Having said that, this is one of the most diverse set of songs I've heard in ages; all of them interesting and often suprising at the same time. The one criticism I have is the over use of auto tune on several of the songs; Stars being the worst. A really nice song absolutely ruined. I can't understand why such an accomplished band could think this was a good idea. Even though I think the album as a whole is worth 5 stars, I would love to have seen it released auto tune free.

1451683405|2.0|When I heard that Harris, one of the most prominent leaders of the \\"New atheist\\" movement, was coming out with something new, I was pretty excited to check it out. When I looked it up on Amazon, I was absolutely thrilled, because the title made it obvious that he would be addressing one of my favorite subjects. I saw it was $10, so I, non-hesitantly, clicked \\"pre-order\\" and went about my day.<br /><br />When the package finally made its way to my doorstep a few days ago, I opened it up found that my prior excitement was stifled on account of what I was holding: a pamphlet. I didn't properly check into the work, so I figured I would be holding a 200 page, semi-exhaustive academic piece on the nature (or, non-nature, more appropriately) of free will, with great atheist insight enlightened by the best in neuroscience. Instead, I flipped through the pages confused, trying make sure something hadn't gone wrong with the order. Then, I realized that this was, indeed, the \\"book\\" I was expecting. I was somewhat insulted that such an acclaimed thinker could muster the audacity to seriously attempt writing on such an enormous and controversial subject in 70 \\"pages\\" (at 14 pt. font, quarter inch spacing, and 1 inch margins, the booklet should have really only taken up 40).<br /><br />Finishing it after dinner that evening, my shock at the size of this \\"book\\" had flipped 180 degrees: I couldn't believe that, in 70 pages, someone could actually say so ridiculously little. From one boisterous claim to another, Harris seemed all the more intent on rattling cages than actually providing clear, logical, and substantiated arguments for these monstrous assertions. Time and time again, I felt like I was listening to the erratic argument of a 17 year old youtube \\"atheist\\" who had stumbled upon some scientific evidence that had the potential to mean something, but didn't take the time to actually formulate what that was. Though some of Harris' statements would actually take hundreds of pages to evidence and argue persuasively, the booklet seemed to be a 70-page abstract of something that he *should've* actually written about (and that, no doubt, most of us were hoping to read about). Instead, we are left with the mention of a couple of notable scientific experiments (some real, some hypothetical...) that are worth considering (but are not nearly as conclusive as Harris not-so-implicitly leads on) in the debate over free will, and an absurdly disproportional set of claims to accompany this \\"evidence,\\" as if 2+2 =7 billion. I've now read it for a second time, and I have seen little change to my original opinion of this pamphlet: it is, unfortunately, just an insult to the discipline and some of the great scholars who have undertaken it.<br /><br />I will give respect where it is due, and Dr. Harris definitely has the credentials to make great claims and be listened to (within the parameters of his area...), but this is clearly (at least, I hope) not his best work. Though I respect both of his alma maters and look forward to his work in the future, I'm not sure that this pamphlet would pass for a senior thesis at my old undergraduate university; there's just too much asserted and not enough said to support it.

I even know that not all bills are monthly, not to mention almost all non-reoccurring payments that must be payed in the future (imagine that!).

It's a double album and as it goes with most double albums, there's a lot of songs that don't do anything at all for the flow of the album.<br /><br />Disc 1 for instance starts off with a preachy-like song/intro (if there's anything I don't like, it's being preached to) that is meant to introduce the principles of the Five Percent Nation. It's cool if they want to have their beliefs but this is music and I'd rather be entertained. That is followed by \\"Reunited\\" and THAT should've kicked off the album because that song is incredible. The first disc for the most part is amazing.<br /><br />Disc 2 starts off with RZA dissing rappers who use R&B to make their songs flow and then we get the classic masterpiece \\"Triumph\\". After that, the songs are completely hit or miss. One minute the track is great and the next, it either feels forced or just lame. The closing track is basically hitting home that people should be following the Five Percent Nation values. I thought that tacking that on the end was wrong and people should form their own beliefs.<br /><br />Regardless of some of the preachiness, there are some really good songs on this double-album. Over time, most of the members of the Wu developed different beliefs than the Five Percent Nation ones for the record. These guys are extremely intelligent so it should come as no surprise. When you listen to this, keep in mind the perspective and the times. Also, luckily the songs aren't preachy except for what I listed.<br /><br />Having said all that, I recommend this album. Glad they didn't do a clone of \\"Enter the 36 Chambers\\".
B00729GQ0A|5.0|this is a great book. there are alot of vampire type books out there and it is good to find one that is different from the rest. great job Rebecca :)

B005UG542S|3.0|The movie had all the expected excitement and special effects. Some things were explained and some left me wondering. Perhaps, had I read the book, I might have understood more. I found the ending of this series anti-climatic. Knowing it was the end of the story had me going into the experience feeling a little sad. One of the main characters turned out to be a \\"good guy\\" and not the bad one everyone thought, just as I hoped. This last chapter included the traditional \\"happy ending\\" that J.K. Rowling decided was needed to bring closure to the story of the young wizard who grew into adulthood along with his good friends. It wasn't as good in terms of story line, nor as intriguing as some of the other movies, but it was very entertaining, and I felt good when it was over.
1594744475|3.0|I have to admit that I was REALLY excited and looking forward to receive this book after reading so many good review on it. But I was a little disappointed after I received it.<br /><br />I appreciate the auothers for doing a great job in introducing what needed to decorate a cute bento, sharing their ideas of how to make adorable animals bento etc.<br /><br />However, if this book could have more pictures and show exactly step-by-step picture on HOW to make a bento, that would be really great. The big picture on the left page show the cute bento upon completion; however, the right page - especially right bottom have lots of empty space, if step-by-step pictures could be shown, that would really be of great help to a 'visual' person like myself.<br /><br />In the end, I bought another book: - I find that more useful.<br />http://www.amazon.co.jp/akinoichigo%E3%81%AE3%E3%82%B9%E3%83%86%E3%83%83%E3%83%97%E3%81%A7%E4%BD%9C%E3%82%8C%E3%82%8B%E3%82%8F%E3%81%8F%E3%82%8F%E3%81%8F%E3%81%8A%E3%81%B9%E3%82%93%E3%81%A8%E3%81%86-%E7%A8%B2%E7%86%8A-%E7%94%B1%E5%A4%8F/dp/447992034X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1331534849&sr=1-1

0307352145|1.0|Quiet is the worst book I've ever read.  I cannot read for more than ten minutes without falling asleep.  Warning: never read this in bed, because you WILL fall asleep in ten minutes, guaranteed.  Or your money back.  Haha, just kidding.  But I wish I could I get my money back.  The author is super preachy, and the book has no plot whatsoever.  The author just preaches on and on for 352 pages, except for a few mildly interesting stories spread throughout.  The topic isn't boring; Time magazine recently did a very interesting article on introverts.  But Susan Cain does not do this subject any justice.

B000B8QEYC|4.0|\\"Amarantine\\" means everlasting, which this album, sadly, is not. And it's quite unusual that her fourth album \\"A Day Without Rain\\" lasted a mere 34.5 minutes, yet it was enough to hold over Enya's eager fans for 5 years until the release of \\"Amarantine\\" in 2005. This album is much longer than its predecessor, but also not as memorable. Also, it will not hold you over for another 5 years for new material. So it's contradicting to name an album everlasting, when its content is not a very memorable collection of tracks. But some things to also keep in mind:<br />1) Her vocals. True, they've always been heavenly and have captivated us from day one, but her full utilization of them here is what sets this album apart from the rest, she's finally mastered a consistent, sweet sound that is devoid of any grit or any other vocal hindrance, just pure angelic voice from the woman who invented the term \\"Golden Pipes\\"<br />2) The Music. Once again, her music has always been a strong aspect of her career and what ultimately leads people to buy her albums. But what she has done with this album is that she's also learned to fully use her resources and produce songs that don't just set a lovely mood, but rather soothing songs that have real substance. So she's also mastered singing insubstantially, but not making the music itself silly or fluffy.<br />3) The Lyrics. When you listen to Enya, you don't really hear the words she sings, just the tone of her voice and the amazing production of Nicky Ryan. She has changed that with this album by making the lyrics the forefront of her songs and not just filler to give the song a purpose. So she's also mastered the perfect balance between unearthly sound and sentimental lyrics.<br />All of these mentioned points are what save \\"Amarantine\\" from the possible tragedy it could've become. Yeah you won't remember too much of what you heard, but in the moment you are listening to this collection, you won't be disappointed. Highlights of this albuminclude the title track \\"Amarantine\\", my track pick \\"It's In The Rain\\", and \\"The River Sings\\", one of three tracks in which Roma Ryan's fabricated language \\"Loxian\\" is used. Enya hones all of her abilities here, even if you forget what you've been listening too after a while, she's done a nice job in leaving you wanting more, to wait until she released yet another album with more songs straight from the hands of God himself.

B004EBT5CU|5.0|This is the best CD I have purchased in a long time. Not a bad song on it. A couple of the songs are hits, but I think there are a few more that could also be hits.
0061969656|3.0|I love Bernard Cornwell and have read nearly all of his books,  That having been said, I thought that \\"Death of Kings\\" was one that I could have skipped.  It seemed that I had read most of it before in the other books of the Saxon Tales.<br />If your new to his work,by all means get this one. You will enjoy the action and the characters. And the geography lesson on England is always enjoyable.

0984999302|5.0|Love It!  This is an excellent resource for entrepreneurs who are thinking \\"startup\\" ... and want to get it right the first time.  As the cover states, this is a \\"step-by-step guide for building a great company\\".  Definitely not a novel .... more like a textbook.  Lots of helpful tips and checklists.  Alas, the only chapter missing is one detailing exactly how to convince your spouse to support your new venture.... this is my next hurdle .... more to come on that subject!  This book is a good find and would be a valuable addition to your desktop resource library.

B006OOHYIC|5.0|It's mentally stimulating as well.  The intrigue of the more difficult puzzles makes it hard to quit playing.  This is one of the best puzzle games ever.
B004JN1D2I|1.0|I have read these books before and they are great but shouldn't the Kindle Edition be cheaper in price than the physical books?  That is, after all, why most people got the kindle.  Well that and not having enough shelf space for our books. However, I think you could cut the price by half for the kindle version since there isn't any over head.  I expect better Amazon.
B0000C5RQF|5.0|To be very short and to the point:<br />I love this recording.  I would like a larger DVD opera library, and I would buy more quickly if I believed they were as watchable as this.  The disc sounds good.  It is fun to watch.  The production is modern and thoughful.  The staging is surprising and fun.  The video editing is somehow appropriate; not that the singers are playing to the camera, but that the camera has been planned for and is not an afterthought.  I am completely in love with Keenlyside and Roschmann. In summary, this is a recording that I can easily put in front of people that 'don't like opera', and know that they stand a fine chance of getting the bug!<br />WThompson

B004G5ZY7E|5.0|a really good read---fast paced and hard to put down!!If  you like a thriller, you will enjoy this . It starts at a good pace and continues.
B000XR4OC0|2.0|If you see someone with Tom's on, chances are the heels or the toes are messed up. The shoes are comfy, nice for slipping them on to go to the store real quick but not for everyday use. The quality is very poor. I appreciate their buy one give one thing but I'm pretty sure that a child in need of a pair of shoes walk way more than the average American. If I barely wore them a month before it started to fall apart...what about the children who receive these shoes? (I hope you're reading this Blake!)
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I read all three books , and this one was the best!! I loved all the characters. A well written book. The ending was perfect!!!
0552555592|5.0|This is the most recent in the Tiffany Aching arc of Terry Pratchett's Diskworld novels. The Aching books chronicle the progress of a young girl as she grows up to become one of the witches of Diskworld, aided and abetted by the Nac Mac Feegle (AKA the Wee Free Men)a  clan of Pictsies, or wee folk of a definitely Celtic/Scottish persuasion.<br /><br />Although billed as a juvenile/YA series, the Aching books can be enjoyed by Pratchett fans of any and all ages. As always the book contains liberal helping of Pratchett's trademark wit, wisdom, satire, and sharp observations of human foibles.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Now his father may be writing the review, but I am not kidding when I say my son came up with the title.  Great game for kids ages 5+.  I worry it may be short, but first impression means a lot in the cheap app department.  From the point of view of a husband and father, this can mean all the difference in why you own a Kindle Fire in the first place.
B006GHA9QQ|3.0|The production was actually a lot better than I was expecting. The costumes and set from the Melbourne production were absolutely gorgeous. The musical itself was decent, if maybe a bit confused at time. It still had trouble getting over its biggest flaw, it was trying to be Phantom. Even putting aside the obvious character assassinations needed to make this story work, the music was just not on par with the original. \\"Love End Dies\\" was a lovely song but I did not for a second believe it was something the Phantom would have written. The original was a Victorian Gothic/High Romance and the music set the mood for that theme and it synced up. Love Never Dies simply did not have the same cohesiveness. I liked many of the songs but some of them just didn't fit the tone of the rest of the show. Meg's songs sounded like they'd be more at home in a more modern musical like Wicked, \\"The Beauty Underneath\\" felt like it should have been in a rock opera like Repo! and the other songs just didn't reach the same heights as Phantom of the Opera. That's not to say they were bad. I genuinely like \\"The Beauty Underneath\\" and \\"Devil take the Hindmost\\" and I still find myself humming \\"Only for You\\" sometimes. But being a sequel it has the sad misfortune of constantly being compared to the original and I simply didn't feel it measured up. Is it worth seeing? Yes. Is it worth buying? Sure, but I think I'll wait to get it used.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Fine application. Easy to use.<br />Like the reminders to read daily.<br />wide variety of options to use.<br />the encouragement emails are nice.
B005HEVPEY|5.0|Ok, so I like the Janeway character... So sue me... I think the series is spectacular... I am a hardcore Star Trek fan no matter which version...<br /><br />So many different plots, so many episode to choose from... The characters are all very cool... Like the fact that anything can happen on a ship  with the First Officer from another race and a part or the crew of the said race willing to mutiny at the drop of a hat, but tying to work together to find their way back home before they all grow old and die...<br /><br />Some scenes are predictable, most keep me guessing how it was gonna all end.

B004FOA84A|3.0|I played their newer game Lost City first and found Grisly Manor to be a little disappointing. I beat it in 20 minutes, whereas Lost City took way longer and had more puzzles and artifacts to find. If your looking for a good game with lots to do get Lost City instead. Can't wait to see what they come out with next :)
B004XDYJRU|5.0|this app oz great! you get thousands of stations and you can have your very own presents and recordings. all in all its good
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Reminds me of those Mist/Riven days. Great app. The scenery is spectacular and collecting artifacts and solving puzzles entertaining. Can't wait to play their next game. :)  HINT:Try playing without using hints, it is much more rewarding when you complete the game.
0060873027|1.0|I love the best of Michael Crichton: The Andromeda Strain, Jurassic Park, Disclosure, so I was jazzed when I saw this come out. I just hope to God his name was pasted on this truly awful mess solely for marketing purposes, since I cannot believe he actually wrote it. Here the Snidely Whiplash-level stereotypical corporate evil-doer shrinks the kids, a bunch of microbiology graduate students in this case, and sets them free in a Hawaiian jungle where they do battle with bugs and baddies. The superficial attempts at vaguely plausible scientific explanations of how this occurs are ludicrous. The characters and dialogue are laughable. I stuck with it about halfway before chucking it.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|Very nice package and a lot of extras. But I really think that the menus are a mess. In the Animatrix DVD, we saw a real work on the menus. So I bougth the Animatrix DVD in solo a few days later, just for collection purposes.<br /><br />So in general terms, is a must have copy of the Matrix trilogy. Great sound, image and quality of the set.<br /><br />Best regards

B005KP7EK4|4.0|I was in the mood for a western and this movie did not let down.  Everything you could ask for in a western.  Some parts a little slow but the writing is good. In a western town you can't trust many people. This story has some twists.
B004LROUNG|4.0|The book starts out making you wonder how this will pan out. Characters are very real to life. I enjoyed the ride. I really liked that in the end the little guy gets the big company. John Grisham never disappoints.
B004X80QNG|2.0|Not very intuitive/user friendly. Constantly asks for Google login throwing an error saying the password is wrong. Developer is ignoring requests to address the issue.  I would not recommend the App.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Amazing! The Blu-Ray version makes Episode I bearable to sit through. The main menu is very helpful and 10x better than the DVD version. The sound is also greatly improved. If you don't have a surround sound system then I'm confused why you have Blu-Ray. The Blu Ray version undoubtedly made every part incredible and vibrant. Not much changed in regard to new scenes. The older versions need a little bit more love. You can tell that the quality is not the same. It is funny how awesome the Storm Troopers are in Episode II and Episode III but somehow become clumsy in Episode IV. There are bonus discs that have extra features and are worth the extra money and time to view. This is a great saga to share with the whole time. Also, Star Wars encompasses the ideal that mythology never dies it gets retold in different forms. The fight of good vs. evil is retold. It is worth your money. Can't wait for the 3-D Blu-Ray. Cheerio.
B0073LJ61S|5.0|A very good album from a great band. Highly recommended if you are a fan of the classic Van Halen. Don't expect the syrupy ballads and pop BS of the Hagar era albums. This album is back to the rowdy roots of the band. No ballads here. Just like 1984, the lead off single, \\"Tattoo\\" was the lightest tune on this album. \\"Blood and Fire\\" is a little on the softer side. Everything else is a good deal heavier. Highly recommended! Buy this album and help put VH back at the top where they belong!
B005P3NPXG|5.0|I ordered this CD after reading a favorable review in a magazine.  My husband loves the classic R&B and I gave this to him as a gift.  He LOVES it.  He listens to it in his truck and our gameroom.  I would recommend Soul 2 to anyone that shares the love of a great talent doing some classics.  Great listening.
0240815807|5.0|Totally worth it. I learned so much with this book. Is so centered on the small studios that It's exactly what I needed. So many tips, so many easy explanation of the techniques for a great mix that I read it twice just to make sure I did not miss anything.<br />Kudos to Mr Senior. Don't miss it. You won't regret it.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|Rebecca Hamilton has a way of bringing her characters to life through vivid description, engaging dialogue, and thoughtful plots and scenarios. Her characters are about as far from \\"cardboard cutouts\\" as I have seen in a long time. The relationships she builds between her main and supporting characters really puts you into their heads.<br /><br />In The Forever Girl, we meet Sophia, who suffers from near maddening static that fills her mind constantly. When she tries to use her knowledge of magick to silence this static, something goes dreadfully wrong and not only is the static replaced by incessant voices, but she is thrown into a world that is scarier than she could have ever imagined possible. It is a world filled with original monsters and terrifying circumstances.<br /><br />In this world she meets Charles, a man who she tries desperately to be annoyed with, yet can't help but be attracted to. The relationship they share is filled with intense, emotional ups and downs which leaves the reader begging for more. The creatures in this world are imaginative and frightening, putting a fresh and original spin on many that we, as horror fans, have come to know and love over the years.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book and cannot wait to read more from this talented and engaging author. The Forever Girl is definitely a purchase that is well worth the price and will leave you craving the next installment, along with anything else this author has to offer our thirsty, horror deprived hearts.
B003L77GGK|5.0|This has been my favorite show since it came on years ago.  I like the story line and the path of the characters.  This and all seasons are a best buy

0312576463|4.0|There are obviously mixed feelings about this book. I thought it was quite an enjoyable read. Unlike many other reviewers, I found all of the characters to be compelling, complex people. Each of the characters had admirable traits and despicable ones. These characters are hardly black and white, not easily defined as good or bad.<br /><br />I think one of the reasons that I connected with this book is that I was able to identify with the characters in the modern world that I live in. Walter's description of the things that infuriated him while driving spoke to me so much that I have really started to examine why I get so upset when behind the wheel. I am trying to adjust my behavior in the real world due to a lesson that I learned from a character in a book. I think that is pretty powerful stuff.<br /><br />Most of us are flawed people, and the characters that inhabit this book each have their flaws, some bigger than others.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It is a free application.  Its fun and help your focusing and problem solving skills.  It help your concentration and allows your brain to stay healthly because you have to think fast.
B003L77GRO|4.0|We watched the first 4 seasons from the Library. Season 5 was not available, so I purchased it. Although reviews were not as favorable for season 5, I enjoyed it more than most earlier seasons. Julia Stiles is an amazing actor, and she really made this season. Season 5 progressed beyond the template of the series, opening new vistas in Dexter's personality, be they good or bad. As is usual in this series, character development is excellent, new characters are interesting and enjoyable, even if they are despicable, and the situations are intense. A great season! And now that we've watched this season, the Library has season 5.

B003UYUP58|5.0|I never thought an oncologist could write such an exciting and riveting book which is more like a thriller. A fascinating travel along the long road to find a cure for this intractable disease. But is it really a disease or something which is part of life itself?
B004LUS390|2.0|This is one of the apps I use most on my iPhone, and I couldn't be more pleased with it. The Kindle version, though, has flaws that are absolutely unacceptable ( I don't know if the more generalized Android version has the same problems.) Preference settings vanish every time I switch to another program or ebook, so I don't have crucial tools like the color picker unless I remember to activate it (by going through a series of menus) every single time I open up the program. Despite this, I've been using the program, muttering under my breath. Today, Sketchbook Pro TWICE lost images that I had put a lot of time into. Why? Apparently because I changed screens in order to restore the preferences I always use. Autosave has never failed on the iPhone version. As it stands, I can't trust the program with anything complex. I look forward to changing my tune when the bugs are fixed, but these feel like beta version type problems.

B006AX6ONI|5.0|This book is great, if you have a businessidea and have been wanting to set it out in action, this might be the book to get you off the couch! Thats what it did to me, i have been working on a project for a while, but i have been working a few hours a week, and often postponing the work. This book gave me the push and motivation to start working hard to reach my goals. I literally went from buying the book in the afternoon to working until 3 am, waking up at 7 am, going to my day-job. Getting home at 430pm and working until 3 am again. It gave me the push to stop postponing my work and realize that losing a few hours of sleep a few nights a week is a small price to pay in order to get your business and dream going!
B005EYF6NI|4.0|The classical musical genre embraces the social uphevals of the 60s, and gives us a Woman's Lib performance in the form of a lower class poor girl delegated to legalized brothels and hoodlums to earn a living.  This is not \\"Camelot\\", \\"The Music Man\\", nor even \\"Finians Rainbow\\" which also touches on social progress.  This is \\"West Side Story\\" and \\"Hair\\", minus the Jets and Jesus, with the girl having bobbed red hair striding off into the tree dotted streets of Manhatten, a kind of hopeful tragedy unto itself.<br /><br />I've seen this film numerous times growing up (albeit edited for general audience consumption), and at the time I didn't think much of it.  Reviewing it with a more adult mind I can see that the film was trying to reach the then faction of the dissatisfied female population who wanted more opportunities as opposed to relying on male companionship to give it to them.<br /><br />It's a double edged sword as a social message, but, it is a commercial film, and like all commercial films, it is a product; this one in particular being one of its time.  But for all that, the parable contained within is still applicable to those afflicted with a lack of opportunity, and who must rely on wit, guile and charm to succeed in their survival.<br /><br />This last evening I had it on in the background, and all the memorable scenes from when I, first saw it are still there, and the strangely ambiguous ending as I recalled as a boy is more of a story of hope for those who have failed to find a man of their dreams, or at least basic needs.<br /><br />It's not a film I'd readily recommend, but it is an interesting artistic window on a time when burning draft cards and bras were making headlines.
1612130607|5.0|Fifty Shades Freed by E.L. James is another stunner of a novel and a great ending to her Fifty Shades Trilogy.  Even though Chrisitan and Ana are now married, the excitement and intensity between the couple has not diminished. In fact, I think it was stepped up a notch. To add some levity to the serious issues dealt with in the novel are Ana's inner goddess and subconscious and the snarky e-mail diatribes between Christian and Ana.<br /><br />As the happy couple are enjoying their phenomenal honeymoon abroad, they still have Christian's mercurial emotional swings and possessiveness to deal with. That being said, it adds to the voracity of the on-going healing process that Christian must face in order to heal. It is Ana's love, understanding, and many compromises that continue to help him dig out of his dark emotional hole.<br /><br />While trying to deal with his inner demons, Ana has some personal battles of her own to wage. Even though it is her deepest wish to set Christian free from his personal demons, she finds herself needing to exert her independence and fight for some autonomy so that she continues to be her own person, not his possession.Adding to the angsty issues in the relationship is the antagonistic plot of the who-done-it portion of the story that began in the previous books in this trilogy. Running these two distinct plots side by side makes reading this book doubly enjoyable.<br /><br />E.L. James is a wonderful story teller. Her voice is smooth and keeps the story going like a well oiled machine. Once you start, it is hard to put Ms. James` book down.  She gives her stories eroticism, emotional poignancy, humor and peppers it all with suspense to keep her readers very entertained.<br /><br />Fifty Shades Freed is the perfect finish to the trilogy. The ONLY complaint I have is that Ana and Christian's story has come to a conclusion. I know I can revisit them when by re-reading this series; but, it is just not the same.  I lament the fact that their story has come to an end. I highly recommend this book to all romance readers; however, I really think you should read the first two books in the trilogy (Fifty Shades of Grey and Fifty Shades Darker) to get the full impact of this story. This novel will mean so much more to you as a reader when you become completely invested in these two characters.<br /><br />Happy Reading from Bona Fide Reflections!!story has come to an end.

1612130283|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey, (Fifty Shades #1) by E. L. James is a fantastic debut contemporary erotica romance novel (with some BDSM elements) that I absolutely loved. The magnetism between Christian and Ana is nothing short of phenomenal. Ms. James has a way of engaging the reader and fully investing them in an unforgettable romance that is Mr. Grey & Ms. Steele. They are a perfect foil for each other.<br /><br />Anastasia Steele must interview Christian Grey who is an entrepreneurial mogul for her school's paper because her best-friend and roommate, Kate, is stricken with the flu. So, ensues the fateful meeting of Ms. Steele and Mr. Grey. Their attraction to each other is immediate. He is cool and all smooth masculine grace while she is a bit klutzy but proves herself to be smart and competent during their interview even though she does tend to let her inner dialogue filter through to some of the questions which she would like to completely forget once she leaves his office.<br /><br />He follows up her fateful interview with him by stopping by her place of employment to see her and engage her in more conversational byplay. Their romance is not your plain vanilla variety once it gets started. His predilections in the bedroom go way beyond Ana's innocence and non-existent sexual experience - to put it mildly. He wants her; but, there are some very interesting strings that will be attached to their relationship if she chooses to participate in an affair with the sexy, enigmatic Christian Grey.<br /><br />As they get to know each other, there are some serious juxtapositions that occur on a personal level for both of them opens their eyes and their hearts to each other. He is controlling and all kinds of fifty shades of messed up; but, she recognizes the emotional turmoil in Christian and it calls to her on a level she never thought to experience. While, she has no frame of reference on which to guide herself through this tumultuous and challenging relationship, especially when he continues to hold himself at an emotional distance, she is captivated by him. The reader becomes enraptured as much as Ana in the mystery that surrounds Christian and only serves to cause the reader to fall hard for this charismatic, controlling, provocative man.<br /><br />This story is full of personal growth, heartache, and a lot of capriciousness supplied by Mr. Grey that is constantly giving Ms. Steele emotional whiplash which lays down a gauntlet of emotional challenge. Ana's inner goddess and subconscious play a comedic role in helping her deal with her Fifty Shades of Grey. Her innocence, tenacity, and sense of self is the perfect antithesis to Mr. Grey's overwhelming personality.<br /><br />Adding to the sweetness and hilarity of the story is the e-mail communication between the hero and heroine that also pulls you in to the enjoyment and magic of the story. Fifty Shades of Grey is the first book in a trilogy that starts an emotional journey and is a profoundly moving and dynamic story. The ending will leave you feeling understandably shocked, yet craving and coveting more of Ana Steele and Christian Grey. This is a prodigious debut novel that I highly recommend to all romance genre readers. The talent that is Ms. E.L. James is not to be missed.<br /><br />Happy Reading from Bona Fide Reflections!!when he continues to hold himself at an emotional distance, she is captivated by him.

1612130283|2.0|I'll preface this by saying that I didn't like Twilight for the same reasons I don't like this book: too much of a douchey, controlling man with way too many issues. I read this one and the second (just because I was curious), and frankly, I'm a little upset that I spent money on it. The sex scenes were obnoxious (he gasps? I've never met a man who gasps during sex in my life...and I really want to punch her \\"inner goddess\\" in the face), the plot was boring and pointless, and frankly, if any guy tried to tell me what to eat, what to wear, that I couldn't hang out with my friends or go to work, I would be outta there quicker than you could say \\"emotional abuse\\". It honestly just made me think that all of the people in the entire book were stupid: they knew what this crazy guy was like and let him hang around her?
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Fifty Shades Darker, Fifty Shades #2 by E.L. James is another stunner of an erotic romance book. It starts up where Fifty Shades of Grey ends. Anastasia Steele has broken up with Christian Grey because his demands were too overwhelming for her manage. Even though not much time has passed since their separation, they are both heart sick and make their way back to each other through Mr. Grey's crafty machinations. Meanwhile, fresh out of college, Ana is trying to establish her career in the publishing industry.<br /><br />The plot of this book takes Ms. Steele and, especially, Mr. Grey down a much more treacherous impassioned journey when it comes to opening up and laying bare a myriad of feelings compounding the confrontation of deep rooted emotional scars. As layers of Christian's past are stripped away, Ana and Christian grow exponentially as a couple by learning to meet each others emotional needs, further entwining their already connected hearts.<br /><br />Reinforcing the plot are two women from Christian's past who push Ana's hot buttons forcing the couple to confront the outcome of Christian's past predilections. Concurrently, Ana is having to contend with issues at work involving her boss and his questionable intentions towards her. The much needed comic relief comes in the form of Ana's inner goddess and her subconscious that help her through her emotional ups and downs. Adding to the reader's spectrum of emotion are the emails between Mr. Grey and Ms. Steele that cast poignancy and some additional humor to the story line.<br /><br />This novel also has Christian and Ana dealing with his past in a very \\"in -your- face\\" fashion that will have the reader cringing at moments from the emotional voracity, making the reader's heart ache, and bring the reader to his/her knees. E.L. James' ability to rent such feeling from the reader is extraordinary. Fifty Shades Darker is an all together different journey than it's predecessor; however, it demands no less from the reader's affections. If anything, it demands more. E.L. James offers readers a story that is unforgettable, stunning, passionate, sexy, needful, cathartic and glorious.<br /><br />Happy Reading from Bona Fide Reflections!!reader's affections.

B005LAIH3G|5.0|John Carter<br /><br />I thought it stayed pretty true to the book, but I read those in 1960.  Highly entertaining, and I was anxious to see this movie and was NOT disappointed at all.<br />Now, I need to own it.  Don't pay any attention to ANY movie reviewers, most of them have a pissy attitude anyway.<br /><br />I highly suggest, if you like science fiction, see this movie.  If you're an Edgar Rice Burroughs fan, it's a MUST SEE.
0741470314|2.0|Well,<br />I heard about this book and was looking forward to read it. It is a book written by a fan who only recently discovered MJ, lets say after his sad passing, and who clearly never met him. For longtime fans, theres nothing new in this book, because its just combination of few books, interwievs, articles and lot of YT! Mix of: JRT-The magic the madness, A.Jones-Conspiracy; J.Jackson-You are not alone; M.Jackson-Dancing the dream & Moonwalk and R.Shmuley-Tapes; Living with MJ, Tapes you were not meant to see, Oprah, T.Mesaureau, Bodyguards...<br />Reading this book, I could tell exactly which sentence is taken from where, except authors personal opinions and I felt pretty much dissapointed! It even has some mistakes...<br />Author is mainly concentrated on MJs last few years of his life, but the truth is that is little known about his life after 2005 till TII announcement. Bodyguards have some funny stories about MJ, but its on YT for a year now.<br />I would say that author discovered MJ 3 years ago, started reading and learning about him and then decided to put it all on paper (and make some money of it).<br />Newer fans will miss some informations if they don't know much about MJ and old(er) fans won't find anything new...<br /><br />I gave two stars for this book only because its writen out of love, but there are other books for new fans who wants to know the whole story about MJ (or at least big part of it).<br /><br />And I dont know why the title is \\"Defending a King-His life & legacy\\"? \\"MJs last years trough the eyes of the fan\\" would suit much better...

B003F1WM2K|5.0|I frankly know very little about Patti Smith and only enough about Robert Mapplethorpe to know his art does not interest me.  I hesitated to read this book for that reason.  I am so glad I read it anyway.  Wow- I started this book on a Wednesday and could not put it down, sneaking it in where I could, in order to finish it by Friday.  You could not plan a more perfect meeting between these two young 'kids' when they were youths in NY.  The encouragement, support and dependence they had on each other was certainly significant to both of their development as major artists of their time.  The writing is simple and tender.  The story profound and startling.  The icing on the cake was to read about NYC before it became a mall and to understand how the community of rockers and artists orbited around each other and were a real community, different than what I would imagine in today's pop music industry.  To think that Smith wrote this 20 years after Mapplethorpe died shows how he impacted her life and she elegantly depicts him with generosity and love.  This was a jewel of a book.
0765322889|3.0|I picked up this book after reading a good review on some site. I must admit that as a good introductory book into a fantasy series, this falls painfully short of great. Good characters after half the book has been read but up until that point, you constantly feel like you're floundering in a world clear only to the author. Every chapter begins with pointless and badly written poetry,no doubt the author thought this would've been good, it isn't. In the end you spend so much time trying to understand the small things in the book that you lose track of or forget to care about the plot. I didn't particularly like this first book much... But I'm buying the rest to see what happens. And to be fair it eventually becomes a good read.I just don't see the point in the author being so arrogant that he won't make his first book an easy going and good introduction into his world?
0743289692|5.0|when you read a Memoir its usually either at a middle, ending or incomplete, how this Book is  none of that. it tells a story of a strong Lady who refused to be forced into something that she wasn't comfortable with and she wanted to be free spiritually and Mentally and she had endured abuse in more ways than so many people could ever imagine.Ayaan Ali is a strong soul a true freedom fighter and this is the kind of book that i feel needs to be  required reading.  what gets taken for granted stateside and whatnot is a whole different world elsewhere and not many people know fight and struggle and dealing with Politics and just self respect of one's self with what she has had to endure.  very moving and it will break you down on emotion.
B004SYP5WC|5.0|for real adults that have real bills. it works great on my kindle fire. for you kids that want to give it a bad rating just because you don't have bills and its not a stupid game, why bother to leave any feedback at all? move on.
B0031RAOVY|1.0|We watched this with our children not realizing how sad and depressing it would be. It filled them with sadness. As for an adult perspective the movie moved slower than slow as a story that could have been completely told in about 10 minutes was painfully stretched to 90 minutes. I wish I could have back the few hours of my life I wasted watching his movie!

0062073494|5.0|I haven't read a mystery of this ilk in a long time and it was a breath of fresh air. Agatha Christie wrote this book in 1934 and it's a beaut! It stars her famous Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot. It seems to me many books and movies like 'After The Thin Man' have stolen Agatha's idea of gathering all the suspects for one final interrogation to solve the case. Can anybody do it better than Agatha, who has out-sold every published work except the Bible and Shakespeare? Maybe the only character that can challenge Hercule Poirot is Agatha's other famous sleuth, Miss Jane Marple. Since this book was written so long ago, it gives the reader the flavor of the times, such as the European attitude towards America, the style of clothing, and the reminiscence of long train trips.<br /><br />The story starts with our hero boarding the Orient Express in Aleppo, Syria, after a successful investigation for the French Army. He meets one of the directors of the company that runs the Orient train, M.Bouc. Hercule Poirot joins the other thirteen passengers, M. Bouc, a Dr. Constantine, and one conductor in the Athens-Paris Coach. And folks we are off to the races!! One of the passengers, a Mr. Ratchett, who is of vile and dubious character turns up dead on the first night of the trip. He's been stabbed twelve times in his bunk. To make matters worse, the train is now at a standstill, snowed-in by a blizzard. That means the killer is stranded on the train and posses a threat to the remaining twelve passengers on the Athens-Paris car. As you probably guessed, the director of the train, M. Bouc, engages our lovable and pyknic detective, Hercule Poirot. Let the Lumosity exercises begin! The rest of the novel is a cat-and-mouse game between the twelve passengers and Hercule. I tried to figure out who the killer was and I didn't even come close!<br /><br />It's amazing to me how Agatha Christie can make the reader visualize all seventeen people on the train in only 265 pages. I liked the way Agatha has Hercule use the director ( M. Bouc ), and the doctor ( Constantine ) as a sounding board to test his theories. He actually makes them think that they are helping him solve the mystery. This is a very sound novel and completely enjoyable. I am totally drawn- in to this series and hope to read 'Death on The Nile' in the very near future. Do yourself a favor and read A Hercule Poirot novel right now, especially this one.way Agatha has Hercule use the director ( M.

B0061S073A|4.0|Thank you for this effective, easy to use app! My 9 and 6-year-old sons saved up theirmoney and.bought Kindles. We restrict usage during the week so they can only use educational apps. The only teeny weeny problem is that I can give them access to read books, but the only book they can access is the last one they were reading; they can't choose titles from their library. If there were a way to allow selection of book titles...Other than that its awesome!!!
0743454537|5.0|I know some people really hated this books ending, but I didn't really. I wouldn't say I liked it, but I do think that it DID surprise me and I could see it happening in real life. Was it a sad ending?Yes. But I want to look at this book from all angles, and for me, the ending wasn't an issue. Most reviewers either love the book or hate it but I just liked the book. It was interesting and well-written to me and I would read it again but it was not a favorite of mine. True, the ending did not have (possible spolier alert) a tough choice made, but the ending did get me thinking as well as ir made plenty of reviewers feel SOMETHING, be it hate, disgust, sadness, ect. So, I would recommend this book to people if they want a book with a shock at the end that will envoke emotion.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|Idk what folk ore complaining about...we left the 90s a long time ago so things will never be exactly the way they were...however, the dvd series is fabulous. I loved it then & I love it now! Even my children love it & watch when I'm not even around. I'm gonna buy a seperate set for myself to hide from them just in case they scratch up the one we have. At any rate, if you're a Daria lover this will suit u fine. If you're hella anal, build a bridge (and get over it). :-)

B0067Q42BY|4.0|This game was fun and addictive. The last round was crazy fun but challenging. I liked that it had a story. Im trying to resist buying the next chapter because I cant bring myself to spend the money for it. Anyway this game played great and I had no crashes. It only took a few hours for me as I had no life at the time. Im sure you could get your monies worth because of the different modes available including the story mode. I liked being able to choose my tiles. Havent played in a while but I believe in stroy mode the tiles changed with every new location you went to iit was pretty cool. I like d the animations when using special tiles. Some I have no idea what they are there for. The game is easy. I dont recall having to replay levels just an easy relaxing good time

B002VRZEYM|5.0|I cooked a cheap roast one day and when I cut into it I KNEW it wasn't right.  I had heard about meat glue and read more about it that night.  I am convinced this is what the roast was composed of: a congealed slurry of meat pieces, blood & cellulose.  Oh it tasted fine, and it was really tender - THAT'S how I knew something wasn't right.  But since US labeling laws do not require meat packers to mention its use, I will never know for sure.  Ever since that day I have decided to know more about where our food comes from.  We rely more & more on our own garden & raise chickens.  I buy organic and unprocessed whenever possible.  This movie was profound not only in how it exposed the slurry that goes into our food but also the criminality of the corporations in bed with our government.  I will recommend this movie to everyone.

Colleen has dispelled any myths that in order to bake you've gotta use eggs and dairy. Not at all! In fact my memories of some non-vegan treats have been replaced with recipes that are more delicious, and of course more compassionate to the animals. Yet another awesome book by Colleen Patrick-Goudreau!
0812550757|1.0|It's rare that I can't make it halfway through a book, but this is one of those rare times.  This book takes us some 2,000 years after the first book.  So the amazing characters we came to know in the first book are of course now gone.  Instead we have a different culture, different characters, religion has been injected and of all things Portugese slang.  Then to top that mess off, we have words that apparently Card has made up and require an online search to gather the meaning of.  I had to just put the book down, as it felt like a mess of disorganized thought.  I really loved the first book and had put off reading it for years, and was disappointed in myself for doing so.  So read book one, skip this one unless you're a glutton for punishment.

1400069289|4.0|It is often said that we are creatures of habit, in that many of our daily activities end up being a matter of routine rather than direct deliberation (just think of your morning run-through). While this is no doubt true, author Charles Duhigg insists that this is but the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the impact that habits have on our daily lives. Indeed, in his new book `The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business' Duhigg argues that habits not only pervade our personal lives, but that they have an integral role to play in the businesses and other organizations of which we are a part, and that they are also at the heart of social movements and societies at large.<br /><br />The first part of the book focuses on the role that habits play in our personal lives. Here we learn about the habit loop consisting of cue, routine, and reward, and how the elements in this loop can be manipulated to help modify our habits (say from crashing on the couch with a bag of chips, to heading out for a run). We also learn about the power of particular habits called keystone habits (which include exercise, as well as eating together as a family) that help initiate a domino effect that touches all of the other aspects of our lives. Also, we learn about the power of belief--and the importance of social groups in helping create this belief--that stands behind successful habit transformation programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous.<br /><br />The second part of the book concentrates on how habits help shape businesses and organizations. Here we learn that the formation of habits and routines within organizations is unavoidable; what's more, that it is always best for the leadership of a group to make a deliberate effort to shape the habits of their organizations, and in a way that ensures a high degree of equality and fairness for its various members, while nonetheless making it clear who is ultimately in charge of each particular aspect of the operation. Second, we learn that keystone habits--which are at the center of our personal lives--are also pivotal when it comes to larger organizations (and how a particular keystone habit was applied to resurrect the once great but flailing American aluminum company Alcoa). We also learn about the greatest keystone habit of all: willpower, and how this habit can best be cultivated (and how companies such as Starbucks are employing these lessons to help train employees successfully). Finally, we learn about how companies such as Proctor & Gamble and Target instill habits in their customers.<br /><br />The third and final part of the book examines the importance of habits in social movements, such as the civil rights movement of the 1960's. Here we learn that movements tend to follow a three-part process. To start with, a movement tends to begin with a group of close acquaintances and friends. The movement tends to grow when these people spread it to the broader communities of which they are a part. Finally, in order to really take hold and spread, the movement must be guided forward by an effective leader who lays down new habits for the movement's adherents in a way that allows them to gain a sense of identity.<br /><br />On the negative side, the organization of the book is somewhat muddled, as there is significant overlap in the parts on individuals and organizations. Also, the section on social movements rests on a precious few examples, and therefore, the theory seems less convincing than it might otherwise be. Still, though, there are many things to be learned here and the book is well worth the read.

0553381695|5.0|I had been well and truly warned that this was going to be the kind of series that made you despair for each and every character, even the ones universally hated, but I'm not sure that any warning is sufficient.  Things fall apart quickly in this volume, following on the precipitous heels of \\"A Game of Thrones\\", and one never gets the sense that things are coming to a reasonable pause.<br /><br />In fact, one could be forgiven if they thought that their version of the book was incomplete, considering how it ends.  The downward spiral of circumstances in Westeros is clearly going to continue, and none of the characters are really left on solid footing.  Since every chapter leaves the reader in suspense in some fashion or another, and there are a ton of rotating viewpoint characters, it constantly feels like the other show is going to drop.  It's a thrilling, if exhausting, reading experience.  (And no, the chapters aren't three pages long, so the suspense is not artificially generated, as with James Patterson or Dan Brown fare.)<br /><br />One very nice touch is that the relatively simple status quo at the end of \\"A Game of Thrones\\" is rendered even more complicated by the addition of a few more potential kings.  This means that none of the characters are safe, and none of the assumptions about seats of power can be taken for granted.  Even so, one might be tempted to think that situations might play out in somewhat predictable directions, to make the complexity more palatable.  On the contrary, many situations that seemed \\"obvious\\" are quickly undercut.<br /><br />I found myself constantly rethinking my expectations and assumptions about where the story would go next.  There was only one exception, where it seemed like the apparent fate of certain characters felt a little too conveniently handled \\"off-screen\\", so to speak, to be believed.  But even then, the matter is left in doubt just long enough for me to be unsure, as other events of equal import seemed to happen in passing, as the pacing escalated.<br /><br />The end result is a book that literally will keep you up at night, as you devour as many chapters as you can psychologically stand, and then as you absorb just what has happened to your favorite characters.  And a book that will make you compulsively reach for the next volume as soon as possible.
0306801515|5.0|Absolutely a must read for anyone interested in how the world works. Gordon paints a great, timely picture of the physics and engineering of structures in such a clear, fascinating style. I have read and reread this book over the years, never get tired of it!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app works perfectly, and is a perfect solution for anyone who needs to quickly look at anything on their remote computer. I've used it without any problems to access both Macintosh and Windows computers of varying screen resolutions. Connections to and control of remote computers work beautifully.
B005EGXTHG|4.0|While I found the dialog a little stilted and the characters and background somewhat thin, my boys (aged 8 and 10) loved it. Its a great trilogy for getting kids to enjoy reading.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I've been playing this game for years on my phones and I love having it on the Kindle Fire! I'm on level 92 on my phone, so far level 16 here after only 3 days. They do give updates, though it doesn't seem like EVERY week. Add: ChezGem007 and ChezGem007L6.
1469984202|5.0|This was a great read! I could not put it down after I started it. Not many books or games ever set my imagination wild but this book sure has. I could smell that dank of silo 17. The only thing that could make storys 1-5 better is to release story 6/9. I would love to re-live it as a movie or an acted book on tape. I will buy the next Wool book in hard copy and kindle.
B00785P2QC|5.0|you guys should make one with war like this one its an awsome game I love it.every one should get this game
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Stephen King writes a most believable story.  This time traveling novel about the JFK assassination is great.  It is very believable, although we know what happened.  His descriptions and characters are well fleshed out and the outcome although worrisome, is climactic.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I saw this book cropping (excuse the pun!) up on blog after blog after book review and decided I needed to find out what all the fuss was about.<br /><br />After what felt like a very slow start, I was hooked.  This book is not for the faint-hearted or innocent.  I have heard it described as a Twilight for Adults, but it's that and more (much, much more!)...where in Twilight the main characters didn't so much as kiss, in Fifty Shades there are no holds barred...they get up to everything!  That being said though, the subject matter was handled delicately and I didn't find myself blushing too much, but then I was reading it on my [[ASIN:B004HZYA6E Kindle]] so I guess noone could tell what I was reading!!!<br /><br />The main characters are engaging (I could easily find myself falling for Mr Grey) and the whole book is well written...if I was going to say something negative about it, it would be that the ending was extremely frustrating, though I suspect that's just to get you to buy [[ASIN:1612130585 Fifty Shades Darker]]!
B004EBT5CU|2.0|I loved the first two songs on Adele's 21 album, but sadly did not like the remaining ones.  They did not measure up to the quality of the first. If I had to purchase it over again, I wouldn't!
B005FLX2WC|5.0|Beth's voice is very much like the late great Etta James.<br />Heard it on local radio as 'Album of the week'. New of Joe Bonamassa's blues guitar work from 'Crossroads' DVD (Eric Clapton).<br />Beth & Joe are a sensational combination  :)
B005VTS4EY|5.0|fun game ... some levels are easy and others are more difficult but overall a good game to kill time
006197806X|5.0|I was a little skeptical about what would happen in this book after the intense ending of the first book, but I loved it.  I loved the first book in this trilogy and this was a perfect continuation of the story. I loved the new settings, new characters, and the plot developments. So intense! I can't say too much without spoilers but I loved it and can't wait to read the final book in the trilogy!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Great when you're waiting or bored. Very fun and challenging at times. Something kids can play without breaking my device.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this.  I was really weary to read it at first, because I don't like anything that's been hyped up.  A coworker of mine recommended it and I'm glad I decided to take the plunge.  I couldn't put it down until I finished all three books and this is usually not the type of books I like to read either.
B003DZX44I|3.0|I did not like this product at all. Unless I don't understand what blu-ray is but it was mostly advertising to me even on the DVD itself. I will read the information on blu-ray and then decide if it is worth buying anymore of it is waste of money.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I had no idea what to expect from the book due to its title. I love history, but that's not the genre I want when I'm looking to get lost in a book. I didn't need to worry because I never felt like I was reading a history textbook. This is a great read. I couldn't put it down once I started.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game has awesome graphics! It looks excellent on the kindle fire! I'm not a big fan of paid apps, but this app I was willing to pay for!!!!!! :)
B000002552|4.0|but I admit some of the tracks probably should have been kept in the basement under the rocks where the crickets and grasshoppers lurk.  Just a *couple* songs.<br /><br />One thing I feel absolutely HAS to be mentioned is that if you're someone who doesn't particularly care for Dylan's harmonica work, there's actually very little of it here.  You know how Dylan plays harmonica solos at the very end of quite a few of his tracks?  Well, on the Basement Tapes... this is something else entirely.  How I do feel about that?  Well it doesn't matter to me very much, but I suppose a break from all that harmonica work is a nice change.  Another noticeable difference between the Basement Tapes and, say, Blood On the Tracks is that the lyrics are slightly less clever than usual.  Perhaps because the songs are really short for the most part.<br /><br />\\"Odds & Ends\\" is an old-fashioned, simiplistically written Dylan song with fair lyrics.  \\"Orange Juice Blues (Blues for Breakfast)\\" is basically a Band song with its slow-chugging, foot stomper blues style.  Catchy vocals too.  \\"Million Dollar Bash\\" brings back Dylan with a humorous-sounding vocal melody.  It's hard to understand the meaning behind the lyrics here.  Nice blues rock song at any rate.  \\"Yazoo Street Scandal\\" has Paul McCartney-like vocals (think \\"Helen Wheels\\").  \\"Goin' to Acapulco\\" is a fairly predictably written, simple ballad by Dylan standards.  I can almost see this song being on Dylan's masterpiece album Desire, but the songwriting isn't *quite* up to the standards of that album.  \\"Katie's Been Gone\\" is a Band song that would definitely fit in on their third album called Stage Fright- part ballad, part upbeat.  Unique song.<br /><br />\\"Lo & Behold\\" has an irresistibly catchy chorus by Dylan.  \\"Get me out of here my dear man!\\" with a touch of folk rock.  \\"Bessie Smith\\" is a Band style slow-moving and compassionate ballad.  Perhaps the verse melody is slightly overdone and loses my attention span after a coupleminutes.  \\"Clothes Line Saga\\" is a hilarious slow bluesy type song covering the subject of clothes, and the Band arrangements (the organ in particular) are pretty neatly (and oddly) utilized. \\"Apple Suckling Tree\\" is a happy clap along tune with a simple melody.  Sort of filler-ish if you ask me, but again, the organ work near the end is pretty neat and actually saves it.  I LOVE the lyrics in \\"Please Mrs. Henry\\" because it's about alcohol for one thing and I can't help but sing along to the chorus \\"Please Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Henry please!  I'm down on my knees and I ain't got a dime\\".  *Awesome* melody.  \\"Tears of Rage\\" is one of those devastating ballads that actually reminds me of the Band song \\"I Shall Be Released\\" but worse since the verse melody drags after a while.  Perhaps the song is incomplete.<br /><br />\\"Too Much of Nothing\\" is a mid-tempo blues track with unusually clean production and wishy washy Band vocals during the chorus.  I actually like it though, don't get me wrong, but my initial impression wasn't very positive.  \\"Yea! Heavy & a Bottle of Bread\\" has a familiar friendly late 60's San Francisco vibe with a happy atmosphere similar to Jefferson Airplane (especially the line \\"Take me down to California!\\")  Anyone who likes the first four Band albums will love \\"Ain't No More Cane\\" with its meaningful and fantastic vocal melody.  \\"Crash On the Levee (Down in the Flood)\\" is a slowly moving blues song with quality lyrics courtesy of Dylan.  \\"Ruben Remus\\" is a song perfect for the Band's Stage Fright album (in case it's not obvious yet, Stage Fright is my favorite Band album of the first four).  It's upbeat, melodic and playful.  Yup, it'd fit right in on Stage Fright.  \\"Tiny Montgomery\\" contains a weirdly psychedelic and serious style reminiscent of the Mama's & Papa's (thanks to the humming vocals in the background) and Dylan's laidback \\"lazy\\" vocals RULE here.<br /><br />\\"You Ain't Goin' Nowhere\\" is a beautifully sung country song and I DARE you to hate the chorus that goes \\"Oh wee, we're gonna fly, down to the easy chair\\".  I can't hate it so you can't either!  \\"Don't Ya Tell Henry\\" is a boogie rocker with piano totally reminiscent of Little Feat's \\"Dixie Chicken\\".  The few seconds in the beginning of \\"Nothing Was Delivered\\" makes me think of Otis Redding's \\"Sittin' on the Dock of the Bay\\".  Anyone else hear a similarity?  I actually don't care for \\"Nothing Was Delivered\\" because it's a forgettable ballad with derivative piano playing.  \\"Open the Door, Homer\\" is a highly melodic country rocker with lyrics pertaining to memories and good honest advice.  \\"Open the door Richard\\" is a GREAT chorus.  \\"Long Distance Operator\\" is a straight up blues song with a Band-style melody and vocal mannerisms.  Nothing very impressive.  \\"This Wheel's on Fire\\" has a verse melody that sort of resembles the one from \\"Ballad of a Thin Man\\" combined with the Band's late 60's material.  Only *slightly* though (on both counts).  Fantastic vocal melody delivering a heartful ballad is what you can expect here.  I enjoy it.<br /><br />Overall, great album with a few flaws preventing it from reaching brilliance.
B005NA3B8U|5.0|This is an awesome game. I played it when it was on the SEGA Master System. It was great back then and still is. I thought the game play would be different but, it's the same. Thank you for not changing the game. It's good to leave some things alone.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This is the best Bible app that I have found for my Fire. I purchased several e-Bibles but they do not compare to the ease and options that this has. If you are looking for Bible software to use on and offline you will not be disappointed.
B007BT0RKG|4.0|Pretty sizable download. Additional detail maps are also pretty sizable. I was a bit confused at first when it first opened to an apparently blank page, then realized it was zoomed down to blank street level. You need to zoom way out and then choose your continent/state/city. Enjoyed downloading the Paris map and looking around. Not super detailed, but it is okay.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|One of my favorite series of book.you get hooked to book instantly,I recommend everyone to get a chance to read it
B0054JZC6E|2.0|I just didn't like the games. maybe its more for kids?  I don't really know.  I don't like that you have to pass all the little games to unlock more
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love these games because not use Internet and the games are really fun to play I hope that they make another one of these so I can get and then I can get it and I hope that it is going to be free
B004N44SOI|5.0|Great follow-up by the band to the Heroin Diaries.  Great lyrics and guitars, this is a group to see going far.  Rock On Nikki!
0439023491|4.0|If you can get through the first 60 or 70 pages which is mostly backstory and Katniss acting like a girl, this really is a great book. One can't fault Ms. Collins for feeling the need to include what happened in the first book. I suppose if you were one of those people who read each book as it came out, you might even appreciate it. I on the other hand came to the Games late. After reading the Hunger Games three weeks ago, I bought the rest of the trilogy. I'm glad I mustered through those first few chapters of backstory and Katniss's romancing issues because the book finally took off and delivered a great read.
B00005NIE1|5.0|Amazing! Everything arrived in expected condition(brand new) and it sounds perfect. I love The Strokes and will definitely be buying another one of their vinyls.
B0064MT1FI|1.0|I love The Piano movie so much and this time I bought it for a dear friend for her birthday.  I ordered it on February 9th and wrapped it, waiting for her birthday.  So I had no idea that the CD was cracked, the case is in good condition.  Now I am wondering if Amazon will send me a new CD to replace it?
0385534639|5.0|I got this book expecting it to be about magic and a circus (of course), I just hoped it would be a good read. It drew me in and I could not put it down until I finished it. It is a great story and very well written. I love the time line, the characters and just everything about this book. I also appreciate that the author was able to tell a wonderful love story with out having to use sex, lust and crude language to tell it. I would recommend this book to everyone.
B004VQFQ2Q|4.0|Fantastic album, one of my all time favs, the bonus disk is great, sound quality not the best, but hey, you can't win em all, overall a great addition to the collection !
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I absolutely love.this.app. I play it all the time. based on the reviews.I hope the update thing is fixed so I wont loose all my progress ! but other than that its awesome!
B005VTS4EY|5.0|comparing all the games I have played, I think this one is the best. I really enjoy the face emotion of the blocks. so cute.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|The mahjongg layout are great and the app is beautiful. I don't necessarily think the interludes add much to the gameplay, but they don't really detract, either.
B0071QIN00|5.0|this game is great! not easy, but I was able to get all three stars on every level. 30 levels and all of them are both challenging and exciting!
0711225176|4.0|I originally got this book because I'm making a mural of Mucha in my room, but was pleasantly surprised at how much information it has in it.  The numerous pictures are gorgeous, and I love the background info I learned behind this beautiful art.
0060987464|4.0|I was pertrified of M. Manson, his style and his music, just sooo scared.  But once i read his book, all has changed.<br /><br />He is a very funny guy.  I found him to be very Smart, Bright, Erudite, and very committed and passionate Artist to his music and his world.  I respect him for his self expression and i, actually, like him now.<br /><br />As i was confused of his sexuality before (gay or bi), he is actually very heterosexual man confidently exuding masculinity. A great read!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like this app. when I play this game I have fun. there is more than one reason to get this app.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A very true to the heart story of a real person and patriot. The people that you would love to be surrounded by.<br />Highly recommended
B0054JZC6E|3.0|It is free hence 3 stars. The graphics are rudimentary. Some games are not easy to complete and thereby you are forced to play certain games to get more points to unlock others. It is a Free game and thus there are advertisements which are understandable. But for kindle fire the graphics looks very silly. It makes me feel that I am playing on a CGA monitor even-though Kindle fire has a Hi-Def Screen.<br /><br />If you are in love with arcade style game you may very well like it. I am giving 3 star as it is okay game and it is free so no complains.<br /><br />Have fun!
B0073Q0DZG|5.0|fun, unique subject matter. it's a good time! you get to see all these incredible places. jack black is so likable...steve martin and owen wilson great too.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game and [[ASIN:B006OOHYIC Quell Reflect]] both are outstanding casual puzzle games from the same developer. The game design is visually beautiful with soothing background music for calming the mind. The developer has taken considerable amount of effort in designing the games and I do see that being reflected in these two apps. What I like most in this the game play which is at your own pace and makes you think while you solve the puzzles. Beautifully done. Just relax with a warm beverage and pass time. Works beautifully on Kindle fire.<br /><br />Worth 99c - Five Stars<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B005VTS4EY|5.0|Raced my husband and my elderly mother to get to level 50.  Me on my tablet, my husband on his smart phone, and my mom on her Kindle Fire.  Talk about a fun family night activity.  Thanks for the great app.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The complete Firefly series DVD was a delightful addition to my collection.  This series never took off, but it should have.  It would be a hit if it were in production today, that's for sure.  The DVD's were shipped in appropriate packaging and arrived intact.  Well done Amazon.
B006ON41FC|4.0|Fun, but it gets annoying when you turn it on and it asks you to rate it every time. But overall I recommend Going Nuts. It has earned its four stars, :-)
B005Y423ZC|5.0|Wonderful music, glad to see more playing time here since she did clean up in the recent award show. Hope she continues.
B00170DEM8|5.0|This is one of my husband's and my favorite movies.  It's truly a classic to be enjoyed for years!  Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire worked so well together and made this a truly fun and enjoyable movie.  We watch it year round!
B007AMMHSY|5.0|A disturbing and engrossing story that leaves you thinking! A psychological movie that flips the feel-good story of human creativity on its head!
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this app it helps kill time I have it on my kindle fire and my favorite part is the zen mode!!!!!!  I would tell anyone to get this awesome app!!!!!!!!
B0058VW36U|5.0|this is a great game! yes, the updates may be a tad slow, but it is worth it all the same! I just passed all of the levels with 3 stars, very addicting, and gets challenging on some levels!
B0053KWDES|2.0|There's a reason people want headphone amps, to crank it up a bit more. Generally music sounds better when pumped through quality cans with some quality power.<br /><br />This DAC (Digital to Analog conversion) I believe, is what keeps screwing it up for Fiio. My old ZO amp sounds better than all the Fiio's, E7, E11 and E6 Fiio's. It's not trying to do anything fancy which is the reason I believe that when I crank the Fiio's they all add a hardshness and distortion to my audio. I constantly put Fiio to the test and check playing with earbuds vs earcups, Mozart vs Schubert, Gatecrasher vs M83.. Fiio sucks.<br /><br />The only thing in the end that really worked for me was to take the plunge and buy a nice head amp. I ended up with a Fostex ($600) that I do love and is nice for travel. It has a USB sync connector so iPods/iPads were extra cool and easy. But the Fostex isn't perfect either, it's Chinese which if you can, avoid. Better to get Japanese products, higher quality (there is something loose in my Fostex now!).
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Both my children, 13 and 16, loved the book.  The older is a boy and the younger a girl.  When a book can grab then both it must be fantastic!
B00005A1VH|5.0|True story of a great person. I love watching it over and over. It was recommended by WWII vet that is also very faithful.
B000PAAH3K|5.0|I loved this book. I'm going to share it with my son, who is a policeman. I always said he had a \\"sixth sense\\" about people and now I know why! Everyone should read this.
081297381X|5.0|The book makes you question the relevancy of the statistics and operational research classes you took. It stresses looking beyond the \\"sixth sigma\\" to see the large problems that may occur.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|I found out about this recording through Amazon and ordered it immediately.  It arrived as scheduled.  The recording is amazing.  I've seen Phantom 14 times when it was in the theatre and with Les Miz, it's my favorite.  The performers, the staging, the orchestra, the whole production were superb.  Because it was the 25th anniversary Sarah Brightman, Michael Crawford and a few other \\"Phantoms\\" performed.  What an unbelievable joy it was to see them all.  I absolutely recommend this and, if you didn't buy the 25th Anniversary of Les Miz, that's another must have.  Enjoy.
B007BFZGAG|4.0|Good CD, especially for a first timer. The production of this CD is amazing, great choice of beats and collaborations. I enjoyed this CD WAYYYYYY better than Drake's and I'm a huge Drake fan. Tyga has definitely made a name for himself.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I really do like this app.  It is cool app and fun to play with it.  The only problem with this app is that everytime I get into it take forever to start up.  if it wasnt for that i would of gave it 5 stars
B000FCKIFU|5.0|One of my favorite authors has done it again.  I love the excitement and the stories of the Camel Club.  I read them out of order, but found them easy to follow and very exciting.  I have enjoyed reading everyone of them.
B005K17RU0|5.0|this is a great app - now, I always. know. what the weather will be today and the next 15 days - who needs weathermen when I have this
B005VTS4EY|5.0|Wow this game is addictive! I don't normally play a lot of games but this one has kept me going. I love the simple challenges each level brings. One of my top ten recommendations to my fellow android users.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|great app!  very useful and I love how many different versions you can look at.  I find it very helpful if I'm stuck while trying to understand exactly what a verse means.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|The album Born To Die is exciting. Especially moving are the classic songs \\"Video Games\\" and \\"Blue Jeans.\\" Lana del Rey is a rising new star, truly interesting to listen to.
B004QZ9PLU|3.0|I love Nicholas Sparks, but this one was really disappointing.. I continued to read it, thinking that it would be another \\"tear jerker\\", but I knew the ending long before the end.
B000RZIGVS|5.0|I loved this series when it came out & I love it now!  Definitely better quality on DVD's with today's technology, but it's still the best!
B003L77G8I|5.0|Bones is one of the most nice shows on television, full of graceful and funny characters, good stories and action. The sixth season has all this and much more!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This trilogy was amazing.  Suzanne Collins developed extremely sympathetic characters with a very intriguing and haunting plot.  A worthy addition to the dystopian genre alongside \\"The Running Man\\" and \\"1984,\\" and an interesting critique of Western narcissism.  I found myself having a difficult time tearing myself away from all three, and upon finishing the triology, I immediately scoured the internet for a complementary novel fill the void.<br /><br />Highly recommended read (and not only for young adults)
0062082353|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my husband on Active Duty, he thoroughly enjoyed the book and couldn't put it down. I first got wind of this book on Bill O'Reilly, were Chris Kyle was speaking of his encounter with Jesse Ventura, which is in the book.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I found this app through Joyce Meyer's website. It is a great app. Easy to find scripture, daily devotionals and reading plans. I definately reccommend this app.
B002LAM7PI|4.0|Ahhh...the beauty of stop-motion animation...something that has kind of fell along the wayside for the ease of a computer animation (not trying to take the hard work out of that). I just miss the hand drawn and the claymation that seems to have been replaced. I'm an old fashion girl at heart, though I do love the beauty of CG stuff and nothing can be the special effects. Still, if you are a lover of the genius of Neil Gaiman's work, Coraline will take you on a dark adventure into a little girl's want for everything and the realization that sometimes getting it is not always best.<br /><br />Coraline is the story of a little girl that is forced to move somewhere new for her parent's work, both who ignore her and are absorbed in their own little worlds. In an effort to entertain herself, she meets Wybie, a weird boy with a stray black cat, who tells her of his grandma's sister disappearing in the same apartment as she lives now.<br /><br />Coraline laughs it off, but when she find a little door that seems to lead to another world at night, she starts believing that just maybe Wybie is right. On the other side is her life only the way she wants it with everyone catering to her every desire and totally absorbed in making her happy. The only thing that is odd about this new place is everyone except the black stray cat has buttons for eyes and the cat seems to talk. Will Caroline stay or will see she what is really going on in front of her?<br /><br />For lovers of Nightmare Before Christmas and Corspe Bride, Coraline will give you all the good fun darkeness you've enjoyed, but this is definitely not a movie for younger viewers. It is scary, has a scene that involves a fat woman and a thong, and could give nightmares rather easily. I suggest that this one can wait until they are at least ten, same as the novel that started it all. Besides that, Coraline is visually gorgeous and a definite buy on BluRay, if you have it. The clarity and 3D scenes make it stunning as well as pull you into the world that Gaiman creates.<br /><br />I would definitely give this one a 4 1/2 out of 5. Be careful what you wish for.pull you into the world that Gaiman creates.<br /><br />I would definitely give this one a 4 1/2 out of 5. Be careful what you wish for.
B004UNX1LS|4.0|i think this app is great on a Kindle Fire the only problem i have with it is that it doesn't have every single song like youtube does but its still great!
B004SYP5WC|5.0|With this simple app you can input all your monthly bills, set them to repeat, and even set reminders if you want to. I'm a busy man with a busy schedule. Come pay day life is a little bit hectic and it's hard to remember exactly WHAT needs to be paid, WHEN, and HOW MUCH. That's including keeping track of my bank balance and automatic transactions that are coming out.<br /><br />I'm sure you can do the same thing as bills reminder with a checklist but with a checklist you wouldn't have a calculation of the total expenses, organization of which bills come first, as well dated inputs. If you have 10-30+ bills like an average adult, you'll find bills reminder a great help on your android phone or kindle.<br /><br />Pros: Simple way to manage bills<br />Repeatable inputs<br />Bills organized by due date<br />Optional Reminders<br />Backup features<br />No harmful permissions<br /><br />Cons: No sync between Android devices<br /><br />I imagine the app will be more useful on a phone than a Kindle unless you carry your Kindle everywhere with you. All in all great app though. Thumbs up if you're glad the FAOTD isn't a children's game or some other horrid permission ridden spyware.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|omg this is like the best game at the market really I mean it this game is perfect its hard easy and a lot of fun
B004JK61K0|5.0|I got K-9 because the e-mail app that came with the Kindle Fire would not connect with Comcast for outgoing messages.  (Amazon tech support acknowledged this is a known problem.)  K-9 connected to Comcast and to a web-based office system (DeskNow) with no problem.  I use POP3 with Comcast and IMAP with DeskNow, and both work just like they should.<br /><br />I also have QuickOffice Pro on my Kindle Fire, so it is easy to download Microsoft Office attachments and read them.  K-9 also works well with the default Contacts app and easily autofills recipients as you start to type them.  I definitely recommend K-9.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|One of the best Blu Ray box sets out there. The box art looks amazing and simpy beautiful and the picture quality of the movies are just WOW!!! The sound quality is great as well.. The only bad part of this set is that it does not include the original theatrical versions of the original triology. Other than that this is a great product, got it as gift and loved it. A true Star Wars fan will love it.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|Not a bootleg, its just like the one they sell at wallyworld got it for my son for christmas and we all sat and watched it together christmas morning! The lion king is much shorter than i remember it!

B000JQU1VS|5.0|The adventures of Sherlock Holmes, a privet detective and an incredible reasoner, are excellently told from the eyes of James Watson, a curious doctor and Sherlocks closest friend. I found the stories to be interesting and the book generally pleasing to read. There are many quotes that tell not only the tale but of life as well. The only flaw is that it is the same basic story outline; Sherlock gets a seemingly unsolvable case, and then, against all odds figures a way to solve it.<br />Overall, I recommend this book to anyone that likes detective stories, defiantly a worthy classic.
B0011NVCSO|2.0|i think bon iver has a few really good songs on here & i generally like his melodies & overall this is a well written album, but the fact that i have a hard time picking out a single lyric just pisses me off! it's just muted mumbling at that point. not many repeat listens for me unfortunately. i really want to like it. if he enunciated better i think it would help immensely.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|love this game some r super easy then u get a total brain stumper.  fun for kids too but geared towards older kids like me....lol
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Angry Birds Seasons is really fun, but it also keeps your brain challenged because you have to think about what you are doing. I have all three versions of Angry Birds. It is fun to do. It will keep toy busy. If you are on your smart phone or Kindle Fire or even on Google Chrome, Angry Birds will defenatly keep you entertained anywhere you go. For example, at the doctors office, lazin around the house, free time at work, or any other place you can think of. I personally love angry birds seasons, but I must say again it is and can be very challenging
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I originally. only downloaded this game because it was free and I was at the hospital with nothing to do but it actually turned out to be pretty fun. played it all night long.
B000ZHCQ5U|5.0|A classic. A must-see for anyone over 20-yrs old.  Captures the Cold War in a way that history books cannot.
B004SYP5WC|5.0|i have tried 3 other aps like this, but have found them hard to use. taking way to long to set up, then to find errors when i thought i was finished with the set up. this ap is easy to enter info and set up. i found no errors, when finished. dont know where the negitive reviews are from. this one actually works. simple and free, cant beat that.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I came across the Wool Omnibus Edition simply because Amazon e-mailed me that I might be interested in it.  I usually take these lists with a grain of salt but decided to give the Wool series a try and I have enjoyed every last minute.<br /><br />The books are very well written with no grammatical errors, as other readers have noted and should be destined to be \\"science fiction\\" classics.  \\"Science fiction\\" was quoted as the books are set in what plausibly could be our very near future and are not hard core sci fi.<br /><br />I am now looking forward to reading the rest of Hugh's books and will be eagerly waiting for new instalments in the Wool series.<br /><br />Well done Hugh and thank you!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I am not normally a Stephen King reader but my book club chose this book so I went ahead. I thoroughly enjoyed it. The characters are well described and you come to know them. The historical ones are as you imagine. I was up late several nights because of this book. I had hoped for a different ending but it is probably the ending it should have. I highly recommend this to all. Thanks for listening and God Bless.
B006O5Y0SS|5.0|I'm officially in love with Owen Wilson! And I couldn't have more faith in Woody Allen's ability to consistently make fresh and fabulous films. I particularly love the dialogue in this film, and am so delighted that Midnight in Paris won an Oscar for best screenplay! Watch this for a great pick-me-up, for romantic and creative inspiration, or even to hear a few wonderfully-delivered lines of existentialist thought.
0375851569|5.0|It came in so much more faster than I thought it would! I love the way how the book is drawn. Very colorful!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I love this game so much it rocks I love angry birds so much. please please please get this game.
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|Excellent book.  Simple to read, easy to understand and put into practice. We both read it and our relationship has gotten exponentially better since.
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|I wish I hadn't taken so long to start watching this show.  It's more about the characters and less about the actual \\"cooking\\" and that's what I dig about this show.  It's a great mix of drama with some hilarious real-life comedy thrown into the mix.  I never really appreciated just how good an actor Bryan Cranston is until I started to watch this show and now I can't wait to see what else he's been in or going to be in.  Psyched for the new season to come out.  I've been blown away with every episode.  Love it!
B00785P2QC|5.0|it is amazing and very addictting you must download this it is so fun and is a great time consumer on road trips
B001W63DX2|5.0|Been a Maiden fan since the beginning and this documentary is a nice addition to my library. I noticed though that the DVD covers the early part of the tour...are we gonna be seeing a part II?? Overall, lots of info and music in one package.
B0042J6VUS|5.0|This was just what I expected. No complaints here.The price was fair and the product was simple and useful.I would recommed this product to somemone looking for a cheap, portable stand.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Defending Jacob had me reading the book any chance I could. There were some great twists and I can hardly wait for my husband to read it so we can talk about it! If you buy it, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
B0058VW36U|4.0|cut the rope is a entertaining, great game but needs some updates. has many different levels and adds on levels for free. there is no adds. children love it and over all its worth $0.49
B00004W510|5.0|On the rare chance that you have never heard this music, it's a must. The extra tracks are truly a<br />bonus. Great liner notes, too.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Surprisingly a very fun and entertaining game. Some levels are a little hard but keeps the kids occupied ..Very Pleased
B00004W50T|5.0|I would be happy when I purchase a Remastered CD if there were no Bonus tracks. But, the extra songs on this are all very good. Otherwise, I could never do this music justice with words. Essential listening.
0385737955|5.0|this book will keep you reading untill the end. In the begginging its all confusing and to many question are asked but, as you keep reading the book the awnsers are revealed and the puzzel is solved. This book will give you anticipation to turn the next page because of the needing to know what happens next. When i started getting to the end all of the awnsers are revealed to me untill something i didnt expect to happen....happened. i recomend this book to everyone who wants to read a good book.
0316098329|5.0|A great, amzing, thrilling book!! You wont be able to stop reading.  I recomended it a lot. I. Loved it
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Lots of games, but some seem impossible to do without a stylus. You have to win games in order to purchase other games, so you don't get 101 games right off the bat.
B005QUQ99K|4.0|I'm an unashamed adult collector of LEGO toys. While the Ninjago theme didn't particularly appeal to me, I do enjoy a few of the models and some of the unique elements of the sets as well as the minifigures from the previous years Ninjago theme.<br /><br />I picked this set up on whim and I'm slightly disappointed with it. A tiny ninja on a more than oversized motorcycle looks a bit ridiculous when paired together. The transforming feature wasn't all that interesting (the blades on the sides of the motorcycle move a few centimeters outwards) and the new costume design for the ninja looks too much like the power rangers.<br /><br />All that being said, I know I'm clearly not the target client for this series so I won't dock down stars. This set has everything younger male LEGO fans will love. Big wheels, a random assortment of weapons, accessories, a treasure/shrine and a hero and a bad guy. If you don't follow the show, this is enough in this set for a creative young mind to have a good time (with some imaginative violence thrown in, of course).<br /><br />For LEGO collectors and builders, there may be a few elements in this set that may of interest. There are a few red sloped pieces that you can see from the picture and technic pieces if you don't have enough of those. However, if you aren't interested at all in the theme or just by looking at the pictures of this set, this set is worth passing up.<br /><br />In summary, great for younger kids! They will have blast. Older kids and adults, pass this one up.<br /><br />As usual, check the LEGO website for the MSRP retail price before buying (especially when buying from third-party sellers) so you don't overpay. I think the retail price is a bit steep but you do get a lot of play elements that will keep a young one quite busy for a while.

B0041KKYEM|4.0|It seems that some of the reviewers on here did not even realize, or did not have the intellect to realize, that she was a schizophrenic. That is why it didn't make sense to them. Some of these reviews are completely idiotic. Go watch another moronic Adam Sandler movie if you can't handle something with a bit more depth to it... And she deserved the Oscar, no question.
B000002MNR|5.0|I snagged this CD as an afterthought when I was picking up a bunch of Dire Straits and Mark Knopfler; I thought what they hey, I like his Princess Bride music, so why not.<br /><br />But now I play it more than any other CD I bought that day (except for maybe the first Dire Straits album).  I play it when I'm flipping flashcards or studying and need music without words but don't feel like Mozart or whatever.  It's achingly beautiful, but also relaxing.  I also found out it's the perfect music for driving around and looking at autumn colors.<br /><br />Funniest thing: I can absolutely count on, if I play it and I have company, somebody is going to rave about it.  Really, I thought at one point my friends were messing with me.  But no, it's just that good, and most folks haven't heard it.<br /><br />There's not a single track I skip over.  It's great from start to finish.  Listen to the samples and if you even think you might dig it, grab it up, cuz it just gets better with repeated listens.<br /><br />Last thing:  I'm not a fan of what music started sounding like in the 1980's.  For the most part, I think radio stubbed it's toe on 1979 and didn't recover until 1990.  Too twitchy, too sappy, too keyboard-driven.  But there are a couple of places where the 1980's really did something worthy, something all its own and just as valid as the better decades.  Cyndi Lauper and Depeche Mode are a couple of acts that captured that something.  And this collection offers an avenue to something genuinely mysterious and heavy about 80's music, too.  Mark tapped into it in his own way.  Not that it's essentially an 80's sound he's capturing, but it's definitely laced with it.  And the 80's vibe it's laced with is the very good one.  Check it out.
B004N70MH2|5.0|This is an Amazing and inspiring book; Marcus Luttrell is a True Patriot and American Hero, he might not think so but I do! I bought his book after listening to him on Glenn Beck's program and wanted to know more about him. I thank God for men like him and pray for our troops every single day. To realize the sacrifices they endure while we live our Very indulgent lives, will open your eyes and make you appreciate what they do every single day.

B001VLXNLU|5.0|best series ever! i very much enjoyed them. ihope who ever reads my review gives these books a try. alot people are putting this book down but im fifteen and have alot of drama in my life and this book is a great escape to that. it was incredible i seriously couldnt put them down. i took them everywhere with me.amazing book. no one knows what there talking about except me!
1439156816|3.0|I am happy I read this, I guess that sums it up nicely. The beginning was a bit too much of his personal story for me. I wanted to get right down to the \\"on writing\\" part. However he's Stephen King so it had me interested and at times laughing. Worth the read for an aspiring author.
B006TLFIAQ|5.0|Great movie! Wasn't sure what it was going to be like because there were only 3 stars. It was awesome!  Statham is pretty good in it, but overshadowed by DeNiro who is just a BADASS throughout.  Both my girlfriend and I enjoyed this, a lot of action, and good plot that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Good stuff!
B002ZG97LK|2.0|This remake is practically the same as the original except that the acting is awful, the music is not nearly as good, most of these folks cannot dance, and...well, you get the picture.<br /><br />Why???
1612130283|1.0|In all honesty, I couldn't put the book down. I read it quicker than I've read most books and for that alone I almost gave it more than one star. The reason I settled on the one star rating is because of the content of this book. I like a naughty book as much as anyone and as a matter of fact, when a friend said \\"this book is all SEX\\" I downloaded it about 15 seconds later. Once I got into the book, it came clear to me that I was continuing to read it much for the same reasons we stare at a car crash on the side of the road. Yes, the writing was bad, but I don't care about that. Yes, the main character was annoying, but I can get past that too. But an entire book based on some guy's BDSM obsession was disturbing. I'm sure a lot of readers of this review are going to think I'm some Pollyanna who is sexually frigid, but that is not the case. I will say that after working in criminology, probation, and psychology for years and years, I found this book to be a warning for all girls out there who think that a man who wants to dominate you completely is sexy and it must mean that girl is something special. The main character struggles with this but goes along for the ride. She complains here and there and expresses her fear but never did she say \\"NO man should EVER SCARE me\\", emotionally, physically or otherwise. Agreeing to sit on the floor and not look up your partner until he gives you permission says a lot about both partners. Feeling guilty for having male friends or always being scared that you might have done something to anger your partner is abuse. And the countless references to the main male character being a stalker, is not funny. This book is an novel about a man who is a sadist and a woman who is trying to convince herself that there is nothing wrong with that. Is some of the sex erotic and sexy and hot? Yes. But if you take the consensual sex acts out of this book, it could be found in the self-help section of the bookstore as a manual for what to avoid ina relationship. It has every red flag possible for abuse and control from the control of her money, her time, her friendships, her sexuality, her clothing and what she eats. And the fact that the author thinks that is hot is just gross and shows her own lack of self-respect.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|this app is just absolutely great if you want android instead of itunes!!!!! I love it so much.....I would be lost without it
B005XOPEOU|3.0|Its a decent album but I do agree with others who say its overproduced. I could do without all the bells & whistles in exchange for good lyrics and melodies. I guess the album fits in with what's popular now but good God I am so baffled by Rihanna's presence in \\"Princess of China\\". Was she the only person who didn't have to stay home and wash her hair that day? Seriously anyone else would've been a better choice. The first 8 tracks are probably the ones I'll be listening to. The others are ...meh.
1612130607|4.0|Loved the Fifty Shades Trilogy!! Not a big fan of reading but heard the reviews on the book on the Today Show. Once I started reading, I couldn't put the book(s) down. I did start skipping over the sex parts, it got boring. Also, the Author would repeat the same things over and over again, which was aggrevating.
B003L77G8I|5.0|I love bones its the one show where you think this cannot get any better and then it does. You would think that because of how long this show has been on it would be kinda tiring and repetative (like Greys Anatomy at this point) but its not the writers are phenomenal and always keep this show interesting and fun to watch, i cannot wait to see what is in store for one of my favorite couples ever seeley and bones. i hope that these 6 years are worth the wait and they have an epic romance like fans deserve to see. Keep suprising and making us laugh cast of bones :)
1612130283|5.0|This is definitely, by far, one of those books that you cannot put down.  There is not one dull moment and I finished reading this in one day.  I just finished the second book in the series last night; kept me up until 5 in the morning!  I can't wait to read the third book and will be sad at the same time that it'll be over.  However, this will probably be something I'll enjoy reading over again!
B003HZW26U|5.0|Thoughly enjoyed this book.  Life in the eyes of a dog, very touching.  I highly recommend reading this book especially if you are a dog lover.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|really fun! I think the best thing is that the games are free. at any time you can play and win games to earn points to get to other games.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I rented this movie for myself and it was very very very good and it's a true story.  I enjoyed it so much, I bought it for my daughter who has a special companion dog \\"Benjamin\\" and I just knew she would enjoy it as much as I did.
B005C5A6C0|4.0|Machine Head have been around for quite a long time now and have seen many change-ups over the years. After returning to form with 'The Blackening' Machine Head did what no one thought possible and made a follow up album that is just as good, if not better! If you enjoyed 'The Blackening' or anything else Machine Head has done in the past ( less their poor NU METAL attempts ) you will surely enjoy this album. Pick it up!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Makes my daily devotional easier. Finding favorite passages is easy. Definitely ensures that I will read my Bible daily. Love it.
0439023513|5.0|This is one series of books that I absolutely could not predict what would happen next.  I felt glued to the pages and stayed up all night until I was done.  I was fascinated by both the physical and moral dilemas faced by the characters.  This was not a black and white/ good vs. evil story, but a complex story about the fog of war and the sacrifices that are made to gain freedom.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|I bought this movie a month ago, and it worked perfectly well (No scratches).  Also, there was no shipping problems.  It arrived just like I predicted.  I believe the 3 blu-ray discs was around 23 dollars after tax.  Can't go wrong with a purchase like this.  I am happy.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I read all three books from beginning to end. I couldn't put them down, trying to figure out what will happen next. Never a dull moment. This author took me through ever emotion with the character. At the end I was an emotional wreck! Never thought I could get lost in a book. What I loved the most is that you didn't have to read the first to follow the story.
B006UKFFE0|5.0|This book is a 'best practices' manual that synthesizes bootstrapping, customer development, lean startup and other ideas into an actionable plan.  I hope that its audience is not limited to startups.
0743457900|2.0|I don't like fiction so maybe it is no surprise that I did not really enjoy reading Le Carre's Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy.  I started reading this book as part of my fiance's book club.  The women in this book club elected to pick a book that their significant others would also enjoy. The idea was that we would all get together and this book would stimulate some interesting dialog that would stir the differences between men and women.  With that in mind, I started this book rather excited as I had read a few reviews talking about how Le Carre was \\"The premier spy novelist of his time. Perhaps of all time\\". Although I did finish this book, it was INCREDIBLY hard to follow, in part due to the British dialog and the fact that the book jumps from present tense to past tense . . a lot.  It was difficult to keep the characters developed in my mind and prioritize their importance within the context of the story.  At times there were portions of the book that brought the reader into the story to explain what was going on however most of the time I felt as if I were trying top eave's drop on a conversation not meant to be heard by outsiders. Maybe that was the intent of the book?  I can say that reading the book- did help interpret the movie and appreciate the story line. Very subtle and slow but WAY less confusing than the book.  This may be a rare example when the movie is much better than the book. Our book club discussion was very interesting mainly because the woman who reviewed the book- first described the history of the spy novel genre and then described the historical events that shaped the period of time when Le Carre wrote the book. When it came time to discuss the book itself . . . most people had little to say aside from . . this book was confusing.  The ending of the book is a little anti-climactic given the amazing spy movies that have been made in the last 10 years however those who love spy novels . . this book is probably an important read.  In closing, this book has a great idea and theme wrapped in a thick blanket of irrelevant dialog and plot point to subtle to be noticed by the average reader!his book has a great idea and theme wrapped in a thick blanket of irrelevant dialog and plot point to subtle to be noticed by the average reader!
B004SYP5WC|3.0|A good concept but I encountered some errors while creating bills.  The company should have a quality assurance person to test the app.
B004SYP5WC|4.0|Thought I was going to really love this app for all my bills until I wanted to start entering them from the 1st of the year! When I tried to enter dates starting ffrom January 2012 it wasn't allowed!! I got an error message stating that it must be a future date.  I tried entering today's date March 12, 2012 &amp; that wouldn't work either!! Grrrrrrr, what's up with that?<br /><br />I hope they fix this and it's just a bug or I will be deleting this and going back to Easy Money.  Oh I forgot to mention I'm using this on a Kindle Fire. I will give it a 5 star rating once &amp; if the due date issue gets fixed.
B005QYKE2Y|1.0|Lots of loud noise and quick movements. Just the kinds of things that monkeys and idiots enjoy. Please...for the love of God, do not make another sequel. This movie really sucked!
B0000257MA|3.0|I bought this cd as a gift from my daughter to give to her boyfriend. The cd itself was fine however the case had a big crack in it. Her boyfriend loved the cd and had no issues with it but it was quite embarrassing for her to give him a gift with a cracked case.
B0068MNO4S|5.0|Anonymous is a terrific movie about the identity of the real Shakespeare. It is factual and fascinating. It's wonderful to see the truth about the Bard finally revealed after all these centuries. A true mystery is finally solved. I've been waitng for this movie to be made for over 10 years. The evidence was always there. It was worth the wait.
0525423656|3.0|Crossed is a really great addition to the Matched trilogy, but while it may be important to the series, it leaves you wishing you would've had more. The story is completely about a journey and please don't get me wrong, it's a great journey, it really is! However, I would have loved to have more of a solid destination point to the novel.<br /><br />Let me try to explain better: Crossed is about Cassia trying to find Ky and vice versa. I was under the impression that when she found him, the story might stabilize a little, but there was just more traveling and more moving through the whole thing. It lacked a lot of action and was sort of anti-climactic. It kind of reminds me of the game, The Oregon Trail because the whole game is about surviving the journey and that's pretty much it. Just keep traveling and stay alive and that is very much how Crossed is.<br /><br />Also we, as fans of the Matched trilogy are even jipped on our obligatory mushy reunion scene with Ky and Cassia. Simply put, it doesn't really happen. So, is it a good book? Yes, but as a fan you might feel disappointed. Is it worth reading? Yes, but only if you really liked Matched. I think this book was an okay read and I don't regret it. I do believe that Reached(the next in the series) will be much more exciting from how Crossed ends, so I am looking forward to that.<br /><br />Overall, I would give it a 3 out of 5 rating, I would recommend purchasing it only to have a completed series, and I would not read it again.
B006HGXGWU|5.0|This movie really took me by surprise by being so much better than even the good reviews made it out to be.  Michael Shannon's performance is Oscar-worthy, and the story begins on a tense note and the tension increases until it becomes almost unbearable to watch.  It affected me tremendously, and Take Shelter has to be one of the most underrated films of last year.  Some people didn't like it, and I'm not sure why, but I was hypnotized by it.  A must-see in my opinion.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|The Lost Hero is a magical, mythical, and thrilling story about three demigods on a quest. There are twist at every corner and you never know what's going to happen next.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|I really enjoyed reading all of this authors books.  They are all more based on a love story so I can get into them better than others.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game. The more you play, the more games you want to unlock. I highly recommend this game.
B006ON41FC|4.0|I think it was ok but they should get more games then that one after a littel it gets boring.g
B0019N94X6|5.0|This was a great buy. It was almost 25% cheaper plus no tax and no shipping fee's. I love this movie and watch it faithfully!!
B001NLKXK2|4.0|When the book club picked this novel, I was apprehensive.  Did I want to read a book about a woman diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease?  It didn't take me very long to realize that the book dealt with much more than that.
1612130283|5.0|I loved it.  Bought the eBook through my Kindle Fire and ripped through the first book during a Friday night insomnia bout and remembering The Today show profiling it so I figured why the hell not.  I'm a young, red-blooded female and coudn't put the book down! Immediately bought book 2 & 3 and devoured those. If your into those Harlequin novels, this is it all suped upped and waaaaay better.  I'm not saying its War & Peace for crying out loud but a good, entertaining read.  Actually all 3 books were very good and just wish EL James would come out with more, perhaps some prequel books delving into Christian's sexual world and how he came to be in it.<br />I would actually love is this was made into a movie but I highly doubt you could squeeze these books into a 2 hour movie and certainly show all the graphic sex.  Would work out better as a series on paid cable like HBO a la True Blood.  Actually, I wouldn't be surprised if that came to be.<br />Like I said, you either loved it or hated it.  I'm currently re-reading them again and my husband is pleased because he benefits! ;)
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I am very satisfied and over the moon HAPPY with my copy of the Phantom of the Opera at Royal Albert Hall. Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Boggess are amazing together and capture the feelings and depth of The Phantom's and Christine's feelings. All theater lovers with enjoy this production with the visual effects and the many different sets and costumes. I've already watched my copy three times and am planning to watch it again soon!
1592332803|5.0|This book is one of the very first cookbooks I used upon becoming a vegan. Because of my mother's excellent cooking and baking skills, I have always had very high standards for the taste of my food. Particularly when it comes to baked goods--growing up, my mom was always well known among my and my siblings' friends for her gigantic (and delicious) homemade chocolate chip cookies. . Since I became a vegan a few years ago, my mother an I have made many delicious sweets from the recipes in this book's pages. Never have I heard from a single non-vegan anything but raving reviews of the resulting cookies, brownies, etc. This book is excellent for a vegan wanting to show their non-vegan friends or family members that vegan food can and DOES taste just as good (if not better) than non-vegan food. It's also a great cookbook for any baker simply wanting access to many wonderful recipes! I really cannot recommend this book highly enough. Turns out us vegans CAN have our cake and eat it too! :)
B005BOHYW2|4.0|This is, for me, one of those books to treasure. It is that wonderful combination of a great story and an enriching instruction on the meaning of flowers. It is inspiring, informative and thoroughly enjoyable. Excellent value for money.
B004SIP9U6|5.0|I am collecting all the Oscar winning movies and Shakespeare In Love was one I din't have, and now I do. It arrived in great time, in great condition, and for the right price. Thank You
B0073LWEXK|5.0|My 9 year old son and I played this game together and really enjoyed it.  We used the hints more then we needed too. We could have tried to figure out more on our own with a little more patience. -It might be better to have clues instead of clear directions for hints.
B004SIP7F8|5.0|I was happy to find The English Patient, I am collecting all the Oscar winning movies and this is one I didn't have and now I do. It arrived in great time , in great condition, and for the right price Thank you
B000JMKO3C|3.0|This book came highly recommended and I just wasn't as impressed as I thought I would be. I appreciate the message, but unless you come from a different generation (I am gen X), being a little crazy is what life is all about. I can imagine that this book would be a real eye opener to individuals whose creativity has been stifled, but I don't know that world so it was hard for me to relate to the characters in the book.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|As simple as that: Lana Del Rey couldn't get any better. The way her voice goes up and down is amazing, and all the tracks are very inspired and well written. Can't stop playing it!
B006DHAT5K|4.0|When I rented this movie I thought it was just going to be another cheesy romantic comedy. It surely is that, but it made me laugh out loud and I really loved the characters and thought they were developed quite well - maybe due to their simplicity, but I found that I didn't care how simple the characters were. I ended up buying the DVD so I could pop it in whenever I need a pick me up. Love it!
B0058VW36U|5.0|I highly reccomend this app! It only costs 50 cents, and you'll have hours of endless fun. I can't belive how there are people who don't like it. GET IT NOW!!!
B0052UYJDC|2.0|I couldn't even finish this book - the decluttering and minimizing  were too extreme for me and there wasn't even any good ideas to take away.  I want to simplify my life - but I still need to be able to enjoy living my life.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|it rocks! it is easy to find the desired verse/chapter/book :) i use it a lot.  keep up the good work!!
B004SYP5WC|4.0|Initially, I wasn't going to bother downloading this app after reading the couple of reviews complaining of errors & difficultly entering their income entries. However, because I was in need of an app to where I could at least schedule all of my many (ridiculously!) numerous bills into one simple program. I'm glad I'd ignored a couple negative reviews or I'd have missed out on a really good app.<br /><br />I was able to easily input my bills, create bill names or categories, give each bill or bill category a color for easy recognition, input the bill amounts, assign dates due, assign a reminders of my choice for days in advance. I especially like the added note feature. This allows me an unlimited amount of space to write for any bill. For example: I have one bill coming up to pay for work on repair to.my Jeep at the end of this month. But, I have questions about those repairs before I finish paying. I wrote those questions into the app so I wouldn't forget all of them by that time comes.<br /><br />To the reviewer who uninstalled this app because he had trouble inputting his income & couldn't get th reminders to work properly: First of all, you cannot create a reminder or a repeat reminder for a Category. You can only create reminders for what is WITHIN the Category. This is the reason it didn't work correctly. Also, when making a Category, you must first create a NEW category or change the existing one to make it work for you. For example: Find the original Income in the Category list and edit to \\"My Income\\" or you can simply create a New Category & label it: \\"My Income\\"or \\"Joe's Check \\":, etc.. Then sure to click \\"Save\\". Go back to the list of Categories to be sure its in the list. Then, tap on your created Income category you want to begin working with it. This is especially helpful if you live in a household like mine that has more than one income. And, ALWAYS be sure to check whether you're inputting either Payable or Receivable before saving your entire entry to your Category. I suspect this may have been why another reviewer wasn't getting his income to show up properly.<br /><br />One reviewer had mentioned this app having errors but was not specific. I, personally looked-over this entire app, using all of it's avaliable features & did not find a single error when using this it on my Kindle Fire. Because the reviewer did not give any other details, I can only guess the errors might be in part to either the owners device or User error.<br />The only negative I could find was it could use a Quarterly Expense bill pay input option but, otherwise, the app works exactly as it.is described.<br /><br />**UPDATE**  Some have mentioned not being able to input Bi-weekly reminders.  I've discovered that if you receive a bi- weekly pay check then, enter that amount for the week it is expected. Then....create a reminder One Week or 7 days prior to that expected check. The same can be done for a bi-weekly bill. I'm thinking there may also  be a way to do this for quarterly payments using this same method as well.to your Category.

B005D9MUWY|5.0|Recently transferred from my old BB after test driving an iPhone for a few months. I decided to go with an android as opposed to an iPhone and I love it, but the Swype keyboard was severely lacking imo. I forced all my BB friends onto WhatsApp to replace BBM, but felt embarrassed every time I had to address all the errors that had shown up from a lack of proofreading my words.<br /><br />SwiftKey X feels like a Blackberry keyboard to me. I've had the app for less than 30 minutes and I know I am going to be using it as my standard keyboard.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Very well done. The young cast adds life to the story. And the movie allows you to understand the story line which can be difficult to follow in it's entirety when viewing a live performance. The appearance of the Phantom is not as gruesome and hideous as we have seen in the past. This will make easier for young audiences to view without the fear of nightmares. And of course, the music is phenomenal.
B005LAIH2W|4.0|Disclaimer: This review is from the theatrical release.  As such, I cannot comment on the as yet unreleased DVD.  My review concerns the entertainment value of the film only.<br /><br />As a Burroughphile from way back, I suppose I should breathe a sigh of relief that JOHN CARTER isn't a disaster.  Despite the liberties taken with the basic storyline, there are still enough essential details remaining to say that the film at least tries to adhere to ERB's classic novel.  I believe they even get more right than wrong.  But I also think I'm on solid ground when I say that many fans of the original will feel as I did - JOHN CARTER is entertaining in its own right, but the magic of [[ASIN:0143104888 A Princess of Mars]] never made the jump to the big screen.<br /><br />Of course, that's the old fogey speaking, who fooled himself for a moment that he could go back to being ten years old for a few minutes (and judging from my fellow-movie-goers that Saturday morning, I wasn't the only one).  But as far as my eleven-year-old son was concerned, it was a great day at the movies.  And why not - JOHN CARTER is quite the spectacle.  An Earthman, mysteriously transported to Mars, who first falls in with a race of four-armed savage Green-men, and then lands smack dab in the middle of a civil war between a distinctly humanoid race of Red-men.  And a princess - there's always a princess in a Burroughs story - and I have to say that this princess, as portrayed by Lynn Collins, ebodies all the charm and beauty I've always associated with Dejah Thoris.  The rest of the screenplay does, at times, become overly complex, but in its esssentials...well, you've probably seen it played out a thousand times before - if Burroughs didn't invent it, he certainly brought it into the twentieth century.<br /><br />This twenty-first century version is a bit loaded, I think, with some social ideas that don't really belong here, but much of that I'll leave up to the individual viewer to determine because your assessment of that will likely depend on your viewpoints prior to seeing the film.  They are minor, and the ideas of the bad guys who are only interested in plundering the planet's resources as well as the anti-war sentiment may be worthwhile - but they were inserted by someone other than Burroughs, and in my opinion, unecessary in order to tell an adventure tale.<br /><br />There will - and should be - a positive reaction to this film.  Those who are drawn to Action/Adventure/Science Fantasy epics will enjoy it and I also think my fellow Burroughphiles will grudgingly give it a thumbs up too.  But I can't say that it's inspiring the same way that I felt about the book those many years ago, nor can I really see it inspiring anyone else.  Considering I thought the book was near-mystical experience at the time, it's not surprising I'd have high demands from the film.  Best to put those in your pocket, if you feel the same, and go see it with a youngster and watch it through their eyes.  That's as close as we'll ever get to being ten again - and really, that's not too bad.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Good entertaining game - even though I'm not very good at it.  It's amazing how fast the time flies when I'm playing this game - it gets addicting and you want to keep beating your score.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|i love this game!!  i would recommend to anyone who likes bakery story! you need to buy gems to get far fast, but can play without purchasing.  gems are not to pricey if you want to buy them.
B004SYP5WC|4.0|Easy to use- very handy!! Yay for it being free too!! So far, it does exactly what it's meant to. :-)
B0011UBDTK|5.0|Great complete series, has all of the episodes and it will keep the discs protected.  Excellent buy! If you love Sex In The City, you will love this complete set.
B004SYP5WC|5.0|I already bought this last year and started to use it. It is a pretty good app that is basic and simple, not too complicated to where it is a hassle just to input things. I still have the app but it became much easier to use the Pageonce and Mint apps. Using the apps where you input your credit cards and bank info is neater because you get emails that tell you when the bill is due or even when theres a big transaction charged. Like having a private secretary that says hey, heads up, you forgot to pay a bill. Plus with those I get pretty good updates as whats in my bank accounts, every transaction for up to like a month, there is almost nothing you need to go to the computer for, even paying some bills, if you have the apps sync with your bill paying companies and banks.<br /><br />But this is is good, I have to say that, if you really are against the Pageonce kind of apps and dont trust financial management apps. You can not compare it to financial management apps because this app is not what those other apps are, it is totally a differnt way to help you get bill reminders.<br /><br />Whether it is worth $2.99 can only be decided depending on how often you will use this app or soley depend on it versus used as a adjunct app to a financial management app like Pageonce of Mint. But definitely it is worth getting for free as the free app to play around with it to see if you have use for it.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I loved this app it has a calendar that reminds you of the things you have on that day its really cool great to take notes on reminders or even take notes in a class works great on kindle fire
B004LROUNG|4.0|The book was good. Started out a little slow. Over all a good read. I would recommend this book. It was a little predictable. The ending needed more closure.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|tons of fun mini games. very additive, some easy and some challenging. something else to play besides Angy birds! keep it up!
B00005OAIE|5.0|Thanks this is the disc I was looking for and its in great condition.  I love it and will play it a alot.
0802473156|5.0|I keep ordering this book to give away to friends - that's how good I think it is.  My husband used to think I was insecure because I always needed to hear someone say that I was doing a good job....turns out my love language is words of affirmation.  I just need to hear that I am loved.  Now he understands!
B000JIHP88|5.0|Used this great item for about 1 month already. Very good stuff for my baby girl. She is 3 months old now and likes this musical, mobile toy a lot! It could keep her quiet in her crib. And she bursts into laugh sometimes! So cute~
B002VPE1WK|4.0|bought my backpack for my vacation to the smokies, worked great as advertised. comfortable to wear, customizable, and durable.  would recommend this product to anyone traveling.
B004SYP5WC|5.0|So far this app is doing what it says it does. Easier for me to use instead of keeping track of my bills on a notepad. It free so try it.
1582406723|5.0|I bought this for my husband and he loved it!  Great purchase!  The comic is a lot like the tv series but different enough to keep it interesting.
B000777J2S|5.0|strange and lovely, stay away of melodrama blocks your appreciation.  For me, it is just nice to hear something different and powerful
B005GHN2GG|4.0|This book was nearly perfect for me as an easy escape book that actually had enough depth and detail to make it standout. I'm on my spring break right now at the beach--and unlike my friends I dislike spending hours in the sun simply tanning, so being able to have a couple new books on my kindle has been a must these past few days. Given the amount of books I've ploughed through in a very short time--I can safely say that this book was by far one of the best.<br /><br />It has rather unique main characters with interesting back stories and motivations as well as a slightly different take on the fantasy genre. Excellent tight writing and pacing. Above average buildup in the emotional attachment with the love story.<br /><br />All in all, a very solid home run for a quick read in the fantasy genre.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|After reading this first book of the trilogy I'm hungry for more. The emotional shifts and unexpected twists draws you right in to beg for more.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is a great app! My kids love the games. We also like the varitey! You cant go wrong with all the choices.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I just love this game it is soo amazing I play it everyday there is nothing wrong with it on my kindle fire my fad game by far!!!
0547424779|5.0|My kid had to read it for school. The book is hard cover and illustrated. I thought it was a real neat edition and my kid liked it as well.
0142419400|4.0|I nervously approached this book.  I checked this book out from the library a number of times and repeatedly downloaded it to my iphone from overdrive, only to delete it again.  The reason for my trepidation is the range of reviews from my friends for this book.  Many liked it, some loved it and a few did not like it at all.  Then the subject appears to be almost entirely romance, chic-lit and young adult driven.  While I enjoy some romance and some young adult, these are not my preferred genres unless the driving force of the story is meaty and strong.  I tend not to be a fan of chic-lit.  Okay, well this story is thick with a meaty story, the characters are well-developed and I ended up loving it.  I listened to the audio version; the narrator has the French, British and American down.  I highly recommend the audio version.<br /><br />The story in structure is a romance.  American girl of a divorced family is sent to a boarding school in Paris that caters to Americans; she meets a French, British, American guy (yes that is all one person) with crooked teeth and shorter than her and falls in love.  The story could have been simply and sappy.  But it is more than just that.<br /><br />Anna, that is the name of the young American girl, does not want to move to Paris, she does not want to leave her friends and she does not want to be in boarding school.  The beginning of the story deals with Anna learning to adapt, forcing to herself to stretch herself and abandoning her ideas of what a foreign country is like.  Much of it is done in a pretty funny self-effacing fashion.  Anna comes to Paris with many preconceptions and she finds most of these being challenged and shattered.<br /><br />Like many teenagers Anna has a complicated relationship with her parents, with her friends at home in the US and her new friends in Paris.  There is a symmetry of Anna wronging people and her being wronged, I do not want to spoil it for potential readers (or listeners!) but the analogyis not lost and Anna; it is an eye opening experience.  In the end, this is a story of a young girl growing up, dealing with family and friend issues and learning that there is more to being in a relationship than just falling in love.  It is a sweet romance that contains many little pearls of wisdom.<br /><br />Some of my favorite quotes:<br /><br />\\"How strange, how I could wish for home for so long, only to come back and find it gone.\\"<br /><br />\\"Life moves on, changes our heart - changes our home.\\"<br /><br />\\"Is it possible for home to be a person and not a place?\\"<br /><br />\\"This is home.  The two of us.\\"<br /><br />\\"It saddens me how relieved I feel to be going back to France.\\"<br /><br />\\"How could I ever believe for a moment that I wasn't in love with him?\\"<br /><br />\\"The more you know who you are and what you want, the less you let things upset you.\\"
B003L77G8I|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone the characters are fantastic.  The are very convincing and believable not only funny but witty I gave it five stars
