B0085A9HXS|5.0|I tend to be long-winded in my reviews, so I'll try to keep this one simple: this movie is great.<br /><br />It's best to judge movies on what they aspire to. Some might watch this film and wish there were more complex characters, snappier dialogue, a more intriguing plot line. The rest of you will be spending most of your time with your mouth open in awe.<br /><br />This film wants to be only one thing: an example of high-octane, perfectly choreographed mayhem and violence. In the first five minutes, the audience is treated to a tongue-in-cheek dose of highly concentrated exposition as one of the main characters explains the plot to his brothers-in-arms. A van full of heavily armed police officers have been tasked with invading an apartment building that is wired, protected, and run by a notorious gang leader. The building is filled with criminals, deviants, and various other lowlifes who, with machine guns and machetes in hand, will stop at nothing to bring down the invading presence of the law. Will the cops make it to the top and bag the End Boss? Or will they find themselves painting the walls by the day's end?<br /><br />There are a few requisite twists in the story, but they are nothing compared to the number of spins and moves made by both the camera work and the martial artists that flip and flurry through each scene. The technical prowess of the movie is astonishing, especially considering its relatively small budget, and I more than once found myself wondering how many people were actually harmed during the making of the film. I know that special effects these days can do incredible things, but a movie like this makes you wonder if the effects are less special than the talented men they have doing their deadly dances up and down the halls and stairwells of this grim crime den.<br /><br />It's always sad when a movie with high goals doesn't have the steam to reach them. It's also disappointing when a movie sets low goals and meanders toward them apathetically. This film sets the bar for action films, and then it spirals and pirouettes all over the bar like an expert gymnast. If you like action movies at all, if you don't mind dialogue and plotting taking a backseat to visuals, and if you are a fan of the artistry of the human body in motion, bring a bag of popcorn and a lust for blood, and this movie will not let you down.lly.

B0076WFTS8|5.0|As you've no doubt already guessed from the avalanche of five-star reviews this Dr. Feelgood retrospective has already received - \\"All Through The City\\" is frankly a bit of a box set barnstormer. Covering the Wilko Johnson/Lee Brilleaux/John Sparks/Big Figure years - it features 4 full album's worth and a large haul of previously unreleased studio outtakes and live cuts from the time. There's even a lengthy DVD that in itself would make a superb stand-alone release. And it's just dropped in price too. Here are the finite details...<br /><br />Released 16 April 2012 in the UK - and taking its title from a track on their debut LP - \\"All Through The City (With Wilko 1974-1977)\\" is a 3CD + 1DVD box set on EMI 5099955980524 and breaks down as follows:<br /><br />Disc 1 (79:11 minutes):<br />Tracks 1 to 13 are their debut album \\"Down By The Jetty\\" - released in the UK in January 1975 on United Artists UAS 29717<br />Tracks 14 to 24 are their 2nd album \\"Malpractice\\" - released in the UK in October 1975 on United Artists UAS 29880<br /><br />Disc 2 (73:27 minutes):<br />Tracks 1 to 13 are their 3rd album - the live set \\"Stupidity\\" - released in the UK in September 1976 on United Artists UAS 29990<br />Tracks 14 to 23 are their 4th album \\"Sneakin' Suspicion\\" (and last with original guitarist Wilko Johnson) - released in the UK in May 1977 on United Artists UAS 30075<br /><br />Disc 3 (72:41 minutes):<br />Tracks 1 to 13 and 18 to 20 are PREVIOUSLY UNRELEASED<br />Track 14 is \\"(Get Your Kicks On) Route 66\\" and is the non-album B-side of their 1st UK 7\\" single \\"Roxette\\" released November 1974 on United Artists UP 35760<br />Tracks 15, 16 and 17 are \\"I'm A Hog For You Baby\\", \\"Stupidity\\" and \\"She Said Alright\\" and are all album outakes from the \\"Down By The Jetty\\" sessions.<br />They were first issued on the May 2006 2CD 'Collector's Edition' of \\"Down By The Jetty\\"<br />Track 21 is \\"Keep It Out Of Sight (Live)\\" and is a non-album B-side of their 4th UK 7\\" single \\"Roxette (Live)\\" released October 1976 on United Artists UP 36171<br />Original copies of the live set \\"Stupidity\\" came with a free collector's 7\\" single [FEEL 1] - two extra live tracks - \\"Riot In Cell Block No.9\\" b/w \\"Johnny B. Goode\\".<br />They are Tracks 22 and 23 on Disc 3.<br /><br />NOTES - EXCLUSIONS - INCLUSIONS:<br />Even though the catalogue number for \\"Down By The Jetty\\" uses the UA code for Stereo (UAS) - the album was famously recorded and released in MONO - and that MONO remaster is what's included on this box set (the 2006 version). The 'STEREO' mix is on the 2CD \\"Down By The Jetty - Collector's Edition\\" released in June 2006 - both versions remastered like this box set by PETER MEW at Abbey Road Studios.<br /><br />Track 13 on Disc 1 is a duo of cover versions \\"Bonie Moronie/Tequila\\" and was recorded live in London's Dingwalls in July 1974. Six more tracks from that concert are on Disc 2 of the 'Collector's Edition' of \\"Down By The Jetty\\" and are NOT on this box set.<br /><br />The only officially released track from the period that is NOT on here is \\"I'm A Man (Live)\\" - it was the non-album B-side to \\"Back In The Night\\" - their 3rd UK 7\\" single released September 1975 on United Artists UP 35857. Its exclusion here is probably an error. If you want the track (along with many other non-album B-sides) - it's on the \\"Singled Out\\" 3CD set issued by EMI UK in 2001.<br /><br />\\"Malpractice\\", \\"Stupidity\\" and \\"Sneakin' Suspicion\\" have all been available before on CD on Grand Records in the Nineties - but this 2012 box set offers properly remastered versions of them for the first time.<br /><br />PACKAGING:<br />Wilko Johnson had always adored Johnny Kidd & The Pirates and especially their guitar player Mick Green - and tucked away on the B-side of their 1964 hit \\"Always & Forever\\" on HMV Records POP 1269 was an obscure cover version of a Piano Red song from 1962 on Okeh Records called \\"Doctor Feelgood\\" (Red's group was actually called Dr. Feelgood & The Interns). Wilko chose this apt name for his new rockin' band from Canvey Island in Essex - and a kick ass British Rhythm 'n' Blues legend was born. I mention all of this because the single is pictured on Page 3 of the superb booklet centred in the hardback pack - along with interviews with Wilko (December 2011), liner notes by HUGO WILLIAMS, discography details that picture the albums, comic book strips, trade adverts, 7\\" singles on United Artists, NME and Melody Maker reviews and all the usual memorabilia associated with a retrospective like this.<br /><br />A very, very smart move is the inclusion of a non-region-coded 23-track DVD (22 songs and 1 interview). Recorded in England (20 cuts from 1974) and Finland (2 cuts from 1975) - the Concert/TV appearances show the full-on thrill of a Dr. Feelgood live show in their prime. They were little short of sensational and regularly annihilated most other bands in their path. Their manic no-nonsense fast and furious songs were also beloved by Rock 'n' Rollers and even pre-dated Punk by two years. I can't stress enough how the DVD adds so much to the 3CDs of rocking mania - remastered to perfection by PETER MEW at Abbey Road.<br /><br />MUSIC:<br />I know people rave about the debut with \\"She Does It Right\\", \\"Roxette\\" and so many more (and quite rightly so)  - but for me the follow-up \\"Malpractice\\" is the absolute balls too. I wore out the 2nd track \\"Going Back Home\\" on my original vinyl copy. Co-written with Wilko's guitar hero and mentor Mick Green - it has the most fantastic Lee Brilleaux harmonica solo. I also love the Bo Diddley cover \\"I Can Tell\\" and their menacing version of Bobby Parker's \\"Watch Your Step\\". Original gems include \\"Another Man\\", the sleazy \\"Don't Let Your Daddy Know\\" and the chugging \\"Because You're Mine\\" (co-written with Big Figure and Nick Lowe). The remastered sound too - what a punch. Love it...<br /><br />It all came to a frenzied head on the live \\"Stupidity\\" set when the British public fell completely for their charms and put it on the Number 1 spot in October 1976. Again - I'd forgotten how good it is - frantic - urgent - \\"Walking The Dog\\" and \\"I'm A Hog For You Baby\\" sounding so exciting and huge. Following that pinnacle was always going to be difficult and I remember at the time 1977's \\"Sneakin' Suspicion\\" was met with disappointment - like the band was threading water - and their sound was now limiting instead of being fresh. But relistening to the cracking title track (the only single off the album), \\"Walking On The Edge\\" and especially what should have been the follow up single \\"Paradise\\" (all Wilko originals) - they're fantastic (lyrics above). I also so dig their take on the Eddie Fontaine hit \\"Nothing Shaking (But The Leaves On The Trees)\\" with Lee's harmonica tearing through your speakers. The Lew Lewis cover \\"Lucky Seven\\" and the Willie Dixon/Howlin' Wolf take on \\"You'll Be Mine\\" are great fun too.<br /><br />UNRELEASED:<br />I had expected the unreleased stuff on Disc 3 to be workmanlike - and some of it is - but there are shockingly good studio outtakes that will get fans animated in the trouser area. It opens with a rough and ready take on Piano Red's \\"Dr. Feelgood\\" which is very good - but it ups a whole different notch with \\"Everybody's Carrying A Gun\\", \\"I'm A Hog For You Baby\\" and \\"Time And The Devil\\" studio recordings from January and August 1976. They're brill. Less successful is a weedy demo of \\"Sneakin' Suspicion\\" and a limp instrumental called \\"Malamut\\" which features Mick Green on guitar. Better by far is a cover of Alvin Johnson's \\"Casting My Spell On You\\" which is pure Wilko Feelgoods - it's brilliant. The crudely recorded cover of Chuck Berry's \\"I'm Talking About You\\" is good too with a great chucking beat and again they hit you with another nugget - a properly rocking version of \\"My Girl Josephine\\" by Fats Domino. The live stuff is very much in the vein of \\"Stupidity\\". Very tasty indeed...<br /><br />To sum up - I've loved working through this sonic blast - this memory fest - and now at a bargain price of twenty-eight pounds new - it's time to don the sharp suit music lovers and do the leg-splits boogie. In fact mention Dr. Feelgood to those who saw the band in their prime and a manic grin will fill their wrinkled visage that no cigarette-smoking scalpel-wielding surgeon will be able to remove.<br /><br />On a more personal note - I once glimpsed Lee Brilleaux in 1989 clacking his way down Berwick Street in his steel-heeled leather shoes - looking like a cross between Arthur Daley and a man ready to blow a demonically possessed harmonica no matter what the cost. I wished I'd stopped him, shook his hand and just said thanks. Well this is for you Lee - Wilko - and all the boys in the band.<br /><br />Bootiful my son and then some...harms and put it on the Number 1 spot in October 1976.

B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I think it's entertaining...but not addicting. To tell the truth- it's boring after awhile. I like games like Quell. But sure...I'd reccomend it.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|It's a well written porn novel.It makes for interesting reading.It had humor and some suspends,and it happened in the Pacific  Northwest.
B007H9B8FS|5.0|I cannot stop listening to this album.  It has been a long time coming and it feels like the entire band is in top form! : )
B007SGM084|4.0|The books are well-written and thought-provoking.  It is more than just a love story or mommy porn.  The depth of the characters for such an easy read is great!
B0019IB0II|4.0|Besides being a fascinating account of one person's stroke and recovery, this book has given me a lot to think about.  Some things I've sensed but never really knew to be true.  Like the fact that our brain neurons do not die or get replaced like other cells in our body and this \\"partially accounts for why we feel pretty much the same on the inside at the age of 10 as we do at age 30 or 77.\\"  Other revelations totally surprised me like the fact that the physiological and biochemical reactions to events in our life last for 90 seconds.  Beyond that we're re-playing the emotion in our left hemisphere - and we have a choice as to whether or not we do that.<br /><br />The extent that she insists that we can take charge of what goes on in our brains astounds me, but I love this statement:  I view the garden in my mind as a sacred patch of cosmic real estate that the universe has entrusted me to tend over the years of my lifetime.
B003DT194G|5.0|This is an excellent movie with Fonda as never seen before a role that cast him in a totally out of his usual type role. not only entertaining but has a good story.
B007ZRZF8I|1.0|I am so glad that I read the reviews and the description before I got this game!  there is no easy is get this now.
B004132HZS|5.0|I didn't think I would like another person playing Sherlock Holmes like Jeremy Brett, but Benedict Cumberbatch is excellent and so is his side kick Dr. Watson, Martin Freeman.  This version is brought up to date but is still just as much fun and intelligent.
B007L96SI6|5.0|Although I liked Haley on Idol was wasn't sure how good the CME would be.  I could not be happier that I purchased it!!!!  Her unique style is totally captured and the cuts could not be more perfect for her voice.  Her sound is so captivating that you just melt into listening.  Looking forward to her next CD already.
1439152756|5.0|This book is a must read for anyone dealing with someone with Alzheimer's.  My husband was diagnosed about 2 years ago and Still Alice has been my handbook for dealing with this disease.  The book is an easy ready, yet supplies a much needed insight into the brain of someone going through this nightmare.  I have bought several copies of the book and have given them to family and friends to help them understand and cope with this illness.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Although this book is not a sophisticated piece of literature, it is addictive and hard to step away from. All three must be read!
B006ZCWTXS|5.0|Unfortunately, I did not watch the 2010 season of X Factor when she was on. I did not know who she was at the time but her name would occasionally pop in every now and then in an article about One Direction. I thought \\"What the heck, I'll check her out.\\" I looked up her audution on Youtube, became blown away, and bought her album the next day when it was released. What an amazing, soulful and rich voice she has. My ears are literally drowning in ecstasy. \\"Teach Me How To Be Loved\\" and \\"FairyTale\\" are favorites but then again every song is.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|really fun. hopefully it doesn't become uncompatable like last time. fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun funnfun fun fun fun
B00845PV16|1.0|When you compare this movie to other comic book movies, this one does not even come close. The first Ghost Rider movie I thought was okay. However, after just the opening scenes of this movie I knew it was not going to be good. Then after the first 30 minutes I thought are you kidding? The graphics were terrible. And the way the movie flowed reminded me of that horrible Hulk movie in 2003. It just does not have the right feel. This is not worth the rental and you can never get your time or money back from a terrible movie. Just Pass!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I downloaded it because I love a variety of games and found my kids wanting to play it even more than me. I have to divide out timeframes just to get a turn at it. great game!
006197806X|4.0|I can see that I may be in the minority here, but I liked \\"Pandeomium\\" better than \\"Delirium.\\" (And not only for the male lead...) In many ways \\"Pandemonium\\" is completely different from the first novel \\"Delirium.\\" In the first novel, Oliver spent the bulk of the novel laying the groundwork of the world. Even though there were brilliant moments there, I was bored through most of the first 200 pages. Delirium was a slow (but steady!) burn, which gradually became a boil in its passion by the end(much like Lena's own journey.) In \\"Pandemonium\\" it's more like a match to gasoline. I was pulled in directly with Lena's new life as an Invalid living with other survivors. Somehow this book captured more of the intensity especially in the \\"then\\" scenes, which showed her life as a new invalid with an experience group. I found those scenes really inspiring. In the \\"now\\" chapters we then can see the results of her journey there without becoming too monotonous with the \\"then\\" scenes.<br /><br />Even with this huge change, I adored this novel. I knew from \\"Delirium\\" that Oliver could write and world-build very well, but \\"Pandemonium\\" solidified her as a YA novelist. I loved the excitement and action she put into this novel. Lena grows immensely with this one. I think for some it's a little too quick, but I appreciated that a lot happened off screen with the \\"then\\" chapters. Lena is a serious BA in this. She is so different from her scared and apprehensive self in the first one, which I don't think I would've liked as much. I just loved her spirit in this one. Her strength and growth was awesome to see, as shown by Oliver's more action-oriented plot. Also, Oliver's writing is still superb, if a little lengthy in descriptors at times. Oliver knows her audience and plays it well as a classic of the YA genre, yet that's also where it fails...<br /><br />Even with all this praise, I just cannot give it 5 stars. In many ways it falls into the trap of the YA trope that is going one rightnow, where it was just so similar to others out there. (ie \\"The Hunger Games,\\" \\"Divergent\\") She took few risks to be different. This book was predictable to the extreme, especially the last page. And again, she sets up the third book with a trite ending that I really disliked, and again the girl will have romantic complications to come.<br /><br />Yet, I cannot dislike the book. It's strange, but her writing just does a brilliant job of creating another world inhabited with realistic characters and exciting plots. It's a quick read, but a wonderful one that I recommend to any one loving all the dystopian novels right now. In many ways I'm torn over my (shocking) joy I read in this, when by all accounts I should have been bored with these tropes by now. It just didn't happen, and surprisingly, I  enjoyed this one better than \\"Delirium.\\" Oliver appears to have a plan with this trilogy and I will be checking out the last one.
B0086700CM|5.0|great game...and it's free! I do think you should be able to choose a female character without having to earn 10000 coins.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game quickly became a real favorite. Works great on the kindle fire. Personally haven't noticed a lag...just my own missteps. The graphics are quite good and I have not found it necessary at all to get more coins. If you play it enough, you'll have plenty of coins. Great job by the developers...
B007V2UGPE|1.0|I had 28 of the glu coins saved and then just beat level 40 only to find out I have zero glu credits. Game will be a one star u,!
B0059XTV4Y|1.0|Awful allegory story line so you don't get that much Duke and Duchess.  Best shots are in the trailer.  Tacky at best
B0070NSPCU|5.0|First time i've felt strongly enough to write a review, but this story, and the quality of execution, commands a 5 star review.  I'll leave it to others to summarize details on the story, but of you enjoy detailed world building, characters with depth, action that rings true and quality writing i'll add my voice to the others that you will love this one.  One of the best I've read in years.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it is amazzing. the best ever some game s suck but not bad. so get or not get. its up  to you
0446571415|5.0|This is the first book by Mr. Baldacci that I have read, and now that I have finished it I wonder what took me so long to get one of his works. It's a book simply packed with action, and a plot that continues to draw the reader along.<br /><br /> I understand that the protagonist, Oliver Stone, has been the subject of other books by this author, and having come to the series very late, I don't know much about his back story, or why there are certain references to people and places that meant absolutely nothing to me. That is not the author's fault, of course, but mine for not having read his other, previously published, books. This gap in my knowledge only made getting into the plot line a bit more difficult for me, but once in I was hooked!<br /><br /> Something happens on every page, and the chapters are short enough that a reader can put the book down after only a few pages, and get back to it later. That, of course, I found almost impossible to do, for I wanted to keep reading and discover what's really happening in the plot. There are a lot of red herrings scattered about, not only to confuse the reader, but also the main characters who are trying to discover those behind a very dangerous shooting and bombing in Lafayette Park, just across the street from the White House.<br /><br /> Page after page goes by with relentless action and danger for the characters, who are extremely well drawn. It you, like me, haven't read Mr. Baldacci before, I sincerely suggest that you get one of his books, perhaps an earlier one, so that when you read this one you won't have my confusion. If this is the one you read, without the others, I know that you will enjoy it as much as I did.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Great story! Quick read, love the plot. The characters were easy to relate to. Great detail in their personalities, so they felt real. Would highly recommend to friends.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is the one. the cool,  new,  awesome,  game. I really really really really really really really really really really totally regimens it
B0086700CM|5.0|I rimed this game for all ages. This game is the best game I've ever played.  I first got in to it no my friends ipad then it all cam from there but its not all about my. Its about this game. But inyway I've never had problems and I hope my words r good enough for u.
B004TJ1H3C|2.0|Nope, we humans aren't the 5th Race, after all. Perhaps race 10^5.<br />Science fiction without wonder is simply television. Science fiction that dwells on who is smarter than whom is infuriating.<br />I understand the underlighting. It saved on sets because it obviated detail.<br />But the cheesy user interface? A race capable of designing such a ship would not use a button-driven UI or the analog devices.<br />Neither would the have industrial doors that clanked.<br />In Stargate, everybody and their Asgard cousin had cloaking devices, yet Destiny's designers didn't.<br />In battles, Destiny had to be turned to aim its primary weapons.<br />In combat, the weapons were controlled by humans, not by much-faster AI.<br />There was no device that synthesized food, water, and fuel from elements.<br />The show lacked imagination that elicited awe. I can think of nothing novel. Not the aliens. Not the lesbianism. Not the de rigueur civilian-versus-military cliches. Not the tedious marital spats. Not the aliens, who were bisymmetric, as usual.<br />SGU reminded me of a WWII submarine movie. Sweaty and melodramatic.<br />Stargate deserved a better Destiny.<br />Yet as much as I disliked the series when it aired, I now miss it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|get this game it's awesomely awesome,Thar's an awesome. tank game and shooting games and tons more.I love this awesome game.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is endless fun. it is so addictive. it goes on and on! I love this game. my whole family is stuck on it.
B007SGM084|5.0|First of all, an address to the critics: I believe this is a book you should not read with your head but feel with your heart. You should not be reading this for great literature or an amazing all-new inspirational story. You should be reading this as entertainment, and as an escape from your life, which is probably just about as repetitive and boring as you are calling these books.<br /><br />I loved these books, all three, each one more than the last. The thing they did best was to make me feel. I got emotionally involved in the story and with the characters to where I was hanging on every word on every page. I laughed, I cried, I felt angry, I felt happy, I felt sorry, I felt scared, I felt love, I felt lust. Any book that can thoroughly occupy my mind and entertain me to my core gets five stars from me.<br /><br />Stop criticizing, start reading. Feel the story.<br /><br />A word to the author: There was a teaser at the end of that book, and if you choose to write in that vain (i.e. the same story but in Christian's pov) I will buy it. I would love to read the story again, and plan to, but what a clever and delicious twist to get to read it from another character's mind! Wonderful idea, hope to see that on my Kindle soon!<br /><br />Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to find my own Christian Grey...
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|very cool game and very good stadgty game in my opinion I love the logic in this to its in my top 10
1594203334|1.0|The true subtitle of this book should be \\"One New York mother discovers the wisdom of Parisian parenting.\\"<br />The author depicts herself as an ingenue- sort of a wide-eyed helpless, anxiety and guilt filled first-time mother (at the beginning of the book) Through many anecdotes, she establishes that this is default American, or as she further generalizes, Angolphonic parenting.  As the book progresses (and she gains her footing as a mother of three) she begins to employ affected French parenting wisdom and viola- five years later her children are well behaved and more independent as they sit together in a seaside restaurant on holiday. Generalizations abound. This book could have been consolidated into a very nice article for Marie Claire.
B002S0OBMS|1.0|How could it live up to the original?  It can't.  Webber calls it a stand alone piece...that just happens to have the same characters ten years after the original show.<br /><br />This is one soundtrack that I've cast aside along with The Pirate Queen.  Only listening to it when I need a laugh at its absurdity.  Yes -- Christine spent a night of passion with the father figure murderer and had a child...LOL.<br /><br />Saving grace is the beautiful Australian production available on video...beautiful to look at, excellent cast and production crew.  Bad musical.
B000L53D4O|5.0|We got this as a hand me down when my son was 8 months old. He really got into it at 9 months. Now at 11 months it is his favorite toy and has taught him how to walk. He loves walking up and down the sidewalk and all over the house with his walker! A great toy indeed!
B004J4X73K|5.0|Unlike many of the readers of this series, I've enjoyed all of Flewelling's stories.  While they may not have all had the same setting or pace as Luck in the Shadows, they have all done a wonderful job at delving not only into this author's world, but also the relationship between Seregil and Alec.<br /><br />All that being said, Casket of Souls returns the readers to the familiar setting and pace of the first book.  We are once again swept up by political intrigue and sinister plots.  While there may not be as much development in the romantic relationship between Seregil and Alec as I like, it seems that Flewelling heard the cries of her readers from her other books that they wanted more action.<br /><br />Whether you have always been hooked, or you lost interest after the first few stories, this book is a definite read in the Nightrunner universe.

B0083SBMBM|5.0|I went to see this movie with minor reservations. I was blown away. The inevitable conflict between new members was well played, but when they kicked into gear they became a great team. What surprised me about the movie was how funny it was. I have never liked the Hulk. Not in comic books, not in movies, nothing. He wasn't a superhero to me, he was a monster. However, in this movie he became one of my favorite characters and ends up with perhaps the funniest scene in the movie. I liked the movie so much the first time I went again to see it in 3-D. EVEN BETTER! And now, of course, I look forward to the much anticipated sequel...
B00003CX5P|1.0|The fact Natalie Portman was cast for this movie tells you right off the bat, you're in for a complete suck fest.  She evern managed to ruin Black Swan....a movie that *could* have been awesome had she not been included.  This is the worst movie EVER MADE!
B001RCD2DW|5.0|I won't talk about how great these head phones are (their pretty great by the way) but ill dive a bit into the problems with it.<br /><br />First of is the comfort. The most hated thing about these headphones are the deep ridges that line the leather strap. I've had these on for several hours now, and the ridges don't bother me at all but I can tell how they can be very annoying. I have a \\"regular\\" sized head and the ridges BARELY touch the top of my head. although you have to take into account that my hair is always kept very low. if you have a lot of hair, then the ridges can push down, compacting your hair and adding a level of discomfort. even if your hair is low, if you wear these with the strap firmly on your head, after a while you will begin to feel the ridges. I wear them so the strap just touches my head and since the headphone cup is so large, you can still hear the music great whether the headphones are tight on your head or lose. that brings up a different problem however. if you wear these loose, prepare to have them flying all over the place when you move (or bob your head). since the ridge is the only thing touching your head, they move around relatively freely when you move, but not so much that they fall out of position. you can shake your head vigorously and they will stay on (but only just).<br /><br />Another problem people find is the size. these things are humongous, in every sense. they are really eye catching and due to their size, if you walk around prepare to receive stares. they are the exact opposite of compact so prepare to not take them anywhere you'll have to store them. if the size isn't a problem and you don't care about getting a few looks, then you can wear these out.<br /><br />Quickly, ill say that these are not bass heavy headphones. They don't rumble like an N64 controller, so if you that's what you want, then buy Beats or something like it.<br /><br />The final problem is you need power to really push these headphones. don'tplug it into your ipod and expect to be blown away, cause you won't. they will sound like regular decent headphones. Not even my laptop can push these properly. To fully power it, you need a headphone amplifier or a good receiver. When hooked up to said good receiver, these headphones shine brightly, and if you use a decent headphone amp, then you can enjoy a better quality of sound while on the go.<br /><br />Finally this isn't a problem as much as a nuisance. The cord, 10', is very, very long. of course these headphones were not made to be walking around with all the times, but eventually you will leave the house and wear these while you walk. The cord is perfect when listening in your house from a receiver or computer, but while moving, it really gets in the way. I hear the cord itself isn't that durable, so walking around and snagging it will lessen the life of the cord. I only wish these headphones came with a secondary cord that was about 3-5 feet in length. since it's easy to switch out cords, it would be perfect to have two that can fit to any situation. there is a twisted version of the cord that's about 4' but many reviews say that its more poorly made and besides that, it cost about $30 here on amazon (it's called EK 500s).<br /><br />If none of what I just said is a deal breaker for you, then go ahead and purchase them. they are really quite excellent.
B007C3TVNA|4.0|Trying to depict the state of mind of someone who is both emotionally and mentally unstable and suffering from the after effects of a tragic event is very difficult to achieve in a cinematic language but I think Lynne Ramsay has succeeded well here. From the disjointed and fractured chronological order to the arty and surreal tone of the main character's flashbacks and visions, you get a good sense of what it is perhaps this poor mother is going through. Her mind must be all over the place, burdened by guilt and the memories of her horrid time as the mother of her nasty son. The colour red is very prevalent throughout and is something she cannot escape, from the red paint that she is forever scrubbing from her house, hands and car windscreen to the bloodbath she has to bear witness to at the end and which she will forever blame herself. The guilt and living hell will be inescapable.<br /><br />There is always a danger in these kinds of films (and books) that they may not be wholly psychologically accurate and raise more questions than they answer. This film, and I understand the book also, doesn't really attempt to answer the nature vs nurture question in any serious balanced way - and how could we expect it to, that is a realm for science and psychology and something which may take decades before they are able to arrive at a more definitive answer. But art has been this way for millennia, it rarely if ever provides answers to big questions but is more about offering up one's own assumptions or take on these issues and inspiring debate.<br /><br />There is a hint of a suggestion in the film that the mother wasn't quite ecstatic at the idea of being a mother (the scene in the antenatal class where she doesn't seem particularly enthusiastic) but there is never really a suggestion that once the child is born that she is anything but a good mother. The film leans far more towards the suggestion that the child was born bad and there was absolutely nothing the mother could have done about it. We see her trying hard from an early age to bond with Kevin but he seems to somehow despise her and manipulate her emotions even from a very young age - and this is where I question the psychological accuracy? Is it possible for a young toddler under two years old to despise anything and understand how to manipulate emotions in a callous way?<br /><br />And in this respect, we could see the film as simply a story about the fears of parenthood from the viewpoint from someone who is not yet a parent, i.e. what happens if I have a naturally bad child who I cannot control and have a positive effect on...? And so a psychologically accurate definitive account of the nature vs nurture is beside the point but rather a story that tries to represent these fears, however irrational and they may be, is what we are engaging with.
0061336459|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read on the psychology and \\"money blueprint\\" of why I and others are where they are with respect to money. I have told many others about this book and have bought 2 extra copies for those closest to me. T. Harv Eker has a goldmine of information. I highly recommend this book if you are into personal development or financial independence.

B00000AFWZ|5.0|the little known but important fact is..... the sixties pretty much died at Woodstock... the complaints of the punkers 8 or 9 years later were on display for all to witness by 1969.... the bloat, the self importance of the C,S&N crap that was all too quickly stealing the fire that was realized w/ the advent of the brit invasion and it's effect on a snarly yank generation... i love Hendrix, Cream and the technically more adept musicians that came to the fore in 1967... the echoes of a FU attitude was still quite evident but it slid away, away, away as '68 became '69... the hippie musicians backed away from  explorations of inner dimensions and fled to the homespun and comforting embrace of more traditional musics... the music \\"biz\\" became more \\"biz\\" than music.... Led Zep stormed the gates of super$$$heaven as the rest morphed into prog, glam, punk, post punk, new wave, no wave, etc, ad nauseum (labels for those who need a life style identification stamp for ease of use!).... the Who made operas, the coke snorting set discoed and the whole 50 minutes of the sixties revolution ('64-'68) in consciousness came crashing down with the advent of Reagan and the social push back... but prior to that the orgy of self importance that ensued at Watkins Glen in NY in August 69 was and always has been the \\"problem\\" with what was carried out of the sixties.... the supposed moral superiority and message that the main exponent of, Mr Dylan himself, had backed away from with his move to morph his music into a philosophical bar band and HAVE SOME FUN, was burdening the stone washed jeans set with a preachy attitude and the music suffered.  ladies and gentlemen, this Rhino collection of youthful spunk represents the real sixties revolution that was lost because... as Pete Townsend has accurately pointed out, \\"the majority of the audience is rather...thick!\\"... in the midst of a whirlwind it's kinda hard to ferret out what's important and what ain't (i.e. motivation over technique! soulover sales, open mind over calcified woodstock generation attitude)... growing up in the once great state of Michigan i was front and center to witness the midwestern result of young men grabbing cheap guitars and vox amps and farfisa organs with limited skills and often (not always, thank God!) the results were wonderful.... twas' all about dancing, no?  do yourself a favor... buy this 4 disc set, and hear the real \\"punk\\" bands and experience why most of the glop that has come down the corporate pike ever since has been a mere shadow on the sidewalk that blazed summer hot as these acne ravaged madmen plied their trade inside the teen club hell holes of this, our once proud land...as the tea party gets wilder and the corporate hacks walk like giants thru the deserted streets where forecloser signs are as plentiful as , um, FORECLOSER SIGNS!, we'll still need some actual inspiration to see past opinions that wash over us from the world wide(spider)web... as long as someone, somewhere can love that dirty water then all is not lost!!!!

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|It's all been leading up to this folks: the grand spectacle known as The Avengers.  While Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man II, Thor, and Captain America: The First Avenger all the set the stage and were great superhero films in their own respective rights, none of them could really convey the sheer amount of pure awesome that The Avengers contains.  Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has returned to Earth wreck havoc in his quest for the Tesseract (i.e., the Cosmic Cube), forcing Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) to set forward his Avengers Initiative.  Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Bruce Banner/Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) unite to take down the baddies, resulting in some brilliant action set pieces and massive amounts of destruction that you've got to see to believe.  Director Joss Whedon, best known for creating Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Firefly, as well as launching Marvel's brilliant Astonishing X-Men comic series, manages to handle the proceedings shockingly well and equally balance (for the most part, sadly Hawkeye seems to get the short end of the stick) each character, with all of them getting their own respective moments in the limelight.  That, and Mark Ruffalo is an absolute smash (no pun intended) as Banner, and the Hulk moments are some of the best and most insanely enjoyable segments you'll see in any mainstream superhero film ever.  While it isn't without it's flaws, The Avengers is a smashing blockbuster that will be extremely hard to top in terms of spectacle or action set-pieces...and of course, like any of Marvel's recent films, the post-credits sequences set the stage for even bigger (and more cataclysmic) events to unfold in future installments.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'll be honest; I probably wouldn't have read the first Wool if it hadn't been 99 cents.  The story certainly sounded interesting, but I don't know if I would have been willing to purchase a 75 page story if it had been more than 2 dollars.  This seems to have been the author's intention: more people might give it a shot at 99 cents and then some of those people would absolutely love it (although it was just the one story at the beginning).  Either way, it definitely seems to have paid off for him.<br /><br />I'm also kind of glad I discovered it recently, because the wait in between books would have been agonizing!  I read the first story in one sitting and then immediately purchased the Omnibus.  I'm now getting ready to start reading the \\"prequel,\\" First Shift, and can't wait to read more by this author.  It is the first book in a while that has kept me up at night, unable to put it down, and made me truly eager to find out what was going to happen next.  I highly recommend it to lovers of science fiction, dystopian fiction, or anyone who loves a well-crated (if often troubling) story.  Bonus: at $5.99 for the Omnibus, it is an incredible bargain!

B0088RQ4X4|4.0|I never read the original books the movie was based off of, but when I rented the movie I was very much aware of the negative press that came from this so I was not sure what to expect. I wouldn't say I was pleasantly surprised with the movie, but it is definitely better than its been given credit for by mainstream media and critics. The overall story is decent, the acting is ok, and I never found myself bored at any point in the movie. What I watched didn't look like a $250 million dollar movie though, especially when compared to a movie like Avatar, that didn't even cost as much.<br /><br />A couple of things really hurt this movie. The first is the name. I cant understand how Disney could allow such a horrible name for a $250 million dollar movie. The name John Carter does not make people interested and was never going to get anyone to spend money at the theater. This is just stupidly obvious. I'm pretty certain that if the movie had been called Princess of Mars it would have made millions more just from that since the focus would be more on the beautiful princess than on Taylor Kitsch. The smaller issue for me is the setting. When the books were written our knowledge of astronomy was much less than it is now, so I found myself uninterested in going to the theater to watch a movie about all this life and fighting on Mars, when that's not even remotely possible. Avatar was based on a fake world so you could more easily connect to the story than John Carter, when its based on the planet next to us that we know is cold, barely has an atmosphere, and has no intelligent life.<br /><br />Once the movie was available to rent from home I was interested because I enjoy sci-fi, and it was definitely worth renting, but the horrible marketing for this movie really hurt it, and for some of us the unrealistic setting also detracted from the movie. It was nice in 1917 when the book was written, but just doesn't work as well in 2012. Its too bad because I think Andrew Stanton did a decent job making the movie, but I highly doubt we will ever see the sequels.<br /><br />John Carter is not really worth the $10+ to see in a theater, but it is worth the $3-4 to rent on a evening when you just want some decent entertainment.d a decent job making the movie, but I highly doubt we will ever see the sequels.<br /><br />John Carter is not really worth the $10+ to see in a theater, but it is worth the $3-4 to rent on a evening when you just want some decent entertainment.

B005LAIHXQ|1.0|If you liked Alien/Aliens and must see it, wait for the rental first, then decide if you should buy the DVD. If you like everything having to do with the Alien franchise such as AvP, then you are probably safe in getting the DVD.<br /><br />This movie was marketed so well with an excellent trailer, complete with the 'aahhhh' siren sounds from the original 1979 Alien trailer, which leads prospective viewers to believe it will be a horror type prequel to Alien. I would have been more satisfied had I paid to watch the trailer looped for two hours, because it had the right background music, the right dialogue, and the right scenes. The rest of the movie should have been left on the cutting room floor. \\"Cut it off! Cut it off!\\"<br /><br />It's a B rated sci-fi TV show at best with interesting concepts poorly executed.<br /><br />Some people may consider the next comments SPOILERS:<br /><br />It's not a horror movie, but it does have all the aspects from the Alien franchise in it such as how the alien attacks and reproduces with scenes that are supposed to be gross/gory but fall flat. The background music was similar to that of Apollo 13 when Tom Hanks was excited to be going to the moon. The alien type creatures looked like they came from the movie Sphere or an aquarium. I found myself laughing half the time, especially when \\"the claw\\" from Toy Story appeared.<br /><br />I actually liked the concept of the evolution of the \\"alien\\" to show something different and of it being more of a space exploration movie. I liked the concept of maybe 3 prequel sequels. I also like the concept of what I believe the twist is going to be in the sequel to this movie, which would explain the Space Jockeys' motives. Unfortunately, it just was not executed well at all.<br /><br />Other reviewers, who downgraded the movie, were correct. It lacked character development. Do I need to read their resumes? No, but some more interaction among the crew would've helped like they did with Aliens or Blade Runner for that matter. Then there's the illogical things the characters do. For example, in one scene that is in the trailer involving Shaw dropping to her knees, logical dialogue would have been \\"What happened? Are you okay?\\", instead it's more like \\"Hello. Nice of you to stop by.\\"<br /><br />SPOILER****SPOILER*****SPOILER - Just as an added side note for people who watched it, but thought it didn't correspond to Alien correctly. Prometheus is not a direct prequel. The Space Jockey and his ship are NOT the same Space Jockey and ship that the Nostromo found. Prometheus was on LV-223 with pyramid structures that are supposed to tie in with Earth's pyramids. The Nostromo went to LV-426 and found a ship that had crashed on its own accord. Remember from Aliens, Ripley said, \\"..It was not from there. It was a derelict spacecraft....\\" The LV-223 Space Jockeys had begun terra forming the place and were using it as a storage facility. Maybe the sequel explains how a different ship ended up on LV-426 with eggs instead of vases. Perhaps it's the ship Dr. Shaw was flying at the end of Prometheus. END SPOILER*** END SPOILER *****END SPOILER<br /><br />My advice: Watch the TV viral videos and the trailers and then watch Alien again instead.
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|When I heard that John Carter of Mars was being made with Antonio Sabato, Jr, I had high hopes. They were dashed. The movie didn't make the best use of Edgar Rice Burroughs's stories or his imaginative writing. Most of the elements were in place, but the acting was marginal, even with Antonio's flexing muscles and sharply sculpted cheekbones, but the princess, played by one-time porn princess, Traci Lords, was lacking in everything, especially emotion and acting ability. There was plenty of skin, though. It was not up to my -- or anyone else's -- expectations.<br /><br />Along comes Taylor Kitsch in his turn as John Carter, a slow talking, brilliant man born out of his time and transported to Mars to a world he doesn't understand with abilities and strengths he didn't know were possible. John Carter definitely made the grade. There were some small bobbles, but this all star cast has done a creditable job with Burroughs's story and with the world of Barsoom he created.<br /><br />The special effects do not intrude but work seamlessly with the live actors and, despite everyone wearing at least some clothing, unlike Burroughs's story where the \\"red men\\" were naked most of the time, the story has been captured admirably. There will always be some difference between books and Hollywood's version, but this version of John Carter is as close as it gets to the book. Bravo!

B006LSZECO|4.0|This is a powerfully imagined and brilliantly written horror story.  Flynn dares us not to be taken in by her many twists of plot and narrative voice, and pulls nearly all her tricks off.  As others have noted, it's hard to get specific without spoiling things for future readers.  The one serious complaint I have is that two of Flynn's characters -- a pampered richer-than-rich young man and his doting mother - are definitely less credible than the other people she creates - they remind me of actors in a Cole Porter song more than living contemporary beings.  But I'm eager - if scared - to read more of Flynn's work.

B004QK5N5W|1.0|This adapter is a complete waste of your money, unless you don't mind spending $30-$40 on something that does 1/4th of what it should do. I purchased this adapter from a local Radio Shack and when I tested it on my iphone, multiple bad things happened. First of all, it somehow takes over the iphone's connectivity and forces it into \\"searching\\" mode. Right when I unplugged the adapter, it loaded the video. I tried this on the Netflix app and the Youtube app, both were EXTREMELY glitchy. Now, on to the MAJOR problem - this adapter does NOT do what 100% of the other HDMI ports on earth do, which is to MIRROR what's happening on one device and SHOW IT on your HDTV. No, thanks to apple and their proprietary nonsense, this adapter ONLY shows video from an app that \\"allows\\" it, so you can't see your homescreen, you can't see angry birds, you can't see 99% of what you can do on the iphone. On that note, I find the iphone REALLY, REALLY over-rated anyway.

B0073PPKNM|5.0|Many people have complained about the quality, or lack there of on this new album. I find that the imperfections are what make it so real and original. I think the mellow rhythms and smooth tempo's are a nice change from the electronic, synthesized rap/rock/country/pop music that floods the radios and audibly rapes my ears on a daily basis. She is a refreshing break from the repetitive preteen lyrics and simple beats of today's popular music. I applaud her for taking a risk while still keeping her jazz roots, and experimenting with some new sounds.<br /><br />Also, for those of you complaining about how it's \\"too mellow,\\" she was hit by a car when she was younger, and physically can not listen to loud, erratic music. She is making music that suits her own well-being, not yours.

B007WULJ5G|5.0|Here are a few important things to know if you are planning to buy this film. I won't mention the extreme, graphic nature of the film except for now. Everyone already knows this, so no point in stating it. And same with the story line of the film.<br /><br />But anyways, I'm sure it may be confusing with all the reviews saying \\"it's cut.\\" Let me get this straight: The version that says \\"uncut\\" is in fact uncut. The other one is a cut version by about 30+ seconds. But those are valuable seconds; if cut you can hardly tell what is going on. So DO NOT buy the cut version. It's a complete waste, and an insult to the film.<br /><br />As for the film itself, I absolutely love it. It is a favorite film of mine, and people who hate it are just people who can't take it. Which is fine, I completely accept that not many people can watch a movie of this caliber. So I say: If you can handle it, see it. Because you just might love it as much as I do.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|What a great book! The story is told through the eyes of a dog. I was never bored and always looking forward to what would happen next. You also learn a lot about racecar driving even if you are not into racecar driving it opens up your mind. Also an inspiring book on how to never, ever give up. A must read!
B003N0XDT4|3.0|Hmmm....maybe it's just not for me.  I returned it because it left me totally unimpressed.  This is one of those times that I got hooked in by good reviews.  Here is what the device does:  It will deliver increased volume without compromising sound quality.  I didn't feel that it increases the quality of the sound of the source device.  If you feel that you are not getting enough volume from your device, then this is probably a good buy.  I used it with both my Macbook and Droid phone.  I didn't buy it because I wanted more volume, I just wanted something that would make the uninspiring sound of my Macbook to sound better.  In my opinion, it didn't give me better sound quality, just more sound.  The gadget is cool though.  It's very high tech and sleek looking.  Has a nice display and a couple of operation buttons that control volume and the menu.  I think it would be convenient for plane travel - you can plug 2 sets of headphones into it which is great if you are traveling with someone and want to watch a DVD and on a plane you could always use more volume because of the loud engines.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|its a great book. I like it that the author wanted to be a bit realistic about the ending not making it a fairytale but it still felt rushed at the end. very few details about their fate. Through out the books the author fills in every detail of the story but at the end there are so many things left unanswered.
0062119044|2.0|I think We Need to Talk About Kevin does discuss some very important issues--maternal ambivalence, psycopathy, the role of parents in society and the family, the status of mothers--but it doesn't do it very well.  The characters are, I think, its downfall.<br /><br />First, the narrator, Eva, is one of the most unbelievable characters I have ever met.  I think the author was trying to make her out to be a complicated, sophisticated, well-educated woman of the world, but one has to wonder why such a woman, who has always been independent and sure of what she wants, would have a baby that she did not want.  I'm not saying that society can't pressure people into things, but Eva just doesn't seem like the type.  And, once she realizes that Kevin is a psychopath, it also seems unbelievable that she wouldn't seek professional help or have him committed or even divorce Franklin and leave him to deal with it.  Also, why, when she KNOWS Kevin is a murderous monster, would she leave a beloved daughter like Celia alone with him?!  Perhaps the author is saying that Eva is subconsciuously trying to kill Celia, but throughout the book, Eva repeatedly shows that Celia is far and away her favorite child.  Wouldn't having Celia make Eva determine to lock Kevin away once and for all?<br /><br />Also, Eva is unlikable.  She is so unlikable that it is difficult to empathize with her.  Sometimes one can sympathize, like when she makes repeated attempts to connect with Kevin and try to make him act like a human being, but most times she is infuriating.  The author portrays her as a sophisticated, well-educated traveler who should never have had children, but she comes off as a superior, sulky, resentful spoiled brat, the kind of intellectual who gives intellectuals a bad name.  She comes across as a whiner, too, constantly sniveling about the glorious career she gave up for the kid she didn't want.  There's lots of women who have children and careers at the same time, and it's difficultto believe that, once she had children, Eva wouldn't follow that path.<br /><br />One also can't help but feel that one reason--maybe even the main reason--why Eva hates Kevin so much is not only that he is sadistic, but that he constantly calls her out on her narcissistic posing. One of the few incidents where the reader empathizes with Kevin is when, after Eva grumbles about how fat people deserve contempt, he says, \\"Is there anything, or anybody, you don't feel superior to?\\"  Eva has no answer to this because it is true, and this makes her resent Kevin even more.  Indeed, a triumph of the book is that, just as Eva is the only one who sees Kevin clearly, Kevin is the only one who really sees her.<br /><br />Other reviewers have already mentioned how incredibly one-dimensioned Franklin and Celia are.  Franklin is blind beyond belief about Kevin's obvious sadism.  No one, however fond a parent, could possibly be that stupid about a kid's misbehavior, especially when the bad behavior continues and gets worse as the child grows older.  Celia is the stereotype of the Female Victim: blond, fragile, wimpy, stupid, with no personality (for an author supposedly in favor of women's rights, this is a disturbingly flat and cardboard picture of a female character).  Celia is obviously Eva's favorite child, and it is impossible to believe that Celia, constantly petted and loved, wouldn't tell on her brother to the mother who constantly favors her above Kevin.  In real life, children have a very keen sense of who the parents favor, and Celia would certainly know that Eva would believe her about Kevin's cruelty, and not hesitate to tell her all about it, especially when repeatedly entreated to do so.<br /><br />Unlike other readers, I do not find Kevin's psycopathy completely unbelievable: some people are born psycopaths.  His relationship, and deep connection, with Eva is interesting, even as it's disturbing: it's almost as though he takes her sense of superiority to the next logical level, which is one reason why he is so frightening.  But he is so awful--not just psychotic, but annoying, developmentally backward and bad at school--that he comes across as yet another stereotype: the Monster.  There's nothing interesting about stereotypes.  And, even more unconvincingly, the moment he goes to jail, presto!  He instantly becomes a human being, scared and affectionate and compassionate and repentent.  If Kevin is that evil, I can't see how prison is going to make him into a better person, let alone so quickly.  It's almost as if the author is saying that children are better off in jail because parents inevitably destroy their kids.  Which is sick, nihilistic and just plain wrong.<br /><br />So it's an interesting premise, and the book has its moments, but ultimately fails to live up to its promise.
B005IA9JZO|4.0|We must have watched \\"Hook\\" 100 times on VHS with our daughter and our first grandson.  We ordered it from Amazon on Blu-ray and it was like the first time we watched it.  Our granddaughters thought it was great.  It was well worth the money for Blu-ray.

B007N85ZXY|2.0|That's what Young told Richie Furay and Stephen Stills when he cancelled the promised nationwide tour of Buffalo Springfield. \\"Don't Mess with the Muse\\".<br /><br />So this is what the \\"Muse\\" has produced: 11 un-original songs with similar arrangements played badly with the reckless abandon that is the trademark of Crazy Horse.  The time spent recording this album was probably roughly the same amount of time it takes to listen to it.<br /><br />Buffalo Springfield was the best band Neil Young ever played in.  Crazy Horse is undoubtably the worst.  He had a clear choice for his next project: to play with either his best band or his worst.  Predictably, he chose the latter.  When he plays with superior musicians, Young always rises to the occasion.  When he plays with inferior musicians, he invariably sinks to their level.  This has been true of every single Crazy Horse venture since Danny Whitten's death.<br /><br />Neil Young has been past his prime for over a decade now.  Sometimes I wish he'd just give it up rather than dredge up one more terrible album.<br /><br />To the egregious \\"oh boy FIVE STARS!\\" posters here who think Americana is a joke, the joke may be on you.<br /><br />Le Nois indeed!

1444710338|5.0|If you like protein and need to lose weight, this is a fabulous plan to follow.  Although I have just begun, I lost 9 pounds in 1 week and miraculously I have not been hungry.  Oh yes, I still crave the foods that got me in to this situation, but dropping this amount of weight so quickly has me extremely motivated to continue.  The loss slows down now, but I still feel physically good, and psychologically fantastic!  In control!  I've done lots of reading about nutrition, glycemic index, metabolism, etc., over the years as I have struggled with my weight.  Everything that Dr. Dukan says in his book makes sense. It is as if he has written this book just for me.  I look forward to continuing with his plan and then maintaining my weight, once and for all.[[ASIN:B005JTTDWS TheDukan Diet byDukan]]

I downloaded this based on a couple of friends' (who usually have great taste in music) comments and as it turns out they were right, this is an absolutely fantastic CD.  Anyone who likes hard rock should pick this up... I've been listening to this a ton over the past few weeks (more than the new Foo etc...) and can say it continues to get better upon each listen.  Great song structure, amazing guitar work and fantastic lyrics in a complex simplicity kind of way.  Not a weak song out of the 13.  Highly recommended!

0345803485|1.0|This book is the 2-Buck Chuck of the literary world...99% of people you talk to will tell you it's awesome, when in reality, it's acrid swill in a bottle. Or in this case, triple crap in a paperback. The writing is, to put it kindly, sloppy and pedestrian. The plot is virtually nonexistent. Furthermore, neither protagonist is particularly likeable; he's a domineering jackass and she's a simpering moron who can't string more than 2 words together into a comprehensive thought. Unless, of course, those two words are 'holy' and 'crap'. I can't figure out how this book has taken the world by storm. I'm pretty sure reading it killed a chunk of my gray matter, but not enough to delude me into thinking it's quality fiction (key word: fiction). Fortunately I had the wherewithal to read a few reviews before purchasing the book, and checked it out from the library instead. If I'd paid ten dollars for this, I might've had to kill myself afterward. I still kind of want to kill myself just so I don't have to live with the memory.

B00756GKBA|4.0|I have been listening to Madonna since I was 5 years old via when she first hit the scene. I have found her albums to be inventive, unique, and inspiring. She always stood out and has shown she had the chops to have a career this long. I was very excited about MDNA and with William Orbit helping with the album once again as he did on Ray of Light and Music. I was not disappointed. The stand out songs on this album are Girl Gone Wild, I'm A Sinner, I'm Addicted, Superstar, Turn Up The Radio, and Gang Bang. I usually listen to albums of artists I love anyway despite what reviews may say or however sales may be. I do not base who I listen to and like on sales. I highly enjoyed this album and appreciated it more with each listen. The combination of club infused tracks with ballads works well on this platform. Kudos to Madonna for another album worth waiting for.

Kelly does not hide who she is which makes her music all the better to listen to. Stand out songs are Dark Side, Stronger, You Love Me, and Honestly. These songs felt very personal and easy to relate to. I have had them on repeat a lot when dealing with difficult periods in life. This is a strong album from one of my favorite singers. She has the singing chops and writing talent to show on this album. This is a definite must have.

It was not what I expected but I loved it.  I am not a person who usually enjoys sci-fi, but I guess I can't say that anymore.  This book is truly unique and I will be happy to pass it on to friends.  Tip--buy the book not the ebook, because the pictures truly make the story.
B00846REIS|1.0|Can you say copy cat?  This book is a rip off on Fifty and it hurt to read.  Talk about trying too hard.  Just to be fair I did read the whole book all I can say is I wished I would have used the time to re-read Fifty Shades of Grey.  From the names to the minor tweaks it was just bad.  I am shocked that a publisher would publish a book like this right after Fifty.  Read it if you want you compare the similarities ... but that is all it is worth.  A few tweaks did not make it work... in fact it tried a little to hard to be like Fifty.

B005M61PGA|5.0|Let me say up front: I've never reviewed a product and I'm a big Katie Melua fan. I can't deny I'm biased in favor of anything 'Katie.' But Katie has talent that defies the boundaries of normalcy. There is no way this album can be rated ONLY five stars! It is, without a doubt, the most beautiful collection of music on a CD I've ever heard. It's all I listen to when I'm in my car. With each song I'm torn between not wanting the song to end and anxiously awaiting the next. This album exudes quality and I can't imagine anyone being disappointed after plunking down their hard-earned money to buy it.

B00007BKVC|5.0|Ridley Scott has had a good run of things.  Sure, he's not done, but looking back at his career he could easily retire happy with what he's produced.  He's basically created a cultural landmark for each decade.  Between `Alien' (1979), `Blade Runner' (1982), `Thelma and Louise' (1991) and `Gladiator' (2000) he's established himself as a director full of range and talent and sustainability.  I have the utmost faith that his upcoming `The Counselor' will prove his talents once again (what a cast, what a story!) and cement his efforts for the next decade of film.<br /><br />For me, `Thelma and Louise' could possibly be his finest film.  I have a very soft spot in my heart for this beautiful movie, thanks in large part to everyone involved and the depth of passion they poured into this project.  There is no doubt in my mind that this is the best film of 1991, and that year was astounding (`BEAUTY AND THE BEAST'!!!) so that is saying a lot.<br /><br />`Thelma and Louise' tells the story of two best friends aptly named Thelma and Louise.  These two women, iconic thanks to the flawless way in which their characters are developed by both Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis, are victims of a society that takes advantage of them.  Thelma is being suffocated by her controlling husband, and Louise is a sassy waitress who is desperate to help Thelma break free and breathe some fresh air so-to-speak.  What starts out as a harmless road-trip turns into a panic when a man tries to force himself on Thelma, and Louise is forced to take matters into her own hands.  Now, on the run and paranoid of being found, these two women build on their strong bond as they realize all they have in the world is each other.<br /><br />Ridley directs this film with such finesse, allowing these two characters to really shine.  He builds a film around two of the most interesting characters and give the audience a reason to be drawn to them.  But really, the star of this show is Susan Sarandon.  Wait, the star of this show is Geena Davis.  WAIT!  Seriously, these two women are so in tune with one another it's ridiculous.  There are many films that rely on co-leads to carry them and there is usually one particular standout who steals the bulk of the attention.  That isn't really so here.  For me, Sarandon and Davis make the perfect Yin and Yang.  Their differences only help to balance out the whole in creating such a refreshing take on the buddy film, because they complete one another in ways that I haven't seen before.  Sarandon's breed of `no-nonsense' aggressor is perfectly balanced out by Davis's naïve sensuality.  Her flirtatious innocence plays devil's advocate to Sarandon's intense `all knowing' persona.  They draw off one another and push the envelope in such marvelous ways.<br /><br />If ever the Academy should have had a tie in Best Actress, it was 1991 (but alas, they went with that Foster woman instead).<br /><br />With a strong supporting cast that includes a breakout performance from Brad Pitt and a beautifully sincere performance from Harvey Keitel, Ridley Scott's masterpiece is one for the ages.  It touches upon such deeply moving themes as friendship and love and it manages to stick with you for all times.  I can still feel the chills I felt the very first time I saw this film; those tears still staining my cheek to this very day.r of this show is Geena Davis.  WAIT!

B002VWNID6|2.0|When I was but a wee lad (six, actually) this film was released.  I actually didn't see it till I was a bit older, but in my young adolescence, pre-teen years, this was a favorite of mine.  I've always had a thing for the story of Robin Hood and its many variations.  It's a valiant story with such available depth and it really does run the gamut of checkmarks to make a great adventure film.<br /><br />Having sat down recently for a rewatching, something I haven't done in years, I was prepared to completely fall in love all over again.  In my head I was about to see something grand and epic and, well, wonderful.  Sadly, my recollection of this film is far grander than what I was actually presented with and I began to question my hazy memory.  Did I really love this film so much in my youth?  I've tried to make it a point to revisit some of my fonder cinematic memories of my childhood, and mostly I've remained happy with them.  In fact, with some films (`The Neverending Story' for instance) I walked away even more enamored by a recent viewing.  In this case, I was left somewhat stumped by my initial adoration of the film.<br /><br />`Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves' is just not that good.<br /><br />First of all, I have grown to hate Kevin Costner.  In my youth I didn't know any better.  I didn't really care about acting until I was in my early teens.  But, in my adulthood I have found Kevin Costner to be one of those actors who does NOTHING for me.  He's barely a notch above Keanu Reeves in my book, for the man is so wooden and can't emote for anything (but I will admit that he was pretty effective in `Dances With Wolves' and downright Oscar worthy in `The Upside of Anger').  I just find him so dull.  Here, he is basically a prop.  He doesn't serve any real justice to the character, doesn't layer him with any true development, and that accent is horrific.  The biggest problem with this film though, is that it basically takes on the persona of its star.  The film is boring.  It just drags out and doesn't infuse itself with anything arresting, outside of Alan Rickman who is borderline ham but the kind of ham I want to lather with honey and devour (and no, that is not a sexual reference but more a figurative way of saying that I totally dug what he did with the character despite the fact that it was completely out of tone with the actual film).<br /><br />The theme song is beautifully remembered, albeit completely sappy and not right for this film, and the technical achievements (sets, costumes, makeup, action sequences) are actually pretty great, but overall I found the film surprisingly sleep inducing, ridiculously unauthentic (like, at least try to make this seem logical or historical) and the acting outside of Rickman was just a total waste.<br /><br />Just a little suggestion; try watching the Scott/Crowe collaboration for a more engrossed retelling of the story.  It isn't perfect, but it is leagues above this mess.ing.

B005LAIHY0|3.0|Prometheus is not only Ridley Scott's long awaited return to sci-fi but, also to the same universe that his breakout classic Alien took place in. Prometheus is a prequel of sorts detailing events that may have set the story of Alien in motion and created it's iconic creatures. So why at the climax are we so unsatisfied by what we just saw? As with all Scott's films Prometheus is a gorgeously designed and filmed movie but, despite the interesting set up about the possible origins of man and the existence of other superior beings, the visuals are a just an empty candy coating as the film goes nowhere with these ideas. We get a story about Dr. Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Repace) who discovers numerous occurances of a hieroglyphic throughout various earth times and cultures which she interprets as an invitation from a extraterrestrial race. Enter the Weyland Corporation (The villainous \\"Company\\" from the Alien films) who fund an expedition but, apparently with there own agenda. And the Prometheus is off to investigate with it's cliche' corporate villain captain (Charlize Theron, who really doesn't do much but be a company bitch) and the usual suspicious android, David (Michael Fassbender who has the best role). And here lies the problem, we start out expecting to find something fascinating and Damon Lindelof and Jon Spaihts' script gives us a cliche' story of extraterrestrials whose intentions aren't as noble as first believed and slimy corporate villains who want to use what they find for there own nefarious purposes. Sorry, been there, done that. Seen it all before. The beings true purpose in their genetic tampering is never revealed nor does it make sense to leave evidence of their existence on earth when they are ultimately up to no good. Prometheus leaves the most interesting questions unanswered and instead moves the plot along by having characters do the stupidest things... seriously, genius scientists taking their helmets off in an alien environment without any clue that there might be an undetected threat?... Are you kidding me?... I'll admit there are a few tense scenes, althought the film is rather laid back pace wise, and could have used a lot more suspense and energy if it wasn't going to get overly interesting with it' story. And most aggrevating of all, is that the film is open ended. It doesn't even give us a satisfying conclusion. It leaves the most important questions unanswered and implies we have to wait for yet another film to find out how this story ends and how it links to the begining of Alien, which it eventually will. A major disappointment from Ridely Scott and company.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|The buzz around this book is what persuaded me to buy it, and from the first chapter I struggled to find any redeeming value.  But I pushed through, hoping that the next chapter would be the one where the story turned the corner.  What a sheer and utter disappointment. I believe this is the worst book I have ever read.  The \\"relationship\\" and \\"sex\\" is far-fetched and completely absurd.  I fail to see how this book is garnering such great reviews and a rabid followers. The ending of the book is an especially infuriating ploy, specifically designed to sell the next book in the series.<br /><br />Stupid.<br />Inane.<br />Immature.<br />Ridiculous.<br />Crap.<br /><br />I hope this saves at least one person from wasting their money.

I regretted I read it and at the end, I was just flipping and skipping all the similar boring sex scenes, to get to the expected and disappointing ending.<br />Again, how do these books became the best sellers?

B006VP1OYO|5.0|Here's MBV's &#34;Louder Than Bombs&#34;, and it's about time. It's ridiculous that the first 9 songs are so hard to come by, let alone the fact that I can only get the CDs from amazon.com (too hungry). My local CD/record store would charge upwards of $60 to order this in the from of a deluxe Japanese import.  A quick check between both the Tremelo and Glider EPs and this revealed no major volume shifts. The mixes seem to be basically the same, although I think the new 'digital' one's sometime seem to contain a few pops here and there.  Disc 2's last 7 songs are also rare, some unreleased. The new stuff is awesome and could've made for great EP material.  I would recommend this to fans, especially if you don't have most of the songs anymore, like me. I think it makes for a good introduction and it's a nice set-up for &#34;Loveless&#34; as well - mind blown to pieces.
0439023491|5.0|Book Review: Catching Fire<br /><br />The great bestseller Hunger Games was a huge hit and its sequel is no exception. In the book, Catching Fire, by Suzanne Collins after winning the Hunger Games by tricking the Gamemakers into allowing two tributes become victors, whom were the lovebirds Katniss and Peeta, they thought that it would be easy living but it was quite the opposite once Mr. Snow and the capitol seek revenge by setting up the Quarter Quell. In this Katniss and Peeta are forced to re-enter the arena with other winning tributes. Katniss has also heard news about uprisings with Katniss and Peeta being the symbolical leaders of it. They discover the secrets behind the arena, new relationships are made, old relationships are strained, and an ending that nobody could ever imagine. Throughout the book Suzanne Collins constantly shows the capitols overpowering control over the districts and almost shows it as a threat to what could be possible in our future today.<br /> Suzanne Collins has created this trilogy of novels almost as a warning to us today of the possibilities of what could happen to us similar to that of the novel 1984 but in a more simple fashion. Based on Suzanne Collins background of being involved in major corporations of children based books and television shows such as Nickelodeon and Kids WB, she finds great satisfaction of making her work mainly acquire the attention the younger generations. Also based on her influence by the book Alice in Wonderland she began to think more about the \\"what if?\\" part of life. This \\"what if?\\" is a part in which that is very enjoyable and is a nice change from any normal type of literature and makes the reader think the same things and allows the reader to easily relate to the authors view shown within the novel.<br /> In the book the author writes about multiple occasions in which the capitol and or major governmental power shows its total control over the districts. In the beginning of the book Katniss returns home and finds President Snow (the head of the capitol) in her home and he personally threats her. Another example is when the next Hunger Games come around they made new rules so that both Katniss and Peeta would be put into danger as revenge for being the two victors of any Hunger Games. This example relates to the bigger theme that is normally questioned upon, which is the careful guidance of power and in this case the power was concentrated into one area giving the book a type of dictator feel similar in the book 1984. Also as a result of the last Hunger Games the districts began to build up hope and start an uprising but the capitol issued out more \\"Peacekeepers\\" to destroy any hope that these citizens in any district may build up. This refers back to the \\"what if?\\" factor and also correlates with such examples we've seen throughout world history but now in a modern way. Sometimes we might ask ourselves the question \\"what happens if the United States collapsed\\" in ways that have been shown throughout history when multiple other types of empires saw their final decline, and this book gives one possible answer to this question.<br /> Throughout the book she presents her evidence in a depressing tone and shown through the emotions of the characters. She also uses suspense and the opposite which is total surprise when revealing the doings of the capitol. Many of the characters most importantly Katniss Everdeen constantly have problems in which emotions are strained to their greatest extent, which can at some points become a little repetitive, and almost too dramatic, but does prove her point directly. In the book Katniss is forced to have a \\"loving relationship\\" with Peeta (her teammate), but yet her best friend and possibly even more begins to become jealous while yet Katniss is unable to speak up for herself. This type of conflict is easy to relate more particularly towards teenage girls and all the middle school/high school drama that goes on. She also presents her evidence in a more suspenseful lead and to a very sudden reveal that constantly drags the reader back in for more making the reader unable to put the book down and consider it a true \\"page turner\\". This suddenness is again shown when Katniss gets a visit from the president of the capitol because it was completely uncalled for and is what gets the reader's attention so they can keep reading to figure out the reasons of the president's arrival.<br /> As the book progresses the evidence used to support the warning of what too much power held in ones hands can do to a society, becomes more and more convincing. In the book it describes the setting of different districts and how their all set up in correlation with each other. Although the set up of the districts is almost too basic and straight forward it still gets the point across and convincing enough to warn the reader what too much power in the hands of one person can do. The book also shows how the \\"Gamemakers\\" have the ability to add and subtract anything they want from the arena, only to make it more difficult for the competitors and although isn't truly realistic it highlights the bigger picture of how controlling the government is. As a result of this total control the people of different districts start to rebel, which has been seen many times throughout world history within the society, when the majority is unhappy, it would most likely lead to a form an uprising against the major power, in this case the capitol.<br /> This book with its theme of total control is most strongly related to another book, 1984, in which a similar event occurred in which the whole world came into collapse and was turned into 3 whole parts. Similar to power held into the capitol, in 1984 power is shown through the symbol known as Big Brother and the slogan \\"Big Brother is Watching You\\". 1984 is also similar through its depressing tone that it was written in giving the reader a sense of no hope but yet also a little spark of rebellion although 1984 is just a more advanced and on a higher scale compared to Catching Fire.<br /> This book was more of a fun read while at the same time it did teach lessons in which some were more directly stated than others. It's not a complicated read at all and contains fairly simple and not too complex vocabulary.  This in term should be an accessible read for most readers. I very much enjoyed Suzanne Collins style of writing that it was very enticing but yet not too complicated and I would strongly recommend this to anyone who is up to read something a little more different similar to 1984 but just on a lower scale, no matter the age although the recommended would be in the teenage area, its overall just a fun and consistently interesting book.ts her evidence in a more suspenseful lead and to a very sudden reveal that constantly drags the reader back in for more making the reader unable to put the book down and consider it a true \\"page turner\\".

B0067TGSOK|5.0|As the author of [[ASIN:B0081AG92Y The Lean Startup Guide: How to Take an Idea to Success with Little to No Money]] I really enjoyed this book.  There are a lot of examples in this book that can get your creative side working, and as entrepreneurs that's what we need.<br /><br />I loved hearing so many success stories and how the subjects got to that point.  I really love the way this book goes into detail how to launch a product.  How to get people exciting and talking about your product more before it ever comes out.<br /><br />All the businesses that are talked about in this book were started up for under $1000 and currently are grossing over $50,000.  Those are some great numbers to me.<br /><br />The author does a good job connecting with his readers and supplying some key information about starting a business in this book.  That is why I feel this book deserves a 5/5.
B007LNJ5RI|2.0|The vinyl is actually mastered WORSE than the CD. My ears were ringing after just the first side. The opening acoustic guitar notes sound like a loud pop, as if your ear drum is being punctured.<br /><br />Musically it seems to be in much the same vein as We're Here Because We're Here, which is enjoyable. It sounds a little more poppy, but it's still very much the Anathema style that you would expect at this point. It's just a pity that something so mood-oriented doesn't have better, more immersive sound.<br /><br />Again, DO NOT buy the vinyl. The sound quality of this pressing is inexcusably bad. The CD is decent, though.

I'm a sucker for angst and the hero of the story going through trails and tribulations. That being said, I think Casket of Souls goes back to the style of the first book in the Nightrunner series. Perfectly safe for teens to read and not descriptive at all when it comes to more intimate scenes. A good solid fantasy with a mystery plot that, while resolved rather abruptly, still delivered an enjoyable reading experience. I would definitely recommend this book as a well written sequel in this terrific series.

If you want to listen to something that rocks and doesn't sound like anything that you have ever heard before then pick this album up.  Ghost to me are like if Merciful Fate were to do an album with Blue Oyster Cult.  The songs, arrangements and riffs are so catchy it's insane.  It completely blew my mind to actually read the lyrics.  They are completely sinister and satanic, but you would never expect it because of the tones in which they are delivered.  Even after you figure out they are singing about human sacrifices you can't help but still sing along.  FYI the album cover art is a tribute to the horror movie Salem's Lot.  Enjoy!
B005LAIGOQ|3.0|When reading my movie review, I'd like you to please consider the perspective of an individual who has seen many films in his life - most especially the horror genre has always fascinated me since I was 7-8 years old. There is nothing like the exhilarating feeling of a good scare whether you are watching a serial killer storyline unfold or a supernatural narrative take place. Having had the rare pleasure, but more often the discontentment, of having viewed many a Horror movie, I have instinctively learned to anticipate the plot of a story or predict the scenes. It isn't only that I've seen so many films with a similar scheme, but rather that there a lot of film studios that are only interested in making a profit and fail to make a good effort at hiring decent screenwriters, cinematographers, directors and so on. After all, it is a business and financing films for a profit is worthy of concern.<br /><br />I'll end this involuntary history lesson by briefly acknowledging the return of Hammer films as producers of The Woman In Black - since the 1930's, Hammer has come to be known as a well-respected institution. Imitation being the highest compliment possible, other film studios began adopting a `Hammer formula' and churned out films like there was no tomorrow, unconsciously causing Hammer to collapse and shut down amidst the sea of Hammer \\"wanna be's\\". Marking Hammer's return to film from its deep slumber is the gothic supernatural thriller The Woman In Black.<br /><br />I would like to echo what has been already stated about the film - disturbingly moody, palpable environment, eerie soundtrack, etc. but also offer a comparison between The Woman In Black and The Changeling. No, not the Angelina Jolie movie, but the George C. Scott film from 1980. The most striking aspect of these 2 films is the obvious fact that both Radcliffe and Scott play widowers males still grieving over the loss of a loved one. What follows is the collapse of rational thinking through a fractured emotional state of being into the belief of an afterlife and everything that comes with that notion. Both films allow the suspense and scares to build to a crescendo instead of implementing scenes of gore or devices of carnage. Both characters become infatuated, almost to the point of being spellbound, by the mysterious goings-on respectively but whereas Scott is adept at allowing the physical and emotional out pour to connect visually, Radcliffe is only capable at portraying a sense of melancholy. Even at the end of the film, he seems slightly impassive and misses an optimal opportunity to come about full circle with the destiny of his life via his actions.<br /><br />Bottom Line: There is plenty to like about The Woman In Black and if you go into it armed with patience (the action unfolds slow but deliberate), the firm awareness that Radcliffe will not be portraying his trademark wizard boy alter ego, and a firm acceptance that horror can be defined in many varied ways (that includes Justin Bieber's music), then you will be handsomely rewarded with a clever, well fashioned film. Radcliffe has done well and I'm confident he will find his footing in the world before too long, but special note that bears mentioning is Ciarán Hinds who is in great form as Radcliffe's new friend in town.

Hey, I didn't even mind their Twilight features. Well, I can't speak for them, but if you're looking for a good book with smart writing, a decent plot, and a touch of erotica, well, keep on going.

By the end of the book, I had a better insight into my whole family and most of the people I work with.  This book is a fascinating tour of the research on how different introverts and extroverts really are - and yet how they can work so well together.<br /><br />What Cain has done here, and why this book is so well-written, is pull together a wonderful mixture of university research, interviews with dozens of people, and her own life experiences. I never felt like I was being bogged down in boring details of some 1,000+ page research paper or that this was simply some gathering of anecdotal evidence.  It is apparent that Cain did her research, laid out the work in a logical and easy to follow manner, and created a book that should be required reading in college sociology courses.<br /><br />Usually I skip around in non-fiction books, but found myself reading every chapter of this one.<br /><br />Fascinating reading - highly recommended.
0345803485|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey is a well written book that makes you want to continiuosly keep reading even after the last page. No wonder this book is one of the New Yorks Times best seller. I can't wait to read the sequel.
B001CDWFPC|4.0|I have had a hard copy of the ESV Study Bible for a couple years, and I just recently purchased the kindle edition. I was a little nervous about how it would look, and I was pleased to see that the kindle edition is pretty nifty on my Kindle Touch.<br /><br />Many reviewers have complained about navigation, but they appear not to have read the directions. Searching the index can take you pretty quickly to any verse--if you remember the 2 or 3-digit abbreviation for the book title. Most of the time I guess correctly, but sometimes I end up in Joshua when I meant to go to John. At any rate, read the directions, which are right at the beginning the first time you open the book.<br /><br />To get a feel for the navigation, download Crossway's ESV Bible for your kindle. That's free, and the basic navigation using the index works about the same.<br /><br />As I expected, the charts and maps don't always look too good. Lack of color makes a big difference. If I really want to look at an image, I generally will just wait until I'm near my hard copy or go online (the online ESV bible has all features of the ESV Study Bible, though all are not unlocked unless you create an account and show proof of purchase of a print version).<br /><br />Another downside is the fact that, at least on the Kindle Touch, the book is so big that there can be a few second delay when, for example, using the \\"go to\\" button. As with many kindle books, I find that creating my own bookmarks can speed up navigation quite a bit.<br /><br />The verse-by-verse notes are indicated by a symbol (e.g., a little cross goes to the Study Bible notes, superscript numbers for footnotes to the text, superscript letters for cross-references). I find these notations to be a little intrusive when just trying to read the text, interrupting the flow of the reader a bit. But (1) the links work well, with easily marked \\"back\\" links that take you back to the text, (2) I don't know else it could be done, and (3) if you arejust trying to read a chapter or 2 without using the notes, then use the free non-study bible version, which gives a much smoother read.<br /><br />I'd give 5-stars for a print version. I deduct one star for the problems noted, which are more inherent in kindle format than in this particular book.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This has great devotional plans to choose from! Gives reminder options & interacts w/FB & Twitter! Needs to interact w/Google +. Sometimes slows down my other systems though :(
0143121006|1.0|The \\"meat\\" of this book was 25%....the Fluff - 75%.  It was like reading a story about a dog chasing it's tail.  A \\"few\\" facts, expanded into a book, does not necessarily make for a good read.  Very depressing reading, even tho I knew from the start there would be no resolvement.  If you like the Black Dahlia stories, you might like this one, but the Black Dahlia has much more \\"meat\\" in the stories.

B000002QWD|3.0|Bought it hoping that it will come with many Christmas songs so that we can play it over and over again during the holidays. However, after I received it and played it, I felt the song selections are limited, the CD does not have as many popular songs as I expected.

0780020685|5.0|I was really excited when I finally found this DVD!  This movie gives one a glimpse of what it meant to be a true samurai and to serve those in need.  Although the days of the samurai have long gone, this movie brings them back again.  There is just enough development of character in the movie that you do become attached to whats going on. Seven Samurai is a great example of Kurusawa's early masterpeices!  I love it!

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I was never looking for a happily ever after, I don't mind reading sad and depressing books. The thing that bothered me about the last book is that it was anticlimactic, the book was filled with the war promo filler and Katniss's haunting memories and guilt. I got that, war is traumatic..the games are traumatic but page after page after page? Just seems like filler to me. Like the author didn't even really know what direction exactly she was taking. You knew from the very beginning that Katniss wouldn't choose Gale because of the lack of character interaction. It was extremely predictable. Speaking of character interaction, I was enraged by the lack of ALL character interaction, like another reviewer had said, the characters all took on a paper doll feeling to them. Primrose death was just thrown in to solidify that Katniss could never be with Gale because of the correlation between the bomb that Gale helped make and Prims death. Seems cheap. This would be a one star book if the previous books had not been so good.
B0086700CM|4.0|Awesome game. Very addictive. Really easy. Has a tutorial . I. really like this game. I got it a week ago and I am still trying to unlock some acheivements. Running game.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Saw the author, E.L. James in an interview on The View and she gave the appearance of hiding behind a wig and glasses and ashamed of what she wrote. Who would be proud of such porno that only would be out of a sick school kid's imagination?  The publisher could only see profit.  Disgusting to all concerned!

B007N0REX6|5.0|This is by far one of the best albums I have purchased in years! Myles Kennedy paired with Slash is pure genius along with the songwriting. I was never a huge Slash fan but this album has changed my mind. The guitar work is absolutely amazing and fluid. Myles Kennedy is not only great in Alter Bridge but his vocals just ring through on this album. If you like just good solid rock and roll you will love this album along with the great groove it has. Don't hesitate to pick this up, you will not regret it.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this app its so awesome its my favorite app on kindle fire ive been waiting for this app to come out on kindle for a long time.
B007ZKY7XO|5.0|I pre-ordered Magic Hour, and was a little skeptical while reading the initial, mixed reviews. Even the sound clips weren't entirely convincing that it would be as fantastic as Night Hour. No need to worry. It's awesome, and people need to be less critical. There is no other group out there that can deliver their fans two feel-good albums (Party Albums) in two consecutive summers. Hats off to the only group that can jump-start your summer and make you feel totally alive.<br /><br />One thing that comes to mind is that Shady Love was released back in January. It's a great track, and blew me away at the time. Therefore, when you hear it again on the album, it doesn't blow your mind a second time, cause you have played it to death the past few months. For anyone that has not heard Shady Love, you are in for a real treat when Let's Have a Kiki flows into Shady Love. Anyone with a brain and a heart should be on their feet and reaching for the volume control, cranking it up and kicking off your shoes.<br /><br />Even though their are many styles on this album, it is still a consistent, enjoyable party album of the same caliber as Night Work. The production is crisp, with lots of creative touches that take multiple listenings to truly appreciate.<br /><br />Put your critical pencil behind your ear and cut loose and enjoy some good music!
0060936223|4.0|Like so many other fans of Patti Smith's music, I was really looking forward to reading this book. I got to it a little late, but I have much to say on the subject now.<br /><br />For what it's worth, I think \\"Just Kids\\" contains some very beautiful writing, particularly Patti's depiction of her youth and her longing for something bigger, something more beautiful and certainly something more poetic than the prospect of becoming a working class hero who never gets out. She sets just the right tone for all of that pent up but diffused artistic energy that so many young people feel. Oh do I remember those feelings!<br /><br />My problem with the book is all the whitewashing and sugarcoating she engages in. I understand nostalgia, but I don't care for dishonesty. I am a born and bred New Yorker who was hanging out in the East Village and at the clubs in the late '70's. Patti Smith was tough and wildly ambitious. She was most certainly not a 'tender apple blossom' who knew nothing of smoking, drinking, drugging, fornicating, etc. She and Robert both knew how to work it.<br /><br />At times I was ready to read that she'd brought along her smelling salts to ward off all the crass ambition that she, the eternal innocent poet, was encountering. Nothing wrong with ambition and even some less than sterling behavior, just own up. I actually ended up liking Robert more for precisely those reasons - it seems he had no qualms about getting where he got. I might go to Patricia Morrisroe's bio of him next.<br /><br />I'm giving the book four stars because of the quality of the storytelling and beautiful imagery, but remain disappointed at the lack of a more bracing honesty. I reckon that's why they're called memoirs - it's all in the eye and heart of the re-teller.
B005KPL7WK|5.0|Hold on to your ear-buds!!! I can't begin to describe the warmth felt in this artist's poetry and melody. I first heard him on an episode of house. I immediately googled it and tracked down Ben Howard. If you want a taste of how awesome he sings and plays guitar, check out youtube and listen to the songs \\"further away\\" and \\"promise\\". WOW is this kid freakin great and talented!!!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I don't usually write reviews, but I feel compelled to in this case. This book is so poorly written I can not, for the life of me, figure out how it has become a best seller. The plot is boring, there is no character development, and the language is stale. I'm not an avid reader; I read for pleasure when I have time, which is rare. This book has made me realize that I am a literary snob. Yes, the sex at first is hot but even it becomes repetitive. I am hoping the next book I pick up has no eye rolling, lip biting, of references to spanking.  I can guarantee I will not be purchasing the rest of this series. Laters, baby.
B00881VLCE|3.0|Not a bad app, but the UI needs work. The pieces are hard to grab and the last piece is even worse.
1423140591|5.0|The book was great! The humor Riordan used in the Percy Jackson series was still there. I loved the way each of the three main characters got their own chapters so you could see there point of view. Cant wait for the \\"Mark of Athena\\" to come out!
B007WFR1MQ|3.0|Fear Factory's \\"Mechanize\\" was one of the best albums of 2010, and showed a clear career resurgence from the then reunited parties of Dino Cazares and programmer/producer Rhys Fulber with career weirdo/super talent Burton Bell. Add to that the drum talents of the great Gene Holgan, and you had a winning combination. The album was extremely aggressive, and clearly illustrated that the parties involved were not only passionate about the album, but had the will and way to turn that passion into a bunch of of catchy, hard-hitting tunes.<br /><br />Fast forward to their next release, \\"The Industrialist\\", and we find that only Burton and Dino have made the trip, replacing some-might-call-legendary drummer Gene Holgan with a drum machine. However, at first glance, not much has changed. The opening track storms out of the gate with the same piss and vinegar found in most of \\"Mechanize\\", and we are certainly off to a good start. The chorus feels big and catchy, and hopes are high that we are in for a treat. This feeling remains after passing through track two(also the albums first single), \\"Recharger\\". Showing the \\"other\\" side of Fear Factory, this song keeps up some aggression, but puts on full display Bell's emotional and powerful clean vocal stylings, delivered in yet another catchy chorus. The album seems poised to join \\"Mechanize\\" and exceed what would be lofty expectations.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the promise of the first two tracks does not even come close to being matched by any of their followers. Although track three, \\"New Messiah\\", is strong, it feels flat next to the first two, and is definitely the closest thing to competent from that point on. The rest of the album is littered in mid-era Fear Factory, delivering some aggressive verse riffs, but ultimately falling flat with choruses that are simply not memorable. And for all of the great album closers Fear Factory has unleashed over their career, the long pseudo-instrumental piece that is given on \\"The Industrialist\\" can only be viewed as disappointing, at best.<br /><br />While I could spend time reviewing each of the middle tracks on the album and talking about them individually, I just don't see much point. The formula is simply repeated over and over, with slight variations, but nothing even coming close to the songwriting quality found on the albums opening salvo of songs. I'm honestly surprised at the relatively high reviews this album has been receiving so far - I cant for a second put this album in the same category as Mechanize, or any of the other Fear Factory classics. At this point, this album offers little but two songs to add to a playlist on Itunes, and the cd will probably end up on the shelf. Heres hoping the third time is a charm for this reunited(term used loosely) and often strong entity known as Fear Factory.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I enjoy this game. It is fun. I like it. it is very easy to play.  this game is cool
B007RKPO84|5.0|This album has received a large amount of critical acclaim since release, and due to the fact that this is very deserved, I wont spend much time breaking this album down in parts. While \\"Hordes of Chaos\\" was an enjoyable, if not inconsistent, album and effort, \\"Phantom Antichrist\\" does everything it can to absolutely overpower its predecessor, and a large amount of older Kreator albums as well.<br /><br />This is a band that knows exactly who they are and what they want, and have the will and confidence to create something that not only defies expectations, but shatters them. The overall songwriting quality is through the roof, providing catchy and inspired music from the opening notes to the end riff. Album highlights include the title track, the absolutely barn burning \\"Death to the World\\", and the emotionally evocative and supremely catchy \\"The Few, the Proud, the Broken\\".<br /><br />Singling out individual tracks too much would be a disservice, however, as this album holds up throughout its nine official songs(and one intro). One thing to note while listening is the guitar work - from the riffs to the solos(particularly), the band has upped the ante and the album becomes an absolute shred-fest in parts, adding yet another element to the bands ridiculous arsenal of weapons that make this such a strong offering.<br /><br />All in all, this album has the feeling of a \\"modern classic\\", and would be highly recommended to any fans of Kreator, thrash, or just metal in general. Theres something for everyone in this collection of big, epic metal tunes, and through the use of intelligently written lyrics and more chaotic and skilled guitar work, this album seems set to rise above much of Kreators discography, and to the top of many \\"best of\\" lists by the years end.<br /><br />Thank you, Kreator. May I have another?
B005OGYH90|4.0|Of course well all know about Slash's career with Guns N Roses, the Slash's Snakepit project and Velvet Revolver but as a solo artist this is Slash's first full length live album. Lucky for us fans it works as a retrospective of his work thus far, right up until his solo debut in 2010 with an obvious emphasis on his \\"Slash\\" album and classic Guns N Roses material. After the solo album Slash went on tour with Myles Kennedy (Alter Bridge) who sang on the album and it seems that in Myles Slash has found the perfect partner who can sing just about everything and who completes him very well. I didn't know what to think at first because I wasn't all that familiar with Kennedy but after hearing Live In Stoke it's obvious that he was the ideal choice of singer and I must admit the guy's vocal pipes are impressive. I can't imagine anyone doing what Myles does and I hope the two of them stick together for a while. Made In Stoke was recorded in Stoke, England Slash's birthplace and it was a special concert for him, his first time playing in Stoke, some of his family was there and this is a document of that. I only picked up Made In Stoke recently and I've been missing something, it's definitely one of the best live albums I've bought in a while and one of the modern day live releases.<br /><br />I was intrigued to see what songs Slash and his band would play, particularly from \\"Slash\\" since all the tracks had different singer it makes it interesting to see them performed by Myles. Well, Made In Stoke is an amazing performance and the setlist covers all of Slash's work. I love the energy of the newer songs live, Slash's solo album tracks are all excellent. I particularly love the versions of \\"Ghost\\" (one of my favorites from the 2010 album and has a killer riff) and \\"Back From Cali\\" which sounds particularly good in a live setting. \\"Starlight\\" was Myles' showcase on that album and he sounds great performing it live. I was amused and pleasantly surprised that \\"Dr.Alibi\\" made it here since it was sung by Lemmy Kilmister and I thought there's no way Myles can do justice do that song. Interestingly enough it's Slash's bassist, Tod Kerns, who handles the vocal duties on this one and he does a fantastic job at it too, a surprising moment for sure. \\"Beggars & Hangers On\\" was one of the coolest Snakepit tracks and this version rocks just as much, if not more.  There is only one Velvet Revolver song \\"Slither\\" and while I acknowledge it would have been cool if there was more VR material represented this tour had more of an emphasis on the new songs and classic Guns N Roses tracks that people will seemingly never get tired of hearing. The Guns songs are amazing because Myles Kennedy sings them with so much passion and energy and it doesn't end up sounding like a cover band. The crowd is the loudest on Guns N Roses tracks which makes it special and they are really into this concert from beginning to end and there really is a live vibe, it's real. It certainly feels so to me. \\"Sweet Child O' Mine\\" got one of the biggest reactions of course and the crowd sings every single word along it seems, but to me the best Guns songs they played were \\"Rocket Queen\\" and \\"Civil War\\". \\"Rocket Queen\\" is one of my very favorite GNR tracks and I was curious as to how Myles would do and I'm happy to say his delivery is nothing short of excellent. The riff is played to perfection and sounds heavy and there is a cool breakdown in which Slash does a little (well, not so little) solo part. \\"Civil War\\" is the slowest track here but is a very intense moment, the vocals are handled very well and it was a shining moment of the night. \\"Paradise City\\" closes the set, Slash starts out with this little guitar intro before Kennedy warns the audience :\\"we're going to the play one last song for you tonight...\\" and as soon as they hear the song's name and the intro it's on and the audience makes itself known and sing the chorus particularly loud and united!<br /><br />The only negativeI have to say is concerning the DVD; it has only five songs and it's not professional quality at all whereas hav ing the entire concert would have made this a must have and a sure five star.  It's still a nice look at the band onstage although a very brief one. I know in the UK the show was released full length on DVD and I think it should have been here too. You could also go for the ordinary edition without the DVD to save a few bucks.<br /><br />Live In Stoke is a very nice package consisting of two CDs of 21 songs, a DVD of five songs and neat liner notes by Malcom Dome (I must be one of the few who reads those but I really enjoyed them and Dome's account of both Slash and the show ), rock critic well known for his work in diverse rock magazines. The whole thing looks very cool with the artwork on both the cover and the CDs; I just wish the liner notes/poster would have fitted in a sleeve somewhere instead of just laying there with nothing to hold them. Yes, unfortunately the DVD is not the whole show as a lot of fans thought but I do not regret purchasing Made In Stoke. If you're a Slash/GNR fan you'd do well to pick this up those songs are played passionately and Myles Kennedy breathes a different life into them and the result is phenomenal and the sound is terrific throughout (There are parts where I thought he really sounded like Axl which was really cool. The way he sang all of those songs with different singers and still make each of them sound good is admirable.). 4/5I have to say is concerning the DVD; it has only five songs and it's not professional quality at all whereas hav ing the entire concert would have made this a must have and a sure five star.

B000GCFY0I|3.0|I purchased the entire series just based on the reviews on Amazon.  That was a huge mistake.  The series is ok.  This book is pretty detailed and I couldn't even get into it until about halfway through.  I usually don't continue to read something that takes that long to keep my interest but since I purchased it I sort of had to read it.  I won't read it again.
B000FCKGPC|1.0|Its tedious. But I keep on reading since Im hoping for some action same as in the first three books. By now Im almost through and am very dissapointed. Am not going for the fifth book. Whats the point since the reviews say its more of the same on and on and no action? The author got stuck in his story and cant figure out how to end it. Its a pity. This fourth book should have been the last and ended with fireworks. Not just continuing with a flow of new boring characters that you have no chance of remembering anyway. Its just filler. There are so many other good books out there that I prefer to read instead of the next in the series. I hope you have patience if you buy this and the next and apparently also the sixth. Good luck.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|First than all this is a good science fiction movie. It has the principal questions than any \\"good\\" scifi movie has to have: Where are we coming from? What are we? and Why? Packed with an excellent photography (CGI?) and a good action pace.<br />It's not a terror movie but there are some terror scenes. And of course It is not an Alien movie which is good because It's hard to imagine another plot with Aliens all over the place. Nevertheless there is a conection and some clarification to the first Alien which is thanked (or should it be).<br /><br />It isn't perfect but is good enough as to make you want more!!<br />The best character, no doubt about it: the android.<br /><br />Probably some edition would have been good but all in all a good movie.

B0013TTLDE|5.0|I cannot say enough about Kate Morton's books! Her ability to transport the reader to another time and place is limitless. Every time I start a book I don't want to stop. I fall in love with the characters and feel as if I'm back in time watching their lives before my very eyes. Her books are the type that when you aren't reading them you are thinking g about them. And that makes it a good book. If you ask me.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I am sure Prometheus is a kind of a movie, that will be recognized as a classic after many years. Like blade runner. Its a testament of Scott's ability to create great Sci-fi..I wouldnt say, its better than Alien (or worse) cause in my opinion, its a common flaw for most people to make the comparison! Granted ALIEN was more scary, but that is not the point..Prometheus is meant to be a key movie..It unlocks mysteries from the first motion picture, and creates others.. Deep Character development is also pointless, why mumbling and mumbling endlessly. ( I wont explain that cause i will reveal a major spoiler!! - you ll find it out your selves!!)<br /><br />Technically is perfect. The details (inside the ship - on the planet etc) are jaw dropping. Performances are good. Music is block buster material, but the absence of Jerry Goldsmith is obvious. And that is my only problem.<br /><br />Saw it here two days ago (Greece). You guys from the States are in for a treat, literally!! Happy screening!<br /><br />Cant wait for the Blu-Ray :)
B0052VUNHC|1.0|Quality literature develops a plot and characters that engage the readers and takes them along for the ride.<br /><br />This attempt at literature has neither plot or endearing characters. The 4 main players in the story are shallow, egocentric, narcissistic and controlling. They demonstrate poor behavioral choices with the absence of consequences.<br />It is a study in abnormal psychology.<br /><br />I have lost my faith in using the Amazon review process.

0307950689|2.0|I have read all of Dan Brown's books. Over all, I can say I was pretty satisfied. Digital Fortress being my personal pick as the snoozer, and Angel & Demons my favorite. After Reading both the Davinci Code and Angels & Demons, I expected far more from Robert Langdon via Dan Brown than I got. Several times I had to make myself pick up the book and keep reading. There were many chapters I had to slog through. Most of The Lost Symbol was predictable. As if this formula is the only one Dan Brown knows. But by the time I got to the ending, I was thoroughly disgusted. It was not an ending worthy of the Robert Langdon character, or really related to the tantalizing title of \\"The Lost Symbol\\". This book literally leads you to believe you will be reading something else and you will just fall into it and be mesmerized. It never happened. This is a typical mystery, with a slight twist at the end which actually made the entire mess of this book SUCK. I am so disappointed. The first thing I decided to do was write a review. I just finished the book 5 minutes ago and was THAT disenchanted. This is the first time I wish I could have my money back. Come on Dan! If you are going to write another Langdon book, make it truly about symbols or something similarly interesting. Not family angst and drama that leads the reader to an unfulfilled conclusion that includes the Masons AGAIN. Dan Brown is a good writer, he just seemed to lose his mojo with this one. Sorry Dan, but I can only give you two stars.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|if you forget the hateful hollywood-buzz, the box-office bomb, and allow yourself to be drawn in, carried along, fascinated, enchanted, and entertained by this flick, you'll be rewarded.  the writing, storyline, direction, acting, production values, cinematography, prduction design, special effects, action, in short, EVERYTHING about this flick is grade AA: it is based upon characters with whom you can empathize and sympathize; the FX factor never over-rides the story -- this is about people (and aliens) who feel, think, act.<br />unfortunately, this flick was badly marketed and had NO fan-boy backup:  unlike AVENGERS (which had fan-boys drooling over all the comics from which the material was sourced; and, joss wheddon, the fan-boy-geek icon of comic.con) JOHN  CARTER had to stand on it's own merrits; it DOES, with class and flair.<br />i can say, unequivocally, if you try this flick, you'll find it interesting, moving, entertaining; please, give it a chance.

B005LCECU6|4.0|Song Selection - This CD contains selections from 2 concerts from Cleveland.  Tracks 1-12 are from 1974.  Tracks 13-15 are from 1975.  There are a few rare gems on this album that make it note worthy for fans.<br /><br />Performance - I am not going to compare this concert to others.  You already know what to expect if you are Rush fans.  What is interesting about the '74 concert is that you see Rush at the early stage of their career playing blues rock songs that rely more on groove, than technical prowess (a part of their career I personally feel is underrated).  A young, energetic rock band out to prove themselves to the music world.  Neil Peart having just joined the band, is in his infancy of developing his trademark solos and putting his own spin and feel on Rush's first album.  And on \\"Working Man\\" we hear parts of By-Tor and the Snow Dog 4 months before they would record Fly By Night.  And if I had a dollar for every \\"Yah!\\" Geddy belted out...<br /><br />Sound Quality - This is why my rating is 4 stars and not 5. The person who mixed the recording back in the 70's must have been on an acid trip.  Many times during guitar solos the signal pans back and forth between speakers and it becomes gimmicky and annoying.  But it was a sign of the times (like dorky Steve Miller sound effects).  Also the 3 tracks from the '75 concert sound muffled and compressed, which is a letdown after hearing a superior sounding recording from '74.  A side effect from this era is that Geddy's bass sound does not have enough punch or bottom end. Instead it's all midrange and treble. Like their debut album, his bass gets lost in the mix.  That is a shame, considering one of the reasons I purchased the CD was the hope that I could finally hear better sounding bass on those debut tracks from that era.
B0086700CM|5.0|i think it gets u frustrated but then it gets addicting and you get better and better at it the more you play it
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am impressed.  I have to admit if you feel a little uncomfortable talking about, thinking about or having sex then this is not the book for you.  Shut down your computer and don't order, but if you like to read a book that may spice up your love life then click purchase.  Granted this book has more sexual explicit scenes than any book I've read before, but it's what's written between those scenes that got me so addicted.  I've actually read the series twice and the second time I skimmed over the sexual content to get to the actual story.  It really is written well and you can't help but get intrigued by the back story that follows Grey and Anna's desire to pull him away from it.  This is not only a romance, it has some mystery and tense moments that leave you on edge.  These books are rather long, so I recommend starting reading it early because it is very hard to put down and you will find yourself taking Grey to bed with you. After reading you'll find yourself wanting to take your husband to bed with you!
B0086700CM|5.0|the best game ever I was so exited when it came out for the kindle fire best game if u like action
B003UYUP6M|5.0|I have read half of this book and find it fantastic and very attractive. Not only it tells you how Google is developing, but some insight for managing a tech startup.
B0086700CM|5.0|its a great game. it can be very entertaining. you may collect coins to upgrade and it has a variety of characters to choose from. i was addicted to this game and it FREE!!!
B003CU16D0|5.0|Received the book on time, good condition and I would order from same company in the future.<br /><br />I have seen the movie on TV and had to have the book. The book is large print and easy reading and I can't wait to begin reading.
B00792EGES|5.0|I'm not surprised how good is this concert considering how good is the band. The set list is great and executed to perfection. Lasers and flames give a striking visual effect to the concert but I would enjoy this band even in darkness. RECOMMENDED
B0074VTHKM|3.0|This particular series may be written for young adults, but  I really enjoy it and I'm in my 70's! I love Grisham and his legal mysteries.  I look forward to the next one!
B002RSDW80|5.0|I saw this movie in the theatre and of course loved it (how can you not love it with Meryl Streep, Amy Adams, and even Stanley Tucci?).  My 80 year old father has Macular Degeneration (the kind you can't do anything about) and is loosing his eye sight.  Living in Georgia (USA) he loves all things SEC football and movies galore!  We discovered recently an amazing service that is called Descriptive Video Service (DVS).  Basically this means that there is a full voice over of the movie, almost like someone is reading the screen play for you.  The first time we discoved it was in watching The Help, and it was what I call simply AMAZON amazing!!!!  We didn't have to stop the movie every other second to answer one question after another!!!  He went from asking what was literally over 100 questions each movie to clarifying one thing in the middle and that was it.  Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.....we could breathe easy and watch the movie in relative peace and joy.  So now, I search each time I can for a new movie that has DVS and purchase it at Amazon.  Julie and Julia has this service (you find it where the subtitles are under language in set up).  We watched it Mother's Day weekend and both my parents went on and on about what a great movie it was and what a Godsend (literally) the DVS service is.  So, thank you DVS powers that be, and Amazon for allowing us to enjoy for the first time in years a movie, and now eight!  Just make sure you have a snack ready while viewing Julie and Julia as it will make you hungry for sure.  Ha!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|have htc and fire ... takes a while to accumulate coins and acorns.... but fun to build and doesn't take a lot of time
B006L4MWVE|2.0|I read the book before I even knew there was a movie, and I'm glad I did. The book was very good but the movie doesn't have the time to go into the back-stories of the characters and maybe that's why it left me feeling kind of \\"flat\\". I wouldn't recommend this movie unless you've read the book and just want to see a movie version.
0879309210|2.0|Not a whole lot of technical info and too much about this or that artists guitar or someones opinion instead of providing good concise technical info and how too information.<br /><br />A reasonable read but as I said a bit lite on technical content.<br />Also a bit pushy on this or that Stew Mac tool instead of real how to info. For example there was a little info on two versions of roller nuts which were used on Fender Strats for a while, I've never seen any, but not a single word roller style Tune-O-Matic bridges which are very prevalent.<br /><br />Overall too much content on Fender Strats and Gibson makes and not enough on general setups to be of use to the general public or owners of other brands. A bit about Floyd Rose guitars too but very thin to non existent on other makes like Gretsch, Guild, Ibanez etc. etc.<br /><br />I guess it's also a good sales piece for super glue if you're a fan of the stuff.<br />Overall, if you happen to own a Fender Strat or one of it's copies, then jump on it, if not keep shopping.
1609611543|4.0|He talks about real people who went gluten free, and changes that have occurred in the wheat industry. He includes gluten testing information. He charts out 7 days of eating wheat free, and includes recipes.<br /><br />I think the fact that he is an MD is a plus. Too many doctors won't diagnose gluten intolerance.<br /><br />It might be a little radical telling people not to eat carbs.<br />I think carbs in moderation is a good thing--gluten-free carbs.<br />He recommends using almond flour and coconut flour instead of the usual GF flour and starches. Included in this book are a few recipes using the flours, like one for Banana-Blueberry Muffins, Ginger Spice Cookies, and Carrot Cake. (Almond and Coconut Flours are very expensive ingredients.)<br /><br />What I don't like is that artificial sweeteners are recommended.<br />I prefer natural sugar, but then I'm not diabetic.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|So I read a lot of erotica, (kindle makes it easily accessible) So when I heard that an erotic novel was a best seller I was happy because it was coming into the mainstream instead of being the 'dirty novel shoved underneath your bed' or whatever. However I had much higher hopes for his book. I thought it would be at least an interesting read. Nope. This is basically just a lot of bland and semi amusing sex scenes strung together with way too much talk about her 'inner goddess'. Seriously every other page was another reference to it. There isn't that much of actual BDSM sex scenes, most of it is vanilla sex, however there are two or three really kinky things.<br /><br />Now what a lot of people don't know is that this was actually a Twilight fan fiction entitled 'Master of The Universe' that was turned into a book in order to turn a profit. Which is why the price is so expensive and not likely to change, the price was set by the publisher. And the publisher forked out in the seven digits to get the rights, so I am assuming you won't be seeing a discount anytime soon. You can still see a lot of Twilight references and similarities in the book, though they did try to tweak some things about it to make it look like it's own work (didn't work very well). The names have changed (Jacob is now Jose... Really?), some of the little details have changed, but all the personalities are pretty much identical to twilight.<br /><br />I gave this two stars because despite the fact that the book was published only to make money, and despite the fact that the writing itself makes me cringe with every page. It's a strangely addicting read. The plot is dull when you look at the surface: Good, overly innocent girl meets mysterious, dark, twisted, sexually experienced guy with a lot of money and the girl falls for him. When you actually delve into the plot you can see it's not much better. But again, strangely addicting read, probably because I identify way too easily with the main character because our lives were identical when this book started. (Seriously, I even work at a hardware store... So where's my billionaire???) Moving on, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone especially newbies into erotica. It's really just that bad, you can read a lot of free erotica if you have a kindle and search the free best sellers. The freebies are a better read any way, this is just smut.
B001TOD92C|2.0|I ordered this DVD and while it played okay the case it came in was really screwed up and the jacket had puncture marks all over it.  I wasn't really happy with this as it said nothing of the sort of how it looked.  While this probably shouldn't be that big of a deal, I basically had to throw the old case away and tape up the jacket cover.  needless to say, it looks pretty bad.  :(
B007ZRZF8I|1.0|not worth it at all!  rip off!  not stating up front that you include open feint in the app is just wrong
0345803485|1.0|I do not understand why this book if so popular.The sex scenes are fun at first, especially if you've never read anything like that. But even that part gets bad very quickly. I'll spare the details in this review about that as it has already been said in multiple other reviews.<br /><br />What bugs me the most is Christian Grey as the romantic hero. He's crazy hot. He's only 26 and a self made billionaire, he flies, apparently is a sex god, is supposedly really smart, a pianist, fluent in French, and probably a dozen other \\"dreamy\\" things.... but he's a jerk. A big fat jealous, controlling, possesive jerk. I feel bad for his early life and how much it sucked, sure. But that doesn't excuse his current behavior. The main character, Ana, references his stalking tendencies multiple times...that is NOT cute or romantic! He creates files on all his girls, looks up their social security numbers, spies on Ana, and all other crazy things. And he is controlling to the point of where I would consider him emotionally abusive. She has to ask his permission to do things? When she \\"disobeys\\" him, she ends up apologizing to him for upsetting him, she's constantly walking on egg shells around him trying not to upset his temper...gah! How on earth are other girls swooning over this crap?

B007J4T2G8|3.0|I suppose that writing a review will necessitate cutting myself up into two parts. One part of me is a reader, reading for the hell of it. The other part of me is a reader that's seen so many better books.<br /><br />If you think about it,  I think the appeal of this thing lies in the perverse perfection of Christian Grey, along of course with the erotic aspect of the work. His personality appeals because there's some part of us that craves the same perfection (note, the perfection, not the perversity).<br /><br />Still, I find lots of trouble with the way the characters were portrayed, especially Ana Steele. She's 21, naive and a virgin, then she suddenly meets Christian and turns into some sort of willing slave (bad term, I know,) ostensibly in an attempt to help fix him what with his broken childhood. As for the perfection I mentioned above, Christian is just too perfect (on the surface - what with the billionaire/super skills) and then just too perverse as well. It's a troubling combination.<br /><br />I suppose, again, that the 'fixing' attempt is a part of the appeal, something about doing everything for the person you love. Yet, if you think about it, I think most of the women in the world would be hard-pressed to love someone with a personality like his. I find his so-called 'singular tastes' impossible to fall in love with.<br /><br />Some of the stuff in that contract is downright abusive. Canes? Seriously? Also, that bit about the crates is just downright disturbing. Writing-wise, I also find it somewhat flat, and if you think about it, there's not really much of a plot. Ordinarily, plotless things can be character driven (i.e. literary fiction) but we all know that this is the furthest cry from literary fiction imaginable.<br /><br />The other scenes also lack power, they're just there for the titillation. Everyone who agrees will understand what I mean. Anyway, that's pretty much my thoughts on the whole thing. It's just flat.<br /><br />I suppose the only thing I can respect is her guts for penning this thing, and that's it.nly thing I can respect is her guts for penning this thing, and that's it.

B001NLKT60|5.0|This is one of those books you cannot put down, make sure you don't have working the morning. Although part of a trilogy it is a complete story with one problem, you will want to start the next straight away<br />One other point the plot is so fast I cannot see them making a film of this one.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Curiousity is what drew me to this book - I kept seeing news articles about it being a \\"must-read\\" and a New York Times bestseller. Well, I didn't realize right away that it was in the category of erotic romance until I looked at the back cover of a print book. That was my first warning sign that it was going to get to the point that I would chose to read no further and delete the book off my Kindle.<br /><br />I liked the character of Anastasia Steele and was enjoying the story until Christian Grey reveals his sex torture room and need to sexually punish women and be sexually depraved. And the language got really bad. Sadly, Ms. James wrote a book based on selling sex, and a great book can survive without descriptive and disturbing sex scenes. She went too far. I could see that the book was going to continue to get more disturbing (this book is just pornography in print) so I decided to purchase another book with substance and a positive message.<br /><br />I wrote this review to hopefully save someone else $9.99.

0307951529|2.0|I was disappointed.  The book came across to me as a variation on Four Hour Work Week, where the focus is narrowed to low start-up cost and all the useful, actionable tips are sucked out.  There is less substance here than in Four Hour Work Week. If you are completely new to thinking about entrepreneurship (e.g. if you haven't read any business books before), then it may be useful to you. And many of the concepts in the book are told through the eyes of an internet marketer, which was a turn-off to me.<br /><br />Rather than real substance, the book is sprinkled with filler and vapid thoughts (e.g. from page 247: \\"Sometimes the best advice is none at all. If you know what you need to do, the next step is simply to do it\\").<br /><br />If you need a pep talk to get you started, you may find the book useful.  However, the price of the book is more than 10% of a $100 startup. My suggestion is to save that money and put it toward your startup.
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|I really like this CD. I'm also a big fan of My December which I know did not get great reviews but it is another woman power CD that I love from Kelly. I'm happily married but sometimes you just have to have a Kelly concert on the way to work in the morning.
0345803507|5.0|I purchased this series upon the recommendation of a friend. I could not believe how well this author developed the characters in each successive book. Yes, this series is not the \\"usual\\" romance read--this is what makes it special. The only problem I had with these books is that I turned the last page...it was over, and I want more!<br /><br />What I find astonishing is that people completely trashed the work of this author! Had I listened to all of the silly negative reviews (I question if some of these people actually read the series) I probably would have missed out on an astonishingly great read. I just hope that all of the NASTY things people have said about this series of books will not keep E.L. James from writing more!
0783229526|4.0|My husband saw this movie and thought I would love it. It is very weird to me but there are some funny parts and I'm a Depp fan and I think he did a good job acting but all I can say is good thing it was cheap :) My husband is happy with the purchase....
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Walter Isaacson's biography of Steve Jobs was unencumbered by Steve Job's editing eye.... in fact Jobs didn't want to even see it as it progressed, and the only editing that Jobs insisted on was the cover art for the book.  I found the work nicely written and it flowed smoothly and logically.  I never found it laborious or tedious as some have, and actually relished every opportunity to read it whenever I could.  It's surprising to learn of the hard-edged treatment of subordinates that characterized much of Steve's treatment of co-workers.  But if he thought your were talented, he was a great supporter.  It's interesting and stimulating and revealing of both the vulnerability and the talent of Steve Jobs.  When you're finished, you really feel that you have a decent understanding of the man.  I now want to read more of Isaacson's works.

B007OWG3LM|4.0|This band is so unique and enchanting. I have always just gone along on the journey and felt it would be inappropriate if not presumptuous to judge or critique.  I almost can't believe I'm giving this latest album 4 stars instead of 5.  I don't think this would be the right starting point to begin an acquaintance with their music.  Personally I have a great fondness for the one with the long title and the cover photo of the naked guys hopping over the fence, because that was my first SR album.  Also the music on that CD is a little more melodic, less meandering.<br /><br />The music on Valtari is occasionally more electronified - not offensively so, but it makes me wistful for that scene in Hvarf/Heim where they are outside picking up pieces of slate for a makeshift xylophone.  The title tune itself is my least favorite.  It feels a little like forced outer space music.  In general, I am not feeling the same joy and exuberance from earlier albums, where I would be driving and listening, and all of a sudden I would be smiling.<br /><br />Having said that, the final track Fyogur piano is perhaps the most beautiful SR song ever - quiet, elegiac.  It brought tears to my eyes.<br /><br />I can't even imagine the creative soul that gives rise to music like this.  I am only recording my response.  There is still no other band like Sigur Ros, and I don't want to discourage anyone from giving this music a listen.

B007Y36K46|5.0|John Carter of Mars was brilliant! I think it is my new favorite film. It is the Fantasia of this generation for two very important reasons. One, it nearly bankrupted Disney due to its precision and artistic flare. Two, It is so far ahead of its time it was a box office failure.<br />The choice of Lynn Collins to play Deja was brilliant. She pulls this roll off. Kitsch, is far too young and inexperienced to play Carter. They needed Hugh Jackman, but Collins screen presence makes it all worthwhile.<br />My other complaint is the androgynous Tharks, but it couldn't get its PG13 rating if they were depicted as written. Six breasted green aliens would have been brilliant in 3d. Why do all movie aliens have an English accent? It isn't needed and I find it annoying. Yes it adds a some tone to a character, but they didn't make John Carter sound like he was fresh from a cotillion. On the subject of accents, Disney failed on the Tharks as well. Just because Michael Dorn made a fantastic 80's klingon doesn't make all stalwart aliens inherently of African descent. Ja Ja binks was also shadowed. I did however like the animation of the Tharks on their steeds; if you are a fan of Heavy Metal you can see this film pays homage.<br />But even with all these stereotypes the movie was fantastic. Disney went the extra mile without sacrificing artistic vision for coin.

B007SGM084|2.0|After reading some of the reviews I would have liked to purchase the triology but the price for the downloads for this set and almost all the other kindle choices are now more expensive that the paperbacks.  It really is too much money for a download.  I realize that the Author needs to be paid but my guess is the Publishers are making some serious profit off the downloads as well as the paperbacks.  There should be a lower price as they are not using ink or paper and their proofreaders are not doing that great a job as there are many mistakes in quite a few of these books.  I have a few books in my wishlist but the cost is really prohibitive.  I will be watching how much I will be spending on my Kindle from  now on.

0439023491|4.0|If you enjoy novels that are action-packed, romantic, and unpredictable, then you will definitely be enthralled by Suzanne  Collins's book, Catching Fire. I highly suggest this novel because of how unpredictable the plot was. Since it is a sequel to another book, I figured that I would have a pretty good idea of what would happen; I was certainly wrong. The new arena of the Quarter Quell made it so the annual Hunger Games was bound to be action-packed and even more dangerous than ever. The new characters that are introduced in this sequel completely alter the plot because of the impact they have on the Capitol, Katniss, and the rebellion waiting to happen. With all of these new additions to the series, the novel is even better than the one it follows.<br /><br />  Catching Fire is the second book in The Hunger Games trilogy by Suzanne Collins. Though it seemed almost impossible, Katniss Everdeen won the Hunger Games alongside her tribute partner, Peeta Mellark. Everyone had expected Katniss to be happy and relieved since she was now reunited with her family and her best friend, Gale. Katniss and Peeta went back to their normal lives trying to forget all that they experienced during the Games. They stopped pretending to be the `star crossed lovers' that they convinced the viewers to believe they were. President Snow soon finds out that Katniss and Peeta were faking being in love, in order to have a reason to rebel against the capitol. President Snow threatens to kill Katniss's sister, Prim, if Katniss cannot fully convince the Capitol and everyone watching the games that she is in love with Peeta. Suzanne Collins's main thesis for the novel is that even though Katniss gave hope of a rebellion, President Snow is willing to do anything to show that he will always be more powerful than any winning tribute of the Hunger Games.<br /><br />  The author's purpose for writing Catching Fire is to show how kids in the twenty-first century view war and how we handle it being a part of our world. Suzanne Collins wrote The Hunger Games feeling the same way she felt when she would hear about her father fighting in the Vietnam War. The idea of the plot came when she was channel surfing between two programs; one being a reality television show and the other being young adults fighting each other. This inspired her to combine the two stories and make the teenagers fight each other to the death in a dangerous arena thus creating the plot for the Hunger Games series.<br /><br />  The author makes a huge point that President Snow is always striving to scare everyone into knowing that he cannot be defeated or overpowered. This year in the novel is the 75th annual Hunger Games which means there will be a twist to the game rules. President Snow twisted the Games by having all the past victors become tributes once again. Even though this makes the Capitol mad at President Snow because of their attachment to the victors, it proved to all the people and to the Capitol that he would always have ultimate power. Another example of Snow's overwhelming amount of power is when he visits Katniss at her home in District 12 and threatens her sister Prim's life. He tells her that she needs to convince not only the Capitol, but himself included that she is completely in love with Peeta. She needs to display her affections towards him on the victory tour before the actual Games or else President Snow will kill Prim and her mother. This shows that President Snow knows every person's weaknesses and how to use them against the people. Katniss's weakness is obviously her sister, and Snow is completely using Prim against Katniss in order to get what he wants.<br /><br />  Since Katniss doesn't want to lose her sister, she chooses to do what Snow commands.  During the victory tour, she has no contact with Gale so that no one suspects any feelings that she might have for him. Throughout the tour, she acts `lovey-dovey' towards Peeta to convince everyone that she is in love with him. Peeta soon finds out that Katniss is faking and decides to help her by proposing to her in order to add to the charade. Even after all of this, President Snow is still not convinced that Peeta and Katniss love each other. Therefore, he puts them both back into the Games to fight to the death against each other and all the other past victors.<br /><br />  This novel does not actually have an official argument since it is a fictional book with unrealistic things that happen. Since the concept of the Games has never happened during our times, there is not really way for the author to convince me that it could happen one day. Having 24 teenagers being put in an arena to fight until the death is not likely to happen today because that is not how our world operates. When President Snow pulls the Quarter Quell twist for the Games from the box he says, \\"On the 75th anniversary, as a reminder to rebels that even the strongest among them cannot overcome the power of the Capitol, the male and female tributes will be reaped from their existing pool of victors\\" (Collins, 172). This passage explains how this year's Games are going to operate and how Snow is in full power over all of his people.<br /><br />  The Hunger Games trilogy, Catching Fire in particular, greatly compares to the novel 1984. Both novels do not allow rebellions among the people if they want to fight against the system. Big Brother is very similar to President Snow in that they both have eyes and ears watching everything you do and say. Similar to the telescreens in 1984, President Snow has cameras set up in each district to make sure no one is planning rebellions. The only difference is that people are fully aware of the telescreens in 1984, but no one finds out about the cameras until later in the novel. Both the Capitol and Big Brother use peoples' weaknesses against them in order to stop them from rebelling against the system. Winston and Katniss both became rebellion leaders by accident. Winston started a rebellion because he fell in love with a woman; Katniss started a rebellion by saving Peeta in the first novel by having them both become victors rather than one of them dying. Winston and Katniss are also similar because they are both headstrong individuals that fight for what they believe in and will persevere until they accomplish their goals.<br /><br />  I thoroughly enjoyed this novel because it was very suspenseful and surprising throughout the whole plot. Suzanne Collins uses fantastic diction to describe each scene during the Games in order for the reader to actually feel bad for each tribute that dies. I really liked how dramatic and terrifying the obstacles each tribute needed to face in order to survive. I couldn't help but root for Katniss and Peeta's survival throughout their difficult journey as tributes once again. People between the ages of 13 and 25 would most enjoy this novel because of the teenage puppy love that is thrown into the mix of the plot. Both boys and girls will enjoy the suspenseful and exciting scenes Collins provides to her readers.e with him.

B00881VLCE|4.0|Very fun! I love the ability to show just the edge pieces! There are also plenty of free packs to download to keep the boredom at bay! My only small complaint is that I have some issues moving pieces to the main board sometimes. Overall I'm very happy that I downloaded this app!
B0053O8ARI|5.0|Oh My Gosh. I love this show. Cbs is doing its thing. No longer is this the network for old people.
B007WFR1MQ|4.0|I've been a fan of Fear Factory for a quite long time now.  I felt that \\"the Industrialist\\" was a good effort by the group.  The only thing I have against it is that, Mechanize was better.  It was just a better and more memorable album.  One other thing, this record was just a bit too soft, and too similar in that respect to Digimortal.  Of which I hated.  However, this record is what Digimortal should have been.  I think if your a Fear Factory fan, you need this one.  In my opinion the albums to own are: Soul of the New Machine (fans only) - Demanufacture, Obsolete, Mechanize, and The Industrialist.  Although this record has moments of greatness, it lacks the genius of  Mechanize.  As a side note, I believe that Mechanize will one day be regarded as the bands finest work.  Still, it makes me happy to hear Bell and Cazares working together again.  Fear Factory simply doesn't work otherwise.  The Industrialist is a good album, but not great.
B0086700CM|4.0|This game is very fun and addicting- I warned you. I'he waited for it to come out on kindlefire for a while now. Though the lagging is a bit disappointing, its a must-have for every gamer out there. It can be difficult to jump, duck, or turn, but otherwise its great!
B000FC2L1E|5.0|...refreshingly well written! The author's comprehensive historical research makes her stories vibrantly realistic, while seamlessly incorporating the fantasy element. Reading this for the second time, I'm as thoroughly absorbed as I was the first time.
B007HO392S|5.0|Love the CD!  As always, Carrie has some great songs on this CD!  I have all her CD's and this is a great addition to my library!
B005Y423ZC|5.0|Its Royal bleeping Albert Hall!  That's what Adele yells to the crowd before she starts an hour and a half of her best songs from both cd's.  A must for any Adele fan and you'll watch it over and over because of how amazing she is.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|just because its free it is the same as all the other angry birds and its so fun everyone should get this game
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Being the master storyteller that he is, 11/22/63 is a fascinating story that transcends time - literally. King was able to brilliantly tell what could have been just an ordinary time travel novel. There is a gripping twist about the story which differentiates it from the other time travel books that I have read. 11/22/63 has a lot of potential into becoming a classic.
B005HSL626|5.0|I t is so fun to play and has levals like arcade and others if you want to get comprative but dose sometimes averatives okay maybe a lot
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|How this movie was considered a box office flop is a mystery to me.  It has all of the elements required to make you feel it is believable in the world the story creates.<br />Watch it.  It is worth the money and your time.  Very entertaining.
0345803493|5.0|I love, love, love these books! They love story is perfect. These are the greatest books I've ever read. I think I will read them again!
B00846TRHY|5.0|The title seemed rash until I saw the movie.  It is a true title.  This movie is action with a deep truth rooting the action into some stunning realizations.  Watch it.  It is worth it.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|The world is a mess. I guess it always has been. And that is one reason this music is so important. It is blessed spiritual tonic of the highest order. There is no problem I have ever had or depression I have felt that this incredible music couldn't heal. It eminates from the heart of the divine and is a celebration of the purest and simplest joys of life and for that reason it's accessible to anyone willing to open to it. Brian is as much a messenger as he is a musician and the boys are his angelic choir. Argue intellectually all you want but this music goes way beyond that to the very spirit and joy of life itself. Remember your happiest moments of childhood. This music will take you there again. What an incredible gift to a world gone mad.
030771652X|3.0|This book had me HOOKED from the beginning. I read it on my Kindle on my phone whenever I had the chance. And then I got to the end. The story does not end it just stops. It builds and builds and builds and then dot dot dot<br />And the Prologue made me furious...<br />I wish the author would extend the end of the book in order to gain some closure on the story instead of leaving us all hanging. It was like watching a thrilling action-packed movie only it ends in the middle of the final exhilarating car chase...one car is chasing after the other and/the Credits start rolling in silence.  :(
B007J4T2G8|5.0|A joy for an adventurous romantic. James gives us two poeple with enough love to fill an ocean and enough pain to cover it with sky.
B003WWZ1R0|5.0|This is a GREAT CD!!!! My family loves it for meditation or just for a peaceful evening. I also listen to it in the car when I want to relax and clear my mind. Well worth the money!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is just the perfect thing for any kindle enthusiast. If you use your kindle fire or any andorid OS a lot, this becomes a wonderful tool, and helps you plan for your next shutdown, so you can get all the things you need done.

030758836X|5.0|I loved Sharp Objects, but as shocking as it is for me to believe, this book is as good if not better.  It's an incredible thriller, a bone chilling character piece, and I literally got shivers through my entire body reading it.  There is no doubt that this will be my favorite book of the year.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|very fun game<br />if u smart then get this<br />funnyy<br />crazy blab bosh Housman jfjsbh hueveh. hush jejune N'djamena N'djamena Keokuk Krupp jdjkalslskdjdjdh jrjdjjdbjahdjbrjj
B0054JZC6E|4.0|These games keep me entertained while riding the train everyday. They get a little redundant but still fun. The only thing I dislike is that getting a new game costs so many points so you end up playing the same few games over and over to pay for the new ones.
B007VGXS8M|1.0|These games was not very good at all it was boring and it was a disapointment. Don't buy this games u will end up wasting ur money on it. I am a big Wheres WALDO fan and the game could of bin better!!!!
1442337966|5.0|My husband and I enjoyed listening to this CD on a road trip together. We found the ideas inspirational and helpful. We had some great conversations around what we were listening to on the CD. We had an enjoyable trip full of inspiring thoughts and ideas we could apply and use along the way.
B007ZRZF8I|4.0|i been playing this on kindle fire for a little while and i think its pretty great i have no idea why all these people are talking about in game purchases I haven't been harrassed like other games about purchasing coins or tokens or anything fun and simple game would rate five except it feels a little boring after awhile all your doing is tapping the screen not sliding or tilting or anything
0345803493|5.0|All three of these books were very well written. It is very sexually explicit yet contains unexpected surprises in each of the books.You can actually see a complete change developing in the main characters'<br />attitudes and feelings,  I enjoyed all three books very much and would suggest that you read these with an open mind.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I would love to read this, but the publisher doesn't make it lendable through amazon. This is a DISGRACE! I purchase a book, and I can't lend it? Amazon did not tell anyone about this until after the kindle was purchased, if I knew this before I wouldn't have wasted my money. Thanks for nothing publisher and Amazon!
B007Z9RAX4|1.0|The story had somewhat of a plot; however, it's quickly killed by the slowness of the movie, the ackwardness of the dialogue, and for some reason (which I have never in my life seen this  other than cheap porn movies) the sound track was so out of place, so unmatched to the scenes that  it really completely killed the movie. Now, all not is bad, the fight scenes were good...the MMA background really shows, Her acting wasn't bad for a beginner (call it first movie gitters), and I guess the producers figured out that the movie could sell and keep most of the male attention by getting and incredibly sexy woman to kick a$$ and take names while at it... Well it worked, but not for long.  If you really had nothing to do one day, and are just vegging out on the couch and the remote happens to be right by your hand, aaaand the movie is either on tv or already loaded in whatever device you have.... then watch it, other than that dont go out of your way to see it.
0345803485|3.0|The book was in great shape but I  was disappointed with the way it was written. It did not excite me but I have only read a part of it. At THISp OINT it is a romantic novel for teenages with explicit sex
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I am really enjoying playing the Angry Bird Game it is a lot of fun and a Challenge. Everyone would love this game
B004XVMCMQ|5.0|This movie is really good, but don't expect it to follow Austen's book. It is however, loosely based on the book. In the movie, Fanny is much more assertive and daring. Also they substituted her relationship with her brother with one of her sisters. It is still very well done and I liked the story (it has a sub-theme about slavery in the West Indies which was interesting). All the actors were great.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I got this so my 6 yr old could start learning how to add and I think ive used it more! wash. big and quick!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Puts an amazing edge on my kitchen knives and on my daily beater Kershaw, and quick too. I've used that cheap crap \\"Samurai Shark\\" and others, and they're junk. I have tried traditional handled rod-type sharpeners like seen in butcher shops but could never get it perfect. To add to my accomplishments, I'm no expert with a whetstone either, so this is the next best thing. May not be as high quality as the big money Spyderco type, but it works awesome and is affordable. The pick, or Rat Tail, file is easy to use and small enough to sharpen serrated grooves, which is a big plus for me since I use them often. I constantly get compliments on my blade, but always refer them to this little gadget. Buy one, try one, then buy another. Even has a lanyard hole!
0312641893|3.0|From Reading and Writing Urban Fantasy and Paranormal Romance Blog<br /><br />At a Glance:<br />I was excited to finally read this book because I had heard so many great things about it. Plus, I am a sucker for fairy tales retold. I was blown away by Meyer's concept for a darker version of Cinderella. But in the end, I was left wanting more, and not in the good way.<br /><br />The Good<br />A Fairy Tale With Bite...<br />Cinder was even more than I expected. The sci-fi element of cyborgs and futuristic gadgets really added an intriguing spin to the fairy tale we all know and love. This is not a romance, it is not a tale of a meek, kind girl who gets everything she has ever dreamed of in the end. This story has grit (sometimes literally), injustice beyond comprehension, tragedy, and a society collapsing from all angles.<br /><br />We open this book to find that the world is cruel. Technology may have become more advanced, but society has not grown in its compassion. Cyborgs, both machine and human, are second class citizens, treated as good as trash, sometimes even experimented on for the good of the rest of the population. Cinder, a mechanic and a cyborg, has lived most her life knowing she means nothing to the world she lives in, and even less to the little family she has left. Then Prince Kai walks into her life and brings both hope and despair. He is a beacon of light that takes away some of the darkness Cinder must endure daily. But he also brings the knowledge that their slice of the world is in grave danger from not only the plague that is slowly eating away at the populace, but also the threat of an impending war against the Lunar people. What Cinder doesn't know is that she might just be the answer to the many problems her world is facing.<br /><br />Rise Above the Ashes...<br />I think each individual character in this book played a vital part in bringing this story together. Cinder was a lot stronger than I was expecting. She has been resigned to a life of labor in order to support people who despise her. She is experimented on and treated like nothing better than an unfeeling machine. She is blamed for things she has no control over, and still she perseveres. She works hard, takes initiative to make her life better, and learns to fight back. She is resilient and resourceful when she could have easily crumbled under the horrible life she is forced to live. Parts of her may be made of wire and metal, but she's also just a teenage girl who can love and wants to be loved.<br /><br />The Other Peeps...<br />I was surprised that Meyer let us also peek into Prince Kai's POV. We get to watch him struggle as his life starts to crumble around him and no matter what decisions he makes, people will die, people will suffer. That's a lot of pressure for someone so young. I think he does a good job for the position he is in. Then we have the stepmother and stepsister who are just as bad as you can imagine. The Lunar Queen was a great addition to the story. Her presence actually gave me the chills. You will hate these three women. But the character that made me smile and laugh was Iko. She really stole some of the spotlight because of her adorable personality. I want to see more of her in the series.<br /><br />Oomph...<br />The twists in this tale gave the story a lot of oomph. Meyer went beyond the simple premise of Cinderella and jumped leaps and bounds to bring us a world of darkness and light, injustice and triumphs, selfishness and selflessness. Pending war and political intrigue were also a big part of Cinder, which I liked.  Meyer's ability to take the story of Cinderella and turn it into a light sci-fi with cyborgs and Lunar people was ingenious. She has a great concept to work off of for the rest of the series.<br /><br />The Bad<br />I really wanted to like this book more. I almost gave it 3.5 stars because in many ways I did like this book. But there were too many things that annoyed me to justify that rating. First off, the book never really kept my attention. I could easily put it down, and I did, often. At one point I read a whole other book before I came back to Cinder. Most of the time I just wanted to skip to the end--so at least I knew how it ended--and be done with it.<br /><br />Cinder is a not a very engaging book. It has such an interesting premise and idea and all that potential was untapped. I wanted more world building. I wanted more explanation about society, the past and present, and I wanted to know more about cyborgs. Cinder is both human and machine, but how? I know fantasy doesn't always have to have perfect reasoning, but you should be able to support your fantastical elements with some logic or explanation on how it works.<br /><br />It was also predictable. No, not because we all know the story about Cinderella. The predictability had nothing to do with the fairy tale. I knew from the beginning who Cinder was and how she was important. Meyer made it too obvious. It ruined the suspense for me.<br /><br />The ending was not a happy one. I felt like I went through this somewhat depressing book to finish with an ending that wasn't really an ending. Nothing good came out of this story. It was just one mess after another and then we got cut off.<br /><br />The Snuggly<br />I was hoping for a little more romance. I think Meyer is saving that for the rest of the series. We get to witness the building of a possible romance and that's it. For me, Kai and Cinder's \\"relationship\\" felt a little forced. I didn't see what they both saw in each other. I like them as individuals but not necessarily together.<br /><br />Overall<br />Yes, I rated this book very harshly. I simply can't give a book with so many problems that many stars. But the three stars are for the characters I found interesting and for the idea that may not have been developed well but was an amazing concept to begin with. I will be continuing this series. I want to see what happens next. I just hope Meyer finds a way to work out the kinks in her writing. Recommended for most of my readers. I think my writing background had a lot do to with my rating, and I feel many readers will not find the faults I did.<br /><br />Excerpt<br />\\"Come to the ball with me.\\"<br /><br />She froze. Everyone in the hallway froze.<br /><br />Cinder turned back. Kai was still standing in elevator B, one hand propping open the door.<br /><br />Her nerves were frazzled, and all the emotions of the past hour were converging into a single, sickening feeling--desperation. The hall was filled with doctors, nurses, androids, officials, technicians, and they all fell into an awkward hush and stared at the prince and the girl in the baggy cargo pants he was flirting with.<br /><br />Flirting., the book never really kept my attention.

B0001HAISG|4.0|Not having read the book, I don't know how close to the actual story this was but I saw some scenes in here I hadn't remembered from other movies.  Of course the cartoons always change the story and the musicals have to make a place for the songs to fit and have to cut something out.  I enjoyed the two main characters and their interaction, and enjoyed the actor playing the father and the Captain.  This could be a little intense for the young children, but the rest of the family will enjoy it.  All in all, I liked it.
B007N85ZXY|5.0|i have no idea what the negative reviews could possibly be hearing THIS IS CLASSIC SOUNDING NEIL YOUNG AND CRAZY HORSE... I've played this album around 15 times over the last week or two...at first i was a bit dubious about the whole idea ..especially including another choir..but seriously this really works amazingly well..first off..it has that classic old crazy horse sound.and what a beautiful sound that is..loud crunching guitars and a loose ,sloppy but right on the money rhythm section...and the child like choir works brilliantly, it almost hauntingly eerie in the way those voices are used , especially clementine and wayfaring stranger..seriously fantastic versions ,reinvented here to stunning effect...iamgine side two of rust never sleeps...<br />actually gallows pole,wayfaring stranger,this land is your land,gotta travel on,high flying bird are without doubt the best versions I've heard..overall the lp has a dark brooding vibe to a lot of it..plenty of murder and death songs.....play it loud..i love it
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What a wondeful book!  I am glad I purchased this as a collection.  All the books have nice stopping points.  But why not read them all?  Couldn't put it down.  Best sci-fi I've read in a long time!
B007CGLRWA|5.0|Ok, i always preface with the fact that i rarely feel moved to offer my opinion, but every now and then i randomly come across a movie that blows my socks off.<br />So for a somewhat thoughtful viewer knowing nothing about this film, watch it. if you're a teacher, or work with the public, watch this film. if you like to walk at night and think, if you want to FEEL something in return for your movie watching time, watch this film.<br />This film leaves little left to say, so i won't try to add anything unneeded. for those who need a comparison, \\"a single man\\" but without the glamorous casting and wardrobe......well even that's off. the kind of movie that doesn't nessecarily offer you hope on a platter, but it definately shows that it's behind one of many doors, and leaves the choice to you.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use this app and the daily readings all the time. This app is a nice option for Bible. my church uses it too for live events.
0765316994|5.0|God damn you, John Scalzi. God damn you.<br /><br />Yes, Redshirts was that good. I read it in about 3 hours, because I couldn't put it down. I couldn't stop reading it, because I had to find out what happened. You made me giggle hysterically through most of it. The obsession with pants is a nice touch.<br /><br />You even made me cry at one point. Two points, actually. Bastard.<br /><br />And now I want the sequel. Even though I know you said you weren't planning one yet, I really, really want one.<br /><br />Please.
B003Y5H5F6|5.0|I view this film and to me since I lover Vampire Movies it was very good indeed. The actress is superb in every one of her vampire movies. Her costumes and her way of being just her. She becomes one of them which to me it is like a love story which happens in the rest of the films. You must watch all four to get the point of what it is all about. The action is great and she does gets her point. I would make it a point for viewers to see all four. It has suspense and very intriguing the costumes are all vintage in their time.
0345803485|1.0|I was given this farce as a gift. Laughable, Juvenile and Inane. If I were going to be willingly bored, I would read St. Augustine's Confessions.  Not worth a rating. Now bat your eyes, breathe hard, flush and say \\"Holy C...\\" My inner Goddess is gagging...
B004H1V5RU|5.0|The packaging was great. Even though it says 13 and over my 7 & 10yr old have both beat the puzzle. After hours of non stop play. They still play with it everyday, love puzzle alot. Toy is very good condition too.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love it it's a great game I can't stop playing it I'm telling all my friends to play the game
B0086700CM|1.0|its gives you barley any coins from running. plus it isnanlot of money to buy coins. the upgrades are also to many coins to get.
B0086700CM|5.0|I was very happy to see it finally came out on Kindle Fire. I would rate it 5 stars, but sometimes I will jump or slide, and it lags, causing me to fall off or lose my head and start over. But I highly recommend this game, the small amount of lag is easy to deal with. Though it would be nice if it didn't. So I hope they fix it. But come on people, this game is very fun/addicting. Most games lag at some point, so don't downrate Temple Run because of it. You should get this game!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its just likehdhdgdgsvsgsgsyg  thats what i think what do u all think. freakin bead idk what im sayinso u lol..,
B00881VLCE|4.0|This is a rather fun app. I like that you can buy puzzle packs with 6 or more puzzles for just a buck.  the ability to choose a puzzle and have it as one. of four puzzle piece options (different difficulties) is nice too. gave it four stars because sometimes it won't react to me trying to drag a piece for several tries even with a clean screen and stylus
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a really great game. What I like about it is that when you collect coins in the game, you can use the coins to buy different features in the game, so in other words, you don't have to use your own money to get a better experience. Also, I got Temple Run for free, and I have not seen a single add, which is really cool. I highly recommend this game to anyone.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|this app is ok but u crewmen download 2 things ur kf starts to force cloth and then when it says 100 % it force closes and you get back on there it turns red u resume download and it says 10% wtf wtf is this app doing well its for all youtube downloaders except youtune downloader the one that looks like those acting things
B005K17RU0|5.0|its great I love it. I use it every day. its super cool. I could super awesome I let me friends use it
0345803485|1.0|I REALLY wanted Anastasia's inane \\"Inner Goddess\\" and her prude \\"Subconscious\\" to strangle one another with that damn tie. This book had NO redeeming qualities. The author used the phrases \\"my breath hitched\\", \\"his long fingers\\" and \\"his long legs\\" almost once every two pages. I want to send her a thesaurus. I can't imagine trying to listen to this babble being read aloud.<br /><br />In addition, what American student graduating from college in the year 2011 is shocked by \\"having their own email address!\\" and using a laptop computer \\"the mean machine\\" or a Blackberry? Clearly James is out of touch with the generation she tries to write about.<br /><br />Regretfully, I can't give this book less than one star.
B006OCM0G0|1.0|I hated this game so much the customers wouldnt wait one minute for their food. This game is wierd anyway.
B0086700CM|5.0|you should totally get this game it has only one flaw lag<br />still one of the best games of 2011
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|There are so many things that you have to do but you end up feeling that your actually are in that time period.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love this App..... Makes it very easy to read the Most Important Book you can ever read :)They have many different Plans and you can get a daily reminder also. You can read and or listen to the Bible. Highly recommend this
B005C5A6C0|2.0|I've been with these guys since Burn My Eyes and even saw them with Slayer in the mid-90's (Divine Intervention tour) and with the exception of Supercharger have eagerly anticipated and enjoyed every Machine Head release, especially Through the Ashes of Empires and the phenomenal The Blackening. But from first listen last fall to today I simply cannot stand this Machine Head release, Unto the Locust. It's a pretentious mess of guitar-god noodling that goes nowhere fast, melo-dramatic, sappy lyrics and, my god, a children's choir on one of the songs. It sounds they were shooting for The Blackening part two, but could not get lightening to strike the same place twice. On a positive note, I'm really, really glad I did NOT shell out big bucks on the deluxe CD version, instead opting for the much cheaper download and even then, for the first time ever, I want a refund. I do want to say something positive about Machine Head because they are a great band and that is all of these songs will probably sound much better live like the Supercharger stuff on Hellalive. I hope so.<br />I downloaded this Machine Head turd and Opeth-Heritage (deluxe) on the same day- guess which one I listen to much more often?<br />I really hope this is not the new Machine Head sound because I'll probably just sit the next one out.
B005LAIHY0|1.0|Ok, not going to rant, but i watch movies like a eat food (very often) I understand its a prespective thing, but this movie lacks in every area. Complete mishap in the Ailiens franchise.... Nothing more to say.. Still pissed i lost my time and ticket money for this junk...
B00785P2QC|5.0|love it if i could i would quit my job and play it all day it is a very very additive game cant wait to get back to it now
B0079J28NW|5.0|Purchased this blu-ray as a gift for my 10-year-old son who's recently become a Beatles fan, and last night we watched it. Who would have thought that Yellow Submarine turned out to be one of the best blu-ray releases ever? It is. Color and detail leap from the screen, and the immersive 5.1 DTS soundtrack is nothing less than stupendous. I have never heard sound sound so good on a blu-ray disc before. I haven't seen the film since sometime in the late 70's, and boy how I had forgotten how funny and entertaining it is.<br /><br />If you are a Beatles fan, a music fan, a sound fan, an animation fan or simply a film fan, Yellow Submarine should be on your short list of must-have blu-ray titles.
0553386794|3.0|Its not a bad book, its just completely over-rated. The good news, it has some really fleshed out interesting characters, but the plot is really schizophrenic in a way. The plot is very convoluted and it takes forever to get anywhere. Is George R.R. Martin the American Tolkien? He's more like the American Stephen King who seems determined to fill his epic novels with page after page of filler (One wonders if he is getting paid by the page, perhaps?) Too many characters, too many sub-plots, it quickly becomes too tedious too read. It has its good moments but by end of the Clash of Kings I was wondered the payoff was worth devoting all this time and effort to continue reading. Despite that, I intend to finish the series, but not right away. I might come back to it if I can find the time.
B000059T1E|4.0|I got this album for really just three songs but it has turned out to be quite enjoyable.  Steve Winwood is great.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't put the book down, first time every reading an Erotica book, but definetly won't be my last. No wonder the hype over Fifty Shades.  Loved it!!
B0086700CM|5.0|dis game rox I play it 24/7 all de peeps dat say dat dis game sucks they seriously need help ok. I said enough buy dis. game&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;!!!!!!&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!
B001P50HOI|5.0|I love the DVD, but the CD sounds much better, or should I say that the production on the CD brings the orchestra a bit forward. Yes sometimes sound like an orchestra with just five members. But the complex arrangements of Yes's music lend themselves to this kind of event I highly reccomend this to any true Yes fan
1456407872|5.0|Who doesn't love Dickens?
0307455378|3.0|Esta segunda entrega de Ruiz Zafon, dista mucho de su predecesor La Sombra del Viento. Es una historia extremadamente larga y complicada que a mi entender, y por lo que parece, sucumbe antes las presiones de la editorial, de entregar a tiempo el producto final. Tiene un final apresurado y que carece de sentido, con personajes que se quedan en el aire y otros con un final sacado como dice otro lector, de una pelicula de James Bond. Gracias que hay una tercera entrega (y definitivamente habra una cuarta) de esta serie, que al menos trata de explicar un poco la madeja de personajes e historias que Ruiz Zafon nos presenta en El Juego del Angel.
B00005K483|5.0|The lens hood fits great, however putting in on the lens backward for travel protection doesn't really stay on. Non the less, I am satisfied with this product. I purchased it for my canon 70-300 lens.
B0068TL23G|3.0|This is a fairly good game that is hurt by a user interface that is not forgiving in where you touch the screen making it frustrating at best to use. For example, to use the controls such as the undo button or the hint star you have to tap the screen in exactly the right place to trigger the control even if where you touch the screen includes the control you want to use. It often take several taps to get the undo to work and getting the other controls to work is even worse. I ended up deleting the game in frustration with no intention to ever play it again.
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|My husband and I just finished watching \\"John Carter\\" and we both thoroughly enjoyed it.  It made for a perfect Friday night date movie - all the action for him, all the romance and creativity for me!  At one point, he asked me to pause the movie for a sec and - lifelong SciFi fan that he is - he asked me if he'd remembered correctly that the professional movie critics had really panned it?  Yes.  But just another great SciFi creation they just don't get - or else they're just unhappy with the studio's swag (or have a grudge)!  But whatever, don't let the corporate media bummers dissuade you from watching this movie.  It's 5 STARS.  Easily!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting for this forever! You wont be dissapointed at all. It's really a fum game for anyone and it was about time it came out on the kindle.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I found the booking disappointment, maybe because there is so much hype about it and my expectations were too high.<br />Fist of all 21 years old virgin? hard to believe<br /> and from her first time having sex she is having mind blowing orgasims<br />I found the book filled in with fluff, like pages and pages of e mails between them that don't say anything but fill the pages. Each of them on his cover letter with at least six lines filled with name, subject, date etc and one or two words or one line of the actual e mail and very childish<br />Maybe it is meant for younger audience but I am 44 and found it lacking and have hard time finishing it. Keep reading hoping it will get better but it does not.<br />To me it was waste of money!
B0059WTMLW|5.0|This game is so good, better than Amazon Sn-MahD or Playstation IV games! Love the music, the great 3D graphics, the sound, and the controls. This app actually improved my battery life by 75%
B007J4T2G8|3.0|if you're an avid reader, this is not the book/trilogy for you.  the repetitive use of words throughout the series is enough to annoy anyone (i seriously do not know how any publishing house read her draft and thought 'yes, perfectly written, we will publish this for you'.<br />if you're looking for an entertaining book that is an easy read, go for it.<br />honest opinion, including the author's attempt at erotica, i don't understand why this particular series became a sensation.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|Adele has a story which she tells in each of her songs.  She is able to connect with a wide mix of people and I think that is why she is such a hit.  A great disc and you will listen to it often without tiring from hearing it.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Don't get this version it is worth the 99 cents for the other one. This one will annoy the heck out of you. GET THE OTHER. ONE!!!!!!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|this is a must have app for those of us who love being organized. I love having the ability to customize all of my content just the way I want. The possibilities. are endless.
B003F3NEBG|5.0|I have long thought that this A&E/BBC miniseries adaptation of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is by far the best.  It follows the original text as closely as can be expected, allowing for a few necessary changes to make the story work as a screenplay.  In fact, it is so similar to the book that you could almost follow along, which is certainly rare.  Jennifer Ehle gives an excellent portrayal of Elizabeth Bennett, and Colin Firth's performance as Mr. Darcy is exceptional.  True fans of Jane Austen's writing will not be disappointed!<br /><br />I have previously seen this miniseries on VHS and DVD; I can say that this Blu-Ray version is definitely of superior quality.  The picture is significantly sharper, so much so that I sold my DVD version and now only watch this one.  I highly recommend it!
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Many others have given the plot synopsis so I'll stick with my pros and cons.  No cons.  ALL PRO for this book!  I did not read reviews prior to beginning this book, so I didn't know that the alternating chapters were by the same person, pre- and post-event.  I liked it that way because it built very gradually as the story unfolded.<br /><br />I was completely engrossed and caught up in the characters' progress.  This book, my friends, is truly a primer on how to build tension to a crescendo.  As the seemingly separate chapters began to merge, my anxiety rose in concert with Cathy's.  I was truly terrified at times and was so afraid that this would end badly for all.<br /><br />I rarely rave about a book and giving it 5 stars means I wouldn't ask for anything to be changed.  It was perfect.  It was dark and disturbing at times, but so is life.  It was raw and real and painful, giving great insight into PTSD and OCD caused by domestic violence at it's worst.<br /><br />This isn't for the faint of heart, but it is for those who really appreciate the finer things in life:  fine dining, fine writing, fine entertainment.  A+, 5 stars, 100%.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|Prometheus is brilliant. The visual effects and concepts are stunning, breath-taking and ingenious. The storyline is intriguing, thrilling and leaves you at the edge of your seat. The characters are engaging and fascinating.<br /><br />Some people are too caught up in criticizing the film to a ridiculous extent and end up giving it a 1 out of 10, which is absolutely insane.  Actually, anything below \\"7\\" is grossly unjustified. Meanwhile these same people end up giving lousy films like Chernobyl Diaries and Battleship much, much better scores?? These people are just utterly retarded and have absolutely no scarcely detectable amount of ability or talent to discern and recognize a work of brilliance when they see it. They are really abusing their privilege of leaving reviews, which are anything but fair and reasonable.<br /><br />This is definitely my top favorite of the entire Alien \\"franchise\\". The story is big, and I appreciate that the film does not try to jam all the answers in one go, but instead opens the door to further possibilities, and the continuation of the theme.<br /><br />Those who are not familiar with the Alien films, may not apprise and empathize the full scope of all the nuances in the film. However, if you can appreciate an extremely high quality film with a captivating and suspenseful storyline, you will surely enjoy Prometheus. This is truly the best film I've seen since Avatar, and it ranks right up there with it.
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|This is a great fun simple game especially on tablets with the big screen. you can play up to four people at a time
B007SGM084|5.0|The trilogy was awesome to read. I couldn't put the books down . The characters were so interesting and at times I could relate to them.

B0086700CM|3.0|I love the game itself, but on my kindle it lags...ALOT. and that really makes me mad because the game is so much fun! please fix it soon!!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This book is worth much more than the price asking. I immediately became hooked! The ups, the downs, the fights, and the love shared between Abby and Travis brought on real emotions. I say five stars all the way!!! Loved it!!!
B00008F2LT|5.0|When i got it, i was expecting it to be in a pretty bad condition, but i was really surprised when i got it and it was like new, no scratches, no skips, and had arrived earlier than expected.
B0086700CM|5.0|nice game. the graphics are cool plus its fun game. I would recommend it to anyone.  thanks for finally coming up with one that works.
B00881VLCE|3.0|the game is good u can download different puzzles for free and you get to chose how many pieces you want the puzzle to be.
B007L96SI6|1.0|I was Haley's big fan on \\"American Idol\\".<br />This is very disappointing CD of such talented singer.<br />Quality of recording is very bad (like homemade).<br />Song selection, lyrics, back-up singing and sound of instruments-unbalanced.<br />Her distinctive bluesy approach to the music is lost and replaced with some second-rate blend of pop.<br />This CD is locking style and sense of direction. Haley's unique voice sounds annoying.<br />Change of producer and management is a must.<br />I feel sorry for her and wish Haley well in the future.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|best little games ever!!!<br />once you start playing it's hard to put it down the rummest part is unlocking the other games
B005LAIH5O|2.0|After the remake of the first movie, I was expecting a little more from this sequel.<br /><br />I mean, really, with the power of 3-D creation available today, why make a creature such as the \\"hydra\\" so ugly in this movie?<br /><br />Killing off the girl before the sequel even starts?  What the hell?!?<br /><br />I paid to see this in a theater, and viewing it once was more then enough.<br />This one is a RENTAL at best...
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I love this case!  It fit my kindle fire like a glove!  I love that it opens like a book and can also be folded to be used as a stand.  The inside of the cover is felt lined so it protects the screen nicely.  This case gives me not only piece of mind knowing that my Kindle is protected, but also makes it better and easier to use!
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Don't blame the app and rate it badly because you have no friends or anything. Make some friends instead of rating a app poorly because it's too boring for you cause you don't have interactions. It's as simple as : My twitter name is PandahNightmare. Follow me!
B005K17RU0|4.0|I have to say I like the app on the kindle fire but ive got a little gripe with the radar sometimes being blank as far as the incoming weather fronts.  My cell phone with an app from the same service shows it up clearly at these times maybe its the data stream but the warning symbols still show up and I cant complain much more than that seeing its free.
0385523394|5.0|Piper Kernan does a great job at giving you an inside look to her prison world. While I wonder how her experience differentiates from the rest of the system (based on where you stay) it is an intriguing look into her personal experience. Her detailed accounts and honest emotions pull you into the story as if you were there, sleeping in the bunk beside her...
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is very addictive.  great way to kill time.  love it.  the monkey creature things are creaky looking.  sometimes lags but not enough to rate less.
B0086700CM|5.0|I absolutely love this game its awesome....I am glad kindle fire has this game in their apps store..I play it piratically everyday
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Great quick read book. Lots of tips and good points. Helpful in gaining knowledge on how to get leaner and bigger. Overload and stimulate and eat right along with few supplements and you're on your way to your goal. Good job mike
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I enjoyed the book.It tells a good story and has a action plot. It has a few flaws but is worth reading.
B004ZISVWC|1.0|I watched this movie based on the four and a half stars...  The reviewers must have all been Norwegian family members of the film maker.  This plot is so tired and the effects were so bad give me a break.  No one on a film shot can figure out how to use night vision at night??  It's just stupid...the movie is stupid...and I feel stupid for wasting my time watching it...
0345803485|5.0|I thought this was a very interesting book. I could not put it down, but it is very erotic so if you are not one that enjoys this type of stories you may not like this. Another thing I liked about this book was it has a good story that kept my interest in it, most erotic books do not. I bought all 3 in this series.
B005JE7WKI|4.0|The title and cover are bad, but the movie is great! Watch at least the first 20 minutes, then you'll be hooked. In the same family as 'Shaun of the Dead'.
B0086700CM|5.0|Awesome game. Just like the i-one.I have really enjoyed it. A 1 game. We have been waiting a long time for this one.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|It's always nice when an app delivers what it promises and this one certainly does and does it well Nothing fancy or complicated...it simply lets you know how much you have left on your battery and how much time you have on your devices.  Sometimes simple zis still be..st.

B005ORVMCY|3.0|As a longtime Rush fan, audio production engineer and high resolution/surround music fan, I'm compelled to review the second time remastering of the Rush Mercury catalog.  The albums in this \\"Sector 2\\" box represent one of my favorite Rush eras.  The first remaster (and original mastering) was done by Bob Ludwig, and these \\"Sector\\" remasters were performed by Andy Vandette, who also mastered Rush \\"Retrospective III\\".<br /><br />First, the DVD-Audio disc \\"A Farewell To Kings\\".  It does not provide nearly the three dimensional effect as surround mixes by Elliot Scheiner or Steven Wilson.  I would say it's more like an ambient stereo mix as opposed to a true 5.1 surround mix.  However, there is added detail to this mix that isn't in the original stereo mix so it's still an upgrade of sorts.<br /><br />The CDs sound better on about half of the songs on all of the albums and virtually identical to the Bob Ludwig '97 remasters on the remainder. For example, the song \\"Circumstances\\" sounds clearer and fuller on the new remaster but \\"The Trees\\" sounds virtually identical to the '97 remaster, so not every single song sounds different, but at least half do. Don't get me wrong, they are still worth owning as the '97 remasters sounded pretty good too and were MUCH improved over the original release CDs which were soft and muddy. This is the case because Andy VanDette amassed together the best sounding audio for individual songs from both his own tape transfers of the original masters and high resolution digital files from transfers of the master tapes done 7 or 8 years ago, when those tapes were younger and less degraded. The songs he was able to improve upon do sound a little fuller and clearer. My only nitpick is VanDette's heavy handedness with the bass frequencies, which were boosted just a little too much resulting in the timbral balance to be thrown off slightly.  He did not take the same approach when remastering \\"Retrospective III\\" and I personally prefer his work on that compilation.  The \\"Retrospective III\\" release is one of the best sounding Rush CDs available IMHO.  I would give this 5 stars had he made these box sets sound similarly improved.<br /><br />Is this release a good value?  It is IMHO.  I've paid upwards of $50 for single disc DVD-A releases, and here you also get 5 remastered albums in mini LP sleeves for the same price.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is the best game play it all the time I have been waiting forever for it to come on the fire
B0059WTMLW|1.0|why does it need to modify my storage content? Why does the needs full internet access? Cut back on the permissions and I can change the review. Won't install, even for free.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This app is great!!  Don't listen to the bad reviews. Trust me out of all 25 apps I have this one is the best.
B0086700CM|5.0|it was the most entertaining game I have ever played it takes your mind off things and you start playing it you look at the clock and you would be amazed how much time passed
B0086700CM|5.0|Love this game very addictive! Couldn't stop playing! Graphics are good and mustard overall fun game to play and it was free!
0345529057|5.0|This item was less expensive than from other sellers, and arrived speedily! The books are, naturally, quite good, but follow the show a bit closely. I definitely recommend!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|very cute and great for kids. once you start playing you wont be able to stop! One of my favorite games.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|LOVE IT! It does everything I would want and more. Plus it makes for some hilarious facebook photos to share between friends!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I LOVED IT . WHEN ARE THE DVD'S COMMING OUT NOT ONLY FOR THIS BOOK WHICH I COULD NOT PUT DOWN BUT FOR THE ENTIRE SERIES.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I like reading books on my tablet with this Kindle app, but I really wish there was a way to create folders so I can organize my books. There's also no way to mark books read, which I believe is a necessity.  Also, since the last update, the current book I'm reading no longer goes to the top of my library, so a few times I've started a book at random , and then lost it when I closed the app, because I didn't remember the title! That's a bit annoying.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|Nice game, slow at first but picks up as you move along. looks like an action game but it is actually much more about strategy.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|The software is very easy to use and runs smoothly. The puzzle is easy in the beginning but challenges you more and more with each level. Great strategy game. The only thing I would like is to have the music available in puzzle mode as well (the music from the main menu is very relaxing). :-)
B007JM4CWY|5.0|crossme is a fun, challenging game of logic. also has a polished interface and performs well on my nexus. well worth the money, looking forward to future updates.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The first half of this book is so masterful that it makes the second half feel like a tragic betrayal. I don't normally read crime novels, but the great reviews and wide media coverage of Gone Girl made me want to check it out. I was initially mesmerized. The subtle psychological elements, the genius way in which two very different--eerily, ominously different--portraits of the same marriage unfold, all make you feel as though you are in the hands of a formidable storyteller. You're aware that there must be a \\"twist\\" coming which would explain the conflicting stories of husband and wife, but when it does come, it is so profoundly silly and unbelievable that it unravels the finely wrought work of the first half of the novel. And it only gets sillier from there. The last quarter of the book reads not like a suspenseful thriller but like the script of some awful 80's made-for-TV movie.<br /><br />Such an incredible start, such a shambles of a finish.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is the only game I have ever recommend. It is the only game I have found which drew me back for more every day.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|The Beach Boys hold a very special place in my heart.  My first concert was a Beach Boys concert.  To have Brian Wilson at the helm on \\"That's Why God Made the Radio\\", and the inclusion of all living original members, is a delightful treat.  This album, while not containing a standout mega-hit single, must be judged as a whole.  From the album's opening track, \\"Think About the Days\\", the listener is taken on a spiritual journey via the unmistakable harmonies of this legendary band.  The title track is a nod and wink towards the bygone days of rock 'n' roll radio, while \\"The Private Life of Bill and Sue\\" examines our obsession with the superstars of the entertainment industry.  Throughout this album, guitarist Al Jardine continuously demonstrates why he has been and always will be an integral part of the Beach Boys legendary sound. Jardine's vocals carry the weight on several tracks, including the haunting, \\"From There To Back Again\\".  Yet, the leadership of Beach Boys founder Brian Wilson, who produced and wrote the majority of the tracks on this, the band's 29th studio effort, is essential to the fluidity of \\"That's Why God Made the Radio\\".  Should this be the band's final studio release, which many, including band members themselves have publicly stated, then \\"That's Why God Made the Radio\\" is a musical experience that the Beach Boys should be proud of and their fans sincerely enjoy for generations to come.
B004W1GCQO|5.0|I enjoyed this very much.  I am looking forward to the 2nd season.<br />PBS never disappoint. The stars in this series are fantastic. A joy to watch.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|it's what you want in a calculator. no accidently deleting everything and you can delete he last digit if you messed up. nice big numbers and good looking design.
B005OCHOZS|3.0|I really enjoyed reading this book until the end when I thought it fell flat.  His stories were both inspirational and educational and i appreciated his vegan spin.  However, the way the book ended left me feeling unsatisfied.. I guess the real ending to the story is still a work in progress.  Like previous reviewers I also wished he gave more stories of his personal life in the second half of the book. Overall a good story and well written.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This ebook was definitley worth reading.  I loved the book!  I would highly recommend getting and reading this ebook.  Happy reading!
B004GYY714|5.0|I love listening to music when I'm doing house chores. It is very clear and I can listen to any station for different kinds of music. Love it!
B007NYODBS|5.0|The Acting is great and the dialogue is is fantastic I laughed so much it hurt... If your a married person you will enjoy this film...
B004SUWR2C|5.0|I love uno. I like the way it looks on my kindle fire. This is a good pass time when you are bored. The virtual guests that I play against is fun. I win everytime.
B002L4QP0M|1.0|A very disappointing story.  A stereotypical super villain.  A hero  who is well behind the reader in figuring out the plot twists. But the biggest problem is that plot is essentially one long chase. Save your money.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game provides hours of fun for solitaire gammers. Its fair and provides different game levels to help new bees get better.
1401207529|4.0|Book arrived in a short amount of time in wonderful condition.  It's not the best Batman story I've read, but it is a must read for fans.
B005IQZB14|3.0|Cheryl Strayed's memior of her PCT adventure is excellent, and informative. Brutally honest insights. Yet if you had lost a loved one recently this is not the book for you at this time. I felt she went on overboard wrt her mother dying. I had to skip a lot of what seemed to be redundancy in expressing loss and all that goes with it; healing and moving on in such detail is hard to digest when you are going through it yourself. I focused on her trail adventures instead.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Love feedly in general.  But recently learner there is an andriod version.  Gave it a try and fell in love.<br /><br />Like it better than flipboard which now has a beta out for andriod.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I am so completely in love with the story of Christian and Ana. I may read it again. Definately worth the read, I could not put these books down.
0345525558|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It hops back and forth between the girl's life at age 10 and age 18.  I was able to predict some of the key plot points, but that didn't hamper my enjoyment.  The ending was a little fast for me and not quite as satisfying as I had hoped.
B0088TG252|4.0|Pretty cool story if you didn't watch Bourne series. It's got a little Training day mixed in also.<br />Great acting. DZ's perfect for the role cause it's a good combo of psychological and action thriller. CIA takes a pretty good beating once again. Unfortunate but entertaining.
B00881VLCE|4.0|good way to kill time. wish the puzzle pieces were a little more responsive. fun with lots of free downloadable puzzles to expand.
B007ZRZF8I|4.0|Fast paced blood pumping action that keeps you clawing for more!!!  Simple to play with good graphics.  A little slow to start but everything after that is quick.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Really good. I love it. although less time for energy. other than that its great. my siblings also like it a lot.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I am thououghly enjoying this game on my Kindle Fire. The random tableaux are fresh every time. When my DrawSomething playmates aren't quick enough to keep me occupied, this is my solitaire option.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This book gave me the quick information that I needed to get my book published and up on line. Great help!
B007ZKY7XO|1.0|What a piece of garbage!!!!!!!  If you are buying this album and expecting the genious of \\"Tah Da\\" or the lightheartedness of the first album, or the good feelings of \\"Night Work\\".....DON'T BUY IT.  It is pure CRAP!  I have never been so disappointed in something I had been looking forward to.  Just like their concerts...you pay good money, you wait 5 hours PAST the time they are supposed to appear, and then you can't understand a word of what they say cuz it's so loud and obnoxious.  I am a MAJOR Sissor Sisters fan but this album is one of the BIGGEST waste of money I've ever spent on and album.  I'd rather listen to Meat Loaf's new album which is BAD compaired to this piece of CRAP!
B004EPZ0BG|2.0|This is a very predictable love story about two obnoxious people that claim they just want to be friends. We all know where this is going. The only reason to see this is to get a glimpse of Mila Kunis naked. But all you get is some side boob and a butt double. I want my money back. Ripoff!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I have a dog name PeeWee. Maybe if you get a dog name it PeeWee. Calling him PeeWee shows his characteristics. First Lee in PeeWee shows he like to lee a lot. Like my mom's coach and when we take him to Pet Smart he lees on all the isles. Wee in PeeWee is standing for his wee wee. He likes to to clean it a lot. Have fun with my dog PeeWee.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been whating for this game for a while and now its finaly hear. Honestly it took this long time just to get hear on the amozon app store I hope everyone finaly found peace.

B0086700CM|5.0|This app is the bees knees! four generations of my family are obsessed with playing this game. We all play on the kindle fire and we love it!
B005FISBV2|2.0|I'll start off by saying that I was at least entertained by a good portion of the season.  It's not that this is boring or doesn't hold your interest; what the problem is that the characters are changing into people that are just not likeable like they were.<br /><br />Some of the mistakes Dexter makes this season are ridiculous.  I know he gets into jams and that is what keeps the show interesting, but I am just not caring about his character as he time after time goes into situations completely wrecklessly.  \\"I am a very neat monster.\\"  What happened to that?  Dexter stopped being a \\"neat monster\\" in season 4 when he hung out with Arthur Mitchell in broad daylight and called his cell phone and whatnot, but this season it becomes noticably absurd how much Dexter wants to get caught.<br /><br />And he's not the only character that is being ruined.  Deb hits one out of left field toward the end - I mean seriously, it is completely absurd.  Plot twists that have no business ruining a good show just spring up out of nowhere.  The cliffhanger at the end of the season was completely wasted.  It should have happened last season or at least under different circumstances.  This is a mild spoiler, but Dexter uses AN ACTIVE CRIME SCENE as a kill room.  WHAT!?  Send that man to jail, he deserves it for being a horse's arse!<br /><br />The writing took a nose dive.  It really disappoints me, too, because I have every season of Dexter on blu ray, but I can't get this one because it will just make me angry.  Or sad.  Or horny, for some odd reason.  No, not horny.  Just the first two.  I would say go ahead and watch it, but don't buy it.
B0085Z8F4A|2.0|Wow I am truley disapointed I'm not going to compare this to the first alien because it truley isn't even in the same universe literally and movie quality wise. But its hard not to because the same director directed the same movies! Impossible to tell though when your watching it.. where to start with this mess first the writing is truly poor really horrible. the characters are truly expendable like you don't care for ANY of them when they get picked off I didn't get sad unlike the first alien that has real dialogue spoken by real people and in this even speaks like they are god when they have a mind set of a 5 year old. I'm fine with leaving open ended questions inception did that but that movie was solid the whole way through this is really anticlimactic and not only does it leave 99.9% questions unanswered it also has a really horrible narritave that has characters doing nonsensicle things and doing things for no reason or not exactly sure why. It is the most incoherent movie I have ever seen almost as bad as pirates of the carribean I have been trying to come up with answers for everything but can't find most of them. But I didn't hate it because the movie is visually dazziling and the 3D is the best I've ever seen and I did enjoy that but I need a solid story or else what's the point.. the writers obviously can't write looking back on what they did previously the script brings all the work and talent of this movie down. Its sad.. this movie is absolutly not scary at all the first alien is actually atmoshperic and creepy not this not at all. I want to blame the writers for making EVERYTHING in this movie incoherent but it comes to ridley scotts fault for excepting it. Ridley has been directing for almost 40 years he should have known this and the movie has bad editing too which brings it down they go from comedy to peoples faces melting off?? This movie would have been perfect with a solid script which I will point out ridley scott is vastly overrated he is a true visual visionary but when it comes to story he has yet to impress me. So that's my thought I still recommend seeing it for the talent envolved but the movie is truly anticlimactic and incoherent and really really dissapointing.. thanks a lot damon lindalof for ruining my hype for this movie and this movie is NOT AN ALIEN PREQUAL
1594135851|5.0|Excellent book!! Great follow up to the Hunger Games. Unpredictable story line leaves you unable to put the book down.

0547569653|5.0|After reading Born to Run my hopes were high for Scott Jurek's book... and he did not disappoint!I felt like I was left hanging a bit after the first chapter, (I wanted to know what happened immediately), but the book unfolds nicely. The recipes are enticing. I think it would have been good to have them listed together at the end,initially I skipped over some to get to the next chapter, but I must admit I've reached for more plant based foods since finishing the book(Omega Popcorn - yum). What struck me the most was Scott's willpower, I was left feeling inspired and ready to run at the end of pretty much every chapter - and more than once I've thought of his trials and perseverance as I found myself out pushing things a bit on a long run... as Scott says \\"Rational assessments often lead to rational surrenders\\".<br />All in all it's a solid read - definitely recommended.
0439023521|4.0|This book has great pacing, flows naturally and keeps you on the edge of your seat. But, it also gives to time to relax as a reader with well placed downtime. It's good emotional story with a few surprising twists and turns. A great read for teens and adults. I liked it a lot but wasn't blown away, a solid four, close to a five.
B0086700CM|5.0|great great great app. super fun. get it. now. so fun. so so fun. just get it. now. a must get. play it now. download now. hurry.
B007P06DJ0|4.0|Loved this album always and the resin I wanted to pick the anniversary copy. Unfortunately got a copy with a manufacturing defect. Pressing was bad with vinyl appearing melted in areas. Cost of shipping this back vs ordering another is a decision I would need to take! First such experience after ordering a many vinyl albums from Amazon! :(<br /><br />This is an album deserving a 5 star rating. But the rating above is for the product I received. (To avoid any confusion!)<br /><br />Amazon sent another copy to me quickly. No need to replace the old damaged copy , which saved me hassle of sending it back by international post. The new copy is great no issues at all and I am now a happy man. The end result was not bad finally other than the time for the replacement to reach me.<br /><br />Thank you Amazon for this great service and you have retained a happy customer.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|this game is great fun and extremely additive. I couldn't put it down until I cleared all the chest. definitely worth the money.
B001DPC4SM|4.0|One of his best, wanted to collect this copy for many years so getting this finally was great in vinyl!
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|This book is a fascinating story of someone born and raised in a North Korean prison camp.  His only crime was being born.  The inhumanity and crimes of the North Korean regime are manifest for the world to see in this book.  This book sheds light on the North Korean criminal regime which has been able to hide it's crimes for decades.  This is a must read.
B0086700CM|5.0|so much fun! I absolutely love this game. as soon as I downloaded it I spent three hours playing. I just wish all the extras didn't cost as much coins as some times its had to rack them up
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I like it. My daughter loves it. def will give her something to do while on long road trips. cute.
030788743X|5.0|My.  My, oh my!  You'd have to be one nano-hearted, micro-visionary, \\"gone are the days of my youth\\" human being not to tumble for this rollicking story of young adults taking on both the real and the virtual Universe at the same time.<br /><br />I won't bore you with the details of the intricate and mega-twisting plot, except to say that it is intelligent, and more fun than ten consecutive rides on the world's largest roller coasters.  And to say that all though the entire story is told through the eyes of a teenager, I (in my seventh decade of life), loved the entire story enough to neglect everything on my ever-lengthy \\"to do\\" list to devote full attention to finding out what the heck was going to happen next.<br /><br />I will leave you with a thought, though.  In an increasingly fragmented society, one in which traditional methods of identifying the values by which one lives one's life are increasingly discarded, one wonders, how DO young people learn to read their moral compasses.  And one way is by reading books like Ready Player One.  Honesty.  Integrity.  Loyalty.  Respect for all regardless of ethnic background or sexual preference.  Justice. Sharing of wealth.  Kindness.  Focus on who a person is, rather than what they look like.  A notion of romantic love NOT built solely on the yearning to exchange genetic material (i.e. sex).  Celebration of rowdy creativity, valuing education deeply, heck, even Shakespeare gets several nods.  And, in a theme rarely expressed in 21st century lit:  success comes by dint of very, VERY hard work, not by winning a lottery, or entitlement.<br /><br />But let me step away from all that philosophy:  Ready Player One is one fine adventure, an almost Arthurian tale with a private chat room instead of a Round Table, seasoned with intelligence, creativity, and delightfully basted in the values that would make the real world that we live in a finer place to be.
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|it is a great game for any one. I suggest. that you buy this game.it is very very very very  good
B00846TRHY|3.0|It was okay. It was good for giving a glimpse of what goes on there and bringing awareness. It didn't quite feel real though and I never really got emotionally into, even though it was based on a real story and there were some graphic violent scenes that should have made me feel something...I don't think the acting or dialogue was that believable.  One example, the guy gets out of prison and his wife comes to get him and they make a point of showing how she doesn't smoke, drink, strip, etc. anymore...then cut to scene of her riding him in a car on a street with others passing by.  They seemed really bent on making sure we saw her in that light while at the same time playing up how she's found God and church and it was cheesy. For me, it was one of those movies where you are aware in each scene of the actors instead of losing yourself in the story.<br />Overall it was worth the watch, but there was something missing that would connect me to the story being told.
B007Y36K46|1.0|Seriously... this is the worst movie I have ever seen. It made NO sense, the acting was terrible, and the CGI was awful. I would give it fewer stars if I could. Basically it's like Uwe Boll tried to direct a mashup of A Bug's Life, Dune, Star Wars, Land of the Lost, and Stargate.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|me,my brother,and his girlfriend went to see the midnight premiere of the avengers and i couldnt stop talking about it. It is by far my favorite marvel movie and my favorite movie. it has a whole in it for everyone it is romantic it has action it has comedy,Adventure,Fantasy,a little drama,and Science Fiction. so if u are thinking of getting a movie I would highly recommend getting the evengers. I hope u all enjoy this movie :)(:
B007JM4CWY|4.0|I've been solving these puzzles for years, whenever they would appear in the Games magazine. I've found a site or two online which has good puzzles (ConceptisPuzzles.com calls them \\"pic-a-pix\\" puzzles), but this is the first Android app I've seen that was executed well. I've only played it on my HTC Incredible, and it can be somewhat of a nuisance on the small screen, but I'm not sure what the developer could do to alleviate that. Zooming in works well, but then you have to scroll back and forth to check the numbers. I imagine it would work much better on a tablet where you could use a stylus.<br />I'd like to see some smaller puzzles at the more challenging difficulty levels, since people on smartphones have trouble with the larger puzzles due to screen size.<br />Other than the issue with using the app on a smartphone, my only other suggestion would be to add color puzzles. When doing these on paper, black and white is easiest since you generally want to use pencil, but in a digital app that's not an issue. (I wouldn't do away with B&W ones completely- it's a different kind of challenge.)
B004EBUXSA|5.0|It's actually fairly amazing to me just the shear amount of power contained within this processor. At times, I'm worried the box in my room will become sentient and upload the launch codes or something, bringing about the doom of mankind. Until that happens, however, I will continue to play my games at ultra high settings with the highest resolution (as a side note, that's also with an EVGA GTX 560 ti SC on board) and make videos to document such feats.<br /><br />I highly recommend this processor for the enthusiast who wants to be able to brag to his friends and bring about the end of the world.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|I got this app for free over a year ago through FAOTD. Most apps that I've grabbed through the promo last a month or so, then I either find something I like better or decide I can live without due to their memory requirement (I have the original HTC Incredible and frequently need to free up space). This is one of the few apps that is still on my phone a year later.<br /><br />The number and type of widgets available are great. I typically keep a small one as an agenda (which is scrollable!) on my main screen and a larger one with a week view on a secondary screen. Originally I hated having to scroll through what felt like hundreds of Business Calendar size options anytime I wanted to add a widget to my screen, but you can mark some (or most) of them as unavailable in the app settings, and then they won't show up in the list after you reboot your phone.<br /><br />The app is intuitive, and like at least one other reviewer mentioned, the preview when you're adding an event is a huge plus. There are a huge number of options for layout within the app and in the widgets, including color schemes of the widgets and changing the colors for individual calendars.<br /><br />All in all, this is an app I would certainly pay for, though $5 may be a bit high.
B007AJFSJW|5.0|This is a must read for anyone who cares about this country! Paul Krugman really knows what he is talking about. I could'nt put it down!
0345803485|3.0|I liked it, BUT, it goes on and on...ending sucked, but caused me to buy the next book. Very clever.
B0086700CM|5.0|Oh my gosh I have been waiting for this app on Kindle Fire and now I can barely even put it down!
B007MDB71O|5.0|I didn't read any reviews but I recall seeing low ratings... then went to see it in style at a GoldClass.  My wife and I were simply blown away.  I then took my 8 year old son to the IMAX... he loved it.  We all went again to the 3d, again, it held up.<br /><br />Rented the Amazon Instant Video HD last night... amazing yet again on the tv.  I just went out and bought the physical copy.<br /><br />I, along with all the hundreds of others, am sad by the mess that Disney made of the marketing work.  After all that effort on the flawless film they threw it away.<br /><br />*BUT*, here is the thing:  The movie stands perfectly on its own.  The ending does NOT beg for a sequel... it leaves you ready to dream about it all yourself.<br /><br />A sequel means JarJar Binx and talking dog sidekicks and pandering to the merchandising.  How many sequels truly don't make a story fall apart (aside from Aliens).  Disney would have just done what they did with Pirates and it would have been a shame.<br /><br />So the bad management after the production actually is a good thing.<br /><br />This is a classic, all by itself.  Cudos to the makers of THIS MOVIE.  Out-standing.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|This game sucks you do the same lame thing all over again and again. yeah&hellip; you get different birds with different powers&hellip; but its so boring. Most people can say 'it was fun for a minute's but&hellip; on this game&hellip; sadly&hellip; I can't say that it was fun for any time at all. maybe this game is for you. but not me
B007SGM084|5.0|Grr, I wish I had written this!  It's everything you want it to be plus more:  Smart, funny (I've never laughed so hard as those emails at work \\"twitching palms\\", oh, my!), romantic and of course, oh, so sexy.<br /><br />This supposedly came from the internet writing forum Fan Fiction.  I've written some stories (just for the vampire tv series Moonlight) and tried to be exactly what She (the author) has done here.<br /><br />It was a great read and now I'm intrigued that she has written something about Christian's side of the story.<br /><br />I heartily recommend this book and love this author.  May she have many more successes.  I will certainly be checking for her next trilogy.
B0086700CM|5.0|Wooooooooooooooow. this is so much fun. Sure,  it is one of those games that you have to start at the beginning when you loose, but,  you keep trying to break yours and your friends records,  unlock new people and gadgets and have a load of temple run fun!:)
B007PVHBHC|5.0|Despite it being 7 years since her last album, Patti Smith hasn't lost a beat. Top to bottom, \\"Banga\\" is a beautiful album. Considering Patti's writing career as well, the lyrics have depth and construct vivid stories. Combined with poignant instrumentation, you have great songs. Grab this album! It's one of my favorites this year and sounds even better on vinyl!
B004XNGKBS|2.0|Would pay 8-20$ for a reliable, app. Password protected. But above ALL the hand written version. I want a journal I can see my very personal touch. We have art programs I can write on.

B0086700CM|4.0|Like the game a lot. Becomes very habit forming after a few plays. Still learning how to use items purchased from the store but overall this is a great game.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is classic! it is very addicting too! plus its free....what is better than that?! I suggest you all buy temple run today! it fits all. ages!
0140180761|2.0|This book is written with 4 different narrators.  I liked the voice of the first, but could not get past the second.  One more book labeled as a wonderful classic that seemed better in memory of other people than in my actual reading.  I sometimes think the label \\"classic\\" is some kind of joke played by English teachers; so many \\"great books\\" are so universally disliked.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|this game is so much fun! I love playing it. I need more neighbors though, so add me please :) my id is: Veronicag2125 I always gift and tip back!
B00846REIS|4.0|I really enjoyed this book after reading Fifty Shades I was wasn't thinking I would find another I really liked as much, the only thing I wished is I would of found it after all of the the series was out waiting has to be the worse!
B005LAIGNC|3.0|THe director should have been taken to the woods and shot.<br />He made a good story with great effects terrible. THe acting was either over the top or deep in muck. I wish it had more weapon facts in it. The music score seemed almost silly, and louder than it should be. THe last scene when the planes went guns blazing at each other was ridiculas. If any type of WW2 Historian was used , they should have taken him to the woods as well. Being brought up by my Grandparents i got to hear so much of the war and took to reading a lot of it, THe ME 262 was a plane out of the league of any prop plane in that era. I hate to burst anyones bubble , but i cant fanthom that in the movies scence with them, they were all shot down so easily. THe Jets had 30mm cannons! and shot from far to escape the range of the 12.7mm machine guns that the allies used. they would sweep down make a past , fly past make a turn and do it again at 500MPH , at that time nothing could catch them. The ME 262 suffered from mechcanical problems and they were shot down mostly by pure luck and having engine problems. If the germans had not introduced this fighter so late in the war it would have changed the tide of the airwar but not the ground where PAtton did the finest job in history.<br />PS only top german ace piots flew these and would have shot from way out if they wanted to play chicken.<br />even though this movie was emphasizing on racism during the 40's which was entirely correct, and which all AMericans should be ashamed of. This movie was just so poorly scripted i concentrated more on the planes than anything else.<br />BUT - the flying was incredible!!!-cheers to the computer boys.
B004132HZS|5.0|A far better update than the trite new Sherlock Holmes films with Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law. It's difficult to say exactly why this series is so great, but I'll try. It manages, due to excellent, intelligent scripts, to capture exactly what makes the Holmes stories so entertaining without slavishly reproducing them. Secondly, the casting of Holmes and Watson is superb. Cumberbatch IS Sherlock Holmes -- in fact, he's my favorite since Christopher Plummer. I'm one of the few who don't appreciate Jeremy Brett's interpretation which I consider too bitchy and cold. This Holmes is likable and fascinating despite his quirks. One really must pay attention, however. The scripts are intricate and keep everything moving at a fast clip. It's also refreshing to see that Lestrade, played by the always excellent Rupert Graves, isn't portrayed as the bumbling fool he is in the originals. The updates all work. Having Watson recounting Sherlock's adventures on a blog is brilliant! And boy, is Moriarty a surprise! Watch this!
B005LAIIRQ|1.0|Im sure there are films that are alot worse than THe Grey....but they havent been released yet ;) See what I did there. Anyways, this movie is a waste of time and money on all levels. Here is the breakdown.<br /><br />Story Doesnt add up. Main character wants to kill himself but live first through the plane crash?<br />The Characters in the story are all pieces of trash and you hate each one of them.<br />The Characters go from being 100 percent scum bags to angels right before the wolfs eat them.<br />The Wolfs are CGI.<br />The WRiter should stop writting as of this movie.<br /><br />I wish the wolfs would have eaten them all in the first 5 min of the film that way I could have made more of my night like not watching The Grey.This movie doesnt have anything good about it, and no real crowd to watch it. Dont waste your time or money.

B0055MBQOM|4.0|Once again I've had to return to my review here (and there are much better ones that have been written by others a bit more familiar with calibration than I am). I'm purchasing this now for the second time. Let's put it this way, X-Rite COULD make a stronger cable, since if the one here gets yanked a bit too hard, forget your investment, and don't count on hearing back from X-Rite very soon if you write to them about it. I looked at other models (including Spyder) and read better reviews and decided this one is still the best for the money. I'd note however and in response to some reviews I read that it has not been my experience that this device will somehow adjust your displays white point. If it does, I don't know when it does. Maybe this is due to working with an Apple Cinema display, which (stupidly) has no contrast adjustment. Only brightness can be adjusted on the hardware. In the end, what matters most is how good your display is, commentaries notwithstanding. If you can afford $5,000, then you'll probably get a better correlation between display and print out, probably regardless of which of these calibrators you use. But I was used to using this device and so bought it again, while feeling some considerable pain in the wallet. (BTW, there are con artists at eBay trying to sell this thing for up to $230. Watch out at eBay.)<br /><br />Original Review:<br /><br />I was a little tough on the little munki in another review elsewhere and which I can't edit. I'm going to make up for that here if Amazon will allow. I'd noted that the Colormunki wasn't so easy to use and that's still true. It's not because it can be so confusing when it sends up different menus depending on the current state of your display. Displays differ, of course, and so people will get different results (and menus) depending on what display they have.<br /><br />I have both an Apple Cinema (20&#34;) LED and a Samsung (17&#34;) LCD. Until buying the Colormunki I was using a Huey Pro II, also from X-Rite/Pantone.<br /><br />First I ought note that in any event the concept of the Colormunki from a practical standpoint is already a lot better than that of the Huey Pro, which uses suction cups to keep the device attached to the screen. (For any concerned, the Huey never left and permanent damage, but it does leave marks on a display after use--assuming one had to press hard enough to keep the thing from falling off during gaging. But no permanent damage.) The Colornunki instead employs a counterweight method that I like a whole lot better, though one must be sure to take care that the device lays flat against the screen lest measurements be worthless. Any light getting in from outside will render measurements worthless.<br /><br />Like the Huey, the Colormunki is also capable of ambient light monitoring though at only five-minute intervals (shortest time available) instead of two-minute ones with the Huey Pro. I don't notice as much change in the display when using the Colormunki as I did with the Huey. With the Huey, changing light in the room resulted in a very noticeable change on the display. Not so with the Colormunki, so I remain skeptical of the Colormunki's capability with respect to ambience monitoring. Not that I think that so important, but it's a nice feature, even for someone who like me works mostly in the dark. In a brightly lit room or office one might have more of a problem.<br /><br />I'd complained in my previous review of not noticing much of a change in my display after going through all the steps, and that too remains true. But I'd also complained of the fact that, also like the Huey, since this applies to both devices, getting brightness and contrast right is the trickiest (and most important) part. The Apple has no contrast control (too my never-ending annoyance while the Samsung allows very fine control over everything.<br /><br />With these less expensive models of calibrators X-Rite/Pantone can't seem to be very bothered with arranging things such that one can get brightness and contrast right from the outset. No doubt with the more expensive devices the problems are more directly addressed and finer adjustments are possible. (Personally, I think $160 is enough to have to pay for one of these things, especially given the prices for everything else one needs to create a consistent color workflow.)<br /><br />I wrote my first review too soon. When things weren't looking too good I finally decided to start over at much lower brightness levels on both displays. Up popped different menus--this time--asking that I make some adjustments, especially to the Samsung, but to the Apple as well. In the case of the Apple I wound up setting the brightness to 0, that is, reducing brightness until I could do so no further (which the software indicated was perfectly acceptable if necessary). On the Samsung--and the Colormunki seemed to know I have two different types of displays--I was asked to increase and then reduce brightness to certain levels, which I did.<br /><br />I should note that contrast is hardly addressed, if at all, in either case, not with the Huey and not with the Colormunki. In both cases a clumsy method (eyeball comparison) is all that's available in order to adjust contrast, which, as I noted, can't be done with the Apple Cinema in any case. But this business of making contrast adjustments until one image (put up by the software) matches another is just dumb. That's no scientific way to go about adjusting contrasts on displays. One might just as well use in-built methods for both Mac and Windows for all the contrast-adjusting part of the process is worth using either Huey or Colormunki. I just set the Samsung to 75% contrast and left it.<br /><br />But since recalibrating with minimal brightnesses, adjusted only slightly, for both displays both of my displays are now--finally and at long last--displaying colors that are pretty damn close to prints I make.<br /><br />The Colormunki, unlike the Huey, allows setting white point, which is important though you'll never learn why from the far-too-brief instructions provided by X-Rite. In general, instructions for both devices would warrant one-star ratings at best. They're truly terrible at explaining anything, i.e., like what you're doing, let alone why you're even bothering. Instead of defaults I set white points for both displays to &#34;native.&#34; Because I think that's best as a matter of common sense. One is working with THIS display and not displays in general.<br /><br />But I now have what appear to be color-cast-free, clear and not-too-bright displays to work with--since setting brightnesses to zero for the Apple and just slightly brighter for the Samsung.  All along, including while using the Huey, for which software is worthy only of starting fires, my screens were far too bright while all my prints looked too dark. But it never stood to reason to reduce brightness on the Apple to zero. Doing so makes whites look fairly grimy, but I don't care about that anymore now that my prints look like what's on my display--within reason, of course, and outside a D-50 light-box. For those less experienced at this, prints will never look exactly like images on displays, because displays backlight images whereas prints are not usually backlit but lit only reflectively--by the light falling upon them.<br /><br />The problem of trying to get an image displayed on a computer display to match one on paper is not solvable. One is really talking apples and oranges, and unlike even those, the twain shalll never meet. Writers on these topics often carry on as though it were really possible to make the two match when the very idea is absurd. They can't do it and neither can you or anyone else.<br /><br />So, if you're having any problems getting things to match, think lower brightness, which is likely to solve your problem. I'd always read that brightness should never be lower than when white looks pure white, notin the least dimmed or &#34;dirty.&#34; That's not true either. Otherwise you might also consider setting your white points to native instead of leaving them at defaults or even setting them to what's &#34;recommended.&#34;<br /><br />Turns out the Colormunki's not so bad after all, which doesn't mean it still couldn't be better. I won't give it 5 stars, and 3 and a half would be closest.<br /><br />One more thing: When I first bought the Colormunki, the ambient monitoring would not load properly on start up, not in Snow Leopard and not in Windows XP. (I run both on a Mac Pro.)  Same problem with the Huey, by the way. Since purchase I discovered that X-Rite or Pantone had posted fixes. Previously they were recommending another clumsy work-around, especially for Mac, wherein nothing loaded. With Windows, the thing would load but always with an error message. The problem had to do with order in which devices or software start up when the computer is brought up, turned on or awakened. At first X-Rite recommended a little start-up program that would allow one to readjust start-up order in Windows. Nothing but starting up the Colormunki app was recommended for Mac. (One has open the app and then close it before an icon appears in Mac's version of systray.)  Then came the fixes, which I downloaded for both Mac and PC. (Oh, that little start-up program previously recommended? Not such a good idea. I'd not recommend messing with it.)<br /><br />The fix for PC works, no more error message on start up and the monitor loads properly in systray. No such luck with the Mac fix. It does nothing whatsoever near as I can discern and so I still have to start the app and then close before the ambient light monitoring will start up. X-Rite seems to have all kinds of problems writing simple software for OS X. Naturally, I work mostly in Mac mode, having largely abandoned PC mode, which I keep around only for old docs and images and for work purposes, the fix for Mac is the one that doesn't work.<br /><br />By the way, after you've finished calibrating there's an option someplace--obvious--where one can set which kind of monitor to which one would prefer the profile be applied. There's a list, which I don't have at hand, but it appears at the end of the process, from which one can use from among three or four types. I seem to recall there was one for LED, which is different than and LCD. X-Rite notes that choosing one or another correctly will slightly improve performance. I'd hope and think so!!instructions provided by X-Rite. In general, instructions for both devices would warrant one-star ratings at best.

0345803485|1.0|I don't even know why this is popular. I got through about a third before wanting to give up and then got halfway before chucking the book across the room. I read to the end eventually, but wished I'd hadn't.
B007R12TNQ|3.0|The Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked was an ok movie. It is interesting for children. My 18 month old son enjoyed the songs but the plot was a little too advanced for him to follow. It definitely has adult oriented themes, but is still ok for younger viewers. I did enjot=y the first two movies more than this one.
0439023521|5.0|I didn't read the other seven thousand something reviews--so my apologies for repeating what reviewer number 6,435 said. Or reviewer number 2,223. The number of reviews should be clue enough that this story is excellent.  This brusque, somewhat macabre, book is compelling. Fast paced! Good for a reader of any age (I'm 51). Enough said.<br /><br />What I did like about the story is the return to the wild theme. Should this book encourage some indoor-bound, cell phone texting, Taco Bell munching Adolescent to venture outdoors and actually see a squirell or track down a turkey, then this book has done what many a frustrated parent could not do: Go get the kids to play outside! And should a kid decide that a bit of wilderness is worth saving because of this book, then I'd say that Collins has done what Muir, Abbey and Leopold have not been able to do.

I highly recommend this app, (which is free, by the way), to anybody who enjoys a fun little game to enjoy.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This book is AMAZING AND SOOOO DESCRPTIVE,it's hard to put it down to get stuff done during the day!

B000EXDS5M|4.0|Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid rode together in the late 1890's, during the twilight years of the golden west. This 1969 film, made the same year as Lawrence Kasdan's \\"The Wild Bunch\\" highlighted the same theme--the final days of relative freedom for the bank robber.<br /><br />As railroads flourished and ranches became fenced, modernization encroached on the rustler and bank robber's ability to escape from the law. The film spends 27 minutes in a chase scene, with the Pinkertons (the Super Posse) running Butch and Sundance 500 miles and finally to Bolivia. Paul Newman and Robert Redford provide the realism and comedic moments that carry the life and times of...very well.<br /><br />Disc 2 provides plenty of information of the real Butch Cassidy and the real Sundance Kid. Commentaries are heard from Paul Newman and Robert Redford about how the actors were chosen over others like Steve McQueen, Marlon Brando, even Jack Lemon. A sister of Butch Cassidy tells tales of the times.<br /><br />The music by Burt Bacharach won an academy award and amazes to this day how modern themes can support an old fashioned set movie.<br /><br />Fewer westerns came along afterwards, and that marked the beginning of winding down Hollywood's western era.<br /><br />Very good movie and worth the money.

0307346617|5.0|Max Brooks' novel World War Z is head and shoulders above the other best zombie novels. The professionalism and maturity of this book stands out from the beginning, unlike so many other zombie novels that have clearly been written by immature and/or untalented writers. And the unique style of the book adds to its fascination.<br /><br />WWZ by Brooks is set in time 10 years after the UN has declared victory in the zombie war. About 1 percent of humanity has survived overall, although some countries fared much better than others. The book is a recounting of the war in chronological order of events through interviews given to survivors who were present at critical times and places. The reader is presented with scores of individuals telling their haunting stories in context of the war's history.<br /><br />If you only read one zombie novel, this is the one. Other horror novels have been declared classics (i.e. Dracula, Frankenstein and The House of the Seven Gables). Brooks' novel should be declared a classic.

1609613937|5.0|this book can change you life for the better and healthier. a great read and convincing argument for eating starches for life and enjoying it too.  forget all the other \\"diet \\" books.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I give it only 4 stars because from time to time the ads are a bit much and some of the controls for only a few games are glitchy. Turning off wi-fi clears up the ad issue right away though. As far as the games costing too many points there are some times when you can unlock them for half the points. I just collect as many as I can until then. Over all for a free game it is defonitally worth the down load!
B005LAIGTG|5.0|I love the story behind this movie even before I saw the movie which I love so ,When the Blu ray edition came out I had to have it to add to my collection. This is a movie for Anyone that has ever been in Love or wants to be in Love, It renews you hope that True love does exist and flourishes in today's crazy world
B00062PN6I|4.0|They sound as good as you could expect for what I paid.  One flaw.  It seems whoever designed these and actually wired them up and labeled left and right got it mixed up.  Put these on the correct way with the L and R respectively to the correct ears.  Very uncomfortable to me, the cups don't sit flat on my head and leaves a huge space at the back of my ears. (my head is normal from what I can gather)  Turn them around so that L and R is on the wrong ears, they fit perfect. ?????? So, in short if you wear these backwards they are great.  (this goes against everything I know) Also, could be annoying with movies or gaming with the L and R backwards.  The included 1/4\\" adapter is nice but the screw on feature is a little weird.

I streamed the movie and it kept jumping back to the beginning or freezing up the entire time. It ended taking me almost four hours to watch the whole thing piece by piece. I intend to rent or purchase the movie and watch again in the very near future without interruption. This was my first time streaming a movie from Amazon and I was less than pleased and will most likely not do it again...fail!!!

B003F1LQWC|2.0|Glad I saw this for free with Amazon Prime. The acting in this move was beyond pathetic. It seems the goal of this movie was to explain the Celestine Prophecy. It fails miserably. Ater watching this movie, I had no idea until the end what it actually was about. They explained the 9 parts of it in writing, right before the credits. It did not explain how you get to this specialized evolutionary state, just that you have to open yourself up. Achieving the level of spirituality described in this movie would take many, many years of prayer, meditation, and dedication to the faith. One would not be able to fall into it like the main character in this movie. I really would not recommend this movie to anyone.

B007R21JJK|5.0|What can i say about this motherboard. For the price you cant go wrong. Using it along with an Intel i7-2600K and it boots fast with the great Z77 chipset. Very sturdy design, great UEFI BIOS design, lots of ports video ports once your using K series Intel. Alot of USB 3.0 ports, just beware during a windows installation the USB 3.0 ports will not work until you install the system drivers that come with the motherboard. You can simply use the front USB 2.0 port on your case to avoid the inconvenience. I would have liked more Sata 3 ports but for the price, this is a must buy for someone who doesnt need a Sabertooth or unnecessarily pricey Asus boards.

B007EVQAFC|3.0|Huge Alice fan, been to a bunch of shows, & seen this particular tour...so I know the band was rocking. However...this is just an \\"Instant Live\\" version of the tour, meaning it was mixed during the show and given to people that bought it, then that version was burned on to CD and sold as this product.<br /><br />The mix is awful. Don't know what else to say. Alice's vocal is overpowering at times. Out of the 3 guitars, you mainly hear one louder than the others, and certain solos aren't turned up (ex. listen to Clones). If this was properly mixed, it would probably be my favorite AC live album (mainly due to Orianthi on lead and the setlist in general)<br /><br />If you don't care about sound, it's a great CD! If you know a thing or two about mixing, I'd stay away.<br /><br />5 stars for the content, 1 star for the sound quality...3 stars overall.
B0059WTMLW|1.0|The choice to include Open Feint or anything like it shoes grave disconnect between this developer and its customers. Having Open Feint installed (and whatever assumed financial kickback they get) is obviously more important than customer loyalty and trust, thus the dev deserves the low rating by their own choice. Please learn, developers.

B007L3BMGA|1.0|This book is one of the most annoying reads I've had for awhile. The author assumes the reader has no capacity to remember the previous chapters, is repetitive and lazy. The style of the book is that aimed at a very young reader, although the content obviously is not. Patronizing style, author need s to either grow up ( are they a teenager?) or lose the attitude that the reader is an idiot. Do not bother

The beginning was a little funny, different from typical romances, entertaining.  Halfway through, I wnated a refund.  As other reviews say, VERY repetative, Very Very repetative.  I agree with other that it must have been written by a european teen.  I have not finished this book, and probably will never finish.  Just one more for the archive file.

1439127700|5.0|I gave this to my husband as a birthday present.  He has really enjoyed reading it.  I usually have a problem finding him something to read because he reads for facts.  Well this is full of facts and stories of life behind the doors of the big white house.

0345803485|5.0|HOT summer reading.  Good thing it's been cool outside.  I have found myself wondering who will play the people in the book in the movie.  Oh yes there has to be a movie or three.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I wish this app worked. ive been wanting to play it but I cant. super hummed out. hope it gets worked out soon. there is no other game this cool on the marketplace. fix it! pretty please.
B0086700CM|5.0|everybody knows this game. why am I writing a review? however it does lag, but its most likely just this device. anyway great game definitely reccomend it everyone should probably have it, a backup you know whenever you get bored.

B006VFLIYK|5.0|This is another great novel by David Baldacci.  I've read his entire collection and this is right up there with the best. I wish he would publish more than one a year.  I'm addicted to his writing.
B00881VLCE|5.0|love this for any age or gender fun to play and no worry about losing pieces or having to clean up. cute puzzles to choose from.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|very involved game that keeps you coming back for more. if you are looking to just kill time this may not be the game for you.
B007SGM084|1.0|I am not one to give up on a book but the immature writing combined with a topic which is so masochistic just turns my stomach and rolls my eyes. If  I have to hear one more time about the &#34;heroines&#34; &#34;inner Goddess&#34; I think I will puke! She is about as far from a woman who would use that term (over and over) as a woman can get. Seriously, don't  waste your money. If I could I would give this book zero stars.
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|This is a great addicting game with hours of fun!! Glad i got it while free but still worth tthe dollar it cost
B0086700CM|4.0|i really love thiis game! it is really addictive :) but when you are on a roll and your trying to get your high score... it gliches and you die...
0061906220|5.0|A teacher at the elementary school I work at showed me the book and it quickly became,not just my favorite, but the whole schools! I read it to all that would listen.  We even had 2 classes perform his sequel, \\"Groovy Buttons\\" at the talent show. Pete teaches valuable life lessons - \\"it's all good\\" - I can't wait until the fall so I can introduce Pete to a whole new group of Kindergarteners!
B005K17RU0|4.0|great app but ot has a few issues on kindle fire. it will freeze a lot. other than that I love it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game has all different types of games in it u have unlock and play the game to find out if its fun or not. its kind of like a mistery u don't know if ill like or not so I would recommend this app to anyone. :)
B0052RE4MQ|1.0|This book is horrible. Loved matched but the whole book could have been written in one short chapter.  Felt that the book had a lot of useless filler. You would be better off reading a summary of the book.I will still read the third book just because I finish what I start. I will do what the author didn't do and end my review here. I hope the last book is concise and not filled with hundreds of pages of fluff.
B0086700CM|5.0|Hello Im Bailey this game has brought me to my feet it keeps me young well im not being a 21 year old is harder than u think especially when you have 5 kids already! !
1469984202|5.0|This is seriously sooo frakking good - I couldn't put it down.  Absolutely perfect.  I can't wait to read #6 and then the author's other books!  Read it, now!  You will be glad you did.  I read CONSTANTLY and I am pretty sure this is my first ever book review - it's that good.  :~)
1609611543|5.0|This is an enjoyable read but critical and a little worrisome.  I think everyone should read it.  Dr. Davis keeps his sense of humor though out, and it is easy to understand.
0345803485|2.0|As a retired counselor for abused women, this is the same old story. I was abused, therefore I will beat the crap out of you(I love you) and then be soooo sorry. Boo f..ing hoo. It's not a romantic or excusable \\"love\\" no matter how you look at it. Hoping that no one will think it is.
0345803485|2.0|The sex scenes are hot, the writing is not.<br /><br />After hearing all the hype surrounding this book and as an erotic book reader, I had to find out for myself.  I could have purchased all three books at the same time, but I decided to purchase them individually.  I'm glad I did as I only managed to read the first two before I gave up.<br /><br />The writing is TERRIBLE!  Ugh.  It reads like an 18 year old wrote it.  I understand that EL James is not a professional writer and I can appreciate her courage in entering the realm of erotica on her first time out.  Having said that, the sex scenes are hot, albeit less than believable.  Anna not only orgasms every single time she's with Christian, she orgasmed her first time and has rocking, earth shattering orgasms every single time after that.  A nice fantasy but...<br /><br />I'm not into BDSM and that, I'm sure, is where most of the allure for this novel comes from (sex toy sales have never been more brisk!).  My husband has been the beneficiary of this novel and I have indeed added a few more toys to my collection.  Men are calling into radio shows saying their sex lives have never been better.  For that, we women and our husbands thank you EL James.<br /><br />If you're not into BDSM, this might not be the book for you but it will wet your appetite and turn you on.  Having said that, there are far better erotic authors out there such as Lacey Alexander or Megan Hart.<br /><br />But, what the heck!  If woman around the world are embracing and enjoying their new found sexuality, bring it on!!!
B004ZWKWQQ|5.0|My wife and I put this together over 3 evenings. It was tons of fun! I grew up playing with legos and putting this together as an adult was at least as fun as it was then. The shuttle, fuel tank, and boosters are all pretty durable individually, but the connections between them are a bit weak. You have to play with it all together with 2 hands, so the shuttle gets flown around by itself quite a bit.<br /><br />One thing that surprised me was that the pieces aren't all white and black. There are yellow, red, and blue pieces and you'd never know. There are lots of little pieces and a bunch of unique ones. I think this set has a lot of replay value if you like to build your own stuff after you finish the instructions. It is basically the ultimate DIY airplane kit.<br /><br />I expected the fully assembled shuttle with the tank and boosters to sit on the launch pad precariously, but it is very stable. I couldn't get it to tip over until I really pushed it. Loved this set. I'm going to be buying more of these larger Lego sets in the future.
0345803493|2.0|Another badly written but highly entertaining novel.<br /><br />Don't get too excited people.  The writing still sucks but the sex is still good!  These novels are like a train wreck.  You can't stop looking.  You know you shouldn't but you can't help it.  I didn't quite devour this second novel as much as the first.  I ploughed through the first one in a couple of days.  This one took a bit longer and I have no intention of reading the third.<br /><br />SPOILER:<br />Full disclosure: I'm a childfree woman living the childfree life of no kids, no pressure and no stress.  When I found out - totally by mistake (damn you Twitter) that Anna has not one but two babies, I said, \\"Oh well, there goes another story line that's ruined by children.\\"  Really?  Why did EL James have to go and ruin a perfectly good fantasy by bringing children into it?  And it's not just because I live the CF life that I was turned off, but the mere thought of these two sexually charged adults who enjoy bondage and nipple clips and butt plugs having kids, really turned me off.<br /><br />Fantasy is fantasy.  Let's not get all touchy-feely by bringing real life into it.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is awesome app it has great graphics &amp; I can even pause it its the best game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0920668364|5.0|I first heard this book used in our children's church. It kept a large group of children, ages four to ten, focused on the story and the pictures.  Many of the adults in the church that day were similarily attentive.  Excellent story. It left all with a timeless lesson. I have now sent to my sons to read to their children.
B0059WTMLW|5.0|As others noted, the author allows you to turn off the open feint if it bothers you. Great for playing on the Kindle.
B004NSVF7C|4.0|Allison Bartlett didn't, by any means, take on the world's greatest thief in her book, nor does she claim to.  Nothing here is comparable to the theft of the Mona Lisa.  What she gives, instead, is a charming look at a relatively petty thief with a rather inexplicable love for books--something that many who love roaming the aisles of a library can identify with but don't carry it to the lengths of this ne'r-do-well.  While wild chase scenes and drama are missing, however, one also learns much about the book trade itself, how books come to have their value, and some of the tricks you should be wary of when considering acquiring a book of any value, such as a first edition.<br /><br />This was a very readable book that kept my interest and, along with a good yarn, taught me a few things worth passing on to others.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is solo much fun! its super fun and addicting. the goals make it worth the time you spend playing it.
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|\\"Prometheus\\" is an ambitious movie -- it wants to answer (in a sci-fi way) the questions that have haunted humanity for eons.<br /><br />And... it doesn't. This sorta-kinda-maybe prequel to the \\"Alien\\" franchise raises a lot of scientific/philosophical questions and never really answers them. But if you can bypass that, it's still a very solid, harrowing sci-fi adventure, with some powerful lead performances and truly brilliant direction by Ridley Scott.<br /><br />Dr. Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and her partner Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) have discovered ancient star maps that may lead to the Engineers, aliens responsible for making the human race. So with the funding of elderly bazillionaire Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce), they set out to a remote moon on board the Prometheus.<br /><br />Upon landing, the crew finds a vast torc-shaped spaceship, filled with the dead bodies of Engineers. But there is also a bizarre black liquid that ravages anyone who is exposed to it -- and leaves Shaw threatened by a bizarre alien life form. As she discovers the ugly true reason behind the expedition, she also finds that the Engineers are not what she expected...<br /><br />\\"Prometheus\\" can be kind of frustrating -- it has a lot of unanswered questions and dangling plot threads, and eventually it makes you feel like it's the first half of a two-part story. And there's a lot of scientific/philosophical/religious stuff that is lightly touched on, but isn't really handled in an insightful way (although it was nice to see a scientist who is also religious).<br /><br />But despite those flaws.... \\"Prometheus\\" is actually a really enjoyable movie. There's a lot of passion and earnest intensity to this movie, and it was clearly made with a lot of love.<br /><br />And Ridley Scott's direction is absolutely brilliant -- he interweaves slimy tentacled horror with sleek, shadowy sci-fi, until they are indistinguishable from each other. Everything grows more intense as the black liquid starts mutating the crew members, until the climax explodes into a chaos. Things just spiral more and more out of control, and you never quite know what's going to happen.<br /><br />You also wouldn't recognize Rapace as the girl with the dragon tattoo here -- she's elfin and luminous, with enormous expressive eyes and a mop of rumpled hair. She handles the role of Shaw beautifully -- a person who is deeply religious but also devoted to science, extremely intellectual but also very strong (particular in the... um, medical procedure scene).<br /><br />She's also flanked by awesome performances by the icy, rigid Charlize Theron and the pleasant, charming Idris Elba. But the scene-stealer is Fassbender, who plays a charming, elegant android who occasionally shows some flickers of human emotion. At times he seems soulless and cold, but then we see him watching his favorite movie or asking questions about faith.<br /><br />\\"Prometheus\\" is a riveting sci-fi story, albeit a flawed one that never answers most of our questions. Here's hoping \\"Prometheus 2\\" is a bit more satisfying.quid starts mutating the crew members, until the climax explodes into a chaos.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|Certainly not literature, but if you are in the mood for a simple erotic book this is the one.  I prefer romance with a bit more twist like [[ASIN:B0082SJRMY The Phantom King (The Kings)]] or [[ASIN:0765354586 A Nameless Witch]].
0142419516|5.0|Everyone has heard of Frankenstein's monster... or at least the Hollywood version, with green skin, boxy head and bolts in his neck.<br /><br />But the original creature is quite different in Mary Shelley's \\"Frankenstein,\\" which starts off rather slow but builds into a tragic, darkly hypnotic tale about tampering in God's domain, and the terrible consequences that come from it. Also: if you create a new creature out of dead body parts, don't disown him or he'll kill your family.<br /><br />During a trip across the Arctic, a ship picks up a starved, half-frozen man named Victor Frankenstein. As he recovers, Frankenstein tells them his life story -- especially about how he became fascinated with science, and developed a process to reanimate dead tissue. Eventually he constructs a new creature out of dead body parts, and brings him to life.<br /><br />But while the creature is intelligent and articulate, he's also hideously ugly. Horrified that he's not beautiful, Frankenstein flees... and has a nervous breakdown. Wimp.<br /><br />But months later, the murder of his little brother brings Victor back to his home, where he figures out that the creature was involved. And to his horror, the creature now wants a mate. But the loathing between them -- caused by Frankenstein's disgust and the creature's increasing bitterness -- leads to even more tragedy...<br /><br />\\"Frankenstein\\" is one of those rare novels that is almost beyond classification -- it's gothic horror, it's sci-fi, it's a tragedy about scientific ambition that goes where it shouldn't go. Mary Shelley was only eighteen years old when she began writing this book, but she interwove religion, science and a fiercely intelligent knowledge of human nature into it.<br /><br />Her writing is a bit stuffy at times (\\"All praises bestowed on her I received as made to a possession of my own\\"), but that's because it was written in the early 1800s. Despite this, Shelley's writing skills shine in the more horrific moments of the story (\\"I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs\\"), and she imbues it with a sense of painful, grimy suspense.<br /><br />But the complicated characters of Victor and the creature are what really make the story work. Victor is actually a pretty horrible person -- while he's a tragic figure whose unnatural ambitions end up destroying his wife, brother and father, he's also incredibly cruel and callous to the creature because... he's ugly.<br /><br />The creature, on the other hand, instantly gets our sympathy. He's intelligent and childlike at first, but his ugliness causes everyone to immediately hate and fear him. When him becomes embittered and eventually murderous, you still feel sorry for him.<br /><br />Mary Shelley's \\"Frankenstein\\" is one of those few, rare horror books -- it adds a little more of that scientific gothic atmosphere to a classic tale of horror, slime and sorrow.the story (\\"I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs\\"), and she imbues it with a sense of painful, grimy suspense.<br /><br />But the complicated characters of Victor and the creature are what really make the story work.

B0081JFGQU|2.0|It REALLY pains me to submit a poor review for this cd. I had so looked forward to this live recording. I've seen this band twice, and seen The Derek Trucks Band, Susan Tedeschi, and the ABB, all separately. They were all great shows and very energetic. This recording is -- gulp -- lackluster. If the song rocks, they should just rock the song. Instead, they meander off into mundane jazzy diversions that highlight their musical talent, but bore the listener after hearing it twice. Song selection could be better. They perform \\"Coming Home\\" at many of their shows, but it's not on either the studio cd or this live double disc. If you look up their Crossroads Guitar Festival performances on youtube, you'll see a band at the height of their powers (Midnight in Harlem is phenomenal at Crossroads), but they seem to have lost some energy by the time this was recorded. Bottom line: GREAT talent, and it may have been a great show to attend, but the cd is hard to listen to after a few plays. I'm sorry - I wanted to love it!
B004ZISVWC|4.0|Very well made film with good entertainment value. Starts a little slow, but I think the low energy and understated characters keep it from being silly, like many Hollywood films. Makes me curious to view more films directed by Andre Ovredal.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This second book could also have been part of a larger first book. If you liked the first one and want more of the same then this is the book for you.
B005HSL626|3.0|When I first played fruit ninjas, it was on my friends ipod. When I downloaded it here, I got the same quality as I did there. Here's the point of the game: You try to slice all the fruit. Don't hit the bombs, get all of the magic bananas at ARCADE MODE. There are three modes, ZEN MODE, CLASSIC, AND ARCADE MODE. In ZEN MODE: you just slice fruit, no bombs, just a leisure thing. CLASSIC is that you have three strikes. You get a strike if you miss one fruit and the game ends if you hit a bomb. In arcade mode, you try to avoid bombs which cuts your time limit. You have to slice the magic bananas for more bonuses.<br />  All in all, the game was entertaining, but there is seriously nothing more to do then those three levels. After you unlock all the blades, there is nothing to do. I still find this game amusing though for a person who <3's fruit.
B000TGXT0S|5.0|All this hype about relaunching the record to redo the vocals and overdubbing is crap. The new version sounds HORRID to my ears and it is the original version that sounds best. This is one of those awesome metal albums that stands the test of time like Van Halen's first, Slayer's Seasons In the Abyss, Seduce's first, King Diamond's Abigail, Metallica's Master of Puppets and so on.<br /><br />The sonic barrage that is Megadeath did a phenomenal job on this CD and my favorite track is Five Magics and then Dawn Patrol. Of course the title track Rust In Peace is pretty wicked to listen to as well. The guitars, drums, bass & vocals sound fantastic on the original.<br /><br />I bought a used CD from the early days because I wanted the original sound - like I had on my old cassette tape of the same. This new so-called 2.0 version just sucks. All Mustaine did was go back into the studio, add a bunch of echo to the drums and lay down a new set of vocals. Retarded in my opinion. His voice is not the same today as when he recorded this album. That's about as dumb as if James Hetfield went back into the studio & redid the vocals for Kill Em All and Ride the Lightning. Okay so why would that be dumb you ask? Because he was younger when those albums were produced and his voice was different. Laying down his voice from today would sound WEIRD. Bleah.<br /><br />Let's face it, Mustaine isn't talented enough to come up with material like this anymore. His ego gets in the way so he doesn't hire the right personnel to put out great cd's like he once did. Sad.<br /><br />Still this is a classic metal album and if you want to hear it as it originally sounded, buy an older, used copy. I give this album 5 out of 5 stars for the ORIGINAL and 1 out of 5 stars for the 2.0 (REMASTERED) crap.
B0086700CM|4.0|it is so cool me and my sister play all the time on the kindle it is the best game ever :-)!!!!!!!!

0920668372|5.0|My mom handed this book to me when we were on a trip to CA with my son... he was 4 years old. Of course he immediately wanted mommy to read it. I told my mom I was going to kill her when we got home! (jokingly of course), as I couldn't finish the book without crying. In fact, there's been very few times that I've read it since (and it's been MANY times) that I haven't shed a tear or two.<br /><br />For such a simple book it certainly makes it clear how simple and basic it is to love your children and to have that love returned!<br /><br />A MUST HAVE for everyone's home library where kids live!<br /><br />Here are a few of the other books my son grew up with:<br />[[ASIN:0060572345 Where the Sidewalk Ends 30th Anniversary Edition: Poems and Drawings]]<br />[[ASIN:0066236177 A Light in the Attic (20th Anniversary Edition Book & CD)]]<br />[[ASIN:0545215781 Clifford The Big Red Dog (Clifford 8x8)]]
B005AVIZ6U|3.0|Having read and thoroughly enjoyed all of the Reacher books I have to say that with this one I needed quite a a bit of discipline at times to keep reading - and then it was just to see how the story finished.<br />In previous books I've found it quite easy to suspend disbelief but really, a journalist goes missing and the place isn't crawling with newshounds?<br />Next thing is I'll have to believe Tom Cruise, and not Sean Bean, is Jack Reacher.

B0088RQ4X4|5.0|Loved this movie. Why? Well, good guys are good guys, bad guys are bad guys, and in the end... well, you know how it goes. :-) There's a romantic twist, but its tread lightly. So refreshing. There's battles, fun and interesting characters, great CG, and plot twists you just don't expect. There's only one momentary ecological jab, but I can live with that. No agenda card is overplayed either, which is equally refreshing. It's a fun, \\"Sit down to enjoy it and don't over think it\\" movie. For what it's worth, it did poorly in the major reviews after it was released. That generally means it's awesome. I kept having those, \\"Yes!\\" moments. You know the ones? Where you grit your teeth with a big grin, clench your fist, and jerkily lean forward and push a foot into the floor. I know I'll be watching it again.
B007R3AZNK|3.0|This isn't real bad but not his best. It is better than Dust Bowl which only the first 5 songs were worth listening to. This one would be ok backround music at an adult contemporary party. With Brad Whitford on the cd I was expecting some good riff trading. Not there. Do we really care if the 'caveman' has to be listed as playing tamborine and toy piano. Sit down, shut up and produce only.
B001DIDUHS|4.0|In the days when pop and glam (pomp and circumstance) was moving into the spotlight. NWOBHM was running a little thin. The ascension of Thrash was eminent. Death Metal had reached the crack of dawn. And, Black Sabbath presently turned the key to another revolution along the ensuing journey!! This is what then modern mainlevel metal ought to have sounded like: Basic real heavy melodic music, well executed. Though slightly less then perfect; how I prefer it. Grow into it. Now intriguingly inaccessible. Worth the Venture. Certainly is not Oz or Dio; and, rightly so..

B005LAIGW8|2.0|\\"This thing, there's no conscience, just hunger. The Rider's gonna come out. And when he does, he'll destroy whoever's got it coming.\\"  Johnny Blaze (Cage) has been living in Europe alone trying to control his demon. When a strange church member (Elba) asks him for help Blaze isn't so sure he wants the job. After being told he can destroy the Ghost Rider inside him he decides to help find the boy. But as always things aren't so easy. Once again as many of you know I am not a Cage fan at all. I thought the first \\"Ghost Rider\\" was awful and one of the only reasons I thought this one might be OK is becuase the directors of the \\"Crank\\" movies directed this one. It was easy to tell that they did, they have a specific style that I enjoy. As for the rest of the movie I thought it was laughably bad. The effects were OK but Cage is so over-the-top in this that it almost feels like he's mocking himself. I know movies like this aren't watched for the acting, but when it's this bad it's too distracting to not notice. All that said it you liked the first one then you will probebly also like this one. I didn't like either but that's because I don't like Cage. This movie is just a little above \\"Drive Angry\\" in quality. Overall, if you want to know why I think Cage is one of the worst actors working then watch this movie. I give it a C.

0547569653|4.0|As someone who has just been introduced to the world of ultras, I found this book to be intriguing as to how Jurek came to be the man he is.  He revisits his childhood and explains, sometimes painfully, how he started running the distances that he did.  He also illustrates how he evolved from a carnivorous junk food eater to the clean vegan that he is today.  It was startling because, being someone who once thought they would never survive on a diet free of meat products, I started questioning the healthfulness of my current ways; especially when he explains what too much animal protein does to the system.  Its great too, that at the end of each chapter a vegan recipe accompanies it, so its almost easy to start eating healthier.<br /><br />This book is fantastic.  Having read and adored Born to Run, its interesting to see Jurek's account of his experience with the Raramuri.  Towards the end, the reader finds out that like everyone else, Scott is human too, and it ends on a rather depressing and solemn note, but nonetheless, it really reminds me of why I run.  If you are into the ultra scene, then you will undoubtedly appreciate the cameos that appear in this book as well.<br /><br />The only regret I have is that I read this book wayyy too fast.  I could NOT put the damn book down.  All in all though its a fantastic read and I encourage anyone remotely interested in ultras, Scott Jurek, healthy eating or all 3 to read this.

1566635535|1.0|The phrase \\"show, don't tell\\" is used so often in English and Creative writing courses that it should be familiar to most everyone who chances upon this review. Showing is more dynamic, and is more interesting to one's audience. Telling can be dull, leaving an audience bored or worse. If one has any difficulty understanding the differences between the two, they may do well by purchasing this play. It is, by far, the laziest and most insipid example of serious playwriting that I have ever experienced. Among other dramatic missteps, it is filled with the worst examples of telling rather than showing; an egregious and fatal error, especially in a play - the most basic of visual and auditory mediums.<br /><br /> This play, like all plays bearing this title, is an adaptation of Mary Shelley's original romantic novel from 1818. However, this one breaks new ground in that it doesn't adapt the novel for the stage, but lazily transposes the prose of the novel to the stage to be enacted as a heavily bowdlerized audio book. Though the intent of bringing the literary Frankenstein to the stage unfettered by dramatic embellishment and years of Hollywood Monster Mash stigma was a bold, it creates a significant quagmire in the effort of dramatic storytelling. The novel primarily consists of Frankenstein's autobiographical remembrances as told to Captain Walton - a style that is quite acceptable in a novel, especially one of its time, but when put on the stage, this same series of remembrances becomes an unending barrage of tedious monologues. Long passages of time are glossed over in sentences, and important character discoveries are described after the fact; instead of being shown these events, and experiencing their importance along with the characters, we are told of them and told how to feel about them, rendering audience involvement virtually impossible. Some efforts are made throughout the narrative to show action rather than telling of it (when Frankenstein is with his family they are often given some lines of interplay) but these are momentary distractions before the audience is again made to endure even more stale expository diatribes.<br /><br /> Forgiving the inherent laziness behind the intent of such an adaptation, transcribing a novel for the stage to preserve it's literary integrity might have been an interesting idea - but alas, it is riddled with befuddling changes in the plot that not only deviate from the intent of the novel, but also cripples the story. The original novel began and ended with the letters of Captain Walton, whose own pursuit of scientific fame mirrored Frankenstein's. This creates a character arch that fittingly bookends the macabre tail, with Walton learning from Frankenstein's mistakes and ending his dangerous and misguided arctic voyage. But the play removes this framing device, opting instead to open by having Mary Shelley describe the tale's genesis as gleaned from the novel's preface.  Having Shelley recite her story within a story may have worked if it was structured in a similar manner to the Walton arch, but this narrative element is dropped completely in the second act, and Mrs. Shelley never says another word. What's more, Walton is shoehorned into the play's final 10 minutes; an obvious attempt by the playwright to maintain the novel's moral catharsis, but this comes way too late in the game, and only results in a cluttered ending to a clumsy play. Other plot changes of this nature (Such as the removal of Safie as a character, thus eliminating her grammar lessons, thus leaving the creature without a reason to be as eloquent as he is) make this story not just an uninspired adaptation, but a frustrating and incompetent one too.<br /><br /> Considering its concept and grievous failures, the resulting play is a sadly useless adaptation. Any audience forced to sit through this, unless they are forgiving, die-hard fans of the literary Frankenstein, will be treated to the theatrical equivalent of Ambien, and anyone reading this play may as well read the novel, which has the clearer, more efficient, and more affecting story. The only reason to buy this turgid garbage is, as I said at the beginning, to see how not to write something.n, and anyone reading this play may as well read the novel, which has the clearer, more efficient, and more affecting story.

For the price you can't go wrong in my opinion.
030758836X|5.0|Having read and reviewed Gillian Flynn's \\"Sharp Objects\\", I was happy to receive this latest work from the author.  I like dark fiction, mystery, and the odd bit of creepiness, and this newest title definitely fits the bill.<br /><br />This novel is told in the first-person POV of Nick Dunne, interspersed with diary entries from Amy, his wife.<br /><br />Nick was a successful magazine writer and his wife Amy wrote quizzes for magazines in New York.  Life was good, especially because Amy also had a decent trust fund from her parents, two psychologists who are the writers of the \\"Amazing Amy\\" series of children's books, based loosely on their daughter's life.<br /><br />Shortly after Nick loses his job, closely followed by Amy losing hers, Nick receives a call from his twin sister Margo \\"Go\\".  Their well-loved mother is dying of cancer, and Nick decides, without consulting his wife beforehand, that they will move back to his hometown of North Cartage, Missouri to help Margo take care of her.  Nick and Margo had always talked about opening a bar, so they borrow from Amy to do so, while Amy ends up being the one sitting with their mother during her treatments, with nothing to do and no friends.<br /><br />On the morning of their fifth wedding anniversary, Nick receives a call from his neighbor.  His door is wide open and their cat is sitting on the porch.  Nick arrives to find a scene of disorder, with a heavy ottoman overturned and other signs of violent struggle throughout the house. Worst of all, his wife is missing.<br /><br />This is a story of the dark side of marriage and humanity.  Ms. Flynn is a talented writer, expert at drawing a mental picture that so perfectly chills the reader:  \\"There's something disturbing about recalling a warm memory and feeling utterly cold.\\"<br /><br />With most missing-person cases, close family are the immediate suspects, and Nick finds himself followed closely by the two detectives assigned to the case.  Following the clues left by his wife's anniversary \\"treasure hunt\\", we also suspect Nick, even while he voices his innocence.  Amy's diary entries only add to our suspicions, as we follow the trail of a marriage gone cold, filled with dark bursts and suspicions.<br /><br />When I wasn't reading this book, I was thinking about it. When I was reading it, it was difficult to put down.  I was drawn in from the first page, and totally transfixed thereafter.  This is a brilliant piece of psychological writing that will have lovers of dark fiction wishing there were more pages.<br /><br />This one will definitely be on my \\"Best Reads\\" of 2012 list.  Pick it up; you won't regret it.<br /><br />QUOTES<br /><br />I simply assumed that I would bundle up my New York wife with her New York interests, her New York pride, and remove her from her New York parents - leave the frantic,thrilling futureland of Manhattan behind - and transplant her to a little town on the river in Missouri, and all would be fine.<br />I did not yet understand how foolish, how optimistic, how, yes, just like Nick I was for thinking this.  The misery it would lead to.<br /><br />These messages and orders brought to you by my father, a mid-level phone-company manager who treated my mother at best like an incompetent employee.  At worst?  He never beat her, but his pur, inarticlate fury would fill the house for days, weeks, at a time, making the air humid, hard to breathe, my father stalking around with his lower jaw jutting out, giving him the look of a wounded, vengeful boxer, grinding his teeth so loud you could hear it across the room.  Throwing things near her but not exactly at her.  I'm sure he told himself:  I never hit her.  I'm sure because of this technicality he never saw himself as an abuser.  But he turned our family life into an endless road trip with bad directions and a rage-clenched driver, a vacation that never got a chance to be fun.  Don't make me turn this car around.  Please, really, turn it around.<br /><br />He came home from work and kissed me full on the lips, and he touched me as if I were really there.  I almost cried, I'd been so lonely.  To be kissed on the lips by your husband is the most decadent thing.<br /><br />In the videos, I wore clothes Amy had bought me, and I brushed my hair the way she liked, and I tried to read her mind.  My anger toward her was like heated wire.<br /><br />\\"...why are you so wonderful to me?\\"<br />He was supposed to say:  You deserve it. I love you.<br />But he said, \\"Because I feel sorry for you.\\"<br />\\"Why?\\"<br />\\"Because every morning you have to wake up and be you.\\"<br /><br />Writing:  5 out of 5 stars<br />Plot:  5 out of 5 stars<br />Characters:  5 out of 5 stars<br />Reading Immersion:  5 out 5 stars<br /><br />BOOK RATING:  5 out of 5 stars<br /><br />Sensitive Reader:  Some profanity<br /><br />Book Clubs:  Definitely a great pick - there will be lots to discuss as you move through the book and the direction of the story and the feel for the characters change.>He came home from work and kissed me full on the lips, and he touched me as if I were really there.

B0067AC5KA|4.0|It's taken me a few months decide how I should write a review of these books.  Here goes nothing...<br /><br />As for the positives:<br /><br />Loved, loved, loved the first two books.  Admittedly, it took a bit of pushing before I really got my footing in the first book; once about 15% in, I couldn't put it down.  The plot was all over the place, in a really good way.  I really didn't know which way things were coming.  Some things were predictible, some things totally blindsided me.  I loved the characters, even the ones I hated! It really mattered what happened. After I finished the first book, I couldn't start the second one fast enough.  And the same as book 1, I couldn't put book 2 down.  The books were different but both very good in their own respect.  So of course, upon completing book 2, I immediately began book 3.  Then wham!!  I hit a brick wall.  The few mild annoyances from books 1 and 2 that I overlooked because the plot was so engaging, became huge distractions in book 3 because the plot was... well, I don't know where it went.  All I was left with were distractions.<br /><br />So as for the negatives:<br /><br />As has already been stated about a gazillion times, Swedes must love their coffee and sandwiches.  A couple of the other reviews have even listed the number of times coffee and sandwiches were mentioned all total.  To discuss it in a review may seem petty -- but when I was unable to find the plot of book 3, I was left to consider all of the sandwiches and coffee.  And really, who eats a sandwich with coffee three times a day?  Was something lost in translation?  I mean, I like sandwiches.  I like coffee.  But together for every meal?  I'm not sure about that.  And if you found this little op ed about sandwiches and coffee to be a bit ridiculous and distracting from the rest of the review -- exactly my point.<br /><br />And the names.  Oh, the names.  By the third book, there were more characters mentioned than I could ever begin (or want) tokeep track of.  Complicating this matter further is that everyone's name is Swedish which 1) are unfamiliar names, thus difficult to remember, 2) many of the names sound very much alike, 3) many of the names are mentioned once then never brought up again.  Again, for a book without an interesting plot, the names became a distraction.<br /><br />The first and second books were great.  I couldn't wait for every opportunity to pick up my Kindle.  Very shortly into the third book, I knew there was a major problem.  The plot was uninteresting or maybe even non-existent.  It left me completely distracted with what were minor issues in the first and second books.  All told, in book 3, it was just too much work.  And it didn't take me long to realize I just really didn't care.  Too bad.<br /><br />Four stars because the first two books were really that good.  Just don't feel like you have to read book 3 for your life to be complete.  Skipping it is highly recommended.
0739341243|5.0|This book is extremely insightful and the author made a stellar effort to collect an all-encompassing view of introversion.  Much emphasis must be placed on the \\"power of introverts\\" aspect of the book as Cain goes to great lengths to reassure the (introverted) audience that the American bias against introversion, by encouraging extroversion in all aspects of life, is unnecessary and the irreplaceable benefits to society offered by introverts.  This is, by far, my most favorite book of all time.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|very enjoyable just don't like the pay for special items I like the ease of play wish there was more energy
0345803485|1.0|This book was painful to read, I have a theory though.... The hype surrounding this book is MOSTLY women who have never really read erotica before. It has to be the \\"new shiny toy\\" aspect of the genre.... and sadly this is the new toy :( I found it bland & repetitive. The characters were dull and the actual bdsm was laughable and a bit on the tacky side, to say the least. The storyline itself was lacking.<br /><br />  Most regular readers of erotica will tell you that there are so many BETTER erotic novels out there, and not to waste your time on this one. This is actually tied for first place on my \\"worst book I've ever read\\" list!

1439127700|5.0|Absorbing, detailed and factual - this interesting book describes how ex-presidents co-operate with one another and, for the good of the country, will neither offend nor criticize an incumbent.<br /><br />Although I chose to read the book on my Kindle Fire, I recommend a hardcover version to share with others.  Having lived thru decades of presidents, I knew quite a bit of the more recent acts of friendship and cooperation between Carter/Ford, Clinton/Bush, Eisenhower/Truman,  etc. but there were some surprises!  I especially enjoyed the chapter on Herbert Hoover and am sending for his biography - a great man whose gifts to the nation have gone largely unnoticed.<br /><br />If you enjoy reading about the American presidents and especially what they accomplish after their stint in the White House ends, then you may agree with me, this is one of the better books published on the subject - the author writes well and holds your attention. Since I am an independent voter, I appreciate reading about \\"both sides\\" and knowing that there are usually a few ex-presidents alive and ready to help an incumbent if asked, no matter which party reigns. Reading about this unique \\"Club\\" will make you proud to be an American.
B0083GPDBO|4.0|A very nice twist on the superhero theme, but its a love it or hate it type of movie.  Its starts of slow with some predictable Hollywood teenage themes, but later delves into theories of what happens when humans have absolute power, some of which can be related to the real world.  Not exactly a date night movie, but I enjoyed and was happy my lady was nice enough to watch with me.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|Great movie composed of an amazing story and good acting. Batman Begins is one of the best Batman movies up to its release and is followed by an equally enjoyable film, Dark Knight.
B00498TQV8|5.0|This movie without a doubt was absolutely the best movie I saw this year.  Great actors, story line, and cinema photography.  This movie is not for young children.  However, most adults will love the suspense and lead actress.  I highly recommend you rent this movie....

B000JIHP88|5.0|I am so glad I purchased this mobile when I was pregnant. Here we are 4 years later, and we still love it. Once she got old enough to start pulling on the mobile I took that part off and we only use the musical part. The music has become a ritual every night since she was born. If she doesn't fall asleep by the time it shuts off automatically, she asks me to turn it on one more time. She loves it and I say whatever works! There are 3 classical music selections and one selection that sounds like quiet jungle noises (monkey, frogs, crickets chirping). After 4 years of playing this every night at bedtime, changing times when she was a baby, and naptimes, I have only had to change the batteries twice. The batteries have lasted a lot longer now that I took off the mobile attachment which is as expected. This is at the top of my list of worthwhile things I purchased to prepare for my baby.

B006OB3K56|2.0|There must be a demand for movies like this, since they get made. There must be people who like movies like this, since they get good reviews and win (or at least get nominated for) awards. Maybe the good reviews convinced me to watch this movie, but it was a mistake.<br /><br />This movie is stupid and irritating. The story is stupid, and all the people in it are irritating, self-centered, self-pitying jerks. Who cares if such obnoxious people are unhappy? Besides, they're all straight. No wonder they're all screwed up: they're trying to have sex with the wrong sex. How could that make anybody happy?<br /><br />It's time to take a break from watching movies when I start watching dumb, irritating movies about heterosexual angst like this one.
B0086700CM|5.0|I play this game more than any other app I have installed on my kindle fire. Major kudos to the devs!
B0059WTMLW|3.0|Enough is enough! Apparently you are both old enough to have a phone .. both leaving cynical and worthless reviews on every app. May i suggest consulting a trained psychiatrist as it appears something was lacking in your youth.

B005LAIH2W|5.0|This is an excellent movie.  It depicts the tragic love between John Carter of Earth and Dejah Thoris of Mars.  True to the book it depicts the unique features of the various factions and races on Mars as they struggle to survive against fearsome foes.<br /><br />The director adds an extra twist by making the Thune a hostile but technologically advanced race.  I think this adds a nice twist to the story.  This is a really fun film with lots of great cinematics.<br /><br />The story is tried and true,  hero saves princess, but there are some nice twists that make it well worth watching.<br /><br />Of course the jaded critics only want to see depressing and demoralizing material to match their fallen nature and thus they panned this film. Even worse the films promotion was deliberately sabotaged by Disney who I guess didn't like  director's Stanton's work with break-away Pixar.<br /><br />I recommend however this movie wholeheartedly.
B0086700CM|4.0|I love this game! but it took so long to get on a kindle fire. Awesome but I have to give it a 4. after awhile it gets kinda boring but other than that best adventure game.
B000001FTD|4.0|Let's be honest.  I was not an Anthrax fan in the 80's.  I was a huge Metallica and Megadeth fan (still am), but was not into Anthrax (or Slayer - am now!).  Anyway, it wasn't until The Sound of White Noise with John Bush on vocals that I became a fan.  Even then, Anthrax sort of ebbed and flowed and it wasn't until Worship Music that I really got back on board big time.  That album also caused me to look more deeply into the old Joey Belladonna days.  This is obviously the cornerstone of the early Belladonna era, so I started here.  To make a long story short, while it took me a while to get used to, it was worth the time.  This is an outstanding album and got me into the entire Anthrax back catalogue (minus the Neil Turbin one which I have never listened to).  Anthrax is now one of my favorite bands, regardless of whether it's Bush or Belladonna singing.  I highly recommend this album to any fan of Anthrax or thrash metal in general.

B0059WTMLW|5.0|This is a great app! There are different variations so you don't have to just play traditional sudoku. It also has lots of difficulty levels for each variation. I really like the fact that I can personalize so many different aspects of the game, from highlighting in different colors to what types of helps/checks it does. There is a place to turn off the &quot;spyware&quot; in settings as well, so no need to freak out about that either. Definitely the best sudoku app I've seen! Great for the FAOTD!!! But if you missed out it is worth the money! :)

B003J27WFW|5.0|Like many who have reviewed this, I like Rush but am not a fanatic, only own a few of their albums and have never seen them in concert; yet I loved this film.  It's everything a doc should be, particularly a music doc.  The clips of their peer musicians discussing why the band matters to them are great, especially Billy Corgan of Smashing Pumpkins who has some very insightful things to say.  Funny, informative, has never before seen footage.  Really really wonderful film that I will watch again and again.

0312427999|5.0|I cannot give a review that would do this book justice. It is well researched, well documented, and well written. It should turn any intelligent, open minded person against laissez-faire capitalism. Only a Rush Limbaugh idiot would give this book a one star rating. It makes me wonder how such closed and vacant minds bothered to read it.
B0089ZEEYG|5.0|such a cute game. I love the challenge to it and its totally addicting. definitly give this one a download!
B007WFR1TE|5.0|Let me start by saying as great an album as Mechanize is & how it's a HUGE improvement and then some over Transgression, I still felt it was lacking that classic Fear Factory sound & feel we came to know & love back in the 90's. Fast forward to June 5th 2012 and we get this masterpiece known as The Industrialist, which took me right back to the Demanufacture/Obsolete era! The Industrialist is an album that would have fit perfectly in between Demanufacture & Obsolete. So far I only own the standard edition of the album & plan on buying the Digibook Edition soon aswell, The Industrialist is that damn good! The standard edition contains 10 tracks total,tracks 1-8 are actual songs (each one \\"bang your head!\\" material), track 9 (Religion Is Flawed Because Man Is Flawed) is a short instrumental & track 10 (Human Augmentation) is a 9 minute long ambient track with a trippy distorted voice speaking throughtout (can't quite make out most of the words). Now I have read some reviews from others complaining how there are only 8 actual songs & saying Tracks 9 & 10 are just filler, I personally disagree. Religion is Flawed also serves as a perfect outro for Disassemble and an intro for Human Augmentation which, in my opinion, is the perfect way to end this awesome album after banging your head & getting your face melted for a good 38 minutes and ties in perfectly with the story & theme of The Industrialist. Here is my own personal list of Fear Factory albums (just the 8 studio albums) from \\"best\\" to \\"not as good\\" IMO:<br /><br />1)Demanufacture<br />2)The Industrialist<br />3)Obsolete<br />4)Soul Of A New Machine<br />5)Archetype<br />6)Mechanize<br />7)Digimortal<br />8)Transgression<br /><br />So, what are you waiting for? Go grab yourself a copy (or two) of The Industrialist right now!\m/<br /><br />P.S. I would also like to point out that I myself loved The Industrialist from the very first listen & with each listen it keeps getting better & better! So, for those of you who thought it was average or a little below at first, give it a few more listens, it will most likely grow on you. The Industrialist is a concept album, so understanding the story behind it makes it that much better!

I laughed as John Carter arrived through a worm hole in the 1870's or early 1880's and found himself in about 1/5 G Mars.  He bounced around and fell down, lost his balance and had to learn to walk all over again.  Then he stumbles upon the natives -- kind of Mar's version of Earth's native peoples.  They come with their adorable, but at first quite scary version of a bulldog and hippo.  It moves like lightning.  He soon amazes the natives with his prodigious jumping ability and becomes a clan member.  Well, the story keeps on moving from adventure to adventure and meetings with the ancient, earth like aliens.  Aha... they seem friendly... and I'll leave you at that.  This movie was full of evolving plot and remarkably lacking in bloody violence.  It was as big a positive surprise as I have ever seen and perhaps one of my favorite five movies of all time.  As a long-time science fiction fan and amateur astonomer, I can tell you it is destined to be a classic.  I hope there are follow-ups too. The plot line leaves lots of questions open and possibilities for youngish John Carter and his career, rule, and progeny.  One last little surprise.  The Martian version of a dog has a long way to go too.  Every really good film needs a surprising and wonderful animal like that to steal the show a little at times and add some humorous relief.  That's what I really loved about this film so much.  It didn't take itself so seriously that it ended up as a massive failure like the movie Dune.  Star Wars too had this same type of sense of adventure and comic relief at times.  If you loved Star Wars, you'll love this too.
0060558121|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book! I am a huge fan of Neil Gaiman and whenever someone is looking for something read, I recommend his books, either this one, our if they are open to it, his Sandman series. Amazing author and book
B003NWS5AO|5.0|One thing you've got to respect about Robert Plant is that he neither backtracks nor repeats himself.  The title \\"Band Of Joy\\" comes down from the musical group Plant played with before joining \\"The New Yardbirds\\" (which quickly became Led Zep), yet this isn't Plant pretending that it's 1968 all over again.<br /><br />Yet so many of these songs are decades old; Plant, along with guitarist Buddy Miller (who worked with Plant and Alison Kraus on the \\"Raising Sand\\" project) seek to find new arrangments and interpretations for these songs.  Plant has obviously learned a lot about production from T-Bone Burnett; Burnett gives much of \\"Raising Sand\\" a skeletal musical style, and whilst this album can't be said to mimic that, one can say with great certainty that there's not one unncessary riff, lick or note on \\"Band Of Joy\\".<br /><br />Still, I hesitate to use the word \\"minimalist\\" to describe the sound of this record, because this particular collection of songs just has such a FULL sound to it.  Plant knows what to over-do and what to under-do; knowing \\"when to do what\\" makes doing both unnoticeable; all one hears is one heck of a good-sounding record.  You don't notice the \\"why\\" or the \\"how\\", you only hear the end result, which is greatness.<br /><br />Plant only pens one track here, \\"Central Two O' Nine\\", writing with Buddy Miller.  This song fits the record perfectly, but one should note that all of these songs now sound like Plant songs; he's made quite a mark upon them.  Plant's attention to detail, evident in his approach not to just to each song, nor to each line within each song, but rather to every word of every line, is remarkable.  He's obviously put great thought into how to first inhabit these songs, and then communicate their deepest meanings to the listener.  So much of what is expressed in this music is ineffable, but through melody and phrasing, Plant makes the meaning clear.<br /><br />Others deserve kudos as well; Buddy Miller is both excellent guitarist and producer; a good chunk of the credit for this album's quality must decidedly go to him.  Adding a feminine touch is singer Patty Griffin; she provides a wonderful vocal compliment to Plant's singing.  She is cast in a supportive role, and yet her contribution to this record is quite distinct.  With Griffin present, you get Plant's interpretation of these songs, but you get Griffin's as well; it's like listening to two people telling you the same story simoultaneously.  Overall they agree, but their perspectives are unique, and the combination gives each song not just one soul, but two.<br /><br />The rhythm section is phenomenal, featuring Byron House (bass) and Marco Giovino (drums); they're a force to be reckoned with in their own right.  Multi-instrumentalist Darrell Scott adds great color and texture to each song, rounding out the album's sound.<br /><br />Plant has proven, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that he's a great artist in his own right; he needn't depend upon the past glories of Led Zep.  He is just as relevant today as he ever was; he is a solo artist who puts together great bands.  These musicians he's gathered together for \\"Band Of Joy\\" play like a band that's toured together for decades.  Yet in the midst of this \\"Band Of Joy\\" that's larger than the sum of its parts is Plant; not just technically a great singer, but an artist who can communicate what is wordless in the depths of the heart.<br /><br />I recommend this brilliant album wholeheartedly.  Enjoy it.

B0028YPDVW|5.0|My aunt has run a daycare service for several years, and still is. Among other toys, she has had baskets of Schleich toys for years. I'm not just talking about this wolf, she had a LOT of them. The toys were sturdy and held up really well, shoot, after 15+ years, she still has them and they're still in great shape. If they can stand several years as daycare toys with no problems, then they can handle even the roughest playtime from the roughest children. The toys are accurate so they have good educational value. Whenever I visited her I would play with the animal toys and they were super fun. They may cost a bit more than other animal figures, but the quality is very good and considering the durability, you'll never have to worry about replacing them unless you lose them.

B005LAIH2W|1.0|I read the John Carter on Mars books many years ago while I was in college. A few months ago I came close to paying $19 a ticket for my wife and I  to see it opening weekend but at the last moment I decided to consider the very poor newspaper reviews of the movie and wait for it to come out on DVD. I almost bought the DVD.... thankfully at the last moment I saved my hard-earned cash and watched it on pay per view.  There is really nothing to recommend this movie. The plot is pathetic and introduces some immortals who are manipulating the course of history on Barsoom. I don't recall this element in any of the books and they serve no purpose- other than to annoy and disrupt the flow of the already poor story- here except to provide the technological means for John Carter to find himself on Mars. I prefer the version in the books- I believe it was through a dream, or something like that- in a fantasy movie not everything has to have an explanation.<br /><br />  Special effects naturally dominate this movie but here again the movie fails. The \\"airships\\" did not capture the feel of the airships in the books and they didn't even remotely look real. The Tharks were o.k. The fixed sets looked horrible- the cities etc. Never do we feel we are anyplace but Arizona or New Mexico.<br /> The acting was horrible as was the dialogue.<br /><br />In sum: save your money and your free time. Don't waste either on this movie.
B005HJWWW8|3.0|There's nothing quite like it... other than the E5 which is actually better. The E6 has a touch more distortion but better features. The plastic shell is strong enough, so no worries there. I think you've probably read enough about the functionality of the device. It's good. I like the intermediate bass boost. It's god a great balance to it.<br /><br />Anyway, these can drive some of the harder headphones a little, but anything that needs a good amp probably needs a better one than this.

B006Y9BULE|5.0|REVIEW UPDATE:<br /><br />I'm keeping my review of the watch at 5 stars simply because I enjoy the watch a lot and the watch itself is exceptionally attractive.  The factory bracelet though, at 10 days or so, continues to show that it is the weakness of the watch.  I work at a desk all day and the bracelet (which begins as glossy on the main surfaces) scratches far more easily than one would hope.  Much of the underside and 1/2 to 3/4 of the way up both sides are now scratched to some degree - heavily on the underside.  If the look of the factory bracelet (or the cost of a replacement) is important, then take this into consideration.  Again, there is justification for taking the review to 4 stars, but this still isn't an expensive watch for what you are getting.  I've seen a couple of aftermarket bracelets on this watch that will upgrade the looks significantly.  Even with that investment, I'll still be below 300 for an outstanding watch.  Now if the watch itself proves to be less than durable, I'll be back to adjust my rating down, but for now, it is hanging on to the 5 star.<br /><br />-------------------------<br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br /><br />I've had two prior Seiko's in my life - \\"way back\\" in the mid to late 80's.  Nice watches, but simply functional in nature.  Somewhere in the mid-90's I went through a cheap spell and would buy only the Ironman watches.  They kept time just fine but were non-inspiring for me.  No problem - again watches were functional, a necessary device.  Fast forward a few years to early 2010 when I bought a Citizen Nighthawk Eco-Drive.  I've worn that watch everyday since.  It's a great watch.  Unfortunately (for my bank account), it is also an inspiring watch.  It feels nice, looks nice, and being powered by light, is trouble-free.<br /><br />I've enjoyed the Citizen so much that I decided to start expanding my watch collection some - focusing only on light powered watches (I'm addicted to the always run and never have to replace the battery aspect of them).  My wish list is full of other Eco-Drive's that I'd like to have.  Only problem is almost all of them are out of my \\"willingness to spend\\" range.  So I've waited for several months.<br /><br />A few days ago I happened upon this watch.  \\"Seiko has a light-powered watch?\\"  Well, yes they do.  So, I surveyed the options and decided to order this model.<br /><br />Upon unwrapping, you'll find that Seiko has done an impeccable job of packing this watch.  It's clasp around a protective \\"pillow\\" and adequately protected.  It doesn't take long to realize this watch is an exceptionally attractive watch.  All of the dials are precise and the red accents provide a nice touch.  All-in-all, for me, an outstanding addition to my watches.<br /><br />The watch is large and has some heft, but honestly, it just feels \\"right\\".  Seiko just nailed it all the way around, as far as I'm concerned, on the watch.  So much so that I'm already considering one of the other variants.  I love my Citizen, but this watch is every bit it's equal - something I wasn't sure I was expecting.  Some may find it odd that the large \\"second\\" hand isn't really the second hand for the watch portion.  It's the second hand for the stopwatch portion.  The second hand is actually the smaller dial at the 9 o'clock position.  A little unconventional, but one which really makes sense.  Who really watches the second hand of a watch for any other reason than to count elapsed time (ok, so I'll give you New Year's Eve, but that's the only exception).  Since all other 364 (or 365 days for the leap years of course) days of the year the only time an average person uses the second hand to is count elapsed time, apparently Seiko decided to actually devote that hand to it's purpose by using it as the second hand for the stopwatch portion (as aforementioned).  Pretty logical.<br /><br />I'm be remiss if I didn't mention the bracelet.  I love it.  It looks great and is perfect for the watch.  Unfortunately, it seems to be more prone to scratches than one would hope for.  I work at a desk all day, so the underside of the bracelet comes in contact with the desk continuously.  After day one there were visible scratches - all on the underside where they are relatively unnoticeable, but they are still there.  However, as mentioned before, I am still considering other variants.  This is a minor nuisance - I wish it didn't happen, but you should expect some wear-and-tear on watches.  They take a beating.<br /><br />How could you solve the problem?  With a matte bracelet I guess.  But honestly, this watch deserves the shiny finish on the bracelet.  I think it complements the looks nicely and again, the scratches are on the underside and on the clasp.<br /><br />Lastly, the first time unscrewing the crown to set the time was fairly difficult.  It's on there quite good.  However, with some persistence, I finally got it loose and set the time.  Now it's securely screwed back down, but can be unscrewed with a more appropriate level of effort.<br /><br />Some may consider the knock on the bracelet worthy of a 4 star rating but the watch is stellar in so many ways, I just couldn't ding a whole star for that minor flaw.  How about a 4.8, rounded up to a 5?y, it seems to be more prone to scratches than one would hope for.

B000TGCR38|5.0|I've watched the whole move twice, and have found it to be so gut wrenching at the end. When good should have finally been recognizable and won, I couldn't believe how it fell apart. Of course it seems foolish now to have expected any other outcome. Some people will always sell out to the highest bidder, while others will do the right thing regardless of the personal danger they experience. I guess, too, the other reason I 'liked' it was because it really was a probable scenario during those times. The very end in Israel was kind of weird when the other woman from the war came to visit and almost gave the heroine's class room a dollhouse like quality. It was clear then, too, that she still loved her soldier and always would.

B0012GMXYM|5.0|I just listened to this album for the first time and found it to be an outstanding musical experience. Running just over 50 minutes, my interest was captivated from beginning to end; lush, beautiful keyboards throughout, great drums/percussion, beautiful singing & of course Carlos Santana's brilliant guitar solos giving the landscape some fire. Lyrically, this is the album of a seeker although the questions posed are offered in the form of conclusions drawn by one looking for answers from Life. Although I did not always agree with these assertions, never-the-less I certainly understand them as parts of the human experience here in this world. Musically speaking, the absolutely gorgeous sound here on this album is WOW!!! Not Rock music, not Jazz, not even Fusion...but a virtuostic amalgam of all three musical art forms that I would compare most closely with Chick Corea's \\"Return To Forever\\" band from the same time period(the early 70's)but make no mistake, this is a distinctly \\"Santana\\" album. I feel that this brilliant album defies a firm genre \\"label\\" and must simply say that it is brilliantly beautiful & I highly recommend it-I'm absolutely delighted that I chose to buy this album & give it a close listen. Enjoy & God bless :-)

B0079J28NW|5.0|The film itself is something that no other animated film provides.  It has unique imagery, a storyline that looks confusing, yet a simple one, and an excellent selection of Beatles music that fits the mood in selected scenes (it is a Beatles film after all!).  If you're a Beatles fan, you'll certainly get a kick from seeing.  Those that are not will enjoy the film's elements that it provides.  8.5 out of 10.<br /><br />The restoration of this film is one of the best restorations ever made.  Based upon a 4K restoration, unnecessary dirt has been removed and colors have been re-adjusted to match how it's supposed to represent. Grain has mostly been removed, but finding moments of DNR movement are slim, and does not affect everything else that the restoration provides.  4.5 out of 5<br /><br />As for the Audio... what a beast!  For a 1968 film, the 5.1 remix sounds like it was done today!  The entire sound field has been used throughout the film, with sound effects booming and spreading through different speakers, dialogue clean and consistent, and the music all taking advantage of the 5.1, with newly-remixed Beatles songs that are now better than ever.  Original Mono and Stereo soundtracks are provided, but both cannot be compared to the 5.1 remix.  5 out of 5.<br /><br />As for extras, it seems all of the bonus material from the previous MGM releases (except for a music-only track) have been provided.<br /><br />Fans of the Beatles or film collectors should certainly pick up this edition that is now a must-own.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|brilliantly done, considering the writers had to deal with preexisting material. prequels are hard to do; you already should know when going into this enterprise that you are watching a movie full of ghosts; seeing as there were no human bones or whatnot found in the first \\"Alien\\" movie. that being said, mr Scott handles a camera like michellangello handled a canvas. the shots were so beautifully done, i found myself wanting to visit the alien planet! the gothic atmosphere was well set-up: it requires a two year hypersleep just to reach the place, and the planet's atmosphere was toxic until you were in the Alien ship, which is one of the last places you wanted to be. so nowhere to run, and no help coming.<br /><br />you have a set of explorers, the year is 2089 or so, and they are able to convince the trillionare businessman mr weyland (so fans of the franchise should already know there's gonna be a doublecross) to fund an exploration to find the aliens that \\"created\\" human life on this planet. the basis for this exploration is cave drawings in multiple areas across the planet showing what appears to be the same life form being worshipped by the natives.<br /><br />(potential spoiler alert) as is the case with worship, eventually i believe the people stopped believing, and our \\"parents\\" decided to leave. with the desire to come back. and teach us respect for our elders in a big way. it turns out the creatures from the original movie were a weapon of mass destruction (this is well known to those who know the backstory of the original ), and the creators (called engineers in the film) were coming to wipe us ingrates out. (i personally think) the engineers created us as either slaves, and we rebelled; or as cattle for gladiator type games. or maybe they were just psychotic. either way, i now have a new movie to hungrily wait to come out on dvd to fill my sci-fi adventure appetite.
0439023513|4.0|SPOILER -- if you have not read the book yet, do not read this review.<br /><br />First of all, I am not writing this review to bash on the Hunger Games series. I absolutely loved the series and it has been one of the most enjoyable collection of books that I have read thus far. I recommend anyone to pick them up. However, after reading the first two books, I was super excited to read the third and was left a little upset with how it turned out.<br /><br />As a few other reviewers have mentioned, Peeta is what made the entire series, not Katniss. Along with a numerous amount of other Hunger Games readers who agree with me, Peeta is my favorite character. I literally had to read a few of the last pages before starting the book to make sure Peeta ends up living. If he died I would not have read it. (Okay, I probably still would have read it but I would have been extremely disappointed). I do not think that it is coincidental that Peeta gained the number one spot with many readers, as well as keeping the only warmth, and hope throughout the entire series. Without Peeta, Katniss was lonesome and stranded. There was no more Katniss Everdeen as we knew her without the existence of Peeta. It is during the Mockingjay that Katniss contemplates suicide and practically goes mad, mostly because Peeta is not with her. Also, when Peeta shows the effects from the TrackerJacker venom mind-torture, Katniss feels like she no longer has a purpose in life because her main goal before she died was to save Peeta's life. It was Peeta that kept the momentum going and whom the readers held faith in.<br /><br />Also, I would not necassarily call this certain detail a flaw, but more of a questionable quality about the book. I understand some people who have strong bonds with some of the main characters must die in a series like this. Cinna would be a good example. In a book full of tragedy, we, as readers, need to become attached to characters who form bonds with the main characters and then suffer the tragedy of their death along with Katniss and the others. However, Prim, I found to be a very questionable character to choose to die on Collins part. Prim was the main reason Katniss entered the Hunger Games, the reason why Katniss tried so hard to win, the reason why Katniss saved Peeta's life, and it is the entire reason why the rebellion occurred which consumed the two books to follow. Prim is the ultimate reason for all of the mess in Katniss's life. So why kill her off? It almost makes the entire story line pointless. Katniss spared her sisters life by volunteering for her in the Hunger Games just so she could see her be blown up a year or two later? It kind of defeats the purpose of what the books hold. Fighting for those you love.<br /><br />Another flaw in the book that I feel strongly about is the ending. Of course I wanted Katniss to end up with Peeta, even if he never regained his memory of his past with Katniss. However, the way Suzanne Collins made this happen just seemed to be unthinkable, even impossible when thinking of the situation in my own opinion. Katniss and Gale have been lifelong friends. Gale also loves Katniss for who she is, regardless if she would end up choosing to be with him instead of Peeta. Katniss says multiple times in all three books that Gale would not leave her, ever. So why does Collins end this amazing series with Gale living in a completely different district, miles and miles away from Katniss? I can understand her mother living away, maybe, but definitely not Gale. This just does not seem plausible; I feel that neither Katniss nor Gale would let this happen in real life.<br /><br />Also, as a reader, you want the ending of the final book to have some sort of resolution. But Katniss still has her nightmares; she is still morbidly depressed, and almost lifeless. What I personally got out of the ending was Katniss pretty much saying, \\"Well Gale is gone, but he is too much like me anyway. Too strong headed. I need someone really nice like Peeta. So I guess I will spend the rest of my life with him and spend years answering his questions of whether things are real or not real. The end.\\" This was obviously not the kind of ending I was looking for.<br /><br />Overall I felt that this book was 'okay' compared to the first two books. It is because of these first two books that back up the Mockingjay that I rate it with 4 stars instead of 3, the number it should actually be deserving of.meone really nice like Peeta.

1612130283|1.0|It's pretty hard to imagine how or why this book has gotten so much attention.  I have never understood the \\"romance novel\\" craze, but was somehow seduced by all of the media hype.  I'm on page 47 and will probably toss this book before going any further.  I understand that it ultimately gets pretty steamy, but I just can't get past the sophomoric writing style...it just isn't worth my time.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|Seriously when I first saw Drive I couldn't believe a movie this outside the box and out of touch with current trends could have been given a major release...and that's a helluva good thing!  One of the best examples of \\"show it, don't tell it\\" in a long time.  Bloody, thought provoking and ultimately heartbreakingly satisfying, Drive is not for you if you are looking for just a quick dumb badass driving fast movie.  Someone actually told me that they didn't like it because they, \\"thought it was going to be more like Transporter 3.\\"  This is NOT an action movie, it is a drama with some really cool action pieces in it...just as Taxi Driver is not an action movie but has some incredibly intense action moments in it.  Gosling is incredible as The Driver and is one of the best anti-heroes since Travis Bickle...and if you don't know who Travis Bickle is just go a head and rent Transporter 3 instead.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|\\"Beautiful Disaster\\" is a beautifully written and engaging story. I was captivated from the first pages. Great depth of leading and secondary characters! I couldn't stop reading this book, and at the same time I hated for it to end.

B005LAIHXQ|3.0|Call me old-fashioned but...<br /><br />Personally I would be quite perturbed if i could not conceive a human baby but a baby alien has no problem at all developing in my womb. Probably perturbed to the point of not being up for much acrobatic activity right after having a baby alien c-section. But, I'm a guy so what do i know.<br /><br />Kudos on making sure that android has head ripped off. Any proper sci-fi film is only worth its' salt if an android has head ripped off. Bigger kudos if the android can still talk after decapitation. Although, I was hoping the android would sing 'Daisy' whilst doing an android jig - so slight disappointment there.<br /><br />Very positive note: I did discover a great attraction for Meredith \\"lick her\\" Vickers. She's certainly the best excuse for spending a little extra and seeing movie in 3-D. She is going to be one of those starlets who looks even better ten years from now. Lovely. 3 stars
B0059WTMLW|5.0|EDIT:  Looks like OpenFient and Flurry have been removed from the game.  Kudos to the developer!<br /><br />Original review:<br /><br />This app is your basic Sudoku puzzle game, but it also has seven different variants, such as Color Sudoku, in which each each color must have a unique number in addition to the usual rules, and Jigsaw Sudoku, which has oddly-shaped squares.<br /><br />This game has one of the largest Settings menus I have seen in a long time.  Just about everything is customizable, from the level of help it gives you to the colors and fonts the app uses.<br /><br />The list of features in this game is enormous.  It has a full help system which can analyze the puzzle difficulty, tell you want techniques are needed to solve it, check for mistakes, fill in the pencil marks, or show your next move.  You can save multiple games in progress, and you can bookmark a particular layout so you can try a possible solution, then undo it all if you made a mistake, useful on harder puzzles where there may be several paths to follow.<br /><br />While this app does have OpenFeint, it asks when you start the app for the first time if you want to enable or disable it; it can also be disabled in the Settings menu.  The app also has Flurry Analytics, which can be disabled in Settings.<br /><br />My sole complaint about the app is there is no explanation for the different game variations, but fortunately they are pretty easy to figure out.<br /><br />The app works perfectly on my Motorola Xoom tablet and my HTC Evo 3D phone.
0345803507|5.0|it was best books  i ever read, but one of the book 50 shades of gray the pages fell apart in the middle before i even stared to read it, i very disappointed with that but i was not paying again to send it back so i am stuck with a damage book.

0345803485|2.0|This is one heck of a book. Not sure how I feel about it. Read it for my book club.
B006GSRFOY|5.0|I bought this a few weeks ago for the bonus disc but i was pleasantly suprised by the sound quality on Nightlife. This is the BEST sounding version yet and i have them all. Why can't they make all Thin Lizzy releases sound this way?? I just got Fighting in the mail today and haven't opened it yet but i hope it got the same treatment this one did.
B0086700CM|5.0|Fairly entertaining and extremely addictive. Good game for when you are bored or on a long trip. I would recommend this.
B0059WTMLW|4.0|for those familiar with the andoku app this is basically the same thing with  2 additional game versions. however the difficulty levels are NOT the same as the rest of the world. it starts out with &quot;very easy&quot; but that seems to be what most people would consider as &quot;moderate&quot;.  almost every block had 2-5 different penciled in numbers. usually they very easy and easy levels don't need any penciled numbers. so if you are new to the game this might not be the best app to start with.
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|This game is very fun to play.It is not too challenging but still a little diffucult.For 99&cent; you cant go wrong.This game also has a lot of content.
B00881VLCE|5.0|PUZZLE PIECES NO LONGER STICK. until this this morning I was having the same problem as others with not being able to pick up some pieces without some difficulty.  they must have come up with a fix because I haven't had trouble with a single stuck piece at all today. you guys just earned 5 stars. thanks for a fun free  jigsaw app with plenty of free puzzle packs to choose from.
B0063GORYU|4.0|its good. nice graphics easy to use. exactly what it says it is. bug keeps bugging you yo rate it and you need 20 words.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|this app was good at first. after my 3-4 tome using it, the app froze. WHEN this happens to you hold the power button on your kindle fire ( or any other android  device) for about 20 seconds then press again once the screen goes black. good luck with this piece of crap weather app. sometimes it wasn't even updated for multiple hours.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|What could go wrong at a funeral?  Everything.  This is just too too funny.  There are some great twist and turns that I could not have imagined.  Just great.  Great ending.
B005HSL626|3.0|in this app all you are doing is slicing fruit and it is good to do this app to do on a rainy day but not on your free time and also it gets boring when you are just slicing fruit.
B0086700CM|5.0|im really hype because temple run is finally a game on the kindle. I was tired of hearing that it was only androids<br />:)
B006KX3GXO|5.0|this app is so much fun were you can have pic and mess with it any way you want dogs animals and more pica to play around with. so when it a boring day. or it is raining I would get this app if I were you :) ;)
B002G1YPH0|5.0|My new CPU came with a burned out fan motor, so i decided i would try this instead of getting another stock unit. At the time my fan motor was DOA i was pretty frustrated, but now that i got this thing on the unit im actually very glad the orginal went out. This unit is SOOOOO much quieter then the stock fan, and it has twice the size fan on it. There are alot of people wondering if its going to fit in their cases. I can tell you i have a Corsair 500R with a sabertooth Z77 MOBO and all for Dimm slots filled and it fits better then the stock heat sink, and this board has thermal armor on it. Previous reviewers said that it was touching up against ram, they must have been using this thing in a stock case, because i did not get the largest of cases and i found it works great. A little advice though, this does require a plate on the back of the MOBO, if you have a case already and the manufacture did not already place an open panel in the back you will need to pull the MOBO, but i trust the seating on this unit more then i ever did the push clips, so the extra time it takes is definitley worth the effort. My board stated above does have the cut outs and it was as simple as removing the side panel. As for new computer builders, do yourself a favor and get a case that has the cutout, you will not regret it. overall great by worth every penny !
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Can't wait for the next CD.  This is an outstanding first effort.  Just call me Little Lion Man.  This is pure bluegrass magic.

B0086700CM|5.0|lol I used to make fun of people who play this but I cant seem to put it down. Its addictive and fun totally a good game!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|If you dont read romance....dont buy it. I find the first two books funny,sad,dirty,intriging,sexy,sweet and very entertaining. In my opinion,this is not your average romance novel, it's far more than that! It actually has a story, action, back ground, a very complex man,and a woman who is funny, and quite unsubmissive unless she wants to be...good for her. If you dont have a kinky side, and have no inner goddess...dont buy it!
B0059WTMLW|4.0|I love the difficulty options. I am horrible at Sudoku, but can learn with this on the easiest setting (hopefully). I never fully understood exactly how to play Sudoku, but over time I hope I can master it.<br />I deducted one star because the UI could be a little more spiffy and not so &quot;Windows 95&quot; looking.<br />Great game, though.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|I truly don't know what flick the dissers above saw but I thought this was one very good movie. \\"Alien\\" was a single dimension movie - scary, unique, and a great take-off on \\"And Then There Were None\\" done in space.<br /><br />This is a multi-dimensional film that had me asking during the screening, \\"What precisely does that mean?\\" and \\"How does that tie in with what we saw before?\\". Some of those questions were answered, some not.<br /><br />I guess if there are any open issues or mysteries remaining in a film some people feel let down and pan the movie. I don't need every answer handed to me in order to enjoy a really entertaining film. And the ending does mesh almost perfectly with the beginning of \\"Alien\\".<br /><br />Mission accomplished, Mr. Scott!
B002G9N0LY|5.0|FOREWARNED IS FOREARMED DEPT.<br />This is NOT a DVD. It's a 12\\" Laserdisc. These record album-sized predecessors of today's DVDs were visually superior. Until the advent of BluRay technology, Laserdiscs were the best home video format available.<br /><br />Seven decades later, Walt Disney's FANTASIA (1940) remains the ultimate hand-animated motion picture, an astounding blend of cartoon and classical music. Highlight is a segment that illustrates the first few billion years of Earth's evolution, right up until dinosaurs are killed off by global warming.<br /><br />Leopold Stokowski is shown in the dimmest of light while the Philadelphia Orchestra is primarily in silhouette against a rich blue screen. Halfway through the program, musicians improv some jazz, then they and narrator Deems Taylor demonstrate (with the help of an animated vertical line) what film audiotrack looks like and how its squiggling form constantly varies.<br /><br />The only limitation of this classic movie is a primitive two-channel soundtrack (it's NOT true stereo) that either plays separate but simultaneously with a phantom hole in dead center, or bounces ping pong fashion between extreme right and left. Regardless, this one's a monumental achievement of pure art. Highest recommendation!<br /><br />PROGRAM--<br /><br />\\"Toccata and Fugue in D Minor, BMV 565\\" - J.S.

B0031OCY2E|5.0|This is one incredibly bizarre story! It's also quite funny, I laughed out loud quite a few times. At the end, it's also quite troubling.<br /><br />I remember following this story in the Wall Street Journal. I now realize I only knew half the story. I recall being outraged at Mr. Whitacre's treatment by the Justice Department for acting as their spy for three years and then being indicted as his \\"reward\\" for all his hard work in bringing down, single-handedly, a worldwide criminal enterprise. I now know there's so many twists and turns in this story you could easily write the proverbial book!<br /><br />The end is ironic because it brings up a lot of important issues I can't discuss without spoiling the movie. It really catches you off guard on so many different levels! I even now have an insight into an old childhood friend, I haven't seen in many years, who behaved in a similar fashion to Mr. Whitacre.<br /><br />I think it's important to keep in mind that the real story is ADM (Archer Daniels Midland) an incredibly powerful transnational corporation that cost the world's consumers billions of dollars. We also get to see at the very end of The Informant what happened to all the key players. It's very troubling, indeed. The Supreme Court ruled in the 19th century that corporations have many of the rights of a living, breathing person. Too bad they don't get punished to the same degree a real person does!<br /><br />See: [[ASIN:0871566087 Corporate Crime and Violence: Big Business Power and the Abuse of the Public Trust]] and [[ASIN:B0001NXLIE Corporate Crime Update]] and [[ASIN:1567511589 Corporate Predators: The Hunt for Mega-Profits and the Attack on Democracy]]

B002QW7ALM|3.0|I'm started to get a bit concerned for lovers of Sci-Fi: Is extreme and gruesome violence the only way for Hollywood to tell a decent story? First District 9, then Gamers, now Pandorum. I'm really tired of having to close my eyes through a good portion of each Sci-Fi film I watch. Three Sci-Fi movies in a row is the beginning of a trend, and an annoying one at that!<br /><br />On the plus side: The will to survive is palpable in Pandorum. As is the drive to never give-up, absolutely, no matter, what! Despite every conceivable obstacle, our hero's fight to the bitter end to accomplish the impossible. On one level this story is about finding allies and displaying the ultimate courage a human being is capable expressing. The only reason why Pandorum gets 3 stars instead of zero! If you're timing to close your eyes is as good as mine, you might even leave the theater thanking whatever deity you worship for being reminded of the existence of people in the real world who are like the heroes in Pandorum!<br /><br />See: [[ASIN:0312205171 Courage: The Joy of Living Dangerously]] and [[ASIN:006084969X Integrity: The Courage to Meet the Demands of Reality]] and [[ASIN:1590308859 Smile at Fear: Awakening the True Heart of Bravery]]
B000003TA4|1.0|I was introduced to this \\"band\\" when \\"Nevermind\\" came out.  I was in junior high.  At my locker one morning, a friend of mine came dashing up to me and said \\"You've got to check out this new band!  They're called Nirvana, and they're amazing!\\"  I took a listen, and scoffed.  Complete garbage.<br /><br />Recently, I came across an old copy of the CD in a music store, for about $3.  Trying to change my opinions about certain genres of music, I decided to give it one more spin.  Boy...was that a mistake!  First, Cobain can neither play guitar OR sing.  What few melodies (however piecemeal) he DOES manage to create are decimated by his horrible voice and the remains are buried beneath layer upon layer of sludgy distortion and feedback.  Beyond that, Grohl's drumming is heavy-handed and lethargic, probably to go along with the god-awful \\"guitar playing\\" up front.  The bass is nearly inaudible, and the whole recording is slathered with a slick, overwrought production that does nothing but help me maintain my original idea that grunge in general (and Nirvana/\\"Nevermind\\" in particular) is/was hopeless, tuneless B.S.  Worth noting is the fact that Grohl's next band, Foo Fighters, were a virtual carbon-copy of this turd-polishing exercise, yet several shades more entertaining (probably because Grohl isn't as boring, wimpy or mealy-mouthed).<br /><br />Can't help but note that there is a reason the disc was three bucks.  For all I know, it's still with my ex.  Have fun, honey.
B002NXSRVG|5.0|There's only one scene of gruesome violence. The actors have decent chemistry. The sets are imaginative. The story is entertaining enough. I would even call GI Joe more science fiction then anything else. This is a fun B-movie, something safe enough for even older children to enjoy.<br /><br />Sure, GI Joe gets most of it's ideas from much better movies like the Matrix, X-Men and the Manchurian Candidate. So I realize it would be easy to tear a film like GI Joe to pieces! But the story made me laugh, at times, for being so preposterous. And, it was entertaining without going overboard. What's more New York City gets a reprieve, for a change, and was not attacked by the terrorists! What more could you ask for from this kind of movie?
B0059WTMLW|5.0|UPDATE:<br /><br />Well, it turns out since I wrote the original review last June that they have taken out all of the analytics and the potential spyware. I'm happy for that. Now, I can review the actual game. It's actually a very good rendition of sodoku and If you are into this kind of game you will enjoy it. I would recommend it on a tablet or a larger screen phone however. It can get a bit tough to handle otherwise.<br /><br />Let this all stand as proof that those of us who speak up when an app is doing something wrong or when we call out developers for acting strangely that we can get results. Now you can hopefully see why we do it-- we do it because it does sometimes work.<br /><br />Also, I don't have a problem with analytics as long as they are opt-in and we are told about them upfront. It should be USER choice because, in my case, sometimes I don't care about them on a particular device/app and sometimes I do. Openness is always the best policy in these matters.<br /><br />Now then, for posterity...<br /><br />The original review:<br /><br />Title: HOW DARE YOU! (1 star)<br /><br />Text: While I completely understand the incessant need to invade our privacy for free apps (I do not agree with it but I understand it), this is supposed to be a paid app! Thus, how DARE you hide tracking software inside of it and not tell us? who the heck do you think you are? I will never support your company by buying any app you make ever and I will tell everyone I know to avoid you. you people are snakes!
B002SJIO5E|1.0|I'm starting to truly believe that a large segment of the human race (mostly male) has a defective gene. This defective gene causes a love of gruesome violence and a total lack of concern for the suffering of others. This gene also promotes binary thinking - the guy with the white hat is good and the guy with the black hat is bad. There's no in-between. And if there is - who cares!<br /><br />A certain segment of Hollywood knows how to precisely exploit this genetic weakness and billions of dollars pour into their bank accounts. Telling a good story is a lost cause for this segment of the population. Show as much blood, guts, torture and torment as possible. It's such a formula recipe, it could be written on the back of a matchbook cover: Blood, guts, action = BILLIONS, year in, and year out! Why didn't I think of that?<br /><br />If you love oceans of blood, vomiting, heads and limbs popping off of bodies with regularity, a graphic torture chamber used for medical experiments and repeated attempts at cutting off someone's arm - then District 9 is for you! And there is also ZERO sexuality in this film. (Why am I not surprised?)<br /><br />The only reason I didn't walk out was because I wanted to see if the good guys were going to win in the end. I did actually care about the main characters and the gruesome violence made watching District 9 all that much sadder and annoying to watch.<br /><br />THIS NOT A FILM FOR CHILDREN!! If the images shown do not disturb your children, I suggest they need to get some help. THIS IS A WAR PORN MOVIE! It exploits the audience, plain and simple!<br /><br />Beside feeling sad, I felt empty when I left the theater. Lucky for me I was able to sneak into another movie and watch it for free. It showed only a single act of serious (and accidental) violence and that story was an absolute delight! Too bad Hollywood doesn't make more great movies that actually entertain instead of making films that are so depressing and annoying!<br /><br />See:[[ASIN:1475075049 Save Me the Aisle Seat: The Good, the Bad and the Really Bad Movies: Selected Reviews by an Online Film Reviewer]] and [[ASIN:1456312812 What's A Nice Actor Like You Doing In A Movie Like This?: The ultimate guide to the most embarrassing movies in history, and the celebrities who appeared in them.]] and [[ASIN:1446522814 War, Sadism and Pacifism - Further Essays on Group Psychology and War]]and [[ASIN:076791547X Medical Apartheid: The Dark History of Medical Experimentation on Black Americans from Colonial Times to the Present]]>See:[[ASIN:1475075049 Save Me the Aisle Seat: The Good, the Bad and the Really Bad Movies: Selected Reviews by an Online Film Reviewer]] and [[ASIN:1456312812 What's A Nice Actor Like You Doing In A Movie Like This?: The ultimate guide to the most embarrassing movies in history, and the celebrities who appeared in them.]] and [[ASIN:1446522814 War, Sadism and Pacifism - Further Essays on Group Psychology and War]]and [[ASIN:076791547X Medical Apartheid: The Dark History of Medical Experimentation on Black Americans from Colonial Times to the Present]]

0515141429|3.0|The first half of this book reads like a bestseller...gripping, fresh and very real.  But then the author just loses it.  The book starts out like a movie starring Harrison Ford, but ends up alot more like a Steven Seagal flick.  The plot starts to develop holes, and the author tries to salvage the story through escalating violence. For instance, a high-ranking federal agent goes missing.  He turns up murdered in a small town during a major case, but not a single fed shows up to investigate. Not even someone secretly undercover.  Sorry, that just wouldn't happen, not in a million years.  Our hero Jack Reacher, an ex-GI living as a vagrant, must solve the case and bring justice for the victims.  He does that by killing everyone in sight. It's like the book was written in two halves, by two different people.  But it's still a good read, just for the first half.  Then just assume every one is corrupt and they all get killed, and save yourself some time.<br />Here is a peek at the fist half:  An innocent man just passing through town is picked up as a murder suspect.  The police interrogate him and believe he is probably innocent- especially since he has an alibi.  Then they arrest a second man for the crime, a man who confesses to the murder. But he also has an alibi.  So what made him confess?  A corrupt chief sends both men to prison over the weekend.  Jack's problems are only beginning.

0375751513|4.0|I picked up a an audio cd of 'The Picture of Dorian Gray' at the same time I was reading 'A Stranger's Child' by Alan Hollinghurst.  Interestingly the respective narratives move through Edwardian England while peeling back the layers of sexual repression and eroticism associated with the era. The author Diana Galbaldon accomplishes this successfully, too, with attendant similar homo-erotic themes in her Lord John (Grey)series.<br /><br />While both listening and reading similar books simultaneously I was trying to keep the characters aligned with each story. In fact, several characters from each book have the same name.  'Dorian Gray' begins with a prologue by the author that addresses in advance the freedom to publish content that Wilde surely felt would be controversial.  This proved to be prescient.<br /><br />The main character for whom the book is named in effect sacrifices his soul for the vanity of youth and life's experiences and excess. Up to a point, one could make a contemporary parallel to a life lived by a celebrity (i.e. Mick Jagger, Lindsay Lohan, etc.) at least from a public perception perspective.  The song 'You're so Vain' by Carly Simon could easily have been written as homage to the Dorian Gray character.<br /><br />There exists in the story line a protagonist (the painter of the picture) and antagonist - a friend of the painter's who, arguably is a devil incarnate, guides by suggestion Dorian Gray down a path of self-gratification, vanity and excess.<br /><br />For those of us that recall the Twilight Zone TV series from the 1960's, this book - a classic for it's time - would have made a marvelous episode.
B006GHA9VQ|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised that this turned out to be much more entertaining than I expected.  Coney Island 1903 - what a great setting.  Nothing on earth could ever compare to Phantom, but this stands on it's own. The characters seem realistic considering the time-lapse.  The set design and costumes are so dazzling - I'd be surprised if they didn't get complaints from the Orchestra. It enveloped me into it's world.  The music was passionately melodic with wonderful lyrics containing universal ideas on love and life.  So much like Phantom, but with a different kind of darkness.  So much regret and longing.  I was enthralled with all my essense viewing this on Blu-ray.  The  first few songs were gorgeous and hooked me right in.  I kept waiting for it to fail and just when I thought it would, it soared!  The only thing that upsets me is that I wasn't aware of this great production to have seen it in the theatre.  I can't wait to familiarize myself with the songs.  I know over time I will grow to love it more.  Sir Andrew Loyd Webber made NO MISTAKE in taking such a risk.  It works and hopefully at some point pays off. I couldn't help but imagine Baz Lurhman reconstructing this project into a movie.  It has so many qualities I imagine he could build on.  Bravo Sir ALW and your superb cast!!!

It promised answers and only offered questions. It implied tention and supplied boardom. The charactors were boring and pointless. I witnessed brillient scientist exibit nothing, but a lack of commen sense and go hysterical for nothing. Yelling and screaming without cause. The Engineers were nothing more than insane solders and scientist who were about developing biological weaponry which \\"WE\\" may have been created for as weapons, targets, ginny pigs or accidental biproducted or genetically flawed offspring created for an unknown reason or by accident of they're demise. Why did David infect Charlie just to screw us out of the results? I don't know. This movie made no sense. It did not coincide with the mythology nor did the facts from it's predacessors fit the puzzle. This film is NOT worthy of the Alien franchse nor universe. It's dull, lifeless and just dissappointing.

B0083SBJXS|5.0|Anything with Joss Wheddon's name has always sucked. Alien Ressurection, Buffy, recently Cabin In The Woods, but I have to be honest about this. It's fact that every film maker will get it write at least once. And I'm happy to anouce that he got it right with the Avengers. I have nothing bad to say about this movie aside the from the dialogue being slightly lame, but that's it. It's a great movie and perfect for the whole family. Great for adults and fun for the kids. Go see it and buy it when it hits DVD and Blu Ray. I will.
B007P06DJK|5.0|I am not a musician and cannot carry a tune.  I love all kinds of music and always felt Paul Simon was a musical/lyrical genius.  I had never listened to the entire Graceland album until I purchased this CD/DVD combo and also the DVD copy of \\"Graceland: The African Concert.  What led me to this sudden cash outlay was the recent airing on cable TV of \\"Under African Skies\\" and recently seeing a live performance of Ladysmith Black Mambazo at a local theater.<br /><br />I firmly believe one should listen to cut 17 on the CD, The Story of \\"Graceland\\" as told by Paul Simon, before listening to \\"Graceland\\" or viewing the DVD. I have listened to cut 17 three times and wish I had studied music when I had the opportunity so I can have a better understanding of Paul Simon's narration. I give it 5 stars because the entire package deserves the highest rating.
B0084IG7KC|1.0|I was board to tears with the slag teen acting and redundent scenes. The direction was inexperianced. The story was unfocused or at least the screenplay. The concept is so perverse. Children of all ages killing each other for the wealthy's entertainment while they're parents starve and work in sweatshops. That's sick! It's no different than ancient gladiators fighting and dying to make the local royalty smile. I'm disgusted with this and found no honor nor seriousness to it what so ever. Last thing. You don't need to read the book to know what's going on because it was extremely cliche' and predictable.
B000MRA5NS|4.0|Good actors, pretty women, plenty of action and an interesting story in a flashy rich surrounding what more do you want in a James Bond movie?<br /><br />I thought that the new James Bond (Daniel Craig) played the part well. His character was interesting. Everyone I thought did their bit.<br /><br />I did like that the villains were not over the top like so many James Bond movies are. I also liked the way the story was reasonable. It is not a villain trying to take on the world just some bankers trying to make a few hundred million.<br /><br />The action was exciting and well done. Some of the jumps took my breath away.<br /><br />I certainly recommend it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Reading reviews I was not sure what to expect. However, I am pleased that I decided to purchase the series.<br /><br />Once I started reading, I could stop until I finished the third book!  I love the story and the different situations going on around the main characters.  The manner in which the story is written is one to stimulate the mind and imagination.<br /><br />I would recommend the books to anyone who loves to read good fiction with a twist.

030758836X|5.0|I have read Ms. Flynn since Sharp Objects (which was a bit forced in many ways,needed major editing, but made me want to read more from this author).  I read Dark Places in two days, and have been waiting to see what she would offer next.<br /><br />I am not going to bore those who read these reviews with the POV, plot, character development as others here have done a very concise job.<br /><br />Nick and Amy....where does one begin?  This is truly a study in psychotic behavior that made me think...do I know anyone quite this twisted and dangerous? I knew a really creepy guy many years ago, but he did not reach the level of danger of Nick/Amy.  I won't even go into the experience I had with a sociopath boss I suffered with for too long.  Suffice it to say, people like this do exist and they are among us in all levels of life.  Ms. Flynn makes this fact very true-to-life.  She did her research.<br /><br />Almost all of the main characters in this story are flawed in major ways, and I only really felt empathy for Nicks' mother and sister.  The rest of the players could have been main characters in their own novel or, at least, a longish short story. At first, I liked Nick and Amy (kind of) but it did not take me long to wish they would both disappear.  Two of the most self-absorbed, selfish, people portrayed in a very realistic way. I did not want to be their friend.<br /><br />There are several twists and turns, but Ms. Flynn drops enough hints that I had most of them figured out ahead of time.  She is such a good storyteller that I did not mind. The device used near the end to explain some physical \\"injuries\\" to Amy seemed rather unbelievable but I chose to overlook that as the rest of the book was so entertaining.<br /><br />In the end, if that is what one wants to call it, I thought, there is some kind of sick justice here except for the major bombshell that I will not disclose which would be a spoiler.<br /><br />I hope that Gillian Flynn is at work on another good story.  If she keeps this up she will keep many of us up all night!

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I did not like this book at all. In my honest opinion, the ending could of been better. However, every reader has their own opinions. I liked the first two of the trilogy, but man this last one takes the cake. It was like eating something that looked good only to be extremely bitter in the mouth. If you like instant and tragic irony, this book is for you.

B005GG0MIS|5.0|This is one of the most interesting and informative books on the presidency I have read.  I am a fan of history and this book delves into the details of key events, while keeping the leading characters, the presidents we believe we know much about, as human beings coping with a shockingly hard role that they strove to attain.  Lessons abound for how to utilize your predecessors in any organization to be more successful.  The personal stories and views of the complex characters of the presidents is enlightening.  You couldn't make this stuff up.  The writing is well done, moving in many places, and the book hooks you at the prologue.  I'm recommending this to everyone I know.

1451627289|5.0|There is not much to say except WOW about this book.  Stephen King has done it again.  This book grabs you right away, sucks you in.  The main character is written so well I felt like I could see him perfectly in my head...and the way the world was described in the 1950's was done so well that I really felt like I didn't need a movie to be right there in it.  Another great book by one of my fav authors!
B000FC1HQY|4.0|This book is about growing up in Africa in the 1970s and 80s, from the point of view of white ranchers.  I enjoyed getting to know these interesting, driven people.  Ms Fuller's prose really puts you there....you see, smell, and feel each situation as she did as a yongster and young adult.  I really had no idea of the reality in Zimbabwe during this period and it is an eye-opener.  A good read!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have to say that since I bought my kindle I have taken chances on many authors who self publish and this is the first time I have fe;lt compelled to leave a review.  The world is believable and the characters are very real. I am reminded of many SF classics I have read over the years and find this as somewhere between Heinlein's \\"The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress\\" and Bradbury's \\"The Martian Chronicles\\". Every time the point of view changed I found myself impatient to find out what would happen next and then just as impatient the next time it switched back. I can't wait for the next one. Add this to \\"A Galaxy Unknown\\" as a series that frustrates only in that I have to wait for the next installment.

B007U2ABXM|5.0|\\"We were going to see the world.\\" There was never a doubt in my mind about the destination. I knew she was going there, and that I was going with her.<br /><br />My inclination when hearing this latest work was to say \\"Welcome back, old friend.\\" My feeling about Patti is whenever she turns up it's like a much-loved friend from high school. We need to get a cup of coffee and catch up at the nearest bistro (not Starbucks.)<br /><br />I first saw Patti on TV on a Sunday night on WWOR channel 9 in the early 1970's referring to subway graffiti as new age Jackson Pollack. It was a black & white documentary of 3 artists speaking on New York City. I noted, \\"keep on eye on this girl.\\"<br /><br />Buy the deluxe edition if you can afford it for no other reason than the hardcovered booklet is a beautiful work of art - photographs, Patti's thoughts and process of what went into creating and recording the music, the lyrics. There's no need on my part to try to summarize or interpret. She's done all the heavy lifting. There are moments of the mystical - especially the discovery of the image of \\"Dream of Constantine.\\" Buy the deluxe edition because it's a BOOK. Kindle will never replace the feeling of turning a page, looking at the images, running your fingers across the page for the first time feeling like silk, opening the book and cracking the spine. It's a gift. The lyrics - poems, really - and the process unfolding are what attracted me to Patti in the first place.<br /><br />I'm reminded of a moment back in the beginning. I was sitting on the floor of the Gotham Book Mart browsing through Joris Huysman's \\"Las Bas\\" first edition. It was pissing down rain. Gotham would never throw you out, even if it was obvious you had no money.<br /><br />At the front was a small tome, \\"Seventh Heaven\\" with Patti's scrawl on front. I bought that instead. I still have it - binding undone, signature fading, much loved and much read. Like \\"Witt,\\" \\"Ha Ha Houdini,\\" \\"Babel.\\" (I got the Huysmans later when I cashed my pay check from E.J. Korvette's down the street where I was Christmas help.) Gotham Book Mart is long gone. Apparently Patti worked there at one point. They were always my \\"go-to\\" place for new Patti stuff. Their logo on a small carved wooden sign: \\"Wise men fish here.\\" (Long live independent book shops!)<br /><br />Now what about the music? Well, I've now been living with it for a week. It's not left my CD player or iPod. It's been playing non-stop. It's so atmospheric that no one song jumps out. It's a dream scape. It's so intuitive I can't stop listening. It's nearly a concept album - and I'm old enough to remember albums - where you put the needle down on the groove and let it engulf you. \\"Banga\\" sinks into your muscles, sinews, spinal column. It's evocative. Like opium.<br /><br />Patti's music took a turn towards the personal around \\"Dream of Life,\\" the album recorded in partnership with her late husband Fred \\"Sonic\\" Smith. (When the heck is the R&R Hall of Fame going to induct the MC5? Storm the bastille of rock commercialism! The people have the power!) Her song to her Godson, \\"Seneca,\\" recalls her lullaby to her own son Jackson on \\"Dream of Life.\\"<br /><br />With \\"Gone Again\\" Patti dealt with the deaths of her husband, her brother, Richard Sohl, and even Kurt Cobain. She needed to write it out, put it out there. There's something akin with \\"Banga.\\" Cursory reviews have all mentioned deaths and dirges but it's never quite that simple with Patti. She feels deeply, and she shares deeply. Many of the songs do reference loss and love. (Isn't it about time that Maria Schneider got a proper send off?)<br /><br />Hearing Patti's voice again with new songs transports me back to Max's Kansas City 1974. She'd added a piano player. (Now, that was a good thing, 'cause Patti couldn't sing and Lenny couldn't play, but Richard Sohl COULD. He had an ability to follow her and Lenny and fill in around them as they improvised transporting word scorcery intosongs.) I had a little reel-to-reel tape recorder and recorded those sets at Max's. Cassettes hadn't been invented yet. I played those reel-to-reel tapes every morning when I got up until \\"Horses\\" came out. My sister, who shared our bedroom, said I ruined her life with it. I wish I still had them. What history! Starting at the beginning, even the Bible starts there, Patti signaled that she was always going to be a work in progress. Many of those classic songs on \\"Horses\\" once had completely different lyrics - like \\"Birdland\\" which began with part of one of her poems \\"Bar stools were made for woman like this.\\" I noted: \\"Keep an eye on this girl.\\"<br /><br />I sold all my college textbooks. I went to Max's every night she and Television  (the opening act with Richard Hell still in the band) for the full week's tenure. There were so few people there, less than I could count on all my fingers and toes, that Max's would let us stay for the late show without paying the cover fee, as long as we ordered the two drink minimum. During \\"Land\\" Patti reached down and took a swig of my Heinekin. (If only she knew how much that cost me.)<br /><br />My relationship with Patti and the band has withstood every way station and change. I saw the band come together bit by bit - first with Jay Dee Dougherty added on the drums. Then Ivan Kral. Nothing will ever come close to \\"Horses\\" but then again, nothing should. The genie came out of the bottle. There was no going back. Any other artist might have been intimidated by such a brilliant debut. Rock history is littered with great first albums never to be repeated. From day one, Patti exuded brazen confidence. She simply creates - in any medium.<br /><br />Another motif running through \\"Banga\\" is adventure, explorers, going across oceans, boundaries, time and the planets themselves. I was at the Academy of Music when she announced she wasn't going to tour again \\"until Ivan Kral gets his citizenship.\\" I thought it was just a plug for the song on \\"Wave\\" but she disappeared to marry, raise children, live a life. \\"Banga\\" is Patti: a wife, a mother, a friend, now Medicare-eligible. In the course of living, creating, evolving, she is timeless and relevant.<br /><br />\\"Banga\\" may be my favorite song on the album. I love the dog howls. I love dogs. My sister just rescued a labrabull from a shelter. Loyalty and love are themes in Patti's work. They are what define us as humans, who are, after all, like dogs, pack animals. Patti stuck with Lenny after every long-forgotten local punk rock band in NYC passed on him as a guitarist. Lenny has turned into quite the musical collaborator, hasn't he? Each of these songs developed almost telepathically - music written separately, independently, yet somehow the perfect foils for Patti's lyrics.<br /><br />\\"Banga\\" is Patti at her best - great poetry. Evocative music. Personal lyrics. She's an artist to her very core. There's been a 30 year progression of incorporating Middle Eastern music into 3-chord rock and roll. There's an immersion of non-traditional rock instruments. \\"Mosaic\\" is hallucinatory. \\"Constantine's Dream\\" is ten-minute journey. Reviews that reference Patti's with punk music may actually miss the whole point. She, and the band, were never punk rock. They once said, \\"we are the last of the hippies.\\" And they are.<br /><br />You'd have to go waaaaayyy back to find anything that approaches \\"Banga\\" - Jim Morrison and the Doors, Arthur Lee and Love, Lou Reed and the Velvets, Grace Slick paraphrasing James Joyce in \\"rejoyce,\\" the Girl Groups of the Shangrilas and Ronettes. Patti always had a bent towards great pop. \\"This is the Girl\\" raises the specter of \\"We Three,\\" and \\"Kimberly.\\" The spoken-word section is pure soul music.  Back in the day Patti would sometimes do a winsome version of the old Motown hit \\"The Hunter Gets Captured By The Game.\\" The same girl who covered \\"Partime Paradise\\" and danced to \\"The 81\\" with Lenny at Bleecker Bob's still lives.<br /><br/>A simple acoustic version of Neil Young's \\"After the Gold Rush\\" slapped me awake from this audio dream. It's spartan, beautiful, and a fitting end with a children's chorus. Ending the deluxe version of the album is a bonus single \\"Just Kids.\\" It's a song version paraphrasing her book of the same name. I noted: \\"keep an eye on this girl.\\"<br /><br />Funny thing. Kinda like \\"6 Degrees of Kevin Bacon.\\" Patti and I both wrote reviews for Creem back in the day. Now, she's a Pulitzer Prize-winning Poet Laureate for America. I write reviews on Amazon. But neither of us ever stopped writing.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Besides the normal wait time for energy the game is enjoyable and I don't find it boring. I would recommend it for those who like these types of games but warn those who are a fan of the original to not expect this to be like it.
B001ECQ4HG|2.0|Can't believe how many great actors are in this film, Brad Pitt, Patricia Arquette, Tom Sizemore,Christian Slater, etc. etc. However, the story and dialog is poorly written. Slater's character goes from being a comic book store salesman to a premeditated killer/defender of call girls in one night (who happens to keep a loaded gun at home, really?). The story line was slow. The best part was Patricia Arquette's performance as \\"Alabama\\" the call girl. She is a tough girl whose beautiful face and figure are not hardly damaged after a violent assault scene by one of the bad guys.I guess she wouldn't have been so sexy and cute if they made her realistically look beaten up. Maybe she's just tough like Superman. The best part of the movie was the last 5 minutes. Twist turner ending, and the fact that it WAS the end. Rate this as a 2 out of 5 stars. Sorry I bought this as a gift for the hubby.

At first, I thought this book was going to be about someone like Julia Roberts in \\"Pretty Woman\\".  By the time I got to Chapter 7, I've decided that all the hype and \\"great\\" reviews were simply in the minds of the media; perhaps, they are receiving kick backs?<br /><br />Anyway, I was certainly relieved to read other comments that express what I was thinking and feeling. I, too, found it boring to have the blushing and lip biting explained over & over. I will not be purchasing the remaining books in this series - much better literature is available.

1781003726|5.0|RESEARCH ON THE PUBLIC - PRIVATE DIVIDE<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Fabrizio Cafaggi had a tremendous task when editing the variety of strands which come together in this fascinating research project as regulation becomes the byword of ensuring compliance with the correct way to go about our different types of business in 21st century... and he succeeds admirably!<br /><br />Cafaggi, with the guidance of a small, international advisory board, has produced an excellent series of `Private Regulation' titles for Edward Elgar Publications. This series is a forum for monographs and collaborative, interdisciplinary volumes from aspects of law, economics, political science, sociology and philosophy.<br /><br />What we have today is a reshaping role for transnational regulation and global governance concerning the distribution of power and opportunities across the world.  This in turn has led to the need for a radical conceptual transformation. This book, in particular, appeals to not only the academic world but to policy makers and practitioners concerned with the design, implementation and enforcement of regulatory policies.<br /><br />The public-private divide remains as important as ever (and as controversial as ever) so both aspects of this transnational regulation fall under the gaze of the editor to make the book both challenging and stimulating for the modern legal researcher at such an interesting economic time.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|The first time I read this book was a year ago, the most recent time I have read it was last week. Cover to cover I have probably read it ten times and the only reason I am just now doing a reveiw is because I normally don't do them. Seeing some other reveiws made me sad; I think everybody and their mother should read it. The first issue was the violence and that \\"it's not appropriate\\" well okay, then neither is watching MMA fights or even the news sometimes. Travis' violence(and, in my opinion, isn't that violent) is his character, he's the macho alpha male and without his flaws there would be no conflict. Abby would just jump for glee and run off into the sunset with him! Another 'pronblem' is gramatical errors. I didn't notice any. I have read some books that are terrible and throughout this book, in all the times I have read it, I may have only noticed one. I love the main characters and their relationship. They don't just immediatly fall it love and readers get to watch their relationship develop. The swoon worthy award goes to Travis. My best friend and I always compair other alpha males to him and they hardly ever come close. From the school to the secondary characters, it all seems very realistic. I felt like I was experiencing everything with Abby and when I finally surfaced after reading it I was depressed to know that I am most definatly not Abby. The only thing to regret after reading Beautiful Disaster is that you read to fast and It's over! I garantee that after reading this when somebody asks \\"Is this book good?\\" while holding up some random, unimportant book, your answer will always be: \\"Not as good as Beautiful Disaster.\\"
1849800014|5.0|FOR EU LEGAL DEVELOPMENT<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />The theme of this work is the theory and practice of legal harmonization in the EU bringing together scholastic contributions under the excellent editorship of Mads Andenas and Camilla Baasch Andersen. Without doubt a daunting task, rightly described as an `ambitious topic' in their Preface.<br /><br />Harmonisation is, indeed, a most important and needed feature of our modern legal system but we still have a long way to go! It is as a core instrument of the EU that there is this need for standardization because many international treaty obligations place duties on Member States today to adopt what is called `conform legislation', ensuring `conform application'- in other words `conformity'.<br /><br />Important examples of this are international and human rights treaties. So, what Edward Elgar Publications have done with this and other similar titles on international law in their series of compilation works is to bring together academics covering a range of legal, social science and humanities disciplines to produce a wide cross section of jurisprudential opinion.<br /><br />By doing this, the editors have provided useful models for, and improvement in, the understanding of the actual harmonization process. The book is for scholars/academics mainly and the editors admit that the wider perspectives and the combination of perspectives from interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary scholarship are, understandably, left outstanding at the moment- most probably because of their rich and demanding nature!<br /><br />What Andenas and Andersen achieve is an excellent explanation of the core instruments for uniformity which greatly contributes to the development of the more general theory of the harmonization process for future global harmonization policies through development in other regions such as Asia, Latin America and Africa.<br /><br />They have explained the critical theory within the EU very well as the scene is set for global theory and practice of harmonisation in the future... we can but hope it will come to pass!ey have explained the critical theory within the EU very well as the scene is set for global theory and practice of harmonisation in the future... we can but hope it will come to pass!

1848449585|5.0|FOR THE FUTURE<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />The essays in this compilation volume have been specially commissioned from leading academics to explore and critically evaluate developments on the economics of corporate law and governance. Edward Elgar's research handbooks are all edited by highly distinguished scholars and are landmark reference works in the series of volumes available.<br /><br />Here, Claire A Hill and Brett H McDonnell offer an advanced treatment of specific topics which cover the state-of-the-art legal research linked to economics and they successfully expand the law and economics debate.<br /><br />The editors say in their introduction that \\"economic analysis plays a crucial role in contemporary scholarly writing on corporate law.\\" They are, of course, correct! Each volume serves as a reference point, and provides introductions to important topics, also suggesting weaknesses and relevant areas for further exploration which readers will find of great help.<br /><br />This research handbook gives splendid practical suggestions for further research so those just starting out on the path of detailed research into corporate law and governance can look to it as an introductory overview.<br /><br />The book has an excellent introduction from the editors giving a short historical overview of the economic analysis of corporate law as well as a description of what is to follow. Part II sketches the origins of the economic analysis of corporate law. Part III sketches how that analysis has developed over the last two decades and Part IV give an overview of the volume.<br /><br />What we have here is research on shaping corporate governance for the future with particular intelligent insights into its constituent parts and it serves as a great detailed introduction for those new to this field.

1848442238|5.0|ON THE NOTION OF DISTRIBUTIVE JUSTICE<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Professors Tania Bubela and E Richard Gold have produced a fascinating work here which aims to describe early efforts at defining and protecting traditional knowledge (TK), both national and international.<br /><br />They also summarize very successfully the existing state of international negotiations on traditional knowledge which have resulted in The Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and The Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit-sharing.<br /><br />Edward Elgar is a well-known family business for international publishing, and they have produced what is accurately described as a comprehensive as well as nuanced and fascinating study on genetic resources which is of great interest to academics, lawyers, political scientists, anthropologists, environmentalists and geographers.<br /><br />The work is also of particular delight for both national and international policymakers who will find the new models on the notion of distributive justice from specific case studies in Brazil, India, Kenya and Canada on the advances of the interests of indigenous peoples of great research value.<br /><br />At the same time, the editors explain the fostering of global scientific innovation with genetic resources, and we welcome the diversity of these studies as they are a continuing conversation on protecting and developing indigenous rights and traditional knowledge in the 21st century develops.
B0032KNA4I|1.0|I knew this movie was a dud but it has some nice special effects and I have a weakness for disaster films.  What I didn't expect was the klutzy way this disc was designed to operate (if it wasn't \\"broken\\").  When pause or fast forward is pressed, the bottom 20% of the screen is overlaid with a background color and a \\"thermometer\\" type set of lines to show how much of the movie has played.  I could find no way to get rid of it.  It became very difficult to read subtitles or to see any action near the bottom of the screen.  The real surprise was when I pressed stop (thinking this might return to full screen mode).  Stopping results in the movie going all the way back to the start.  I could find no way to access a menu at this point to select a scene.  I went through these key punches a couple of time just to be sure the first time wasn't an anomaly.<br />I returned the disc since I refuse to commit to watching the whole 2 hours plus without touching a key.  Now, to add insult to injury, SONY also won't let you skip the ads at the start of the disc.  I was already mad at them for adding another warning (which this disc has too) stating that they are not responsible for what you see in the movie. If that is so, how can they take money for someone else's work?  No wonder SONY is losing billions.  They deserve to.
1843762609|5.0|OF GLOBAL ECONOMIES<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />A growth of services in the economy has taken place in the last few years although there was little by way of scholarly literature to explain the expanding role of trade in services in the global economy.<br /><br />Edward Elgar Publications have produced the excellent two volume collection under the editorship of Bernard Hoekman to redress the balance. A leading analyst in the field, Hoekman has collated the seminal works on the WTO and trade in services which have been published over the past decades.<br /><br />The two volumes cover a range of materials including the determinants and patterns of trade in services; services in regional integration agreements and the GATS.<br /><br />\\"The WTO and Trade in Services\\" offers great value to academics, policymakers and practitioners in this increasingly important area of study as the services-intensity of global economies continues to expand and we are very grateful to Elgar for this most useful and apposite compilation.
B005XI91FY|5.0|This album does rock as hard as Steel Panther's first album \\"Feel the Steel\\" but it is more 'real' music and less a parody of other 80's glam metal cliches.  The songs are great, with more emphasis on rockin' than funny lyrics.  The lyric are good, and funny, as is typical with these guys.<br /><br />I have some Steel Panther songs in a glam metal playlist and you can tell them right away by the intensity and total rocking sound.  They overshadow other groups in the playlist like LA Guns, and even Poison.

B0059WTMLW|5.0|I love SODOKU i cant wait to play i have wanted this game to be on for a long time!!!!!! i will be playong this alot!!!
B007MDB71O|5.0|I loved this film! It was fun, imaginative and had lots of action. The story was well written--ok so it's not high literature, who cares?--it was unique and original. With plot twists that I did not expect. How many films can say that? So many movies these days are too predictable. I really liked the entire cast too. There were several of my favorites there. I lost track of time while watching John Carter. It left me wanting to see more of Barsoom, John Carter and the princess. I wanted to see what happened next.<br /><br />Disney blew it big time. The title was neither exotic nor original. It did not convey what this film was about. Disney has some of the most creativity in the film industry. The marketing was all wrong too. Quite frankly they did not do enough to promote this movie.  The critics who panned this movie. The previous reviewer who accused who? of 'padding the stars'-they're entitled to their opinions. I really disagree. John Carter is worth buying. If you haven't seen it--watch it. You won't be disappointed.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|way way too cheap for such an awesome game........ but it isn't so cool until you complete all of the missions first... then you have a lot of guns and money.
B0013TXA5Y|2.0|I gave this a read on the recommendation of a friend, and because I'd heard that a movie was on the horizon for the series. After slogging my way through a forest of bad cliches, flat characters, and painful dialogue, the only thing keeping me reading was wanting to give it a good shot for my friend's sake. I didn't know that Cassandra Clare had gotten her start in fanfiction until I read a couple of the other reviews just now, but now it suddenly makes sense why the book felt like it was ripping off half a dozen better books all the time. Also, I'd noticed how the author and the main character shared the name \\"Clare/Clary\\", which, combined with stuff like the main character's effortless beauty and Mary Sue-like cluelessness about how she's the center on the universe, made this read like a wish-fulfillment fantasy instead of an attempt to tell a compelling story.<br /><br />It's not all bad though. I really did enjoy the romance between Jace and Clary - enough that, after finishing this book, I went onto Wikipedia and read the plot summaries of the rest of the series to see where it was going. I also liked the supernatural/occult feel of the worldbuilding, but wished it'd been fleshed out and thought through to give it more depth.<br /><br />(Spoiler alert) For example, at one point in the book, a guy afflicted with werewolfism shows up and tells the tale of how he became a werewolf. He says that after being exiled from his community, he went through the woods and ran across a werewolf community, got into a fight with the main werewolf, and wouldn't you know, killed the head werewolf, so now he's in charge! This is fairly common to werewolf lore, but I was disappointed because ALL the werewolves' personalities and behaviors are reduced to one flat aspect of \\"pack behavior\\". It's used as a shorthand so that the author doesn't have to make them feel like real people with real motivations. Having just read Patricia Briggs's \\"Moon-Called\\", which explores in great depththe idea of pack behavior as a complex and unpredictable plot dynamic, it was disappointing to see so little TLC devoted to making the characters and their motivations believable. And this problem is not just restricted to the werewolves: City of Bones is stuffed full of supernatural creatures and societies that are little more than cardboard scenery in the background of a school play. I kept wanting to get sucked into the world and enjoy the book, but there is a huge problem when the supernatural creatures are just boring. I feel like the author thought that the creatures in and of themselves would make the book non-boring, but honestly, I'd prefer to read about well-written and well-motivated accountants rather than swarms of fantasy creatures that are flat and predictable.<br /><br />The funny thing is that I think this book will make a far better movie than it did a book. This is because the author seemed to be writing the book as if she were watching a movie and making a transcript of it, instead of writing a book. Books and movies are two different mediums, and loan themselves to very different conventions to make them interesting. In a movie, you can have a long, drawn-out action sequence that holds your attention because of the visuals. In a book, the action requires more skill to write, and if the action doesn't contribute to the plot, then it should be cut. This is how I felt about the sequence in the middle of the book where the heroes go through a vampire hotel. I started flipping through dozens of pages, and NOTHING WAS HAPPENING. There was no interesting character development. There was no introduction of a good villain. There was no setup for something important that would happen later. There was no clever humor or buildup of atmosphere. You could skip the entire chapter and not miss anything.<br /><br />And this is the big problem with the book. It's too long, too boring, too predictable, and it is in desperate need of three or four more edits and some character rewrites. I honestly believe that there was a decent book buried somewhere in here, and that it'll make a decent movie in the hands of a competent director and screenwriter. At the very least, a movie won't take more than two hours of my life away. I just think Ms. Clare's editors really dropped the ball on this one. It says something when I got more satisfaction and enjoyment over reading the Wikipedia articles rather than the book. If you, like me, are mainly here because of the movies, save your time and money and enjoy the summaries on Wikipedia instead.
B000VSAEYI|5.0|Bought this when the price was around $38 = excellent price for fun product.<br /><br />Major pros.<br />1. Fun and engaging design. Bright colors with fun backdrop of characters on the bottom of the pool. Whale and turtle directly relate to the inflatable accessory toys to complete the \\"animal families\\". Our baby likes to climb back and forth from the wading area to the main wading area. Slide is fun with the additional pillow cushion to soften the landing. Our toddler is above average in height and has no problem getting down the slide; head first, with a little bounce, climbs up, hides underneath the slide in the wading area from her baby brother, etc. = great fun.<br /><br />2. Generous size to accommodate an adult as well as multiple small children. Height is also appropriate for a outdoor water fun. For cooling down on a hot day rather than any type of swimming.<br /><br />3. Sprinkler is great for stimulation and minimizing water intake (fills up pool slowly, but surely this way keeping you cool and avoid having to sit in cold water).<br /><br />4. It is of stout materials and considerate design. I have purchased several of these inflatable types in the past several years for young children and I find the quality to be very good. A drainage exit for each wading area and an additional exit for overflow in the wading area. Toys are great additions and are of generous size.<br /><br />Obvious cons.<br />1. Inflatable pools have limited outdoor usage life. Nature of the beast. It is a large set up and a challenge for one person to maintain, but if you are motivated and determined keep in mind our toddler's response, \\"Mommy, thank you so much! Do you know, I love it, mommy! I love my new pool so much!\\"

0345803493|5.0|I am completely and utterly in love with Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele. I am in a word captivated by their love story. I have become very protective over these stories and find myself feeling like I must defend it against those who have given them bad reviews. I read the negative reviews and wonder how people can so greatly differ in opinions in regards to such a beautiful story. But as they say, this is what makes the world go around. I for one am very happy that I am part of the \\"I love it\\" camp as even thinking about these two characters brings a smile to my face and this must be a good thing.<br /><br />In Fifty Shades Darker we see a 'younger' Christian. We finally see a shy smile, his boyishness and of course his need to protect Ana at all costs is at an utmost high. I did find myself yelling at my Kindle a few times when it came to Ana. I didn't catch myself doing this in part 1 but a few times she irritated me to no end. She is not one that should be allowed to say that Christian is moody, she is in my opinion more moody than him in part 2. Yes he is exhausting with his need to protect her, see I do not use the word control because I do not see it like that. This is a man who is haunted by his childhood. He was not protected, he has found love and now he wants to protect that. However, by the second half of the book she proved herself to me yet again and the annoyance I was feeling eroded away. Ana has just as hard a time as Christian when it comes to believing that the other could love them.<br /><br />I also hate myself for saying this but I dislike Kate. She annoyed be in part 1 and even more so in part 2. Thankfully she was not around much, however for the brief moment she is I wanted nothing more than to slap her. I know she is Ana's friend but I just want her to mind her own business.<br /><br />There are so many parts of this book that I will always remember. I have honestly laughed out loud, I have found myself holding my breath during tense scenes, I have smiled until I feel silly at doing it and I have cried. I have honestly lost how many times I have cried during Fifty Shades Darker. Christian's story affects me, it is really as simple as that. And being able to see him overcoming all he has gone through, to fight for his right to love and be loved. Well, lets just say it is a beautiful thing to witness. When he knelled before Ana, afraid of her running... it was so heartbreakingly sad and beautiful at that same time.<br /><br />I could not praise these books any higher and am so thankful that I decided to read them. I was hesitant to start as when I would ask others what they were about the only answer given to me was 'sex'. These books are about so much more. There is sex yes (and lots of it) but it is those moments that help define these two people. Those moments have so much changed from part 1 into part 2. It shows how they are changing and growing with the help of each other.<br /><br />I am now off to start the final part, Fifty Shades Freed. I am both excited and saddened by this. I can not wait to immerse myself yet again in their lives but feel I will be quite sad when there is not another book for me to start.enes, I have smiled until I feel silly at doing it and I have cried.

B007V2UGPE|2.0|so I haven't  played the game yet but reading the reviews it stinks and i've deleted a bunch of games but it still says I don't have enough space so save time and don't get it.
B0055SWM08|4.0|I love this game. No problems on my Toshiba Thrive. Hard enough to be challenging but not so hard that it is frustrating. A great escape from work. Only problem is that you won't want to stop. like the idea that you can get hints when needed. would have given 5 stars but don't want developers to think that there could not be improvements, even though I don't know what they might be.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is the best game you will ever play and it is also cool that it is free.The monky demons are creapy but the game is easy until you get to 1000 meters that isthe very hard part.Have fun playing.
1439102732|3.0|I have to say I've read many of Jodi Picoult's books and really liked most of them.  I liked this book too in the beginning with Zoe and Max trying to have a baby and all they went through.  But the relationship between Zoe and Vanessa really soured me on this book.  I'm not against gays but I don't want to read about what they do in the bedroom.  I don't want to know about their intimate moments, and this book describes everything they do.  I did not finish the book.  It actually made me feel sick to read some of the descriptions in the book.  I had to leave it.
B004QYTRRS|4.0|Great movie. I don't know why people rate this movie so low. It's a good movie with a twist at the end, it keeps you guessing! Would definitely watch again. :)
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is great I cant believe they finally made it for amozon products this was the first app when I got my kindle that I wanted to get I so happy it is a really fun game.
B00000CQJZ|3.0|I had seen a play with the same name.  Because of the rapid action, I found it difficult to make sense of it.  I ordered the original movie, hoping to learn what was significant about The 39 Steps.  Because of the rapid action, British accents etc, I was not able to learn about The 39 steps.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have played a few of these on my kindle fire and I like this one the most. nice smooth game play, mild Colorado. the advertising isn't too obnoxious. there are times it will play a commercial (video) but that is seldom. you will like this if you like solitaire.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a riveting story from beginning to end.  I literally could not put it down!!  I would recommend it for anyone of any age that wants to lose themselves in a good story.
B000JSI7AI|4.0|Great for dvd .. it's 2 disc edition with a lot limited collector's card. transfer pciture not good like blu-ray. perhaps maybe i buy it because said it collector's. But for drama transfer picture average
0345803493|5.0|This book was my favorite of the 3. More comical banter, romance, a deeper side of Mr. Christian Grey. You learn more about what makes him tick, as his relationship progresses. A little is learned about his background as well, wihich is interesting.
B0002IQNAG|4.0|Why have dvd so collectible than blu-ray ? this edition have a comic book. it's have four disc. So i buy it and prices it's make sense. Maybe someday i think to buy blu-ray edition.
0345803507|3.0|There is a lot of information literally shoved into the last book. There is a lot of back and forth flash backs vs current, which kind of drove me nuts. I couldn't wait for that to do over with. I was grateful the whole book wasn't that way.<br />A lot is learned about Christian and his past in this book.<br />This was my least favorite book of the entire trilogy. It felt rushed and under a massive deadline. It did not have the same enjoyable flow of the other books.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|Not bad for less than 5 bucks.  Gives you something to do when you need to pass the time. It is a fun game.
B007P06DO0|5.0|Well, reviewing reissues are always a bit interesting.  To be fair, I guess you have to judge the product on its own and this is a beautiful package - amazing CD's, two books and two good DVD's so there's no way to judge this less than 5 stars.  Having said that though it's also pretty fair to complain a little.  Just like the first reviewer, I bought this CD in 1987, a enhanced copy quite a while ago and then as part of the boxed set about 5 years ago.  So, as far as music, you get two additional demos only (that do not even have singing on them) and you get the 1987 concert which any self respecting Simon fan already has, and you get the new DVD documentary and a couple of booklets.<br /><br />It's a lot of money for little new stuff, but the book is nice and the new DVD is interesting.  Truth be told however, I am having a little buyers remorse.  I probably just should have bought the new DVD on its own, but even the DVD is a bit disppointing.  I am wondering why the DVD focuses so much on the rehearsals for what looks to be a great reunion show, but then we are not trated to the show itself.
B0059WTMLW|1.0|too bad it has open feint.  it is a truly malicious virus.  do not download, unless of course you enjoy exposure of your personal information. shame on amazon for foisting this on its customers.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|As a long time fan of the Beach Boys I had my doubts about the quality of a reunion tour and accompanying LP.  I had been to 2 reunion shows before the release of the new CD and was amazed at the work and rehearsal that went into their long and deep show.  As a hard core fan, might I have some suggestions how to make it better for me? \\"You bet\\" but the singing, arranging and showmanship in the shows were stellar.  And even hearing Mike Love adknowledge that the song line up was in deference to both the casual and hard core fan was more than I expected to hear from him.<br />So the only New LP cut in the first two shows I was was the title track. I would really have hoped for a more commercial sounding song for a lead single yet the singing and harmonies are amazing.  It's pretty much what Bruce Johnston advertised.  \\"If you love soaring harmonies you'll love this song\\"<br /><br />I don't see there being a weak cut on this set.  They are all well sung, amazingly arranged and produced.  Yes I've heard the nay sayers regarding auto tune etc..... but this is 2012.  Do you want a contemporary sounding mix or not? is my take.<br /><br />I'm not a huge fan of a lot of Mike Loves later attempts at lyrical wordsmithing and this disc doesn't change my opinion on that count.  There certainly aren't any.. \\"I looked in the mirror it couldn't be clearer\\" type rhymes though on the record and  other than a few tired references to old Beach Boy Tunes/Lyrics, He's done a good job here.  Anyway.... there is a certain charm to all of the guys.. and I like them over the last 40 years as a fan for what they are.... much more than what I wish they were.  You don't constantly demand a friend be something their not.... Mike is Mike and he's an integral part of the group.<br /><br />I think the surprising stand out on this record is Al Jardine.  Mabye not so suprising after all.  He is in exceptional voice both live and on this record and his many leads are outstanding, though I would have liked to hear one of his compositions here.<br /><br />Isn't It Time, Spring Vacation and Strange World are by far my favourite of the up tempo tunes.  I've found myself screaming them loudly has I'm cruising in my car.  They're awsome summer drive tunes and very catchy!!<br /><br />Lyrically, this collection is a huge departure from your typical Beach Boys record.  They've set up an amazing reality of where they are and where they've been in their lives.  No more forced SUM SUM SUM OF YOUR LOVE.... kind of thing.  It's introspective and in a way nostalgic, but from a reality standpoint.  Lets face it.  They're old guys now.  All of them in their late 60's and early 70's.  They've admitted their time is limited now for this earth.  Isn't that really the fresh outlook they always had...  At one point they sang,,,, \\"Well I'm young and free, and how will it be , When I grow up to be a man\\"  Now they're saying...  \\"you've been thinking bout the things we used to do.  Thinkin bout when life was still in front of you, back where you belong, our favourite song, Wont you listen\\"  That is one deep and beautiful lyric.  THen you stop and listen and Brian Wilsons genius fills your ears with the rest of that song (From There To Back Again) and two more songs to end this journey, (Pacific Coast Highway), and Summer's Gone)  with the best writing and soaring harmonies IMHO that he's done since Pet Sounds and Smile.  It is absolutely breathtakingly fresh, honest.  Blunt reality but softened with beautiful metaphor.  This is a wonderful set of songs that deserved to be heard.

B00461MY30|3.0|no, these are not the best sounding rolling stones LPS out there.  those would be the original LONDON/DECCA pressings.  i have most of those, and these records sound lacking in detail & dynamics in comparison.  these are, however, a huge leap up from the electronically processed stereo records out there.  and yes, as others have pointed out, given what the original pressings are selling for on ebay, this set is a bargain.  the vinyl is nice & heavy, and very quiet.  one of my biggest issues is how BAD the covers look...they are just off.  they look like first generation laser photocopies!  i'm not sure if the source material was just poorly scanned, or if the printing job was just botched.  in any case, when held side by side to the originals, it's pretty clear the art isn't as nice.  i might be alone in this, but for my part, i wish the whole set was MONO.  to my ears, the mono mixes just sound better...particular for a record like BETWEEN THE BUTTONS, where the choice of panning on the stereo version just sounds like a novelty. (which it kinda was at the time). so, yeah, mixed feelings.  it's great to own all of these records in one purchase, and i'm sitting here listening to them all in chronological order, remembering (yet again) what amazing records the rolling stones made.  i'd say, if you don't own these records on vinyl yet, and want to get your feet wet, this is an amazing place to start.
B00005O3VD|5.0|i got mine from inetvideo for like $3.80 still in wrapping and was brand new, works perfectly, and got here quick too! the movie is excellent, with amazing songs and costumes. definitely one of my top two favorite musicals. and for all of you who aren't big on barbra streisand, i must admit, i used to be the same way. yes,, she was great in hello dolly, but she just kinda blipped off my radar, and this turned it around. her acting is superb, as well as her singing, no doubt. it's a very entertaining funny movie that will weave itself through your heart strings.
B007UXSDYU|2.0|Whoever is responsible for this needs therapy. It had basically no plot. The scenarios just repeated themselves until everyone had gone crazy.

B0060ZJ78U|1.0|This review only relates to the Ultraviolet \\"digital copy\\" -  I bought this because in addition to the Blu-Ray/DVD Combo there was a digital copy.  The problem is that the digital copy is Ultraviolet.  After spending forever signing up with Ultraviolet and Univeral websites, I still don't have a digital copy.  All the other movies I've previously purdchased with a \\"digital copy\\" have been very easy to access through itunes.  I won't buy any DVD movie that is associated with a digital copy through Ultraviolet again.  It's not worth it and it's not a true digital copy in my opinion.
0440246016|5.0|YOU DO NOT MESS WITH THE SPECIAL INVESTIGATORS!<br /><br />Jack Reacher, ex military policeman, lives off the grid. He has no cell phone, no address, and no belongings outside of his folding toothbrush. He's happy in his solitude until he receives a coded message from an old military comrade, Frances Neagley. She took a lot of trouble to track him down, using his bank account to send a cry for help.<br /><br />When Jack reaches Los Angeles, he tracks Neagley to a Denny's restaurant. She's waiting for him as she knew he would track her there. She imparts some very disturbing news, one of the former investigators in their unit is dead. It was not a pretty death, and as an autopsy later confirmed, he had been tortured, starved and beaten prior to being thrown alive out of a helicopter. She reminds Reacher of the team's slogan 'You do not mess with the Special Investigators!'<br /><br />When Neagley and Reacher try to contact the remaining members of their former special investigators unit, the worry ratchets up a notch, with each unanswered phone call. None of their old unit is answering, where are they? Are they all missing? Or are they all dead?<br /><br />When O'Donnell and then Dixon show up in Los Angeles, they unite with Neagley and Reacher. With the discovery of another team member's body, and no contact with the others, they realize that someone is after their unit and doing a pretty good job of it.<br /><br />As the team delves deeper and deeper into the events leading up to their friends demises, they realize that what they have discovered points to a major threat to nation security, with the possibility of thousands of deaths.<br /><br />The team races to save the country and then two more are gone. Will they hand the problem over to the FBI and Homeland Security or will they decide the lives of two more of their own are worth more? With time quickly running out will they be able to save their friends or will they lose them and more?<br /><br />This is a great stand alone book. I love the pace, the action starts at the beginning and continues to grow as the book moves quickly along. The tension gets tighter and tighter, the characters more nervous and unsure of themselves. The scenes are very well written, very descriptive and colorful. The characters, even the bad guys, are 3 dimensional and believable. What makes this book even more of a heart pounder is the believability of what is happening and what could potentially happen. An awesome read!at stand alone book.

B005LAIHXQ|1.0|Headline: \\"Sci-Fi Buff Endures 6 Months of Hype for Bitter Disappointment.\\" The truth is, the special effects, acting, and \\"look\\" in Prometheus are all fine. However (and sadly), the story is shallow, disjointed, and weak. The writing is mediocre-to-bad, the casting (with 2 notable exceptions) is terrible, and the direction is well below par. Had they all been as good as the special effects, acting, and \\"look,\\" this film would have been a solid 4.5 movie that I would want to own. As it is, it is (or should be) a bow-wow embarrassment to the people who put up the money and to those who acted in it.<br /><br />This comes on the heals of a string of bloated, over-hyped (relative to the actual quality of the film) Sci-Fi disappointments from Hollywood. I'm thinking specifically of \\"John Carter\\" and (dare I say it in public) \\"Avatar.\\" This suggests that there is something seriously amiss in Hollywood's connection with the genre. Perhaps there is just too much money chasing too few scripts (not to mention, GOOD scripts).<br /><br />My suggestion: Skip \\"Prometheus,\\" and rent/purchase/watch: \\"Blade Runner,\\" \\"Splice,\\" the first \\"Terminator,\\" \\"Never Let Me Go,\\"The Abyss,\\" \\"Dark City,\\" \\"Contact,\\" \\"The Hunger,\\" \\"Aeonflux,\\" \\"Dark City,\\" \\"Pitch Black,\\" \\"Bicentennial Man,\\" the first \\"Starship Troopers,\\" any of the \\"Alien/Aliens\\" flicks, and/or the first \\"Preditor.\\" None of these are perfect, all are flawed... and all are superior movies to Hollywood's latest, vapid offerings.

B0079J28NW|5.0|This is a great movie, the jokes are very witty, the story is somewhat predictable but the great songs carry it with the innovative animation.<br />Apart from the first four Disney classics, this is the best animated movie ever made in my opinion.  Even the Yellow Submarine song (not my favorite song) works in the movie.  Not just for Beatle fans, (I don't really count myself as one).

B0059WTMLW|5.0|[BIG THANKS TO AMY]<br /><br />A little over a year later, this app made its second debut as the Free App of the Day.  What's Changed?  Something for the better.<br /><br />When I saw this as the Free App of the Day the second time around, I found this review once again, and noticed another reviewer, Amy, reported that OpenFeint and Flurry were both removed.  The second thing I noticed was my review on which the headline said that 'Hidden \\"Flurry Analytics\\" Spies On You', so decided that I needed to take another look to see if my original review still held value.<br /><br />I'm pleased to report that Amy is indeed correct.  A year later, Flurry is gone and OpenFeint is *dead* (long may it stay that way).  Hooray!  Too bad the developer never contacted me sooner, though.<br /><br />The game is still more difficult than they are rated, but for other than \\"very easy\\" that's probably a good thing.  There are some really fun variants in this version, and the mechanics are fantastic.  As I said in my original review, this is a 5-star game that was hammered for having OpenFeint and Flurry Analytics.  With those gone, I'm happy to revisit and update this review to give it the five stars this app deserves.<br /><br />(And *THANK YOU* to Amy for reporting this first!)<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Robert~<br />28JUN2013<br /><br />*** ORIGINAL REVIEW ***<br />Hidden \\"Flurry Analytics\\" Spies On You<br />[09JUN2013]<br /><br />One star removed for openfeint, but at least the option to disable it was there, and the developer let us know in the product's description that it was there.<br /><br />Since this is a full-featured sudoku game with every bell and whistle, I planned on giving that star back for quality and thoughtfulness.  That changed instantly when I went into the settings and found \\"Flurry Analytics \\" already set to send info over the internet.<br /><br />Through your reviews, let this and other developers know that Opt-IN is the only acceptable method of data collection.  This is especially important when that data collection is hidden and you aren't notified up front.<br /><br />[EDIT: cleaned up the first line of the third paragraph for clarity]<br /><br />** ADDENDUM ** [09JUN2012]<br /><br />Let me be clear that I think the game is top-notch, and worthy of five stars - despite the OpenFeint - if the Flurry Analytics are turned off and the user is given the option to opt-in to the tracking.  When the developer does this, I would consider revising my star rating upward to reflect this.  (PS, the 'Very Easy' is more 'Moderate'; I can't imagine trying the Nightmare setting!).<br /><br />Also my hope that this gets the message out to developers how to handle these things: First, it is better to not have OpenFeint; and Second, any tracking needs to be opt-in and upfront with the user.This is especially important when that data collection is hidden and you aren't notified up front.<br /><br />[EDIT: cleaned up the first line of the third paragraph for clarity]<br /><br />** ADDENDUM ** [09JUN2012]<br /><br />Let me be clear that I think the game is top-notch, and worthy of five stars - despite the OpenFeint - if the Flurry Analytics are turned off and the user is given the option to opt-in to the tracking.

Do not listen to these negative reviewers, they are just using it as Resistance to doing their real work. Read it and you'll know what I'm talking about.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|I have read books similar and thought these would be as good.  The triology Sleeping beauty by Anne Rice was more erotic than these.  1/3 of the books were repeat phrases \\"Laters\\", \\"oh jeez\\" and her biting her lip all the time.  For the money I just thought there would be more meat on the bones.  Honestly it was like reading a  glorified Harlequin Romance.

B0074JODP8|2.0|Joe is obviously an excellent musician, his guitar pyrotechnics are only matched by a very few.  That said, I expected much, much more from this DVD than I got.  First, the audio was slightly muddy, an inexcusable happening with the technology available today.  Then the video was fuzzy and colors washed in strange ways, probably because of stage lights, so I'd give that one except I've seen many with colored lights on stage that didn't mess up the video.  Finally, Joe himself.  When he sticks to the guitar, he's fantastic, but you can't watch a couple hours of that without songs attached.  There are about 3-5 good songs on this DVD, and 2 of those are by his guests!  His vocals are slurred, muffed, and unfathomable.  The songs themselves, other than the handful mentioned, are just plain boring. If he'd hire a songwriter and a singer, he'd be much better off.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|First off - Disney should never have allowed this to be a $250M movie - BUT - it is what it is..  A great action/adventure/love story that should be able to get 4-7 additional sequels - I wish they had only spent, say - $150M.<br />This has already made $300M in the box offices - worldwide - it will likely make another $150-200M in DVD and rentals..  I say bring on the sequel - it's got to be cheaper to make part 2, not that all the money was put into part 1..<br />I rented this movie, now I am adding it to my collection and buying the 3D version along with it - can;t wait to see it in 3D

B005IQZB14|2.0|I wanted to really like this book...it was just ok. There is no doubt she has courage to hike 1,100 miles and to write a memoir. The book was a bit repetitive at times which made it seem like she was whining a lot -- maybe better editing might have helped? I did admire the way she pushed away her fear while hiking alone.

I wanted to experience first hand the revolution and trials but in the end we only briefly heard about them after she woke up from yet another morphine coma. I didn't care for the direction the book took....they essentially broke down her fierce and courageous personality and we ended up seeing Katniss evolve into her mother, the very person she despised in the previous books.

B0083GQKQG|5.0|I just finished this movie about a minute ago and I had to write a review. This movie is absolutely terrifying. We get to know each and every character like they are our own family, and we see what they are going through. We feel the pain of the mother, the complete oblivion in the father, the total innocence of the little daughter, the pure hatred and hurt in the townspeople, and last but not least, the absolute evil in Kevin. This is not just a plain old movie about a messed up kid you guys, this is special. The movie creates an attachment between the viewer and characters immediately, combined with outstanding performances by the actors. This is one that I would highly recommend to not all viewers, but those who seek a movie that evokes very deep feelings and emotions.
1451627289|5.0|Like another reviewer said, this book reminds me of the depth and intensity of The Stand.  I'm a guy and the ending of the book caused my eyes to water.  It's that good a book.  Vivid imagery and character development.
B007HO392S|4.0|Carrie's new disc is LITTERED with good songs. From the catchy \\"Good Girl\\", to the inspired \\"Nobody Ever Told You\\" (my fave), to the heartbreaking \\"Wine After Whiskey\\" to the beautiful \\"Good In Goodbye\\", most of these are very good tracks. I appreciate that Underwood is writing more and more as her career goes on because it's inspiring to hear her own lyrics and thoughts instead of someone else's like on her first disc (which is my favorite still, great disc!).<br /><br />2009's [[ASIN:B002DYJAIY Play On]] had some good tracks too, but also some filler. Besides the average \\"Thank God For Hometowns\\" this album was a true success. I am blessed to have watched American Idol season 4, saw Carrie win and allowed to follow her blossoming career. Also blessed to experience a voice like hers. She and Taylor Swift are my favorite artists in the country pop genre. No contest.<br /><br />4.25 stars (not an average).<br /><br />DOWNLOAD:<br />\\"Nobody Ever Told You\\"<br />\\"Do You Think About Me\\"<br />\\"See You Again\\" &<br />\\"Good Girl\\"

0345803493|4.0|The storyline in this series is pretty good, but some of the writer's tendencies really kept me from fully enjoying the first book.  The repetitious \\"Inner Goddess\\" seems to appear in every other sentence.  The second book has much less of this and I enjoyed the story much more!  This book has much less pointless content.  The first book could have probably been cut down by 100 pages if all the pointless stuff was removed.  With all that being said, the story of Christian and Ana is really a good one, and I am sure that this author will only get better with each novel, as you can already see improvement in her writing skill from the first book to this one!

B00845PV16|3.0|I would give this a 2, but Idris Elba is worth another star. This was not as good as the first one. Nick Cage was weird, and not in a good way. His acting was over the top and missed the mark in just about every scene. So disappointing! I'm sorry I purchased it. Spent $18, what the frack!

B007Y36K46|5.0|This is not Shakespeare.  It's a Star Wars/Tarzan type story.<br /><br />The movie is well made.  The details in animation and costume design are delightful.<br /><br />Though I like short, taut movies, my only complaint is that this one needed to be slightly longer for better development of the plot.  My guess is that for most of the audience, many plot elements (such as the Queen realizing that Carter is already in love with another woman) will be lost to them due to cursory treatment - which is a shame.<br /><br />I read the negative reviews when they first came out, and avoided this movie in the theater.  What a mistake.  Not sure what the critics were smoking when they watched this film, although my guess is that the majority of them critiqued it against Schindler's List instead of Tarzan.<br /><br />I must pay a particular compliment to the acting of the lead female playing the Queen (never heard of her and don't recall her name).  I'd be astonished if she didn't have professional acting credentials of the Shakespearian caliber - because frankly her range of expression was boggling.  Though the critical reviews mentioned the \\"no-name\\" stars, this actress was anything but; my guess is that she could act any part, from villain to saint, the more complicated the better.  I hope to see her in something else soon enough.  The male lead acting was also quite good, even though his character would have better shined if allowed to be more edgy.<br /><br />Overall though I say bravo.  Too bad the Disney chief in charge of this lost his job.  I think it was money well spent, as movies of this caliber in this genre and setting are few and far between.
B007VDPMYI|5.0|I can never figure out some reviews. Being pizzed off about CD length is alright, but to rate the music bad because of it is rather silly, and a bit childish. Believe it or not, people DO realize that 30 track CD's are usually compressed beyound quality recognition. Also the CD is PRICED for its size.<br /><br />The other is these are EARLY TAKES of many classic Harrison tunes. Even on the DVD Bio it states VERBATIM what they are, (\\"Awaiting On You All\\" for example). This is a great and rare event when we can see into the makings of a great song, raw and to the point. For a Harrison music fan, which I am, this is a must have... Much like the Beatles anthology series, it gives you much more insight to the man and his music, and musings. Being a Beatle fan, I always love the outtakes and early versions of their song. While My Guitar Gently Weeps and All Things Must Pass are prime examples (while not on this CD).<br /><br />If you are a George Harrison fan, this is \\"required reading\\", showing the evolution of these songs and his style.<br /><br />As far as his \\"personal\\" life, thats just what it is. He was a human being.  Take a look at your CD collection..look at the major artists..now hold that same standard to them or be a hypocrite.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Anyone else in this boat?  I loved the series up to this point.  But there are so many great reads at more reasonable prices (I buy kindle/digital editions) that I have not found myself inclined to push the 1-click.<br /><br />It has been a long time since I read the previous book in this series, and find my memory of it faded and my interest in the series flagging.  Martin's publisher should re-think their pricing strategy; they will probably lose money and fans due to such inflated pricing.

B005LAIHXQ|4.0|PROMETHEUS may be a prequel to ALIEN, but fixating too much on making those connections will probably sabotage your overall enjoyment of the film. After more than three decades Ridley Scott returns to the franchise that established a new watershed mark for sci-fi horror. That's plenty of time to stew things over for a sequel. But while PROMETHEUS does address a few questions, it frustratingly raises even more. Case in point, the mystery of the Space Jockey figure. Still, I appreciate that the narrative doesn't spoonfeed you the answers.<br /><br />In 2093 the deep space vessel Prometheus, spurred by a clue 35,000 years old, journeys to a distant and inhospitable moon in search of mankind's origins. Prometheus is manned by a crew of seventeen, many of them anonymous cannon fodder. On the barren moon a scouting team eyes a vast, unnatural construct and explores it. Inside they find air that is breathable... and the remains of an ancient alien civilization.<br /><br />Prepare to be gobsmacked by the eloquence and scope of Ridley's storytelling. The set designs are magnificently realized and, gratifyingly, still very much influenced by H.R. Giger's ominous surrealism. For those who may get their Scotts and Camerons confused, PROMETHEUS is more reminiscent of ALIEN in its slow burn evocation of atmosphere and tone. The tone itself is contemplative. There's an exploration into the metaphysical stuff, into the relationship between science and religion. The story takes its time but builds to a blistering crescendo. The spooky bits are parceled out in measured doses; Scott once more prefers to let your imagination do the work. Honestly, the film is heavy on mood but light on terror. It does eventually unleash several nice scares, and ****REST-OF-SENTENCE SPOILER NOW**** particularly one harrowing moment involving a cringe-inducing bout of self-surgery.<br /><br />Next to THE AVENGERS and THE DARK KNIGHT RISES, PROMETHEUS is this summer's most anticipated film. Which leaves it vulnerable for a letdown, expectations being so high. Those going in the theater salivating for a comprehensive backstory will probably exit grumbling. There is a connective tissue, but Ridley Scott doesn't confine himself to the ALIEN mythos and with crossing t's and dotting i's. He expands on it, paints a bigger canvas. He introduces even more concepts. He lays in the puzzle of the Space Jockeys, who we learn are genetic engineers who may have created humanity. We're left questioning their motivations with regards to the human race.<br /><br />The film gives us expert direction, staggering visual effects, marvelous acting. Noomi Rapace's archaeologist Elizabeth Shaw emerges as our point-of-view character. She starts out as this sort of sweet, unprepossesing scientist willing to be coddled by her more adventurous scientist partner. In time, when it all turns to sh--, we see her channel the strength and awesome kickassery of Sigourney Weaver (although Rapace doesn't quite match Weaver's thunder). A deliciously creepy Michael Fassbender plays David, the android whose motivations seem mercurial and ever suspect. The excellent Idris Elba, as the laid back ship's captain, provides a dash of levity and a much needed human touch. And stepping in the shady Paul Reiser \\"company man\\" role, Charlize Theron is so icy and impassive that debate immediately surfaces regarding her true nature. Is she or isn't she? What she is, is underused.<br /><br />I rate PROMETHEUS 3.5 out of 5 stars. The stuff I liked, I liked very much. But the flaws... aaaiiyeeee! Or is that perceived flaws? I'm a bit torn about something. I refer to Ridley Scott's measure of ambiguity and his reluctance to produce those big reveals, to provide an even more pronounced connective tissue to ALIEN. One thought is that he's holding out for a sequel, in which case I'm on board. There's something to be said for slow burn gratification. But other elements undermine the film. Bits of metaphysical exposition comeoff as heavyhanded. I hate that a sizable chunk of the narrative stems from the scientists' making so many poor choices. Personnel eschew proper protocol. They throw caution to the winds and discard their oxygen helmets. They abandon their observation posts for a quickie while other crewmen are stranded off the ship. They think menacing tentacles emerging from inky pools are cute and harmless. I won't even go into Guy Pearce's unconvincing old man make-up. These nitpicks wouldn't be as readily apparent were this film not a furtherance of the classic ALIEN mythology. You can probably brush them off on BATTLESHIP or the TRANSFORMERS sequels. But there's a level of intelligence attached to this franchise that is compromised here. So, to sum it up, PROMETHEUS is a dazzling, powerful visual feast and thought-provoking enough, and it does give you moments in which you make those instant connections. Its grand scope absolutely begs for a viewing in the movie theater (you can probably give the 3-D a pass). I wouldn't mind seeing the survivor(s) in a follow-up picture. I wish it were better.off as heavyhanded. I hate that a sizable chunk of the narrative stems from the scientists' making so many poor choices. Personnel eschew proper protocol.

B0000AQS0F|1.0|I got sucked in by the fact it was \\"sci-fi\\" and cheap, but it's not worth the $12 + shipping I paid for it used-- or for that matter, just the shipping.  Normally, I love sci-fi, but this goes to show that with bad enough writing, even sci-fi can be rendered completely inane.<br /><br />Ever since at least Star Wars, the idea of combining space ships with familiar stories has been there-- sword & sorcery, warfare, ancient mythology, etc.  It works when the familiar stories are handled by good writers.  The story is what carries it, whether or not it takes place in the past or future, or what the technology is.  This attempt to merge with westerns might have been good if the writing was up to par with any decent westerns, but it came up laughably short in that department.<br /><br />The pilot introduced the characters as you would expect, and already they were landing on alien planets where an ambush with bad guys on horseback was in store, where the three heroes handily win the day over impossible odds, all the good guys are crack shots and the bad guys can't hit the side of a barn.<br /><br />But when the second episode opens with a barroom fight scene where the main character is just acting totally stupid, and they get out of another impossible-odds old-west-style situation by pulling their spaceship up behind them from below the edge of a cliff was just too much (where have I seen that before?)-- I had to hit eject there and put it back up for sale on Amazon.<br /><br />No wonder it didn't even last a season, that should have been an important clue.  Anyone who thinks it has \\"cult status,\\" must either stand to gain on the profits of its sale, or is no more than about 12 years old.  Though come to think of it, I know some 12 year olds that can write better stories than this, so I may be a bit too charitable here.

0441020712|4.0|I'm an Alastair Reynolds fan, pre-ordered this book months prior to publication, read most everything he has written. Well, it is no \\"House of Suns\\"; definitely NOT one of his best. That said, Alastair can write, his character development is good & the plot reasonable fast paced, fast enough to lure you into forgetting that it does not make much sense. The hero & sister heroine go chasing off around the solar system in an entirely implausible \\"treasure hunt\\" following a train of obscure clues left by their deceased grandmother, the matriarch of a wealthy dynasty. Never mind that the clues, such as they are, could've easily been over looked thus breaking the chain and more to the point, susceptible to multiple interpretations, again easily breaking the chain. However, the hero/heroine get into interesting scrapes everywhere they go & Alastair's visions of the future are always fascinating, perhaps even thought provoking. Alastair creates several mysteries to keep the reader involved; most if not all are solved by the end tho not quite elegantly or dramatically as they were spun.
B005P58PZC|4.0|The second season of Nikita is everything people say. The production values, if that's what they are called, are equivalent to a blockbuster action movie. Whereas the first season begins with all the cliches, the second season explores more interesting story lines. Even the occasional hint of humor. If I had to fault season 2, the final episodes with the president just didn't cut it for me. The actor playing the president was too light weight and unconvincing given the gravity of the situation. Also, the guy who looks like Christopher Reeve is a little weak. But compared to most TV and movies, this is a very entertaining show. The demise of one bad guy in particular (won't give it away) was really impressive and quite artistic.
0345803485|4.0|I am so glad I did not read the reviews for this book until after I had completed it! My sister prompted me to read it and I chose to do one at a time so as not to waste money. It actually took me some time to get into the first book, partly because of the writing, as mentioned by other reviewers, and because of it being redundant. I am, however, very glad I hung in there!<br />My work life is very stressful and serious so I loved coming home to this story of these two characters getting to know one another.<br />Every book is a stretch, lets face it! That is why we read. To get lost in fantasy land. Especially romance novels. Of course it is absurd that Christian is everything he is, especially given where he came from, but so what! That is why I loved him. I easily got past the biting lips and \\"crimson\\" cheeks repeatedly mentioned because I so loved how the relationship grew and how this hurt boy was saved by a female character that held her own very well.<br />Of course it is ridiculous that she had so many orgasms, though perhaps there are some women out there who manage to do so with the right partner, I am certain they are few and far between.<br /><br />I highly recommend this if you just want an enjoyable love story with a happy ending and enjoyable erotica throughout that can spice up your own bedroom.<br />This is not for anyone looking for an intellectual read, but who would read a romance novel for that? It is important to forge ahead with book one. I like book two and three better and am starting them again and I rarely re-read books, mostly due to time constraints. I just have not yet had enough of Ana and Christian.
B005LAIGN2|1.0|The Tuskegee Airmen is one of the great inspirational stories of WWII.  The fact that these men sacrificed a great deal and overcame much more is a story worth telling.  Red Tails fails to do this in spectacular fashion.  It's obvious they wanted to tell this story but were either too cheap or didn't have the respect to use the common names so we were stuck with Red Tails.  The characters are stock movie fashion, the solemn leader, the hot shot, the joker and the rookie. It's obvious that no research was really done and the dialog is laughable at best.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and stay away from this movie.  It does no credit to the story of the brave airmen and combines the worst quality of script and shooting.  Don't waste your time here.
B007N85ZXY|1.0|I go way back with Neil Young, and have been faithful through the dry times. But this new, or should I say old, recording just plain sucks.<br />I saw Neil at Madison Square Garden a couple years ago, and I was concerned. Wilco opened the show and frankly, they were so much more inspired and entertaining than Neil. I went away thinking \\"Neil is getting old\\" and I wondered if I would ever hear anything truly inspired from him again. Americana seems to answer that question with a resounding NO.<br />It's not just his age. Bob Dylan is in his 70s, and his last four releases are inspired and worth the honor of his name on the cover.<br />This cd is just plain awful. I'm not sure Neil will ever get his groove back. But I can still pull out Tonight's the Night, or even Prairie Wind, and remember how he was able at one time to be truly inspired.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|A lot of \\"old-time\\" rock acts have been releasing new albums lately, but they mostly disappoint. Not here. The Beach Boys have re-captured the spirit of the good time rock and roll they were famous for in the '60s. Sure, it's not breaking any new ground musically, but do you really want the Beach Boys to be anything new? The tempos are a bit slower, but the hooks and the harmonies are still right on target.<br />It is a pleasure to listen to, and it's nice to have another helping of their talent.<br /><br />God Bless the Beach Boys!
B0077ATSSQ|4.0|This movie deals with the terrible aftermath of the world trade center attacks, sparing no emotion, as a broken family struggles to live on without their father, husband and son. I waited a long time before reading the novel and watching this movie, because it was just too painful for me earlier. In the movie I expected emotional manipulation and political polemics, since those are so common in modern movies, but instead I found an honest, realistic, sad and hopeful journey into the heart of a family and into a great city. The acting was superb and the cinematography outstanding. There are areas where the story idealizes some things, but the overall effect was a moving and fitting tribute to life after tremendous loss.<br /><br />The novel provided much more detail about the characters, their background, and their reasons for living as they do, but the movie could not possibly capture all of that. You get enough information to understand and empathize, without bogging down in exposition. There are slow moments, but this is not a slow movie. Thomas Horne is magnificent as Oscar, the nine year old protagonist, and Max von Sydow is particularly effective as the silent old man who forms a bond with Oscar. His story is told in the briefest outline, but his presence is enormous, as a man who suffered tremendous loss long before 9-11. And yet we go on. Highly recommended.
B003BW0CB6|3.0|In a bit of a reversal, The Reversal emphasizes the slow, steady movement of the justice system.  Where other Connelly books are full of action and suspense, this one is more like an episode of Perry Mason.  Good use is made of Harry Bosch but one of his traits is his relentlessness and putting this at the end of the book leaves things up in the air.  I suspect this is the most true to life of Connelly's books but if life was that exciting we wouldn't be reading these stories.<br /><br />The other Lincoln Lawyer books are better, I think, and the Harry Bosch books are better still.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|The other reviewers said all the good stuff already. This book is a pleasant surprise: Well written, interesting character development, great plot and subplots with twists and turns. I want to read the sequel soon. PLEASE!
B0059WTMLW|1.0|not worth the hassle... even for free. the spyware does not uninstall. beware. open feint is bad news. all of my app and book icons turned grey.
B0059WTMLW|3.0|I'm always unimpressed with games that try to push Open Feint on us. I have yet to find a single person that uses or likes Open Feint and people complain about it constantly...yet devs keep putting this crap into their games. Why?<br /><br />Anyway, the game itself is okay. I like that it has different flavors of Sudoku, but the graphics are disappointing. One might ask how to make them better for a game like this. A few ideas might be to have the numbers look like raised 3D type images. Maybe have the tiles look like actual tiles that flip to your number when you select a box (like when what's her name flips a tile on Wheel of Fortune). Something to jazz it up a little. Maybe throw in a little character that climbs out of the corner to cheer when you fill a square. I guess what I'm saying is anything to set it apart from the multitude of other sudoku games out there.<br /><br />So, one star off for Open Feint, and one off for going with the standard graphics that are so unimpressive.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is so fun. its a flying squirrel collecting nuts in the sky. there are all diff kinds of nuts and obstacles as u fly through the sky. it gives u goals, like collect 10 gold nuts without any.other nuts, for example. awesome! I got it for free but its def worth paying for. u won't regret it!
0740797719|5.0|My first step in purchasing \\"Color and Light: A Guide for the Realist Painter\\" was to check the reviews. The 5 star ones heaped it with praise, and I have found that they weren't exaggerated. It is obvious that Mr. Gurney takes his profession very seriously and has studied all the aspects of it in depth.  Each subject is covered clearly, briefly, but also completely with well chosen illustrations.<br />This book will stay on my bookshelf.
B007N31YH0|5.0|Simply one of the most entertaining films of all time, bar none, THE STING is one of those classics you pray no one ever decides to remake. How could they make it better? Paul Newman and Robert Redford at their very best - Robert Shaw in a wonderfully realized performance - a supporting cast including Ray Walston, Harold Gould, Eileen Brennan and Charles Durning - perfect production design and memorable music. As a writer, though, I'm always focused on the script, and this one is set up beautifully and plays out to everyone's satisfaction. It's funny, unexpected, full of rich characters and gives us a window into a wildly interesting world.<br /><br />I have an extra (personal) reason to love this film. A friend of mine had a bit part in it. He died (way too young) in 1984, and I sometimes watch THE STING just to see him again. (Yeah, we all have our reasons ...)<br /><br />I've never met anyone who didn't love THE STING. It's on almost everyone's top 10 favorite list - and with good reasons. A multiple Oscar winner (and did it ever deserve to be!), it's simply aces in all areas.<br /><br />Enjoy this and make sure everyone you know sees it. Truly, THE STING is the movie they invented movie popcorn for.
B004J4X73K|5.0|This is an excellent continuation of the Night Runner saga.  I can only hope that more will follow.  Alec and Seregrin along with their magician friend, Thero, continue to battle foes of the Queen and another evil as well that seems impossible to detect.

B007M45PMU|5.0|This is a great album that really gets back to the roots of rock. It's folksy feel is fresh. This is a great album in a list of great albums from 2012 that move away from the same sound we've been hearing for years in alternative rock.
B005LAIHSG|2.0|After seeing the trailers, I thought Snow White and the Huntsman would be an interesting film. Boy was I disappointed. I am actually quite shocked there are so many good reviews of this film. This may mean this review gets \\"unhelpful\\" by many of the committed. Worth the risk.<br /><br />First, the script is so bad you can't suspend belief and enter the world of the film. This is necessary to get any sort of attachment to any of the characters. It is so bad that Hemsworth's shining moment sparks, at best, a small emotional thought. With a better script, there wouldn't be a dry eye in the theater. Multiple characters die and it is like watching coworkers eat. Boring. The characters has less depth than the average cartoon character. And there is no real sense of peril for any of the characters at any time in the movie. Ho hum! At best I can call this an interesting twist on the Snow White story that falls flat.<br /><br />Second, I find it really hard to read reviews that have positive things to say about the acting. Christine Stewart is so bad, I found myself wishing she was a mime in her scenes. Charlize Theron, who has been given kudos for the role, is only good if you regard someone who can scream convincingly a good actor/actress. Hemsworth is more eye candy for the ladies in the film, but does win for the best acting in the film. Unfortunately, his moments are short in the script, so you don't get to see much of his acting. The rest of the characters are pretty much throw away.<br /><br />Third, the cinematography and editing are nauseating. Not only figuratively speaking, at times the use of camera trickery and fast cuts (to enhance the action?) almost make you want to vomit. Parts of the battle and chase scenes are shot using a badly implemented \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" camera trick that simply makes your eyes boggle. Private Ryan used the narrow slit trick to give the feeling you were watching something that felt unreal, while this film uses it in a way that makes you want to shut your eyes to stop the madness.<br /><br />With so much bad, I guess the fault falls on the director, Rupert Sanders. I hope his craft matures, as this film is awful.<br /><br />The worst thing about this film is it had so much potential. The idea of taking the Snow White story and twisting it with a queen who possessed so great a chip on her shoulders is quite fascinating. Handled by better scriptwriters, it would have been magnificent. Directed by someone who understood a bit more about subtlety, it would have possessed far more intrigue. This is extremely important when you already know the story. And the battle scenes could have done without the badly implemented \\"Private Ryan\\" type of \\"unreality\\". In fact, being a bit more subtle in camera work and proper \\"painting of the film canvas\\" would have made the ride far more enjoyable.<br /><br />Are there any shining moments? Certainly. It is interesting to see Ian McShane and Bob Hoskins as dwarfs. The CGI to accomplish this is far better than the hobbits in Lord of the Rings. And there are some nice battle scenes (when the camera trickery is not overused). The costuming is wonderful and the lighting is done very well. If the script held up the story better, you could appreciate the world more.
B0086700CM|4.0|My two year old bought $20 in game credits because we forgot to set the restrictions. Besides that, the game is fun and the comments when you fail are hilarious.
B0079J28NW|5.0|Cleanest, clearest version I've ever seen. Unlike the DVD releases the full frame has been used so there are no cut off heads! Hey Bulldog is in, love it or hate it.<br />The sound is uncanny in remastered DTS-HD Master. It sounds like, for the songs, the master session tapes were used because the clarity and seperation are amazing.<br /><br />Fun for all ages and if you haven't a copy of this movie yet this is the one copy to buy.
B004LUS390|4.0|This is a pretty nice program for painting and sketching on the go. I do have one suggestion for the developer, and that is to add an option for bigger canvas sizes. Other than that, it's a great program to use.

1933633867|3.0|It's a well written book and has many clever ideas. I think Graeber's theories have application for addressing problems with consumer debt and consumerism in general. There's another problem though - from the beginning it's clear that the text is building towards a general criticism of capitalism as it exists in the present day. For the most part, I trusted his expertise as an anthropologist when it came to the historical descriptions. There was clearly a ton of editorial thrown in, but I just figured it was legit. Unfortunately, at the end, upon revealing the grande commentary about modern capitalism that the reader is waiting for, he reveals an -obvious- lack of knowledge about economics as it's practiced now. Obvious, maybe not to someone who knows nothing about economics or who has perhaps taken a few introductory courses ... but to someone who knows a thing or two - yeah, it's obvious.<br /><br />You can't have an opinion on fractional reserve lending without at least mentioning ideas of liquidity. Also, you need to describe how fractional reserve lending actually works! Next, you can't claim capitalism \\"must constantly be growing\\" without giving some specifics about why that's true. Logistically. Then, there is an erroneous claim about manipulations of currency in the floating exchange rate system (Graeber, it's the Chinese who were altering the value of their currency - not us. This is not an acceptable oversight). Also, if you're going to discuss foreign exchange anyway, you should mention the idea of policy trillema - even if you don't agree with it (capital controls vs. monitary policy vs. stable currency). Then, there's the stuff about military spending. Simply incorrect factually. The largest portion of the federal budget is medicare and medicaid - c'mon dude. So, although I think this book is worth a read, these problems are a red flag.<br /><br />I did enjoy the book. I should restate that. But, the lacking in the end makes me question the contents inthe beginning. Was that erroneous also?
0385344228|5.0|Whenever people write that a book is a \\"page-turner,\\" or \\"you can't put it down,\\"  I usually think, \\"Yeah...right...we'll just see.\\"  I haven't found a book that captures me from the beginning and holds me to the end for a few years, and I read a lot.  I can finally say for the first time in a long time,\\"I could not put this book down!\\" I had to sometimes so I could eat, sleep, work, and just live.  But, I could not shake this book from my head the entire time I was reading it. One of the other reviewers said that \\"it dragged.\\"  Huh?  What book was he reading??  This book did not drag.  Someone even thought the characters were not well developed.  In my opinion they were very well developed, just not as likable as we wanted them to be.  How do we know how we would react as parents if we were in the situation the characters in this book find themselves?  Needless to say, I think this is one of the best crime and suspense books I have read in years, and I would suggest it to anyone who is looking for that type of book and wants to escape into another world for awhile this summer.  I had never heard of this author before, but I plan to check out his other books.  This one deserves every one of those five stars!
3836501899|1.0|I've had this book on my wish list for a few years now.  I am finally able to buy it and then I realized it is the German Edition.  Since I don't read German, I can't enjoy this book despite the awesome pictures it must contain.  Part of the greatness of any work is to be able to read it in one's own language.  If there is an English Edition available, I'd buy it in an instant and give it a full five star review.

B007L3BMGA|1.0|This was a very good story. However, the fact is that this was originally written as a fan-fic based on Stephanie Meyer's Twilight series. I cannot condone that the author is now getting money for work which originally had a disclaimer that she was receiving no money and that copyright infringement was not intended. She should have created her own stories: changing names is not changing enough to call it original work to me.

B0065GC0BA|5.0|'Me Before You' is a beautifully written, deceptively simple book. The characters - particularly the main pair - are superbly drawn, and I was hooked from the first chapter. After this it became truly unputdownable - something I haven't been able to say about many books in the recent past.  I cannot go into detail about the story without spoiling this wonderful story. In short, this is a romantic book without being sickly, emotional without being mawkish, a love story with a real heart. I will most definitely be reading more by Jojo Moyes.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Great read about a \\"Warrior\\" who did his duty for his country.  An honor to have men/women like this among us !!!!!

B006ZAZ31U|4.0|I read quite a bit of non-fiction and fiction about Navy SEALs, and Fearless belongs to the better class of non-fiction Navy SEAL tomes, along with Lone Survivor, and the Dick Couch books. I like reading about these men--and the women who love them--because I enjoy finding out what makes them tick. This book is better than the \\"Heart and the Fist\\" (for example) because the author actually seems to care about helping the reader understand and visualize the world of an elite commando.<br /><br />Fearless isn't for everybody.  Adam Brown and his family are quite religious, and about 25% of the book is dedicated to Adam's conversion to Christianity and his dedication to his religion.  However, neither Adam--nor Blehm--are particularly judgmental and political discussions are kept to a minimum here, which means that everybody can enjoy the story of this wonderful American hero.
B001TODCII|2.0|This movie is pretty mild after having seen Hostel and its horrid sequel. It is also a much better movie. I hated the gore in Hostel. Taken was much more serious. Unfortunately, despite the good message it could have had, it was full of too many impossible situations. But in any case, I am glad I didn't see any of these three movies before going to Europe on my own at the age of 22.<br /><br />The father (the former spy) is concerned about his daughter going to Paris. Understandable. He seemed a little over-protective. But he was totally balanced out by the mother who was completely unconcerned about anything and went so far as to help the daughter lie about her plans! \\"She just couldn't tell him the truth,\\" the poor girl. So museums aren't for everybody. Personally I find sculptures and ancient relics much more interesting than paintings. But I must ask: why would ANYONE travel to a foreign country just to pick up the first hot guy they see and follow a rock band around and go to parties and do other things they could just do at home? Oh yeah, ditzy teenagers.<br /><br />Well, lo and behold, the daughter gets kidnapped, just like the father feared. And she happened to be on the phone with her father at the time. How lucky that he could record the incident! The movie wasn't bad up until this point but shortly afterward all the unbelievable things started to happen. Suspension of disbelief is one thing. But the guy was a former spy, not Superman.<br /><br />*SPOILER ALERT*<br />The father goes to two different places where they are holding girls to turn into sex slaves. Naturally his daughter is not in either. He kills everyone he comes across and never gets one little scratch. Then he starts attacking everyone in his path just to get by them. He shoots this one guy's innocent wife just to get him to talk. He goes on this crazy car chase down the wrong side of the highway. Yeah, risk the lives of another innocent 50 people just to save one. Sorry, that's just wrong. Finally he finds his daughter. She wasn't at the other places because she was one of the special ones who was being sold to an individual buyer. Not just that, but they were \\"saving the best for last.\\" Gee, what are the odds? Why, exactly? Well, she's American, and speaks English and French. Come on, she wasn't even that pretty. I think he didn't find her until the third place he looked because they needed to make the movie longer. Anyway, they capture the father. But even with his hands tied up, he manages to kill another ten bad guys. Yep, a Superman. So a little more drama, and then they come home, and all of a sudden he has his arm in a cast, even though he killed like 60 people without ever getting a scratch. This could have been a much more interesting story, if only it had been better executed. Or if it had been a superhero movie.Finally he finds his daughter.

1584282584|5.0|I've been an advanced amateur since minoring in photography in college.  I've never made a penny off of a photography I've taken.<br /><br />I came to this book through Niel's website.  And, I'm happy I did.<br /><br />I read the book through, and within hours, my flash photography had become wonderful.  I hated using a flash for the last 20 years previously.  In one hour, I suddenly realized that I could use a flash to take gorgeous pictures, and also realized that I was now virtually unlimited in where and what conditions I now had available to shoot in.  Bringing artificial light with you in a small flash unit, and being able to take the same great pictures you take in bright daylight suddenly makes photography exciting and new to me again.  This book has rejuvenated my hobby and improved my photographs better than any book I've ever read or studied on the topic<br /><br />Better yet, I decided to pick up the book a second time and started skimming through it again.  I discovered yet MORE great tips that go beyond flash photography which I'd overlooked during my first read.  I'm ecstatic with my new-found SLR abilities and the results that this book has brought me.  I have gone through lots of photography books, but none of them have been so full of great info as this one.  It's not just for portraits, and it's not just for flash - it's a great photography manual.<br /><br />It's as if a professional photographer sat me down and said, \\"Look.  All those classes and workshops make SLR photography seem really complex and tough.  Let me tell you a few secrets.  It's really quite simple.\\"<br /><br />And it is.<br /><br />This book simplifies, and improves photography like no other.  I never would've expected that from a book about using a speed light.  I shunned flash units for years.  Now, I love 'em as much as my lenses.

B0060MYM7O|5.0|As yet the Bluray hasn't been offered: so the next best thing is to pre-order it. Which as of this moment I have done so. I didn't go hunting afar for a \\"better\\" price. I wanted the GOT2 to be on the way when it becomes available. I am wont to support something I have as yet not seen [and apart from those who make it, none of us have]. BUT what I HAVE seen is Season 2. In its own way,it is as strong as LOTR. GOT's the Series has so far exceeded any non-movie \\"big screen\\" type series I have ever seen. And at the young age of 59, it has been more than a few. The breadth, depth, realism, and scope of ALL the actors is simply amazing. You WANT to believe in a character: and in GOT1 & 2, you can freely do so. I will not read the books as there are too many spoilers [really??] and I so do NOT want to have any preconceived ideas or expectations other than a continuation of the superb directing, acting, costuming, scenery, and in general, everything. As another fan wrote above me, even the child acting is simply top drawer. The wolves even seem in tune with the directors wishes! Are there issues: of course, as some who have read the entire series pointed out the \\"license\\" related to relative ages of the characters and story lines [the marriage of a 13 year old common in our real not so distant past will not occur in this presentation. No loss there in fact, at all] and there are others I am sure when I do break down and eventualy buy/read the series I will recognize. But for the vast majority of people, HBO has hit a Home Run and pitched a No-Hitter. I fully agree with the senitment, and can recommend this series TO ADULTS without hesitation. There IS nudity and other adult behaviors/language, as the stories are mostly about the machinations and conniving of \\"Those Who Would Be King\\" and those who for whatever reason, help put him there. So, not for the immature. A great series so far and well worth the now-twenty hours of seasons 1 & 2 to watch. Enjoy. We all are waiting for Season 3 to regale us with all of the trickery and such.

Costello/E.John- enough with the re-releases of the same cds over and over.<br />Each time the artist/label will claim that 'this is the way it's suppose to sound'- so does that mean you've been selling poorly sounded cds over the past 20 years.<br />This cd is just another ripoff.<br />If u don't own it, then get this. The review is based on the labels constant re-releases of the same material over and over.<br />Don't bother.<br /><br />----The Album is one of the best ever but you can find it available in a better sounding and cheaper version on Amazon.

B001MEJY8W|4.0|Strange movie but it has it's moments.. Some were totally unexpected.. A feeling of relief when the misery ended for our heroine or was it because the movie was over? Brutal and bloody but worth a view to draw your own conclusions, you can only sit through it once then pass it on....
B00845PV16|2.0|there is no explanation for a sequel to something as hopeless as ghost rider I.  and i suppose there will be no real explanation for a sequel to ghost rider II either.  not a problem, as long as i am not drugged or tortured into watching it.

B005LAIGSM|2.0|This movie was a disappointment.  I make that declaration on the strength that Rachel McAdams can NOT be expected to carry an entire film.  I have truly enjoyed her performances in many films and noticed that she has an uncanny ability to allow her authenticity to bleed into a scene.  She actually made the plot of Wedding Crashers feasible and realistic, despite the rampant abuse of shock comedy.  When I saw the previews, I just knew that she was going to bring something palpable through the screen.  I was a bit confused as to the selection of Mr. Tatum as her leading actor, but I just ~knew~ that if she signed onto this project, it was going to be well worth it.  Unfortunately, there was not a healthy balance throughout the movie.  There was no real angst, confusion, or despair that seemed to emanate from Mr. Tatum.  It felt as if McAdams was performing opposite a really bad intern.  Furthermore, there seemed to be little support offered from the people represented in his side of the partnership.  I was not looking for a sequel to \\"The Notebook\\", but I was not looking for the prequel to \\"Magic Mike\\" either.  Honestly, I would advise you to SAVE your money, and if it is on your cable during a rainy weekend -- perhaps then.
B00772M1F6|5.0|Wow!  What an album.  I heard an interview on NPR and ordered the CD.  I played it first in the car and I was rockin' all the way to work!  Great rock and roll.  Reminscent of the 50's.  My wife and I are dancin' to the music now.  Jitterbugging in our living room.  If you like rock and roll you will like this CD-Signs and Signifiers.

0345803485|3.0|I was given 50 Shades by a student who said I deserved some distractions from grading essays. Some of my friends (and my 67-year-old mom!), had read the series and LOVED it. So, what the heck, I thought.<br /><br />At first, I was addicted. I had to will myself to put the books down so I could participate in my own life. I just had to find out how Christian became Christian and if he was going to be OK! I loved the battle between the subconscious and inner goddess.<br /><br />By the third book, however, I was thinking, \\"alright, already. Just cut to the chase.\\" Even though each sex scene varied the details, they became more annoying because they were detracting from the real story. They were meant to distract the characters from real life and were fun to read at first. At some point, the sex scenes seemed unnecessary and I found myself skimming them just to get past them.<br /><br />I think the biggest let down was the anti-climax (no pun here) after the ransom scene. There should not have been daylight between the ransom scene and Christian's revelations. It was annoying to read through long pages of noncontributory dialogue and sexual thoughts. It was past time to get to the revelations. The disclosure of the details about the bail seemed to be an afterthought on the part of the author.<br /><br />Worse still, the epilogue dragged. I didn't even read the sex scene.<br /><br />I think this would have spectacular if there were only two books. There is too much non-information in three.

B007OTZ654|5.0|By someone's request on a music board, I compared 5 songs from the [[ASIN:B001FSC0UY Emi Netherlands Ziggy SACD ]] 2.0 SACD layer vs the 40th CD & 3 songs from the CD Layer of the SACD also vs the 40th CD<br /><br />The SACD is better than I remembered.<br /><br />The 40th CD has got to be one of the absolute best sounding standard rock cd's ever issued by a USA major label.<br /><br />The SACD was played on a stock [[ASIN:B00817UWQ6 OPPO BDP-95]].<br /><br />The 40th CD & the cd layer of the SACD was played on a cd front end consisting of Esoteric P10->Illuminati digital cable->PS Audio SL3<br /><br />One thing I did intentionally was play it very loud. Unlike vinyl, 44/16 (& digital in general) tends to get shrieky & have the sound stage collapse at high volume. While being slightly louder than the SACD (subjectively, I didn't do waveforms or EAC), this cd was much better than average in that regard.<br /><br />The outcome: in full SACD mode (other than Hang on To Yourself) the SACD wins, mostly on depth & a sense of realism. Tonality is surprisingly close; in fact the cd as a whole is amazingly close as a whole to the SACD considering dsd has a HUGE advantage over straight 44/16.<br /><br />The one exception on the SACD is there is something not quite right with the master they used of Hang On To Yourself on both layers. It's got tape hiss that is absent on the 40th, & sounds bright & distorted; especially the cd layer which really sounds pretty bad. I noticed that in the Star/Hang On Segue, the two tracks were originally recorded very different tonally, & this is clear on all versions. I also noticed for the first time (surprisingly) that on the 2nd line of the first chorus of Star someone really gooses the volume control. As this happens on both masters, I suspect the original mix is to blame. It's too obvious of a volume jump for my liking<br /><br />So final results (note all of these except Hang On TY cd vs cd are by a small margin & ymmv depending on your gear & your ears):<br /><br />SACD 2.0 layer vs 40th cd: (on 2 different players):<br /><br />Five Years - SACD<br />Soul Love - SACD<br />Moonage Daydream - SACD<br />Star - SACD<br />Hang On To Yourself - 40th CD<br /><br />SACD CD layer VS 40th CD (both on my old Esoteric/PS Audio CD front end):<br /><br />Soul Love - SACD CD layer by a very small margin (I don't feel as certain in this as in the SACD vs cd; each edition seems to do some things better than the other)<br /><br />Star - SACD CD layer by a very small margin (I don't feel as certain in this as in the SACD vs cd; each edition seems to do some things better than the other)<br /><br />Hang On To Yourself - 40th cd by a large margin<br /><br />I am still very curious to hear the audio hi res dvd<br /><br />As far as SACD vs 40th cd; if you have a quality SACD player & already own the SACD no need to buy the cd except for the car &/or the superior master of Hang On To Yourself. If you have a cd player only or a cheap SACD player & have $10 to spend (or don't have $100 to spend on the out of print SACD), they both sound quite good in different ways.<br /><br />For the bonus trax, I definitely prefer the EMI 30th over the Ryko, which I no longer own & have always found to be wretched.<br /><br />I also hear NO phasing in the top end on either edition, which was (if memory serves & this one is a pretty strong memory) an issue with the old RCA cd.<br /><br />5 Stars for the music & as far as 44/16 goes, 5 stars for the sound quality.ear & your ears):<br /><br />SACD 2.0 layer vs 40th cd: (on 2 different players):<br /><br />Five Years - SACD<br />Soul Love - SACD<br />Moonage Daydream - SACD<br />Star - SACD<br />Hang On To Yourself - 40th CD<br /><br />SACD CD layer VS 40th CD (both on my old Esoteric/PS Audio CD front end):<br /><br />Soul Love - SACD CD layer by a very small margin (I don't feel as certain in this as in the SACD vs cd; each edition seems to do some things better than the other)<br /><br />Star - SACD CD layer by a very small margin (I don't feel as certain in this as in the SACD vs cd; each edition seems to do some things better than the other)<br /><br />Hang On To Yourself - 40th cd by a large margin<br /><br />I am still very curious to hear the audio hi res dvd<br /><br />As far as SACD vs 40th cd; if you have a quality SACD player & already own the SACD no need to buy the cd except for the car &/or the superior master of Hang On To Yourself.

0545265355|5.0|The books are awesome.  I have heard so much about this series and I was not disappointed when I read them.  I immediately gave them to my daughter upon finishing and she feels the same and is going to pass them on to her friends.
B005F9TQ0Q|4.0|Pretty good and underrated album.  I rate this a 4 out of 5 because I feel albums like Highway 61 and Blood on the Tracks are 5's.  Some good songs on this one.  One question, what is the difference between this normal priced CD and the one priced in the $30 range?  The more expensive option has \\"Original Recording Remastered\\" in the description, but both this and that were reissued in 2004.  Are they both remastered and for some reason only one has the word \\"remastered\\" in the description?  Without directly comparing it side by side to the expensive option, can't tell if it is \\"remasted\\" or not, but the sound sounds good to me.  The expensive one is off the Sony label and the normal priced one is off the SBME label (Sony BMG Music Entertainment).  Other than the price and those formalities, what is the difference?
075695195X|5.0|The Amulet of Samarkand is a childhood favorite of mine. It is a book filled with magic and monsters that leap off the page and a plot kept me spellbound from start to end. The world is well-crafted, the characters are witty and enchanting, and the pages don't feel bogged down with details. I first read this in middle school and immediately checked out the next books.<br /><br />Bartimaeus is witty and intelligent. He's the kind of djinni who will twist his master's wishes while granting them, unless he really likes him and he approves of the task. He is ancient, arrogant, powerful, and very sarcastic. I love his interactions with Nathaniel. From their first meeting, the two must rack their brains for ways to work around each other. Nathaniel is highly intelligent for his age. After being publicly humiliated by magician Simon Lovelace, Nathaniel connives a plot for revenge by summoning an ancient djinni to steal the Amulet of Samarkand, which is currently in Lovelace's possession.<br /><br />What starts as a plan of vengeance soon turns to into very real danger, for Nathaniel has gotten himself involved with dark plots that he could have imagined. Bartimaeus and Nathaniel must work together to stay alive and overthrow evil. This is brilliantly crafted story is filled with wit and suspense that will captivate readers of all ages.

B007RXC3A8|1.0|It feels like every review of any recent Sonata Arctica work begins with something like, \\"If you can get into the new style...\\"<br /><br />Well, I can't. And it's not because I'm simply dismissing it out of hand because it's not classic power metal. No, I think you can call it whatever you want to call it, but it's still just not going to be very good. I understand not wanting to pigeon hole a band and restricting their creativity and growth and all the rest of that I-used-to-love-them-and-now-I'm-in-denial-and-making-up-excuses-for-them stuff you always hear in discussions such as these. But again, that's not what I'm suggesting at all. Their power metal was good and their...whatever you want to call anything in the Unia era (I'll call it pretentious garbage) was not.<br /><br />There are times on the album where it almost starts to get good, but then some out of place sound or ludicrous guitar riff will pop up and bring it to a screeching halt. It's almost as if there's some kind of built in alarm system that goes off whenever they start to approach decency.<br /><br />I'm sorry, but this is a 1-star from me regardless of whatever genre you want to place it in.

0312641893|5.0|This is the best story with a fairy-tale touch that I've ever read. I love books with action and mystery, and Cinder has it all. The poor, mistreated girl. The threat of intergalactic war. The hot prince. And a Lunar princess, killed by her aunt in a power struggle.<br /><br />Cinder is a resourceful girl. People who know what she is--a cyborg--detest her, believing her to be less than human. Cinder's stepmother never wanted the orphan cyborg that her husband picked up, and she uses Cinder to bring in the income and take care of menial chores around the house. Even so, Cinder never stops believing that there's a way out, and her strength of heart is inspiring. I also love her faithful android Iko, who has to be one of my most favorite side characters ever with its quirky, lovable personality. I even grew to love Prince Kai and enjoyed reading the scenes told from his perspective. Looking at the world through his eyes was eye opening and gives insight into the fragile relationship between humans and Lunars.<br /><br />The phenomenal world building is just another reason why I love this story, especially with how the story takes place in New Beijing. How cool is it that this is not only a story about a cyborg Cinderella but that it takes place in Asia? I appreciate how Meyer takes the time to paint a picture of the world. I could easily envision the setting with its mixture of a remembrance of older times and futuristic innovations.<br /><br />Prince Kai's arrival into Cinder's life and her stepsister's illness mark the turning point in Cinder's life. She finds herself reluctantly drawn to the prince even as secrets come to light and she learns more about her identity. When new revelations come to her, Cinder must decide what means more to her. Freedom or love. Marissa Meyer has crafted a world that has suffered greatly at its own hands and which now faces the greater threat of a powerful Lunar queen. As the plot progresses, the stakes keep climbing, as the secrets keep unfurling. I loved every moment of this book and highly anticipate the release of the sequel!ep unfurling. I loved every moment of this book and highly anticipate the release of the sequel!
B007AJFSJW|5.0|If I had my way, every policymaker in the United States would be required to read this book and summarize Krugman's arguments. It's a book that explains important facts about the economy we find ourselves in, and it does so in a way that even a poor, economically-illiterate history major like me can understand. So if you want an understandable, well-reasoned book about the Great Recession, buy this book now.
B004SIIBGU|2.0|At one point I thought that the android eBay app was better then the iPhone version but then lately they did an update and instead of better they took 3 steps backwards. Now the eBay app is almost like the mobile web page, if i wanted it to look like the mobile web page I would use my browser. A lot of options disappeared and others got worse like tracking packages. I just hope they either massively change the app or go back to the old version.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I enjoyed every moment of this book. you feel so much emotions reading it  anger, jealousy, happy, and best of all, love. you have to read this book with an open mind. violent? yes but thats what makes the story a beatiful disaster. travis maddox is someone you hate that you love him. read and just enjoy it for what it is.

B005LAIHY0|5.0|I was blown away! I couldn't believe it exceeded my expectations. The characters were great the development of the characters was great, the story was intriguing, and the visuals were amazing. Whats not to like? I'm sure we all have our opinions and what not but honestly I can't think of a sci-fi film that lived up to what Prometheus did. The scale of Prometheus was epic, yet it still gave us good performances and a good story, rather then being all style no substance. Which is funny because some people have argued that Prometheus is indeed style with no substance.......I guess I watched a different movie....

0547572298|2.0|There are people with paranormal abilities and other people who can negate the effects of the paranormals.  In a land where you can continue to talk with your loved ones after death, how will you know if you are really dead or if a paranormal is just messing with your reality?  Throw in Ubik, which appears to be a metaphor for God, and Jory, who appears to be a metaphor for the devil, you end up with a metaphoric and symbolic mess.<br /><br />The story was written in 1969.  We have appliances and doors that demand money to function.  They appear to be almost sentient as they demand coins be placed in their slots.  What happens to the coins?  Don't know.  Why are they demanded?  Don't know.  A lot was left out of the story, and honestly, this portion of the story is greatly affected by the story being 43 years old.  Also, the future in this story is 20 years in the past.  A letter from the editor would have been helpful in setting context.<br /><br />The character development was lacking.  I don't know the characters, and I totally missed any emotions between Wendy Wright and Joe.  If the author hadn't explained their great love, we wouldn't have known about it, because they sure didn't act in love.<br /><br />Spoilers********<br />The Pat Conley misdirection story line was tedious.  After the author painted Pat as the evil special of the day, we find out it was Jory, the dead kid at the moratorium who was just messing with the other dead people.  If it had been exciting, I would been on it like a dieter on chocolate, but it was boring.<br /><br />Then we end the story with maybe the living guy was also actually dead.  Which brings us to the ultimate thought that Ubik was actually mentioned at the beginning of the story, the  whole story could have been false.<br />Spoiler over*****<br /><br />I was just left unsatisfied.  I GOT all the story had to offer, and I found it to be meaningless, out of date, and a misuse of my time.<br /><br />I label this as a mediocre story with too many undeveloped themes that suffers from old age.
B0083GQ2A0|5.0|I enjoyed \\"The Grey\\" and found it to be a survival movie like \\"Alive.\\" Without giving away any of the plot, you basically are watching people deal with horrible circumstances. I would recommend this movie, but be aware that it's nothing like \\"Taken.\\"

B0079XPUOW|4.0|Andy Dahl is a bright and shiny ensign who has just been assigned to the Intrepid.  Quite quickly, he and his band of other ensigns (also bright and shiny) figure out that something odd is going on.  Away missions from the Intrepid have an unusually high casualty rate.  Death is more than likely for anyone who goes on these missions with the exception of five senior officers.  Dahl and his crew want to know why and they want it to stop!<br /><br />This was a quick read and fairly well done.  The end of the novel came too quickly and it was a fun ride.  Scalzi is sneaky though and while you are chuckling your way through this send-up of hack writing, bad sci-fi tropes and other misadventures, he makes you think.  All in all, a good read.
B0059WTMLW|5.0|Sudoku! What more do you want? It will occupy your time and keep you happy. Ask more and you won't get it.
B000HEVZ6W|5.0|No movie that I've seen in the last quarter century haunts me quite like Gattaca. I love this movie to the point where it actually brings me to tears just by thinking about it sometimes. Out of curiosity, I had to check out the 1- and 2-star reviews.<br /><br />The details of the plot have been well-covered by other reviews, so I won't go into that here. There is a consistent theme I see in the reviews: people who rate Gattaca low are focused on the discriminatory society portrayed in the film. People who rate Gattaca high are more interested in how Vincent busts his ass to fight for the life he wants to lead in spite of that society.<br /><br />I'm solidly in the second camp. This movie is about making your own life. This movie is about never giving up. This movie is about sacrificing and working hard for what matters to you. This is a movie about how expectations can be wrong, about how we're more than our genes, about entitlement and despair, about how you'll take that one chance in a thousand when it's your dream on the line. This is what the 5-star reviewers see in the film. The 1-stars just see it as a film about discrimination and get bored.
B007U1FEJE|3.0|This is an album that is mainly for fans of nostalgia. I personally cannot get excited about Brian and company (guys in their 60's and early 70's) singing about cruisin', going steady, dancing the night away (etc). This sort of lyrical content is just lazy and is far from believable. The guys fare better musically, though far too many moments are just retreads of the type of melody that Jimmy Buffett specializes in. The songs that work best are the three that close the album. With this melancholy mini-suite, the album finally reaches a point of some lyrical depth and musical sophistication. From what I've been reading, these three tracks are not even new. They apparently date back to 1998. Brian still had it then, but on the newer stuff Brian and his collaborators don't really seem to be trying. Perhaps if The Beach Boys had spent more time putting the album together--maybe even brought in Van Dyke Parks for assistance with the lyrics--the end result would have been something closer to \\"wonderful\\" instead of just \\"it's okay\\".

0399159029|5.0|I like these books.  I like police detective books in general but this one has a very interesting twist.  It is set during WWII in Nazi Germany.  Our detective was a policeman before the Nazis and WWII in Berlin and now he is stuck working for them.  Everything is upside down in Berlin because the priorities are all towards satisfying Hitler and the war effort.  So if a murder comes along which really doesn't advance his aims, it is given no priority.  In fact, a Dutch rail worker is murdered in Berlin and this murder is shoved aside by Bernie's superiors because of the far more important task of sewing yellow Js on Jews' clothing.<br /><br />There is an interesting way he opens this book.  It is 1942 and Bernie's superior is dead and he is overjoyed.  The Americans are also in the War.  In the very next chapter we jump back to 1941 where his detested superior is very much alive and the Americans are not in the war. Bernie had just returned from Prague in the 1942 opening so we know where we are going to end up.<br /><br />If you like this kind of twist, and these books are chock full of details about Nazi Germany and the war, then you should love these books.  I recommend them as a series and this one as a fine volume in it.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B007XKEY6Q|5.0|the notifications don't work on the kindle fire ... other than that this game is awesome ......... love it. lol
0767903862|3.0|3.5 stars. It took me five years to complete this book. I started listening to it as a CD, then bought the book, misplaced the book, moved, found the book again and remembered vaguely that I wanted to finish it. Started reading again, put it aside, picked it up again....and.... thus was my experience with this book. It wasn't BAD; it was just that some parts weren't necessarily gripping. And it was at those points that I would put it aside. Some of it was funny; some of it struck me as condescending (which is what ultimately bothered me about the book).<br /><br />I like Bill Bryson's writing, however, and thought that his trek through Australia was a terribly intriguing subject. I felt as if I was there with him, and added some of the places he visited to my bucket list. I learned some things, although I may have forgotten many of them. There is a lot of history and information in this book. A LOT of information.<br /><br />If you have any interest in Australia, or have ever fancied yourself the type who would like to explore it, you must read this book to contemplate the vastness of this continent.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|This movie was amazing in my opinion! Don't listen to the critics who aren't qualified to tell us what movies to like and nitpickers, who are never satisfied. I thought the film was visually stunning, had a great story and action packed. Also, more importantly the film did answer some of the lingering questions many of us fans had as to the origins of the creature we know as the Alien, it's purpose and the Engineers. Yes, It did also leave some questions, which are already fueling interesting theories online, but that's also part of the magic of story writing for such a well known and loved franchise. The director Ridley Scott said that he's already planning a sequel, so will most likely we'll have to wait in anticipation for some of those questions to get answered, but that's o.k. in my opinion. Well done Ridley Scott and Damon L.! This is a must see for Alien fans and Sci-Fi fans.
B0000DYKET|5.0|Once I got over the ugliness of these sandals (I had a pair of Keen Bike shoes so I knew how good they were) and let myself wear them, I was very happy I did.<br /><br />I have been entrusting my back and knees to MBT's for the past 4 years or so ([[ASIN:B001OQBV6Q MBT Women's Kisumu Sandal]], I realized that over time these were causing more pain to the sacral pain and sacral dysfunction I have.  I have had several pair of MBT shoes and at $200+ a pair, it has been difficult to give up on them and realize that they cause more pain for me these days in my lower back.  I needed a change of pace.<br /><br />I have to say that some of the arch and insole features that other people mention (like the ridge that hits behind the toes) have been no problem for me and have actually helped.  In order to avoid the potential \\"smell\\" that some people have complained of, I bought [[ASIN:B003WPPC3K 2 Toms Stink-Free Deodorizer Spray - 8 oz.]] to use beforehand to try to avoid any bacterial build-up that might contribute to any unwanted odors.<br /><br />After researching and researching some more, I discovered that people with back or foot problems like me (Morton's Neuroma) and lumbar/sacral and knee problems just need solid shoes with a good arch and a wide enough toebox.  Odd as they look at first, I found myself quickly amenable to them when I realized that they were actually supporting my knees and back and I could climb multiple steps of stairs and make my way around without a lot of pain ... that was pretty fantastic to me.  Just one thing about me, I have MS, so the walking I do is usually a little stiffer and more prone to pain.  If I can discover and adjunct shoe like Keen to make it a bit easier, I am a happy camper.<br /><br />5 Stars for Keen.<br /><br />Also, since I've read they can get a little ripe and smelly, I decided to pick up a bottle of Tom's [[ASIN:B003WPPC3K 2 Toms Stink-Free Deodorizer Spray - 8 oz.]].<br /><br />I worn them for about a week, comfy right out the box.  Recommend them!out the box.  Recommend them!
B002WJI63A|5.0|Couldn't be more satisfied.  My 5 yr old son has begged for Princess Peach to add to his Mario family collection.  Now, we are so happy.  She is a beautiful little plush and looks just like the one in the video games.  I like her hair.  She is well made.  So far pretty durable.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I find this app for the Bible very good. You can choose the version and the print. It allows you to highlite and take notes.I have a paper version but it weighs a ton and isn't easy to use. This is just wonderful you can put this on voice and listen . Please try it you will enjoy it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I quite enjoyed the characters in this series. I had never seen it before and regret its cancellation. I ordered the movie Serenity too and enjoyed it as well.
B0063GORYU|5.0|yeah baby!  This game is definitely addictive!  For solitaire lovers it provides a fun challenge and a break from ordinary games. I have already spent many happy hours with it!
1250000971|4.0|\\"Sins\\" is the second in what is to be at least a three-book saga (possibly more) entitled the Clifton Chronicles, centered around the character Harry Clifton. As with the first entry, \\"Only Time Will Tell\\", it was difficult to put down this engaging story, although at times we had forgotten key facts from book one - perhaps a brief reminder synopsis might have been nice. Archer again spun the tale little by little from different character's points of view, and it seemed Harry's sweetheart Emma and best friend Giles got a little more ink this time as Harry spent much of his time in prison. The question of who for sure is actually Harry's father continues to loom and dominates the latter part of the book as it makes a huge difference who inherits the title and estate of the Barrington family. Even without the maddening cliffhanger, we will be near the head of the line for book three of this terrific set!
B00846TTDG|5.0|From the time this movie started to the end, this movie had your attention. The team camaraderie to the actual fight scenes, it was amazing. I wasn't looking for the acting, I was lookin at the action and holy moly was it good. To find out that they used actual SEAL's for the scenes made it all the better. I give it a 5/5 because it is such a good movie. Got to be honest, was not expecting to cry at the end but it was heartbreaking to see that a father will never get to know his son.. or that his son will never get to see his father. This hits home because so many families today experience this today, and I hope that I never have to, as my brother is active duty.<br /><br />Props to everyone, this movie is fantastic.<br /><br />To all who serve no matter WHAT branch: THANK YOU! Past AND Present..Gone but NEVER Forgotten.<br /><br />&lt;3

B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Who created us?<br /><br />That is perhaps one of the greatest questions ever asked by mankind and is the driving idea at the center of Ridley Scott's new science-fiction adventure Prometheus, the first entry of a proposed trilogy from the celebrated British director who brought us ALIEN, and Blade Runner. This story detailing a possible origin of mankind follows journey of a research team traveling in a spaceship years away from home in search of their creators. Prometheus is a fantastic looking movie set in the same fictional universe as Ridley Scott's sci-fi/horror classic ALIEN (1979) and uses the mythology suggested by Dan O'Bannon's original script to fashion an entirely new sci-fi adventure.<br /><br />Prometheus is the name of a trillion dollar research vessel created by Weyland Industries. A science team along with an assorted group of professionals has been recruited to find a planet that has been depicted in numerous cave paintings back on earth. Dr Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace, Sweden's original Girl with the Dragon Tattoo [2009]) , and her lover Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshal Green) leads the science team under the critical, cold gaze of Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron). It takes over two years for the Prometheus to reach LV-223, during which the human crew is watched over by David 8 (Michael Fassbender), a highly advanced robotic organism programmed to simulate human life. Once they arrive on LV-223 they discover a structure left behind by the previous inhabitants. There Shaw and her science team searches for the key to mankind's creation, but instead finds a weapon with the potential of destroying all life on Earth.<br /><br />The break out character of the movie is Michael Fassbender as David 8. We meet David going about his daily routines while the rest of the crew is asleep in one of the best scenes the movie offers in ways of character development. David eats, watches over the crew, plays basketball by himself, learns new languages, and memorizes lines from his favorite movie, Lawrence of Arabia. Here's how I'd descrive this character: Imagine if HAL9000 from 2001: A Space Odyssey could take human form; if you could see him actually grappling and occasionally hinting at signs of having developed genuine emotions. That is David 8.<br /><br />As Elizabeth Shaw Noomi Rapace's first leading role in an English-language movie begins shaky, but by the end of the movie she's hit her stride, bringing Elizabeth Shaw to life. Her performance lacks the subtle nuance of her portrayal of Lisbeth Salander in the original Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, but it does pack a punch. By the end of the film she does firmly step into her action heroine shoes.<br /><br />A character I liked that not many people talk about as much is the Prometheus's Captain Janek, an underutilized character who had more potential than the movie allowed him. He starts off as an outsider to the worlds of Shaw, Vickers ,and the expedition, but by the end has completely devoted himself to it.<br /><br />Ridley Scott's stylish direction played a huge part in cementing ALIEN and Blade Runner as two of the movie world's science-fiction masterpieces and there is no doubt that Prometheus is a great looking movie. When Ridley Scott does science-fiction he knows how to make it look right, and that still holds true thirty years after Blade Runner. The full-scale sets are fantastic, there are plenty of great special effects. You shouldn't wait to see this movie on your home television: it needs to be seen on a big screen.<br /><br />That brings me to 3D. I saw this movie in IMAX 3D, and it is one of the best movies I've seen in 3D...That being said I still fail to see why on earth anyone cares about 3D. I've given Coraline, Avatar, TRON: Legacy, Hugo, and Prometheus a fair chance to dazzle me with this recent development in price raising- I mean exciting technology. These are some of the best movies to see 3D in, and yes they look good, but all of them I've also enjoyed just as much, if not better in 2D. If you really are obsessed with 3D then yes, knock yourself out, you're going to have a blast. But, if you're like me and still aren't sold on 3D this movie will not be an eye opener.<br /><br />The most important thing one needs to understand before sitting down for Ridley Scott's Prometheus: this is NOT an Alien movie. It takes place in the same universe as Alien, has visual elements of Alien, has locations and even the fledgling evolutionary stage of what will become the monsters of the 1979 classic, but alone Prometheus is not a straight-up ALIEN prequel. Prometheus is a standalone science-fiction adventure, and it is one that in my humble opinion works extraordinarily well. Ridley Scott announced he intends Prometheus to be the first part of a science-fiction trilogy set within the Alien universe. That means you should expect H.R. Giger's infamous monsters to be leaping around. This movie is about the creation of man, with the creation of what ultimately becomes the xenomorphs by the time the Nostromo arrives at LV-426 in the first Alien movie.<br /><br />Do not go into Prometheus expecting a direct ALIEN prequel.<br /><br />I feel I need to clarify that Prometheus is not an Alien movie because too many disappointed, annoyed, or downright angered reviewers are coming down hard on Prometheus for not filling the shows, or delivering the same goods of Ridley Scott's 1979 classic. To go in expecting another Alien movie would be to set yourself up for disappointment. This is Prometheus, part 1 of a new science fiction trilogy. It is not Ridley Scott's ALIEN 2 Electric Boogaloo.<br /><br />At times Prometheus is a bit in over its head with the scope of its ambition, but at the same time I love this idea of searching for a possible extra-terrestrial root to man's DNA. Sure, the plot has been done several times in books, but only a few times in movies, and I honestly feel Prometheus has done a better job of it than does other films.<br /><br />Prometheus isn't ALIEN but it is a damn good first step for what could be a great new series. For what it's worth: I loved Prometheus. Even with its flaws.<br /><br />Here's to the hopes of a brilliant trilogy from Sir Ridley Scott!o enjoyed just as much, if not better in 2D.

B000002MX7|5.0|There are some voices you hear or you have the great privilege seeing in performance, whose artistry really gets into your blood and brings you renewed feelings toward life, love and the situations we find ourselves in. Chaka Khan is one of those incomparable vocalists you will never forget, once you hear one of her tunes. I remember, when I was a little girl, how Whitney Houston brought about a revived interest in Chaka's impressive body of work by covering her hit song \\"I'm Every Woman\\" for THE BODYGUARD soundtrack, in the early 1990s. This was a well-deserve resurgence for Khan, who was lead vocalist for the band Rufus.<br /><br />Born and bred in the South Side of Chicago, Yvette (her given name) was one of five siblings, who proved she had fierce talent at an early age. The way she purred her way through music with style, class and tasteful sexiness was incomparable to any young songbird coming up in the 1970s. Songs like \\"Tell Me Somethin' Good\\" (written by Stevie Wonder), later songs when she went solo - like \\"Ain't Nobody\\" and \\"Through the Fire\\" - show her sensitivity, her soul to the bone and her purity as an artist. When I hear this music, I often feel lifted, closer to a spiritual plane and in the company of a good friend. It is comforting and also makes you feel like you've got something to carry with pride, as a woman. I haven't found other artists who can transform their listeners in quite the same way. It's like being at a spiritual revival and a disco, at the same time. Good feelings, good vibes.
B007MNV5WU|3.0|I really want this game... but to much! On the apple app store its 99&cent;. Cant it be 99&cent; too!! I'm not paying for it until it goes down!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|i love this game. it helps me kill time at lunch and it keeps the kids bussy. the recent upgrades are awesome. i love scrat. wish they had more movies!
0547258305|5.0|i loved this book. the characteres are well developed, rich with detail, and very likeable. The plot is complex. It all comes together for a truly satisfying read that is next to impossible to put down. I hated it to end. The next book Fire very good too--wonderful imagery and great fun.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Ana is college English major about to graduate with no prior sexual experience when she interviews Christian Grey, a young rich businessman, for her college newspaper. It is a case of mutual love at first sight, but Mr. Grey wants Ana to become his submissive in a Dominant/submissive relationship. This is a good erotic romance novel that handles character development well, and provides a decent look into a kinky relationship for general audiences. The sexual encounters are somewhat idealized, but that is expected in the romance genre. This is the first of three volumes so don't expect a typical happily ever after romance ending to volume one.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|Overall, this is a really great cd.  I really enjoy the first half as it is mainly upbeat dance type songs, but the ballads are super as well.  I love Adam and think he is so talented. Unfortunately, I think he is very underrated.

1401201911|4.0|Is it possible to take our good intentions too far? Does forcing morality onto people create a better society, or just a better looking one?<br /><br />These are some of the questions tackled in Superman: Red Son. The first question it asks is, \\"What if Superman landed 12 hours later, ending up in Soviet Russia rather than Midwest, USA?\\" The Soviet Union exploits this fact, and with your belief structures largely based on what your parents believe and the culture you're raised in, Superman would come to believe in the Communist agenda.<br /><br />Inevitably, a belief in communism combined with Superman's morality and the death of Stalin pushes him to a point where he believes that if he was in charge of the Soviet Union, things would be better. And soon more and more of the world comes under his control. But not everything is peachy. Not everyone wants to sign up for the Superman plan of world domination, including the U.S., and a character who's appearance I don't want to spoil.<br /><br />In the process of telling this engaging story, it wrestles with the questions I listed at the beginning. Can you force morality onto people, and does that make for a better society? Does an alien or higher power have the right to interfere in the lives of humans, or are we better off on our own? These are the kinds of questions humanity has been asking itself for a long time. And while Red Son does it's best to answer those questions, I'm not sure all of it's implications are correct.<br /><br />Regardless, Superman looks pretty cool in a Soviet military inspired costume.

B006OCM0G0|1.0|DO NOT make any in-app purchases with this develolper for any of thier games.  I made a purchase for $7.99 and my account was not credited.  TeamLava support ignored my emails.  Don't waste your money.
B00004Z400|5.0|White Pony is arguably their best album to date and one of the best modern hard rock/metal albums. This is when their music gets more atmospheric, unique and more melodic although it's still somewhat heavy. It captures the best of the heavier, earlier Deftones and the later atmospheric, melodic Deftones. It includes their '00 hit Change (In The House Of Flies) which is probably their most popular song. The whole album's solid throughout and worth adding to your music collection.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so fun reccomend it for all ages but warning: VERY ADDICTING. whoever made this game is amazing.
B007PF7MGS|5.0|There are many doctors now touting the low/no fat vegan diet out there but none with conviction and power of Dr. McDougall. He is saving lives everyday!
B0077SGMXM|5.0|A very enjoyable and addictive game app.  The emphasis is on tee-to-green play because once you're on the green the putting is pretty much automatic (all putts are straight).  The app provides up to 7 mulligan shots per round and this is probably too generous.  I would recommend to all \\"gamers,\\" even non-golfers.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Been looking forever for something to organize my, sometimes, chaotic thoughts and sundry to-do lists and having access to them no matter what. Man, this does it and more, I found my tool! No more memo pads and discarded paper from thought reorganization ever again. Go green.

B0086700CM|5.0|OMG!!!!!! The real temple run has finnally come out! If you haven't played this game buy it and play it this game is awesome! Just look at the other 5 star reviews this game is awesome.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love love love this game. I am soooooooooooo addicted to it. It's like a new game every time you play.
B0015DROBO|5.0|At first I was a little skeptical about reading this book. I had no idea what it was about and when it was suggested to me I sort of just shrugged it off. Then when they were coming out with a movie for it I thought I'd better read it and I was definitely glad I did. I had a hard time putting it down the minute I started it. Salander had me captivated the whole time, her odd nature and the mystery the book is written about kept my interests at a high. I can't wait to indulge in the sequel and see what odd and unusual things captivate my attention this time.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|a lot of diversity with all the games! easy and fun to use! can play this for a long time.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is awesome! I play this game for hours on end. It's fun. It's cool. It's fun for all ages.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy ondone the eyes. One tap moves makes for quick games. I love it when I'm waiting for something, someone, or anything. Don't really need much of an excuse to play this. Thanks.
B007Z9RAX4|2.0|Downloaded this video because I missed it at the show. I'm glad I did not waste my 5.00. It was confusing throughout the whole movie. Yes, there were a lot of action scenes but it appears to me that the main character was always walking somewhere. Like I said the movie was confusing. But when you can't find anything to do outside of the house on a Saturday afternoon this could kill some time.
