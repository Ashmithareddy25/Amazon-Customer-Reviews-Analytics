B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing book!!!!! It's crazy how much is not in the movie. Can't wait to read the next book. Catching Fire here I come.
B000HAB4KS|5.0|No initial regrets... the movie played well... the cost was low... easy to purchase... I would do it again... I did want however, to go back and rewatch parts that I missed, but once the movie ended it would not let me go back.. VERY BUMMED about that.

B0016J81B4|5.0|These are the perfect clog for messy work. My partner is a butcher and has worn a pair of these to work everyday for the past 3 years. they are comfortable and easy to clean, exactly as described. After 2 or so years of daily use the sole had started to become worn so that the traction was not its best however, he has only needed a new pair very recently. They don't come in half sizes and I would recommend ordering a size up as they're actually supposed to fit with a bit of wiggle room. overall, awesome shoes for an amazing price.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|With that said, I have come across a fork in the road that may determine if I keep playing or just move on. My dilimma is that I really enjoyed this game so much that I have solved all the puzzles, gotten all the prizes over x9 (lowest is x10,  highest is x49), on level 236, and have over 22,000 coins. I seem to have no real need to collect anymore coins,  although I might just go to 30,000 for the fun of it, or to collect any prizes because the maximum needed seems to be just x9. My problem with this game is even though I have finished solving all the puzzles and have all the needed prides I can not get to the bonuses without paying money for the dozed bucks. I did get enough of them to open 2 bonuses,  but I have about 6 others I can not get to because I only have 1 free dozed buck left. If the programmers or anyone else has a genuine solution to my dilimma I would really appreciate it. Other wise I guesse it is time to move on.
B005FITIK0|5.0|I saw this film in the theatre when it came out and saw it again on tv the other night. I am struck by the dichotomy of Amazon's reviews and wonder how so many viewers could hold such opposite opinions. See for yourself: at this writing, 104 four and five stars, 85 one stars. I conclude this excellent character study of a narcissist steps on a lot of toes. Why else the near hatred reserved for this film? A few thoughtful reviewers did note a similarity between themselves and the Mavis character, so someone got something substantive, maybe even insightful, from it, unlike those who found it a `waste of my life'. Hmmm.<br />At any rate, Young Adult has many attributes: the acting by Charlize Theron and others is spot-on; scenes that may appear throw-away or uneventful to some reveal personality. One reviewer questioned the manicure scenes: but what normal woman would get two manicures in two days? No one. Only a self-obsessed, desperate woman would think changing the color of her nails is going to make someone else's  husband fall for her. She ignores or resents her only friend, a Pomeranian. She relates to a hotel clerk and others with gratuitous lying, mostly about how she came to be in town at all (\\"real estate thing\\"). Her contempt for others is palpable; and what about the self-contempt? Her slatternly lifestyle is on parade through her apartment, vehicle, diet, and wardrobe. It's as if she thinks her beauty is enough, but the truth is beginning to break through and make her miserable. And while there are `darkly comic' moments, this film is anything but a comedy. Observe the train wreck unfold.<br />Through minute chinks, the truth outs itself. Mavis flatly states to her clueless parents \\"I may be an alcoholic\\" and they brush it off.  After the excruciating scene on Buddy's front lawn, Mavis sees herself for what she is. Some reviewers say there's no point, no plot to this film. They're not paying attention. The denouement comes quietly, at Matt's kitchen tableduring a conversation between the newly-discerning Mavis and Matt's sister, who crushes Mavis' s revelation by assuring her that she's the same superior being she's always (never) been. The light recedes from Mavis's eyes and THAT is the point of the film. Redemption was offered and rejected. A soul spins into oblivion.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Already off to a wonderful start! Downtown never fails. You laugh, you cry & then your crying & laughing together. It's absolutely wonderful!
B000VLE3GA|5.0|Led Zeppelin Mother Ship is the most complete album to the band LED ZEPPELIN I' ve ever head, launched in 2007. Perhaps more complete than his last album '' CELEBRATION DAY'' released in 2012. It is a double album that comes packed with several successes.But songs included in this album that  I like best  were:ROCK and ROOL-BLACK DOG-KASHMIR-ALL MY LOVE-STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN. Stairway to Heaven is the band's sound that I hear mot throughout my youth,therefore is the song of band Led Zeppelin I like most.This album I bought it throughl (amazon.com),for those who like the Rock of 70's and the band Led Zeppelin in their old formation:-JOHN BONHAM:Drums-JOHN PAUL JONES:-Bass:-Jimmy Page: Lead Guitar:-Robert Plant:-Vocal,will like this double album. It's an excellent album and I recommend every one to buy it

B00000IZOR|3.0|I remember having one of these when I was little. Cute!<br />The only thing I dont like it the string that attaches the phone to the hand held part is super short.
B003WKOU0G|3.0|It is about bringing up a baby in 4 different cultures Africa, Tokyo, San Francisco, Mongolia, it is very interesting if you like culture differences.  It is surprising at how the poorest boy is taken care of by the other children and loved by the whole family.  Interesting at the attachment style from the Mongolian people and also the surprise association in the Tokyo and San Francisco babies.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|I have this game on my ipod touch and. computer. and now finally. my kindle fire. Very fun and addictive. with beautiful artwork.
B00597A6NU|5.0|What can you say about an icon?  Memphis Belle was the first B17 to complete all 25 missions with her crew.  Her last mission, was nearly her last, but she came through and eventually went on tour in the U.S. to sell War Bonds, along with her crew.  Reasonably accurate with great photography and air combat, this is a must see movie about our Greatest Generation and how young boys became men in the air.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|Was wrapped up in this story for most of it but towards the end it started to wane a bit as I found the premise just too unbelievable.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|Excellent. Just odd and quirky enough to make you  keep reading to find out what is going to happen next.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I really enjoy this game I just wish it was linked to my facebok account because I play it there
B0076DCT2G|5.0|John Corey books by DeMille have to best among the best fiction ever written.  The humor, personalities, technical detail, etc. are unequalled.  I just wish that it wasn't so long between books!!  Can't stop reading once you start.

1609611543|5.0|At 33 years old I was going on 60 with all my bad health symptoms. Most notably arthritis, fatigue, and showing pre diabetic symptoms. We thought it was my thyroid which gets blamed for everything these days. I was whining to my mom telling her I thought I was getting Rheumatoid Arthritis at 33, and even went to the Church for prayer. A month later this book found me, and I quit wheat immediately. All the health problems are gone and I have lost a little weight. If I even have a little bit of wheat my arthritis flares up.  It is tricky to eat out at Restaurants, and I do miss some of it. However it is so worth it!!!!!  Then I gave my sister the book who battles diabetes, stomach and heart problems and she has had lots of improvement! She is feeling much better! If the author is ever in the Park City area, dinner and lift tickets are on me!  Gluten free dinner that is! Thank you for giving me my life back. I love having my joints and bones back and pain free. Shame on this dirty GMO society and all the crap people are eating. Wake up!!!
B00AMS4H2M|5.0|I really love this CD. T. I. really took time out and rapped with passion. He spoke about his experience in jail and what he is going through in life currently. He is a great artist and spoke person.
B004Q7E0TA|5.0|This book took me away. It was really great. I thoroughly enjoyed it. And even though its long, you won't even feel it. Seems like i wanted to read more and more. Shipped quick and looked better than i expected.

B008CJ0JTI|5.0|Great fan of this director's movies including The girl with the Dragon Tattoo. This movie does not disappoint. Great video and Audio.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|\\"Les Miserables\\" with Hugh Jackman is not to be missed if you love music and great acting.  The bad reviews on this page may be by \\"theatre people,\\" who feel threatened by this cinematic masterpiece.  \\"Les Miserables\\" is both intimate and sweeping in its scope. The themes of redemption, equality and revolution are so large, that they surprisingly translate better on film than on a small stage. I loved the way the camera swept through the city scenes. In contrast, the camera is able to highlight through close-ups the emotion conveyed by the actors, something we often cannot see on stage.<br /><br />The performances by Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, Russell Crowe and others are simply remarkable.  I have seen the movie twice, something I rarely do. But there is SO much detail, that one can't take it all in during one sitting. But DO understand: this is an opera; there is very little dialogue. However, it is easy to follow. It is also long and it WILL get to you...so have some tissues in hand.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Great fan of this director's movies including Jaws, E.T., Shindler's List, etc.. This movie set does not disappoint. Great video and Audio.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I learned of the Piano Guys on YouTube and loved their videos.  I purchased the album so that I have their music wherever I go and can't watch their beautiful videos.  Check out their videos first before buying to see if you enjoy their style.  Great, fun uplifting music!

B004RL9T50|5.0|Have to say I was not sure about this movie, but after a few minutes of watching I knew it was worth renting.  This movie was funny, worth watching again for sure.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|Outstanding product.  Holds my camera, extra lenses, and accessories.  I have only two hiccups, both ow which concern the straps intended to go across the front of the body to hold the backpack in place (also a great security feature).  (1) The small cross-strap at the shoulder pads is too high;  On me, it rides up to my neck.  Totally unacceptable.  It should be mounted BELOW the shoulder pads.  I will try to find a way to have mine moved to that location; failing that, I'll not use that important strap.  (2) The large strap at the bottom of the backpack is TOO SHORT.  Not everyone has a 30-inch waist line.  The strap needs to be longer to accommodate those of us with portly figures.  The extra length also is needed to allow the strap to be secured over heavy (bulky) outer clothing such as worn in frigid weather.  I plan to put together an 'extension' strap to place between the existing connectors.  Otherwise, I'm impressed with the quality of the backpack.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This game is extremely addictive and fun. I can lose track of the time very easily playing it. well worth it.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|I could not put this book down!  It is an amazing true story.  It opened my eyes to the horrible hardships that the people of North Korea endure.  Everyone should read it because the world is just not aware.
B00AYB20KI|2.0|While the movie was halfway decent just because of the star actress, Jennifer Lawerence, making it worthwhile to watch, it didn't seem to make sense. Why would the sheriff go into the house with gun drawn without back-up or at least letting someone else know what he's doing? Why would the mother not see the sheriff's car and know something was majorly wrong before entering the house? What happened to the gun the girl had when she shot the murderer and then went for the keys and he grabed her? Also I guessed who the murderer was in the first 20 minutes--so no surprises there. While there was action and suspense it wasn't very believable. The writers should have thought through on the details more. The movie is entertaining because of Jennifer Lawerence. If your not into things having to make sense and would like a good scare, then you would probably really enjoy this film.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|i really like this game. i first had it on my smaller ipod touch, but with the kindle fire it takes it to a whole new level of fun!
B0083GQ2A0|5.0|I thought the film was very entertaining and the ending a big surprise. The characters were well developed before each one meets his end. It's definitely a man's movie, but does include romance and trajedy. When I read about this movie I wasn't sure it was something I really wanted to watch, but once I did I was totally taken in by the story. I would highly recommend it for adventure lovers or anyone just wanting to watch something with an unusual twist. The wolves, which I'm sure were digitally made, seemed a little large to me, but that only added to the suspense and fright of the story. Liam Neeson is an added plus to making the film entertaining.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|I think there should be a parental block that you can choose to turn on to not let bad things come through because you play with people you don't know.lots of fun other than that.

B0086700CM|4.0|I love this game! it is soooo adicting!  if you like this games than i suggest you get Subway Surfers.
B0087JTAKW|2.0|I read this book in a day, and while I did like the bones of the story, I didn't find it to be overly pragmatic or inspiring. The book is choppy, and switches from character to character haphazardly, which in my opinion, muddled up the story. I was not impressed with the quality of the plot. It seemed as if someone with no experience in writing decided to write a book. I found the characters to be unbelievable at best, with their circumstances being unrealistic. I felt it was beyond ridiculous that a man with that much money, would call an employee and have her research \\"immortality\\", as if she is going to produce some clue as to the whereabouts of the Fountain of Youth. I felt that by having him ask for \\"immortality\\" he was pandering to people who can't read very well, and are not capable of looking up \\"Cryonics\\". His female character is dismal and shallow. She is unhappy because her parents are divorced, she is overweight, and then is rejected by a boy - so now she wants to kill herself. Surely Mitch could have developed her into a character that I could have felt more pity for (and by that, I mean believed). In fact, the only character I remotely cared at all about was Dor. I failed to grasp why he was being punished (possibly because I am not a religious person, so the point was lost to me), and spent most of the time wishing Mitch would discuss Dor more. Overall, the book left much to be desired. The language was juvenile, and dull. I felt that Mitch tried, and failed, to make a powerful story about the amount of time that we are given. Had he spent more time developing this story, giving it some depth, it could have been great.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is increadibly fun! if you start playing it you will never be able to stop! best game ever buy it!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Had seen the Spider game but never downloaded until my daugther in law showed me the game on my grandsons i-pod and how to play........Love this game, play all the time, it thrills me to beat the cards.......worth downloading it and good luck......

B009IRVSVQ|5.0|It is an excellent album but do not let your kids listen unattended as it has some harsh language at times
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Love clean, classic movies. Historical & interesting. Appreciate good lauguage & real romance instead of sex scenes. Didn't want it to end; wanted more!
B0027MJU00|5.0|TThis is another great one by Gillian  Flynn !!she gas a way of keeping you guessing and craving more!!couldnt put it down !!
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Willis may be getting older, but he still knows how to wield his fists and his weaponry. The ending, however, was a foregone conclusion, despite the &#34;soul-searching&#34; by Mr. Gordon-Levitt. Some thought processes are required by the viewer to avoid confusion... overall, a worthwhile rental.
B002QVZ71I|5.0|Great move, we love it. It's my husbands favorite and we will continue to watch it over and over! thanks.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|it is the same thing as temple run and temple run brave,but the kid as the runner and the police as the chaser.
B008M721MS|3.0|I think that it should open right away than I can chat with all of the friends I know in real life
B009329ZF2|5.0|Even though the practicality or the likelihood of such an occurrence is slim it shows that even misfits can come forward and shine, then the special effects and actions taken by the mighty Mo as the last hope of mankind brings a smile and warmth to my heart because I remember the part she played in several wars and conflicts.  And of course she is still a sight to behold. It begs the question maybe it wasn't wise placing those magnificent ships in moth balls or turning them into museums.<br />Though long the movie was action packed and fast moving. I rented it for only 24 hrs. and managed to re-whatch it more times than I can remember.  Watch this movie it is well worth it!
B00846REIS|5.0|Is a must read....has you really wanting for more!!!  Defiantly one of those books that really sucks you in and you feel everything that they feel!! Like I said a must read and if u don't like it then whats wrong with you!! Lol

B0015DYIH2|5.0|I wasn't sure about whether or not I would like reading these books because I'm an adult but I loved the movies and so I thought that surely I would enjoy the books.  I was absolutely right!  I LOVED them even more than the movie because you really get inside Bella's head.  If you are debating on this like I was....BUY IT!
B009DP9D6A|4.0|This may be his best album yet. A lot of tracks are a departure from the normal deadmau5, which is a refreshing change. There's still enough of his trademarked sound in there to keep you interested, though. The Veldt is my favorite track.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is beautifully written, even if it is sometimes hard to follow. It takes you into the journey of a young boy's quest to find himself.
B0086700CM|5.0|Love this game hard to put it down. It gets harder when it gets so fast but I keep trying everybody says there is a cheat but earn it the honest way!!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is the best game ever.  Hours of fun and frustration.  This is one of the few games that I keep the sound on.  The sounds are funny and sweet.  The newer birds are funny, cute and challenging to get used to.  Some levels are easy and others are very difficult to solve.  I never get board with Angry Birds.

0316228532|2.0|Having read most of the HP books, I find J.K. Rowling to be one of the best (if not THE best) story-tellers of our time.  So I was excited when I bought \\"The Casual Vacancy.\\" I wanted so badly to like this book. But I didn't. In fact, I disliked it so much that I had to force myself to finish reading it.  Sorry Ms. Rowling--I still think you are an incredible talent--I just don't like this book.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Character development is unique.  It is unlike any novel that I have read.  It keeps the reader in suspense until the end.
0812982622|5.0|If you read a lot of books I'm sure you have experienced the feeling that certain books strike a note with you that others might not achieve because somehow the author has written something that has significant meaning and is totally entertaining. I hate to use the cliche \\" I couldn't put the book down\\" but I couldn't. The Orphan Master's Son for some reason, I'm not gifted enough to put it in eloquent words,  struck a nerve in me.  The nature of the book seems to me at least to be Orwellian but deals not with some supposed future theoretical totalitarian government, subjugating its populace, but with a real existing brutal autocracy which has so brainwashed and intimidated it's population, that there is no chance of any expression of freedom as we know it.  The plot is cleverly developed and  keeps you wondering where it will lead. Eventually through a clever use of two different narrators it comes to an inevitable conclusion. Although this is fiction, the author, I believe has truly captured the reality of North Korea today. Read it!!! You will be entertained and informed!!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|No Spoilers!<br />This book had the usual Nicholas Sparks male character you can't resist to love but lacked in the passion. At the last page, I went to turn the page and couldn't believe it was over. Good read for people who read a lot. Not a good investment in time for someone who is not a big reader
B004GHNIRK|4.0|The book is definitely 5 stars, but a few words are missing in this translation. The movie pales by comparison.
B000NY12LO|5.0|Could not put the book down! Reminds you that we all need to belong and be valued. And to take bullying seriously.
0316227706|5.0|This is one if the best books money can buy. I find myself looking at it every single day. The photos are flawless and you can really see the personality of each sweet dog clearly.
B005IQZB14|5.0|This is one of those very engrossing books where you end up really empathizing with the character. I would read it on the subway and almost think I was up there in the PCT with her by the time I looked up from the book. Engrossing and relateable.
B0097PW7H8|3.0|I'm not sure why but shortly after I downloaded this app I charged it one night and the next morning it was completely dead. I'm not saying it was the app but it just didn't make since considering my kindle is brand spanking new.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|I am a huge fan of Mitch Albom.  This book kept me intrigued and alert until the very last page.  I recommend it as a good quick airplane read.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I am grateful that E L James included Christian's POV at the end of the story. It's what made the book. As a matter of fact, I reread the entire trilogy with Christian's perspective in mind because of the last chapter. The books were much more interesting the second time around. The rest of the book is almost exhausting with tragedy after tragedy happening to Ana. It made her almost appear to be a superhero rather than a young woman in love. With that said, the tragedies were very well played out.

B004UJTG6Q|4.0|I remember reading this in high school. Even though to me I hated English this and a few other books I was interested in. This book reminds me so much of my family history and my home town. I am a cajun and this was a book close to home on many levels.

B0063IH60K|1.0|This looked and sounded like a great version of Solitaire so I downloaded it and installed it.  Setup went smoothly, with lots of interesting options for card backs, etc.  I was very much looking forward to playing my first game so I clicked the \\"play\\" icon and sat and watched it deal... then the screen cleared and an advertisement for a gay dating web site popped up with pictures of guys asking if I was single.  Ummm, sorry, no.  Hetero and married, but thanks for asking.  Tried to bypass the ad and the screen was completely locked.  Nothing worked but force closing the app.  Not exactly what I expected.<br /><br />Uninstalled
B004KPQK2S|5.0|This is a great movie, it has a powerful message about faith, love, and women. I highly recommend this movie.
0385344333|2.0|After waiting three months on a library book list, my travel-worn softcover copy was in large print and had either been left in the rain or dropped into a toilet. Because I am a Jack Reacher addict I read it anyway. The plot is fairly well covered in nearly 2000 reviews of regular print copies.<br /><br />Large print editions reveal that Jack Reacher is a hulking Peter Pan but who gets laid less often. Large print challenges the claimed graduation from West Point, and reveals a person with French heritage but no interest whatsoever in Quebec. Lee Child is bored with this protagonist. The book title hints at how bored he is. Time to stop hitchhiking.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|I have to be honest, this was not 1 of my first pics of Christmas movies to own, but this film is 1 of my Ex's FAVORITES! He absolutely loves this movie and he's not really a movie-watcher. Just something about the story (he grew up in the mid-west). I think he can relate to it and I think that's true for alot of people who love this movie. It has just grown on me over the years so I purchased it and I played it on Christmas Day for the family while we celebrated Christmas together. My kids remebered this was their Dad's favorite...and I think they enjoyed it as much as I did. Will always be included in our Christmas celebrations from now on. My grand-daughters loved it as well.
B000W25JUW|5.0|The guys were all still alive for crying out loud.  What was not to love?  This album captures lightning in a bottle and though there will be arguments for sure, but &#34;in the moment&#34; these guys traveled with the 'Stones, The Who and all the other super groups.  When Duane Allman and Dicky Betts get to wailling away on their guitars it is absolute magic and for my money this is one of the top three live albums ever recorded.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|I really liked this movie...the pairing of Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones worked so well. And the story is oh so true of many many couples in their situation. Though true to life the film was so very enjoyable. The ending is great!
B000FC0SIM|5.0|Okay, so the package is a book.  The first half the life of a writer, great bio insights.  The second half is mentoring, musing, and easy to consume advice on writing and being a writer.  It's easy to come back to this time and again because, well, it's Stevie King's writing style.  His advice is sound, sometimes a little more strongly opinionated than others.  He really is a writer's writer even when writing on writing.  Other books on writing are more structured, with nice indexes and chapter and paragraph and subparagraph numbering.  Stevie doesn't offer that, but this is one book on writing that I read like a great novel - I had trouble putting it down.<br /><br />No matter how long you've been writing, no matter what training and education you've had so far, this is not to be missed.<br /><br />It's like spending quality time with a beloved uncle who sincerely wants to help you get into the family business.
B0008ENICU|5.0|The remake was good (so true to the times) but this is a classic!  The cast was excellent and the story so original. A film with all women...who would have thought that would work back at the time this film was made? Fabulous!
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Very good album!  Bought it for my Dad for Christmas!  He loves Taylor Swift :) Definitely more of a pop sound and not very much country feel is left which I prefer from her!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Really enjoyed first kindle read! Story was slightly slow at beginning, but half way through took off!<br />Highly recommended read!!!!
B000IMKDPC|4.0|Very good adaptation of the characters from one of my favorite comic book series when I was younger if you are a fan you will enjoy.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|It got to the point. The chemistry between the characters was awesome. I would recommend the romance readers to try this book. It captivates you.
B008Y7BE7E|5.0|I love movies that manage a balanced delivery and Zombieland is one of them. You have a great balance of story, comedy, and action. The characters each have very memorable personalities that really drive the entire thing.
B005C4ERHQ|2.0|I chose this rating because I have taken several career/personality test over the years and though this uses a different angle then some by finding &#34;strengths&#34; , it doesn't give you much to utilize the findings unless you sign up and pay a lot more $$.<br /><br />The web site is supposed to give more help but not much on there that is free to use.<br />I think this is geared more toward human resource/oraganizations rather than individual.<br />On the positve it was intersting to find my strengths, I was suprised at the results though there is not much help, (unless you pay in) to use the program.<br />I would not recommend this because there is not much help in following through.
B00A0SLTCU|4.0|I have always liked watching the original Total Recall. It was one of those B action movies that just calls to you to watch it. But I actual found this new version better, with a more contemporary story for the issues we have nowadays.
B009ERK1T0|3.0|Koi No Yokan, the 7th album from Deftones, keeps the high level of quality from 2006 Saturday Night Wrist and 2010 Diamond Eyes, picking on the best moments from those records, and adding a stronger touch of melody into it.<br /><br />Deftones music was never easy to digest, but Koi No Yokan is their most accessible/immediate record made until now, because the band focus mainly in mid-tempo and better-structured songs , instead of forced heavy rhythms or those experimental soundscapes found in past records.<br /><br />Fans of early Deftones Nu-metal sound, might dislike KNY at first auditions, because theres no rap/screaming vocals or enough crushing guitars/frenetic groove in here, but for those who start to pay more attention to the band after 2000, you will find this to be another progressive dream-metal challenge, in the vein of their masterpiece White Pony.<br /><br />Alongside Saturday Night Wrist and Diamond Eyes, Koi No Yokan definately confirms the Deftones as one of the best alternative rock bands raised from the 90´s, even if they don't sell records like they used to do.  But, since when art has a prize?<br /><br />My rating: 3,5 stars
B009YMO6SM|4.0|I like to be really picky about giving anything the highest rating and I am really critical about SciFi movies because a lot of times now a days its just a rehash, but this was a great movie with a very cool concept that they managed to bring to convey well, with acting, story, and pacing were all good.
B009AZZEU2|4.0|King Animal tries, like most comeback records, to be safe. Soundgarden were never a singles band like their Seattle neighbors, but even if theres no hits in here, theres a lot of quality in between the songs. And i prefer that way. No hits, just a  consistent, strong record, like those they used to make in the 90´s.<br /><br />The first half of KA is very strong, with Been Away Too Long, Non-State Actor and By Crooked Step, 3 straightforward rock songs that could have been in Badmotorfinger or Superunknown. But after the slow-paced Bones Of Birds the album begins to lose its stream, only to get back on track near the end, with the blues-rock twins of Eyelid's Mouth and Rowing.<br /><br />King Animal ain´t gonna break any new ground for Soundgarden or rock music in general, but for those who lived and loved the alternative rock/grunge made in the late 80/early 90´s, this record will make you forget that we´re already in the 21th century.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This is an interesting character, as he is still not too old to have lots of exciting adventures and still be on top of his game.
B005LAII8A|2.0|Yes. Its not worth and of ordering<br />It, very confusing plot, hard to follow,<br />Actions with Bruce Willis are<br />Good, that's about it,wanted<br />To see it back, but what do u<br />Give as reason,it sucks!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|In Safe Haven by Nicholas Sparks I felt like i was right there with the subjects. I couldn't stop reading it until I finished and was glad that it ended the way I had hoped. it is a really good book and hope others like it as much as I did.
B003H9MSPG|5.0|Because the product is the best.<br /><br />Everything I like. There's nothing I do not like the Longstrike CS-6 Dart Blaster.<br />To all those who want a good Nerf N-Straik.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love period dramas anyways, and this is a great pick.  Liked it so much mom got Seasons 1 &2 for Christmas as a change from the old westerns my dad loves.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Wonderful movie!  Would highly recommend this to others.  Not only is it entertaining, but it tells a story that needs to be heard in this not so ecologically friendly age.
B009MF56GC|4.0|This was just a fun movie to watch with appearances by lots of guys from past action movies.  Non-stop action.
B003MC5AV2|4.0|I loved this book.  It's how most girls feel at that at that age. I wish I could of read it when  was 16.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Girl Gone had me going thru most of the book.  It was full of twists and turns that I didn't see comming.  However I thought the ending just didn't stand up to the rest of the story.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is a great book to have on your kindle fire for Bible study, Church and just reading while traveling.
B00A6SZS2Q|5.0|He loves it and the price better than department stores!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I'd played the game before, so I knew it was a fun one.  Less time-consuming than Risk, but still pretty strategic.  Then there's the variability of the board and the amount of cooperation among players, which changes game-to-game.  Really great game for 4 players.  Not sure about playing it one-on-one, though.
0765325950|5.0|Its not as good as it would be if Robert Jordan had written it, but Brandon Sanderson did a fantastic job. Keep in mind that jordan originally planned for more outrigger novels so  the conclusion is not as neat as it could be. Fansastic. E reader people stop complaining.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is the best game ever it takes skill and its kind of like temple run but it is so much better
B001NLKWLW|5.0|This book was recommended by a friend.  It has been a great read and very hard to put down.  I will definitely read more by the author.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen Hoover is a sensational author and this book is nothing less than exceptional!!!! If you liked Slammed and Point of Retreat, you will LOVE this book! It is pure perfection in every way! Simply put, it's one of the best books I've read.<br /><br />I \\"live\\" Sky and Holder and everything about them. Their relationship is one of a kind and you can feel their intense connection on every page. I love all of of the firsts that they get to experience together and all of the forevers that have yet to come!<br /><br />\\"The moment my lips touch yours, it will be your first kiss. Because if you've never felt anything when someone's kissed you, then no one's ever really kissed you. Not the way I plan on kissing you.\\"― Colleen Hoover, Hopeless<br /><br />Without giving anything away, this book will completely suck you in and take over your heart. It's intense, emotional, beautiful, hopeless and hopeful. This is one story that will remain with you long after you finish reading it. Honestly, go read it right now!<br /><br />[...]
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|Wow, I thought this unique concept would be OK as a rental and possibly humorous, WRONG! don't bother one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Any plot is simply replaced with the frequent use of the &#34;F&#34; bomb. If you like to get stoned and watch movies this might be for you; otherwise skip it don't waste your money. I wish Amazon would refund my rental fee.
B009RI4ZKC|3.0|Although I typically love Wes Anderson, and there was a lot of big name actors in this movie - I felt they weren't really challenged or really being utilized to their fullest ability. It was still entertaining, but I felt it was missing that 'umph!'.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Once I started reading it I got right into it and didn't want to stop. I would tell myself I'll read one more chapter but then it would turn into three or four. I've enjoyed Nicholas sparks books before and this is another one of my favorites by him. You can easily picture everything that's going on and worry about what Katie or Erin is worried about!!!
B005LAII80|4.0|This movie surprised me, and was pleasently entertaining. It was like a stand-alone comic of Dredd - with no love or back story, just straight action and Dredd murdering criminals.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Loved the whole thing! I don't like every character's story but that's been in every book so far. If you like all the other books in the series you are guaranteed to like this one.
B0079HLDCQ|4.0|Typical Baldacci keeps your interest up all the time with some very interesting twists in the story couldn't put it down.
B003INBOE2|1.0|The disc was unable to load the page where you can either Play / Set Up Languages / etc.<br />I couldn't play the movie. The authoring step for a DVD must have not got Q.A. quality assesed. I returnded the DVD for a refund and ordered the plain DVD version instead. I loaded the beggining screen and played just fine.
B0053B347M|1.0|The color was way off on this product. It was more of a bluish purple instead of white (as compared against white on my monitor). The brightness was also too low, and the 'flash' on the iPhone shines brighter than the 6 of these combined. I didn't bother trying the adhesive.
0061122416|5.0|The book tells a great story about a book going after his dreams and eventually becoming a success. Very Inspirational.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this is a great little application. it comes in handy when checking homework or when you don't feel like fling calculations by hand.
B007RI56NY|5.0|I really like this album. It is very upbeat, feel good music. Great album to put on if you need to relax.
B004UQPM4E|5.0|I am simply charmed by the lightening fast delivery by the seller a2z blu-ray. I placed the order on 30th December and I received my shipment on 10th of January 2013 in India. The product is excellent, factory-sealed-new and yes it is exactly as described on Amazon. The quality of Video and the Audio is far superior than expected. All Superman Lovers...This is definitely a Collectible article, don't miss it and do make sure you choose &#34;a2z blu-ray&#34; as seller. Believe me you will be amazed by the quality of service this seller is providing.
B0057UA4FY|4.0|This is a great addition to anyone's Star Wars collection.  All episodes were inspired by the films and addtional characters or scenes had to be approvied by George Lucas himself.  This isn't just a cartoon for kids but can be for anyone who enjoyed the Star Wars films.  Since Star Wars films are so expensive to produce and create and there is so much story to tell it only makes sense to have a cartoon series address different story lines.  Be cautious when purchasing this exact product.  Other reviews suggest that this 4 disc DVD version comes with a 60 something page booklet.  It does not.  I'm not sure if the blu-ray or other versions of this season do.  It's worth the price for the entire season regardless.  Unless Disney makes some drastic changes in accessibility and marketing then it will probably be awhile before you see this show available for streaming (ie. Netflix.)
B00992CF6W|1.0|I paid $7.00 for this just for it to tell me I cant download and it wont get me my money back!!!!!
1452111014|5.0|The book is colorful, full of useful information on creating the movie, and shows how great characters evolve in the artists minds till they are created by.  The movie is wonderful and has a good plot line and the book reflects how it became so wonderful through the analysis of the art of the film.  Shown is how the creators used different media, some unusual, to come up with the worlds of Wreck-It Ralph.  Over all a very special art book.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|its pretty cool you get to mate and have fun with friend. you should try it and its free no money
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I read this because usually when they make a movie of a book the book is good.  I liked this book.  It has romance, action, suspense, not too many wasted words,  Bad guys are bad, good guys are good.  Not great because nothing completely unexpected happens.
0439023491|5.0|Christmas gift for 17yrs old granddaughter - I have read the series and enjoyed them very much-comfortable giving these books
B003L77GGK|5.0|This is great product, better than what they sell in the store. Product arrived before they said it would. I would recommend them again.
0439023513|5.0|Gave to granddaughter to complete the Hunger Games series - I read these books and felt good giving them !
B0041OOJNU|4.0|I have enjoyed listening to this CD. I like the variety of language and I think this may be one of the better Shakira albums that I have heard. It seems a little more mature than previous albums.
0425263916|5.0|Not one for these types of novels, but i got sucked into this one. Its nice to find an author that actually decided to develop the characters a bit and not just fill every page with sex. The only thing i didn't like was the characters obsessiveness with one another, to me it was borderline creepy. Other than that this book is worth a read, or two!
B002Q6OHAK|5.0|Loved hearing it beyond measure. I love that you can have them saved automatically in the Amazon cloud as well.
B003O86FMW|5.0|A lot of unexpected twists and turns!!! You never expect what is going to happen at the end of the book!!!
B006FUUZBS|5.0|my son asked for this book for Christmas.  First time I have ordered a used book.  Was nervous about it but the book turned out to be perfect!
B0043GAZYS|5.0|Love the movie and love the action.<br />Arrived on time, and opened as soon as i got it.<br />Must watch.
B007V5CF5K|1.0|I bought both snark buster games for my kindle fire. I'll play them but then they will not let me go any further. I like what I played of them but it sucks that I pay money for them then I get ripped off.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|3D is okay at times, awesome during most of the movie.<br />All in all, an awesome movie. Recommend to any<br />superhero fan.
B000N2HBSO|4.0|Great history and background for the movie Lincoln. What could be boring in that we already know a lot, Goodwin keeps it very interesting.
0345803485|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  It totally met my expectations. Did not want to put it done.  Looking forward to reading the others.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Really enjoyed this book. I was hooked from the very beginning. I enjoyed the twist of the story aj  how it ended. I'm a sucker for a good love story
0345803485|4.0|I read the first book, and coincidentally stumbled on a Netflix film called Wild Orchid..........This cant possibley be that much of a coincidence that the characters are so similar!!!!
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|The Hunger Games Trilogy by Suzanne Collins is a masterful dystopia: the world portrayed is fully realized. Like all the best dystopias it is believable and its perceptive quality resonates with the discerning reader. In this social commentary disguised as post-apocolyptic science fiction, reality TV is taken to disturbing lengths beyond the role it has in our own time. For the characters and the readers both, the lines are blurred between game and reality because the game is a terrible reality that drives the entire culture. The whole population is forced to participate in the single choice of entertainment as either spectators or gladiators. In _Fahrenheit 451_, Bradbury lightly explored interactive television, but Collins has taken that idea to a whole new level.<br /><br />In the first book, the main hunger is the hunger for survival; the second, the hunger for freedom; and the third, the hunger for innocence. It is interesting how the hungers go up Maaslov's pyramid of basic human needs from physical to mental/spiritual. The more one wins, the more one loses in this nightmare existence.<br /><br />I only gave it four stars on account of its disturbing content. As a young teen myself, I probably would have been bothered by the violence and misapplication of technology to torture. Handle the Hunger Games Trilogy with caution. Do not read for mere idle entertainment. Appreciate its allusions to ancient Rome, but see the darker, deeper warnings for our own post-modern, pleasure-addicted, impersonal culture.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I love u books a lot and this book is so good at details! Make more books I want more
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Such a touching and inspirational story of how one Christian family expressed their faith in a loving and sacrificial way!
B008LV8TSU|4.0|I  Saw the movie for this book.  I absolutely loved the movie.  This book was nice, but some parts confused me.  It was very good.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Let us look at what occurs with these 2 individuals. A woman and a man struggling with trust issues. Just happen to meet and decide to design a relationship for the rest of their life. The ups and downs are always overcome, incredulous but they seem to be able to repair all the errors encountered. Like I wrote wow!
B008SLAXGO|5.0|there are MANY pictures in this book! it is a great coffee table book and it really captures lady gaga as herself  and i have never seen alot of these photos. its amazing i love it!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|just enjoy this game just wish the energy refilled faster to play longer n keep going instead of waitting for more energy. that's the only reason I didn't give a 5 star rating. enjoy the game everyone
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is very Temple Runish. Its fun. the only thing i dont like is that it just seems unrealistic for him and the cop to be running and jumping like that, as if he has diarrhea or something
B0073XV2W2|5.0|Kill Decision is a very satisfying read. I was sorry to finish this book, as there isn't another Daniel Suarez novel immediately available.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|This classic is just that---a classic.  If you have never read it you should.  After reading it, you will find applying the concepts espoused to be doable and easy.  Change your thoughts and change your life!
B000F8O4DQ|5.0|IT'S AMAZING TO HEAR THESE RECORDINGS AGAIN NOW IN 2013. FOR ME , ABSOLUTELY AMAZING..JEFF LYNNE AND COMPANY ARE QUITE ASTONISHING

B001AQT0UY|5.0|really like this movie its really funny and the best movie to see and will see it again and have friends see it
B0009QTS1M|5.0|My son loves this movie and was thrilled with this 3 disc set. Although it arrived the day after christmas, due to the weather my son was still in town  and was very happy with the gift.
1400095204|5.0|6 stars!!!  I could not put this book down.  From the moment that I started it, I took it everywhere I went.  Ms. Adichie is such a brilliant writer, she makes the reader feel as if they are living the story right along with the characters in the book.  Now that I've finished it (sigh), I actually miss them.  This work will stay with me for quite some time.  I already feel changed because of it.  READ THIS BOOK.  I'm now off to read everything else she's written!
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Amazing show!!! Amazing acting, outstanding cast! My ONLY problem with the show is walts wife, and sister in law, I just dot not like these characters. They are the only characters with bad acting. So worth the money!!! Buy every season!!!!
B000002J29|5.0|This is the third time I've purchased this album in my life; first vinyl, then CD, and now CD again because the kids lost one of the disks.  It is my favorite album of all times.  One of the 3 best concerts I ever saw (1978), surpassed only by Led Zeppelin and UFO.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This was such an amazing book! It kept me wanting to read more throughout the whole thing!<br />I can't wait to see what the next book brings!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|love G5 games. The maps are useful. Mini puzzles are always a challenge keeps you thinking.<br />Also there isn't a ton of dialogue.<br />4 1/2 stars for sure!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe Haven was a delight to read and very hard to put down. Nicholas Sparks has done it as again!!
B004PGAQMW|4.0|This movie is fun for the whole family. Smart, memorable...a keepsake for sure. We have watched it as a family so many times that we have lost count. It never gets old. Very well done !
B00866H7SS|5.0|Bared To You - Loved it great read couldn't put it down till finished. Couldn't wait for the next book.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The connection between the two main characters is touching. The hardships they endured only brought them closer and confirmed they are soul mates.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Dark Arcana was a fun game. It took me an hour to play, but it kept me occupied. It was twisted and dark, but fun. Hopefully, the sequel will last longer.
B006UG909U|2.0|From a guitarist's standpoint... I think Eddie dropped the ball on this one. If there was one thing I always looked forward to on a Van Halen album, it was Eddie's tasty guitar leads. These seem to be almost non-existent in these recordings. What's more, Eddie's overall sound is \\"mushy\\".<br /><br />Van Halen's attempt to fit into today's style of music misses the mark for me. One listen to the beginning of \\"Stay Frosty\\" makes me think and wonder why? Why did they want Roth to be so awful here? Is this their take on what they think we want today? One return listen to \\"Women and Children First\\" makes me remember Van Halen for the kings they once were.<br /><br />For me, I choose to remember the Van Halen of the past. Back when Eddie took his rightful place as the ultimate rock guitar music creator. Call me old, but I long for the days when Eddie was more of what all of us guitarists went running to the Capitol Centre to see...A master at work.
B00B19DMUE|5.0|I was nicely surprised.... great acting, great suspense, kept my interest till the end.  Very good for those that like the almost close to real stuff... not the gory stuff...
B003O86FMW|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed this series. It has been hard to put the book down! I'm looking forward to book #3!
B000KIRT6A|5.0|Behringer often gets a bad rep for making sub standard gear but that is certainly NOT the case with this pedal. For the money I'm thrilled with the pedal and the sound quality is great. The EQ and pass through work well. It's made of plastic but the construction is solid and it's got some great range on the boost. I just needed a good solid EQ with some boost and that's what I got. If you need something solid and straight forward and don't have a lot of money I recommend getting this pedal. Heck, it's a nice pedal to keep in your arsenal when you need a little something extra on your guitar. I use this on my six and twelve string acoustics for live performance and it does not disappoint.
034580404X|1.0|Everyone at work was raving about this book, so I bought it for someone who loves to read and will read just about anything, she hated this book, said it was the most disgusting thing ever put to print
B0055PGUYU|5.0|I heard the author interviewed on NPR and felt I had to read his book, and I was right.  This is a thought provoking investigation into the concept of habits, how we form them, and how we might potentially change them.  Although much of the information is anecdotal, the scientific references are presented for those who want to investigate further.  Not a self help book, but one which will provoke some serious introspection and thus contribute to changing habits for the good.
B001974DG0|5.0|I have read this book many times. The story never gets old. Dogs are unique creatures in that they always love first. I hope to one day have a true conversation with an animal such as Einstein in hopes of unlocking them. To all dogs that have been loved and loved in return. Thank you.
B004SUWR2C|1.0|INITIAL file download is 1.8 MB  for 99 cents - sounds like a deal, huh?  REMEMBER IF IT LOOKS TOO GOOD, IT ISN'T<br />And then after playing for 2 weeks, I have to download another 92 (YES! NINETY-TWO) MB... do you AMAZON think everyone is stupid????  Take a hike !  I think I'm going to short the stock.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Who can resist a Bosch novel? Certainly not anyone who's already read one. I'll keep up with Harry and keep admiring his determination and irreverence as long as Connelly writes more.
0765325950|5.0|Had to rate this a 5. Best book in the series. Thanks for finishing it for us. It was awesome.
B007V5CF5K|3.0|gave 3 stars because so far we like the game but just like on the last alawar game i bought it constantly just stops and goes straight to menu screen so this is last alawar game I will buy until I see A LOT of reviews that it is fixed
B009U9S6FI|5.0|Dr. Frankl affirms concepts, virtues, values, ideals and healthy 'laws' for all but especially for &#34;healing and Healers. It is identifiable to the pains of the suffering and all who need growth.  His messages will rest along side the greatest of all thinkers and richly affirms positive universal concepts for spiritual growth and &#34;survival for man.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|Saw this on T.V., but liked it so much I decided to buy it and watch it at my leisure.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|A bit gory at times and a very sad plot.  I am surprised at how it portrayed the ease with which the kids could kill each other.
B000HWZ4A2|5.0|The story is done well and is true to the book.<br />The acting is highly dramatized but this is true of movies from this era<br />A good story that keeps you interested until the surprising end.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|one day I had a magician like totaly came to like school and like totalty came to my school and like did a trick with like eggs
1932735410|5.0|this is the only book needed outside of the PMBOK for anyone studying for the PMP exam. I used one other book and it was not as thorough as this book. I highly recommend you purchase this book if you want to pass the first time.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Very addicting....... I love this game. It's a very good version. Just like on my phone, even better! I highly recommend buying it.
B00AF6MF9I|2.0|Great game but half of the time it fails to load and save the last actions you just spent an hour or more playing the game. Becoming very frustrating.
B00003CXE7|4.0|Gladiator is a fine, well made film which offers great entertainment and some excellent performances. But although it takes it's inspiration from 60s movies The Fall Of The Roman Empire and Spartacus, it can't compare with those great films on some levels. The much hyped CGI set of the Colosseum, for example, doesn't look as impressive as the sets built by Samuel Bronston's team for The Fall Of The Roman Empire, because those sets were actually BUILT and what you see on the screen is real. Also the visual sweep of both films is unmatched here. Spartacus and Fall really do offer a feast for the eyes, but for me at least, Gladiator can't quite manage this. To my eyes, CGI can't hold a candle to solid reality.<br /><br />The acting is fine in Gladiator. Russell Crowe is superb as Maximus; easily the equal of Kirk Douglas' Spartacus - and I'll concede he's far superior to Stephen Boyd's equivalent character Livius in Fall. But the greatest pleasure for me was to be found in veteran actors Richard Harris (Marcus Aurelius) and Oliver Reed in what was sadly his final role as Proximo. Harris manages to invoke subtle shades of his King Arthur from Camelot to the Roman Emperor weary of war and wanting only the best for his people, while still portraying a substantially different character. Reed reminds us once again of the genuine talent so often obscured by the public persona in his portrayal of the callous gladiator school owner who regains his humanity.<br /><br />Where Gladiator does triumph, is in it's abilty to express the sheer depth of the inhumanity and evil that drove the Romans to lust for gladiatorial combat. It's portrayed unflinchingly in all it's gory horror. Censorship in the 60s prevented Stanley Kubrick from this in Spartacus, although he pushed the envelope as far as he could. A simple shot of a terrified man urinating himself in fear captures the horror perfectly.<br /><br />In the final analysis, however, it doesn't ultimately compare with the classic 60sfilms which inspired it, though it remains a worthwhile and enjoyable modern epic.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love that I can read my Bible any time, any place on my Kindle Fire.  The Kindle Fire was a gift from my loving granddaughter and I downloaded the Bible app so I can carry the Bible in my purse easily.....<br />signed..... Montana Grandma
B0074QGGK6|4.0|Lot of great ideas to inspire you on how to be more creative. Strongly recommended for those who work on creative market.
B00A8SPNYW|4.0|The game animations are adorable. The sounds are cute too. Nice challenges to pass the time.<br />Wishlist:<br />A way to erase the move you make before playing without having to go to menu and level select. That seems the only way to change your move even if you fail the level. If that was changed would make game play nicer.<br />I really love that rascal mouse
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This is a really fun game. The only problem I have is the peanuts and some of the stuff you need them for. I do love the game over all.
B001EYGOG0|5.0|But this was a delightful CD. It was a gift for my dad, and he was quite pleased with it, so I'd say it was a success!
B003SHYVO8|1.0|I started watching this movie and shut it off about ten minutes in.  Same old, same old.  Tough girl meets rich guy, street life meets dance academy, blah, blah, blah.  Best part was Channing Tatum in the beginning.  Other than that, don't spend money to watch this.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This book has been one of my best reads in a long time.  Interesting story, compelling characters.  It all felt smooth and hung together very well.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Would love for this to turn into a series. If it's not already. Thanks for the free read<br /> Amazon. On to the next.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|well it is so much fun  to play do i have to wright twantey words do i have anaf words yet yes or no
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|WOW WOW WOW!<br />Those are the exact words I repeated after reading this book. I've never written a book review before, and I've read plenty of books. Example \\"13 reasons why\\" and \\"looking for Alaska\\". But this book blew me away. The connection between Sky and Holder makes Bella and Edward look like child's play. This book is beautifully written; I applaud you Colleen Hoover for this incredible page turning, heart beating, breathe holding, tear jerker, heart warming book! LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS BOOK! I recommend it, trust me you won't want to put it down.
0143036556|5.0|jarads books are very well studied and respected i would recommendthis book to anyone who wants to learn about our world

B008K6HN8I|5.0|This is a great program. My tablet came with a stock file viewer that made it hard to delete files but ESFE took care of that problems.
B005DI65L2|5.0|Well researched and written book about how dogs percieve and react to the world.  If you are a dog owner, this book is a must-read!
B008MEM24S|5.0|Love it. Great for kids and adults.  I'm hooked!  My 4 y/o niece stumbled  across 'Where' s My Water' and I've been spiraling out of control ever since then playing all of its constituents.  Lol
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I found this to be an outstanding book. It was an amazing story of heart,determination, and much variety of religion
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|1) Rating: 4 out of 5 stars    2) Genre: Fantasy    3) Synopsis: Shai must use her unique magic to save a nation. She doesn't need to stop the bad guys. She needs to remake the good guy. The question is can she do it before she is killed.    4) Feelings: I love Brandon Sanderson. One of the best things he does is the uniqueness of his magical systems. This magical system is certainly unique but something about it just didn't work for me. The story was interesting and a page-turner but missing something.    5) Final recommendation: If you are a Sanderson fan, this is certainly worth a read. Pick it up. If you are looking to try Brandon for the first time this is not the one I would recommend.    Ryan James Burt  Husband, Father, and Writer  [...]
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great read! Didn't want to put it down! Can't wait to read book two & three! Highly recommended for any age.
0756404738|4.0|1) Rating: 4 out of 5 stars    2) Genre: Fantasy    3) Synopsis: Kvothe continues his telling of his perilous search for answers about the Chandrian even as he grapples with more pressing dangers.    4) Feelings: It really is hard to believe that a biography of a fictional character can be so interesting. I couldn't put this book down. I made time to read it when I could. There was a part in the middle that slowed the story down a lot but I am totally invested in Kvothe's story.    5) Final recommendation: If you read and liked the first book this is a must read. I have no idea when the next book is due to come out but I will be reading it the day it comes out.    Ryan James Burt  Husband, Father, and Writer  [...]
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|I read this book in two days because I couldn't put it down. (Read on my Kindle Fire) Harold Fry, examining his life as he makes his way north across England, reinforced my experience of the necessity of introspection if cultivating an interior life. In order to appreciate his journey, I recommend suspending practicalities and enjoying his company. We have trouble imagining life without a cell phone or credit card, but it isn't an impossible circumstance. My ONLY criticism was the 'Forest Gump' similarities of people joining Harold on his walk. Otherwise, I cared about the characters and the universality of their journey.
0765325950|5.0|Having grown up on this series, I found myself awaiting with some trepidation at the release of the last novel. it is impressive in scope, impressive in scale, and exquisite in the payoff. For anyone who's made it this far, it's a must.
B008XG1X18|5.0|My initial interest in Pinterest was to link my boards to a novel I have written and my Wordpress site. I read several books through amazon to learn how to make the most of Pinterest. I have taken a lot of care with my boards, policing them regularly to be sure I haven't double pinned something. I took care with naming the boards and what I write to explain the board. Others have done a wonderful job along the same lines that make going to their boards a pleasure. Just repinning a bunch of stuff that aren't even good close up images quickly sends me away from that pinner. The time I have spent in the Pinterest world has been fun, informative, a sharing of passions with others around the world. And, it has brought people to my Wordpress, a few even buying the novel I hoped they would take a chance on.
B003V9OCIS|5.0|I wasn't sure at first since I am often not a fan of subtitled movies. However, this is overall a spectacular film. It does an excellent job of portraying the difficulty of climbing in the early years, with less than adequate gear, and the many problems that it caused. As an avid mountaineering fan I can certainly say this is one of the top 10 films ever made in this genre. A must see for all aspiring and professional climbers alike.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I wish that it was some way to play this game on facebook or lab top... I play the game on my cell and I love!  My granddaughter have the family hook. ;-( Today I lost my park not sure how. All I know the app keep telling me that I have lost my park and to sign into FB I've done that but no luck I don't want to start over I was at level 16. A lot of work was put into it. I have wrote to the support team but as of now no luck this has been since 2 this afternoon. If I can put it on my lab top would be great but I will be happy just to have my park back if not I want play anymore
B000000XB8|5.0|Their stuff was before my time but I grew up listening to many of their songs. Even with &#34;greatest hits&#34; albums bands put out I always find a song or two that I don't particularly care for. That's not the case with this greatest hits; every song truly is a hit.
B0044RUSZM|5.0|This is my second Griffin stand as I have two work stations. I have tried others and find this to be the best ergonomically and it dissembles well for travel.
B007PZADLO|5.0|Train has been a favorite band of mine since Drops of Jupiter was released. I was happy to hear of their return and this album proves they still got it.
0307888444|4.0|Was easy to read, well written, informative and thought provoking. I liked it well enough to recommend it to my book club for our February meeting.
B001DUKHXQ|5.0|Receiving this record was a thriller. It is a double-sided picture disc and it sounds great. The songs included are some of his best. I definitely recommend this LP.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I read all of Flynn's books and this one was a page turner. I did not want to finish it.
B00A50PDDY|5.0|This is absolutely one of the most enjoyable albums I have listened to. Twenty One Pilots combine great rap with intense drums, and every song's lyrics have impact, making you want to listen to this album over and over. The music video for \\"Holding On To You\\" is incredible too. Check this band out - you won't regret it.
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|I've played this before on my phone but it wouldnt work on my Kindle. I'm sure I done it right. Wished it worked,
140003180X|5.0|I am enjoying the series -  a must read.  I'm learning a lot about Botswana and Africa in general. Great writer.

B0063IH60K|4.0|This soliaire app is very easy to load and to play. I've become addicted to playing, and you only have to put up with an advertisement before each game.
0756688701|5.0|My 7 year old grandson, who is a Disney pixar car enthusiast , LOVED this book. Christmas eve he was busy reading this book sitting among his many other gifts. He read the entire book which describes all the various disney vehicles with pictures of them all. It comes with a little Lightning McQueen car . The book is a nice quality hard covered book. It is a great buy for a disney car enthusiast or collector with a very fair price.
0789723107|5.0|Can't say enough good things about this book.  I've since bought this and the second edition many times over for friend and clients.  Don't wait, just get it.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Enjoyed the acting by everyone - the story line is very touching, filled with the best of humanity! Highly recommended!
B007PVHANM|4.0|the dvd is well recorded, it also arrived on time. we are all fans of Bob Marley, so we do appreciate it
B0079R8IYW|3.0|I like this case and think that it will provide adequate protection; however, I don't like the way the case is put into a reclined position.  It folds back into a slot and it never works for me; it comes out my Kindle falls flat.
B0029XFNA8|5.0|You can't go wrong with this one. Such a cute tale and instantly makes the whole house feel extra Christmas-ee!
B009U9S6FI|5.0|i have read many of this type of book, this one is both interesting and educational. i would read it again.
0811879542|5.0|My three-year-old son wants to read this EVERY time it's his turn to pick a book. Perfect for that preschool age.
B007SGM084|5.0|I love this trilogy! Myself and three others read the entire series in a matter of days. Once you pick these books up you cant put them down!
B005VPRET4|4.0|We got this for my just turned six-year-old daughter, and she needed A LOT of help with it. Maybe needed a year or two before she was ready...
B00APUQRPC|4.0|This movie was very entertaining......no great messages or morals just an pleasant way to spend an evening......I wish that there were more of these types of movies around
0395389496|5.0|My kids saw the movie before we ever bought the book (sad I know), but now that we own it I think the movie did a second rate job of portraying this wonderful book!
B000SEJHRA|4.0|SIMILIAR TO NAKED. A UNIQUE AUTHOR WITH A UNIQUE STORY. I WAS HIGHLY AMUSED WHILE READING. ENJOYED EVERY SENTENCE. YOU WILL LAUGH OUT LOUD.
B005JR47R6|5.0|The show finale was an extraordinary show.  It was surprising, original, and thought-provoking like many of the other show episodes.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I loved it so much. Everyone  has a good ending.  I would recommend this book to everyone. Thank you people.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Wonderful cast smart humor easily one of the funniest shows on TV.  I own every season and have watched multiple times and they still make me laugh.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I enjoy Facebook because it gives me the opportunity to catch up with family and friends,and it also has some great games for your entertainment.
030758660X|4.0|I knew how to knit back when I was younger and I had recently gotten back into the knitting craft. I ended up stumbling onto the book and decided purchase the book. The book came quickly, which is a plus and the patterns are interesting, which makes me want to try them out.<br /><br />But I suggest that it should be bought by knitters who know at least the basic stitches (knit purl, etc). The book doesn't teach you on how to start knitting and I am one who is used to using videos to know what to do for my knitting. But the patterns that range from simple things such as Tourniquet Scarf and the Imprint Pillow for more beginner knitters (like myself), to The Lore Hoodie and the Little Fang Sweater for intermediate skilled knitters, all the way to the Prim Reaper's Corset (yes, there is an underbust corset that you can knit!) for those of advance skills.<br /><br />Overall, the book is fascinating with some fun patterns and bits and pieces about vampires that we have come to know about through tv and movies. I'm actually about to do the Imprint Pillow and I hope to getting around to making all of the patterns in here. Thanks Vampire knits for getting me back into my old knitting hobby!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Nice to be able to get a 10 day forecast for future plans during the week in an instant, very pleased to have it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Slow to start, but you definitely get drawn in.  AMAZING ending.  Tears in the eyes, but it wouldn't be a Nicholas Sparks novel otherwise, now would it?!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Great game which makes you think and have fun at the same time,having a great time playing it..nice addition to my kindle
B003TSEEDY|3.0|Saw the reviews and expected sheer awesomeness, but it kinda seemed like something you'd read while on drugs... Not a whole lot of it made sense, and I kept expecting to have a critical question answered, but the book never resolves it.  Having said that, there are some great quotes in there, and I did feel like I was on Cloud Nine as I read them.  Not sure I can say I really liked it, though, bottom line.
B0042FZOFU|5.0|Very pleased with the product that I ordered from Amazon.com. My son enjoys this movie box set very much. He got it from Santa this year!
B0007MWZEK|1.0|The product itself is a great one because I was replacing it for one that I have had 3 years.  The battery was charged for 8 hours just as recommended but it will not hold a charge so I must return it.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Amazing, fast paced, no hold-backs to slow it down, funny at parts keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B009NF6IPE|5.0|Having visited India a half dozen times, I noticed how acurately she portrayed the country and its people.  At times I felt like I was back in India.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book is very good. I would suggest this to anybody who likes to read about war from a great man's perspective this book is not really graphic must read!!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|It is so sad to think that young women are reading this book and may think that this is the way to live and love.  I felt so sad for her as she was so controlled and felt that this was the way it is supposed to be.  So depressing.
B000W9399S|5.0|Very fun to read,  and only 39 book in the series, I might be done with them all in three years!
B0052RDHTM|3.0|I ordered the paperback version of this book.  The print in the book was almost minute which made the reading of this quite lengthy book very uncomfortable.  I ended up ordering the Kindle version which is fine.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Best so far for free apps. It works even when the app isn't open.  works better than others I've tried.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This APP is a lot of fun!  My daughter has been playing it for hours and she is really enjoying building her zoo!
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I stumbled across this book on Amazon.  I am glad I did.  Fascinated by the plot, I could not put it down.  Although a bit of a troglodyte when it comes to technology, the old world charm of some of the characters and the intersection of an old world intellectual cult and contemporary techies made for a fun and gripping read.  Highly recommended.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|It was a book  I could not put down. It was a great read.Iread it before I saw the movie, and enjoyed the book more.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|had a great time watching it. I liked this movie because it was what I wanted. Yes i would recommend this to anyone.
B00ABXA1HI|4.0|Splashtop2 seems to work fine for my Kindle to remote into a remote PC.  I haven't used it a lot, but it seems to work great.
B00A8SPNYW|3.0|if you have problems with headaches or motion sickness this app isn't for you.......but it is still a fun cute little game
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Rod, at his best. The cd was played over and over during the holidays and beyond. If you are a Rod Stewart fan you will not be disappointed.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This second book was so excellent. I really enjoyed this one. I can't wait to read the last book. Wow!
B009P5S11G|1.0|This item was purchased sometime ago. I have not received it. Numerous other transactions have been successful but not this one. I wish to have a new cd sent asap as this was a gift, now an extremely late gift. I will not continue to purchase items if this issue is not attended to. MOST DISAPPOINTED!
B001JP5JRY|5.0|This was one of the funniest book I ever read. Remember to follow the code at all times. Gonna read the Playbook now.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The writing style is a little different, I thought he jumped around from plot to plot to much. I have read most of authors  books. I guess that is the reason I found it intriguing.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|I am a big Harry Potter fan, have a complete collection. The Blue Ray is very nice too. Have a complete collection of the books too.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I would recommend this book for young female adults. The beginning was really good but towards the end it got a little boring. It is a good quick read.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|This is our 4th Swivel Sweeper. One of our friends requested this as a Christmas gift. We purchased the least expensive model to see how long the rechargeable battery lasts. We've only been able to get 2 years out of them. We noticed they started selling the batteries separately, which is a good thing, because the sweepers themselves last and last and last. You can really get down low under tables and dressers, and this does a decent job of \\"in between vacuuming\\" pick ups. I recommend this product.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|I love it. It works great.  If i had to point out any negative, thenit would be that it sometimes slides out ofthe horizontal stand alone feature... other than that its exactly what i wanted.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|On some pdfs kindle does not display them properly. In particular a textbook I have is showing up with letters missing randomly when opened under kindle, but with with this adobe app it displays perfectly. I'm not sure what causes this and its actually quite baffling. Also the scroll down is a lot nicer and more fluid than flipping pages like in kindle. It allows you to search and do other functions as well.
B005JLN9ZI|4.0|The disk was in great condition and the case was in great condition. The only problem was that this version of the album didn't come with &#34;The Motto&#34;
B002N5N5R0|5.0|Although this review is only for season two - the Sons of Anarchy is a good series and will keep you wanting to see all the seasons.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|It's perfect! Extra long cable is very convenient and allows for easy mobility when downloading from your computer to your Kindle.
B000062V9C|5.0|This is a great movie for all ages.  Sully is a kind monster that you wouldn't mind having in your closet.
0756982596|5.0|I grew up with this book. It's adorable especially if you have a thing for llamas. The illustrations are beautiful and the story is simple but memorable.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|It was pretty easy way first then on your way too the third level i would say you have to concentrate
B001TH16DI|5.0|We bought these for my father in law who is a big trekkie. He loved the Blu Rays. They are very clear, sound is great, and they have amazing commentary. He said, &#34;hands down best gift of the season!&#34;
141659521X|5.0|I generally enjoy Vince Flynn's novels but this is my favorite!!  I could not put it down.  There are a few typos in the Kindle version -- I hope the author (or his editor) corrects them soon -- but it did not deter me from giving it five stars because it is that good!  Looking forward to reading more about Mitch Rapp in the future. Please hurry and give us your next novel, Mr. Flynn!!
0385338910|5.0|i think this book is going to be very beneficial in helping me relate to the lovely widow in my life...but for me it's a slow read..cuz i cry every time i start reading. the man knows grief for sure.
B0036EH40Q|5.0|It's hard to beat the Searchers by John Wayne as the best western ever, but I give this a 5 star rating nonetheless. This movie is crazy good - a movie one can watch over and over and over again. Make sure to watch it on a nice big HD screen with surround sound and you will feel the same way.<br />Definitely a keeper in anyone's western collection!
B0078X2LKY|5.0|Loved this book as a child. Now my 3 yr old loves it. Her favorite part is turning the pages and the way Grover reacts to it
B003OBA516|4.0|I'm prejudiced. I've been following this band since they released the song &#34;99&#34;. I have nearly all their albums on iTunes and now 2 of their concert films. It's non-stop music for an hour and a half. Both concert films have a blend of old and new music. If they released another concert film, I'd buy that one as well.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love to play solitaire and have for quite a while.  I used to play on the computer, but it's much easier to play on the Kindle Fire and I win a lot more.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|very fun and interesting. did not realize it wasn't the whole game but I will be buying the whole game.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|It was very complicated and hard to follow - too many details.  I wanted to read it before seeing the movie.  The movie was wonderful and the book did give me some understanding even though I never finished reading it.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I loved all the books!! I love the love story!! Great story of love and a life different from ours!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a while. The story keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B00AR83PN4|2.0|does not always remove rows of 3; makes for a frustrating game.  waste of money for my kindle.  not recommended.  hopefully they will come out with a fix meanwhile wont be playing anymore.
B005SCSL56|5.0|This book is super good I learned more about fairy tales in this book than any book I ever read
B000O8OTNC|4.0|I bought this as a compliment to a SOG pocket knife for a Christmas gift and was given rave reviews.  My bff took it to work and he and the guys &#34;bonded&#34; over knife sharpening.  LOL Great buy at only $8.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great Book!! Great characters! Couldn't put it down. Finished in one day! Has everything! Comedy, romance, mystery, drama and a great twist!!! Highly recommended!!
0375703764|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. House of Leaves was a challenging read- not in terms of my ability, rather, it challenged my mind.    I do a weekly video book review on youtube: the first video in the series was on House of Leaves-[...]
B00AAX68HG|3.0|I really wanted to like this game, but I feel that the ads are distracting.  I got this as a free app of the day, so I suppose I can't complain too much.  The ads are not easy to skip, requiring you to carefully find the small icons or fine print to continue to your game.  Gameplay is quite good, requiring strategy and spatial reasoning to construct a pudding monster without sliding off of the game board.
B0054X3FQO|2.0|I live a balanced and healthy & positive life.. life lessons and hard work have got me this far.. and im still a spring chicken.<br />But seriously?  I gave up after 10 pages.  I would like my money back please.<br /><br />One star for the effort One star for the pretty pictures.
B005LAIHPY|3.0|I have to admit when I saw the trailer for Battleship - I thought it was all about the alien race is going to kick some serious butt and we don't have the technology to stop them but somehow we managed to steal the ship and turn it against them. Unfortunately this wasn't the case but why this movie was far fetched is any of our weapons like the shells or missiles from our ships wouldn't be able to dent much of a large alien ship like this.<br /><br />Overall the movie is good to watch, average acting but nice special effects
B005H0IW6W|4.0|I am quite partial to Michael B. as far as I am concerned, he can sing the phone book and it will be entertaining
B009MF56GC|5.0|This movie sequel to the original The Expendables literally on my books rocked my house and my friends who watched it with me loved it. A great blockbuster movie had turned into a must see!
B00004BZ0N|5.0|stands the test of time. Anyone that considers themselves to know punk/rock genre, knows the Clash. Can't go wrong with this purchase.
B009B8YZKS|5.0|There is one thing that disappointed me the most was that it was short in the end except it was well worthwhile for anyone to watch it.<br /><br />All things considered they should have made this more into a series for the events after Halo4 timeline.
B0063IH60K|3.0|This game is your typical on-line solitaire game.  I down loaded and tried it but have really not played it much.
B005LAIHQS|4.0|MIB3 is worthwhile seeing but its not a funny, or action packed like on the previous two movies. The original had more to offer, however the special effects in MIB3 made up for it and was enjoyable
B0086700CM|3.0|My son downloaded this game and played it once.  My 7 year old granddaughter had tried it but a little too complex for her.  I've not tried it.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|The Avengers movie is slightly different to what you have already seen in the cartoon version of this, but this film is worthwhile watching and filled with action and hillarious scenes as well. Worth watching it
B009JBZH54|5.0|I purchased this as a gift for my husband for Christmas.  He loves it and the cost was comparable to other places.
B002ZG99A4|5.0|Awesomeness movie that I probably wouldn't have seen anything like this in a long time. I would highly recommend getting this and the sequel
B004RJMUJO|4.0|My 7 year old granddaughter loves this game.  She plays it often and enjoys.  It is an easy to use children's game.
B0088X7YU0|4.0|This movie wasn't the greatest in comparison to the original Starship Troopers movie. However the animation is what I loved the most and I believed that we should see more Starship Troopers movies as hightech as this one, its worthwhile seeing definately for sure.
B009O2XY12|3.0|I downloaded this game because it was no cost.  It's an okay game to play and quite addictive.  I just got busy on more complex games.
B005LAII3U|4.0|Great movie title, gets your sitting on the edge of the couch wondering what is going to happen next, worthwhile waiting
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved everything about the book. The subject, the characters & all the conflicts. Wonderful twists and turns that Gillian writes so flawlessly.
1439102430|4.0|I returned from vaction and found 'Bones Are Forever' waiting for me at home. I received it from Goodreads giveaways.<br />This is the first time I have read a book by Kathy Reichs. I am happy that I did so. I very much enjoyed this gripping and suspenseful story. The novel kept me wanting to read more all the way through. The author had a varied set of characters, which included interesting dialog to offset some of the tension. Her interesting technical details added to the story as did her various plot twists.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It was a great book and the ending just makes you not want to put the book down!! Highly recommend. One of my favorites of Sparks
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I haven't finished the whole book yet but I can't wait to get back to it to find out what's going on next.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Didn't want to put the book down. It's a fun read. I'm excited to start reading the third book. Thanks.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This game is awesome, even my 18 month old grandaughter loves throwing the birds....<br />If you like the other angrey bird games, I recommend Star Wars as well!
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|I'm beating myself up because I didn't listen to this sooner! I have Sirius radio in my car so my saved channels are that of The Heat, The Groove, mainly R&B and Hip-Hop and I couldn't wait to hear &#34;Thinkin' Bout You&#34; when it first came out......absolutely love that joint! Then &#34;Lost&#34; was another fave. I'm so hooked that I had to add a Frank Ocean Pandora channel just so I could jam while on the go. Ocean's got a killer voice and his lyrical styles are amazing, and he's just so extremely talented......I can't get enough! Excited to see what uniqueness his next album will bring!
B0025VLEM0|5.0|Excellent
0394800389|5.0|I bought this for my 2nd grader who is a proficient reader, because the rhymes and tangled sentences are great for reading accuracy, and because I always thought it was fun when I was a kid. Used is a great option for young kids. It's still in good shape, but doesn't need as much protection as the new books I buy them.
B001GKJ2FW|5.0|Excellent
0394800192|5.0|My kids love this story. Easy for early readers. Seller had used version in very good condition. I bought several Seuss early readers and didn't want to pay $8 each. I'm very happy with the quality, and my daredevil daughter loves to 'read' this to herself regularly.
B0086700CM|5.0|something fun to do when you are in the car waiting for the wife to come back from shopping trip.
B004Y042N8|5.0|My child and I both love this game.  We have both played it at some point everyday so far.  It is fun but also makes you think.  I would recommend this game.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Bought it new, and lo and behold, it was new.  Good quality.<br /><br />It is a shame that Firefly only lasted one season.  IKt was a very entertaining show, with great characters.  Serenity was a well done extension of the series.  I am glad to own both and will watch them numerous times.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was told by a friend to read it, I was sceptical.  I could NOT put it down.  Absolutely the best.  Every page I turned, I couldn't wait to get to the next.  Great writer.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|that Firefly only lasted for one season.  Great stories and characters.<br /><br />I am not a huge sci-fi guy, but the combination of westerns and the future is very well done by Joss Wheedon.<br /><br />The extras are great, especially the snippet on how the ship Serenity was created.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I'm a 14 year old and I'm loving this game... its amazing I cant put it down 'nough said ;)
B005LAII80|5.0|This was a poorly marketed film.  I can say that with certainty because I saw previews for this and was unimpressed, but when I actually watched the movie I was blown away.<br /><br />Loved the dry humor.  \\"He just changed his mind\\" is one of my favorite lines in a movie from recent memory.<br /><br />Movie is like a mash up of Dirty Harry, Die Hard, Robocop, Minority Report, and Training Day.<br /><br />The studio that made this really dropped the ball.  This will be a cult classic.  A sequel with Urban in the lead could be quite profitable.<br /><br />The 3-d was quite good on this disk.  Highly recommend.
B000002P2V|5.0|My daughter born in 1993 has become a big &#34;The Who&#34; , Freddie Mercury and Queen fan. She loves this CD. It's on her ipod which she listens to in the car and at school. It's on her computer which she listens to while studying. She is very happy with this one.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I would recommend this book to any reader.Was a sceptic and finally read it and have thou roughly enjoyed it
B005S9EKCW|1.0|I wonder if I can disagree with many opinions about this new version of LES MISERABLES. Everybody (or almost everybody) gives hurrah, but I have to say the contrary as some journalists have rightly written, because for me this is a very bothersome and bad movie. In France the film has not been received as a miracle. I do prefer the old films with the great performances of Friedrich March/Charles Laughton or Harry Baur/Charles Vanel to this thing. Those who love it must not feel as offended, they have to continue loving it, but let me say I do not envy them.<br />Ernesto/Genova - Italia
B0054LJGWS|5.0|I first read this book in the early 90's - I was young and a Douglas Adams fan, found this and really enjoyed it.  When I got older, I remembered this book and started looking for Pratchett's novels and Gaiman's novels.<br /><br />Recently, I went back and re-read this book. It was better the second time around (and didn't skip Anathema's bits which I had done before). Laugh out loud funny. Frequently, I ponder Crowley's method of house plant up-keep and wish I could apply it.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The Hunger Games Trilogy<br />Loved the story, couldn't put it down. So glad it was recommended to me. Good read.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|Nothing special.  The writer comes off lazy as well as poorly written compared to most; however, it was entertaining enough.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|If you like Bruno Mars you will enjoy this cd. I'm glad you can hear each song before you buy.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|There is a lot of the writing that seems a cheap copy of the twilight books, too much in common and poor choices. I mean we have 51 states why Washington again? Why the similar background stories of her mom, why another virgin with no self-esteem?
B007VT6QSI|5.0|found this on Amazon and I'm not one too buy cd's. but the price was good and you could hear a little bit of each song before you bought.
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|I go this app because my tv uses the same on to stream movies from my computer and it works good so far.
B002BWP49C|5.0|have watched all of these movies and this one isn't any different. The movie is just what I ordered. If you like these order!
B000VWYJ86|5.0|Excellent Pace, Action and Mystery. You can watch all three back to back and not become bored. Each viewing your knowledge of each character and the developing plot. However the Books are even more exciting and intriguing. After reading the first 3 novels/books Movies are a different story. Excellently conceived. Books transcends the The Movies. Just as The Godfather did ti that movie adaptation.
B009IJJB8G|5.0|I love the way the writers and producers have updated the relationship between Holmes and Watson, as well as translated the written word into a rich, physical world.
B008EZVNFE|5.0|always can count on you amazon to come thru with a good price and quality merchandise. keep up the good work
B00000JNOJ|5.0|If you get the chance to listen to this cd, it will be like listening to music for the first time ever. You will wonder how you have gone so long without listening to music of this caliber. It is something you just have to experience.
B005CKPQ7A|5.0|more please, this is an entertaining series but the wait time between seasons is too long. There seems like enough material to warrant an additional season, at least.
B00992CF6W|5.0|AWESOME! Loving it! Would recommend this to ages 10yrs & up! I can't turn it off at night! Awesome job!
B0042RJWTC|4.0|I am usually not a fan of many things Showtime does but this was a pleasant surprise. This was a good look at history even though some of it is embellished. In the extras they describe some of the embellishments. This was a different portrayal of Henry 8, particularly he is smaller than most would imagine or recall from history books.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|Enjoyed season one, picked this up to get season two as well as one plus all the extras. Great series
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|Was very entertaining although I miss rob Schneider and Sandra bullock. For no name actors not bad. Don't miss sly.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book is one of the most amazing things I have ever read in my entire life.  I don't know much else to say.  It is superb in every way.
B000UZNRS2|5.0|I love how well developed the characters are in this novel.  They are funny, intelligent, interesting &#34;people&#34;, and I'd like to know them in real life!  The story is well told and fun to read, the plot is woven very nicely, and it is a pleasure to pick up a book written by someone with a real talent for writing.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I have really enjoyed this series.  These books are very entertaining and I am looking forward to the movies.  Sweet
B007A4SDCG|5.0|I recommend this book for anyone who wants to go deeper into life and professionalism. Written well and never without the essential humor necessary for getting to the truth about who we are and what we do.
068987474X|4.0|Love the book and Greg's humor. There are some adult themes and foul language. If you push those aside, it is a great book in learning about men and how they will pursue when they are into women.
034580404X|5.0|I got the books on a Friday, and by Monday I had finished them. Read them twice and the second time it was better than the first.
B008K6HN8I|2.0|Seems like this could be very useful on my kindle but I haven't really had the time to get in and use it yet like I would like.
0385343175|5.0|I got this book and started to read it at ounce. But when I got to read it was so romantic and the character of the girl was very interesting and thoughful.
B004D5H2M2|5.0|great great cd to get for you tangerine fans. i cant wait to get the next voulume. go out there and buy it
B004N66XYE|5.0|I loved this series and cannot believe it was discontinued! I am so disappointed there was not more seasons! Downton Abbey has many similarities so I cannot imagine not having more in this series!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I like the game, but I'm stuck. I think there is a glitch. :-/<br />Hope I can reload it and see it through to the end this time.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Another of my top shows! Sheldon is the most funny character I have seen in any TV show. Quality of product was superb, and it arrived even sooner than anticpated via shipping, so that was a plus!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Great app! I was using logmein.com but his is SO much better!! Resolution is outstanding and lag has been minimal.
B009G7ZYPY|3.0|I like this cd but not as well as some of her other cd's. She has a good voice and I'm glad she made it to where she is.
B007SGM084|5.0|I Read all 3 books I was hoping that there would be another 3.  I really enjoyed the book. there was never a dull moment.
B0093OGBL6|1.0|I tried but couldn't get into this book. It was a total waste of my time and the writers time.
B004JXXKWY|4.0|Michael Lewis tells the complex financial story of CDO swaps in a way that is not only immediately approachable, but ultimately compelling. I want his take on every aspect of the world economy.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I loved this movie and loved the books even more. You should read the books and then see the movie or the other way around. Either way they are keepers
B0089EHWQE|5.0|One of the reasons I chose this book is because I can relate somewhat to the story. My brother was in an accident several years ago and became a vent dependent quadriplegic who lived for 10 1/2 years. I know that caregiving for someone with this type of injury is very demanding. My brother was fortunate to have multiple caregivers to assist him. In the story where Clark fell in love with William was heart warming. She loved him for the person he was and not out of pity for him. They built a close relationship from her getting him out to see things he wouldn't have seen otherwise. It was a great tearful love story and I highly recomend this book for anyone.
B000002P6R|3.0|I remember buying this album while I was in college.  I was a big Who fan, then, and I was really disappointed by the album.  I used to have this old turntable, and I'd listen to the record at 45rpm instead of 33rpm, just to get some sort of energy off of it.  The bass was really up front, in that first mix, and the drums sounded like they were following the beat instead of setting it.  I just bought this cd a couple of months ago, and it doesn't soung like it did back then. It is actually listenable and, at times, pleasant.  The sound is crisp and clear, and the bass is back where it belongs.  The drums still sound off, but that may be the drummer.  And, a couple of the songs are pretty weak...but, now that we can hear the songs that almost made the cut, I guess song selection was pretty thin, anyway.
B007TXN4TK|4.0|For the price (free) the Piano Master game is worth it, and it's fun. I would consider a higher grade, later.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Read this and other reviews at [...].<br /><br />Okay, so to say a book changed my life is pretty serious business. This book, though, is serious. The Fault in Our Stars by John Green has changed my life. I couldn't decide if it ruined me. Or fixed me. I've decided to go with fixed me. In all honesty, a series changed my life last year - Fifty Shades of Grey - seems strange, maybe, but it's the truth. It opened me up to this whole other world of books, those independently published, prompted me to write reviews, and therefore start this blog, and since then meet so many amazing people and cultivate amazing friendships.<br /><br />Last spring, I came across The Fault in Our Stars by John Green. I read the synopsis, saw it was getting high praise, and then I chickened out. I couldn't have run faster. Young people. Cancer. No. Way. Generally, I'm a sucker when it comes to subjects like this anyway - I always watch Beaches or Steel Magnolias, but damnit, even though I know what happens, I still can't manage to not lie in the fetal position and snot all over myself.<br /><br />{{\\"That's the thing about pain...it demands to be felt.\\"}}<br /><br />A couple months went by, and I crossed paths with some other avid readers, like myself, all who were SCREAMING for people to read this book. I always felt there was no way I could broach this. My husband's brother passed away in January 2011 (two years ago today, to be exact). My son was 5 weeks old, and it was a horribly dark time. So bittersweet. We had this awesome baby, and then Tim's (my husband) twin brother was dying. I knew reading this story would open up a lot of feelings I remember having in regards to Jeff's cancer, but more importantly to the way it affected my husband and my in-laws. I said at one point, not long after I had Cohen, that I could not ever imagine burying my child. John Green pointed this out for me not far into TFiOS.<br /><br />{{There is only one thing in this world shittier than biting it from cancer when you're sixteen, and that's having a kid who bites it from cancer.}}<br /><br />I fell in love with the characters (all of them), the writing and the story from page one. While I knew it was going to be a sad story, the way that John presented the subject was beautiful. It's amazing how connected to fictional characters you can become, and this was never truer than when reading this story. John was able to lace amazing humor, sarcasm, romance, and HONESTY, so much honesty into this, that it was impossible to put down, even while crying so hard, I couldn't see the screen of my iPad.<br /><br />{{It seemed like forever ago, like we'd had this brief but still infinite forever. Some infinities are bigger than other infinities.}}<br /><br />Yes, as I predicted, this story ripped me open, but it did much more than that. It truly put me back together in way that I didn't realize I was broken. It amazes me how much you can love and learn from people that aren't real. John is a genius. He created these characters that grab you IMMEDIATELY and don't let go. Ever. I finished this over a week ago, and have since found myself re-reading certain parts on numerous occasions. I wasn't even going to review it, to be completely honest, because I knew ^^^ this would occur. Just a whole lot of nonsensical rambling, with some memorable quotes interspersed. I know I'm not doing it justice. And no one can. It just must has to be experienced and felt.<br /><br />{{I want to leave a mark.}}<br /><br />The day after reading this, I crawled into bed with my son (he's 2) and had a long talk with him. He just stared at me, babbled on about the humidifier, his train table and the stars and moon. I knew, though, this story made me think. It gouged out some stuff in me, and hopefully I can be a better version of myself because of it. I was then watching Private Practice and Sheldon (one of the doctors on the show) said something that reminded me so much of this story, and just life in general. And its importance.<br /><br />{{The petty things, they don't matter - the things we argue about and wish we could change about another person: none of that matters. What matters is having someone there to hold your hand if you have cancer.}}<br /><br />Not everyone is so lucky to have that. But many are. I know for my husband, his family found comfort in the fact that Jeff had that. And I know someday I'd have that. It is easy to take for granted, but this book reminded me how important it is to make extra sure NOT to take advantage of this. And of life.<br /><br />I hope that if you're scared to read this, you'll give it a chance. Yes, it's a sad story. But it's more than that. And it deserves to be read for the reasons other than it's sad. Life is sad, sometimes; in fact, a lot of times, life is sad. And unfair. But reading a story like this, reminded me that even in the saddest of moments, for people in the worst circumstances, there's still happiness, and things can be okay. I'm not sure how I'll change my life, but I know it's already changed. And will keep changing.<br /><br />SIDE NOTE TANGENT (again): In John's speaking engagement at Carnegie Hall on Tuesday night he said, the true character of a hero is not being able to go from weakness to strength, but rather strength to weakness. I got goosebumps when he said that and I couldn't possibly agree more - especially when it comes to writing an obituary and the wording of so and so \\"lost his/her battle with cancer\\" -- there is no losing the battle. Fighting it at all is winning, suffering is winning, and being the kind of hero that lives through this is NEVER losing the battle.<br /><br />Unfortunately Cohen never got to meet Jeff because of all sorts of crappy circumstances at the end. But we know that he's left his mark and Cohen will know just great his Uncle Jeff was. It's nice that today, of all days, I've finally gotten this review up and written and it can serve to be a great remembrance of him.<br /><br />You don't get to know how long you'll be here for, but never underestimate your mark on the world.<br /><br />Oh - and in case I didn't make myself clear - read this book.<br /><br />Okay?

B009YP9L7U|4.0|It is a book that keeps you ready, but the plot could be better. Wouldn't really recommend to others as a \\"must read\\" book.
0446554995|5.0|I love Preston & Child books. I love the authors when they write alone. This book was refreshing in that it took me longer to read it which I enjoyed. A nice thick book requiring a slow steady pace. The mystery was there as well. Pendergast's character was given a more balanced feel to it. Finding out he and his wife's surprise was awesome. Then to see & hear more about them. I am glad that Pendergast now has a reason to show us more sides of his character in future books. And the little tidbit dropped on us at the end regarding D'agosta will also give us more for the future. I enjoyed the book for many reasons and look forward to more books from these two authors!

B001AQO3WY|1.0|I am appalled at the marines who's comments are that the series is real to their life experience  saying oh man this is so real and that's how it was... To belittle kids letters to army personal they are supporting them only to have the marines talking about f..king them, the racism is disgusting on their part not to mention their ignorance ...these military people are representing the American people abroad no wonder we get attacked from all sides. Ed Burns is a master at making a series that is true to form for him I give 5 stars but for the people it portraits its not good at all in fact disgusting

B007S3S8HO|3.0|I got this product for my six (nearly seven) year old nephew and we spent an evening putting it together.  The directions left much to be desired as they were really nothing more than a vague picture with no real step-by-step directions at all.  It was a bit advanced for someone of his age.  As an adult I had to study it and really contemplate what it was instructing us to do at times.  We spent about an hour building it all straight out of the box, but my nephew loved every minute of it.  It was a great education experience for him to, to watch it all come together and think about which piece was going to connect with another in what sequence.  Once we started getting into it he could recognize the patterns and already handed me the next piece before I even had to tell him what it was.  At the end he had a real sense of accomplishment that we had built this thing together, from scratch, on our own.<br /><br />But I will say the end result is rather flimsy.  Bear in mind that it may start to fall apart before you even want it to.  And it felt pretty anticlimactic to spend an hour building it and literally one second knocking it all to pieces just to have to reassemble it all again.  My main complaint is with the stability.  I wish there was some way you could knock down the pigs without totally annihilating the entire structure and require an extensive rebuild just for one second's worth of fun.  The hit of the night was simply the slingshot used to propel the birds, which really doesn't even require the structure.  It's much easier to just set the pigs on a desktop or nearby table.  So it can be fun, but be prepared to work for your fun!
B0076DELIG|4.0|I enjoyed the BOOK , but not his best.  The ending was hard to believe.  I will still read his next BOOK.
B0067LY4WG|5.0|I actually bought this CD after attending a recent Leonard Cohen concert as it contains a lot of the songs he performed that night. It will be a reminder of Mr. Cohen's talented performance that evening for years to come.

0345803485|5.0|I have only made it into the first chapter of this one. I can not wait to find out how it ends!! I love the Grey's Trilogy!!
B0058VW36U|1.0|This game is a piece of s*** it sucks it doesn't even open on my kindle never buy this game it sooooooooooo bad!!!!
1449410243|5.0|This book is so funny- we could not put it down!! I bought it as a gift for a Veterinarian friend of mine- and all of us at the office got a kick out of it!!!!
0345479092|4.0|Loved the book! Was very helpful.  My baby would not sleep easily neither at night nor during the day... what do you do with a 3 week old that only sleeps a very short nap in the morning?  Her methods helped me as a first-time mom.
0345803507|5.0|What else can I say- these books are amazing! A must read. Sexual romantic experience. Buy all 3 at once, once you start, you won't be able to put them down!!
B004A2U4V4|5.0|It is Bon Jovi what more is there to say - he put his best songs on this album, it is the best ever!
0345803493|5.0|Great book! I love this one better than the first! A must have for any Grey's fan!! Great buy! Excellent!
0399226907|5.0|With all of the good foods in this book to eat, no wonder the caterpillar got so big!  This is a wonderful book for your pre-readers, babies, and toddlers.  Although I do not care for Eric Carle's style, my children like it. My daughter really loved reading this book for a long time.
B007R41E8O|3.0|I was having a really great time for awhile and the story seemed to be building an interesting plot. Then it dragged through the middle because there were a lot (a LOT) of steps between clues and tools. When I finally got to where the story seemed to be on the verge of revealing itself and what the hell was going on, I thought, &quot;how could they possibly explain everything and how am I going to get rid of all of the stuff I still have.&quot; Then I finally made a big move and all of the sudden, it was over.<br /><br />I'm still not sure what that was all about. It's still a mystery without an explanation. I wanted to go back and see what I had missed, but the game had already reset. It was a lot of work without any payoff.<br /><br />Otherwise, although the game shut down on me a couple of times, it was pretty easy to recover. Overall, aside from the long awaited, yet abrupt and unenlightening ending, the game was well designed with good puzzles and it kept me in it until it spit me out.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Wonderful book! Couldn't put it down! Loved the characters, the way it was written, I didn't want it to end!<br />Highly recommended!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Simply loved it.  Uplifting, heartbreaking, and all around enjoyable.  Very excited to see the movie now that I've read the book.
B006JD48NM|4.0|A basic summary of Senna Racing. Just enough to make it interesting, There was a lot more to his life, but this runs down the basics, makes you want just a little more
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|Real fun . Reminds me of demigod :D also really addictive y could make the characters a lil cheaper but  it's cool y guys gotta eat... right :)
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|Love the show and how special to be able to listen to the music.  Have the CD in my car and listen to it every day.  Hope there will be another CD after winter season.
B0048IMZMG|5.0|I think Taylor Swift is the best and I was so happy to have this CD through amazon mp3 download. It's really easy to use and once I installed it to my computer it automatically went to my itunes library.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Love this game - just wish I had more time on the clock (at least another 30 seconds) a minute just goes toooo fast!
B001KPK6Q2|5.0|I really love this CD from Taylor Swift. The cost of this was also great. I'm really glad I discovered amazon's mp3 selection.
B0006IUDXA|5.0|MacGyver is an awesome tv series and my family and I really enjoy watching it. His adventures are so crazy!
B006WWUDGQ|5.0|I love all of her CDs'. I love that amazon has a better price than itunes for Taylor Swift's CD.
B004P7CNE0|3.0|This is a rather decent SF movie although it is overly long.  There's gun-kata which is pretty cool looking choreography.  I love the Toshiro Mifune action at the end.  (Sometimes less is more.)  There are all kinds of comparisons to the body of previous SF work.  (I especially enjoyed seeing an echo of the old classic 1984 Apple computer commercial.)  Much of the social and political content is worth thinking about.<br /><br />But much of the first three quarters of the film was tedious.  There were a lot of small filler pieces that didn't really advance the plot so much as get in one's face with, \\"we're not sure you get it yet so we're going to drop another scene in here to repeat ourselves.\\"  I guess when the premise of a movie is that the main character has no emotion for the first half, character development and the audience's bond with that character is going to be a bit challenging.  Still, why does the gradual return of emotions have to be so gradual and (let's say) linear?  Why not an intense emotional spike earlier in the movie to hook us in a little more?  The scenes with the puppy were laughable and wildly out of place.<br /><br />I think 30 minutes could have been chopped out and replaced with more material dealing with the main subject of a society without feelings.  What motivates those in control of society if there are no emotion?  But I suspect that there is a contradiction in the plot that undermines it.  Totalitarian societies gain control because they exploit feelings - not repress them.  Totalitarian societies need expertly managed emotion.  Well it's Hollywood so the safest bet ever is that it will have a happy ending.  It's so nice that the risk-adverse, formulaic entertainment conglomerates let us get to cheer on the rebellion at the end.  Or are they just toying with our emotions?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The best for my kindle fire<br />My favorite games<br />Long game at none stop<br />For my all kids and friends
B000LC55F2|5.0|After loaning my first copy of this movie to a friend I decided to get another copy.  The dvd was exactly as promised and VERY CHEAP!  It also arrived early.  I love shopping using Amazon!!
B008OOYALE|5.0|This is a great game .  I can not believe it was free . Somehow, I bred a firestorm dragon with a island dragon and got a diamond dragon. WEIRD BUT AMAZING. Suggest for anyone.
B0091QSNEE|3.0|Very cute game. I just wish there were more recipes available. My daughter is 4 and completed all of the recipes in 30 minutes. She loves the app,  but keeps asking me to find more food.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Great. And free!<br /><br />Honestly you have to get this .  You do not have to buy things tat is only if you want to hurry.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Perfect app for information on weather. Like that it gives up to date information as well as information 15 days in advance. Has radar. Information also. This is a great opportunity all the st around!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I loved this game because it challenges me to use my brain to find out the correct answer to this line puzzle! I would recommend it to anyone who loves a challenge. Watch yourself get frustrated on the hard levels and time trial. Worth being downloaded!!
0071762345|5.0|What could I possibly add to the over 200 positive reviews of this book?<br /><br />Let me mention one thing: while still reading it, I felt the urge to immediately add buttons for Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter on my ExploringGeopolitics website. What more can I say?<br /><br />Therefore, a highly convincing (and recommendable) read!
B004HD61KE|5.0|I love novels based on history. This book kept me glued to it.  I think it has a little of something for everyone who loves mysteries. I'm a first time reader of JAMES ROLLINS, but this book won't be my last.
B002Y5FKUE|5.0|A very fine  modern production of bellinis work. With two of the best singers at thid time, it gives you a very plecent experience
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Great music, great talent.  Playing standard instruments is non standard ways making far above standard music.  Then some of the best YouTube videos to boot!
B0063IH60K|5.0|App works great on my kindle, and it's for free so why wouldn't you own it? I recommend this app to everyone!
B004D9FLJE|5.0|I think Glee is one of those love-it-or-hate-it phenomena. Personally, I love it, as does my daughter, so we had to get this for my mother for Christmas. Now she's hooked too. Guess I better buy the rest of them!
B0076DEJMO|5.0|Well written and good to the end. Follows along with the original storyline. You end up hating someone you may have loved from before.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|If you like putt putt you will love this. The obstacles and the gadgets make it super interesting and challenging. Fun to just open and play a quick game or spend hours trying beat them all.
0807014273|5.0|Excellent book.  One of those rare books that really made me think and I hope changed me.  I will keep this book and reread it from time to time.  I hope I never forget the lessons I learned from reading it.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|What might have been a fun premise is horribly let down by the poorest literary style I've read in ages.<br />If I were to offer the author only one tip it would be: Show us what your characters are feeling through your descriptions instead of telling us.<br /><br />And that's leaving the grammar issues aside - avoid this dreck at all costs!
1452110581|5.0|This little books has many amusing poems and some that are touching.  The writer is very astute as to the attitude of cats.
B00AOMR2S2|5.0|If you're a fan of Glee and/or like this movie, this album is a DEFINITE buy!  My wife harassed me to buy this non-stop after seeing the movie, and now I listen to it almost as much as she does, lol
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I would recommend this book. The author being a surgeon gives a real good account of the brain and of a near death experience.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I hated the repetitive phrases and how it seemed like a high school girl wrote this in her secret notebook alone in her room. I probably will buy the rest of the trilogy with the hopes that maybe there will be more substance. I feel like the last few pages of this book for really interesting and I got very invested in it, but then it just ended, leaving me disappointed.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read in my entire life. A must read for everyone, a page turner you can't put down...
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I at least do not have the complaints some of the Nook people seem to have with their cables and chargers.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I have every season of this show, it is great. The show is funny, intelligent, and endearing. I ordered this copy for my brother for Christmas. He loved it. It arrived quickly and in factory sealed perfect condition.
B008XG1X18|5.0|They have so many original ideas!  My girls love it too!  Gives us gift ideas, recipes and just helpful hints around the house!
B009UZBLSG|5.0|Worked like a charm with my Nexus 4, just plugged it in and my TV picked it up right away.
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|BEST EVER BREAK UP CD OR JUST PISSED WITH YOUR MAN YOU CAN JAM OUT TO THIS lol... US CHICKS GOTTA LET IT OUT SOME HOW!!!
1400064627|5.0|One of the best novels I've ever read. Way better than the movie, and the movie is one of my favorite films of all time. If you're even slightly curious about learning more about Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe, you should read this. I found it riveting and emotional and just all around a gorgeous book. Definitely going to read it again.
B006R1T40I|4.0|The delivery and price were great.<br />Like Bonny loud!! not my favorite  CD<br />but it is still good. Like her old stuff the best.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|Great sitcom. Sheldon is amazing, his facial expressions , body language and chemistry with the cast.  He cracks me up every episode . LOL funny.  Good light hearted comedy ... Like the laughs from cheers and Seinfeld.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This is an amazing series...the fashion is fabulous and the story lines and characters are amazing.  I look forward to every new show that comes on TV in season 3.
B00AJLHUYO|5.0|I've seen it all, nothing really scares me but this movie got the job done. Actually screamed out loud in the theatre.
B007DIQC90|5.0|I learned about these guys from Paul Krugman of all people. I hate his taste in music, but I check out his recommendations as an attempt to broaden myself. Nanna and Ragnar's odd but delightful voices had me hooked from the beginning. Then I watched the video for 'Little Talks' and was instantly transformed into a fanboy.<br /><br />I'm sure many people will dismiss this music as unserious, but these days when people say 'serious' they usually just mean 'mopy'. Fun is its own kind of serious and Of Monsters and Men do it brilliantly. I've frequently seen them compared to Mumford and Sons, and Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeroes - two bands which I can barely stand thirty seconds at a time. So please don't be guided by those comparisons<br /><br />Personally Of Monsters and Men put me more in mind of Feist or Regina Spektor - artists I love. That's not any kind of intellectual analysis, just my own emotional/esthetic response. Still if you enjoy either of those artists maybe you should check these guys out. There are I think literally dozens of videos of the band in performance to be found, so it's easy to preview them.
B000FC10WU|5.0|after seeing on pbs the &#34;body in the library&#34; done<br />at least once or twice , its nice to read each word<br />you might of missed while watching the show;<br />sometimes i'm so enthralled with the clothes<br />makeup and hair styles, i miss the &#34;clues&#34;.<br />always fun to read and dig into a good book and<br />God knows Agatha is one of the best.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book, the characters and the story...I laughed out loud and even shed a tear.  I could not put this book down
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I really like this game. It is addictive and really challenges the brain. I can do this for hours and wonder where the time went.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|I bought this app for my kindle fire to replace a calculator. Does everything I need . I highly recommend it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun game. I have always enjoyed this game. A good way to pass the time for a few minutes and you can sometimes win.
1932735410|5.0|I am not good at memorizing and I am not good at tests. I took about 7 months to prepare for the PMP exam, which I passed.<br /><br />My approach:<br />1) I read through [[ASIN:B0064U8GF6 Head First PMP]]. This gave me a good idea. It is easy to understand too.<br />2) Then I read through Rita's book. This was my first reality check. Wow. This was going to be a lot tougher than I thought after going through this. Each chapter, it felt as if she was standing right behind me (she will call you out to wake you up!).  The practice areas, the suggestions, and practice questions are spot on.<br />3) I read both books as the layout generally matches. I went through both books for a total of 4 times each. I took lots of notes and also wrote down the questions I got wrong.<br />4) I did [[ASIN:111816976X PMP Practice Makes Perfect: Over 1000 PMP Practice Questions and Answers]] though I think Rita's question software would have been just as good.<br />5) I also did a lot of online questions. Google Oliver Lehman's pmp questions. Do these plus at the bottom of the page he has a link to more questions. Do the ones where he mentions HARD. This was another reality check for me.<br /><br />Could I have passed this test with just Rita's book? I think you probably could but I would still suggest you do the online questions.<br /><br />One thing about Rita's book that is lacking is not enough Cost Management formula questions. They say you shouldn't worry. I thought I'd be ok, I memorized these formulas and I did these types of questions over and over in various situations but it wasn't enough. Get some more practice (head first was better than Rita's on cost mgmt). Also look into CoQ too. I think I saw another review that mentioned this point too.<br /><br />Study hard. Treat your preparation as a project. Take lots of notes. Keep taking practice exams. Cover the answers for the questions, see if your answers match the choices available. Study daily (I did 3 hours daily) and alwaysreview your notes daily.<br /><br />The test takes longer than you think too. I had 5 minutes left by the time I went through all the questions once but when I was practicing at home, I finished the test in 2.5 hrs. I thought I would have heaps of time to review. wow.<br /><br />When you take the test, think of Rita standing behind you giving you a good slap to keep you alert. She is awesome. I hope there will be an eighth edition that covers PMBOK 5th.
B0063GORYU|5.0|My wife loves this game. It is probably her favorite. She has played it for years and never gets tired of it.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Isaacson provides a well written and very interesting look at the life and career of Steve Jobs.  I found it to be an easy read.  I bookmarked many pages that provided interesting insights on a very complex person. Jobs could be a zealous visionary, passionate innovator, and effective manager. He could also be narcissistic, arrogant and neurotic.  Over the years, we've seen snippets of Jobs in the media, but this book helps to understand the man and his accomplishments.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|It's a lot of fun but if u play it all the time it gets boring they do have really cute pets I love the Dalmatians they are totes adorable the game is fun just don't play it all the time I would recommend this to some one who loves animals it's great really
B006CQLGXG|5.0|It's a classic, the illustrations in it are wonderful. Even if you know the story by heart, It's a must read for the holiday season.
B00006CXXU|5.0|love this album. the beat rocks. her voice is fantastic. if you like the &#34;early&#34; Christina aguilera, this one is for you.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is addictive.  My boyfriend and I love to rag on the aristocrats.  It is worth watching Season 1 and 2 first.
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|This movie was a complete dumpster fire. Not that I dislike Karl Urban, they just didn't seem to ask him to act, he was simply there with a few throaty growled words every now and then, and shooting at stuff.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I enjoyed this book more than a 4, but not quite a 5.  Sparks's books are a little formulaic, but are good romances if that's what you are in the mood to read.
B000002A46|4.0|Nice Christmas CD, loved most of the songs. Hopefully they will all grow on me over time but still nice to have.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I loved how the lead characters were interrelated all along.  No matter the abuse or the harm that they suffered, it just goes to show how love can win out if we let it and heal us if we overcome fear of our vulnerability.  I love flowers and often keep fresh ones littered throughout my home.  This book is spot on as to how they make a difference in moods.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I found that this game is very nice game for us (parents) and children, we spend interesting time with it.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|One of the best books I've read in many years. I can't wait to get started on the second book.
B000I5X824|5.0|I'm a big staind fan and this item was shipped to me very fast! This cd is a good compilation of their best songs.
B009YU6FJM|5.0|I have been a Deftones fan for over a decade and often refer to them as my favorite one at that.  The last 2 albums before this one were good but they left me a bit puzzled.  Koi No Yokan is definitely what I'm looking for in the Deftones.  Every track is worth hearing, as most their albums offer.  My favorites are Swerve City, Goon Squad, Leathers, and of course Tempest.  And if you're looking for the closest sounding thing since White Pony, in my opinion, this is it!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|By far, one of the best books I have read in years.  I didn't expect that I would be forced to critique my place in life ...on this earth, as a father , son, and brother when page one was turned.  Thank you!!
B0097HSS4M|3.0|I Had trouble a couple of times trying to get on the photo editor , seem to have cleared up.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I like this story.  Sometimes I got a little lost.  I read a lot of books and very fast.  If it doesn't connect with me at the very beginning I have a hard time staying with it.  This one kept me going until the end.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I loved this book.  Wonderful story full of emotion.  I love it when a writer captures more than one emotion, this story made me laugh, made me want to reach in and smack the guy, and got me all teary eyed.
B00AP5Z2F8|5.0|I suppose you could take a weekend or two and go through all the various features of the HERO 3 and figure out what settings work best. This guide book is a quick read stuffed full with tons of details and tips. I think it's a total bargain for the information it has. The HERO 3 is an AWESOME camera and it has so many settings. The book explains when and why to set the camera up at a certain aspect ratios and shutter speeds, as well as angles, lighting and then editing your footage. And I really found the anti-fogging techniques extremely helpful. I wish I had known about them with my HERO and HERO 2 cameras. Fog is a constant problem in the water. If I have just one complaint, I wish the author had talked a little more about the WiFi features (which again, are super cool!). It would have been nice if he had given a few interesting examples of how to use the WiFi. It's just a minor quibble because the WiFi capabilities is the one thing I love experimenting with. Still, the book is an excellent reference guide.
0143057189|2.0|the picture led me to believe that this was the CD set that I was listening to from the library.<br />It may be my own fault that i didn't pay attention when ordering that I bought a condensed version.<br />Be careful if buying this that you don't buy this disappointing set.
B001HN6EF4|5.0|I really like how fast these cards shipped. I got them in two days.  The clear plastic cards are durable and fit on the clip ring. I used to own these years ago and lost them.  I thought I would never be able to find these again.  So when I looked on Amazon and located these, I purchased them immediately.  They are the only uno cards I will ever buy. Once again, Go Amazon!!!
B001OQCV2E|5.0|Awesome visual effects, gripping story, and on the edge movie worth seeing on the big screen.  On DVD, it has nice color and detail already.  I bet on bluray, it's mind blowing clear.
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|The best of British historical drama. Cast, direction, setting and cinematography are first class. It is an excellent insight into the life and troubles that beset the British aristocracy in the early part of the 20th century.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|This movie falls under my favorites alongside Independence Day and Apollo 13.  It's clever to isolate the main characters and most of the fight under a shield.  Is that movie economics or just plain smart story writing?  Either way, it worked.  I did not miss the rest of the messy fight like transformer.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|The best of British historical drama. The cast, direction, setting and cinematography are first class. I thoroughly enjoy this series.
B00005JMXX|5.0|The acting was superb.  The storyline was good and believable.  Devastation was global making it very convincing that this can really happen.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is the best one so far for me,  especially since I love, absolutely LOVE horses but I don't have one.. I LOVEEEEEEEE ITTTTTTT
B005CRQ4GU|2.0|This is a great deal to be able to get to know about the new book<br />Dairy of a wimpy kid is a great book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is so awesome!  I absolutely fell in love with minecraft when I got it for my computer, so when I saw this for the kindle fire...  I HAD to get it.  So far I absolutely have loved it, I have no complaints, and I absolutely love it.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Bone Bed was great and kept me interested and looking for more. Patricia as always is great. I want more
B000NA28I4|4.0|Well done.  Convincing for it's genre and venue of appeal.<br /><br />Children or casual-adult selection is a winner as good wins out.<br /><br />This movie was never intended to be an all-star \\"beyond belief\\" sort of adventure thriller.<br /><br />With this in mind, shame on all the spoiled 1-star voters, lusting for perfection in all their boredom.  Probably welfare brats with no IQ to speak of.<br /><br />Nice little adventure.  Enjoy.
B006RXPUR2|5.0|I could not stop thinking about this movie long after I'd finished watching it. Who's right and who's wrong? A great cast and Casey Affleck is great.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Very entertaining and captivating book. Keeps you in suspense!<br />I can not wait for the movie to come out in February!
630522577X|5.0|Great movie!  Our family loves old musicals.  This one is so heart warming.  Takes you away to another day and time when things were simpler.
B005DZMODI|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums.  Eric Clapton and Wynon Marsalis together.  Pure joy.  Gave it to my 17 year old grandson who likes it as much as I.
0765325950|1.0|After 23 years and 15 books (lest we forget \\"New Spring\\"), I have demonstrated immense loyalty to this series. This has made the final installment seem particularly insulting.  Nothing about it is epic except the sheer number of pages. There are some flashes which harken back to the strength of the series, for example the story arc of Pevara/Androl and that of Talmanes.  However, the majority are blathering twaddle - neither meaningfully expanding on a character nor elucidating an insightful truth about the human condition. The fault lies with the editing more than anything.  Had the Perrin/Slayer narrative been edited properly, it would have been half as long, and as a result, more than twice as exciting.  A criminal number of pages were wasted, all leading to a rushed, underwritten final few chapters.  Lastly and certainly not least, the confrontation between Rand and the Dark One was beyond juvenile.  It lacked both the scope and depth which Mr. Jordan's long-time readers deserved.  Those who stopped reading around books 5-8 made the right call.  Alas.
B003V1WXKU|5.0|It's amazing to get an inside perspective of a genius, and how he isn't all that different from the rest of us.
B001AUEMFS|5.0|Makes you stop and think deeply about life and love and why you were made, every time you hear it.  It makes you think you have a greater calling in life.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett has lived up to his name.  This book is such a great history lesson as well as a great read.  If you liked Fall of Giants you will love Winter of the World.  I will anxiously await the final book in the Century Trilogy.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I love minecraft. I play it with my cousins all the time. the problem is when I go to download it it finishes loading then crashes while its finishing we called amazon and they said it actually a POPULAR problem. so before you buy this app think about that.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|A fine yarn well spun. I'm a Grisham fan and this story did not disappoint in any way.  I think a visit to Antigua should be on my bucket list.
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|I really loved this game at first. The animals are adorable, the graphics are awesome, and it's fun. However, it's ridiculous how the game is an obvious money trap. I won't pay a cent for games or apps, period. You can only get certain animals (like the Panda) by spending money to buy peanuts. They make it increasingly more ridiculously expensive to add on space at the higher levels. WORST of all, as others mentioned, when I got to Level 22, this game ENTIRELY CRASHED my Kindle Fire HD. ENTIRELY. I had to do a factory restore and I LOST EVERYTHING on my Kindle. This game is NOT WORTH IT! Do yourself a favor and AVOID it. I wish I had!
B005C6HGSG|4.0|It was good followed the show to a T. Highly recommended if you are a supernatural fan. It felt like I was watching an episode only reading it!
B005LAIIJY|5.0|...you've come to the right place. Tarantino's latest genre mash-up really delivers. I'd say it's his best, but who knows what's next?!
B009YQJ322|5.0|I watch bad \\"genre' movies all the time.  I'm familiar with the license to a degree and have seen the stallone version.  This was actually a really well done movie.  Very violent but seemingly legitimate to the source material.  I think the other (female) judge was miscast.  I get the dynamic that's supposed to be in place (soul-less judge interacting with someone seemingly sympathetic to the people she's supposed to judge and how they change each other over the course of the movie) but it seems ham-fisted and the female judge seems a little loopy for this material/world.<br /><br />It's decent for the budget and for the most part takes place in an apartment building (a big one) probably for that reason.  But it's good for what it is.  Doesn't really have a point or go anywhere though but I suppose that's just the nature of these popcorn flicks.
B00381A1MU|4.0|These are a gift to a 3 year old boy. I am sure he will like them, but I haven't given to him yet.
B00B19DMUE|4.0|Among horror fans there are those that seek out films with a supernatural or demonic flare, and this movie fits snugly in that category, while still bringing something new to the table. The true-life events and lore of the \\"box\\" that this film is based upon are almost as disturbing as the film itself, and I personally think that adds to the potency of the movie experience. Some may say that this film mimics the exorsist too much and uses the \\"box\\" as a gimmick, but I think it definitely stands on it's own merits.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I play this game all the time!  It is challenging, fun and makes you think.  I think this would be a great game for kids too.
B001I8A76A|5.0|This album has several of Pink's radio released songs on it. Includes Glitter in the Air and Sober. Great cd if you're a fan of Pink.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|I finished both seasons in less than a week.  The acting is perfect and the set could not be better.
B00A14SQBU|2.0|I am a vocal man, so I have always admired Christinas vocals but somewhere down the line she lost sight of fun music, why is it that everyone today is putting together albums that you have to listen to a hundred times and say what the hell does this song mean, during my era of music it was pretty simple...Journey...Lovin',Touchin', Squeezin', pretty simple huh. Def Leppard...Pour Some Sugar On Me, no college classes to figure out what any of those songs were about! And I guess it is a necessity to have explicit language on every album now.
B007BLCGNU|5.0|A must see. Leonardo DiCaprio was a superb actor. Kept you entranced and interested throughout the movie. True to era.
B00A3AUGEW|4.0|This is a good album, plain and simple, one of those albums where every song doesn't sound the same, he is going to be something big in music with his incredible range of material.
B008RC72G8|5.0|loved it, I'm a fan of Johnny and never did get to watch the original tv series, truly like the movie
B009738XXM|3.0|Bought this album for my niece, gave it a listen and it kind of grew on me, I am an 80's metal fan so I had to really bear down to listen to this. I have to say that it grew on me, can't really tell you why but I listen to it quite frequently now.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Awesome and extremely handy app. It does more then I could dreaming and helps me determine how my battery is being used.
B009RROP12|5.0|Anyone who knows Jimi Jamison music knows that he rarely writes or produces a bad song, from solo to Survivor to collaborations with singer/songwriters like Kimball he always makes good music and this album is no different. Just fun music to listen to, nothing depressing, no misery, no negative undertones...JUST ROCK AND ROLL!
1451695195|5.0|Proof of Heaven is well written, deeply reasurring and profound. It opened my heart to what is possible. Simply a must read.
B003GYEGNO|4.0|Even though this was written 30 years ago, i still found it fascinating.  As a Brit, i was amazed and aghast at the portrayal of the diifferent strata of NY society.  i found the law process intriguing and the corruption, resentment, the 'favor' system, the deals, the violence, all interesting and valid.  The plot is secondary to the process , but i did enjoy the fall from grace that Kramer and the accused man suffered.  Of course, Bacon and the girl, the most corrupt 'won'  T'was ever thus.
B00846REIS|3.0|The story was too predictable.I would have liked more erotiIc moments.  I read the second one, but I don't believe that I'll read the third one.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I could not put this book down! It was such an awesome love story along with having an awesome story line that had some very surprising twists that I did not expect! A definite must read!
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|I have a pretty low bar as far as movies go, but this film was just terrible!  Bad plot, bad acting, everything was awful.  Total waste of time.

B007SGLZP8|3.0|I kept hoping this book would go somewhere. It seemed to go on forever with unbelievable scenarios. Ho hum. But what do I know.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I couldn't put it down.  It is disturbing, perhaps because the issue is so timely right now.  It calls into question so much about what we think we know about ourselves, our children, our friends, our marriages, our career choices, and how these all interact when the unexpectedly tragic occurs. Character development is right up there with plot development.  Eager to read more of Landay.
0553593544|4.0|This was a great book  !!!! ,! ,!! ,! !!! ,!  I gave it as a gift and they loved it .
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|This is one of those real life stories that truly drags your soul down to the unbelievable evil and cruelty that man can force upon another human being.  I wept through many pages for this young man and counted myself blessed beyond words for a loving family and daily affection from those that know how to show love.  Well worth reading because it has so many lessons of life and reminds us that life isn't so great for many around the world.  I would recommend this book to anyone 13 and older.
B004JN1D2I|3.0|If you love the hobbit and played alot of dungeon and dragons as a kid you'll probably be into this.
B000UX6THK|5.0|I never watched the show before. I was enthralled with this series. More than worth the price! A sequel someday?
B005FJ7F7M|5.0|Enjoyed this movies it was very entertaining and hope to find titles like this in the future.. Thank you very much..
B0076DELIG|5.0|A good Harry Bosch mystery, and it kept my interest going.  As I got to the last few chapters, I couldn't put it down.
B009CPIR9K|5.0|Enjoyed this movies it was very entertaining and hope to find titles like this in the future.. Thank you very much..
B005GRF2UK|5.0|This version of Jane Eyre is my favorite because of it's beautiful soundtrack. It is also just a good version overall--acting and storyline are all good.
B00009P1MP|5.0|This was a must-add for my digital music library. This song from my era that has always been a favorite, partly because I also remember the incident that inspired it.  I am by no means a professional music critic, but this is one of the top tunes on my nostalgia list.  I believe many others of my generation agree.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Jodi has the capability to make the story very real and I was living it my self; did not want to out it down!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Very good<br />I loved it I Will read this many more times to come :)<br />Everyone that I know hehe
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This is an amazing movie from start to finish a true classic. Christopher Nolan captures perfectly Batman's rise from defeat to save Gotham one last time before hanging up the cape and passing it on
B002JWD6AS|5.0|Totally the world's best book EVER!!!! It's so much more different than other books I have read but that's what makes it special. Maggie Stiefvater has caught my attention completely.
B008XKSW7M|2.0|I thought this was going to be a really good movie & that I would think it was so funny. I was disappointed by it though. All the funny scenes in the movie I had already watched in the trailers for it. Maybe it's funnier to someone who is actually pregnant or has been pregnant but to me, it just wasn't good.
B004S5N7T4|5.0|Great story. Just love Peter Robinson and his very understated English Inspector Banks. Characters are always believable and the story has many twists
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This has been one of the best books I have ever read!!  I love the author's writing style!! Definitely recommend this book for those who belong to a book club!!!
B004NOH9LC|4.0|I expected the subject matter (morning television news) would mean some shallowness, and I was not disappointed. While the pace was sufficient to keep things moving along, in the end this story did not engage me with its characters. A pleasant enough way to spend two hours (at least I don't want them back).
B008CPZNL6|5.0|I began with Pulse and thought I would never change. Then a Pulse update rearranged all my categories and I decided to try something else. Flipboard has all the pulse news sources and a lot more. Now I will not return to pulse.
B00005N6KG|3.0|The description is accurate, these are definitely lightweight headphones. I picked them up for when I am watching videos or listening to music on my computer. The sound quality is good and they are comfortable to wear. My chief complaint is the length of the cord; it is very short and I had to pick up an audio extension cable to prevent the cord from draping across my keyboard during use.
B000076CY6|5.0|The product was great, my nephew was thrilled.  The only issue was the delivery.  The box was not sealed on the bottom and due to the rain we where having the actual lego box was soaked.  I had to use a hair dryer to get it dry, I am glad that the legos are plastic and in plastic bags.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game takes time, I was amazed that this was free! I am sure some people would agree with me, you can be really active with the game in the beginning but then it slows you down but I guess that's a good thing sort of but you can battle around the world &amp; win or lose doesn't matter witch really but you improve your army &amp; earn money no improve even more! I love this developer he is amazing so far as I know if you get this game ENJOY!
1476719071|4.0|I'll begin by saying the following: if you're not a hardcore romance fan, you will NOT enjoy this book. It's as if it was written by a high school student and edited by a blind chimpanzee. At times, there are entire chunks of sentences missing and I had to go back and reread thinking to myself \\"what the?!?!\\" HOWEVER...and it's a big however...the pure passion and jealousy and adolescent obsession in this book had me all steamy!!!! The main characters are both so darn likeable. They've got their amazing little quirks and personalities and you just get sucked in from the very first chatper. Not since 50 Shades volume 2 have I finished a book in less than 24 hours. I simply could NOT put it down. I was a bit dissapointed with the \\"bleh\\" ending. Don't want to spoil it, but I felt it could have had a bit more oomph. So...4 stars for a bland ending and pi$$ poor editing! Still a really great read, and you should totally pick it up and be prepared for hot posessive/dominant male sexiness!
B00942S4OY|5.0|The CD arrived quickly and was packaged well.  Both my sons and daughters enjoy their music!  It has a nice selection of songs.
B002JIEYLM|5.0|Even though this record is at the end of Sabbath's great run with Ozzy, being a solid Sabbath fan, I love it. This is a remastered version, and does sound much cleaner than the original. Not a bad song on the record.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Like that it us open play as compared to the set tasks of other versions but I wish some items opened faster, especially environmental improvement items
0307730697|5.0|Adam truly was a role model for husbands and fathers everywhere. He lived his life to the fullest and made a positive impact on everyone around him. I admired his relationship with God and his example really inspires me to be a better husband and father.<br />Wonderful story!
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Can't get enough of this show.  Watching an entire season at once makes you go crazy waiting for the next season to start.
B009MF56GC|4.0|I enjoyed this movie alot. The pic and sound a fabulous! Theres so much action and violence, which I love in an action flick! But don't let it go your head. it's just a movie!
B001DDBCUA|4.0|For a die-hard fan, this is a worthwhile purchase at the right price.<br /><br />The movie itself is GREAT (the sequel, unfortunately, leaves a lot to be desired). But, if you're looking for big sweeping changes in the Widescreen edition, you won't find any. Not that I can see, anyhow. I'm a Sex and the City fan who owns the series collection (velvety pink packaging). However, I've owned the Full Screen version and don't see a noticeable difference in Widescreen, though I have a fairly large HDTV hooked up to my DVD player.<br /><br />Additionally - like the series collection - I wish the Special Features were more interesting. I'm proud of Michael Patrick King's accomplishments, but I'd rather see and hear from the stars themselves. All of them. There are no deleted scenes, alternate endings or cast member interviews here. Just the option to watch the movie alongside King's commentary, which I don't even like listening to as I watch the TV episodes on DVD (his delivery seems impersonal when pitted against the very intimate views we get of the girls' lives and loves).<br /><br />Make your own decision, but know that you may not get much more than you did with Full Screen.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Gets the mind working.  Trying to solve every one in record times.  Love those math/logic puzzles.<br />The kids love it too.
B0090EJ99A|2.0|Don't expect too much from this movie. Even so, it's not as funny as the trailers made it appear. Wait for it to appear on cable tv.
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|Not as good as season 1, season 1 was addictive from the first chapter, this one seems to be a little slower; and watching some of the same actors from S1 playing different characters it kind of throw you off.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This is a very interesting story and it has some good lesson to learn for children, or even adult! Disney has done it again!
B000FCK65W|5.0|I was introduced to this book by a movie on TCM with the same name. The book is different from the movie in some of the character portrayals and chronology. The character portrayals are excellent because the poverty mentality is so real to life - some thrive, some overachieve, and some grow bitter. There is an alcoholic father. The reader gets to see him differently through the eyes of each character. Very well written. No sex or violence. No unpleasant graphic detail. For a real experience of the beauty of this story, read the book AND watch the movie. Can't say enough!!!
0763619612|5.0|Its another great book for anyone who has an artist in their family or anyone who likes to read. Thumbs up!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Infinite replayability, tons of stuff to unlock, and it's only a buck! Couple that with expansion viruses as well as global leaderboards, and we have a winner here.
B009GEAPYW|5.0|bought for my Grandson for a sleepover. Kept 4 10y/o boys quite. Wonderful. to bad the movie wasn't a couple more hours long. lol

B008O9V4C2|5.0|A Donald Fagen album, with all his good taste, elegance e interesting lyrics. What else must one say? A superb album.
0865478767|4.0|Being provoked to think should not be on your list of pet peeves before reading this book.<br />The author relays questions encountered during his life to his readers on a recurring basis, both focusing you on some of the struggles of the industry but also in an attempt to think for yourself and evaluate the situations posed independently.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The reader need not over-use his/ her imagination reading 50 Shades. Look, roll the eyes, bite the lower, sex detail, more detail and climax, repeat if necessary is the basic structure of the story. Certain sex tools used will confuse some readers, question need and  purpose are left to engage the imagination.
B003KK65KG|3.0|Not my favourite. But an nice easy read with the usual Picoult suspense and twisting turns. Similar to a couple of her others.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|The Power of Habit, has truly made a believer out of me that 'habit' is such a key element to making great changes, if we know the how.  Is applied to every aspect of our lives, is was hard to put down and also to find out how it has impact the lives of people, products, etc., we recognize on our daily lives.  Charles Duhigg has done a great job making it so easy to read and understand!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It is as interesting as the other books. It is the best one so far. I can't wait to read the next one.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|To frustrating to play on my tiny droid phone, although fun! First app I downloaded to my fire when I got it. But all this app does is; crash crash crash crash.  Oh wait, then crashes some more!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I would like it if energy was easier to come by. Hate having to wait. I'm not that patient. And with no energy I can't even get the money I've earned. Starts to get very frustrating.
1573225517|4.0|This book is mostly about a boy named Rob. Rob is a thirty something British pop music junkie that is dealing with a breakup with his live in girlfriend names Lauran. Rob owns a shop where he sells records and Vinyl with the help of his musical moron twins Dick and Barry. They spend most of their days coming up with a top five list and share it with one another. Robs life is pretty much not going any ware so he starts to go back to his previous break ups with his girlfriends to see what he's done wrong. My opinion on this book would be not so good, the reason for this is because I'm not really a guy that's into music and drama so if that's you this book will suit you best. Also I don't like books that are dates back to the 90s and older. But one thing I liked was that it was about a group of guys that work in a shop trying to reach a goal.<br />The reason I didn't like that book so much would be because it has too much drama. I'm not a guy that's really into drama so this book was too much for me to handle.  For example so many breakups happened it this book I couldn't even count.  Also I didn't like that there was a lot of switching back and forth form girlfriends and boyfriends, for example rob and his girlfriend Lauran were in relationships a few times throughout the book.  This is one of the reasons I did not like this book it had too much drama and breakups.<br />However one thing I liked about this book is that it was about a group of guys that work in a musical shop and they are trying to come up with new songs because music was a huge thing back in the 90s. they are trying to seek a company that reviews there five films that they created, reservoir dogs, Elvis Costello , cheers ,woody sang his stupid song to Kelly, and baby I love you.  That did not work out so he starts to think about his girl Lauran and comes up with an episode of thirty something. This is one reason why I really liked this book, because it was active and a lot was going on in this book.<br />On a scale of 1-10 I would rate this book a 7.5.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great story thought it was over then noticed I still had half a book to read and read I did! The story took a turn and I felt like I was reading a second book that finished the first! Amazing book one of the best I have ever read. Don't pass on this book!
B0059XTU1S|2.0|Where do I start? I laughed how stupid some of the Dwarfs looked, absolutely ridiculous, not all of them, but most. The goblins looked very similar to the Orks accept they were smaller, but the Goblin king, he was big as a Troll, I don't understand why they made him so much more bigger than the rest of his own kind, a Goblin (in my opinion) should look green and reptilian. Peter Jackson could have separated the difference between Orks and Goblins better. The Trolls looked good, they looked like what a Troll should. With that aside, here's huge problem with this film, there is 13 Dwarfs 1 Hobbit and a Wizard, they fight which seems to be hundreds of Goblins, and not one gets killed or seriously injured, then the bridge their on collapses and falls into a underground canyon, the fall is some where around seven seconds, maybe ten, this would be between 1000 and 1600 foot drop, no one could have survived this and then the Goblin King falls on top them after they hit bottom and he's bigger than all them combined, he's probably weighs over a ton. Then they climb out from under the rabble of the bridge, which the Goblin king lies dead on top, dust themselves off and run for it. No injures, no one dead (I 'm boggled as to why the goblin King fell right on top of them, he fell from a bridge like 10 minutes before they fell) this is completely idiotic, I know this kind of movie is made for children, then maybe it's not, I know this is a swords and sorcery film, a fantasy movie with dragons and wizards, but there has to be a hint of believability, no would survive a 1400 foot fall, not even King Kong. A group of 15 is out numbered by at least 30 goblins to 1 and they virtually walk away unscathed. This is what I mean by believability. The ork leader and his brood were basically the main antagonists, the leader looked stupid and there was little known about him, I don't think production gave him much thought, maybe they did, if they did, they screwed his character up, I didn'treally feel any thing for this villain, (like...dislike) nothing. Actually I thought he's was pathetic, by meaning, you let a midget chop off your arm, you're at least 7 time bigger than he is, what you should do is step on him and squash him like a bug. The way the ork leader looked reminds me of the the villain in the second Hulk movie, the Abomination, it looked as if the producers couldn't settle on how he should have looked, and they botched him, same here. (I'm not saying the ork leader looked like the Abomination, just saying how they handled him) This movie was long and it felt long, just like Cloud Atlas. The acting was over all OK, accept for Ian McKellen, he looked as if he was there just for the paycheck. He probably thought to himself \\" God this movie's silly beyond belief\\". Personally I like sword and sorcery/super hero/science fiction flicks, I just don't like bad movies, this movie not a rotten egg, but it's close.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This series had beautiful scenery in and outside of the house.  It contained all sorts of life events in the plot and the actors all were outstanding in their performances.  I could hardly stop watching.  I was touched by the way the family(the aristocrats) treated their servants as important to their lives and treated them with respect.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|estoy muy contento de haber elegido comprar estos dvd por un precio bien bajo pero de excente calidad.<br />muy conforme y voy a volver a comprar estas peliculas a bajo precio ....gracias.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|This app connects thee Kindle Fire to the resources of the Weather Channel and provides a comprehensive picture of how the weather will affect your area as well as other areas (worldwide) that you are interested in. The data is, for the most part, reliable (as reliable as weather data can be) but the advavtage this app provides is that you can access the information on your schedule without relying on the weather information provided by radio or television forecasts. The ability to access weather information about different locations means that you can plan more accurately when you travel whether for business or pleasure.<br /><br />The app occasionally locks up resulting in the need to restart my Kindle but the price (free) more than covers this inconvenience.<br /><br />The recent update is so BAD that I have removed the app from my Kindlloo and will look elsewhere for more reliable software.
B003B02O14|5.0|A really good read.  I think one of Grisham's best.  Exciting all the way to the end.  I highly recommend it to anyone whether you are a fan of John Grisham's works or not.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Started off really well but it seems like it just ended in an odd place and in an odd way.  The romantic relationship between the lead character was a little too odd for me as well.
0553378384|5.0|I am in the learning mode about North Nodes so was delighted someone told me about this book.  Packed with information.
1439127700|4.0|The Presidents Club describes the relationships between ex-presidents and current presidents, from the time of Truman up through the Obama administration (it was published in 2011.) The authors, both editors at Time, dig into archives and biographies for letters, interviews, oped pieces, and anecdotes that shed light on these men and how they got along (or didn't, in some cases.)<br />I wound up with a lot more respect for most (but not all). These are/were unique men with great abilities--and sometimes, great flaws. Their anecdotal stories are told in chronological order, which is sometimes confusing.<br />Depending how old you are and what you remember, you may want to dive right into the president you remember best, and get some insight into what was going on behind the scenes. But be forewarned--these stories are not biographies and are not thorough. The book maintains its focus on ex-presidents and the interplay of their personalities--not on wives or world events or anything else, except in the most superficial way.<br />In the conclusion, the authors write,\\" If the Presidents Club had a seal, around the ring would be three words: cooperation, competition, and consolation.\\"<br />Those three Cs pretty much sum it up--but I'll add that competition sometimes erupted into feuds that lasted for years, or muttered accusations of meddling and treason. Which makes it all the more interesting.
B00338QENI|4.0|Very good reading.  It's amazing how life changes family.  I do recommend this book to others, have patience as it is a little drawn out.

B004J4WNL2|2.0|I was disappointed in this book. The simple idea of her premise could have been easily stated in an article rather than in an overly-long book padded with too many research studies.

B00008NRL8|5.0|I in love with this CD, it fits every occasion, the music is interesting, suave, and powerful in the same time.
B005IQZB14|3.0|The age of character were to young for me to relate to. It was an interesting story because I learned a lot about this area of the country that I actually live in.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|there is variety and challenge in these games! really have a lot of fun with these games.  glad I chose this game.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Had me up all night reading. Hit very close to home and stirred up some emotions, but also had good insight with how things can be managed and move forward.  Can't believe that this is not a true story!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Paid full price for this book and I was not disappointed.  I enjoyed every page read and I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good story.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is a wonderful book.<br />I read it in 2 days. I want to go watch the movie and see if it's like the book.
B008TRUDAS|3.0|The book is ok however it is a book more for teens.  If I were 16 I would have given it a 5 star.
0345529057|5.0|I can't stop reading these books.<br />Since I got them , most of my free time is dedicated to reading :)
B000JQUZCI|5.0|Great timeless classic. I love how it was free when I got it. :) Haven't read the whole book yet though. I only got it because it was free.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|Could not play the game. Too many ads and popups. I did not enjoy it at all. I know it is free and all, but still need to tone down all the pop ups.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|It is hard to write an honest review without any spoilers. I read \\"Hopeless\\" last week and fell in love with the author, so I decided to look into her other two books. I got home at 2 today, and since it was a dreary day I decided to begin \\"Slammed\\". Amazing decision! I couldn't put it down. I read the whole thing in a matter of a couple of hours. I have mascara streaks down my face to prove it! I highly recommend this book to anyone with a \\"sensitive\\" side. ;)
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Wow, what a great series. Book three really pulled it all together. I would describe this as a wonderful love story with some really great fun. Highly recommend you read all three books.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|TWO GRAVES IS AN EXCELLENT BOOK. TIES TOGETHER A LOT OF THE STORY LINES FROM THE PENDERGAST SERIES AND LEAVES IT OPEN FOR POSSIBLY MORE TO COME.
0765325950|5.0|What an epically appropriate and wonderfully satisfying conclusion; wasn't sure it could be done right with justice to all of the characters who I've grown to love over the years but it was, and beautifully. Disregard all of the one star reviews about the e-book and just buy the hard copy version now!
B000MV9026|5.0|From our youngest 3 year old to our grandmother, this makes a wonderful family movie to watch together and everyone enjoys it.
B00AS1Q93S|4.0|The BIGGEST problem with the movie is the length. At least, it seemed too long. The screenplay/direction wasn't tight enough. As a result, the average score of 3 1/2 stars to 4 stars is appropriate. I can't say I didn't like the movie, but it is just a little better than OK.<br />I don't understand the personal attacks against TOM CRUISE. Despite the differences in the physical differences with the character in the books, (I haven't read any of them) I thought TOM CRUISE was more than sufficient portraying the character on screen. The screenplay/direction are the problems with this movie, not Tom Cruise. I liked it well enough, but I wouldn't watch it again.
B007M45PMU|5.0|These guys are great!.  I love the quirky, funny and generally upbeat lyrics and melodies. Can't wait for the next one.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Great read for an 800 page book! Kept my attention the whole way through. I recommend a nice cup of tea to go with it.
B003LXSY60|3.0|Wish I had just purchased the few songs I like but it was really cheap for the album. Oh Well
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I couildn' believe I finished he book.  I won't be buying ANY of he other books in the trilogy.  I have no complaints about the story line, it was alright, but I find it hard to believe that so many other readers want to read such explicit sexual actions.  I mean, it's porn.  Thank God there are others that feel the same as I do. Sadly, there are probably more that want to read it.
B000LC55F2|5.0|Thanks for a great product. We couldn't find the movie anywhere else and this one was as good as if we took if from a shelf at a store. Thanks so much.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Surprisingly, I really did like this trilogy.  I will probably read them all again.  I didn't rate it at five because I can't say that I loved it, but I did really enjoy and like the trilogy.  I read these before I saw the movies and enjoyed reading them much more than seeing them.
B0002V7OI8|5.0|Thanks for a great product. We couldn't find the movie anywhere else and this one was as good as if we took if from a shelf at a store. Thanks so much.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Much better than I had anticipated, especially after seeing the movie first. I couldn't put it down, having finished the book within five days.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Love this series. The story and suspense are addictive. I don't think all the gore is necessary and the CGI effects are a bit annoying and fake-looking, but overall a fun show to watch.
0765325950|5.0|I have been reading this series over and over for 20 years. I have waited patiently (okay, not always patiently) for this book to be released. Sanderson did a great job writing for Jordan. I won't spoil it, but it is packed with non-stop action and heartbreaking situations that make you root for the underdogs. I had mixed emotions about the ending, only because I have lived with these characters for 20 years, so it is hard to let go. The ending was perfect, but still makes me wish for more. If only Jordan could carry onto Elayne's babies. Avienda's children, what happens to the Seanchan and the black tower! I will always love this series, and am saddened to see it end. But, I will reread it over and over like I have been from the beginning. Great job Sanderson and thank you for taking on such a huge project and seeing it through to the end!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love your app, but the mpoints sign in doesn't work for the version of the Jellybean OS that I'm on.  Mpoints claims that they have sent the data to fix this, and everyone is waiting on you to update.  So please update!
030758836X|5.0|I do not want to be a spoiler to this page turning tome.  You will enjoy this novel so very much. Nick and Amy meet in New York City and fall madly in love.  They are very happy until Nick gets laid off. Then he finds out his mother has cancer and his father has Alzheimer's.  They move to Missouri and begin a life there.  One day a neighbor calls Nick at the bar he owns to come home His front door is wide open. He finds signs of a big struggle and his wife, Amy is missing. Nick calls the police but starts lying. He is a man with lots of secrets. You will not be able to put this one down until it is finished!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|A friend recommended Lee Child so decided to go with the first one with character Jack Reacher.  Really liked the suspense, well written and I could actually visualize the characters.  Enjoyed the suspense, enjoyed the flow, enjoyed the fact that there were not so many characters that one could get confused.  Looking forward to reading the other books.
B0079R8IYW|3.0|Does not always stand well. Protection of the screen is very good. Needs to be more stable. Would probably buy again.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I simply adored this trilogy and really was hooked on it, could not put the book down and once I finished the third book, I was actually in withdrawal! So, I read all three again.  I found the story compelling and so very erotic;  left me wanting more and more!  I enjoyed the storyline, was fascinated by how patient Ana was and so very enthralled with it all!  Can't remember ever feeling this way about a story and fear that it will not happen again for a long time.  You either love this series or you don't, it's that simple.  Lucky for me, I truly fell in love with it!
B0053O89WY|5.0|I don't care if &#34;real&#34; geeks make fun of me for watching BBT, it's funny and entertaining and I look forward to watching it and getting some of the references. We'd previously watched most of the seasons on Netflix (having missed out on it when it first aired) and then just before season 6 started were wanting to get caught up on season 5. I personally bought the digital editions and then bought the DVDs as a Christmas gift for relatives.<br /><br />So if you were at the end of the fourth season, waiting to find out what happened after Penny spent the night with Raj, you will be amply entertained.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I really love this series and can't wait for the 3rd to come out.. I think it is written way better than 50 Shades..it is not cut and paste sex scenes but changes up constantly. I think it has a better story line also. Must read!!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Enjoyed the twisting plot. The way Grisham unravels the story is masterful. Quick read. Kept my attention throughout the whole story.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is very addictive. I highly recommend this to anyone. Fun for all ages. If you're bored this will provide lots of entertainment. You can do so much!
B005H0IW6W|5.0|I like anything by Michael Buble.  I would recommend it to all my friends. He sings in the old fashioned way that I like.
B000SW4DXK|5.0|I love this movie. It has a wonderful, heartwarming story and beautiful colors and scenes, especially on the blu ray. It is a tradition in our family to watch this. I love the \\"I believe\\" campaign during the trial. It's fun to see everyone coming together like that. I definitely recommend this movie
B008ELUEQC|5.0|I like anything by Rod Stewart.  I already recommended it to some of my friends. We played it throughout the holiday season.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|What can I say? Diner Dash games on any device is great! I love it on the Kindle Fire. I would recommend this game to anyone for any age.
B0042AEOG0|3.0|I wanted the recording of &#34;All I Want for Christmas is You&#34;  I really like it, but the other songs on the album are just ok.
1423113462|5.0|The Lost Hero deepens and broadens the story line from the Percy Jackson series. The action is even faster paced than the Jackson books. Simply put, it is fun to read. The humor and the wry comments are crisp and meaningful; they help to clarify the points the story is making and also to link the ancient and modern world through human experiences which recur again and again. The differences between the Greek and Roman gods are seldom noted, but they were very real, and they reflected the differences between two cultures. Looking at the differences and similarities between them and relating these to our own day, the book gives the reader insights into human thought and society while simply telling a good story. This book and its fellows are well worth the reading time. A good companion to them is Rose Williams' Gods and Other Odd Creatures\\" which places Greek and Roman gods side by side, tells about them, and discusses the earliest beginnings as told by the ancients.
B00A8KJK7G|5.0|The movie I chose to review is titled Frankenweenie. This movie is rated PG. Time Burton directed this movie and released it in 2012. This movie is about a boy named Victor whose dog, Sparky passes away. In school, Victor had been learning about how electricity can make deceased animals \\"come back to life\\" with a few volts. So Victor decides to test this theory on his dog during a horrendous thunderstorm. Then, Sparky miraculously comes back to life. People start hearing about this and want in. I personally love Tim Burton movies and this one was no disappointment.  I love how weird and original it was. I also enjoyed  how the movie has \\"Gross\\" parts without it being too vulgar. I didn't like how it provided a lot of useless information in the beginning. I also didn't like how people were scared of Sparky after he was revived. The audience best suited for this movie is almost anyone. This movie is perfect for anyone who enjoys those weird sci-fi movies. I highly recommend this movie.
B00A4YVHXQ|1.0|Really worthless app.  It was not worth the download.  I cannot say how unimpressed I am with this jerky umimpressive product.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This trilogy is worth reading. I would recommend this to my friends. The author really describes the characters well. I will continue onto book three.
B007WEQ3K8|5.0|It's like exercise for the brain. I try to use it daily when I have a few minutes. Works great and is fun to play.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|its fast paced and enchanting.  I love most of the characters.  I am a fairy tale fan from way back when.  Once upon a time adds a new twist to the fairy  tale characters
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Good read, well paced. If you like Robert Parker's Spencer books you'll like Reacher also. I had to add five more words.
B00A7CF1QY|5.0|goood-movie! Love the sires and the action !  im a hi-tech fan , the suspence was refreshing !  Gooood-Movie !
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This is well made and does the job. You're not going to get any better than this. Buy it. Buy with confidence. This sell is wicked sharp. ;) Have awesome day.
0061733199|5.0|This is a great book but don't ever just use one source knowledge is the best survival tool . Also check out his urban survival guide and don't forget to try out the techniques for making a fire navigation and all the other is useful tools for survival.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Great App!!!! Nice to be able to use Ebay on my tablet!!!!! Very easy to use and a truly handy App!!!!!!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Connelly knows how to bring you into a story.  The way he talks about the past and bringing it to the present.  The twist that are involved in this book are great.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|True, nothing much happens, but it is still a great read, and if you're a fan you have to read it, after all it is a story being told and it is the author who tells it, not us fans.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|What's there to say..really the AVENGERS. Great Movie. nice to be able to watch it on all my devices at anytime anywhere!
B007FEFLTO|2.0|B-o-r-i-n-g. The best word in my dictionary to describe this book. I still don't believe such an author wrote this book. Silly many times, it is definitely not worth your time. If you want to learn about the history, grab a good history book instead.
B007SGM084|1.0|A knockoff mix of Twilight and a lil movie called The Secretary.<br />So disappointed.  I will stick with reading good murder mysteries.
0061091480|5.0|I read this book when I was 22 now I am 60. I purchased it for my daughter, who was having personal crisis.  I hoped it would help her find herself as it had for me.  She didn't read it, and she still hasn't found herself.
1476719071|5.0|Jamie McGuire is such a talented author. Her characters come to life and her writing makes you feel like you're apart of their world. This book is addictive and won't want to put it down.
B00846REIS|5.0|Such an easy read. Writing in this book is much better than 50 Shades of Grey, however both books are good.
158270208X|5.0|THIS BOOK IS A GREAT BOOK TO USE TO JOURNAL ON A DAILY BASES.  I HAVE BEEN USING IT SINCE 2009 AND HAVE NINE JOURNALS.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I laughed and cried within seconds of each other. This book is beautiful and captures human emotion so well. Loved it!
B006R8GK2Q|3.0|It was fun playing the game, and it was a great distraction while staying with a family member in the hospital.  I was sad when it was done.
B004BSIJ9Q|5.0|I'm a Huge fan of Kanye West. This album will make you one too. I cant wait for his next album. it will be pretty hard to top this one.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I like the Crossfire Series and will still continue to read them, but I find the story in the 50 Shades Series a little better. There are some exact similarities in the Crossfire Series to the 50 Shades that annoyed me too. All in all though these are a great pacifier until the 50 Shades Movie comes out.
B005VPRDAY|2.0|When I ordered this for my daughter for Christmas, I was excited to find Legos at what I thought was a great price, compared to what they charge in stores for Legos. But, upon opening we discovered that you don't get much for your buck. It is very difficult to call these Legos, when it is just the tiniest pieces imaginable. You get more single dots of Legos than you do the larger building pieces, and they are incredibly tiny and easy to lose. They are very difficult to build with. I would say spend the extra $15 or so and buy a real tub of Legos.
B00846REIS|4.0|I like the Crossfire Series and will still continue to read them, but I find the story in the 50 Shades Series a little better. There are some exact similarities in the Crossfire Series to the 50 Shades that annoyed me too. All in all though these are a great pacifier until the 50 Shades Movie comes out.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|this app is great because it keeps you reminded to plug your devices in for a much longer time span of play
B0002EXH54|5.0|Great album, a must have for Megadeth fans. Features the original line up, has some of their classic songs. Good raw edge combined with good musician ship and Dave' attitude.
0345803485|2.0|I appreciated the first five erotic scenes but, frankly, it gets redundant and the subpar writing was not enough to keep me entertained when they weren't doing it.
B0074VTHKM|2.0|this wasn't one of Grisham's best. Its a simple read, and really dragged on for me. I wouldn't suggest it to anyone. I love most of his books, but not this one.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Enjoyed this crazy plot even though it was very sad at times. Sky's friend Six should have reappeared toward the end.  Holder was little too good to be true.
0385535147|2.0|I'm a John Grisham fan and love most of his books. Unfortunately, this was a boring read. I kept waiting for the suspense but alas...NOTHING.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Hopefully you have read the first book in the trilogy so that the growth of the characters is fascinating .  The generations, history,and human interest keeps you wanting more.  I am waiting to read the third installment which is not out yet.  That is the cons on this book.
B009ANP48G|5.0|SHE IS 15 AND WHEN SHE RECEIVED IT, SHE WAS JUMPING WITH JOY AND COULDN'T WAIT TO VIEW IT IN 3D.  SHE LOVED IT.  WE WOULD RECOMMEND TO THE YOUNGER GENERATION ESPECIALLY ANYONE INTERESTED IN MODERN DANCE.
B000001FOS|5.0|Best Malmsteen's album. All the songs are beautiful. The disc's sound great. One of the best CDs in my collection. I love the music that he wrote in the 80s.
0440245206|5.0|I LOVE EVERYTHING DANIELLE STEEL WRITES.  IT WAS VERY GOOD!  I WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE. I LOOK FORWARD TO EVERY NEW RELEASE FROM THIS AUTHOR.
B00005K9LM|5.0|When I at the first time listened this album, I was shocked. The power and beauty of the music was on top. My favorite Judas Priest's  album.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|A joy to play and hugely addictive for many hours Persona 4 represents the pinnacle of RPG experiences. To have it playable on a handheld makes it a must buy and is easily the best game on the Vita. 5/5
B000002H1T|5.0|Every song on this album is simply a masterpiece. Highly recommended. The best music of the 80's. Very good sound. I love Heartbeat City .
B009O2XY12|5.0|My 19 month old loves watching and yelling \\"pop pop pop\\" to this game. I enjoy the 'goals' you have to accomplish for extra coins/jems.
B001EOOQEM|5.0|When Dio left the Rainbow to join the Black Sabbath is a new level. Charisma and the magnificent voice of God enrich black music. For me is the best Black Sabbath's  album. Good sound on the disc only add emotions.
B005IQ39AY|4.0|Is a guess the game is pretty good except for the end. After I FAILED A LEVEL it just sits there. I exited several times to reset and it was still sitting at the same place. Eventually it went back to the home page. Then you have to start over. Another thing I noticed was that you can not change the color of the ball being used or the next ball either. I have played other games where I could plan my next move and use the best choice to score with whatever color ball I chose. It does look very nice on my new kindle fire HE.
B000001FLA|5.0|The first best album. After many years, has not lost its relevance. It is difficult to say which song is worse or better than another.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|I was first introduced to Glen Hansard and Markéta Irglová by my husband in their Swell Season CD. I just love their music and when I learned of this movie they did together, I had to get it.  Highly recommend!  Great story!
B009EANE3M|5.0|I've listened to this album on Spotify probably 20-30 times, but I felt I should buy it to support the artists. This album is absolutely fantastic; eminently listenable. The only soft spot on the album is, in my opinion, Give the Love Around; it's just not my style.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Great movie!  I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he was very pleased.  Great addition to our DVDs.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|my son downloaded this game, one day i tried it and found that hey its not such a bad game after all. i love the colors of it, i have not been able to get to the next level but i do try everyday,lol. its like sonic, the boy is running throught he tracks as he is running he is collecting coins, a cop is running behind him, you can make the boy jump, roll duck and go really fast.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|I purchased coins twice and have not received the product! what's wrong with this[[ASIN:B008Y2FRFO Coin Dozer]], why can't the coins be accessible right after purchase.
B00633W614|4.0|Rypical of this autor, you can't stop reading... Sometimos a little excessive in it's twists in the story line, by totally forgivable.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|Fits perfect, works perfect. The stand part holds it just where you want it. It is better than I expected.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|so much fun for the whole family! plus anything star wars is awesome!my kids especially love it. our five years old plays it all the time.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't put it down. Excellent read and surprises along the way. Each chapter was intriguing and exciting. One of the best books I've read in a long time.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I asked myself how come amazing real stories of courage, strength, faith, love, encouragement and devotion are not promoted on TV newscasts and other media.<br />I experienced so many feelinigs while reading this book, but the most important thing was the inspiration and strength I felt while reading this real life story. Not only because of what Adam Brown went through but his whole family. To me this book is a must read.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app, it is very easy repinning, doing everything that the website does. I have had no problems on my Kindle Fire. I agree with others, this app works much better than other Pinterest apps.
B008MEM24S|4.0|I got this game for my son and he plays it all the time so I guess he likes it.  I haven't played it yet.
B007THA4FI|4.0|A little too jumpy at times but always interesting. Completely not what I expected from this author but good to see a different perspective in her writing.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I don't like the fact that after playing a few games I can only play it while on line now.  I really don't like games I have to play while on line.  I like the convenience of playing anywhere, anytime.
0743297334|5.0|Having read it (and written about it ) in college plus the &#34;Paris Wife&#34; this summer,  together with the recent HBO special about Ernest and Martha, I thought it best to re-read it and see if my impressions of his work had changed with the years that had passes.  They didn't.  Still a great read.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This app works great as long as you're logged on to a WiFi network. Obviously, it's not going to work if you're not logged in. I loved seeing the photos in easily viewable size without needing to click for a larger version.
B000002JSP|5.0|This album delivers the best of some &#34;LED FOR YOUR HEAD!!&#34; Brings back  memories of the good ole days!!<br />Creating new memories jammin' to LED in 2013!
B0082RHRHC|3.0|Jane Eyre is a 19th-century classic, and certainly worth the reading. On the other hand, if  you worry about spending the time to read a Victorian &#34;three-decker&#34;, better spend  it  reading &#34;David Copperfield&#34; or &#34;Nicholas Nickleby.&#34;
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Was better than the 2nd one.... much more entertaining, good storyline easy to follow. Good casting as well. Could have had a few more types of aliens and mores scenes with the worms.
0446580848|3.0|I love DeMille and in particular love John Corey, but this one was hard work!  Three quarters of the book was smart quips which start to wear after a while, for a good ending.  Come on Nelson you can do better!
B00AA7O22U|4.0|This film is about who has the biggest ego the whole movie is a. lesson in sarcasm ! An the double  talk that is in all action movies as the principles trade tag lines  and save the world .
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I am ashamed to admit this, but I succumbed to peer pressure (at my age) and bought this book. I was assured that it was raunchy, but well-written. Half of that is right: this is simply Harlequin porn. So badly written, even the &#34;facts&#34; contradict themselves. Waste of time- but luckily not too much- because it's a poorly written, easy read.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|though this would be fun but is boring gets old fast with , no challenge  can't see the what the whole buzz is about
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Coins too slow. Need instructions on puzzle pieces. takes to long to get puzzle pieces overall good game to get wrapped up in.
B00280LYIM|5.0|I have loved this whole series so far I am so excited to read the last one and move to the next
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|The game and rewards just keep getting better the longer you play it.  Very entertaining, if you have time to indulge, because you won't want to stop playing..
1455523550|5.0|With the movie coming out next month, I couldn't refuse buying this book. Extremely happy with this read. Would highly recommend to any and all women!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its pretty fun! I love the exciting COMPETITIONS! it really is realistic! I don't like how much things cost though.
0307895475|5.0|I'm not wild about how the quests are laid out in the guide, but hey, the info is in there at least!  Over 800+ page and honestly, there could be more info included.  It's amazing, the scope of this wonderful game.  One wish though:  make this available for Kindle!  It would make it so much easier to use!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is actually fairly challenging, and a lot of fun. However, the $.99 price makes no sense, the app is free on android's \\"Play Store\\".
B009UNGYHG|4.0|Charges the voyager legend with no problem. Also uses the same usb connector (micro usb) as most newer phones so you don't need the proprietary one that comes with the headset. It does come with the cable and charger as well. There is one flaw--Unlike their 975 charge case which has a lighted meter showing charging status and charge status-this model has 2 light which can be confusing if you don't remember what the 2 blue lights mean. It is in the manual but so easy to forget.<br />All in all a worthwhile accessory allowing for easy storage in a pocket and also easy charging. Does extend the use time between wall or usb charging.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This book is heartbreaking, and amazing, and original, and it has a soundtrack, and poetry, and uugghh it was so so so good to read.<br /><br />I loved the slam aspect of the book more than anything else, I think. And for those of you who don't know what a slam is, is a form of poetry focused on performance. It's just... The scenario Colleen Hoover created on the book for such was the most amazing thing. I got goosebumps every time I read one of the poems. It was such a strong form of literature I... I have no words for how much I loved it and how it made me feel.<br /><br />If I'm being honest the story kind of took a secondary place for me, because of that. But that doesn't mean the plot wasn't good. It actually was one of the most original plots I've read for a while now. It was refreshing and different from what's being written these days in Contemporary Romance.<br /><br />So if you're looking for having your heart broken in a million pieces and then put back together in the most fantastic way, this is definitely the book for you!
B0084I9QIW|5.0|I love this concert. Okay, I love anything Michael Jackson, lol. But this one has a lot of my favorites on it.
B003K16P3M|4.0|It took me a long time to get into this book. I considered giving it up more than one time at the beginning, but now I'm glad I decided to stick with it until the end. The plot gets a whole lot better as you get closer to the middle of the story, and from then on it's actually a pretty exciting read.<br /><br />The book tells us the story of Katsa, a girl Graced with the ability to kill people with her bare hands, and arrows, and daggers, and swords, and really in any way that it's possible to kill someone. She's accustomed to being used as the king's executioner, that is until she meets Prince Po and her life changes in the most drastic ways.<br /><br />What I liked most about the whole book is how badass Katsa is. She doesn't need anyone to come to her defense and rescue her from danger or herself. She's a fighter, and she is deadly, but she's still kind, even if nobody else believes it. I also loved how Po accepts her for who she is, never asking her for more than she can give him, and more so that she stays true to herself and what she wants from life, not changing just because she suddenly likes a boy.<br /><br />After you get into the story, it flows easily, and it's exciting, and fun, and I'm glad I didn't give up on it.
1465001107|5.0|It arrived quickly and I love it. I get compliments on it all the time. My best friend ordered one as well.
B009VB97EY|1.0|Lousy movie, no plot. Glad I didn't buy this movie. Would rather watch Chippendales! Acting was horrible-ending predictable. Don't waste your time or money.
B00APUQJLO|1.0|I would give this zero stars if I could. Boring, senseless, and a waste of time. I am shocked than anyone would rate this 5 stars.
B0054JELS4|3.0|This package seems more expensive than I'd like and I'm having some issues with some of the cd's not playing some episodes without pauses, but that may be my dvd player..
B0060AY85C|5.0|In this brief novel not so brief themes are addressed: the war, the economy, race, family, identity.  We can hardly expect less from Toni Morrison.  But here, her mastery of the vernacular becomes an extraordinary, poetic vehicle.  The voyage of Frank, the novel's main character, becomes the reader's own inner voyage.  Morrison's prose glides by easily, like all things profoundly familiar, even as the emotions grow in intensity as the novel progresses.<br /><br /> When truth intervenes, it arrives with a capital `T' and a capital sentence.  Unless Frank does something about it.  Face this truth: face his humanity, now undone, and reconstruct it.  War, of course, has destroyed that humanity.  Ironically, it is loss and death (and that frail sister) that are Frank's only chances of redemption.  Home is that place where one's humanity is found --redefined, and no smooth ride will ever take us there.<br /><br /> Still, Toni Morrison's readers travel along.  Along sadness, frailness, beauty.  Simplicity, which is the way of the skillful.  Add power and depth to that simplicity, and you know why this is a work of literature by one of its most brilliant representatives.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because I don't think your energy should run out.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I couldn't wait to get to this book every day. It was intriguing. It is impossible to describe the plot and make the story sound as compelling as it is. The two main characters were players in a &#34;game&#34; that was never clearly defined to them or to the reader. The desire to learn the rules and how to define a winner kept me reading.
B007704HO6|5.0|This is a real heartwarming story of devotion and redemption. When Bob came into James' life, it forever changed both of them. It truly captures the amazing bond between animal and man.
0307352145|5.0|now I know what it is... society!<br /><br />Not three weeks before I read this book I was commenting to someone that \\"growing up\\" for me has been a long journey of learning how to put on this extrovert mask for everyone.  To pretend to be outgoing and sociable.  It's been said that one cannot know ones own culture.  I had taken it for granted that extroversion was \\"normal\\" and that I wasn't.<br /><br />This book does a fantastic job explaining our collective adoration for extroverts and what the author calls the Extrovert Ideal.  She also enumerates the upsides to being introverted or \\"highly sensitive\\", a related trait.<br /><br />This book has helped me understand not only myself, but other people I know as well.  A great read!
B0054LJGWS|5.0|I'm too lazy to write a large review, not really my thing. But I would highly recommend this book to anyone who loves to laugh. It is hilarious, and the story is intriguing as well.<br /><br />I haven't found a better book yet.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I love this game I dont think its too scary anymore. Last night I droped my kindle fire. You get to find 8 pages and walk. It awsome!
B009G41CG2|3.0|The game is fun, but I am just having trouble getting used to playing it on a smaller scale. But I WILL NOT GIVE UP.
B001AIRUP4|3.0|The movie itself was good but the code for the digital download (the reason I bought it in the first place) had expired already. I didn't think it would have an expiration date...what's the point of that?
B00632HWOG|5.0|I am happy  that I can read then move on as slow or as fast as I want. I just like it.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Agent P is amazing. I am a huge fan of the show and puzzle games.... this is a great combination of both.
B007SY3CEW|4.0|I HAVE always loved music.As.a youngster I took piano lessons, but never stuck with it. I have always regretted it. This gives me a chance to learn on my own.
B005M68S4W|5.0|Duets 11 - Watched the public TV program and had to order the album for my Kindle.  Very easy listening.

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Amazingly and beautifully written! Rick Riordan did it again. He flawlessly creates a master piece out of each book. Wonderful!
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|Really like the game. I am a quilter. Keeps my interest.<br />Works well. Even has the snap feel for proper placement.
034580404X|5.0|ive never read a book(s) like this before. so i wanted to see what all the hype was about. for me it met my expectations and more. a glimpse into the dom/sub world was intriguing to me.
B007P3S1AQ|2.0|I didnt hate this movie.  I just thought it was going to be very different.  Terribly sad.  The acting is excellent, but I just felt like its not a movie for me.  Maybe its too deep or whatever, but its not for me.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I did not know what all the fuse was about, until I started reading them.  I could not put them down.
B004GBIE3Y|4.0|I really liked this movie.  The previews made it seem a bit sad.  It was nice to see Zach be a different character, and everyone else was also excellent.  The under pressure scene is awesome.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|What can I say, I loved all of the books.  I really did not think I would enjoy them, until I started reading, I could not put them down.
B008EQIK90|5.0|This movie is awesome.  Both leads do a great job.  I love comedies and some movies try to hard.  This one was excellent.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Good reading, as always.  But then, I enjoy all the books he writes.  Highly recommended.  I could not put it down.
B007BZM3HK|4.0|I like all music and this was a freebie one day with a coupon.  Radio pop is great sometimes.  But it can get stuck in your head.
B001NLKT60|5.0|I didn't read any of these books till I saw the american version of The Girl w/ The Dragon Tattoo. I had no idea what to expect but loved it! I read the book in days and dove into this one. So far its great!
B00A23MYCC|5.0|I didnt think I would like this movie as much as I did.  Full disclosure, I love movies that are really funny, but could be classified as bad movies.  Grand Mas boy, Baseketball, and so forth.  This is a classic.
B008QCBFHG|5.0|I wish I can see it in person, I wish I was born back in that time, now days the music they play at the opera house sucks.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|The show ends tonight.  Which is sad.  5 seasons and it has gone from a xfiles like show, to a much more cohesive character driven scifi show.  It does REQUIRE you to pay attention.  It is not a show for idiots.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love how all my notes are backed up in cyberspace, so when my devices fail, I can still have my notes retrievable on another device. HUGE sigh of relief for me this morning!
B004HX0P2Y|5.0|I only saw it recently, and have seen it about 5 times since then.  I really like this movie.  A bit of action, but really character driven and its fantastic.
B008OOYALE|5.0|this game gets addicting from the very first time that you play it! It gets frustrating trying to complete some dragon combinations but that is what keeps u coming back for more!
0307236722|5.0|If you like pastry and you don´t know a lot of it, this is a very good book. Very easy recipes and the basics for somebody who starts cooking and want to be a professional. I recommend it!!
B0055QYKQO|5.0|This is a excellent MB.  No issues during install. No issues with recognizing all hardware.  I have had this board for a while now and no issues with it. I am very satisfied.  Gigabyte makes good boards, but avoid their video cards as they do not support them well.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|My first experience with Kurt Vonnegut. Loved it and couldn't put it down! Thought provoking and very readable. Read it!
B004D2A04M|3.0|While this holster holds the light itself very well, the swivel point is it's weakest link. While it's ok for LIGHT USE, it can't (and won't) last under any other conditions.<br />Snag it on some brush, and the holster will break off of the belt clip so easily, you will be shocked. When my son finished a job removing brush for one of our customers, he had nothing left on his belt but the clip. Mine broke as well about a week later, and I used epoxy to permanently repair it.<br /><br />In Short:<br />If you are using this gently, it's exactly what you want.<br />If you are a tradesman/woman, keep looking......
B000007ODL|5.0|My husband and I both like this CD. It is nice easy music that we both enjoy. Thank you very much.
B001NLKT60|5.0|the first book started slow but this one had me hooked right from the begining! Hoping the third book is as good.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|I liked this book, and I learned a lot of great stuff, but sometimes it's a pretty slow read and the research feels a little dubious
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|the game is fun but needs away to get peanuts without having to pay real money for them,  but all in all a great way to pass time
B008QDCZJ2|5.0|I don't see how anyone can call this mediocre and say that The Pet Shop Boys have lost it. With age comes experience and knowledge. Niels lyrics are always relevant and touching. Sometimes they reach so deep and touch in a way as to feel he's talking to or about you. At least your exact situation. Chris' music is just magical. Everytime I hear the bridge in the middle of Leaving my heart just stops and I'm blown away by it's subtle power.<br /><br />I really believe it's their most introspective and contemplative album since Behaviour and overall. I remind all the doubtful that Behaviour was considered weak upon it's release. Since then being realized as a seminal and poignant album. I hope in time Elysium will be given it's full appreciation. PSB still has it and is just plain diverse. They can still pound out the disco beats, but they're very melancholy at times, and ruminating. Hey I get it if you want the dance I love it too. Just remember and realize how smart and diverse these two world treasures Neil and Chris are. They rank with the best ever.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Really filmed nicely! Something different! A big surprise! I was hooked from the first episode. Can't wait for season 3.
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|Rent this on a friday night and laugh your head off!  It is definitely worth the $3 or $4 that you will pay on Amazon Instant Vid!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This book was really hard to put down and it kept you wondering about how the mystery would end.  I can't wait to read the rest of the Jack Reacher series.
B0084B5TK8|4.0|lots of suspense.  Please note that the cemetary by the sea, where  Dracula lands, has recently (1/2013) had a landslide!<br /><br />Nevertheless, I think that Bram Stoker had a very strange idea about the uses of Holy Communion.  I wish the characters had investigated the true use of the Sacred Species -- It is to be consumed by the Faithful!  Evil is best combatted within ourselves, don't you think?
B0041KVW2K|5.0|A Complete Beatles collection on vinyl all in one box on 180 gram disks! I must be dreaming. Oh and by the way lot's of pictures.<br />Do you know how much I have spent on Beatles records in the last twenty years? Me neither but I know it's more than what was paid for this box of records. Not to mention it's all of the studio recordings. If I had pulled any of these records out of the racks at a local record store today, five, ten, fifteen or twenty years ago it would have been the find of the year for me. Now it came in the mail from Music Direct in less than forty eight hours. I have had records from Mexico that took 48 months to show up on my door step.<br />After reading the comments about this record collection on Amazon that are negative saying the sound quality is not good. It got me thinking should I pay for this? Are all of these people tone deaf? Are there a lot of bad copy's floating around? Did they screw up yet another Beatles remaster?(it would not be the first time) Then I realized that I would just have to find out for myself and bought it from a reputable dealer.<br />Despite all of my worries about this gamble it turned out to be a winner. It sounds like a Beatles record no matter what disk I put on the plater.(cheap Pro-Ject turntable) Which brings me to ask. What are the other reviewers playing these on? Do they know how to set up a turntable? Do they not like the way George Martin produced recordings? Are they just complaining too complain?<br /><br /> After listening to this collection it sounds wonderful. Just remember you can't play it in your car.
B00005JKDQ|5.0|I looked everywhere trying to find this movie for my son for Christmas.  He gets a Hallmark ornament every year and it is designed with characters in children's movies.  His ornament this year was from the movie Monsters, Inc.  We always buy him the movie to match his ornament and he expects it too.  I was so happy to find it online and with shipping options just in time for Christmas.
B004EQAVHI|5.0|This is adaptation of Kazuo Ishiguro's novel makes many demands of the viewer.  Basically it is an examination of medicine and science absent of ethics.  The film's conceit is that humans are cloned and indoctrinated to grow and accept at a certain age that they are to be organ donors.  Now to accept this thesis we have to accept that the clones will go along willingly and unquestioningly without attempting to escape this fate.  My first impulse to say to the primary clones, Kathy(Carey Mulligan), Ruth (Keira Knightley), and Tommy (Andrew Garfield) is to run.  Instead in the stiff upper lip tradition of the British the trio go along with the program without exercising free will.  Suspension of disbelief is needed for this film to work and only then will you come to appreciate the glory and fragility of the human condition.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|If u enjoy action fantasy and some sick monster battles. I really recommend this book. So get it now!!!!! Bye
B009186JYI|3.0|It's no wonder the release of this film lay dormant for decades.  The concert footage is terrible.  You would never know the Stones are putting on a good show with the way director Peter Whitehead stations his camera.  It just doesn't move from the left side of the stage minimizing the excitement.  The vocals are barely audible so you have to strain your ears to hear them.  The backstage segments are a little better with the lads extolling on the vicissitudes of being pop stars.  I did get a kick out of Mick Jagger taking cheeky shots at their \\"rivals\\", the Beatles.  Regardless, for completists only and others beware.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I think t his book was awesome because  even though the book had  fighting it had heart. I think the Greek mythology was better but I still liked the story and the characters. I would recommend this book to everyone I know.
B008B3MZNI|5.0|Supertramp's Live in Paris has always been one of my all time favorite albums. It is by far one of the best live performances I have seen! This Blu-ray concert is excellent all around, great sound and clarity for a concert filmed in 1979. If you are a Supertramp fan, you will love this concert!
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|On Kindle Tablet,  works fine on Kindle Fire,  some other apps won&#34;t work, but this is fun , realistic easy to use...
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What an amazing book? I haven't cried so much reading a book in years. This book is a must read. The story was not what I expected and it took me awhile to purchase the book to read. I read the book in one day. I couldn't put it down. The characters are so real and Colleen makes you feel their pain and joy. Words can't describe. Must read.
B009LK6JS2|1.0|On Kindle Tablet, The picture flips upside down for no reason, turn the tablet right side up and the picture flips up-side down again...

1884883303|4.0|I own all the Vintage Guitar Price Guides back to 1992 as well as all the Blue Books of Guitar values and many of the Orion Blue Books.  The Vintage Guitar Price Guide has the most accurate prices and is the most up-to-date for VINTAGE instruments.  This is because it has the largest and most active group of contributors, mostly due to the fact that it is published by Vintage Guitar Magazine.  The chief criticisms I've seen are that it doesn't list many recent makes and doesn't include many lower-end guitars.  It also occasionally has scant info on some makers.  This is because the guide is specific to vintage guitars, as defined by the editors.  They do an excellent job in the over $1000 market, which is their main focus.  I do not think that the emergence of ebay or mega-dealers has in any way reduced this guide's accuracy.  If you look at \\"asking prices\\" on auction and retail sites, VGPG seems a bit low.  However, the Guide explicity avoids this pitfall, relying instead on verified sale prices, mostly from brick and mortar sellers, but also from online sellers.  If you compare prices in VGPG with other guides, you'll find that VGPG updates their prices more often and is the most responsive to data from recent sales.  To be frank, if you're going to shell out for a vintage guitar, the price you pay will be far more a function of the condition and playability of the instrument than what the guides say.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This was so easy to download onto my pc.  I got to see the entire series for only $11. Great bargin. The series itself is fabulous acting and I loved the period costomes. The British do this kind of stuff well.
B0053KWDES|5.0|I have the E11 with the 30 pin output cable and am listening to B&W P5's.  I was listening to Joe Satriani through the iPad's headphone out and it sounded more than a little thin throughout.  I remembered that I had the FIIO in my bag and plugged it in.  It was an amazing difference.  I tried to up the bass a little using the EQ switch.  From 0 to 1 setting, it got a little better bass balance, but seemed a little \\"thick\\" sounding.  It was clearer set at 0.  Some music sounds better with a little more bass and I can live with the change, but mostly having the EQ out is much better.  Hope that helps.  I can't see how another headphone amp competes at this price.  Would probably like to see the input and output jacks on opposite sides.  There is also a buzz audible at very low levels, but not in normal use.  That's it.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I only wish there were more free colors to choose from. Some words are obscure, so please add more free bombs!
B008ASGP3U|2.0|I eagerly await each of Rankin's novels because he is a master of the craft.  However, this book was sorely disappointing.  He is such a good writer that even an unsuccessful attempt by him is equal to the work of most bestselling authors, but I expect more from Rankin.  Compared to his other work, this book was extremely slow moving. Very little drama, very little conflict, no big surprises. Rebus seems kind of pathetic and his relationship with Siobhan is no longer fun or even very interesting.  It really seemed like he was writing on auto-pilot, which is still better than most humans can write, but does a disservice to his talent.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I play 2-5 games every night and it's awesome not to have to shuffle and lay out cards myself. Lol
B003WUYOQ6|3.0|Taubes, in both his books, makes some good points.  I learned some new things and noted a few avenues to research further...but OMG, I felt like I was reading the same paragraph over and over in so many places.  I kept turning pages back thinking, \\"didn't I just read this same thing?\\"  Do editors even touch the books they publish anymore?
B004QSQML8|4.0|Highly stylized fantasy adventure film.  The Director's Cut is beautiful and features one of my favorite film scores by Jerry Goldsmith.  Highly recommended!
B0038UNNBM|5.0|I was looking for an inflatable pool so storage in the wintertime would be easier. This one is great. We don't have any shade trees in our backyard so the rainbow shade is essential. My daughter loved splashing around and I didn't have to worry about her getting too much sun.
B002APU580|4.0|I loved this movie.  I had never been exposed to the story of Pride & Prejudice before watching this movie, so it was a welcome surprise.  Sure, I remember when the movie came out and I had no desire to see it because I thought it was a boring, stuffy old british film like the others.  Fortunately, I was wrong!  This movie is very modern for being a period piece.  There is never a moment when you're taken out of the movie through boredom.  Highly recommended!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is the best alarm clock app in the appstore. I love how the alarm starts out nice and quiet and gets louder progressively. Very peaceful way to wake up.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|What is there to say that hasn't been said before?  Leo and Kate shine.  The special effects still hold up today (and dare I say looks better than movies being released lately).  Brilliant direction from James Cameron.  One of the most iconic and beautiful film scores ever created.  It all looks and sounds better on blu ray!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|So far I am very happy with the quality of this app. Only a few weeks of use, but it's helpful and reliable and problem free. I feel it's an integral part of the kindle experience.
B0098VXE50|4.0|My experience with the story of Snow White had been limited to the old Disney feature length cartoon, and taking pictures of the Snow White character with my granddaughter at Disneyland.  I was lukewarm about purchasing this movie when my wife decided that it would be fun to see.  (translation, she likes Chris Hemsworth).  Well, I have given this movie Four Stars because I really did enjoy it!  Although I could have come up with someone who was actually &#34;fairer&#34; than Charlize Theron, I thought Kristen Stewart did a pretty good job as Snow White.  Both the story and the action kept my attention throughout, and I can recommend this movie as a good use of your entertainment time.  Overall, a very pleasant surprise!
B005LAJ17M|4.0|Top notch TV drama. It contains some very exlicit content and is unsuitable for children. But for adult intrigue enthusiasts it is really entertaining.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|I thought the book was amazing in that it was humorous, and at the same time was educational.  It would<br />make a very good movie.<br /><br />The 100-Year Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared
B005LAIIQC|5.0|Renner is powerful in the Bourne surrogate role, and the film is action packed. Highly recommended. Contains some violence, but it is tastefully done.
B00APUYWYA|2.0|I'd rather watch Glee where there is at least a message or two, better singing, and more talent in one episode than there was in this entire movie.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Kept my interest on edge.  Up to date with what's going on i  the world.  Recommend this book for all to read.
B009VB9VKY|3.0|After all the advertising I was bored of the movie half way through, the skin was good and body lived up to the review but nothing to hold the attention
B00B26DWN8|5.0|Amazing, absolutely flawless, welcome back. The characters are three-dimensional and interesting, but in the end, it is all about Sam and Dean. As it should be.<br /><br />The storytelling in season 8 is amazingly well-crafted, and the score/music selection makes the whole thing flow like a true composition.<br /><br />In short, perfect.
B007XIC1GI|3.0|Marilyn Manson is, to me, an interesting character. I got this book to get to know him better and I sure did. This is not for sissies this book and is really almost a tell all. Marilyn speaks about himself, his life growing up and some of the more famous and infamous on the rock scene. A decent read.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Couldn't  put it down. Felt like I was right there with the characters. Ready for the next part of the story.
B009YU6FJM|5.0|Then you'll love this CD. I keep waiting for Deftones to make a crappy CD. It hasn't happend yet. Buy it.
B004EAFQG0|5.0|I had never heard of this movie until this afternoon when my undergraduate students and I were discussing the Manti Te'o scandal at Notre Dame in my Human Computer Interaction course.  Several of the students are devotees of the television show, and mentioned that there is also a movie by the same name.  I decided to check it out since it sounded intriguing.<br /><br />This is a well-told story of how new technologies, and notably the Internet, have changed interpersonal relationships and sense of identity in our society.  That may sound a bit \\"academic,\\" but the movie raises some real issues about the influence of technology on individuals and on our relationships with others.  It also exposes some of the dangers of meeting strangers online and of developing online relationships with others who may be disguising their identities for one reason or another.<br /><br />On a personal level, I did feel sorry for Nev and for Angela, the woman who perpetrated the hoax.  Both are sympathetic characters.  That in itself raises interesting questions about our need for social relationships and the lengths to which people will go to fulfill that need.<br /><br />Will I be showing this movie in class?  Well, the answer is yes since I think that it is a fascinating movie that raises many issues that are important to address today in what is becoming a technology-mediated society.  Both in my Management of Information Systems and my Human Computer Interaction courses.  There is much food for thought here.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Steve Jobs' life story is in my opinion mind-blowing. This book is captivating, inspiring and a must-read for all Apple lovers!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I usually really enjoy Mr. Grisham's books; however, this one was only okay.  For some reason I could not get invested in the characters - I felt removed from them, not really involved in their story.  I hate to say it but I didn't really care whether things worked out for them or not.  Based on the author's comments about the book and his lack of research, it seems he also had a lack of real committment to this book, and it showed.
B004ZG5F0K|5.0|I have already watched this three times.  Sad but an awesome movie, acting was great and have already recommended it to others.
B0070YDOT8|3.0|the games are not up to date with the real slots in casino's--need to at least have a couple of games that are like going to the casino.
B0015AARJI|1.0|I recently got the PS3 and was really looking forward to getting a 2nd DualShock3 Sixaxis! Unfortuantly the description of \\"Like New\\" was far from legitimate. this was obvious as I unwrapped it finding gunk and dirt in several cracks of the controller. I prayed that the Dualshock rumble would work. NOOO, NOOO RUMBLE that entire aspect missing leaves the controller useless for all enjoyment of the game.I must get my money back so I can purchase a controller that works.
B006LSZECO|3.0|A little hard to get started, was really good mid-way through. I hated the ending....I wanted to throw my Kindle at the wall when I realized I had just read the last page. I was like, &#34;That's it?!&#34; Pretty good book though
B00908DDZM|4.0|If you love this sound then you have to check out Dark Time Sunshine!  Hip hop with soul and meaning...
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I love Bruno Mars and he did NOT disappoint with this album. So worth the money :) At first I was skeptical about buying a CD with all the crappy music out nowadays, but again, I was completely surprised as to how much I enjoyed it. If I could give this album 1000 stars, I would!
B009V3KKXY|5.0|This is a great book for anyone who wants to learn how to make tee parachute cord knots and bracelets.....I love it
B005K17RU0|4.0|It&acute;s clean and easy to use. Pleasant to look at and it tells me the weather forecast. Id say its doing what it&acute;s supposed to.
B003YGSLDA|4.0|Santa Claus was first movie my daughter saw in a theatre so this was a true nostalgia kick and something she can share with her first child.
B000V63BN6|5.0|Stevie is the best and all his hits are here. Buying MP3 &#34;CDs&#34; online is like playing the stock market. I check in on my wish list and wait until the price comes down to what I'm willing to pay. This one was not on my list but was a great deal. I'll put prices I'm will to pay for MP3 versions/CDs in my wish list comments. Someday the computer, someday if not now Amazon will be able to detect this and then send me the low option to buy, When that day comes I buy...
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I got the free version first and loved it. I had to buy the premium edition! Even though most of the sounds I like we're on the free version, (and some on here are just weird, &quot;vacuum&quot;?) I still like having so many options. It really does help me sleep. Money well spent.
B008M36EEI|4.0|Blunt and macgregor are in rare form and have a lovely chemistry. Not the best of the year by any chance, but fun to watch.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I choose this rate of this book up to five stars it's a book what where you could check The we stuff in case you need things such as a dictionary and I encased . If you need a word to spell
B005IQ39AY|5.0|I am totally addicted to this game. I love that there are two versions you can play so if I get tired of one version I can always play the other. Great way to spend time!
B004M9AS3Y|5.0|This bag can easily fit my SLR, about three prime lenses, and a small speedlite. I also carry my iPad and, if I'm going for an extended trip, I can stuff a notebook computer in there, too.<br /><br />For a small bag, it's surprisingly capacious. It really is great for travel, as it can fit everything but your clothes. It even has a water bottle/umbrella holder.<br /><br />Some drawbacks: there are no lens compartments and there is no rain cover built-in.
B0095XPZBC|2.0|CBS in a rush to get this done as fast as possible has resorted to farming out the even number seasons to random studios instead of doing the work internally. While doing this they failed to set any real standard for what the studios had to achieve other than make it look HD.<br /><br />While Season 1 was more in line with the remastered TOS with updated planets that look fantastic etc. we see the opposite in Season 2. The Studio hired was lazy and it shows. Instead of lush looking planets we are left with 1980s era bitmap planets that look entirely out of place.<br /><br />Even worse the Studio hired to do this work was so lazy they could not even ensure shots were composited correctly so there is even a scene where the Enterprise is not placed properly and half the saucer section is missing even though the scene extends beyond where the missing saucer section is.<br /><br />LAZY LAZY LAZY and ultimately CHEAP. I almost feel required to recommend people only by the ODD number seasons as those are done in house.
B006FO3ERQ|3.0|There's a good story in here.  It would have been really good if he hadn't kept telling me what was going to happen before it actually happened.  I've read books that do that, where it works, but it doesn't here.
B008BD9SI8|5.0|Red country has a different kind of flavor compared to the first law books, but the rough humor and atmosphere is preserved. It is great to get to see ninefingers from an outside perspective. The thing about Abercrombie is that he can really depict the futility and pointlessness of brutality and still do it in a completely entertaining way. After reading his book one is filled with the feeling that the entire adventure was all for nothing. No great evil was defeated, wicked people remain wicked and your normal average Joe keeps on being average with all flaws and perks unchanged. Some good people die, some bad people survive and a lot of average people are caught in the middle.<br /><br />Violence is pretty much never justified and even though Red Country is filled with violence it is never for the greater good, the greater good simply doesn't exist in Abercrombies world (or in reality for that matter). Selfishness, greed and stupidity drives the story and no good deed goes unpunished for long. What keeps the book entertaining in the light of such pessimism is the great characters and the dark humor. Who can not love characters like Nicomo Cosca? Who can not at times identify with Temples cowardice and isn't there something appealing with Lambs resignation that violence is in his nature?<br /><br />A great read, it can be read without reading the first law trilogy but reading them first adds to the experience.
034580404X|1.0|This is basically porn, and unfortunately I did not find any &#34;entertainment value&#34; in this series whatsoever.  I do not recommend anyone having to force their way through this.
B0002O06N0|5.0|This isn't my favorite cd from the Black Keys but it's still great, it's older and you can tell in the music, it's more raw. I like it
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|What more can be said about Little Women?  This classic story of a family of six has warmed many hearts and it has warmed mine again.  As an adult, I am sure I feel differently about this book at age 64 than I did at age 10.  We women have come a long way and this book is a gentle reminder of all that has happened in 200 years.  My book group enjoyed reading about this feisty,, friendly family.
B0091LS07E|5.0|I love Alicia Keys, Thank you for the fast servic and great quality of the cd. No matter what she puts outs. She Rocks it. A+++ thanks, Dana

6305327041|2.0|Although this assemblage of vignettes was written and directed by four sets of folks, and features four sets of actors, it's uniformly unfunny throughout.  Everybody overacts like  crazy -- I assume because  they realize the material needs as much pumping up as it can get.  The most intriguing feature is Tim Roth's hypertwitchiness as he responds to each cue tossed at him with about six takes in rapid-fire succession.
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|I thank you for the fast service. and the good quality the cd was in. The music it's self was ok. But that's just me. A+++ thanks again, Dana

B003UBTX7C|3.0|Can't recommend because this was so far in my past reading that it does't resonate  a need to revisit although I may try to pick it up to read in the future.
B0018RWMNM|5.0|But only consider buying the blu-ray.  Since watching the original broadcast of Lonesome Dove in 1988, I have purchased this superb mini-series in VHS, laser disc and dvd formats - and both the audio and video quality of all of these formats was so poor as to make the viewing experience unacceptable for me - all of which makes me very happy to be able to say that I am thrilled with the quality of the Lonesome Dove blu-ray.<br /><br />There's nothing I can say about the series itself that hasn't already been said by other reviewers here, so I won't bother to review the film itself - other than to say it is simply top notch in every respect.  What has been lacking in previous releases in other formats has been the audio/video quality that this wonderful work deserved all along.  That is no longer the case.  The blu-ray transfer is awesome.  Lonesome Dove lives and can now be viewed as it should be.  It has been re-born thanks to blu-ray technology.  If you've been holding off on buying a new high def big screen set up, watching Lonesome Dove as it was meant to be seen is the best reason I can think of to do make your purchase now.  I watched it on a 70\\" Sony set-up and the best word to describe the experience is \\"amazing\\".
B007HACDLK|4.0|Compelling and easy to read - I don't like to put down a book written by Vince Flynn.  Hopefully this is one of many more books written by this amazing author.
B001ED7C58|4.0|I liked this soundtrack pretty well.  With most of the music featured on this CD, you can picture the events of the movie in your mind.  There is not much variety, as far as genre, but if  you're int he  mood from good Rock and pop rock, this is the CD for you. I was disappointed that my favorite song from Twilight 1 was NOT on the CD (Let Me Sign by Robert Pattinson).  I really really really wish they would've added that song, instead of &#34;Never Think&#34; by Robert Pattinson.  Although I liked &#34;Never Think&#34;-- It doesn't have the same gritty rawness that I love. My favorite song on the track is the first song, Super Massive Black Hole by MUSE.  It's a great way to get going in the morning.  I got the CD brand new from Amazon, so it came in perfect condition.

B0041D843M|3.0|On the negative side, the author leaps to conclusions from studies referenced in this book.  There are many more variables that might explain the outcomes.<br />On the positive side, this book opens up a dialogue about what we eat.  In the Western world we, all too often, take for granted that the food on the grocery store shelves is acceptable for us to eat.  Many people do not realize or take into consideration the ingredients that were included in the making and preserving of grocery items.  It's time for the general public to scrutinize what goes into their diet!  There is no doubt in my mind that our diet has and is affecting our general health as a population.  (There have been many banned substances in our foods over the years and recalls for contaminated foods as well). Sadly,  it appears, as long as there is money to be made, the &#34;junk food&#34; will continue to be shipped to our store shelves and people will continue to consume it..........but don't get me started.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Great film and pretty inexpensive. Came in a timely fashion and was packaged pretty tightly so no box damage with this purchase.

B001BR5NN0|5.0|I haven't gotten this in the mail yet (it should be here today) but I'm excited to share the movie with my little cousins (ages 13, 15, and 16). We just recently watched a movie that referenced the 80s hit and they now want to see it. I loved this movie growing up.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|The bounce flash made all the difference in softening portrait shots and close photos such as a small room. I love it.

B000JQUHLM|4.0|Having watched the movie, &#34;Pollyanna&#34;, several times, I enjoyed seeing and hearing the characters in my head.  It starts out with Pollyanna the young girl she was in the movie.  As the book progresses we see her grow up and the &#34;Glad Game&#34; is still part of her.<br /><br />This was a good book to just take a mini vacation from the every day and a good reminder to try to find something good in everything.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I would recommend this book for everyone who does not value time for what it is.  It is the most valuable asset that we have.
076790592X|5.0|I enjoy reading books of self-help and motivation, and what I really enjoyed was the storytelling narrative that went along with the powerful lessons.

B00991TCOG|5.0|My husband and I first heard Lindsey preform with The Piano Guys (also a huge favorite) in their \\"Mission: Impossible\\" video. Then we started hearing her music on The Piano Guys Pandora station. We were hooked! We purchased her album a few days later and it's listened to at least once a day. One amazingly talented young lady! Can't wait to see (hear) what she comes up with next. Keep up the great work, Miss Stirling!
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|This book is enjoyable as long as you don't take it too seriously. Like AT ALL seriously. I kind of hate myself for liking this book at all but I can't help it. I read it in two days. I gave it 3 stars because regardless of all the stuff I hated about, it I can't deny that I will probably be reading Walking Disaster when it comes out. **Hangs head in shame**<br />One review I read on GoodReads summed it up quite well - This book is like crack; you feel like S*** for reading it, but you can't stop.<br /><br />The relationship between Abby and Travis was really quite scary and I sincerely hope that no one reading this book actually wishes for a relationship like that. (But when I see reviews from girls saying they're in love with Travis or can't wait until they find someone like him, my hope kind of goes out the window.)<br /><br />Random thought: did anyone else find it weird/funny how the university was small enough to have cafeteria gossip (really? in college?) but large enough to have fraternities and sororities? Doesn't make sense.<br /><br />SPOILERS!!<br />While I can't deny that it was highly entertaining, there were a lot of things about this book that I didn't care for AT ALL. I REALLY hated the ending and I disliked how Travis got away with beating up all those people when a lot of them didn't deserve it. The only guy that did deserve it was Ethan, but even the way Travis handled that was disturbing. Smashing a headlight with the guys face? Whoa. Travis never really solved his anger and violence issues (and crazy jealousy). And Abby was totally fine with it. She even encouraged him at one point to attack someone for making a joke about her. WTF? Oh and then she tattoos his name on her and gets married at 19? Whoa. Serious WTF moment there. Grrr.... At least it wasn't a boring read, I guess!

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|WOW! I am an avid reader and I read all different types of genres. When I first saw this book I thought I probably would not care for it. I was so wrong! This was one of the best books I have ever read! The story was wonderful and this author has great talent. I rank him up there with Stephen King and the other greats. When I finished the book I was so surprised this was his first novel. Please continue to write Mr. Cline. Thanks for such a great reading experience.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I stayed up till 2am just to read one more chapter. Now that I've finished the book, I find myself missing sky and holder. The bond that they share and the love they have for each other is amazing. I felt all the emotions they were going through. The friendship, the playfulness, the arguments, the passion, the heartache, and the healing were so real. I want to read it again because I'm not ready to be done with this story.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Excellent book - great ending!  Highly recommend this series of books. Couldn't put my kindle down anticipating what would happen next.

B00AB0AR2U|2.0|This movie was just one action scene after another. The action is good/similar to previous resident evils but the plot is extremely thin/non-existent. Also some of it was too much like video game cutscenes. When I watch a movie, I want to see a movie - not video game cutscenes.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I couldn't agree more when I heard that Fifty Shades was modern day &#34;mommy porn&#34;, but I also think that these books have an amazing, hanging on the edge of your seat type love story. Truly amazing. Can't wait for E.L.James to come up with more tantalizing & thrilling stories of Christian and Anastasia.
0321885112|5.0|Austin Kleon`s recommended reading list in his book Steal Like an Artist continues to yield real gems.  Lynda Barry's What It Is is the first from Austin's list that I read and I loved it.  Sketchnotes by Mike Rohde is next on the list.<br /><br />Here's my sketchnote of what resonates with me from Mike's book: [...]<br /><br />I have taken notebooks full of notes but I can't stand to read them. Mike felt handwritten notes fell short also. I needed a different way to do it and have struggled for some time to find something I'm comfortable with. I take notes so that I can learn better what I'm hearing by engaging in the subject kinesthetically. Rohde points out that taking notes as pictures and words takes advantage of something called dual coding.  We get the verbal by writing the words.  We get even more by making visuals. I tried it out and I love it!<br /><br />If you ask most adults to draw they panic. Mike defangs drawing by focusing down to 5 basic shapes: square, circle, triangle, line and dot.  Mike shares a technique that a friend taught him of drawing different facial expressions easily and simply to prove that drawings don't have to be \\"art\\".<br /><br />Sketchnoting makes everything more interesting!

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great story about young love and emotions.  I think the would appeal to more women than men.  With the rise of snatching children this story ends with a good realistic ending.  I would love a to read a sequel about &#34;Sky/Hope and Holder.&#34;

1457514508|4.0|The only decent characters in this book debut are the various pooches, who wag their tails, jump with joy and love their unlovable owners. The reader confronts the dogs with relief-the poodles Grit and  Biscuit, Shmitty the Labrador, Chalky the Cairn, Fuchsl the German Pointer and other exemplary canines who are exactly what they seem.<br /><br />\\"Walking\\" is a satirical novel. Even some of the names such as Carla Zipp and Cindy Mopper are tongue in cheek and evoke some kind of connotation such as zipper and mopping up. Author Whitehead ridicules female rivalries, class snobbery, male chauvinists and even plastic surgery.<br /><br />Three dog walking ladies who meet in the park and chug-a-lug martinis out of paper cups while their various pooches run free form the nucleus of the novel. Their friend Thelma has just died leaving a highly desirable husband, Elliott, who is running for mayor. One of the ladies, Carla, when poor Thelma is hardly cold, immediately sneaks into a hospital to have mountainous breast implants. Will a pair of new boobs across the street attract the widower? You bet! The two are in the hay quite promptly.<br /><br />Everybody in the novel has his own agenda fueled by greed, and narcissistic self absorption and secrecy. What you see is what you get applies to only the dogs. The main setting is in Gordonston, a suburb of Savannah, which turns out to be a den of iniquity.<br /><br />The novel begins with a man digging a four foot deep grave in a local park. Why four feet and not the usual six? Who is the digger and who of the town's motley assortment of frauds  deserves to be four feet under? As you will learn, virtually everybody qualifies as a candidate for bumping off in a contract killing. And the murder will definitely be orchestrated by the Mob. There is one man, though, apart from the Savannah characters who stands alone. He is Senor Kurtze whom Elliott had met while in Argentina years ago. The Austrian ( or perhaps Swiss) Kurtze is venerated and loved throughout Buenos Aires as a writer of superb children's stories, a benefactor, a philanthropist. He and Elliott become fast friends and Kurtze leaves a book for Elliott with his author's signature on the second page. He attached a note:\\"Do not judge me for what I was but for what I am now.\\" It's significant that Kurtze was an Austrian and that Elliott is Jewish.<br /><br />Whitehead introduces many inept characters along with the female dog-walkers. Eighty year old German-born Heidi keeps a shrine behind locked doors, a memorial to her very famous very infamous  Uncle. Tom and Kelly are married, both beautiful to look at, but she is a birdbrain and he is a chauvinistic jerk and they both cheat on each other. Doug and Veronica are another couple with an adorable toddler, Katie, but Veronica works and he is a house-husband. Doug is British, and educated so why does  not find a job? There's an elderly African-American man who visits the park daily to walk his dog Chalky. He gets in trouble with the ladies because he doesn't pick up Chalky's deposits even though a free poop-scoop is available- and they write him an indignant letter.<br /><br /> \\"Gordonston\\" is quite a cauldron of seething passions. Author Whitehead weaves the strands of the story  together somewhat loosely, but only one guy is bumped off, and through the machinations of the town's virulent haters, organized crime was contracted to off  three  more citizens. So the ending is not tidy, a great deal is left up in the air, and I imagine there will be a sequel.ed and loved throughout Buenos Aires as a writer of superb children's stories, a benefactor, a philanthropist.

He gets in trouble with the ladies because he doesn't pick up Chalky's deposits even though a free poop-scoop is available- and they write him an indignant letter.<br /><br /> \\"Gordonston\\" is quite a cauldron of seething passions. Author Whitehead weaves the strands of the story  together somewhat loosely, but only one guy is bumped off, and through the machinations of the town's virulent haters, organized crime was contracted to off  three  more citizens. So the ending is not tidy, a great deal is left up in the air, and I imagine there will be a sequel.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Flash Gordon is great in this movie and its definetly a guy movie. Beer and pizza helped make this funny.
B00A757EFW|5.0|I loved playing  Pac Man & Ms. Pac Man back in the 80's. This app brings those fun memories back, and the directional controller on the Kindle makes it as user-friendly as the arcade versions. Great for passing the time whilst in the waiting room, etc. Highly recommend.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|This was my favorite book of the series! Wish it wasn't over, maybe there will be more sequels in the near future?

B000FCKGPC|4.0|Great continuation of story, but the POV characters aren't as &#34;sexy&#34; as those featured in the concurrent &#34;Dance with Dragons&#34;. Makes the reader fly through this book in anticipation of the one to come.

B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Dark Knight Rises was woven with many sub-plots and intertwining stories that kept the mind active and the heart pumping with action packed scenes.  Grandmothers would enjoy t more if there were captions for the hearing impaired.

B000JIHP88|3.0|After putting fresh batteries in this mobile the leaves and animals don't spin and move as described.  We may have a bad unit as we can &#34;help&#34; it along with a tap of our finger but that is weak.  Even though it doesn't move it has enough wow or busy-ness for our 4 month old to enjoy looking at it.
B008X9Z37A|3.0|Good.  I wished it had a better way to hold tablet inside. Has fallen out a couple of times.  But overall, it is a good case.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|But this is honestly the best book in the teen category I've read.  The book has perfect character development, a thrilling plot, and perfect pacing.  I never understood the appeal of this series until I decided to read the book.  I honestly can't recommend it enough.

0545101417|4.0|Enjoy this book on CD as I have and then I donated it to the local library.  This hit series is just what everyone said it was .... great
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|The main thing I didn't like was when given the option to buy there was no warning that if you logged out at that time you would have to start at the beginning if not purchased at that time.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I didn't intend to read this book. A friend started reading it and gave up. I wondered why. The beginning was a  little slow (I think that is why she gave up on it.), but once it got going, it was great. I finished The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and went right on to the other two books in the trilogy. I loved the writing style, loved the characters, loved the fact that I didn't see the plot's twists and turns coming. My favorite books are ones where I can't predict what is coming next.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I love this mouse! Everything on the mouse works amazingly, from the dpi switch to the weights. When I unboxed it the mouse was really light (maybe because I used an older expensive Microsoft mouse) and I thought I would throw it off my desk, but the weights In it feel nice. The on the go dpi hot key is nice, and all the buttons form perfectly to my hand. A+ 5 stars, I would recommend this mouse to anyone!<br />TL:DR - great mouse for the money, feels like a razer or steel series, and has great software.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|After trying this cable with various usb plugs, in various outlets around the house, it DOES NOT WORK!!! The cable doesn't even connect my Kindle Fire (2nd gen) to my pc. The cable itself is in new condition and though it fits the Kindle Fire plug, it's a complete d-o-a dud. Very frustrated and disappointed in this purchase, but as it was a small purchase I'll chalk it up to a lesson learned.<br /><br />For all of those who received a working cable, good for you! For everyone else, be aware you may be sent a non-working cable!
0525423281|4.0|This is going to seem like an odd way to start a review.  Usually, I begin with why I chose the book, but at the moment I am struck by all the reasons I would not normally have chosen this book though I obviously did choose it, read it and not only that I liked it.<br /><br />Bet you're wondering what would turn me off such a book.  Well first of all, its Young Adult Contemporary Romance.  However, I would venture to say that a goodly portion of the book might fall into General Fiction because it is about the struggles of a high school age girl working out who she is and learning to be comfortable in her own skin.  The next thing was that the before mentioned confused heroine was also confused about two guys she loves and in the process flits back and forth not able to make up her mind.  And finally, this girl's life is just full angst and in the confusion, she looses her compass and starts ignoring those who offer sound advice and lashing out at those who truly love and support her.<br /><br />Now if you were paying attention, you'll notice I said words like 'not normally' and 'would turn me off'.  That's right it didn't manage to do that.  I actually liked it and saw it through to the end with a fisted double hand pump into the air when a couple of things resolved and Lola came into her own.<br /><br />Seventeen year old Lola's life seems to be going along swimmingly.  She is a very avant guarde girl who takes fashion and pushes it past fad-ish into costume dressing.  Each day an original outfit that is eye popping bright and over the top is worn to wow anyone she comes in contact with.  She plans to go to the school winter dance dressed as Marie Antoinette wig, undergarments and all. She has good friends, loving parents, a hot rocker guy, Max, for a boyfriend who doesn't meet with parental approval and she plans on the day when she can move with her boyfriend to LA where he'll rock on and she'll pursue designer school.<br /><br />But one bright sunny day, none of this matters because she observes the moving trucks pull up to the lavender Victorian house next door which has sat vacant or filled with temporary leasers.  She knows what that means- their back.  The twins Calliope and Cricket have returned.  The two people who are responsible for acute hurt and pain two years previous have returned with their family to take up life as her neighbors again.  Calliope is a world class amateur figure skating champion and her twin is a quiet science geek who now will only be home on weekends from university. Calliope remains hostile just as she was two years before, but Cricket is an enigma.  He has changed and wants a do-over of sorts.  He's willing to take things slow and take whatever she will give him.  He is honest about his feelings and what he wants.  Lola recognizes the difference between Cricket's honest and her own lack of honesty when dealing everyone in her life.<br /><br />The return of Cricket sets off a series of changes for her it seems even if he was not directly responsible for most of it.  First, she has confusing feelings about Cricket, then things get complicated with her boyfriend when her lies and the confusion it causes builds walls for them, then her mom turns up with more issues and needs than ever, and finally Lola starts to go through a personally identity crisis of sorts- she doesn't know who she is any more and doesn't like who she seems to be becoming.  It all comes crashing down around her shoulders, but it is at this point that Lola has a choice: draw strength from those who love her and take a step back to get an honest look at herself and her recent decisions or cling to what she knows just because it is what she knows while remaining mired in denial and self-pity.<br /><br />The story revolves around the main character Lola and is told first person point of view from her perspective.  Lola is such a complex character that I find myself unable to say just a few short lines and move on.  Lola's lifeis made up of equal parts components that are universally relate-able to anyone who has lived through the ages of thirteen to eighteen years of age and components that are so far from my point of reference that I could only shake my head as her background was revealed.  Her life should have been one unstable mess and I'm not referring to the fact that she has two dads.  Actually, that was one of her strongest areas of stability along with her grounded set of friends.  The girl isn't just adopted; her parents were two homeless peeps that suffer from more than one addiction and mental health issue. And both are still periodically in her life.  Lola's method to combat the feelings of inferiority and acceptance is to hide behind her outrageous costumes so the real Lola cannot be rejected because the real Lola cannot be seen.  It is almost a litmus test to determine the true character of the people around her.  Those who really love and support her accept the vibrant, quirky Lola whether she is in costume or not.<br /><br />I always have to comment when an author of a YA does a good job of making the parents more than absentee background figures or the stupid people for which the 'brilliant' young teenager must take care.  Lola's dads were very present and they were firm, but loving.<br /><br />Cricket was a fun character.  I loved it whenever he opened his mouth.  He is so into Lola that he has trouble forming complete sentences.  He is just so refreshingly honest and a warm strong support whether it is within his family or with his friends.  His love was the unselfish kind that just wanted the best for Lola as he sat on the sidelines patiently waiting and hoping that she would finally see him beyond the glamor and cool bad-boy image of her rocker boyfriend.<br /><br />This is not a light-hearted coming of age read, but one of that has the feel of authenticity as it runs the gamut of experiences and feelings in a teen's life.  I do not recommend this for younger teens as there is language and the unhealthy relationship that Lola has with Max who is older and into more adult things.  But for older teens and adults, this would appeal to those who enjoy reading a girl come into her own and find something good with the boy next door.is made up of equal parts components that are universally relate-able to anyone who has lived through the ages of thirteen to eighteen years of age and components that are so far from my point of reference that I could only shake my head as her background was revealed.

B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|It was an amazingly written story. Beautiful story mixed with tradgy. Once you start reading it you just can't put it down.
B00003CX8N|5.0|What a memorable film!  Fantastic acting by all characters, especially Anne Bancroft and Anthony Hopkins, who never actually<br />meet, yet are \\"in love\\" intellectually.  I am happy to have a copy of this movie so I can watch it any time.  Wonderful, won-<br />derful acting by Bancroft--sometimes so sweetly subtle and sometimes boisterously \\"New York.\\"  Such a love affair with<br />books shared by writer Bancroft and bookseller Hopkins!  They are brought together by their passion for  books across two continents, and they remind us of how powerful is the written word and how important is friendship, wherever we find it.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|A well written, fantastic story that jumps seamlessly from hilarious to heartbreaking. The jumping perspective can be a bit off-putting at first, but once you get used to it, it's fun, and pays off in the end. Especially recommended for fans of Punchdrunk and Sleep No More, which apparently helped inspire the author. In particular, she perfectly captures the particular brand of fandom and admiration I have not experienced anywhere else.
B00AE2IJIE|2.0|This was too scary for my 6 year old and some of the references were too adult. I typically like animated films, but this one not so much.
B007SGM084|5.0|There really is a wonderful story that overshadows all the sex. I really enjoyed the relationship between the characters and the love they find.
B00004XMSN|5.0|Enjoyed The Bishop's Wife very much.  Older movies are the best! I will order more in the near future; : I will check out titles.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I see what all the talk is about.  Downton Abbey is addictive!  I love the time period, costumes, scenery.  I love it!

B004I1AGTC|5.0|Whether you like Kung Fu or your boyfriend likes it and you just want to be supportive, Ip Man is the way to go. A good plot, storyline, and meaningful story with historical context, a love story about family ties, a touch or humor, and most importantly kick ass fight scenes!
B008NMT684|5.0|the kids love the game and its easy for the little kids pic up on and my grandson love popping the balloons when he gets it right

B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love the game color is great its easy to play easy to see like the different shapes the tiles come in
B001LF3YQK|5.0|I have had this wipes case since my 3 year old was a baby(am getting ready to use it for my 3rd child!)! I agree with the previous reviewer! I have had no trouble opening this case! You kinda have to push the button down and then slide it open! I can do this easily one handed! The case holds a lot of wipes and I haven't had trouble with them drying out either! It snaps shut securely and keeps the wipes moist! I kept it in my diaper bag when my 3 year old was in diapers and it served me well! Will definitely be a diaper bag staple for this baby as well! My case is 3 years old and it is still in great condition! It is a durable wipes case that functions as it should! Love it!
B005HSL626|5.0|love it and the grandchildren can play it and they love it the kids play the game a good bit
B00003CY6M|5.0|I love this movie. I also believe in. When events line up this perfect, it's no longer a coincidence, it's a gift from God
B009X00E18|3.0|This cover looks and feels cheap and flimsy which can be off putting<br />when looking at the price tag.  However it does seem to be pretty<br />durable despite my first impression. It is very light weight and<br />doesn't add much weight or bulk to the device which may be what the<br />manufacturer was aiming for.  My personal preference is to have a<br />prettier, more substantial feeling case but this might please the more<br />minimalist minded Kindle users.  I think it would be perceived as a<br />better deal if it was priced lower.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|Hard to put into words, but for a neophyte of philosophy and a student of life this read is possibly the best foundation (after the Bible) on which to build a working understanding of what life means.
1401937268|5.0|I purchased 3 sets of the angel Tarot Cards - 2 for gifts that were both well received and one for me which I have really enjoyed!  They are an inspiration to me!  I love them and the 2 dear friends that I bought them for are equally as happy with the cards.
B000XXGMS8|4.0|Like many people suggested and I ignored, go down one size unless you plan on wearing thick socks! The boots are very sturdy and have a &#34;worker&#34; look to them. I've had them for 2 weeks now, and the stitching on the tongue is already coming loose. I don't want to go through the hassle of returning them and waiting again, so I am willing to live with it. Other than that, I really can't complain because they still feel and look great. No insoles needed, I am on my feet for 8 hours a day and haven't had any problems yet...besides smelly feet, but that's my fault :) haha. I have not tested to see how waterproof they are, but can't wait for the Chicago snow to try it...I will probably regret writing that.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|nice graphics. challenges are fun. it's fun making neighbors. my grandchildren enjoy playing it. easy to play. it's fun to design your restaurant.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Reading about the zombie apocalypse from the perspective of the people who lived it gave me a renewed interest in the same tired old tale. Puts the human element back in.
1451696191|5.0|This is such a awesome book. It does have some mature scenes but i would recommend this boom to a lot of people
B0036OS3ME|5.0|The same way regular Crocs slip on are durable these boots are the same. They are warm and very comfortable. My fiancee has them in white. They are very easy to clean. The only issue I would say about Crocs that my fiancee regular shoes size is 7 1/2 but she took them 1/2 size small because they do run a little big.
B000089A06|5.0|i am very satified with the product i recived it defenetly meet the discription and creteria of it i really liked it and defenetly recomend it
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|Works pretty good. It takes some practice. What worked best for me is pouring hot water on the bottle slowly and then running it under cold water. Takes about 1 min. And Presto.
B002HFJ77S|5.0|I love this book so much, it will make you want to buy a dragonfly necklace! Please read this !
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|A very interesting read.<br />Fascinating information, I would say - an important read for any thinking person!<br /><br />The only down side is that the scientific language makes it quite a hard read. Used the built-in dictionary on every single page...
B004XMMSZG|5.0|Quick Summary:  Quality sounds, easy to use, works very well with Iphones and other bluetooth devices.<br /><br />Buy it.  I also recommend using this product with Spotify.

B00914JWSW|4.0|I enjoy the CD very much.  It is Streisand at her best with a combination of older and newer standards.
0525953728|5.0|This is quite a book and written by one of the original soldiers who was in on the &#34;kill&#34;.  Very interesting reading as it is a true story.
1451695195|5.0|I found this book to be incredible and would recommend it to anyone who has doubts that heaven exists.  True story of a doctor who experienced a life-threatening illness who has made it his mission to tell of his visit to the other side. A must read!
B0007MWZEK|5.0|I had the original one and the motor died.  Then I tried the newer Swivel Sweeper and it was a disaster in that the battery/motor contacts didn't connect correctly and would only work for no more than seven minutes.  I was totally giving up when I looked at Amazon and saw you had the original!!!  It works the way it should and it's great when you have a dog who tracks in everything on his feet.  Just grab the &#34;original Swivel Sweeper&#34; and you're done in a jiffy.  I highly recommend this to all.<br /><br />Absolutely love it but only 'THE ORIGINAL SWIVEL SWEEPER&#34;.  The newer version is nothing more than a piece of junk (crap).
B008YWY0HK|5.0|The movie was wonderful. I'm watching it all the time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time........
0762445262|4.0|I bought this item to add to my batman collection. Its small and cool looking, it does what its suppose to do. And the battery is included, the only downside to it was I was expecting it to light the bat symbol a little bit brighter but its still works pretty well. I would still recommend getting this item.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Follett's trilogy books are very lengthy but thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining.  The book makes for great book-club discussions and we're waiting for the third book.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|The simple question brings a complex answer here.<br />The question with \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" is obvious--is it as good as \\"The Dark Knight\\"??!?<br />The answer is \\"No\\"--but that is an answer that has to be considered in context.  \\"The Dark Knight\\" is arguably The Best Superhero Movie Ever; clearly is at or near the top of anyone's list in the genre.  It also is one of the best movies made in the first decade of the 21st century.<br />But when considered with movie series that have gone into two to three sequels, \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" is a high-quality effort; very much a worthy third act in Christopher and Jonathan Nolan's story of Bruce Wayne.  Take into account some of the recent \\"third chapters\\" we've seen--X-Men 3, Spider-Man 3, The Bourne Ultimatium; Superman 3 from the '80s, Rush Hour 3, Batman Forever from the Burton/Shoemaker set...TDKR sets itself above these movies because it follows the continuity of the first two movies--the path that the Nolans followed, their vision of Bruce and Gotham--and gave it a full and completed story.<br />Chris and Jonathan have been very good in combining parts and pieces of the great Batman stories of the last 25 years in this series.  Obviously, much of their vision of Wayne has been based on Frank Miller's \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\" throughout the trilogy; and there were strong elements of \\"The Killing Joke\\" in TDK as well as harbingers of the \\"No Man's Land\\" series from 1999.  TDKR--obviously--draws from both \\"Knightfall\\" and allows a reimaging of \\"No Man's Land\\" to come to fruition.  It wouldn't be a stretch to say that the Nolans REALLY liked the \\"No Man's Land\\" scenario.<br />But just as obviously, Chris and Jon also took great care with their imaging of The League of Shadows--in their real-world vision of The Bat, The League seems the perfect and best antagonist to this vision.  Tom Hardy's Bane, in turn, fits brilliantly.  Hardy captures much of what the character was when he was introduced--highly intelligent,uncompromisingly vicious.  Again, much credit goes to the Nolans, who have a capacity for getting actors who will physically mold themselves.  Christian Bale worked himself into good shape for all these movies.  Hardy becomes a powerful, intimidating presence as Bane; though his mask (The positive for the Blu-Ray/DVD set is that Hardy's lines--at times, unintelligible in the theater--were cleaned up for the disc release...) serves a different purpose than in the original story.  It's a great performance from Hardy, who has to do so much of it just with his eyes.<br />This movie allows for the actors that Chris and Jon rely on for good performances to step up--Joseph Gordon-Levitt's John Blake, the young Gotham police officer who knows who Bruce Wayne is/was and brings him back into the game; Marion Cotillard's Miranda Tate (\\"I'm sorry, but what was her name again...??!?\\"), and again, Hardy.<br />Bale's final turn as Bruce Wayne...is morose at first, with Bruce having become Howard Hughes in the aftermath of the Joker and Harvey Dent.  As I've said over the years, Chris and Jonathan see Bruce Wayne more as a person with multiple personas more than a person with a secret identity; and what Christian captures early is how not letting the Batman out has affected him.  Christian has been solid in his interpretation thoughout the trilogy.  What brings Bale's Wayne back to \\"The Game\\" are Gordon-Levitt's Blake--explaining what he knows about Bruce, how he knows, and the sudden direness of the situation; AND...<br />  Anne Hathaway's Selina Kyle.<br />  I cannot emphasize enough that Hathaway just kills it.  She brilliantly captures the modern-day Selina; sharp-tongued, skilled high-end jewel thief, top-end martial artist, protector of her neighborhood...and just drop-dead gorgeous, especially in her catsuit.  Kudos to the Nolans for the cat-eared goggles for Selina.  In interviews after the completion and release of the movie, Hathaway has wistfully talked about Selina, quietly imploring the Nolans to revisit her at some point.  Here's an open hope that the Nolans DO find a path back to her.<br />  Michael Caine's Alfred seems full of regrets here, and does not get as much screen time as in the first two.  Morgan Freeman's Lucius Fox is still the sly and intelligent inventor.  Gary Oldman has had a wonderful grip on Jim Gordon throughout.<br />  Again--\\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" is not on the level of its magnificent predecessor.  But it is a very, very good film; and a great completion to The Nolan Dark Knight Trilogy.<br />  Plus, it does leave some crumbs out there to lead to a new storyline.  So, bravo to Christopher and Jonathan; Christian, Michael, Gary, Morgan, Liam Neeson, Anne, JG-L, Tom, Marion...well done.<br />  Highly recommended.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Great book! Has lots of detail. Tells of scrooge who hates christmas and how his heart will begin to change
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really enjoyed this series and was honestly surprised how good it is.  This is my first Amazon review because this is the first book to inspire me to write a review.  It's more than just clever storytelling, it's also good writing.  I'd rank it up there along the likes of Alas Babylon or 1984.  Not only great books, but also thought invoking.  I don't give the 5 star ranking lightly ether, trust me nothing ticks me off more than Amazon's inflated ranking system, but this one is well deserved.
B005ZHB84U|4.0|This is a fabulous movie with plot twists, excitement and  CGI at it's best!  We enjoyed it so much. we just had to own it.  Thanks Amazon for your great price!

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Butterflies...I felt butterflies all throughout this book.  Let me say that very few books has done that to me.  Could not get  enough of this book...It was so intense yet so sweet at the same time.  Each words describing the character's emotions makes me feel like I am experiencing the same.  INCREDIBLE characters.  Loved them all.  Amazing plot with surprises that I did not see coming.  This book will take your emotions for a roller coaster ride.<br /><br />bookcrazyangel.blogspot.ca

B00AQMSJI2|5.0|I think the game is awsome so far and I really do enjoy it I will continue to play it some more good job on the game.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|Just as good as the first one, and maybe a little bit funnier ! they added Chuck Norris and as always hes a one man army. The movie is great and it has the attractive actors in it from my era!  HAHA  !!  They are still handsome
B003VS0CXS|5.0|Bought this for my 3 year old grandson. How can one go wrong getting this! He loves it, just like everyone does. Watches it over and over.
B0043RSJ8G|3.0|I love this author, love, love, love her work.  This book, however, was not a winner for me.  Normally her books make me laugh, cry and smile all in the same read.  This one did none of the above.  Nothing heart wrenching in this one and it took me days to finally get through it.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was very good. I hope this isn't the last book in this series. It was a lot shorter than I expected it to be, though. I finished it in less than a day!
1451695195|1.0|Almost no mention of Christianity.  No mention of relationship to Christ to achieve salvation.  How was he supposed to get to heaven if unsaved?
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book was definitely more detailed than the movie and you really get to see how Peeta feels about Katniss. His live and devotion to her as well as Katniss discovering herself and feelings she never thought she would have. Definitely can't wait to read the next books in this series.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|When I started this book I wasn't sure I would enjoy it since it was about a teenager, but it is such a good story, that I couldn't put it down.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|I've bought this for both my cousin and my brother. The first time I got this we didn't have anyone who knew how to play so the game pretty much got shelved. I had a friend show me how to play recently though and once I was able to teach my family we fell in love with the game. So fun!
B004ETVAH0|5.0|After seeing the DVD I had to get the CD. This really rocks. I wish more people my age know who Les Paul was. I’m so glad to experience his music through this cd.
B002ZG980U|4.0|I loved this movie when I saw it in theaters. So many twists and a fairly new plot. Well worth seeing.
1419702203|5.0|George Harrison was an icon but people don’t realize the deep spiritual side to this man.  Even if you are not a Beatles fan, you should watch it.
1401324029|4.0|I love the TV show Castle so I've bought a couple of the books based on the series. I've loved the ones I've read so I'm excited to read this one too.
B0052TDGQO|3.0|I took a chance on this since I loved his voice so much on American Idol. However, when singing others’ songs that are already popular, that makes a big difference than singing on a cd with new songs. Some people may have the voice but not the writers that can make or break them with their songs.
B0095EMOTM|3.0|Bought this for my brother for Christmas. Since it was specifically requested it was also very much enjoyed. Good gift.
B008Y5OW20|5.0|Love the simplicity of this CD and how Jeff Lynne chose some real great nostalgic numbers. I listen to it often.
B009RH973I|5.0|bought this as a gift for someone, i myself didn't see it since it was mailed directly to them, but it got there on time and they loved it!!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|If you like animals you will like this one. It's from different point of view, so you really see what we as humans take for granted. It's  interesting to see the loyalty in this story as well.<br />A must read. It's short. I had it finished in 2 days.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele's voice is god given.. What can you say about her and depth of her song writiing.  Enjoying the cd
B009346RSS|4.0|Tested it but haven't put it in place yet.  ...  ....  . . . . . .  . . .
B008HT4FUW|5.0|I really enjoy this series.  A great look into another world with characters you can become involved with.  Has a few extra features as well.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The narrative.<br />  Of the heroine is so descriptive that one  is there, watching from the sidelines. A really good twist on the evil futuristic society theme.
B007KZY1YY|4.0|I've written everything I feel is important about this product in the description and am just copying this because I don't want to have to come up with 20 or more words to describe all of the things I have purchased from Amazon.
030759565X|5.0|Have had this book for just over 2 months and have made a number of the recipes.  Our favorites are the mini meat loaves with brown butter mashed potatoes, (the potatoes were so good we made them with the thanksgicing turkey!) , the arugula mustard chicken, the leek fritters, the butternut squash galette, and a couple of the desserts...  You will love the pictures, and the blurbs preceeding the recipes are great fun.  The only recipe we didn't make just as written was the kale wild rice gratin...  Needs garlic, and a bit less rice, but then I think anything with kale is best with garlic!<br /><br />Recommend this book!  (and have given as a gift to very appreciative recipients!)
