B0015WJBR0|5.0|anyone that likes early genesis, yes, elp, camel, styx, or rush MUST BUY this album.  the instruments are well equalized so your ear is not overwhelmed with crashing cymbals or searing guitar.  the vocal harmonies are every bit as good as the beach boys. these guys are obviously a seasoned band rather than just random musicians thrown into a studio. the vibe is very sunny and lively throughout without the super fast runs neo-prog is often guilty of.  the lyrics are good for such young singers. warning: some of the songs are 10-20 minutes long but be patient...there is NO filler on this album.
1932100660|5.0|I want to buy this book for every fat person I know! it will change their lives.  Heck, the U.S. Government should subsidize this book and give it to every single overweight person in America for free. It will be far cheaper than the amount they spend on healthcare.  Every person I know who came to the U.S. from China or Japan always ends up gaining weight. No one ever loses weight when they come to America..  There is a reason Asians are mostly skinnier and healthier than Americans.. it's primarily due to diet. This book will tell you all about it.  It will change your eating habits and lifestyle for the better.
B000E1NWJQ|3.0|Nice music and nice 3D sound but some microphone hiss at very high volume. It ould be good if more current recordings from 2009 were available for SACD rather than music that was rrecorded in the 70s and remastered. Still worth the purchase.
B001ACH4DS|4.0|I'm not inclined to make a quick judgement on any new music by an artist I like, so I've waited until after I saw David Cook in concert (last Saturday). As far as the recording in general - I wasn't disappointed, it's a very good, solid mainstream recording, and that is the genre to which it should be compared. With many, if not most of his fans being from his exposure on Idol, I knew that this was not likely to be wildly experimental (which is the usual direction in which my tastes run). This guy is smart - get mentoring from some of the most successful contemporary songwriters and producers, establish and satisfy a wide fan base, and appeal to possibly the most unique demographic of any current performer. It's not an alternative rocker selling out - it's someone establishing a solid base to take off from.  The concert absolutely confirmed that and why I was willing to support this guy from the beginning.  What seems to be happening is that he and the band are subtly tweaking the songs toward a less mainstream, more alternative sound. By way of example: while performing the last chorus of \\"Lie\\" (which I think of as probably the most mainstream song on the CD - pretty melody and orchestration, bittersweet, romantic, etc...), he stood back about 4 feet from the microphone and sang acapella, his voice clear, but distant. It was such a simple change to make, yet it conveyed, in an astoundingly effective way, the heartwrenching pain of loss, the exact feeling of powerlessness in being left behind, as well as a sound that was riveting. Being able to experiment with these songs, altering the sound, deepening the meaning, shows his strength as a performer and artist.   With more freedom from his producers, I think he'll stretch way beyond the mainstream sound of this recording, yet still remain accessible. It may be a slow process, but I'm looking forward to it.

B0000DJE9R|4.0|This cd is full of the King of Pop's greatest hits except one song that I thought that didn't belong there which is Break of Dawn which isn't t hat great of a Michael Jackson hit whatever album it came from. If you are not that into Michael Jackson music then you should buy this album. May his music live on

B001OQCVA6|5.0|I found myself tearful, for the life she had and the one I thought I had. I moved to the Bay Area in 1966 as a new bride. Julia Child was brand new to me and I was smitten. I learned to cook well, attending La Varenne in Paris, and learned to laugh at my mistakes (I also learned that a glass of wine couldn't hurt). I'm so glad she had her dream man and I'm not a bit jealous. I love Meryl Streep and think she captured Julia like no one else could. I buy very few DVDs (Disney for my grandkids, a rare documentary for me), but signed up for this one. I loved it.

1932100660|5.0|The nay-sayers leaving bad reviews are confirming what the book said would happen. A high meat and animal product diet is the American/Western way, and when you challenge the status quo, no matter how much evidence you have, you will be ridiculed! People don't like change, especially when it comes to making a daily change. You need to leave your personal bias at the front door before you begin to read this book.    Before I read this book I was what most people would consider a \\"healthy\\" person at a \\"healthy\\" weight. However, Being 6'1'' and 205lbs., my BMI was at 27 and my diet was probably 80% animal products. I would have some kind of meat at every meal, and I drank a gallon of milk every three to four days. After reading this book, I quit drinking milk \\"cold turkey\\". I have drastically reduced my animal product intake to probably around 15% of my diet. With my exercise levels staying the same, I have lost 12lbs. in about four months. BUT, the best part is that I feel so much better! I have more energy than I have had in the longest time! If you are skeptical of this book, it's going to be hard to argue against real life results such as myself! There are other posters on here that have had much more drastic results too!    With that being said, I do feel he may have gotten ahead of himself by advocating a vegan diet. I think he even says at one point that the evidence only points to a low intake of animal products of no more than 10% of your diet. Other than that, the sources that I have looked into have all checked out.    Also, people need to keep in mind that just because something is linked to a certain disease doesn't mean that you will always get that disease! Look at smoking. There is overwhelming evidence that smoking \\"causes\\" lung cancer. But guess what? Everyone that smokes does NOT get lung cancer! People live \\"long\\" lives all the time that had been smokers their entire adults lives. They never get lung cancer and die of other causes. Should we say that smoking doesn't cause cancer just because these smokers never got it? No way! When it comes to human health, there is never a \\"for sure\\" thing out there that will or will not cause a disease. The human body is much too complicated to make any guarantee.    To argue against eating more fruits and veggies to help improve your health (like some posters on here have been) is just asinine.  I will take my chances with what \\"The China Study\\" recommends for diet. It has worked for me so far, and guess what? IT JUST MAKES SENSE!
B001DMJ9R4|1.0|I don't care how gorgeous the set props are, or how energetic the band are live, or how awesome the 5.1 mix is, or how sharp the band look onstage, or how crazy the fans are...<br /><br />...I hate quick editing.<br /><br />To Ben \\"Pizza Enthusiasist\\": Did you and I watch the same DVD? You mentioned that the editing was perfect... it certainly wasn't in what I watched. I love Avenged Sevenfold, but honestly, the editing hurts my soul.<br /><br />Now of course AUDIABLY it's great, the band are very good live. I did't see them when they came to E-town, unfortunately, but I will catch them next time. THat said though, I can't stand to watch this DVD because of how quickly edited it is.<br /><br />3 minutes into Critical Acclaim and I already have a headache. Come Afterlife, I just can't stand to watch anymore. So that said I turned it off and just popped in the B-Sides CD insead.<br /><br />I did LISTEN to the concert, I turned off the TV and listened through my 5.1 speakers, and it's great. I really liked it alot. As for the B-sides, I think they're GREAT! I love Demons, Dancing Dead, Tension, as well as the cover of Flash of the Blade by my favorite band Iron Maiden. And the two alternate versions are great too.<br /><br />I just hate it when Crack-addled editors edit a video at about 5 camera angles per second. People said Maiden's videos suffered from this, but no actually, I didn't notice it.<br /><br />I guess I'll just wait until the next DVD comes out and hopefully it has good editing. As well as I got hand-filmed footage on YouTube I could always watch.
0752815423|5.0|Harry Bosch's third series book, THE CONCRETE BLONDE, is the best of the growing series.  Reading the first two books (THE BLACK ECHO and THE BLACK ICE) allows this book to take a form that builds to a shocking ending.  No doubt that Michael Connelly was very creative in this book if you knew his background in utilizing characters.<br /><br />Excellent read to make readers want to get right into book #4.
B000JML7EC|5.0|I've actually never read this before, but since I could get it for free on my Kindle, I thought it was worth a try.  So right!  It deserves its reputation.  A swashbuckling tale of intrigue and fun.  Truly worth the time it took to read it.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|Fantastic CD that really shows why Michael Jackson is the King of Pop - this CD is a must for Michael Jackson fans
B001W63DX2|5.0|This DVD is great!!!!  For those who live the great experience to assist one of this concerts (in San José, Costa Rica) and for those who couldn't (sorry!!!!) this dvd give us the enormity of Iron Maiden and the power and energy of his performance in the scenario.  I recommend it for the Iron Maiden's followers!!!!! It's a must in your collection.
B00005QGAV|5.0|This is a great CD. Love all the songs on it.  Wish I could find a CD with his song Butterflies besides Invinceable.
B000VBP382|5.0|Do not understand why there are 2 disc's, they are the same movie,exactly! But for the price it is packaged nicely.
B002DPCTZE|1.0|HORRIBLE movie!! I expected a fun superhero movie but there was just TOO MUCH violence and the storyline was DULL, DULL, DULL. Obviously I have never read this comic and do not intend to read it.  Wish I had those 3 hours and $4 back.  AWFUL!!
045122499X|5.0|Another masterpiece from Ken Follett.  After 1000 pages my only regrett was that their were not 1000 more.  He brought 14th centurn England and the plight of the inhabitants to life.  I hated to put it down.  Extremely well told.
B001N44BVQ|2.0|The sort of movie you have to be in the mood for when you watch it.  I kept thinking Ive seen it all before with the movie being twisted and twisted in an obvious effort to disguise the fact that the movie is based on the same old boring plot we've all seen before. Even the addition of top actors and a big budget couldn't save it from flopping.  I felt a general lack of interest in what was going on throughout the movie but every now and then a LOUD in my face action sequence was thrown in just to shake me out of my daze. During the movie I ended up wanting Roger Ferris (DiCaprio) to Die, and for the movie to climatically end. To sum it up I found the Plot boring and a waste of two precious hours.
067101756X|2.0|I remember reading this some years ago and it seemed strange that one army officer could have access to so many high levels of government and business. What are the odds that one person could be involved, directly or indirectly, in particle beam weapons, microwaves, fiber optics and so on? He said he knew where the bodies were buried, literally, but did not give any details. I thought that it was entertaining but improbable.
1582701709|5.0|Great motivational book, try it before you buy it! I picked this one up at my local library and after giving it a decent effort to use the technique in the book \\" affirmation \\" i started to realize that it was working. I checked my local 2 major bookstores and i was beginning to feel like it was greatly overpriced but after checking amazon it was about 70% cheaper. I promise if you buy this book, you will not regret it. It is definately home library material. Its a short book detailed book, Enjoy!
B0019LY5I2|5.0|There's only one scene of gruesome violence. The actors have decent chemistry. The sets are imaginative. The story is entertaining enough. I would even call GI Joe more science fiction then anything else. This is a fun B-movie, something safe enough for even older children to enjoy.<br /><br />Sure, GI Joe gets most of it's ideas from much better movies like the Matrix, X-Men and the Manchurian Candidate. So I realize it would be easy to tear a film like GI Joe to pieces! But the story made me laugh, at times, for being so preposterous, and it was entertaining without going overboard. What's more New York City gets a reprieve, for a change, and was not attacked by the terrorists! What more could you ask for from this kind of movie?
B000AMUU94|4.0|If you are not familar with David Bowie and I can't see why you would not be this is good place to start. I simply love everything Bowie has ever done so I'm a bit biased but anyway, buy this cd and get caught up to speed with what David Bowie is in the music world. You won't regret it, I promise. Then go buy his other stuff and enjoy what real music is.
B000021XS0|5.0|A few years ago I reviewed this amazing album but now I see my review was deleted so I decided to put another one because simply Scenes is what Progressive music should be about.    I remember when I first listen to this album I was shocked, I couldn't believe that it was possible to release and album as great and perfect as Scenes from a Memory and obviously if any band can do that well that band is Dream Theater.    This album in my opinion is the turning point on DT's career, because they decide to include Jordan Rudess in the line up and with that they just did the move they required to be an even better band; after the dark years they had with Falling into infinity and everything that surround those years, they just came into the new millennium with this masterpiece and regain the all the fans that were literally stumped by the previous release.    I have to be fair, when this album was released and maybe for 5 years I really believe Scenes was the only album that can be as great as Images and words, but as you might know DT has released Octavarium and Systematic Chaos, two albums that in my opinion are as great as Images and Scenes, so at this point it is very difficult to review this album, but I must say that Scenes is what I think the album that changes Dream Theater to a far better band I think that they become better with every album they released but everything started with Scenes from a Memory and I must say I really loved DT before Scenes but once this album was released I become even more interested in everything any member of DT got involved, I loved this band even more since this album and actually thanks to this album I got involved in progressive rock and discover fantastic bands as Symphony X, Pains of Salvation, Threshold, Royal Hunt, among others    Scenes is a real masterpiece, is brutally heavy and amazingly melodic and in my opinion it has one of the most powerful ballads DT has ever released The Spirit carries on, I love this song well I really loved this album, it is great in every way and has everything DT is about.    You may like it or not, but at the end this is an album that gets bigger through years and for the fans and maybe the Band this is the album that really launch them and put them as what they are today the GODS OF PROGRESSIVE ROCK¡¡¡
B000001EL3|5.0|Top notch cd. Starting off with Detroit Rock City which to this day is a staple in their live set to the apparent question to the fans Do You Love Me. KISS made their classic cd after coming off their very successful KISS Alive. Great sound from the band. It's very easy for people today to try to write KISS off for them marketing themselves they way they do now. I for one don't fault them one bit. Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley are the best businessmen in the music world. I've been a fan since I was a kid and still am to this day. I sometimes wonder what bands today would not even be here if it was not for KISS. You wanted the best, you got the best. KISS!!!
B00005UEAR|5.0|I just realize it takes me almost 7 years to make a review about this phenomenal album by Dream Theater, and it wasn't because I didn't want to but I just feel this albums Six Degrees was one step behind other DT albums (except Falling into infinity which is my least favorite), but even though I always liked this album I never felt its greatness until this weekend when I took my Ipod an decide to listen the Portnoy's saga in its entirety, starting with The Glass Prison and concluding with The Shattered Fortress (included on DT's new album Black Clouds & Silver Linings) and man something really grabs me there and I am not going to get immerse on describing all these five songs that compose the saga and how incredible it is to listen all of them continuously (it will be great to have a live set of this 5 songs¡¡¡ hopefully soon DT will give us this chance)    The thing was that this weekend  I just loved the sound of The Glass Prison I think it is a perfect song to start Portnoy's saga, so once I finished this idea I decide to give a new try to the hole 1st cd and maybe thats were the problem was because I always thought that the 1st CD wasn't as good as the 2nd therefore I always listen only to this one, so this time I did the opposite and man I still don't know what happen but I just loved, really loved this 1st CD and now I must say that I was so wrong considering Six Degrees an album not as great as Scenes, Images, ToT or Systematic indeed it is an excellent album just in the same category of all DT albums (again with the exception of Falling into infinity which even though I really like it I still believe there is something missing)     So Six Degrees is an outstanding album not as heavy as ToT but very close in some parts¡¡ this album as always with Dream Theater has everything you want, heaviness, dark passages, excellent riffs, sad and slow moments, epic and very prog moments. It is simply a perfect blend of what DT is about and that is the only reason you need to go and buy this album and if you already got it then plug your headphones and enjoy it again.    At this very moment I must say that the five songs on the 1st CD are fantastic but if I must pick then I would say that my favorites will be The Great Debate, The Glass Prison, Misunderstood & Disappear (a song that has all the emotion you require for a very sad and lonely moment, incredible to listen all by yourself), which are slightly ahead to Blind Faith (a song that sometimes I really loved and sometimes not that much)     The 2nd CD (8 \\"short\\" songs that totally length over 40 minutes) is simply mind blowing whether you listen to it on its entirety or only a few songs it is just perfect¡¡ what a masterpiece they create here, the Finale is amazing and in concert this part just gives me the Goosebumps...    It is incredible to listen how diverse DT can be not just from one album to the other but in the same album, now I understand the title of this album its just the perfect turbulence you want to feel when you listen a DT album.    So now 7 years from its release I am so thrilled as if this album has just been released today, I have discovered a lot of new things in this album and it really worth the time to really understand the album, the songs are great, the mix, the production everything is amazing, and again the band sound so tight so perfect¡¡, and the best part is that this songs sound even better LIVE¡¡    DT is the best band in the world and for me the best Band that ever existed... by FAR¡¡¡
0792839730|5.0|'A Bridge Too Far' is truly epic. It is really one of the last sprawling epics about World War II before 'Saving Private Ryan' which had a more intimate story. I really like how historically accurate 'A Bridge Too Far' tries to be and it is really great to see all of the legendary actors at work. Edward Fox is one of the standouts as Horrocks and he brings a real character to life. Sean Connery is also very good as Urquhart. Anthony Hopkins is quite good as John Frost. Robert Redford gets to star in the most stirring scene for American viewers that depicts the assault in rubber boats across the Waal river by the 82nd Airborne. The courage displayed in the assault was truly legendary. The film really does a good job in depicting this crucial segment of the battle. Also the suicidal SS armored vehicle assault at the bridge at Arnhem is well depicted and shows how tough the British paratroopers were and the true arrogance that the Germans displayed numerous times during the war.     Only wish that a DVD version could come out that was truly cleaned up and remastered. The movie deserves better picture and sound on DVD.    The film has good acting, great actors, and very good battle scenes. Highly recommended to all movie and military history buffs!
B001ECQ75A|4.0|Perfect well-animated flick for the youngsters.  Great choice to have a laugh, enjoy the great voice cast and well written story of a sweet panda destined for greatness.<br /><br />Set in old China it has beautiful artwork as part of the appeal.  The story is great, flows well and the characters are exquisitely funny and bright.
B00003CXA6|5.0|What really can be added about this famous movie? I guess not much but I will leave some of my humble comments. I like this movie very much. I have watched it many times. I know it has flaws. I still like it very much. The acting by the main actors is very good, very good indeed (to paraphrase Lee from the film). Jeff Daniels is great as Joshua Chamberlain. He brings the man back to life in so many different ways and he is a dead ringer for the real Chamberlain. I really like the other actors too, especially Tom Berenger. Berenger makes a truly great Longstreet and makes him very human and moving. The character was one of my favorites in the novel and I think Berenger does him justice. Richard Jordan is great as Armistead and Stephen Lang IS Pickett. Sam Elliott makes for a wonderful John Buford he really embodies the old Indian fighter and a man who is down to his last battle. Over the years I have come to respect Martin Sheen's depiction of Lee and he is in one my favorite scenes in the movie. This movie tries very hard to be great and I think that it comes close. I have watched it too many times to be completely unbiased but I still think that for all people that it is a worthwhile movie. The battle scenes of the 20th Maine on Little Round Top and Pickett's Charge are very good and moving. The opening credits are great and the music enhances the film.    Maybe one day a longer cut of the film will be released on DVD. When the film was shown on TNT lately it had numerous deleted scenes. It is too bad these are not viewable on the DVD in some way. The picture and sound quality on the DVD are quite good. Maybe a super deluxe edition of the movie will be released on DVD around 2013 since that is the 150th anniversary of the battle.     'The Killer Angels' was great source material and I think that 'Gettysburg' did justice to it. I wish more quality Civil War films were made. Highly recommended!
B000022TSY|4.0|Travelling through scenic US is a classic way American movies run frequently ([[ASIN:B000K7VHQE Little Miss Sunshine]], [[ASIN:B00003CXIY Road Trip (Unrated Edition)]] etc) .<br />Two friends look around to meet new people, to exercise freedom and to know native country better to a dramatic extent.<br /><br />Rather funny and scandalous than sexy and unpredictable to a contemporary viewer movie is a nice musical and historical low budget work with recently convinced Spector playing a bad boy in.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I would never have thought of Paul Giamatti as John Adams, but he pulls it off in excellent style!     Adams has been one of my favorite founding fathers for a long while. He has been very lucky that many wonderful books have been written about him beside the famous McCullough one. I think of two in particular- Page Smith's two volume set and John Ferling's bio. I also liked the portrayal of him in the movie '1776' by William Daniels.    This brings me back to Giamatti. He really made the role his own and got better and better as the series went along. By the time he reached the presidency he WAS John Adams. Giamatti has many great scenes and he really pulls out all the stops. His speech for the Declaration of Independence is grand and there are many wonderful scenes such as meeting King George III and his speech in the church in Episode I. I also like the use of 'Hail Columbia' in Episode 6. That scene alone is worth something in and of itself. Also a note about the wonderful credits that bring the old battle flags back to life. 'Don't tread on me' and 'Appeal to Heaven' are just two great old slogans in the flags. The opening credits are really stirring.    Laura Linney pretty much matches Giamatti scene for scene. Abigail is also a favorite historical character of mine. I wrote a paper on Abigail in college and find her truly fascinating. Linney does a really great acting job and brings Abigail back to life. Also, Tom Wilkinson as Ben Franklin and Stephen Dillane as Thomas Jefferson are worthy of high praise. David Morse as George Washington is very good also but I liked the depiction of Washington by Jeff Daniels in 'The Crossing' a little better.    I have only a few quibbles: there are some 'dutch angles' that were really not needed. The camerawork should just have been straight forward. Also, some of the historical facts are changed around for some reason. The real history is just as fascinating and should have been left alone. In this regard I think of the famous correspondence between Adams and Jefferson as being depicted as starting in 1818 after the death of Abigail instead of the actual time of 1812. In real life Abigail wrote some letters to Jefferson during this time. There are a few more factual changings but on the whole they don't detract that much from the miniseries. In the end I'm just thankful something like this was even made.    Also, the closing scene of the miniseries will stay with you a long time and the wonderful quote by Adams that ends the miniseries really is a great finale.    Highly recommended!

B000AOEMXM|5.0|THE PRODUCT IS VERY GOOD, BE ADVISED THAT THE REGION CODE MAY NOT WORK FOR EVERY DVD PLAYER!  THE SERVICE WITH AMAZON WAS RELIABLE, LEAVING ME SATISFIED!
B001QTXM5Y|1.0|My title might not be completely fair, it is contending for that slot with Krull the Conqueror and Dungeons & Dragons.    However for the budget it really should have been better.  [...]    However this movie forgot to put, for the lack of a better term, point into the story.    The director claims to have been a big fan of the work, but I don't think he actually understood it.  This is shown just as much in the unneeded changes (why did Dan go to alert Voit? Why was the scene with Dr Manhatton, Lori and Rorschach changed?) as it is by the focus on the horrible action sequences.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|Mj was a true Indigo, Indigo's are here \\"to heal the world\\" has been propagated in recent years by well-known healers and spiritualists. Watching a full concert, I never had the priviledge to see him live, is amazing. This is fantastic footage, he is a phenominal performer, the best ever, and I think very few in the world can hold a candle up to his performances. No one can be compared, and this will truely show our children and grand children what an amazing entertainer MJ was.<br />From crying on stage every time he performs that song, is so REAL, there is no acting. I read comments of Quincy Jones that everytime MJ sing's that song, he cries for real, and he (QJ) has never come accross a singer that can put ALL that emotion into his music, so people, so you know, his crying is no ACT!!!! Enjoy this, I hope they will do DVD's of all his world tours......all 3......and AEG is putting out end of OCT the last tour practices (This is it) Can't wait.<br />We truely will miss MJ, spread his love to all!
0679746323|1.0|Don't be surprised that there are people who actually bought the book and liked it. After all, people here voted G.W. Bush into white house twice, and approved invation of Iraq 6 years ago.
B00005QGAX|5.0|great album. We all are buyning MJ's collection again. He will go down in history. So talented and so misunderstood. MJ was a true Indigo (google it) his talents were out of this \\"world\\" we all know that. Great collections of songs, we know most of these songs.!!!
B001FB55H6|1.0|This movie can be summed up in one word.... SUCKED!  The story line was pointless and the movie was just so dang boring! Way too many characters and story lines at one time really got me confused!  I am glad I did not waste my time and blow $[...] to go see this crap in the theater.  Thanks to REDBOX, I dont feel too bad about spending a [...] to rent it.  But to own this movie is just a WASTE OF TIME!!!
B0000DJE9R|5.0|Great collection of Michael's top hits. I love MJ, now that he is gone, I suddenly find myself buying all his music again, I had most of it on records, accepte Thriller I bought the CD way back then. This is such a great collection, and I have not stopped since he has passed to play this in my car.<br />Listening to all his music all over again, is like discovering MJ all over, I grew up and is the same age as what he would have been, so I was familiar with his talents.<br /><br />He was so misunderstood, I personaly always knew of his innosence, I could feel it in his music that he was here way before his time. The US was not ready for him, he made a difference we all know that and he will go down in the history for changing the music industry.<br />Glad Amazon is putting all of his music out again.<br />They need to also re-print his Bio  'Moonwalk\\" so we can all buy it.<br />Blessing and love to all!
B000MG1ZG0|3.0|I am a music lover and performer and I collect CDs and thought it would be cool to have Morrison hotel with 8 new tracks.  Little did I know it only had 3. One track I have already.  I have an early copy of Morrison hotel CD with out the extra tracks, as well as this one.  It's interesting to listen to all of the new stuff, on this CD, but it's not the original many of us grew up with.  I will give that the music sounds fuller on my surround sound stereo.  But the vocal on the first song (road house) has a horrible echo and it is very odd.  I thought it was my stereo, so I turned off the surround sound on it, and the vocal was still over affected and sounded horrible.  The rest of the CD sounds really good but as for growing up on this stuff it kind of ruins it.  The remastering on this copy gives it a cool spin on this old gem, but leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  In short; Road House, Land Ho have over affected and corny vocals.  Indian summer and queen of the highway sound awesome almost better. Then there are the extra tracks, these are out takes and mess-ups.  These are cool to hear how they recorded road house, but almost too much road house. The others sound really cool, they add to the value.   I'll keep this one for the nostalgia.  The booklet has awesome facts witch adds to the value, and this is why I give it 3 out of 5.       This new trend of adding things to classic albums, like this, really treads on a fine line.  When they add to the songs some times they make it a bit sappy.  The Read Hot Chilly Peppers Mothers Milk is one they ruined badly!  It was ruined by adding the extra parts; it made the album sappy, and made me uneasy.  I don't know what it is with this new trend of adding new things to some of these old classics, it's a shame. some times it's cool to add a spin to a old song we hear 1,000 times, but when they start adding some of this new stuff like the techno beat added to the Who song I heard on TV.  It left a bad taste again.  I understand it's cool to update these songs and making them modern and its cool making remixes, but I hope these songs don't become the norm.
B00005R2IS|3.0|\\"Mad Max\\" is one of those films that is on everyone's top film lists. Not only did it introduce us to Australian cinema, but also a young 21-year old newbie named Mel Gibson. \\"Mad Max\\" was dark, it was brooding, it was destructive, and it never gave us that glimmer of hope for humanity, but now - nearly 20 years later - does it still remain the classic that it started? Sure, it was impressive to watch the crash scenes, it was powerful to see the world through Mr. Miller's disturbed eyes, but is it re-watchable? Does it have the appeal to see new things throughout if watched and watched again? For me, the answer seemed to float near \\"no\\". While I loved what \\"Mad Max\\" represented, what it was - a full body of color and action - it wasn't something to be watched again and again. Gibson does a great job as Max, a man torn between the evils of the road and his personal philosophies. He begins as an ominous optimist, able to stop crime as it occurs on the streets, but then as his sense of normality is turned upside down, his ability to react and adapt is seen. The final moments, he has transformed from the man we were first introduced to into something quite terrifying. One could also compliment Mr. Miller's directorial outing, at times it felt a bit episodic with tough edits placed, but for the majority he told a deathly story with great ease and excitement. So, again, there is no arguing that \\"Mad Max\\" is an important film, one that I am glad to have finally seen, but once was enough. It seems to be lacking that re-watch excitement.<br /><br />But why has that conclusion been made? What makes \\"Mad Max\\" mediocre instead of powerful? It is hard to pinpoint the exact scene, but the sense of \\"alright, I've seen it - now what\\" was definitely present by the end. Yet, there were points that I just loved. Gibson was perfect. He was incredible as Max, and the world that Mr. Miller created was intense. The opening scene, the car crashes as our bearded villain just yelled \\"Toecutter\\" was fantastic. \\"Mad Max\\" has one of those openings that just pulls you in, that makes you excited to watch a film of this intensity, but then where do you go? Miller seemed to indicate that more car crashes, more violence, more cliche family drama would indicate a stronger film. At times he was right, his ability to create different scenes set across the same backdrop demonstrated his originality, but then there were times where it just felt recycled. One scene that stands out, is where our gang of bikers track down a couple that happens to be at the wrong place at the wrong time, they chase them down and demoralize them as Max and his partner find them - then, almost repetitively, it happens with Max and his girl later in the film. In this post-apocalyptic world, there seems to be no problem finding someone. Space seems to not be a problem. This was another unexplained moment - where the coincidence of discovering Max or finding the biker gang should have been more difficult. These repetitive, essentially simplistic scenes seemed to detract from the power of what Max represented. One also needs to ask about the story, the unknown of what time or place we are following Max - would this have strengthened the story knowing what world we lived in? The understanding that this was a low-budget film was rooted in my mind, the techniques provided were impressive, but should that have been neglected for mediocre storytelling? Perhaps I misread this film, perhaps I missed the joy of why this is hailed as such a cult success.<br /><br />Another weakness against \\"Mad Max\\" has to be the relationship between his wife/girlfriend and child. Again, the lacking story helped confuse this viewer as to what dynamic they had, but when we have scenes in which the child is completely forgotten about - it just decimates the reasons behind Max's anger and utter breakdown. There were several scenes in which I yelled at the screen, \\"What about the child\\", then finally they would remember- he seemed to fade in and out of existence too often for one film. Then, when disaster strikes, we are forced to believe that suddenly Gibson would release his inner rage? It just didn't work. The same can be said for his wife/girlfriend. A stronger definition of character, and even more lines spoken would have helped me see the relationship. She seemed angry at first, the product of a failed marriage forced by this post-apocalyptic world to stay together, then we were introduced to love, then suddenly, she moved to idiocrity. Who would believe that running down a road, when there are open fields around, is the better option? It was these small inconsistencies that forced \\"Mad Max\\" from greatness to just another average action film. Two-plus hour sweeping epics aren't always needed, but stronger characters do help in creating the world that we, as viewers, are to inhabit for 90-ish minutes.<br /><br />Finally, applause are in order for the villain in this film. The portrayal of Toecutter by Hugh Keays-Byrne was outstanding. The small attention to detail as well as his ability to make you feel like he would do anything to get his way - similar to the portrayal of Joker in \\"The Dark Knight\\" - was an up moment for this film. Like a roller coaster, \\"Mad Max\\" had these ups and downs, curves and jerks, and when it was all said and done, you really had to question whether you were going to ride it again. \\"Mad Max\\" is an important film, there is no question in my mind about that. The door that this film opened for future cinema in America couldn't have been done by a better group of filmmakers, but it isn't a promising classic. I could not watch this film again. The sequels I am ready for, but this ride is over - and the park is closing. I realize that I am in the minority, but \\"Mad Max\\" is a low-budget film that uses repetitive filmmaking as its staple - originality is present, but you must search to find it.<br /><br />Grade: *** 1/2 out of *****fade in and out of existence too often for one film.

B0000VCZK2|5.0|This is truly one or the best box-sets that I've ever seen. It contains 9 DVD discs, 4 of which contain the 4 Alien movies in two versions, the theatrical release and a special edition release that true Alien fans will simply love. These 4 discs come with Audio in Spanish Stereo, English Stereo and English in Dolby Digital 5.1, subtitles in Spanish and English as well and all of them have the Audio Comments by the Directors.     When you watch the special editions of the films you have the possibility of knowing when a scene not included in the theatrical version is being shown, this is done by a special edition marker, definitely a feature rarely seen in other sets. There is a whole DVD disc packed with bonus material for each one of the four films. You get to see documentaries on the score, the special effects, the set making, the casting, they have stills and more. All is narrated by the producers, actors, directors and the people involved in the making of the films.     Besides all this, there is a 9th disc which has the theatrical trailers of all the movies, it contains the scrips and an excellent documentary about all the four films as well. The box completely open is over 1.80 meters long, has an exquisite green design and comes with a little guidance book.    I give 5 stars to this set because it has everything a collector's edition set should have, the Alien Quadrilogy box set is by all means money well spent.
0545123267|4.0|Just finished Maggie Stiefvater's SHIVER, and I can totally understand why people are loving this book.    1) Werewolves don't change under a full moon in Stiefvater's book, and the rationale is about the best I've ever seen. Loves it!    2) You can smell the bookstore, the candy store, the crappy instant coffee Grace makes. Stiefvater has a way of taking you there.    3) I don't read books that wax poetic, and yet this book kept me riveted. Stiefvater has a way with metaphor, but I'm more of who/what/where/give me the steak and potatoes kind of reader. But the short chapters and crazy amount of tension throughout kept me flipping pages when I should've been earning a paycheck.    4) There are a lot of baddies in this book--both of the furred and unfurred variety. Not once did I ever think our young hero and heroine were in a good, safe place. And that's exactly the experience you're looking for as a reader.    5) The love story seems like it will never, ever have a happy ending. Our romantic leads are more star-crossed than Romeo and Juliet, more doomed thanHades and Persephone, more cross-species than Edward and Bella. And that's all I'm going to say.    -The Five Randoms ([...])
B0026NWBY2|5.0|This is an excellent selection of songs that Olivia Arias Harrison, George's widow had a lot of input in choosing.  This collection of George Harrison masterpieces which Giles Martin remastered will no doubt be an asset to any fan's collection.<br /><br />George Harrison was a nonpareil guitarist and his lyrics were of extraordinary caliber.  For many years he had the unique distinction of being the only former Beatle to have a song reach the #1 place on the U.S. charts.<br /><br />The remastering of this fine collection of works makes for a better listening experience.  As a lifetime Beatles' fan and George Harrison fan, I honestly believe the songs sound better than ever on this collection.<br /><br />Even a former Beatle can't dodge his own influence and that is shown here with the inclusion of the 1968 White Album gem, \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps.\\"  You get a live version from the 1971 Concert for Bangladesh.  That benefit concert was the first such known concerts held to raise funds, supplies and general awareness of the plight of East Pakistani refugees.  The concert was in part a nod to sitarist Ravi Shankar, who approached George on what he felt could be done on behalf of the people.  That concert featured a stellar lineup of talent that included Bob Dylan, Billy Preston, Leon Russell, former bandmate Ringo Starr and nonpareil guitarist Eric Clapton.  You really get to enjoy the intense guitar work of the Messrs. Harrison and Clapton.<br /><br />The Concert for Bangladesh would pave the way for benefit concerts in subsequent years, such as Farm Aid and Live Aid.  George Harrison was a musical pioneer in many ways.<br /><br />An interesting aside - George's sister Louise and their father Harold Sr. attended the Concert for Bangladesh.  Harold Sr. was reported to have had some musical ability in that he played some guitar as a young man.<br /><br />The selection of songs range from his Beatles' classic \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" and 1969's \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" to a song released on his last CD, \\"Any Road.\\"  Readers can feel that they are taking the Long & Winding Road that leads them through George's stellar musical career.<br /><br />Each one of the songs on this collection is deep and meaningful.  George's autobiography, \\"I Me Mine,\\" tells the story of the songs he had written up until that point in his life (when the book was released) and hard core fans will no doubt find the music that much more beautiful and poignant.<br /><br />Many of George's songs dealt with spiritual themes, such as \\"What is Life,\\" \\"My Sweet Lord\\" and \\"Rising Sun\\" and \\"Any Road.\\"  Many church groups, including my church (it's a Catholic church) use George's songs for prayer meetings, Bible studies and discussion groups.  For everyone, those who believe in a Higher Power (\\"bow to God and call Him Sir\\") and those whose core values and beliefs do not include a Deity will find solace in many of George's songs.  Regardless of faith expression (\\"any road'll take you there\\"), George's music will remain timeless, inclusive and relevant.<br /><br />For just about any given issue, relevant Harrison lyrics can always be found.<br /><br />I am encouraging people to buy this collection!  This will keep the word out that listeners want and will continue to want more George Harrison recordings.  Let's ALL encourage Capitol/Dark Horse to keep the George Harrison train running.  I like what another U.S. reviewer suggested about having a Part 2 of rarities and other obscure songs that this collection did not include.  How about including a George Harrison booklet WITH any and all future releases of remastered Harrison works?  That will certainly delight fans and those just coming into George's works all the more.<br /><br />Our modified version of TWO Harrisongs:  We Remember George and Thanks For the Music, George!\\"Any Road.\\"  Readers can feel that they are taking the Long & Winding Road that leads them through George's stellar musical career.

0316044695|5.0|This book grabbed my attention from the very first chapter and I could not put it down.  My heart goes out to Marcus and the families of those lost in Operation Redwing.  This book is a must read for anyone who loves the USA.  I have never had a book affect me the way this one has.  I have always been proud to be an American but now I am even more proud of my country and what the brave men and women of the military do for us everyday.  I cried while reading this book and many tears afterwards.  Many of my personal feelings are because I am so disappointed and disgusted in our current administration (2008 - 2012) and the lack of patriotism I see coming from the news media and the Whitehouse.
B001RTP3YQ|2.0|A few months ago, I gave this Cd 2 stars. Now, my review has disappeared. These reviews are a swiz.
B0028K3192|5.0|I have waited in anticipation of this album's release for several months now after I saw on Maxwell's FB page that he would be released this year, and MAN was it worth the wait!!!!  The music is lush and layered, the lyrics are words you can relate to, and well his more adult look is wonderful!! I love the CD and cannot wait until the remaining two of the trilogy are released.  My favorites are \\"Stop the World\\", \\"Bad Habits\\" (saw the video for it this weekend hot!), and \\"Help Somebody\\".  Then there is \\"Fistful of Tears\\" and \\"Possum\\" which are deep and touching in their lyrical content.  Get this CD!
B001DTPZNY|2.0|This movie is not what I expected. It's not like the old masterpieces that Steven Spielberg and George Lucas used to make, that had the action, the comedy, and the epic adventure that everybody liked. This Indiana Jones movie had a good storyline, great soundtrack, and great effects, but excepet that it was a big crap. Indiana Jones didn't show a lot of emotions and fellings that he was liking and living the adventure. I thought that this was going to be a classic, just like the old ones. It got even worst with Shia LaBeouf. He was good on Transformers, but not on Indiana Jones (especialy as their son). It was a very good idea on putting Marion back on the movie with Indy, but it wasn't enough to make the movie like its predecessors. The only good part was the beginning, where the soviets, indy and his partner were at the place where the ark was being kept. It was a very creative scene.      Another thing I didn't like was his relations with his son and his wife, they treated each other like strangers. Also, the ending wasn't that good. Something was messing from this movie that made it so horrible, the adventre's just not the same. Let's hope that if they make a next Indiana Jones film, that it would be better than this one. I mean, it's being 20 yeas since the last Indiana Jones film, but it's not worth it.     The DVD itself is OK.      If you want to buy it, you gotta know that the movie's very different and not as good as the old ones, but anyone may like it. Even though, I don't recommend this product/movie.
031606792X|5.0|Simply the best book series I ever read in my life.      Breaking Dawn was amazing, entertaining, and just truly a wow....    I am in awe, that the series have touched me so.

0670020478|5.0|Ken Robinson delivered what I think is the best TED presentation of all time. So when a client told me he had written a book, I eagerly ordered it from the U.K. and waited for it to arrive. It lived up to my high expectations, and I finished it in two sittings.    Robinson defines \\"the Element\\" as the point where your natural aptitude meets your personal passion. He talks about the essential components of finding your Element: flow, thinking differently, bucking the trend, finding a tribe, finding a mentor, and doing what you love. It's a book about being inspiring, written by an inspirational author.    I've been thinking a lot recently about what it takes to be a thought leader, so this book came along at the right time. Perhaps it's not the right time for you, so maybe it won't have the same impact. That said, whenever I quote from it or refer to it, it seems to resonate with the people who hear me.

0007240198|5.0|I've known about Ben Goldacre - and been a fan of his - through his podcast, Twitter and audio interviews long before I read this book. So I knew what to expect - and I wasn't disappointed.    Goldacre teaches us the skill of critical thinking in medical science, particularly as it's applied (or misapplied) in the U.K. Among his targets are homeopaths, water diviners, anti-vaccination scaremongers, \\"scientists\\" with laboratories in a garden shed, and other quacks.    But this is not just somebody defending big pharma and attacking alternative medicine. No, this is a book about good science, and Goldacre says pharmaceutical companies have also been guilty of sacrificing good science for good profits. He talks about the way these companies - sometimes even unintentionally - skew research results in their favour, sometimes in subtle ways that are almost impossible to detect. The difference, of course, is that this is wrong, unethical and sometimes illegal; whereas with quackery there usually isn't more than a half-hearted attempt to justify their claims with science.    This is a book of solid science, but one that's written in an accessible, engaging and even witty style.

B000P12LWY|1.0|As someone who values plot and dialog over car (or horse) chases and random gore, I really tried to give this series a chance--especially since I'd just finished HBO's amazing series, \\"Rome\\".  But I couldn't get past this show's failure to show much of anything beyond Jonathan Rhys Meyers alternately pouting or staring sultrily at the camera.  I had no objection to the series' deviation from history; I object to its weak storytelling, bad acting, and total lack of imagination!  Poor sets (they only put thought into the clothing), virtually no battles, and the sensibilities of a soap opera make this series vacuous and painfully bad.  The writers of this show have no idea how to create tension and characterization.  Natalie Dormer has a certain, haunting appeal about her, but this show is really better served with the sound off.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|I can't wait for this season to be released on DVD!  I DVR'd the first 9 episodes of season 1 and then after deciding not to watch them at all, deleted the first 7!  What a mistake!

I finished out the season on the edge of my seat, and can't believe that I missed 7 episodes out of carelessness!    My local station has shown episodes 1-4 and then are only showing episodes 9 and 11 before Season 2 Starts!!!!!!    Get these, they are a keeper and you will want to watch over and over again!
0380730405|4.0|\\"Last night I dreamt I went to Manderly again.\\"<br /><br />The beginning of this classic is really the ending, an epilogue as an introduction. The dark mood, the sense of dread that is established in the dream sets the stage for the entire novel.<br /><br />For anyone who may not be familiar with the story, the narrator (who is unnamed) is a young woman who goes from being a companion for an obnoxious wealthy American woman vacationing in Europe to becoming the wife of Maximilian de Winter, an older, wealthy mysterious man whose first wife, Rebecca, died the previous year. The two women couldn't be more polar opposites. While Rebecca was outgoing and gregarious, the new Mrs. de Winter is shy almost to the point of being antisocial. Rebecca commanded attention; new Mrs. de W craves anonymity. Rebecca feared nothing; new Mrs. de W fears everything, including the memory of Rebecca.<br /><br />This is one I wish I could read again for the first time. Knowing the ending as I read it again I missed the real sense of mystery that grabbed me so before, but the writing is close to perfect. I've said it before about some of the classics, but I love the language. It isn't the same as in Jane Eyre or Pride and Prejudice since the setting is 1930s England rather than pre-Victorian, but du Maurier paints images with her words as well or as better than any author I've ever read.<br /><br />There were things about it that, reading it as an adult, didn't affect me when I read it before. As in Jane Eyre, I cringed a little with the idea of a young woman marrying a much older man with such obvious secrets that no one will talk about. I tried to set this problem aside and enjoy the story for what it was, but it wasn't easy. It was a difficult balance between the wonderful writing and a twenty-first century perspective on so obviously a dysfunctional relationship. I think this quote of Maxim from Chapter 16 aptly illustrates his patronizing opinion of his wife as well as the degree to which he prefers her to remain ignorant of his past: \\"A husband is not so very different from a father after all. There is a certain type of knowledge I prefer you not to have. It's better kept under lock and key. So that's that. And now eat up your peaches and don't ask me any more questions, or I shall have to put you in the corner.\\"  I guess if you're a forty-year-old man married to a twenty-year-old girl in the early twentieth century, you can say things like that.<br /><br />***Spoiler Alert*** It also bothered me tremendously that when the narrator finds out her husband shot and killed his first wife her response is to help him cover up his crime. Call me overly sensitive, but how does a woman in any century find this acceptable behavior in a husband? ***Spoiler Alert and Sermon Over***<br /><br />I realize, of course, that this was written in a different time and that it is a mystery, and while the major problem I had with the relationship between Maxim and Wife #2 made me uncomfortable, it is still a classic worth reading. She does achieve a significant amount of maturity by the end of the story...which is in the first chapter...and I was glad to see that. I have sometimes criticized others for judging people in the past by today's standards, so I want to give both Mrs. de W #2 and the author the benefit of the doubt and encourage you to read the story as the thriller it is meant to be. I would also highly recommend Alfred Hitchcock's 1940 movie version with Sir Lawrence Olivier and Joan Fontaine.hich he prefers her to remain ignorant of his past: \\"A husband is not so very different from a father after all.

It may have been an \\"OK movie\\" (if you like sludge scraped out of a Hollywood gutter), but it was an awful movie based on Toriyama's work. When you make an adaptation, the fan base is what you HAVE to appeal to! There are plenty of other movies out there that have an inspirational element to them; this was just like watching a airliner nosedive into a mountain.

I mean there was some cussing in the books...but not like on the show...and yes the sex was there...but no detail...you had to use your imagination.  But I guess that sells.  I still like the show...can't wait for season 3 to start so that I can buy season 2 lol  And I really hope that the show stays on for all the books in the series...which at this time is 9 books...so that means only 7 & half more years...I think they can do that!!! (Since season 2 already started...which should be book 2 \\"Living Dead in Dallas\\".)  And I do hope they stick to the storyline like the did in the 1st season.  Miss Harris...I look forward to many more books in this series...and hope that I see many more seasons on tv also!!![[ASIN:B001FB4W0W True Blood: The Complete First Season (HBO Series)]]
1439138311|3.0|This book came to my attention because it's on the long list for the Booker prize. The first third of the book was very slow. Toibin painstakingly portrays the heroine, so you really feel for her as she makes her way as an Irish immigrant in post WW2 Brooklyn. The last 2/3 of the book was much better. There was more of a story and I really identified with the heroine's emotional roller coaster. This was the first book I've read by Toibin, so I'll have to read some more of his books to decide if I like him as an author.
B000YJ54DU|2.0|Unlike most Jack Reacher novels this one seems to have been written just to make a buck.  The story was boring and the author's anti-Iraq war feelings were expressed by Reacher which was totally out of character.  If Mr. Child writes another Reacher novel I hope he returns to form.

The book was historically interesting as I had never heard of the impact of WWII on the Channel Islands.  the book gives the reader a look into the aftermath of war on these innocents.  The strong willed nature of humans triumphs throughout the book.  While the book has some moments of sadness, overall, you feel uplifted at the end of the book.  A really great summer vacation read.

It really brings a smile to your face and rhythm, and dance to your body.    Michael is the greatest, no doubt!
0316017922|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell describes stories of communities and people whose attributes do not follow social norms (outliers) throughout his book.  Their successes he argues are results of timing and hours of practice.  For example, those who were born during a certain time period (the beginning of the industrial age) were more likely to be wealthy and in order to truely master something, one must spend at least 10,000 hours studying/practicing. Gladwell observes differences in the academic performance of children from rich and poor families.  He states, the rich kid spends more hours learning through various exposures his parents can afford while the poor kid during summer vacation is left at home doing nothing. How can we expect the poor kid to perform at the same level when he has much less hours of learning/practice than the rich kid?      This theme continues through Gladwell's supporting examples/stories in his book.  I would highly recommend this book as it is very addicting once you start reading.  I found myself inspired by it very much so as I went ahead and bought his other title \\"The tipping point\\" which I had just finished reading.  You won't regret this buy, in fact it might be one of those books where the information you learn will change your life and perception in what it takes for you to be successful.

B0019LY5I2|3.0|To complain that a summer blockbuster is derivative is like whining about the sugar in your candy; once you've tried it, you should know what to expect.  Yet \\"G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra\\" contains a significant number of \\"homages\\" even when considering the standards of its genre.<br /><br />In truth, it's not a bad movie.  \\"Rise of Cobra\\" contains a number of gratifying action sequences, and the special effects on the whole are quite good.  It's also fun for the grown man who enjoyed the toys of his youth to watch the story unfold and ask himself, for example, \\"Is that the Baroness?\\"  And every scene involving Storm Shadow and Snake Eyes (old or young) is edge-of-your-seat good stuff.  There is a lot to keep the casual fan involved.<br /><br />The problem is, many scenes trigger deja vu in a distracting way.  Take, for example, a shot of slo-mo backflips over projectile weapons in a narrow city street: \\"Transformers,\\" anyone?  Or consider the targeting of the Eiffel Tower by a terrorist organization.  We saw that in \\"Team America: World Police,\\" a much better movie in more than one way (here's a hint: it never takes itself too seriously).  The accelerator suits certainly made me think of \\"Ironman\\" on more than one occasion.  The trope of the friend who turns on you--because of a woman--seemed copied-and-pasted from \\"The Dark Knight.\\"  And I won't go into the many parallels with the \\"X-Men\\" trilogy, as that might spoil a few plot twists, but this comparison too was inescapable.<br /><br />So I left the theater feeling a little disappointed.  Not because \\"Rise of Cobra\\" was bad, but because I felt I had seen it a time or two before, and recalled it being just a little bit better.

B00003CY6M|1.0|I consider myself an equal opportunity viewer of cinema, I will watch just about anything.  In contrast, I won't watch everything in the movie theater.  Therefore I can remember seeing the trailer for this movie in the theater and thinking \\"This movie looks stupid\\" and \\"money was spent to make this tomfoolery\\"? Then some years later \\"Serendipity\\" was on cable and figured why not give it a shot. I am not the biggest fan of romantic comedies, but every once in awhile there is a diamond in the rough.  This movie was no diamond, but was rough to watch.<br /><br />When watching a movie I try to identify with the main character(s).  I attempt to do this by relating their situations to an experience I might have encountered.  Or if I have some sort of investment in what the character's grapples, goals and/or endeavors are then I want to see where the story will take them.  This movie failed to satisfy either of my identification ruses.<br /><br />The entire concept of this movie is asinine, guy and girl meet.  They share an unexpected evening of \\"serendipity\\".  They are two strangers that bump into each other and manage to share themselves with one and other.  This is done by just speaking to each other and attempting to uncover where the other one is coming from.  There is no sex, or one night stand, just the sweet moonlight, chilly night in New York.  As the night comes to a close, Sara (Kate Beckinsale) gives her phone number to Jonathan (John Cusack) on a piece of paper. The paper flies away in the wind and Jonathan asks if she can give him the number again.  Sara says no and that it is part of serendipity.  She then writes her name and phone number in a book and alludes to if he can find this book, he can contact her.  Jonathan is standing there befuddled while Sara walks away.  Let's play devil's advocate, is it not serendipity that two random people met in New York and felt a connection instantaneously?<br /><br />So now it is like ten years later, or something and both Sara and Jonathan are living different lives. (It is even funnier that Sara became a psychiatrist given the insight she lives her life by.)  In the back of both of their minds they wonder what could have been had that night so many moons ago worked out differently.  There isn't much more to it, a series of pratfalls and mishaps, not to mention that both Sara and Jonathan are engaged to other people but still infatuated with one and other.  These smitten vibes are present despite that fact they only met once all those years ago and don't even know each other's last name. Nevertheless this being a romantic comedy it isn't too difficult to figure out how it would end.  The acting is usually fair for this type of movie and the overall impression was sort of flat.  The introduction to this movie was so acerbic that it really destroyed the rest of the film for me.  The entire premise seems so, I don't know avoidable.<br /><br />I realize not everyone shares my point of view (which is a good thing) but if I met a woman and had a wonderful night. A night that was unexpected, mind you, and we both felt a connection, a conduit that goes much deeper than carnal urges, because true intimacy can be a precious thing.  Then she gives me her phone number only for the wind to blow it away and my request for her number again ends with \\"its serendipity\\", I would say \\"you've got to be kidding me\\" or \\"thanks for ending this relationship before we went any further\\" maybe \\"I have already dated my fair share of borderline woman, I'll pass\\" another retort \\"got to go, TNT has a James Bond marathon on\\".<br /><br />I suppose it is just me, but this movie shows two people who could have been happy and spend multiple years miserable by choice.

B000VNMMQG|1.0|\\"Amazing Grace\\" is not the story about the classic hymn as the ads and title lead you to believe, it instead attempts to tell the story of English abolitionist William Wilberforce. Wilberforce's struggle to dismantle the horrific slave trade in Britain is a story worthy of a film, but unfortunately \\"Amazing Grace\\" plays more like a crawling, unfocused costume drama that comes across more as a bad TV movie than a serious motion picture. It also unsuccessfully juggles multiple story arcs, creating a fractured narrative that makes the film lose any real power or punch. There are good scenes in this movie, and some decent production values, but it never fully engages the viewer. The film also makes the mistake of forgetting a crucial element of the story: The slaves.     The movie begins with a fascinating scene where Wilberforce shows his compassion for all of God's creatures by stopping a man on a side of the road who whips a black horse, the narrative then jumps to some of Wilberforce's colleagues trying to make a love connection between Wilberforce and a pretty English girl who has followed his abolotinist work for years. It is here where the jumping back and fourth begins as the film decides not to keep a focused narrative and instead employ a flashback technique where the resolutions of certain story arcs are revealed before they even begin. We meet some interesting characters, including a former slave ship captain who wrote the hymn \\"Amazing Grace\\" and is haunted by the memories of his former trade. He gets the best dialogue in the movie, and you wonder, indeed, why the movie isn't about him.     Director Michael Apted, best known for the 007 film \\"The World Is Not Enough,\\" surprisingly exchanges power and impact for cheesy romance and cornball scenes between friends. Like the films \\"Luther\\" and \\"Alexander,\\" Apted here shows a lot but tells too little. There are some good, intense scenes where the British MPs debate the issue of slavery and the economic importance it held at the time, but the very issue of slavery itself feels pushed back in a film which decides to be timid and safe about the subject. Wilberforce tours a slave ship, and we see a few chains on the roof, but we never meet the slaves, we never actually see their plight as in Steven Spielberg's \\"Amistad.\\" There is only one major black character in the film, and he's only given a few lines in two scenes and then we simply discover he died after publishing his memoirs. After that, the African slaves Wilmberforce is fighting for have no identity, they are, as with the former captain, ghosts.     The character of Wilmberforce is also never treated like a flesh and blood person, a brilliant man pushing against the status quo. Oh there are classic moments of fist clenching and shouting, but Wilmberforce is reduced to a cardboard character, a cartoon who only says what we expect him to say. Even his faith, a major theme in a film obviously meant to cater to Christian audiences (Chris Tomlin even sings the title song), is never explored or even convincingly portrayed. How Wilmberforce really find God? We never know, it's all summed up in one corny scene where he sits in a field looking at the sky and observes the beauty of a spider-web, after that the rest of the movie reduced the importance of Wilmberforce's faith to just a few, typical lines like \\"we are all equal in the eyes of God.\\" Can't disagree with the notion, but we're never convinced of the passion or fever of this man's beliefs. Instead of exploring where Wilmberforce's faith comes from, the script feels as if it just had to randomly throw in the word \\"God\\" in every few lines just to remind viewers this is a religious-friendly movie. But those seriously interested in Christian ideas in the fight against slavery will find nothing deep or profound. Valuable space is given to a very unconvincing love story between Wilmberforce and the woman he eventually marries. Their dialogue is suitable for a bad soap operaand we never feel as if these are actually two connected people bound together by anything. Even the films villains have little to no identity, they are simply qeued for every Parliament scene and then disappear in the background.    We shouldn't expect movies to be historical guides, those who really want to inform themselves should go to the local public library instead, but the best historical films also take history seriously and with at least some detail. \\"Amazing Grace\\" simply skips around themes and events without showing their impact or importance. The American Revolution is mentioned and glorified (of course), but it never goes beyond that. Did Wilmberforce have any opinions on America's own slave culture? The Haitian Revolution is at least mentioned in one quick line, but you never know what Wilmberforce thought about it. Thomas Jefferson himself was terrified of the Haitian Revolution because it symbolized the ability of the slaves to rebel and even take power, Jefferson is only mentioned in passing in the film as suspected of corresponding with Wilmberforce eventhough they had completely different ideas of freedom for the slaves. The ending of the film is also a little tricky, I understand Apted has to give the audience what they want, a heroic, triumphant ending for the hero, but the way slavery is abolished is explained in a rapid, muddled narrative. Of course the screenwriters had to find a way around the fact that Britain abolished slavery more for the purpose of hitting the French and American economies hard, not because Wilmberforce convinced the government of his moral battle.     In the end \\"Amazing Grace\\" is a bad exercise in anglophile cinema, this is the kind of movie directors like Spike Lee and actors like Danny Globver must feel frustrated about. Glover himself has been trying to launch a film on the Haitian Revolution for years, but whenever he pitches the script around Hollywood, the answer according to him, is always the same: \\"Where arethe white characters?\\" That is not to say \\"Amazing Grace\\" is some sort of racist film, it has too much of a good heart for that, but in trying to reduce Wilmberforce's struggle to a soapy message movie, the film loses sight of its subject and even its spiritual content. Even the title is not done justice, because the real story of \\"Amazing Grace\\" is surely a film worth making. This one has costumes, but no soul.

B000K7VHQE|5.0|It's hard to say what makes me love Little Miss Sunshine so much. It could be the incredible way they draw humor out of stressful situations and family dysfunction. It could be the wonderful score, largely adaptations from DeVotchKa's amazing album, [[ASIN:B0002Y4SVG How It Ends]]. It could be the insightful cinematography that manages to capture the serene beauty of highway interchanges and oil drills and other unnatural things we usually view as ugly. Mostly, though, it's because it manages, despite its fundamentally depressing plot, to be a feel good movie about people realizing that we can't make ourselves happy; that, instead, we need to let ourselves be happy.

B00005JLEU|5.0|Spirited Away isn't the greatest movie of all time. That said, its shortcomings (namely the somewhat disjointed plot and abrupt transformation of the protagonist's personality) are inherent to most Miyazaki films and to fairy-tales in general. This doesn't concern many of us simply because Spirited Away isn't a movie about its story. It's a movie about a young girl's experiences in a magical world and how they teach her the courage necessary to live a fulfilling life. Even if you don't appreciate that, Spirited Away is more than worth watching for the gorgeous animation and the brilliant soundtrack (possibly my favorite film score ever), which are therapeutic to me in a way that little else is. One final note, I mildly recommend watching this movie subtitled. The dub, while far from terrible, isn't quite up to the quality of Howl's Moving Castle or other Disney releases of Studio Ghibli films. Mostly, though, I make this suggestion because some of the translated dialog also simply reads better than it speaks.
1582701709|5.0|I'm sure this book will (or has) drawn criticism, but I figure anything that gives us motivation to take the high road for ourselves and those around us, is a good thing.  I like the way the book isn't just the author explaining their point of view, but rather a collection of various voices (many famous folks like Churchhill, Lincoln, Einstein, as well as contemporary thinkers) .. This book, if you let it, will give you a lot of things to think about.. and give you hope for better things to come.  I didn't know before I bought it that it was an \\"Oprah Selected\\" book, as to me, with no ill-will toward Oprah, might cause some to think of the book as the latest \\"Pop sensation\\" ... this book in my estimation, goes well beyond that.<br /><br />Some will dismiss this book as fluff, I say, where's the harm?

0061537969|5.0|I knew I was in trouble when tears were forming in the corners of my eyes before the end of first chapter of The Art of Racing in the Rain: A Novel by Garth Stein. I am a dog lover, so my opinion of this book may be biased but I would venture that most folks would fall under the spell of Enzo, a lab/terrier/? mix who, as narrator, reflects on his life. Enzo's philosophical  views on the world are largely based on his family, watching documentaries and The Weather Channel (\\"it's about the world\\"), tapes from his \\"owner\\" Denny's racing career and visits to the racetrack. He is frustrated with his lack of thumbs and lack of voice. He cannot wait to come back as a human someday. He is a constant in a family that faces many crises. Another constant is racing. Denny is an aspiring race-car driver working his way up through the circuits. Enzo compares living a good life to what it takes to be a great driver.  It is not only about going fast.  Now, I am not a race fan. I have never really understood the driving around the same path over and over but I must admit, I have a different perspective of the sport after reading this book.<br /><br />Garth Stein's writing is thought-provoking and honest. Enzo's narration is so compelling and believable. He is able to see the wonder of being human even if we have forgotten. I found myself looking at my dogs and nodding in agreement with Enzo's thoughts. Mr. Stein's descriptions of racing, what it is like behind the wheel and what it takes to be a great racer are beautiful. If being a driver is akin to Mr. Stein's depiction, I now understand the need for speed.<br /><br />Do you need to be a dog lover or race fan or both to enjoy this book?  I should hope not.[[ASIN:0061537969 The Art of Racing in the Rain: A Novel]]
B000YABIQ6|5.0|I still find it hard to beleive that HBO passed on this series, since they have had some of the best television shows in recent memory, incuding Oz, Entourage, Six Feet Under and of course the Sopranos.  I think I orginally heard of this because of that happening and decided to pick this up to see what HBO missed.    Mad Men is about the 1960s and you feel like you are there, with all the nuances of the times that are not here, rightly or wrongly, here today.  The drinking and smoking that was so prevalent of the times ( I vauguely recall similar things happening from when I was a child, though it was alot later than this series, but were still relatviely social norms at the time.)    It is all Father Knows Best pushed into reality, where the men were the bread winners and the woman stayed home or were relgated to less meaningful jobs.  The things that are often subject to the internet emails you get along the lines of \\"How Did People Survive?\\"  (i.e., smoking, drinking, no seat bet type emails) permeates the entire show and there is the sense of how did people get by like that when we look at it today.  Not as an indictment, but more as that was then and not now.    Very well filmed and written.  Matthew Weiner's touch is still as strong as ever.    Great show.

This book really does grip you and shake you around a bit- I felt like an emotional wreck the whole way through. I never thought I'd be happy to say that. I loved the characters, storyline, and the ending (can't say that about too many novels that I've read lately).     I was going to write my review immediately after finishing the book, but decided I'd better wait a couple of days just in case my recent streak of disappointing reading may have caused me to rank this more highly than it really deserves. However, I'm still feeling the affects of this book a few days later. My Sister's Keeper is one of those rare books that hangs around and haunts you, exactly what I expect a well-told tale to do.

B001AVCFJM|5.0|This refitted Star Trek pays homage to the original in many ways but makes it clear this isn't grandpa's classic show. JJ Abrams wasn't afraid to enhance, indulge or flat out change the overhaul of this newest of takes on Star Trek. What he didn't lose was the heart of the Star Trek and the shows incessant need to display basic human struggles up against a space back drop. Abrams starts out this adventure before the original series began. The crew of the U.S.S Enterprise is young and scrappy but they will entertain on every level and far exceed expectations along with out classing every previous Trek film.     Story/Writing (Fresh & Witty) This Movie had a box to stay in in regards to not losing the soul of the original series. Not an easy task but one that was accomplished with flying colors. The story was original & brilliant despite the series being over forty. Trek takes liberties and yes some trekkie fans will require binkies due to not being able to handle them but they were all well thought out and clever.     Acting (Brilliant & Honest): A well rounded group of actors and Abrams ensures they all deliver. While all the players were great some were truly exceptional e.g. Nero, new Spock & new McCoy. Nero (Eric Bana) was a totally fresh character that Mr. Bana formed into a diabolical villain. McCoy (Keith Urban) was owned by Mr. Urban that's the only way to phrase it. Spock (Zachary Quinto) like every thing else played by Mr. Quinto is a force of nature. Kirk (Chris Pine) is given a solid performance by Mr. Pine. What he doesn't do is try to hard to imitate Shatner (thank god) but instead gives him is own artistic view. This is why the acting was great because the actors were free to interpret not imitate.     Special effects (Crisp and Edgy): Thats the biggest shock from old to new is now the effects look real. The bridge is now full of life with electronic pings, beautiful tactical displays and finally a bridge that is fitting for a star ship. Space battlesare voracious and stunning. The effects in Trek come fast, hit hard and help this to be one of the best sci-fi movies of the last ten years.     Last take (Fun, fun & did I mention fun): This is a great family movie for all people trekkie or not. It was funnier knowing about star trek lore due to a couple jokes they throw in but most of the movie was geared towards everyone. So stop the hesitation and go see it.      Final thought: Most entertaining movie of the summer 09 hands down.

B00260HH3K|1.0|If you had taken the same actors and the same premise and changed the characters names to utterly separate this film from Dragonball, it would still be terrible.  The acting, production quality, and script are comparable to a few Straight-To-Video flims from the 1980s, and that's if I'm being generous.  If not for the run of the mill CG, one could swear that this film were made in the 80's.  If this film were a Sci-Fi channel original movie, and if none of the characters were named after Dragonball characters, it still wouldn't have been very good.    From the reviews on this site it looks like the people who give it a high rating are either very generous, hated Dragonball, were paid off, or are trolling people who post their honest opinions.        Here's a bit from a synopsis a good friend wrote. the rest is available here: [...]     \\"Original Muten Roshi: Old lecherous martial arts master who lives at Kame House with Turtle and spends most of his time chasing skirts or looking through magazines for them.                Movie Master Roshi: Chow Yun Fat.  Really.  That's his costume.                        Demon King Piccolo: Planet Namek, a peaceful place, suffered a wide natural disaster so they sent Kami off into space so at least one Namek would survive. When Kami made the dragonballs he had to purge the evil from his heart and split in twain, which is how Piccolo was born.                Lord Piccolo: From an evil alien race known as Nameks, he tried to destroy the world 2000 years ago but was trapped somehow.  Now he's back, and angry, and looks like the Dorian Tyrell version of The Mask crossed with the Green Goblin.  And also he's working with Mai for some reason.                        Mai: that chick with the anthro dog companion.  Worked for Emperor Pilaf.  Not very effective.                Movie Mai: A bad ass gun toting martial arts ninja master mary sue who can also transform into other people if she steals their blood (wat?) and can leap off high buildings and vanish liek ninja.  No idea why she's working with Piccolo.                        Grandpa Gohan: Old martial artist who has a dragonball, stomped to death by Goku in his oozaru form.                Movie Grandpa Gohan: Old martial artist who gave Goku the ball for his birthday, taught him how to use ki blasts, and is later crushed by his own house when Piccolo shows up and uses Force Crush on the house... really.. does the hand gesture and everything...  And the sad thing is this character is by far the most accurate, but only because he's dead in the original and dies in the movie.                        Son Goku: A Saiyan baby found by grandpa Gohan, got a head injury and was raised as a nice little boy.  Transforms into an oozaru when looking at the full moon until his tail is removed.                Goku (or as the school bullies call him, Geek-o) : Sent to earth in a meteor by Piccolo, during a solar eclipse he transforms into a guy named Oozaru, who is Piccolo's servant.. and only about a foot taller than he is originally... Think of the Brutes from Halo 3. Also he doesn't have a tail.  And goes to high school.  And is kinda emo since nobody likes him.                        ChiChi: Daughter of the mighty Ox King, a decent fighter herself.                Movie ChiChi: The hot love interest who at the beginning of the movie is hanging out with all those jerks who make Goku sad... bawww! But once he shows her that he can use his Ki to open her stuck locker, she is impressed and invites him to her party! Because like all teen drama love interests, she is having one, and until this point our hero was not invited =p  This Chichi is also a martial artist, but she fights in competitions. Boring.                        Bulma: Blue haired genius daughter of Dr. Briefs.  Built the Dragon Radar to find the balls and wish for the perfect boyfriend.                Movie Bulma: Looks like a cross between UltraViolet and a reject from Matrix Online.  She has black hair... with two small blue hair falls that she probably got at hot topic.  She built a thing that's like a dragon radar, but looks nothing like it, and is called something else entirely.  She wants the balls to make herself famous by using them as a perpetual energy source (wat?)                        Yamcha: A desert bandit with a floating cat companion.  He's deathly afraid of girls at first.                Movie Yamcha: A bandit who traps our heroes in a pit trap. Not afraid of girls.  Looks nothing like Yamcha. He looks like a j-rocker with spiky bleach blonde hair.                        And no, there was no Krillin, Puar, Oolong, Launch, Tienshinhan, Chaotsu, or anyone else from the original.  This is a good thing though as fans of those characters won't have to seethe over the utter rape of their favorite characters.\\"

B0018PH3L0|5.0|I have never been disappointed with anything from Amazon.  A couple of times there have been gliches, but they were immediately resolved.  Amazon is one of my favorite places.  I think I am addicted.  And, also, the prices are the best anywhere.

B00008FKDJ|4.0|Swordfishtrombones is a collection of raps & recitals, bluesy & jazzy excursions, diner torch songs and instrumentals with spare backing plus one lavishly backed melodious ballad in the style of Jersey Girl on [[ASIN:B000002GWR Heartattack and Vine]]. Underground is a brooding recital while 16 Shells From A 30-6 is a type of emphatic spoken blues in a voice more gravelly than normal. Examples of other talking styles include Frank's Wild Years where Hammond organ and acoustic bass provide edgy backing; the percussive title track where the vocal hovers between talking & singing, and the jittery Trouble's Braids on which Waits's semi-whispered vocal is backed by African talking & Parade bass drums plus acoustic bass.<br /><br />He sings on the boisterous Down Down Down with its jazzy texture and on atmospheric art songs like the lament Town With No Cheer, the short love song Johnsburg, Illinois and the moving Soldier's Things, tender moments that interrupt the rough pieces and jazz raps. Of the instrumentals, the gentle Rainbirds brings to mind Leonard Cohen's Tacoma Trailer on [[ASIN:B0012GMVDK The Future]]. For those who prefer their Waits in more traditional style there's the magnificent ballad In The Neighborhood, reminiscent of his early 1970s masterpieces like [[ASIN:B000002GYR Ole 55]] and I Hope that I Don't Fall in Love with You.<br /><br />Predominantly experimental, Swordfishtrombones may not appeal to all fans as the album is dominated by minimalist raps resembling the quirky work of [[ASIN:B000FDJ2VK Captain Beefheart]]. Moreover, it takes some time & patience to understand and appreciate the other, more delicate compositions with their melancholic emotional tone. It's definitely worth the effort though, since a gem like Soldier's Things must ultimately be counted amongst Tom's most accomplished and memorable work.

B001IAOEXU|5.0|I always thought the PS3's triggers weren't all that great.  So, I found a set of these at my local gamestop, and for $4.99, you really can't go wrong.  These things pop in place so easily, and once they are on, they stay on.  And not only that, the buttons match so perfectly that they look like the controller came from the factory like that.  I mean, perfect match.  It even has the number \\"2\\" on it in the exact place it should, and it's typed in the correct font.  The color is exactly the same and the texture is exactly the same.  I can't believe this isn't a Sony-made product, because you sure can't tell that it's not.  This is how the controller should come right out of the box, but since it doesn't, spend $5 and no one but you will ever know that it didn't come that way out of the box!!!

The book was in perfect condition, exactly how they described it.  I loved this book and can't wait to read more of Carlos Zafon's books.  He is an exceptional writer and kept me capitivated throughout the whole book. This book rates an A+ for me.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|The album already has over 500 reviews on Amazon, alot of them really well worded and detailed, so I'll be brief.  This album did take some getting used to, but I've come to think it's Maiden's best work, and that is from someone who owns every Maiden album and loves all of them.  It's at least as good as Number of the Beast, but very different and, I think, marginally better.    Give the album a chance and I think you'll be very pleased.
B000V86OKG|5.0|Season 2 is basically about the aftermath of the Ice truck killer case. The garbage bags containing Dexter's victims are discovered at the bottom of the ocean and an FBI investigation is launched into finding the 'Bay Harbor Butcher', a moniker Dexter despises. Dexter must perform his duties as the blood spatter expert while trying to keep one step ahead of the investigation. Dokes however still suspects Dexter and his determination to expose Dexter for what he is leads to some interesting confrontations. Dexter also admits to Rita that he framed the father of her children to keep him away from her. In the process he basically had to lie to Rita about where he got the drugs to prevent her from digging deeper into his personal life. He does this by stating hes an addict, which of course he isn't. To appease Rita he attends meetings with recovering addicts where he meets what proves to be a pivotal character in the season, his sponsor Lyla. During the season Dexter's desire to learn about his past grows stronger, primarily about his birth mother and Harry's motives. This season is just amazing, as are all 3. Anthony Michael Hall plays what is a very complicated role as Dexter extremely well. His girlfriend Rita is played by Julie Benz who is absolutely stunning. She provides normalcy for what is otherwise a complex existence for Dexter. As always there are twists and turns around every corner that keep you on your toes. Five stars all the way!!

B000WS4QJG|5.0|I am very happy with the new Thriller CD and DVD.  There are extra tracks on the end of the CD, which is a plus.  Although it's cool to have some of the new, hip muscial artists (Fergie, Kayne West, etc.) singing on some of these extra tracks (Billie Jean, Beat It, etc.), they're more like karaoke singers singing along with the original songs.  Great buy, though.  Getting a DVD along with CD is an automatic.

B001BSBBEE|5.0|Some brilliant directors only make a few movies. Herk Harvey made over four hundred -- but sadly, he only brought his astounding talents into one non-educational movie.<br /><br />That one brilliant movie is cult horror flick \\"Carnival of Souls,\\" a nightmarish tale of a young woman who is lingering on in the world of the living -- and is pursued by the dead. Made for a piddling seventeen thousand dollars, this little gem is as eerie now as it was in the 1960s.<br /><br />Three young women decide to drag race a car of young men -- and their car goes off a bridge into the river. Only Mary (Candace Hilligoss) staggers out of the water, seemingly undisturbed by the accident. The next day she travels to Utah for her new job as a church organist, but on the trip she keeps seeing a grinning, corpselike man watching her from the road.<br /><br />Mary tries to distract herself with shopping, dodging her lecherous neighbor, and playing the organ. But she keeps seeing the corpse-man), having strange moments where nobody can see or ear her, and also finds herself drawn to a run-down former carnival pavilion. As the dead close in on her, Mary runs from them. But she can't escape what has already happened.<br /><br />A simple plot, but Herk Harvey handles it with brilliant skill. There's a goofy moment here or there -- at one point Mary turns around to shriek into the camera lens. But most of the time, Harvey keeps the atmosphere piling on, with relatively little dialogue (the most memorable lines are usually shrieked ones like \\"I don't want to be alone!\\").<br /><br />In short, Harvey had the ability to inspire something a lot rarer than fear or shocks -- dread. Mary's confusion, fear and denial are almost palpable as she wanders through the town. By the climax, it has transformed into a sort of nightmarish maze that Mary can just run through, with the dead people just a few steps behind her. And there's that creepy organ music all the time.<br /><br />The ending is not so much a twist as the inevitable answer to all the bizarre events that came before it -- and it's a brilliant, bittersweet ending. Suddenly the \\"invisibility\\" moments and the dead faces make perfect sense, and we understand that Mary was not meant to be where she was -- having never lived, she could not bear to accept the inevitable.<br /><br />Mary is also not your typical early-sixties heroine -- she's sharp-tongued (\\"Thank you, but I'm NEVER coming back here\\") and kind of spinsterish by nature. What's more, she is completely detached from everyone around her, since she is not meant to be in the world of the living. Hilligoss (who only made one other movie) is absolutely amazing here, with her distant attitude and frightened eyes.<br /><br />Brilliant and creepy, \\"Carnival of Souls\\" is a deserving cult classic. It's a shame that Herk Harvey never made another horror flick, but at least we have this one.bizarre events that came before it -- and it's a brilliant, bittersweet ending.

0385520298|5.0|Why do some \\"reviewers\\" feel the need to fill three paragraphs with re-recaps of the story line?     I had the good fortune to find the English version of this book in my local library in Paris France; being a foreigner here, who gets by with my broken French, I felt I would find a connection in this book, and I did.  I thought I had trouble with making cultural adjustments from the States to France; at least we share the same alphabet and have the same types of grammar rules.     Considering the broken English used throughout, it got to be very easy to read after a short while, and I zipped through it in a few days during my commute. We are immediately thrown into Z's world, and by introducing each chapter in the form of a word she's learned, and its dictionary meaning, we are given a preview of things to come.     Spoiler alert below!!!        this book is a tearjerker
B00005N6KG|3.0|I've purchased more than 10 pairs of these over the last 3 years. They last about 4 months each before one side or the other stops working.  This is because a wire breaks, usually at the ear phone.  There is some strain relief inside the headset, but if you use these a lot, you're going to find yourself ordering multiple sets to keep a working pair around.  I listen to audiobooks almost exclusively and the sound quality is fine for that.  They fit adequately and are cooler than the padded headphones.  If I could something that worked better, I would.  However, this is all that I can find that isn't too hot to wear in the summer heat that works for me.  Thicker wires is what is really needed here, even though it might raise the electrical resistance slightly.
0316044695|5.0|Lone Survivor is a real piece of history. It showed an event through the eyes of a true American hero. I noticed a lot of negative reviews. Some explaining how its ridiculous that Mr. Luttrell believed that liberal Americans played a part in the death of his three friends. I would like to explain that this was a book based on the feelings of the author and in no way they should play a part in decided if this is a good story. This is the feelings of the story teller and doesn't change the fact that it is amazing story about an American hero.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|This is by far the best invention as an accessory to a stroller that doesn't come with a cup holder. Not only it's easy to use; it can hold up to 2 cups/bottles of almost any size, you can also put your cel phone or snack in the middle tray. It is easy to install and easy to wash. Great job, amazon! I'd highly recommend this to every mom out there.
B0000DJZ8R|2.0|I recently watched GRAPES with my 16-year-old daughter (she had to read the novel for school, and I thought it would be fun to revisit the film). When I first saw the movie, years ago, I thought it was a decent adaptation of an American literary classic.<br /><br />Since then, my critical thinking skills have improved a lot--now I recognize this as a thinly-veiled propagandist piece that pits luckless Okies against dastardly Agribusiness predators. Very simplistic and heavy-handed--unbelievably so.<br /><br />It's hard to believe that John Ford, who directed THE SEARCHERS (probably the greatest American film ever made), was also responsible for this.<br /><br />The acting was good, though how can it not be with this cast? And there were moments of humor and poignancy.<br /><br />But Tom Joad, heroic Everyman? Not. From the very first scene, we learn that he is recently paroled from prison (homicide); he hitches a ride on a truck, forcing the driver to break his company's rules against giving lifts. Right away, you know this guy is a rule-breaker and pretty much does whatever he feels like.<br /><br />So if Joad can go through life like that, why can't these big orchard owners? The only thing that separates Joad from his persecuters is that they made sound business decisions and he did not.<br /><br />Also, the whole forced Dustbowl-westward migration was horrible (read THE WORST HARD TIME if you're interested in this chapter of our history), but Joad et al are stunned to be kicked off \\"their\\" land....and they're all SHARECROPPERS!! They don't OWN the land, but it's LIKE they own the land, because they've lived on it for so long, so they're outraged when the people who DO own the land tell them to move. (Can you say, \\"squatter\\"?)<br /><br />Hmm....maybe the actual landowners were ALSO affected by the Depression and had to make some tough decisions.<br /><br />GRAPES OF WRATH--the movie and the book--have become the go-to sources for all things Depression. Watch or read, whatever, to inform your opinion of what happened in the 1930's, but remember--this is largely FICTION.1930's, but remember--this is largely FICTION.
0679735909|5.0|This is my second reading and I enjoyed it soooo much more than the first time when I was impatient at all the pseudo-19th century poetry. I think I liked it better because I paid more (not less) attention to the poetry and was blown away that Byatt could do that--could not only make up two 19th century poets as characters but could write their poetry for them. I also didn't take the book all that seriously the first time--finding it fun but \\"unserious\\". I obviously didn't notice that she prefaced it by those great lines about \\"romance\\" from Hawthorne's introduction to The House of the Seven Gables: \\"When a writer calls his work a Romance, it need hardly be observed that he wishes to claim a certain latitude, both as to its fashion and material, which he would not have felt himself entitled to had he professed to be writing a novel.\\" A distinction generally lost in our time, but an important one and one that fits this work perfectly; it does not aim at fidelity to the possible or to the probable, but it does aim at the \\"truth of the human heart\\".<br /><br />I have always been fascinated by the author who builds a novel (or a romance) out of diverse documents which the characters come across, in this case not only the poems of the two poets, but their letters, a few stories retold from parents, journals of those closely involved--his wife and her lover, critical analysis and biography by scholars, etc. Even some fanciful sections where the author imagines events and feelings on the part of 19th century characters that could not have been known, even through the serendipity of finding the documents that were found. Having read a great deal more of Byatt than when I first read this novel, I see this tendency to weave documents into the story as characteristic of her as a writer, used most effectively in her recent novel, The Children's Book, just nominated for this year's Booker.<br /><br />Possession is about two young academics in the 1980s who form a partnership based on a common interest in the two poets whose romance is discovered accidentally in a letter found in a old book owned by one of the poets and currently residing in the London Library. It's a mystery, with clues that lead to a cache of letters in the turret on a dilapidated estate, to Brittany, back England and a metal box buried by the wife of one of the lovers. The story is a \\"romance\\" in both senses of the word: a story about love and passion and a book that's full of coincidence and improbability in everything except its human joy and tragedy and redemption. And of course the two young academics fall in love too, slowly and as believably as their 19th century counterparts. It's a tale of academic rivalry too, as the scholars jockey for position around \\"the find\\" the original pair can't keep hidden--academic rivalry that rises to high comedy and even farce.nterest in the two poets whose romance is discovered accidentally in a letter found in a old book owned by one of the poets and currently residing in the London Library.

B000GIXLO8|4.0|If you haven't seen the extended versions of this trilogy you have just never seen the movies! The extended version has double the Chapters! I highly recommend these movies and primarily, these extended versions. Just DO NOT PURCHASE FROM 'buy now ship [...]. I had to make a duplicate purchase on the DVD I ordered from them. I'm guessing 'buy now ship now' is great as long as there's no problem but, if you have any kind of a problem with their merchandise or order or whatever and they even THINK they may not get a perfect review. . . well, too bad for you. And I ordered 7 DVD's from various sellers at the same time and they were by far the slowest to ship, as well. They were within the time parameters but took a week longer nonetheless. They're just not very nice to do business with, at all. IF YOU ORDER FROM 'buy now ship [...], IT'S AT YOUR PERIL. BEWARE!! However, I highly recommend the movies, (even though one wouldn't play the last 6 Chapters), I didn't even mind replacing it at my own expense, (from a different seller of course)! That's how much I loved the product!

B001MYIXAC|1.0|This is a film with a lot of loaded dialogue, carefully chosen words, subtle meanings. I've seen both the foreign-made subtitles and the domestic version. After watching the domestic version with \\"redone\\" subtitles, I was shocked at how much was lost in the process. I'm astounded that this was done in the first place, let alone approved and marketed.     The new domestic subtitles are nowhere near as good... which makes this particular film a lot less intelligent and subtle. I'm waiting for another region release.
B000002UA5|5.0|It is always educational to hear a mega band before they hit  big. Deep Purple applies, as does Pink Floyd. Marquee names at London's UFO club, Floyd was a experimental psych unit years before Dark Side Of The Moon put them on every kid's Maranz. Ummagumma shows Floyd in their lab;  a great band testing sounds they don't know where to take yet.<br /><br />Two discs: one live and one studio. On the concert disc, the band jams on tracks from their first two albums. \\"Astomonmy Domaine\\" is changed from a Barret tab to subtle art rock. \\"Careful With That Ax Eugene\\"  rests on Water's spare bass framework, and is probably the first time in the band Gilmore opens up with his soloing. The other two tracks, from \\"Suacer Full Of Secrets\\" show Floyd's early snuggling with classical avant-garde. The crowd is mostly mixed out,  adding the nuance this is a rock recital, not a party gig.<br /><br />The studio disc furthers the modern classical ideas Flyod started on disc one. Each member has his own composition. Wright does a fright night keyboard suite. Water's plays with accustic guitar and tape loops. Gilmore plays with dissonce and melody, and Mason does a masterful percussion blowout.<br /><br />The sound is great. Only the Beatles and Hendrix used stereo seperation, brand new in 1969, as effectively as Floyd does here. Listen to how the fly buzzes back and fourth on Water's animal piece, as the cymbals slice through your tweeters on Mason's.<br /><br />Like this? Do something old fashioned. Ask mom and dad for their old  headphones--ear-covering cans, not the micro  peices  they make now-turn out the lights and play the whole album. You'll understand why a good stereo was imporatent back in the stone age.<br /><br />Ummagumma is a scrapbook of ideas Pink Floyd would later intagrate into their more streemlined, commercial albums. For me, the gambit testing  here is edgey and exciting, emotionally driven and never accidemic.<br /><br />Fantasticly mature psychadelia.
B0009MAP9A|5.0|This won't really be a helpful review,but,to be honest,I really don't care since I hate writing reviews.I'm bored and have too much time on my hands so I'm just doing this to kill time.The only reason that I bought this CD was because it was recommended to me by Amazon and I felt that I needed it to add to my collection(I am attempting to acquire as many of the greatest albums of all-time that I can afford and this one,as well as many other Dylan albums,made the list).I also got a great deal on it.Would I recommend this to someone who doesn't even like Dylan?No,because it won't change their opinion of him.The trademark raspy voice is there as well as the sometimes annoying harmonica playing.What I feel makes this album essential is not necessarily the singing or playing,but the words themselves.It's refreshing to know that at one time in history people really did care enough about their country's situation and the times they were living in to write such topical songs as this.The name of the album(as well as the title track)boasts the catchphrase,\\"the times they are a-changin'\\",which has been used frequently since the release of this album and may still even be used today(by babyboomers who grew up in the '60s,no doubt).This is definitely of an era when young people were more connected to what was going on around them,a situation that,sadly,no longer exists today.There's far too much ignorance and indifference in this modern Internet-fuelled age and young people nowadays are more concerned with their own personal interests rather than the situation their country's in or helping their fellow man.
1932907009|5.0|Read this book through and found it to have really useful tips and techniques for pursuing scriptwriting.
B000000XBC|5.0|I bought this collection for two reasons.One,because it features Creedence Clearwater Revival's version of the late,great Ricky Nelson's \\"Hello Mary Lou\\"(a song written by the late,great Gene Pitney)that I had heard on a radio program(and I didn't necessarily want to purchase the original CCR album that it appears on,\\"Mardi Gras\\",their last).Secondly,I've owned the first(and more popular)edition of Chronicle for many years in different formats(first on vinyl,then cassette,and,finally,on CD).This disc makes a nice companion to that first volume,and,with that,as the title of my review states,is all the CCR you'll ever need.It's also nice that each volume appears on a single disc,so this is a worthwhile upgrade for the comparably bulkier 2 record vinyl sets of these releases.
B0017ANAZO|3.0|Overall, I love the acting of nearly all of the cast members in this movie--just not in this particular flick. I too saw and loved the original and was thrilled to see a remake. Even before I received it, I read the Amazon reviews but still wanted to see it for myself. Unfortunately, I agree with most of the negative reviews. The actors, though generally outstanding in other vehicles, just weren't good in this endeavor. The acting was noticeably bad. The only standouts for me were Cloris Leachman and Debra Messing at the end. She was hilarious to me. In fact, her character seemed to have the only real honest reactions in the whole movie. I did enjoy the beautiful scenery and fabulous fashions.  I also actually liked the soundtrack which I'm going to check out further. Bottom line? Wait until it comes out on cable or network TV.
B002BFBAWO|4.0|\\"Adventureland\\" is a mildly sweet comedy-drama in the \\"coming of age\\" genre of films written and produced by Greg Mottola (the director of \\"Superbad\\") and based on his own experiences working at an amusement park in the late 1980s.  The film is set in the same era, giving it a somewhat timeless feel and tone that makes it look and feel as though it were made in that same era.  The storyline of diminished expectations, coming to terms with post-collegiate life, and the evolution and changing nature of friendships are similarly universal and timeless.  The story follows James Brennan (wonderfully underplayed by Jesse Eisenberg), a college grad whose life is rapidly changing.  His girlfriend breaks up with him and he returns home with hopes of touring Europe followed by Grad school only to discover his parents can't pay for either due to a change in economic circumstances.  James moves in with his parents and realizes his only ticket to grad school is a summer job, but his comparative lit degree leaves his employment options limited.  Desperate, he takes a job at the Adventureland amusement park, the latest in a series of blows to his psyche.<br /><br />Most of the film revolves around the odd cast of characters James encounters while working at Adventureland.  They become his new cohort of friends and a romance slowly blossoms between James and Emily (Kristen Stewart).  But all isn't as it seems as Emily is also involved with the worldly and mysterious Connell (played to perfection by Ryan Reynolds).  The triangle plays out against the other relationships in this tight circle of friends over the summer.  They bicker, they fight, they drink, and they misunderstand.  I'm boiling the plot down a lot here as it does get quite involved and I certainly don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen it. As summer comes to a close there's the question of who Emily will stay with: the flawed and possibly unavailable Connell or James, who is leaving for New York City and grad school.  The ending may seem formulaic but it's hardly clich&eacute;d and will leave you happy and satisfied.<br /><br />Ads for \\"Adventureland\\" touted it as coming from the director of \\"Superbad\\" but that's about where the comparisons end.  There is certainly raunchy humor, vulgarity, and adult humor, but not to the level of \\"Superbad.\\"  The music is period perfect too mixing in 80s groups like Husker Du, the Replacement's and Falco's \\"Rock Me Amadeus\\" (used to hilarious effect).  There's a certain wistfulness to the movie that borders on nostalgic poignancy for a simpler time that has passed away and in a real sense it's easier to set a movie like this in the recent past rather than our disconnected present.  People working dead end summer jobs of today likely don't connect like this group does.  \\"Adventureland\\" was sadly overlooked while out in theaters but it is certainly worth a second look.  While not the most memorable film its oddly affecting plot and great cast is certainly enjoyable..  The ending may seem formulaic but it's hardly clichéd and will leave you happy and satisfied.

0394721780|5.0|When you start to use this cookbook, it is easy to understand why it has remained a classic since 1961.  It is not like the usual cookbook with big, beautiful photographs, a long list of ingredients and directions on putting everything together.  It includes commentary by Julia Child that is really funny sometimes and very useful in understanding how the various ingredients work to make the dish.  And, not all the recipes require hours to assemble.  The vegetable dishes, in particular, are fairly easy.<br /><br />I just made Boeuf A La Bourguignonne (Beef Stew) from this book that is included in the movie, \\"Julia & Julia\\", for a pre-theater gathering at my house.  I served the dish as an appetizer so my friends would know what it tasted like when we went to see the movie.  Everyone loved it.  When you make this dish, it is easy to see why it is so different from most other beef stew recipes.  Each of the ingredients--stew beef, pearl onions, mushrooms, carrots, onions-- is treated individually to get the most flavor and then combined at the end to make the dish.  Fantastic flavor!  It is so rich that it just melts in your mouth.<br /><br />If you love French food and want to make some in your home, get this book.  This is the definitive book on the subject and it is not that hard to make incredible dishes.<br /><br />I have made these dishes:  Salade Nicoise, Ratatouille, Whole Baked Tomatoes, Chicken Breasts with Mushrooms and Cream, Fish Filets poached in White Wine and Eggs Baked in Ramekins.  I highly recommend each.
B000002UC5|5.0|I love this album.  It always makes me feel like I have been invited into Paul McCartney's farm house while he was creating this music.  I recommend listening to the whole album each time because it has a flow where one song leads to the next.  He so loved Linda and his children and it shines through in each song.  I find it to be a romantic poem which can sometimes be touching, sometimes silly and sometimes passionate.  I have never owned this on CD only a record.  The photos taken by Linda are what also makes the album so special.  They are intimate and sweet as if you were looking through their own personal photo album.  I know the album is just called McCartney, but I have always referred to it as \\"Cherries On the Sidewalk\\", because of the interesting cover shot.  If you enjoy music that tells a story and allows you a window into an artist's soul, you will love this album.
B00000IQCA|5.0|What a wonderfully funny and nearly ageless movie! I have had the DVD for 7 years and have returned to it time and time again. Its still fresh and lively. Robert Altman outdid himself. Bravo!
B000UG78NG|5.0|This review could easily be a repetition of the same theme you see in so many Amazon reviews: a short recap of the work, followed by a dissection of what the author did well or didn't do well. Instead of all that prattle, what is important is that \\"The Name of the Wind\\" was an extremely enjoyable book, well worth the $9.99 Kindle price I paid for it, and left me hungering for the next installment in the series. Fantasy writers often get overly impressed with their own imaginations, and construct worlds that are so fantastical, that the reader has a hard time \\"attaching\\" to it. Rothfuss creates an alternate \\"here\\", a fantastical \\"now\\". The world he paints on page isn't so different than our own, as much a reflection of it...antagonists are realistic and understandable, nights can be cold, cuts bleed (sometimes.) and magic comes at a price. You will not find \\"easy-outs\\" or plot loopholes here. There are no \\"magical vials of luck which just happen to be the key to advancing the story\\" moments here (I'm looking at you, J.K. Rowling.) If you can appreciate gritty, real, and ultimately gripping fantasy, you've found a remarkable book written by a remarkable author.
0517548232|1.0|The only economic lessons in it are a very biased critique of any economic policy other than capitalist doctrine.  I wanted to learn about economics and was so disappointed in this outdated, one-sided book.
0802798225|5.0|Well, I'm not going to say much since I'm not very good at it. But I can say that since the moment I started reading this book I couldn't put it down until I finished it and went to sleep at 6 in the morning since I started at night.     This book as it all, drama, romance, comedy... a little bit of everything, I fell in love with the characters and their story. Simone Elkeles is an extraordinary writer. I read [[ASIN:0738710180 Leaving Paradise]] and again finished it in a day. I'm happy she's doing sequels on both of those books, I hope they're all as good, she's on my list of my favorite authors.     I highly recomend this book on both, young adults and adults, you won't be disappointed. Enjoy it!
B002C2XXJY|5.0|I am a HUGE Fan of Demi Lovato's 2008 debut album, Don't Forget. I didn't think that this one could be any better. THE album is a colection of unique songs that are sure to entertain and amuse fans of Ms. Lovato.

B002HHPVHQ|2.0|...it's impossible to think you could get a decent book that chronicles Lehman's demise with any amount of accuracy or objectivity. This book is all emotion, and self promotion. But I did love the summer before Lehman collapsed... much more memorable than this 'book'... I remember selling all those calls, and buying all those put options, strikes of $14, $10, $5, it was ridiculous, they were so priced up, but it didn't matter, lol! Now I'm waiting for the definitive book on AIG, and maybe CIT in a few months.     If you find out that there are some books on CIT in the works, then I'd say it's a definite short, who's gonna risk buying rights to a book about bankruptcy if it might not happen? Nobody.
0312383436|5.0|What if your wedding was just a few days away, and a secret from your past suddenly reappears?  Just a little sin of omission, something you forgot to tell anyone?  This is what happens to Milly, when her wedding photographer is the same person who took casual photos of her as a bride ten years ago, a wedding that she never told anyone about.  This was a marriage of convenience with a virtual stranger, and when Milly lost contact with the groom, she decided she could push the entire event far enough out of her mind to make it never exist.<br /><br />Milly's secret does get told, and she ends up in a maelstrom of hurt feelings and confusion, staring with her fianc&eacute;e, Simon.  The only son of a self-made wealthy man, Simon struggles with inadequacy and was determined to do one thing better than his father--have the perfect wedding.  Milly's mother has been frantically planning the wedding, with much vicarious pleasure in Milly's wealthy future.  Meanwhile, Milly's Dad is struggling with a mid-life crisis and her sister Isobel is facing a life changing decision of her own.<br /><br />In parallel to Milly's personal challenges, she sets off to find her first husband and secure a divorce.  This sub-plot adds an entirely different element to The Wedding Girl (no spoiler here!), and adds valuable elements to the story and to development of the characters.<br /><br />The Wedding Girl is a delightful story with a good mix of happy and sad that will cause the reader to think and enjoy.  I always enjoy books by Madeline Wickham aka Sophie Kinsella, and The Wedding Girl reminds me why I look forward to each one being released in the USA.

1881273628|5.0|This book is very simple but it does explain a lot of husband-wife behavior. Why you sometimes just don't get each other,  how you think you're giving your spouse what they need but you're really not, and how you hurt each other without meaning too. I think we've all been guilty of this behavior. If you would like to change that, then it is a must read.
B001NEK2GE|4.0|tl;dr:    Pros:  Ergonomic  Comfortable to use  Painless to setup, but make take a little time to get everything \\"just right\\"  Gamepanel is bright  Thumbstick and thumb keys are in easy reach  Keys feel high-quality  Wrist rest grips hand securely  Heavy and grips desk, won't slide around    Cons:  Only one brightness setting on the Gamepanel and keys  (on or off)  Thumbstick is very difficult to press down, and you'll probably tilt the stick doing so  Spacebar key could be placed a bit more conveniently, but not that big of a deal        Just got this guy in yesterday, and played with it in an FPS and in WoW for most of the day yesterday and this morning.    Ergonomics:  The first thing I noticed was, \\"wow, this is kinda big.  And heavy.\\"  But once I laid it on my desk and put my hand on it, it clicked.  The large keys go a long way to making this extremely comfortable to use.  My n52 had smaller (and fewer) keys.  The sloped design of the keys contour my hand perfectly.  The wrist-rest isn't so much a \\"rest\\" as it is a \\"grip\\"... it's comfortable, but the main function of it seems to be to grip your palm and not let go.  It's very nice.  A problem I always had with my n52 speedpad's hard plastic wrist rest was that my hand could tend to slide around.  Not with this.    To go back to the keys a second, the keys feel VERY nice.  They're full keyboard quality, though my G15 keyboard's keys feel slightly higher quality.  Still head and shoulders away from what I was expecting.  They're logitech-quality keys that you would expect to find on a keyboard.  Some of the keys on the extreme right are a bit of a stretch to reach, I only bound not-often-used functions to those keys.  The extreme top-left keys are easier to reach because your pinky is on that side and you don't have to take your index finger off of what would be the \\"D\\" key (in a WSAD setup) to reach them.  The bottom-right key on the keypad section is supposed to emulate the spacebar, but it's a little more difficult to reach than a traditional spacebar.  Not by much though.  I thought it was slightly awkward at first tucking my thumb in to reach it, but after using it a few hours I didn't pay it any attention.  Just part of the learning curve, I suppose.    The thumbstick was the thing about this that I was most apprehensive about.  Here's how I feel:  The thumbstick is in a good location, and is very springy and solid-feeling.  However I wouldn't use it for movement (camera, character, or otherwise).  Instead, I use it like a 4-way hat-switch like you'd find on a flightstick.  Just something to flick your thumb against when you need to do something quickly.  There is a button when you press the stick down, but holy mother of God... it's very difficult to push down, and you will almost invariably tilt the stick in the process and activate whatever you bound to that direction.    My thumb most naturally rests against the large button to the left of the stick.  Both of these buttons near the thumbstick are very easy to reach, and feel very secure pressing them down, with a satisfying \\"click\\", like a mouse key, only with more key travel.      Screen:  The screen is almost identical to the 2nd rev G15's, however in this case you can change the backlighting to any color you want (the keys as well).  The screen is brighter than the G15's, but unfortunately it only has 2 settings; backlit or off.  I thought this was a major oversight, as I don't want it full brightness all the time, like in a darkened room.  It's not that huge of a deal because since it's off to the left, the screen isn't shining directly in your face.  If this were my keyboard I was reviewing, I'd care a bit more about this.  I think this is the device's only glaring flaw.  The screen sits at a good angle on my desk, though I wish I had the option to adjust it slightly more up, or at least have the option to prop the entire pad up on little feet like you'd find on a keyboard, but I digress.  In the end it's very bright, very legible.  One cool thing is that you can make the backlighting a different color for every memory mode (of which there are 3).    For my GamePanel setup, I keep game-related information on the G15 keyboard and I keep system utility information on the G13's screen.  Since it sits off to the left, you won't want to be looking at it very often during gameplay, however a G15 sitting directly under your screen is easy enough to glance down at.  But whenever I say, \\"Huh, this framerate is kinda sluggish, what does my RAM load look like right now?  How is my CPU doing?\\", I can look over and see for myself without alt-tabbing to look at a system diagnostic utility.  Very, very convenient.  (I recommend SirReal's gamepanel app for this purpose.  You can find it on [...])    Ze Software:  Not much to say about this.  It's identical to the G15's software, and lives in the same management utility.  You can record macros, keystrokes, etc.  I've only used mine to bind to specific keyboard keys, and I haven't played with macros any yet, so I have no experience there.      I tried one FPS, and basically had to build a profile for it.  Mapped the WSAD keys, the R key for reload, etc.  Got it set up quickly and was able to play very easily.    Ahh, but where this shines is in the MMO space.  It allowed me to play WoW almost immediately after plugging it in, already having mapped the WSAD keys for me, and the top row of keys corresponded to 1 through 5 I believe.  However this didn't last long, as I spent the time to completely reconfigure the key bindings, and used an action-bar add-on (Dominos) to build an onscreen set of action bars that are physically laid out like the keys on this pad.  It's worked incredibly well so far.  I already feel like I have 3x the buttons underneath my fingertips.  In the past, if the hotkey wasn't on number 1 through 5, it basically didn't get used, or I clicked on it manually.  It wasn't convenient for my finger to reach it.  And so many times I've said to myself, \\"Now where did I stick that Concussive Shot button?\\", or worse, \\"I'm about to fall to my death, where did I put my parachute cloak button?\\"  And by the time I find it and click on it, it's too late.  Now, it feels like /everything/ is under my fingers in easy reach.      Overall, I'm extremely impressed.  It's not perfect, but in the world of gamepads for the PC, this is as close to perfect as you're going to get.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I had no desire to see a TV show about a serial killer. Too dark, too depressing, too gory and another one-hundred and one reasons I could come up with about not watching this show. Mainly, how can you like a show where the lead character so clearly affronts you? The Soporanos is my favorite drama of all-time, really got into 24 this past season but there's very few shows I've watched that just grabbed me and made me think about it long after watching it. Even fewer shows that I just anticipated watching and then along came Dexter. One long, lazy summer weekend I started watching Dexter on my local cable on-demand. I haven't even watched Showtime very much over the years, always thought it was a notch below HBO, foolish me. Dexter: The First Season is the most well-written, well-acted, well-directed, spine-tingling, can't take my eyes off the TV set, series I've seen since the Soprano's. It is a guilty pleasure. Yes, Dexter is a serial killer who is battling some pretty serious demons in the old family closet. I kept anticipating something happening which would turn my stomach and stop watching but it just kept pulling me in. Dexter is so charming, the writing so clever and tight and the other characters so well written that before I knew it I had watched all 12 episodes of the 1st season and couldn't wait to get started on Season 2. I love a tv show where you see twists and turns coming up and you figure, well how are they going to deal with that and bada bing the plot takes a twist that you never saw coming. Brilliant stuff! The bigggest surprise of this show is how moral it is, what with serial killers running around loose chopping people up, Dexter somehow finds this moral high ground that endears you to the main character and show. Not easy to do but brilliantly done here! Michael C. Hall is mesmerizing, Julie Benz a perfect doll, James Remar, a grounding force, Eric King is powerful, Jennifer Carter is great. Kudos to Lauren Velez, CS Lee and David Zayas.
B000001ESP|4.0|From the magestic filter sweep opening of Tom Sawyer, to the plucked harmonics of Red Barchetta, across the rhythmic ocean of YYZ and beyond - Moving Pictures stands as one of the greatest achievements of the band Rush.  I was in high school and had not yet been initiated into the world of Rush.  A good friend of mine constantly raved about the band and insisted that I would love them.  I'd heard a few songs but hadn't yet become a fan.  My friend had recently bought an equalizer for his car stereo and I recall him showing it off by playing Tom Sawyer. My first reaction was the song was silly.  It took about three listens before my opinion had reversed - it had gone from silly to magestic.  I had become a fan.  Thanks Mike!<br /><br />Rush created unique music.  Nothing else sounded the same.  At times magestic, at times complex, at times uneven and juvenile.  Moving pictures was the perfect hook on which to hang my teenage hat.<br /><br />Tom Sawyer is probably still the best of the lot.  Glorious, proud, awesome.  Red Barchetta - a great guitar experience.  YYZ took awhile for me to appreciate - which is a hallmark of much great music, i.e., not instantly approachable but once absorbed, can become something that you love the best.  The hammer-on guitar riff just prior to the synth bridge is a great moment in music. I still get goosebumps listening to it. Limelight is not my favorite, I can take it or leave it.<br /><br />Now flip the album over, or pull out the tape and flip it over.  Whatever works.  The Camera Eye - much more synth driven.  A lyrical melody and some great guitar music to follow.  A progrock epic.  Witch Hunt - one of the few times in music where the lyrics leapt through the music to grab me by the throat.  \\"Those who know what's best for us must rise and save us from ourselves.\\"  Striking words for an impressionable young mind.  A cautionary reminder to stand up for what is right. Vital Signs - similar to Limelight, this song never grabbed me.  Not bad, not awesome.<br /><br />For me, this album has many amazing moments and a few that are less so - which warrants the 4 out of 5.  I will happily listen to Moving Pictures any time - the album that turned me on to Rush.For me, this album has many amazing moments and a few that are less so - which warrants the 4 out of 5.

B00006ZXSK|4.0|Ever After is a wonderful twist on the entire Cinderella fairytale.  Drew Barrymore comes across as a strong willed Cinderella that knows what she wants out of life, which isn't what she currently has.  Prince Charming desperately needs her, otherwise, he's a weak kneed fool that bends to everyone else's wishes.  The battle of wills between the two is amusing and Barrymore shines, as she always does.
B001W63DX2|5.0|This video worths every cent. It´s very well done and shows the band, the backstage and the whole tour as we've never seen before. It's enjoyable even for those who are not diehard Maiden fans. Highly recommended.
B001C3KCSY|5.0|Kings of Leon Only by the Night is a rich and intense album displaying the full throaty qualiteies of the lead singer and the excellent acoustics of the fellow band members.  I was drawn irrestibly in by Sex on Fire and Use Somebody convinced me that this band was worth a second look.  Their lyrics are inspiring, soulful, heated and full of a vibrancy that radiates throughout the entire album.
B000TXNDUW|4.0|The Bottom Line:    Breathless reminds me of the Blair Witch Project (bet I'm the first person to ever say that) in that looking back it's hard to see what all the fuss was about--Breathless was extraordinarily novel for its time but now it's a far less compelling motion picture, so if you sit down to watch it you might find a find far less masterful than you were lead to believe.      3/4
B000YAA68C|5.0|Touching to the point that I began crying from the moment of the wake.  Subsequently, I cried through the entire movie.  These weren't tears of sadness, they were the tears where you sigh and think Gerry is the most wonderful man to have ever lived, determined that his love for his wife (Holly) could still be shouted from the rooftops even after he has left. Holly's pursuit of Gerry's requests to help her through her grief and depression are at times funny and poignant and the photography is absolutely stunning!
B00008NRI8|3.0|The Bottom Line:    It's a shame that Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock are wasting their talents here on a formulaic and cliched screenplay, for they generate a good amount of chemistry and humor in their interactions as a billionaire and lawyer forced together by loads of contrivance; I can't say that I didn't enjoy watching Two Weeks Notice, but it still saddens me that the film had the capacity to be something noteworthy and ended up as a mild diversion.    2.5/4
0307269981|5.0|\\"Godly people find life; evil people find death.\\" -- Proverbs 11:19<br /><br />If you enjoyed Lisbeth Salander in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, you're in for a treat: This is Lisbeth's story, explaining how such a brilliant woman came to be a ward of the state, taken \\"care of\\" by a pervert lawyer. What's more, she's on the run . . . first from her disappointment in loving Mikael Blomkvist, and later from the authorities who rely on circumstantial evidence to decide that she's a murderer. With all of Sweden after her, can Lisbeth outwit her foes?<br /><br />The story is very much a David and Goliath conflict: Tiny Lisbeth is pitted against rich, powerful, and evil enemies who wish her the very worst they can wish. In developing that theme, Stieg Larsson raises fascinating fundamental questions about duality in the reader's mind such as when strength is weakness and weakness is strength, when doing good leads to evil and when doing evil leads to doing good, when friendship is more important than love and love leads to friendship, what the basis for personal morality should be and when public morality is immoral, and how the family bonds can be horrible while friendship bonds can be redeeming. You'll walk away from this book with a more objective view of the next news story you read about a crime and its punishment.<br /><br />Stieg Larsson makes quite a bit of Lisbeth's extraordinary intellect. When she's running circles around conventional people, you'll feel like you are reading all about Robin Hood again. Those sections provide something of a letdown however for readers when they have to go back to following the conventional people as they bumble around. I found myself impatient for the next dose of Lisbeth several times in the book's middle.<br /><br />As in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, this book pulls off the respectable front of the rich and powerful to reveal the evil underneath, the sick predators who will stop at nothing to satisfy their every whim. Be ready to be dragged through the mud of gross human depravity. Like a modern-day Joan of Arc, Lisbeth doesn't let the muck stick to her as she slogs through it.<br /><br />Enjoy!!!!!!e mud of gross human depravity.

0545123267|5.0|Grace's friends and family have never truly understood her. They can't understand the feelings she has for the wolves that live in the woods behind her house, especially not the connection she has for one wolf in particular--her wolf.<br /><br />Her friends believe she is too caught up in the wolves behind her house and not enough in the people in her school. She just doesn't seem to understand that she should be associating with humans and not animals. What she doesn't know is that the wolves are human, at least for part of the year.<br /><br />When things start to go bad and the wolves seem to be in danger, Sam shows up and Grace immediately knows who he is. What she doesn't know is how it works and how long he will remain human, and with her.<br /><br />Can Grace and Sam find a way to be together, forever and always? Can the wolves find a way to let Sam go or will they try to stop his relationship, in any way they can?<br /><br />OMG, this is just an amazing book! One of the best books I have read in a while and I was just shocked at how much this book enthralled me. I couldn't put it down and now that it's over I just want more. It is just that kind of book.<br /><br />Shiver was just the perfect beginning to what I expect will be one of the best trilogies I will ever read. Sam and Grace were just such great, lovable characters. I am also more than willing to admit that I would love a Sam of my own. He just seems so sweet and perfect. I honestly can't think of one bad thing to say about Shiver. It made me laugh, cry, and hold my breath till I knew what would happen. The only thing I can't think that made me mad was that it ended and I have to wait a whole year for the next book.<br /><br />I am terribly sad to say that I have never read anything by Maggie Stiefvater before this but I am extremely happy to say that I plan on remedying that very soon. Shiver was an amazingly well-written book that I plan on re-reading many times over the years. I can't wait for the sequel, Linger and I plan on reading her other YA book, Lament, as soon as I can. If you haven't read anything by Maggie Stiefvater yet, what are you waiting for? Run, don't walk, to the nearest bookstore, library, or a friend's bookshelf until you find one of her books!YA book, Lament, as soon as I can.

B001993Y2C|3.0|I agree that the packaging on this boxset is bad, bad, bad!  Really disappointing.  The box looks cool, but it is designed very poorly.  There is no episode list... so you don't know what episode is on each disc!    And the holders for the individual discs are these bent cardboard pieces.  It's really lame.  Not easy to get the discs in and out of the set.  I am really thinking about buying seperate cases to hold the discs since the cardboard sleeves suck so much.  Universal should be ashamed.  Considering how expensive this set is... I expect the cases to hold and PROTECT the discs.  Even if the blu-ray discs have a protective coating... the case should not possibly cause scratches.    I love the show, and the picture and sound quality on these discs are great!   So in conslusion... I love the show, love what is on the discs, but hate the packaging.
0061231401|5.0|I was already a big fan of James Rollins books but I think this one is one of my favorites now.  Definitely enjoyed seeing Gray and the rest of the Sigma team back again.  It's still driving me crazy wondering who is the mole on their side that betrayed them.  The premise of a guy being so fanatical over world over population is so crazy that I could see someone wanting to do something drastic to try and stop it so it started off with a great story line.  I also loved hearing the history of the Domesday book, Merlin, the Egyptians, etc.  For fans of Seichan like me we get to see a lot of her again which is great and I am curious to see what is in store for her.  Action packed with just enough romance and tragedy thrown in to make this a great read.  It will keep you wanting to turn those pages and not be able to put it down until the very end.
B0000067L3|5.0|It was with a great deal of reluctance that I explored Cream's albums, seeing as I was never a huge fan of the songs that I did hear on commercial FM radio over here in Australia, plus the fact that only two of their songs ever get played here. The first album by Cream did nothing to overturn my prejudice against this. Their second album wasn't bad. \\"Wheels of fire\\" is a five star album in my view. It's highly polished album orientated blues rock, with an endearing \\"English-ness\\" about it...something that \\"Disraeli gears\\" lacked, I think, despite it being their most lauded album, appearing on the tv series \\"Classic albums\\". Of Cream's first three albums, it is \\"Wheels of fire\\" which is most worthy of giving rise to the \\"super-group\\" moniker which the band usually gets attached to it.       Anyway, here are my picks as the best songs on the album, plus the rest:    The best:    White room - this is one of the two Cream songs that you will hear on classic pop/rock stations in Australia. The other song is \\"Sunshine of your love\\". This track has good, subtle drumming and a distorted, sort of heavy metalish guitar sound, and there is a good lead guitar solo too. The riff sort of reminds me of Lynyrd Skynyrd's \\"Sweet home Alabama\\", which came after it.    Pressed rat and warthog - to me, this song seems to be a natural progression from the last track, I think, on Disraeli Gears, \\"Mother's lament\\". I really like this song for the same reason that I really like the opening track on The Sex Pistols' \\"The great rock'n'roll swindle\\" album, which features Malcolm McLaren doing a spoken word fairytale on how he invented punk music. In other words, both songs appeal on a childish level...listening to a soothing bedtime story read by someone with a soothing voice. Here the story is of the absurd kind, which the English are fond of-perhaps you could also characterise the lyrics as 'psychedelic'. The brass in this song is pretty, and some of the sounds/instruments are intriguing...perhaps the flute is included, and there is a certain mediaeval qquality to the sound, though the track does have a light rock accompaniment.     Those were the days - has fantasy lyrics, a theme that Led Zeppelin would mine in its later works. This is a pop/rock song with good drumming and is bassy too. Also has pretty bell sounds too...not unlike that found the opening theme to the US cartoon series \\"Futurama\\". Lyrics feature the word \\"Ocharina\\", which looking it up now means a musical instrument, but I associated it with a video game of a fantasy nature, but even if this is not a fantasy reference, the rest of the song does have that quality to it though...a longing for times past.    Deserted cities of the heart - has a deep bass and some of the guitar work reminds me of Stealers Wheel's \\"Stuck in the middle with you\\". Some of the vocal melody also reminds me of the song which features the lyrics \\"It's alright, well alright\\"...but I can't remember the song act/title...might even be a Cream song, in which case that might be three Cream songs you hear on Australian radio where I live! Good drumming in this song and a violin also features...maybe a cello too. There is a squealy lead guitar solo too.     As you said - another song featuring the cello or similar bassy instrument (double bass perhaps?). Has accoustic guitar and steel string accoustic guita by the sounds of it. A mellow song with sparkling guitar work and an Indian style accent.    Passing the time - a pretty, mellow track for bookends, which works well as a lullaby kind of song (The Red Hot Chili Pepper's song \\"Porcelain\\" is also a song that works well as a lullaby, but not as a pop/rock song). The middle part of this song is more hard rock, with slapping drums and a driving rhythm with the bass guitar. Also features a glassy percussion effect and the vocal melody sounds familiar...perhaps from the Sesame St childrens' tv show, for the song \\"Inchworm\\".     Born under a bad sign - the above songs have been slowly getting weaker, and this is the weakest song of the ones I like. The lyrics are fun...a blues song which gently mocks the genre. Cream sort of does to the Blues, what Monty Python did to those pub stories which start with \\"I was so poor that...\\". A deep bass sound with more squeaky, distorted lead guitar sounds featured. A good addition to the blues genre in any case.    The rest:    Politician - Cream get political on this song. It's a sleazy, bluesy, carnival type of song, with a cynical outlook towards those we elect. This song put to mind the story of \\"The Profumo Affair\\", which I had heard about when the movie \\"Scandal\\" was advertised some years back. Just looking up Wikipedia now, it does seem to have happened before this song was written, so perhaps 'inspiring' this song.  Features dual lead guitars and a bassy drum...double bass drum, perhaps?    Sitting on top of the world - a laid back, bluesy track with squeaky and distorted lead guitar and a noticeably bass sound.    CD 2 -       I'm giving the first cd five stars. The second cd is a different animal, and if you enjoy it, you will probably like their first album, which this cd expands on...to gargantuan proportions.  E.g. \\"Spoonful\\" and \\"Toad\\" are roughly tripled in length to over a quarter of an hour each. These four songs take up 44:22 minutes! If you like blues music by white guys, I think you will like this second cd. Personally, I drifted off for \\"Spoonful\\" on the two occasions that I listened to this song! It has an epic Moody Blues vibe to it. \\"Toad\\" didn't send me off to sleep, despite its similar length. If you are of the school of thought that says that the only thing better than a three minute drum solo is a 13 minute drum solo, then I think you are going to love \\"Toad\\"! Cream jams either side of Ginger Baker's gargantuan drum solo. In my notes for this song I state that I hear what sounds like Michael Jackson's \\"Beat it\\" guitar riff playing on the bass in this song (at aroundthe 0:55 mark). Also familiar sounding to me: at around 0:52 minutes into this song, the guitar plays something akin to The Stooges \\"I wanna be your dog\\" riff or whatnot. Anyway, the sound quality of the live 2nd cd is excellent.       \\"Wheels of fire\\" is not just a great Cream album, it's a great album full stop. I'm not convinced that \\"Disraeli Gears\\" is anywhere in this album's league. A marvelously English album.

0061245097|5.0|I so enjoyed this book,and have enjoyed the whole series. My complaint is about the cover. So I guess I am being picky. They have the model,on a Harley and in the story the bike that is ridden European. To a Biker that is a big difference.I own both a Harley and a Ducati two Triumphs and a BMW. The is a BIG difference between each bike. The bikes from Europe have a different attitude and are a bit sexier that the Harley. And remember Bones is a pretty sexy vamp.
B00260HH3K|1.0|This truly is a sad time for cinema. Oh well, when you can get a movie out of a freaking vending machine, the artistic integrity once involved in film making is thrown out the window. 2009 has been a terrible year for film.
B000HWZ5VU|5.0|Pictures At Eleven (1982) was Robert Plant's first solo album after the breakup of Led Zeppelin in 1980.  I personally think it's his best solo album, ranking just above Manic Nirvana.  This album contains eight good songs.  A lot of people say this album sounds a lot like what Led Zeppelin would have sounded like had they continued on after John Bonham died.  Or, they say it sounds a lot like Zeppelin's last studio album, In Through The Out Door (1979).  But no matter how you view it, it's a Robert Plant album that really has its own distinct identity.  While I agree to a certain extent on peoples' observations, there's a part of me that sees only certain elements of Led Zeppelin in this album.  The rest is Robert Plant, solo career.<br /><br />The album starts with \\"Burning Down One Side\\", a solid rock and roll song that is one of Plant's best songs of his entire solo career.  \\"Moonlight In Samosa\\" is mellow and melodic.  An excellent song.  \\"Pledge Pin\\" features drumming by Phil Collins and a saxophone.  \\"Slow Dancer\\" is a hard rock song with Plant sounding very much like he did when he was singing with Led Zeppelin.  This song has a lot of good changes and is a good mix of hard and mellow.  \\"Worse Than Detroit\\" is excellent, and there really is nothing worse than Detroit, as a matter of fact.  Horrible city.  Good beat and melody and a middle section with fantastic guitar work.  My favorite track on the album is \\"Fat Lip\\".  This is the signature song on the album, in my opinion.  Another song with good changes.  \\"Like I've Never Been Gone\\" is a slower song and one of the gems of the album.  The last song on the album to me is a filler song that probably went unnamed, hence the title \\"Mystery Title\\".  It sort of reminds me of Led Zeppelin IV, the untitled fourth album.  They couldn't think of a title for that one.  Instead, they used symbols representing each member of the band.<br /><br />All in all, this is an outstanding album.  This album kicked off Robert Plant's solo career in fine fashion.  Highly recommended.ant's solo career in fine fashion.  Highly recommended.

1400063736|5.0|Maybe you have to live in NY, and have been around for 9/11, but even if you don't or weren't, read this book! I am writing this through the tears that it has brought out from deep inside (many times througout). My wife and I moved to NY in January of 1974 from college, and were here for the pivotal event that binds these stories together. And we're here still, through all of the tough times this city has endured and continues to. I will NOT reveal any of the story, other than to say it is picture perfect in it's imagery, tone, and resolution. Read it and know what the human condition is all about. It is possibly one of the best books I have ever read, and I've read a lot. Writing this is not something I would normally do, but  have to. Spend the time and read it, you won't be able to stop. Believe me!
1589944607|5.0|Battlestar Galactica is the board game that put me firmly in the camp of the \\"board game gamer.\\"   When I got this game for myself last Xmas, I was daunted by the long rulebook and the many cards, parts and pieces. It all seemed like too much effort...crisis cards...super crisis cards...Raiders...Heavy Raiders...etcetera. There are many small ships to keep track of and many cardboard pieces which don't always hold up so well after multiple games.   But don't let that stop you. This game is worth the effort.  Since I am a big fan of the \\"Battlestar Galactica\\" TV show, I didn't give up on the game and I played the it at a local gaming convention. And I had a blast!  The Battlestar Galactica board game is complex and time consuming and deals with some adult themes, so I wouldn't recommend it for kids (especially those with short attention spans).  The goal of the game is for the Human fleet to reach the planet Kobol by making FTL (faster than light) \\"jumps\\" through hazardous territory. The Cylons want to prevent this from happening by destroying the Battlestar Galactica or running the Humans out of their four main resources (food, fuel, morale and population) through military attacks and exploiting the mandatory crisis posed to the fleet each turn.  Yes, you'll need at least three hours (give or take) for a game of BSG, but the time spent is worth it, if you ask me.  Yes, making the switch to this kind of complex, adult oriented game isn't easy at first for people who play Parker Brothers board games regularly.  Yes, you will have more fun playing BSG with three or more people. But there are two player and solo rules on the game's web site. I've had fun playing by myself, which (to me) is the sign of a good board game.  Yes, you may get the chance to play as a Cylon and attempt to destroy humanity. Any character being played can be a Cylon, not just the ones who turned out to be such in the TV show. The element of paranoia between the players is a significant element of the game--one which increases with the number of players in the game.  No, everything in the game does not follow the logic set down by the TV show. For example, no character can fly Raptors in the game (Raptors are risked in various card based situations, they don't enter into combat), not even Boomer and Helo who are characters in the TV show who only fly Raptors.  No, it's not easy to be the Humans once a Cylon player is revealed. But that's the point. Human players have to work together to find out which player is a hidden Cylon--while resolving a new crisis every turn, plus Cylon fleet attacks--and then work even harder to fight off the revealed Cylon's determined efforts to destroy humanity.  Yes, each of the main Human (and one Cylon) characters from the first season of the TV show is represented in the game. My favorites are Baltar and Tigh, though Adama and Roslin are great in larger games. And the allure of jumping into a Viper and blasting Cylon Raiders as Apollo or Starbuck is strong.  Yes, Fantasy Flight Games is due to release the Pegasus expansion (in Fall 2009) to the Battlestar Galactica board game, which carries the game through the beginning of season 3 of the TV series.  Whether you like the TV show or hate it, I hope you try and enjoy the Battlestar Galactica board game if what I've written above sounds at all interesting to you.

1595141979|5.0|Gold Star Award Winner!<br /><br />Thank you, Richelle Mead!  You have given fans of the VAMPIRE ACADEMY series a wonderful third novel.  SHADOW KISS is probably the best out of the three.  Reading VAMPIRE ACADEMY and FROSTBITE first is a must in order to really understand what is going on in the series.<br /><br />Rose Hathaway is training to be a Guardian.  Once she graduates from St. Vladimir's Academy, she will be assigned to guard her best friend, Lissa, for the rest of her life.  Even though everything is going along as planned, she feels waves of jealously and anger.  A lot of these feelings come from the fact that she can never have what she truly wants - love.<br /><br />Dimitri, her mentor and teacher, is set to be her partner after graduation. He and Rose will be the team that guards Lissa on a daily basis.  The problem is, Rose and Dimitri are in love.  Knowing their love isn't allowed, they make sure to keep their relationship professional - when they can.<br /><br />Rose has started seeing ghosts and she feels sure they are trying to tell her something.  Soon she begins to understand they are telling her that danger is on the way.  Danger that will involve everyone at St. Vladimir's.  Rose is no stranger to fighting, but this time it is going to be war.<br /><br />Not everyone survives, and Rose ends up having to make the hardest decision of her life - one that will effect both her and Lissa.<br /><br />SHADOW KISS left me breathless and in tears.  I can't wait for the next book in the series to come out.  The way the story ends leads me to believe that the next book will be even better.  There are so many possibilities that it makes my head spin.<br /><br />Reviewed by:  Karin Librarian

I mean Mariah would release a single that I liked, but nothing that would get me to purchase a cd. This is totaly different. I'm saying the lyrics,the music, and the collaborations, everything about this cd says good work. This is just a all round great cd. This is comming from someone who is not a fan of Mariah Carey. That is saying a lot!!!!
B00168HARG|5.0|If you were disappointed with Terminator Salvation cause of the non-existing plot. You should give this series a go. The characters have much more depth and the stories are interesting.      I have only one problem with the Blu-ray set. You cannot have sub-title on when you're watching an episode on the commentary track. So unless you have good memory of the episode, you may lose track on some of the comments as they reference things that was happening on screen at the time.
B0013FSL0C|4.0|I'm not one of those people who have the patience to watch something good week-by-week on TV. When something is as gripping as \\"In Treatment\\" I have to have all of a good thing. I devoured all 20 or so hours of Series 1 in two days - it's that good! After a slower than expected start, the characters very quickly began to reveal aspects of themselves which built and built, forming incredibly complex people and interpersonal situations. I liked all of the characters but found myself looking forward to each new instalment of Sophie, the teenager with a 30 year old head on her shoulders and a venomous tongue born of painful emotional baggage. I found the scenes featuring Sophie and her Mum hard to watch but I believed totally all that I was seeing. My only issue with the writers is that while they go to the trouble of explaining and demonstrating \\"transferrence\\", I think the protagonist, Paul - a highly skilled psychotherapist - demonstrates \\"counter transferrence\\" without much insight into his own practice and feelings, particularly with Sophie and to a lesser extent, Alex. As  I heard one reviewer say \\"while it's brilliant television, it's not particularly brilliant psychotherapy\\"...but it is brilliant viewing. I'm licking my lips in anticipation of Series 2.
0385342020|4.0|The book is cute, and funny, and escapist. Is it realistic? Not at all. The main character, Lara Lington spends the entire book talking to her dead aunt, Sadie. Sadie has come back from the dead to find a necklace she lost and it's up to Lara to help her. Lara and Sadie (who died at 105 but comes back as a young woman from the 20s) have a rocky relationship at the start but begin to warm up to one another as the book progresses. As Lara helps Sadie look for her necklace she unravels an even deeper mystery involving her aunt and her aunt's past. Sadie and Lara have a developing relationship and talk to each other about their lives and troubles. The part that makes the book completely unrealistic is that Sadie remains a ghost and isn't explained away as a figment of Lara's imagination or psyche. We are to believe Lara and Sadie's ghost actually interact and converse throughout the book, and that Sadie's actions towards others happened. While Lara looks for Sadie's necklace she has some personal issues along the way - boyfriend, job, friendship - that need tending and Sadie is there to help her. There is humor and a great resolution to the story. I'm actually a fan of Kinsella's non-shopaholic books and would say this is definitely a book worth reading.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|True Blood is quite like Twilight for adults, but more serious with nudity, violence, profanity, humor, etc and it has a better story.<br /><br />The first two episodes didn't do much for me, but as I kept watching more and more, I couldn't stop. I've become somewhat obsessed with the show.<br /><br />I totally recommend it to anyone that has a fascination with vampires and doesn't mind sex and violence. Also the opening title is great - Digital Kitchen (design firm)!<br /><br />The plot keeps getting more interesting and twisted as the show progresses. HBO shows are the best!

B001KVZ6F2|3.0|Before this movie devolved into clichés and predictability, I really was enjoying the tale of a retired, archaic war vet trying to hold onto lifestyle and time period. It was really a great study into assimilation. Mind you this is all before Toad, i forget his actual name, said passionately? his first awkward line, \\"Excuse me Sir, I need a haircut if you ain't too busy you old Italian son of a bitch prick barber. Boy, does my ass hurt from all of the guys at my construction job.\\"     The movie never recovered, in fact, it got worse. I don't usually pay attention to acting in movies so when it manages to distract me from the movie's other elements, it must be pretty bad. The actress who plays Sue, while attempting to be intentionally funny, just manages to annoy the heck out of me. As the movie chugs along, albeit uncomfortably, Toad steals more of the spotlight. Maybe the director has some twisted sense of humor. An actor who steps out of character AFTER EVERY UTTERANCE should not hog the camera but should be hidden from it. After his every belch of \\"LET ME AOOOUUUT WALT, LET ME AOOOUUT NOW\\", he looks awkwardly around the room as though he's saying \\"that was good guys right? eh? eh?\\", proceeding to say \\"WALT LET ME AOOOOUUTT!\\".     Thank god this movie had its share of memorable quotes +1 star.

1579126227|5.0|The Mysterious Affair at Styles was not only the first Hercule Poirot book, but also the first book of Agatha Christie's career.  Poirot arrives as a a refugee fleeing from the overthrow of his country during World War I.  Doing so he arrives at Styles manor where he meets up with a few people he has met and would become a great part of his career in books, Arthur Hastings and Inspector Japp.  While the story relies as much on method as motive and psychology (later psychology would play a larger part in solving a murder than clues...the Sherlock Holmes approach), it is still an excellent read.  For any Poirot fans or those that think they may like mysteries, the Mysterious Affair at Styles is one for the bookshelf.  As far as the book itself goes, the print is larger than some paperback editions and the pages are larger, making it easier to hold with one hand or set down on a table.  It doesn't take as much effort to keep it completely open for reading near the spine.

9562911640|1.0|This 116 page version from BN Publishing is NOT the complete Master Key System. It is an abridged version and is not worth buying. I went to the library and checked out the \\"real\\" book, which is more like 400+ pages. This book is barley 110 (plus 6 pages of ads in the back!). Look at the page count before ordering. Maybe I'm missing something, but there really should be a big, bold warning that this version is totally abridged.  I've never seen a book so different from the original.<br /><br />It is ridiculously short, has no flow in the text (basically there are numbered paragraphs) and absolutely not the same as the original text. I don't really understand, actually, why it got published with the same name or why the reviews on here are so wonderful. I'm thinking maybe amazon uses the same reviews for all versions? Anyway, be sure to look at the page count before ordering and don't buy this one.

B000CPH9I4|5.0|So with the very first Corrs album I bought, I was impressed by their Irish folksy sound on many tracks, and to this day, \\"Erin Shore\\" remains my favorite instrumental number of all time.  Since that time, I have longed for some more \\"inspired\\" arrangements of traditional Irish songs, and who better to present it than the group that got me into it in the first place.  To be honest, some of their albums in the past have let me down a little, but I've always enjoyed their sound, so I didn't really know what to expect with this one, but now, I have to say, if I ever want to transport myself to the green hills of Ireland, I just need to give this album a listen.  I still find myself toe-tapping and singing along, and sometimes I even forget I'm singing traditional Irish tunes, but either way, I love it.  There are some slower songs, and perhaps some that won't stick with me as much as others, just like any album, but I've also found those that stick with me days after listening, and I find myself humming in the morning when I wake up without even realizing it.
B000LAZDQA|3.0|For those of you (and there may be some) concerned that, in a post-HIV world the Underground has diminished into historical insignificance, SHORTBUS serves notice the Counterculture is still here, and is eccentric as ever.  Shortbus is the name of a New York underground sex club, where uninhibited, hedonistic patrons flock for group sex, indie music, and ostentatious camaraderie.  No, it's not an establishment to host a church social, but it is a place where those who wish to think outside the box gather to learn more about themselves.<br /><br />The varied regulars of Shortbus include a gay couple, a sex therapist, and a dominatrix; these characters spin the interdependent story threads of the film.  Although there's some quirky humor to be found in several scenes and in all of the characters, there is also a dark undertow--an almost pessimistic searching of self, of discovering shortcomings and ultimate disappointments.  Which is why SHORTBUS is almost too clever for its own good, and why the film is decidedly uneven.  Case in point:  the gay plot thread was overly corny and melodramatic, not fully vetted or resolved, with one of the characters repeatedly bursting into tears light years beyond the patience of this reviewer.<br /><br />That said, there are some distinct positives about SHORTBUS.  All of the acting was very good, particularly Sook-Yin Lee (who I learned from the special features is a CBC broadcaster), playing a sex therapist who, irony of ironies, is in search of that elusive first orgasm.  The majority of character interaction was improvised, and improvised convincingly.  I like diverse characters, so here's a film that satisfies that requirement in spades.<br /><br />Oh yeah.  There's also this matter of sex.  I won't sugarcoat it:  This is a graphic film using human sexuality as its driving metaphor.  There is gay sex, there is straight sex, there is group sex, there are deviations thereof; so if any (or all) of the above offend thee, do not watch SHORTBUS.  As director John Cameron Mitchell explains via the special features (which I heartily recommend), the graphic sex to begin the movie serves the purpose to \\"burst the audience's hymen\\"--a prurient hook, so to speak.  The intensity of the sex is subsequently diminished as the film moves along.<br /><br />The commentary featuring Mitchell and several of the actors is very informative and revealing--especially when it comes to the particulars surrounding the final camera shot of the film.  So there were things I liked and enjoyed about SHORTBUS, and things I didn't enjoy nor care for about SHORTBUS.  One thing for sure (well, maybe two):  Watching it is a definite unique experience; and the Underground is still out there.<br />--D.

B0000252YK|4.0|Nearly three years after Bark At The Moon Ozzy returned with The Ultimate Sin. Since the last album things have changed, it is now 1986 and hair metal now dominates. Ozzy followed the current and released a hair metal album. This album helped him reach some commercial success (Shot In The Dark). The Ultimate Sin was quite different from his three previous albums and is pretty strong for the time it was released considering most bands were playing poppy songs and were doing anything to get a hit. It's certainly not his best album I'll tell you right now, and Ozzy himself hates the album, but is it really that bad?<br /><br />  It's Ozzy so of course it's a little heavier than your average hair metal band. I think the title track is a good example of that. The title track is a classic and doesn't give any sign about this album being a hair metal one. It is truly one of Ozzy's classics and I think most fans will agree with me on that one, the beginning's heavy drums with that crunchy guitar riff is memorable. The next song Secret Looser is another heavy track that's catchy and in some ways reflects all of us, one of the best songs on the album. Never Know Why sounds more like hair metal than the previous two songs, different I quite like it. Thank God for the Bomb on the other hand is my least favourite song and I just don't get it. Never is much better and the chorus is great, not great but a good song.<br /><br />  Lightning Strikes is a good song and get you in, another great song. Up next is what I can describe as perhaps my favourite Ozzy song ever; Killer of Giants. The song is much talked about and it just has to be heard to know what fans are talking about. It starts slowly with some great guitar work by Lee and just gets better from there. It's an epic song with fantastic guitar work and Ozzy delivers an inspiring performance singing this song. Fool Like You is a great song I can't say much more, it's a great song. Shot In The Dark is another classic and unfortunately it's the only song Ozzy acknowledges from The Ultimate Sin (he prefers the live version from \\"Just Say Ozzy\\"). It was a huge hit in the 80s and is one of his best songs.<br /><br />  The Ultimate Sin would be the last album with guitarist Jake E. Lee, Lee did a very good job at replacing Randy Rhoads and proved on his work with Ozzy to be a very good and creative guitar player. The album is clearly a hair metal album but it's good at what it is and rocks. I believe it is an underrated album as besides Shot In The Dark, Ozzy refuses to acknowledge the album. In fact it didn't even get a remaster, it was just ignored. It has some classic songs and is worth listening. It's just too bad that the album is so underrated and sometimes skipped when you look at Ozzy's career. I give it four stars.ately it's the only song Ozzy acknowledges from The Ultimate Sin (he prefers the live version from \\"Just Say Ozzy\\").

B0028K31CE|5.0|This was the most anticipated albulm of the year, and without a doubt it did not disappoint. I am a HUGE fan of music of all genres, but by far this is my favorite this year. The songs are extremely inspiring and one song in particular touched my soul - Bad Habits. Bad Habits (to me) is about loving someone, but loving yourself more. Breaking a bad habit - be it a person, smoking, tanning, etc - is hard to do. This song exemplifies everything that everyone else couldn't. I rate this albulm a CLASSIC! Long awaited and timeless!

0316017922|4.0|Outliers is one of those books that just seems so obvious when you're reading it, but forces you to appreciate the mind that can think of the things that no one else does.    In Outliers, Malcolm Gladwell eschews the notion of intelligence or ambition as causes of success.  Instead he argues that other factors, factors not determined by the individual, are the primary causes.  Factors, such as race, culture, and just pure luck have a much more profound impact on it.  And he proves this with a string of compelling stories of success, and in some cases, failure.  Gladwell shows us why Canadian hockey players are born in the first few months of the year, and it's not all about talent.  He shows us why Asians do better than other races in math, and even why Korean Airlines have historically had more plane crashes than other airlines.    All of the stories are engaging and interesting.  And a number of them do present practical applications. For example, the lessons of Chinese students, and even studies done here in America that show lower income children lose their learning over the course of summer vacation, points to longer school years to improve academic success.  The lessons of Korean airline crashes show cultural factors can be mitigated to improve cockpit communication, and thus cut down on airline crashes.  But the practical applications seemed to be limited to groups of outliers, rather than individuals.  The stories of Bill Gates, Bill Joy, and the Beatles, filled with early and lucky opportunities, seemed to say to me that these people were lucky and I was not so I'm destined to be average.    Even the now famous '10,000 hour rule' which states that one needs to work hard at something for at least 10,000 hours to become an expert, seems to require an early identification of a talent and parents wise enough to push their child to work hard enough to get those hours in.  That stands opposed to the current thinking that there are `second acts' in life.  Or rather, it suggests that while there may be second acts, rarely will they result in outliers.   So you can quit your day job to become a photographer, or to learn to play cello, but unless you started young, you'll never have the time to perfect the art, to be Ansel Adams or Yo Yo Ma.  While we seem to know this intuitively, it's a tad hurtful to have it proven to you.     This is a fun book to read, and thought-provoking.  But don't expect it to give you the key to success.
B002GJU54E|3.0|Am a fan of Evanovich but was disappointed in Plum Spooky.  Too much copy  re inhuman actions.  People who put their hands on you and you're   immediately tatooed...other such bizarre incidents and impossible acts  of unlocking doors by just touching them...a fart that sets fire to a  house...    no thanks.
0345495004|4.0|This book immediately drew me because of its association with the famous architect, Frank Lloyd Wright, along with another novel by TC Boyle entitled The Women.   But while Boyle's book covers all of the women in Wright's life, Horan's focuses on arguably the most intriguing, and certainly the most infamous.    Loving Frank is about the controversial affair Wright had with Mamah Borthwick Cheney, the wife of one of Wright's Oak Park clients.  The affair starts with the typical emotional commiserations and secret trysts.  But soon the affair escalates when the lovers flee their families to Europe.  They eventually return to the Wisconsin love nest that would become forever known as Taliesin, and then, as anyone familiar with Wright's history knows, run smack into tragedy.  The story is told from Mamah's perspective- Wright is a supporting actor until the very end - thus we are witness to her inner emotions and the motivations that compel her to leave her husband and children for this man.  Indeed, as the title betrays, the novel portrays her love for Wright and the consequences of that love.  This is historical fact.  But why does she love him?     This also isn't too difficult to figure out once we know just a tiny sliver of Mamah.  She's an intellectual woman at a time when women were mostly relegated to running households and rearing children.  In fact, as the story begins, that's exactly what she's doing, despite her intellectual pedigree and feminist bent.  Thus her meeting of Wright, a rising and brilliant architect with a hunger to not just make buildings but to blow up and rebuild the art form, seems to have been pre-ordained to turn into a love affair.  As we watch the relationship unfold, we root for her because we can almost feel the pull of it ourselves.  Today such a life re-boot is common, so seems reasonable enough to our modern sensibilities, though we are reminded how controversial this sort of thing was in those days by the press onslaught, as wellas the withdrawal of some of Mamah's closest confidants.  But it's not her falling in love with Frank that makes her an intriguing character.  Nor is it the irresistible urge to re-make herself through the strength and encouragement of their intellectual camaraderie.  It's the abandonment of her two small children, John and Martha, that throws doubt into our minds.  We are running along with her, having a great time, not thinking about the children very much, as she isn't, until she starts to recognize the consequences for them, and that's when things become real interesting.  It's then, when she's too far gone to change what she's done and has to figure out what her new life will be that the story can fully breathe.      Horan's writing is strong and her storytelling competent.  She always seems to hit the right notes at the right times and ably pulls us along for the ride.  Mamah is a great, complicated character.  Horan's portrayal of Wright seems a little buffoonish at times; at others he seems too level-headed and kind.  But what bleeds through is enough to make us wonder whether or not he's worthy of Mamah's sacrifices.  And Horan rounds him out wonderfully when the viewpoint shifts to his at the end.  The only minor criticism I have is the light lead-up to the tragedy, though perhaps that was intentional to portray the random and cruel nature of the event.  Overall, this is a worthy read, especially for anyone interested in Wright, or in the art of living.
B002DKGWSE|3.0|Having never seen the original, I came into this film with only a vague knowledge of the story.  I know the original is considered a classic, and I really like the up and coming actor Garret Dillahunt, so I gave this one a whirl.  While not directed by Wes ( which to me is a detraction) it is produced by him...and the influence a little evident in the film.  This film is a rape revenge film, not to dissimilar to all of the exploitation flicks of the 70s with the same subject matter, big difference being the budget.  The film is being marketed as a Horror..but is not a horror in the modern sense of the idea of \\"horror flick\\", it is only a horror as the content is brutal, and many times horrifying...I bet if Terror where a film category this film would more comfortably fit in it.  There are several scenes in this film that are not for the faint of heart, and while other reviewers have panned it as being to graphic...it is not as graphic as other cult classic rape/revenge flicks such as \\"I spit on your grave\\", or the more modern torture flick \\"The Girl Next Door\\" in fact there is very little nudity save for the obligatory boob shots.  That is not to say that this movie doesn't have some very disturbing scenes, and may not be suitable for everyone...cuz it does, and it ain't.  Over all the actors carried the day with this one, great acting all around...and an interesting..and somewhat different approach to ideas on social degeneration.  Not gunna change the world..but also ..not the end of it..if you like gore ..or horror/thrillers..check it out.
1439138311|4.0|Brooklyn is the story of Eilis Lacey, a young Irish girl who moves to Brooklyn in the early 1950's to start a new life in America.  She seems to fit right in by working a job at a clothing store to make a living, taking college courses in bookkeeping to advance further into the company, and falling in love with an Italian-American named Tony.  Yet throughout the majority of the book, Eilis seems to struggle with the disconnectedness that is natural for a person in her shoes.  She spends much time miserable and homesick.  She is successful at work, but wears a mask to do so.  When she has an attack of homesickness that causes her to drop her mask for just one moment, she's sent home and warned not to let it happen again.  She has trouble keeping up with the intrigue between all the other young girls she shares a house with, never quite sure knowing who to trust, including the landlord, Mrs. Kehoe.  She only finds solace in her courses, probably because it's what she's good at and because it was the subject she studied in Ireland, and in the company of Tony.  But even with him, she seems ambivalent, unsure of what is happening to her, unsure of her true feelings.    When after two years tragedy draws her back home for a month-long visit, she finds some comfort, but things are different, both from her perspective and those around her.  America has changed her and people notice.  And these differences allow her the opportunity to start again in Ireland, with perhaps a better life than she could have imagined at any time before.  It is now that she reaches her emotional crossroad and the book is able to resolve, which it does beautifully, like a good symphony.  Up until then, all had been decided for Eilis, from the trip to Brooklyn itself, to the job she had, where she would live.  Even Tony forced her deeper into their relationship than she seemed ready for.  But now, with yet another direction thrust upon her, stuck all by herself between two worlds, she is required to choose for herself.               Brooklyn is told in a dry, almost clinical fashion.  Yet the prose is razor-sharp and draws the reader along sure-footedly.  I am often a sloppy reader, yet I found myself unwilling to waste a single word.  Toibin continues to demonstrate his remarkable capability to drive deep into the emotions of his characters, something he also showed quite remarkably in The Master, and Mothers and Sons.  He's quickly becoming one of my favorite contemporary authors.
B001IYCMNA|4.0|Having been fed up with the problems I've had with building my own and buying various AP's, I decided to spend a little bit more and try this one.  It's been fairly dependable.  I use the \\"fairly\\" qualifier, because I have had a an issue or two, but I can't be sure it wasn't a neighbor setting up a new AP on the same channel, or something like that.  Otherwise it's been solid in nearly a year of service.  I really appreciate that it supports IPv6 out of the box, even in the management interface.  It's got a lot more control than a regular consumer AP with things like vlan support and pretending to be multiple AP's with different SSID's, etc.  One other thing is that it's more and more difficult to find a decent AP only wireless AP.  At the consumer level, they all seem to be wireless routers now.  I already have a firewall and only wanted an AP.  This fits the bill nicely.  One other feature I'm not using now, but may later is PoE.
B002DKF47O|5.0|I like Evangelion more than I like The Apostasy. This album is different from The Apostasy. I think Evangelion is better than The Apostasy. Behemoth really stepped it up on Evangelion. Behemoth has been around for a long time now. I think you'll like this album if you like death metal, and black metal. This is an album to have this year.<br />My favorite songs on Evangelion are:<br />1. Ov Fire and the Void<br />2. Transmigrating Beyond Realms ov Amenti<br />3. He Who Breeds Pestilence<br />4. The Seed ov I<br />5. Alas, Lord Is Upon Me

B000NXVS96|2.0|I began reading this book as a result seeing the BBC's recommendation of the top 100 books.  When seeing other books on the list, such as Tale of Two Cities and To Kill A Mockingbird, I was expecting great things.   The book was amusing, yet I was disappointed in the morality level.  This is not a book which should be on such a list of excellent literature.  More like chick-lit, light, and all for fun reading.
B001KMB6X2|3.0|Simple premise: drop Vin Diesel into some collapsing world of the future, give him A Quest with A Fair Maiden, arrange for plenty of guns, and stand back. Having Charlotte Rampling there for some sneering just makes it better.<br /><br />The tech-grunge look of that imagined world comes across very effectively. One fight scene in a dogtown warren full of scaffolding is among the best-choreographed I've seen. The Fair Maiden is cute, but this is a guns'n'chases flick, so chastity rules. And the ending simply defies all logic. It's touching, but don't - just don't try to figure out why that payload incurs the price it does. That part just doesn't make any sense.<br /><br />But, if anyone wanted a movie that made sense, they wouldn't have given Diesel a gun. Cool shoot-em-up action prevails, and that's all this movie was really about. Oh, and Michelle Yeoh showing some cool moves.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
B00284BMBM|5.0|I bought this CD the day it came out and I wanted to wait about a month before reviewing it so I would be familiar with the songs.  In my experience, even great songs take a few listens before they become really enjoyable.  Anyway, there are about 6 great songs, 3 good songs, and 3 mediocre songs.  The sound is quite different from the first album, but it's a good \\"different.\\"  Happy listening.
B002E2QHBS|4.0|This is an incredible set!  The best Woodstock collection yet!  The sound quality is stellar.  The packaging?  Fantastic!  Similar to Rhino's \\"Love Is The Song We Sing: San Francisco Nuggets 1965-1970\\" but with the CD's in plastic DVD length cases, so no worry about scratching your CD's.  I would like to give this set four and A HALF stars, just shy of five.  Why only four and a half and not five?  Well, first off, it can't be helped that Keef Hartley Band, Ten Years After, and The Band backed out of being a part of this collection.  I'm sure Rhino tried all they could, but what can you do?  What I'm at a loss about is the repeated inclusion of CSN&Y's non-Woodstock performance of \\"Sea Of Madness.\\"  It's been established that this performance was at the Fillmore East a week later from the festival.  Why couldn't \\"Blackbird,\\" \\"Mr. Soul,\\" or \\"Helplessly Hoping\\" been included instead?  Anyways, the included booklet is awesome featuring the COMPLETE listing of Woodstock performers and their complete sets for the first time!  FINALLY!  This set is 6-CDs long so are you ready for this?  Here we go.<br /><br />DISC ONE:<br /><br />1.  RITCHIE HAVENS:  The remix makes his performance sound much more intimate and close.<br />2.  SWEETWATER:  Better than expected!  \\"Look Out\\" ROCKS and \\"Two Worlds\\" is faster than the studio version.<br />3.  BERT SOMMER:  To have left this guy off for 40 years is criminal!  A BEAUTIFUL, inspired sounding acoustic set.  What a voice!<br />4.  TIM HARDIN:  Tim is all his disheveled glory. \\"Simple Song Of Freedom\\" will make you smile and cry at the same time.<br />5.  RAVI SHANKAR:  I've heard better from Ravi (Monterey, etc.), but this rather short raga is good.<br />6.  MELANIE:  A POWERFUL three songs from the raspy voiced singing/songwriting princess of the early '70s.<br />7.  ARLO GUTHRIE:  Well now we know why his Woodstock performance of \\"Coming Into Los Angeles\\" was replaced on the soundtrack, Arlo's mic was off for the first verse of the song!<br /><br />DISC TWO:<br /><br />1.  JOAN BAEZ:  Aside from the inclusion of \\"Hickory Wind\\" this is pretty much the same as you've always known from Joan.<br />2.  QUILL:  IT'S ABOUT TIME THIS BAND GOT SOME RECOGNITION!  A percussion based psychedelic rock band that were REALLY theatrical!<br />3.  COUNTRY JOE MCDONALD:  Did you know he came back for another verse of \\"Fixin' To Die\\" after his shouted \\"ALRIGHT!\\"  Me neither.<br />4.  SANTANA:  A killer \\"Persuasion\\" and an unedited \\"Soul Sacrifice.\\"<br />5.  JOHN B. SEBASTIAN:  Yep, John was stoned.  His stage patter is finally in the correct places after all these years.<br />6.  INCREDIBLE STRING BAND:  Very hippie, very acoustic, very folk, very good.<br /><br />DISC THREE:<br /><br />1.  CANNED HEAT:  The Bear has to pee before \\"Going Up The Country\\" and \\"Woodstock Boogie\\" KILLS...ALL 28 MINUTES OF IT!<br />2.  MOUNTAIN:  A better \\"Blood Of The Sun\\" than on \\"Woodstock Two.\\"  And a great \\"For Yasgur's Farm\\" with Leslie belting it!<br />3.  GRATEFUL DEAD:  A 19-minute \\"Dark Star\\" that's not all that bad despite being from one of The Dead's worst performances.<br />4.  CCR:  Creedence was TIGHT after following The Dead.  \\"Green River,\\" \\"Bad Moon Rising,\\" and \\"I Put A Spell On You\\" are all KILLER! The inclusion of \\"Keep On Chooglin\\" would have been nice though.<br /><br />DISC FOUR:<br /><br />1.  JANIS JOPLIN:  A better mix than the 25th Anniversary set!  Janis wasn't in her best form but she got the point across.<br />2.  SLY & THE FAMILY STONE:  The UNEDITED medley that almost brought the stage down early that Sunday morning.  100% PURE FUNK!<br />3.  ABBIE HOFFMAN:  \\"John Sinclair...John Sinclair...blah...blah...blah\\"<br />4.  THE WHO:  INSANE, ghostly feedback from Pete's amp for \\"Amazing Journey.\\"  And Abbie and Pete duet.  Ha ha ha.<br />5.  JEFFERSON AIRPLANE:  Morning maniac music.  The Airplane rocked Sunday morning with the opening \\"The Other Side Of This Life.\\"<br /><br />DISC FIVE:<br /><br />1.JOE COCKER:  No \\"Something's Coming On\\" but Joe and the band sound FANTASTIC with this remix.  Funny backing vocals as always.<br />2.  THE RAINSTORM:  Got everyone's attention after Joe but never got a record deal.  Very soothing...for 4 minutes.<br />3.  COUNTRY JOE & THE FISH:  A ROCKING set from The Fish!  A \\"reprise\\" version of \\"Rock And Soul Music\\" that lasts 12 minutes.<br />4.  JOHNNY WINTER:  The full \\"Mean Town Blues\\" which features some KILLER slide work from Johnny.<br />5.  BLOOD, SWEAT, & TEARS:  Their last song, \\"You've Made Me So Very Happy,\\" and they sound really good here.  Good horn section!<br /><br />DISC SIX:<br /><br />1/2.  CSN&Y:  They were alright.  \\"Marrakesh Express\\" is the best of THIS set, but no \\"Blackbird\\" which WAS their best that night.<br />3.  BUTTERFIELD BLUES BAND:  \\"No Amount Of Loving\\" is plagued by a faulty mic but this thing grooves so good it makes up for it.<br />4.  SHA NA NA:  Would have like to have heard \\"Teen Angel\\" as well.  \\"Get A Job\\" was their opener.  Face it, these guys ruled.<br />5.  JIMI HENDRIX:  The same as you've heard but it doesn't sound remixed for the box set.<br /><br />Well there you go, all six discs.  Not only does the music sound better than it has ever sounded before but the stage announcements  included are great as well.  I guess they read my review for the 25th Anniversary box set.  You're going to hear some pretty funny announcements that were not included on the original soundtrack.  Come to find out the brown acid warning was at night after Canned Heat's set and that wasn't the only problem, both John Morris and Chip Monck were CONSTANTLY having to tell festival goers to get off of the towers!  There's even some advice on taking the green acid tabs from none other than the San Francisco acid team themselves, Jerry Garcia and Country Joe!  And most importantly, the full unedited speech from Mr. Max Yasgur.  God Bless your memory Max.  By opening your heart, you made history.THE RAINSTORM:  Got everyone's attention after Joe but never got a record deal.  Very soothing...for 4 minutes.  3.  COUNTRY JOE & THE FISH:  A ROCKING set from The Fish!  A \\"reprise\\" version of \\"Rock And Soul Music\\" that lasts 12 minutes.   4.  JOHNNY WINTER:  The full \\"Mean Town Blues\\" which features some KILLER slide work from Johnny.    5.  BLOOD, SWEAT, & TEARS:  Their last song, \\"You've Made Me So Very Happy,\\" and they sound really good here.  Good horn section!      DISC SIX:    1/2.  CSN&Y:  They were alright.  \\"Marrakesh Express\\" is the best of THIS set, but no \\"Blackbird\\" which WAS their best that night.    3.  BUTTERFIELD BLUES BAND:  \\"No Amount Of Loving\\" is plagued by a faulty mic but this thing grooves so good it makes up for it.    4.  SHA NA NA:  Would have like to have heard \\"Teen Angel\\" as well.  \\"Get A Job\\" was their opener.  Face it, these guys ruled.   5.  JIMI HENDRIX:  The same as you've heard but it doesn't sound remixed for the box set.       Well there you go, all six discs.  Not only does the music sound better than it has ever sounded before but the stage announcements  included are great as well.  I guess they read my review for the 25th Anniversary box set.  You're going to hear some pretty funny announcements that were not included on the original soundtrack.  Come to find out the brown acid warning was at night after Canned Heat's set and that wasn't the only problem, both John Morris and Chip Monck were CONSTANTLY having to tell festival goers to get off of the towers!  There's even some advice on taking the green acid tabs from none other than the San Francisco acid team themselves, Jerry Garcia and Country Joe!  And most importantly, the full unedited speech from Mr. Max Yasgur.  God Bless your memory Max.  By opening your heart, you made history.
B000Z6MIQS|5.0|You will have to put your preconceptions aside before listening to this album as this is a dramatic change in direction compared to their past albums. If you are an \\"old school\\" Simple Plan fan, you may have difficulty in accepting this album, but it is truly a spectacular album. Simple Plan's original teenage fan base from their first 2 albums are now into their 20s and Simple Plan has adjusted its tone to reflect its maturing fans, making a large leap away from their \\"life sucks\\" high school punk roots.<br /><br />This was the first Simple Plan album where I actually enjoyed each and every song, so much so that it is hard to pick any stand-out favorites. The ballad \\"I Can Wait Forever\\" is without a doubt the album's best song, followed most likely by \\"Your Love is a Lie\\" and \\"What If\\". I also thoroughly enjoyed the heavily criticized \\"Generation\\" - it has a good beat and is very catchy.<br /><br />I'm not a huge fan of synthesizer or electronic melodies, but for some reason, they seem to fit the songs of this album. It will be interesting to see what Simple Plan will put out next, but I for one hope they will grow again with an even more mature rock sound.

0385342020|5.0|I thought this book was great! I have enjoyed all of the author's books, but I found this one to be more touching than most. It made me want to call my Grandma and listen to all of her stories! I laughed and cried....wonderful!
B00006JJ1O|5.0|This album is awesome, and soooo many people can agree. As someone who was mostly underground hip-hop, i love t.A.T.u. as much as i love Jedi Mind Tricks!
0765356139|4.0|I enjoyed this book much more than the first one. The attacking armies pose an interesting problem for Elend and gang, though they spend a large amount of time talking about what to do, and not actually doing anything. Zane and Vin were entertaining and there were plenty of twists and turns in this novel. The last two parts were especially good. Unfortunately I think the fight scenes are a bit drawn out and the plot doesn't progress fast enough for my liking. There is plenty of complaining and people feeling sorry for themselves as well. Even with those drawbacks this novel is well worth your time. I wanted to know about the Well of Ascension and the thumping and the armies and Zane and so many other things! I can't wait for the next novel. There is much to love in this series.
B00171NZE4|5.0|This DVD is so heavy and badass, KoRn in all their glory.  All the original lineup, and literally almost all of my favorite songs.  They get into it and go crazy as hell, my kinda stuff.  Multiple chills down my spine at some good moments, like the end of Dead Bodies Everywhere where Jonathan Davis and Fieldy just go all out.  It has everything perfect.  Just the right amount of time on each of the instruments; and you hear the crowd when you should--not ruining the music.  It's like studio quality.  It's amazing.  Has everything a Live DVD SHOULD have; except no special features.  Thats okay because i'd rather just watch the DVD instead of hear some commentary or see band footage outside.  I wanna see them jam themselves out on stage, setting the bar for badass-ness with the songs they play.  This DVD = Awesome.
1416550542|3.0|Kate Morton admittedly loves the classic Gothic tales.  In her second novel, \\"The Forgotten Garden,\\" this Australian author attempts to treat her audience to a beloved melding of styles and themes, the likes of which have been tested successfully before in Bronte's [[ASIN:030745519X Jane Eyre (Vintage Classics)]], Du Maurier's [[ASIN:B000GH2YPG Rebecca]] and Victoria Holt's [[ASIN:0312384157 Mistress of Mellyn]].  Morton gives it the old college try and she creates an interesting albeit long and sometimes ironically tedious labyrinth of characters whose secrets stretch out well beyond their own life spans to touch and baffle the generations that follow.<br /><br />Morton moves her plotline from three different directions.  Using the third person narrative to tell her tale from the perspective of her key three women, the mystery surrounding the identity of Nell, a four-year-old child found abandoned at the port in 1913 Maryborough, Australia, slowly but surely comes to light as the older Nell in 1975 and her granddaughter Cassandra in 2005 allow the reader to piece together their findings along with the eventual exposition of the enigmatic Eliza Makepeace, the writer of the old book of fairytales discovered in the tiny suitcase that comprised the lost child's only belonging.<br /><br />Morton's technique of seesawing between flashback and present day scenes mimics that used frequently by television screenwriters presenting a modern day puzzle that has roots in a past era that is anything but the expected charming.  She utilizes alternating chapters told from each of the appropriate third person vantage point for the moment in time when actual facts are brought to light in the chronological story.  For example when the sixty-five-year-old Nell snaps a mental piece of the puzzle into the overall story timeline that spans the years 1900 to 1913, the reader flips from the actual time period of the discovery to the actual happenings in the past told as they occur from the perspective of the characters they most influence.<br /><br />Unfortunately, as clever as this mode of storytelling might be--it seems to work well in larger scoped mini-series where the past and present share equal precedence--it jars the reader into a sense of confusion at times, causing the first third of the book to seem murky and disjointed.  However, as the reader becomes accustomed to this jumping back and forth--this is a huge novel of over 600 pages--the plot becomes easier to follow. Ironically, Morton achieves a total immersion effect where the complexity of her muddled structure adds to the reader's urgency to not only complete the book but to overlook the obvious contrivances necessary to pull it all together at its climax.<br /><br />Despite her ability to move the reader through her intricate structure, Morton suffers from what I can only call acute character similarity syndrome.  When the reader is privy to Eliza, Cassandra, Nell and a raft of other players' thoughts via the third person voice, Morton does nothing to distinguish this voice psychologically.  She describes the pain of these creations as they stumble through contact with their personal demons, but there is nothing that indicates, if one were to randomly choose a page, which character is which beyond the mention of name.  This results in a bit of a time jolt or pause in the action that makes much of the background description framing each change of time superfluous and boring to the point where this reader was actually skipping through to defining action that moved the plot forward within each chapter.<br /><br />Subtract also the rather melodramatic addition of characters and events that seem straight out of the penny dreadfuls of Dicken's time.  The dastardly Mr. Mansell, the oddly pining Uncle Linus, the social-climbing Adeline, the Swindell family of Artful Dodgers, the Montrachet family of wreckers and smugglers--shades of [[ASIN:B000K4Z9KM Jamaica Inn by Daphne du Maurier]]--the secret garden where Eliza brings her beloved cousin back to life (Frances Hodgson Burnett of [[ASIN:1402714599 The Secret Garden (Unabridged Classics)]] fame actually makes an appearance in the novel) and a jumble of other tried and true cookie cutter characters just add to the over abundance of events and verbiage that if cut could have whittled this tome down to at least 400 pages.  The events of which I speak, I will not detail as they will definitely spoil the reader's satisfaction as each portion of the mystery is eventually revealed.  Suffice it to say that much rides on some pretty hasty decisions made by players that need a healthy dose of pragmatism.  Much ado is made of Linus's strangeness, yet he seems to function only as a red herring of sorts--I hate to say it, but he needed some extra appearances during the scenes at Blackhurst to identify him as more the viable perpetrator.<br /><br />Where Morton really shines is her ability to concoct a brooding atmosphere where the dark fairytales of her Eliza Makepeace are able to gather the strength and power of thunderclouds over their perspective readers and listeners.  Obviously using as inspiration the delightfully bizarre illustrations of Arthur Rackham, Kay Nielsen and Edmund Dulac (fairytale illustrator enthusiasts, check out: [[ASIN:1606600036 East of the Sun and West of the Moon: Old Tales from the North (Calla Editions)]],[[ASIN:B000YJ93VY Perrault's Fairy Tales - Folio Society Edition Illustrated By Edmund Dulac]], [[ASIN:0486446859 The Arthur Rackham Treasury: 86 Full-Color Illustrations]], [[ASIN:0486436691 Dulac's Fairy Tale Illustrations in Full Color]], and [[ASIN:0486449025 Nielsen's Fairy Tale Illustrations in Full Color]]), Morton creates a way for her heroine to process the harsher realities that life has set upon her by imagining and immersing within a world that albeit ruthless and cold protects her from loneliness and endows her with a valiant perseverance that can only have roots in the absolute and idealistic universe where fairies, witches, princesses and magical beings abide.<br /><br />Bottom line?  Perhaps the secret in Kate Morton's \\"The Forgotten Garden\\" can be unearthed by even by the most unimaginative reader; the clues are all there just waiting to be tallied and analyzed.  Or perhaps, the hurried tone of the novel and its short chapters will not allow its reader time for investigation.  Each segment segues with the quickness of gunfire to detail what those in the present have discovered about a past they most likely thought vintage and charming and fraught not with the dangers and avarice of men and women intent on their own desires.  Nonetheless, Morton's technical construct will either befuddle the reader with its complex backwards and forwards motion or will urge its audience onward until the forgotten garden shines again with the personal truth sought by its one-time inhabitants.  Although Morton lacks the finesse to fully flesh out the uber-psychological eccentricity of Mrs. Danvers of Rebecca, or depict the wistful insouciance of Martha Leigh in Holt's \\"Mistress of Mellyn, her decision to star in her drama an author of Victorian fairytales works magnificently to offset her stereotypical cluster of character types from other Gothic tales.

B001FB55H6|1.0|I am so glad I rented this movie before buying it.  I absolutely hated everything about it.  It was boring and nasty.  I'd much prefer Iron Man, X-Men and Spiderman.  Since when do Superhero's try to rape one another and beat women?  Ridiculous.  Don't waste your time even if you can view this for free.
B001QTXM5Y|5.0|I bought the full book a year before this movie was announced based on my friends recommendation. I read half of it but never got the time to finish it.<br /><br />When the movie was announced I got excited because I already knew the characters and can watch it instead of reading through it.<br /><br />I preordered the blue ray and finally got it.<br /><br />This is an amazing movie! When it finished I went to see the Book's ending and found that the movie is a lot better than the Comic Book!!! A LOT!!!<br /><br />Very good directing, the sequence and events are so similar to the comic and even better!!<br /><br />A lot of people were complaining about the Blue Guy's John showing all the time. That's not really an issue.<br /><br />Excellent Movie, I am so glad I got it!
B000F8O35U|5.0|The DVD arrived in time for my daughter's birthday :)  She has enjoyed watching the DVD.
B001LMAK88|5.0|Silverado came out back in the 1980s when I was in high school. I saw it then, and enjoyed it. I recently purchased the DVD, watched it again, and still enjoy it. Silverado contains a lot of classic Western elements - cowboys, gunfights, bad guys, saloon scenes, etc. But, it is a little different than many of the classic John Wayne, Jimmy Stewart, and Clint Eastwood Westerns. The characters are diverse and quirky, and the dialogue is rather clever.<br /><br />The cast is well chosen, and the plot is easy to follow, which leads to plenty of action scenes. My kids especially liked the character Jake (Kevin Costner) who acts kind of like a grown up kid. Kevin Kline's character is a somewhat off-key hero, but does the right thing in the end.<br /><br />If you enjoy classic Westerns, you will most likely enjoy Silverado as well. It may not be as intense as others, but it will keep you entertained. In fact, it is one of the more underated modern Westerns, and worth watching.
B001WCN232|4.0|Let's be clear about one thing: even at this day and age no one has figured out how to help poor old GHS's pitiful sound quality all that much and for good reason; it has to do with the original recording studio. Gus Dudgeon, Elton's John classic era producer tried to record Elton's \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\" there once, only to give up and go home. He claimed the the studio sounded like '10,000 japaense radios' and he went on to say that he didn't know how the Stones ever got GHS out of there. Even on this attempted remaster the sound is muddy and lacks any sort of 'pop' in the snare or 'kick' in the bass drums because of this.<br />  One good thing though - the hiss is all gone, and that really helps tracks like \\"Angie\\" and \\"Can You Hear The music\\"; the  uncovered percussive acoustic guitar now drives \\"Heartbreaker\\" to nice effect. What saves this album is the great songs, no matter how cluddery things get at times. This is probably as good as it can ever sound.
0061767581|2.0|Did she write it? Well, it's not very well written, in fact it's pedantic, so perhaps she did. It is the first of her three book deal. Yes, there are two more coming our way, hence the \\"to be continued\\" type ending. If you watched THE HILLS, this is a road map to how the casting was done, how the girls were thrown together, and how \\"unreal\\" reality TV is. Look, she's famous (for being famous) and has a huge following. She and her handlers are trying to make as much money off that fame while she's still hot. Next, she'll probably cut a record or get her own talk show. It's the way it is.
0688170528|2.0|I expected something more at the end of book when we \\"found out\\" what really happened, it just seemed so.... so, I don't know even know what but just not what I expected.  On a separate note, it was a bit bothersome to have the author use the Lord's name in vain sooooooooooooooo many times and often with laced with profanity.  I think she should perhaps be a little more thoughtful to people of the Christian faith and how over the top her use of it was.  Maybe next time she use a profanity using buddha, confuscious, etc., etc.,   Just saying.
B002DKGWSE|5.0|So now Hollywood is remaking virtually every horror classic it can put its hands on...<br /><br />Certainly the whole thing has a very simple explanation: a) Hollywood studios already own the rights to those films; b) these classics have a huge built-in fan base; c) they do not require 100 million Dollars to make; d) many of those classics look dated to the eyes of young viewers; e) so let's redo them and cash in the fact that everybody will wand to see an updated version of a classic; f) because most of today's horror is crap anyway; g) and everybody loves a classic! So there's nothing really new here and the remaking of [[ASIN:B001JV5BIA The Last House on the Left]] is no different from all other remakes we have seen in recent years.<br /><br />But the good thing this time is that this remake benefits from:<br />- A classic story of revenge (something audiences everywhere empathize with),<br />- A great cast with actors who can really carry a character,<br />- A great screenplay that keeps the good things,<br />- A great director who understands the importance of creating genuine tension,<br />- Lots of good taste.<br /><br />This last element is the most controversial if we think this story is very brutal (perhaps the most brutal storyline in all those classic horror films from the 70's). Two girls get kidnapped by a family of violent criminals on the run. One of them escapes barely alive... while, on the other hand, the killers end up spending the night in the house of a nice couple who happens to be the girl's parents. Now, in the immortal words of James Brown: \\"Payback! Revenge!\\" (laughs) Yes, the film is very violent. Yes it gets very brutal and bloody.<br />But YET it NEVER gets TOO over the top, TOO exaggerated or TOO unbelievable (once you forget the huge coincidence of the premise) because the story is THAT good. Yes it gets desperate, bloody and heavy... but the story asks for it and the scripts constructs it well.<br /><br />So I think this is perhaps one of the best remakes I've seen in this recent trend of remaking the classics. Of course the original film had some kind of magic that is impossible to reproduce - and I think this new version acknowledges that. the original was cheap, dirty and low budget. In fact, I believe the original 1972 film was one of the best candidates for a great remake because a) it had a truly great screenplay to begin with and b) was one of the cheapest/worst looking/worst polished of all those 70's and 80's films we now call classics.<br /><br />And that's what really shines on this remake: the care that was invested in order not only to do a remake... but also give us a truly memorable and gruesome story of revenge. Now... after having said this, let me tell you all: that last scene is incredible! It does go over the top. But we forgive it because revenge is so human and the script is so clear that we do go along.<br /><br />For better or for worse, THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT is one of those classic horror stories we all love to watch. It gave us a great film more than 35 years ago and (thanks to the producer's care) it gives us now a great update.<br /><br />Recommended for those who can stand it!<br />...And I know you can!remaking the classics.

B0002OXVDW|5.0|This DVD is the most beautifull thing of the golden age of movies.  I love it !!
0307454541|2.0|The first 70% of this book is interesting and fast-paced, with a compelling story, intriguing characters, and an ambiance and setting that really add to the mystery.<br /><br />Then, it's as if the book was finished, but the editor couldn't figure out how to integrate the secondary story into the timeline and just added 100 pages to deal with the problem.<br /><br />I was surprised at how abrupt the shift was, how poorly executed it was, and how essentially needless. In light of the final section of the book, I actually reassessed my mostly positive view of the bulk of the book, and retracted the recommendations I had made to friends to read it.<br /><br />I've read many books that seem to end with a thud, as if the author wasn't quite sure how to wrap up all the threads and couldn't find an elegant or fitting way out. But this book ended with a thud, and then kept falling into the cellar.<br /><br />Too bad.
B00005QGAX|5.0|I love the previously unreleased songs like \\"Streetwalker.\\" It gives you insight into MJ as an artist, and especially now since he has left us.  The music, and discovering these \\"new tracks,\\" is all the more special.
0060899220|3.0|This book is funny - funny in the sense that I vascillated between being engrossed in certain chapters and in others I felt myself wondering, \\"Will it ever end?!\\"  The decriptions and tales of what goes on in restaurants were fabulous.  However, if I read one more time that very few people could survive in the kitchen, I would have vomited. (He should try a day in the classroom with kids, where the pay is not quite the same).  Also, the author tries so hard to be modest that he ends up sounding totally obnoxious at times...All in all, it's a skimmer.
0143034901|4.0|Having read and thoroughly enjoyed The Angel's Game I was extremely excited about this book that most readers found superior.  I guess I am in the minority.  While this is a pretty good book it was no where as gripping as The Angel's Game.<br /><br />On his 10th birthday Daniel Sempere is indoctrinated to Cemetary of Forgotten Books by his father, who is a dealer in rare books and who was a minor character in Zafon's other book.  At the cemetary, a visitor is allowed to select one book.  Daniel is drawn to a book called The Shadow of the Wind which was the last book written by an obscure author called Julian Carax.<br /><br />Daniel is fascinated with the book, refusing to sell it to Antonio Barcelo who offered him whatever price he can name for the book.  Daniel decides that he wants to track down more books by Carax and does a quest.  He finds out that Carax is presumed dead and that virtually every book he has written has been destroyed.  Those who have read his books agree with Daniel that he is a great writer.<br /><br />At the urging of Barcelo, Daniel keeps Barcelo's daughter (Clara) company by reading to her.  Young Daniel is fascinated by Clara who is sightless.  Soon Daniel is visited by a crazy man who is the one who is destroying Carax's books.  The man has a badly burnt face and he has the same name as an evil character from Carax's book.  He demands Daniel give him Shadow of the Wind (which Daniel had given Clara to hold) or something bad will happen.  Daniel claims he knows nothing of the book but the crazy leaves him with a warning.<br /><br />As the years go by, Daniel will lose Clara and fall in love with Bea, an engaged woman.  He will also become friends with Fermin, a former homeless man that his father brought into his business.  Fermin will aid Daniel in his quest to find out what actually happened to Carax and to possibly locate and books that haven't been burnt by the crazy man.<br /><br />As Daniel and Fermin search they cause trouble with those who want the Carax story to remain forgotten.  Daniel continues to be plagued by the crazy book burner and an evil police officer (Fumero).<br /><br />I did not find the tale as intriguing as the other Zafon book and I sometimes had to go back in the book to remember who certain characters were.  It would have been useful if the author has listed a cast of characters.  Also, I found the italic print used to narrate the retelling of the past to be difficult to read and there is one long chapter totally in italic where the print was giving me a headache.<br /><br />Overall this is a very good book but definately not as good as Zafon's other book.forgotten.

B002A9OJ0Q|2.0|I agree with the other non-5 star reviewers that I wanted to like this album.  I really tried hard.  Not to mention, any new album from an 80s band that's not released in the United States is going to look real nice in my import collection.    But this album is next to awful.    I do not consider this a return to form like 90% of everyone else does just because it contains electronic bleeps.  I'll admit their past few albums were more acoustic/organic than the A-Ha of the 80s but bleeps are here just for the sake of needing to include bleeps and A-Ha has never had to resort to that before.  A return to form would be making new songs in the style of their heyday, in order to produce a very listenable (albeit not particularly groundbreaking) album a la Erasure \\"Light at the End of the World\\" or Simple Minds \\"B&W 050505\\".    The lyrics are stupid.  Now I'm not expecting a Pet Shop Boys or Alphaville out of every new wave band, but this album is ridiculous - it's full of rhymes that would make Mother Goose roll over in her grave.  I.e. \\"The phone is off the hook / as you sink into a book\\" (Nothing is Keeping You Here) or \\"Learn from my mistake / Leave what others take\\" (Foot of the Mountain) or \\"Don't fix me, it breaks my heart to see you try / don't fix you, and leave me for some other guy\\" (Real Meaning)  To top it off they make things flowery, such as when talking about the \\"high and beautiful crest.\\"  If the lyrics are going to be this bad, I suggest muting/blurring the vocals enough so you can't decipher them unless you try.  (This actually works in \\"Mother Nature Goes to Heaven.\\")      The first half of the album can barely hold itself together.  It's a mish-mash of electronic styles that they try so hard to make fit together.  The second half, on the other hand is a disaster.  In \\"Nothing is Keeping You Here,\\" Harket attempts to bring back the soaring vocals he's famous for but puts them in the wrong place and nearly ends up destroying the song.  To be completelyhonest, the song sounds like a bad Shins rip-off and I KNOW that's not that A-Ha was trying for.  The final track, \\"Start the Simulator,\\" just leaves you feeling dirty inside.  Not even sure why \\"Start the Simulator\\" or \\"Shadowside\\" exists. (Worth noting - the latter sounds like a bad Nada Surf rip-off.  90s-00s rock bands are supposed to be the ones lifting from 80s bands - NOT vice versa.)     This is no Scoundrel Days, Hunting High & Low, East of the Sun/West of the Moon, or even Major Earth Minor Sky (which wasn't perfect, but good in its own right.)  There are a few songs that are on the upper side of tolerable (Sunny Mystery, What There Is) but even these have caveats.    I'd give it one star but it pains me to give A-Ha the lowest possible rating, and to be fair while this is easily the worst album the band has put out, there are other bands that make even worse albums.  So two stars.     The problem: A-Ha has just tried too hard.
B001GCUO16|5.0|Hey all...    I have read over a view of the previous reviews & talked with a lot of people that have viewed this film in the theaters...  I have also seen the movie myself 2 times...    I can understand a few of the complaints about not sticking to original comics or stories etc...    However, the movie was very good...  The acting, special effects, story, and characters was all excellent!!!    The story leads up to0, or very close to0 where the 1st xmen movie took off...    I cannot wait to see this movie again... I will definately buy it, and would highly reccomend it for the action and more...    I have heard there will be another Wolverine movie as well, so look for it...  Thanks...

B0000AOV85|5.0|Great documentary on one of the greatest (if not THE greatest)rock albums of all time.  So interesting to hear the thought processes and stories behind the songs.  Roger Waters is especially articulate in his recollections.  Really cool to see Alan Parsons engineering the record, and to gain an appreciation for all 4 individuals.  This work is truly the sum of all the parts.
0307588335|1.0|As a former Lehman Managing Director who worked with many of the key characters in this book, Lawrence McDonald excepted, I would strongly recommend potential readers to avoid this poorly written, turgid, self-serving drivel.  The author, a relatively junior employee, clearly had no access to most of the protagonists in Lehman's demise, other than a small coterie of New York Fixed Income colleagues.  This is an ill-informed rant, which simultaneously attempts to whitewash a select group of individuals.  There is a great book out there waiting to be written about the fall of the House of Lehman, but this is not it.  If I could rate this no stars, or preferably negative stars, that's what it would get.
B00260HH3K|3.0|OK the haters are really blowing things way out of proportion!  This movie is NOT a horrible piece of trash like they say.    It's actually pretty entertaining and fun to watch.     The biggest problem with the movie is that fans were expecting a perfect translation of DragonBall Z and this is NOT supposed to be Z, this movie takes place right before Z in the original DB series.  The Original DB was a adventure comedy like this movie is, fun fluff for kids with a fantasy feel.    By the end of the movie it sets everything up for the Z series to start (Z is all crazy action and huge epic fighting scenes) But unfortunately fans did not support this movie so I doubt a Z sequel will be made.       The other issues is that the movie is a bit low budget, and they did change things in the adaptation process, but no more than say the Spider-Man or X-Men movies.      For DB fans I say go ahead and watch it I give you permission, don't nit pick it, just set back and enjoy a re-imagined fresh look at your favorite series.    If you don't like it's ok, it's not like the existence of this movie will some how destroy your DBZ anime collection.    For non-fans if you liked movies like the Forbidden Kingdom or Dragon Wars this movie is for you.      If you lower your expectations this movie is really fun to watch!  I wish I saw it in the theaters now, even if it's a little short.
1439102813|5.0|This is a hauntingly beautiful book about a fifty-year old professor who is diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's.  Alice seems to have an enviable life:  she is well-educated and respected in her field; she has three adult children and a wonderful husband.  However, a frightening diagnosis forever changes her and her family members as well.  Lisa Genova writes from Alice's point of view, giving the story an intimacy and immediacy that is emotionally wrenching and left this reader dissolved in tears.<br /><br />The reader is privy to Alice's reaction to her diagnosis and the increasing ravages Alzheimer's extracts on her.  From the subtle changes in Alice's everyday life to the drastic changes that undermine everything she thought about herself, the reader is her confidante, her companion on this journey from normalcy to an increasingly confused mind.<br /><br />This intimate portrayal will touch everyone, perhaps those around Alice's age or older even more so.  One of the most touching scenes occurs between Alice and her youngest daughter Lydia, one with whom she has had a somewhat contentious relationship.  Alice fears that one day she won't know Lydia and won't know Lydia loves her.<br /><br />  \\"You're so beautiful,\\" said Alice.  \\"I'm so afraid of looking at you and not knowing who you are.\\"<br />  \\"I think that even if you don't know who I am someday, you'll still know that I love you.\\"<br />  \\"What if I see you, and I don't know that you're my daughter, and I don't know that you love me?\\"<br />  \\"Then, I'll tell you that I do, and you'll believe me.\\"<br />  Alice liked that.  But will I always love her?  Does my love for her reside in my head or in my heart?<br /><br />Alice's descent into the dark and ugly world of dementia is terrifying to her and to her family.  But Lisa Genova gets it right, the facts and the feelings, the way Alice lives it daily on her steady progression into her uncertain future.  As Alice's lack of recognition of her family comes, the reader is moved by Genova's eloquence, searing in its impact, unforgettable in its raw emotions.<br /><br />Just as moving are the glimpses we get of her husband John who at first denies the illness, then accepts it and fights for Alice as he struggles with his own career options.  Likewise, her other two children have Alzheimer's-related issues to grapple with.<br /><br />If you've ever known or cared for someone with this devastating disease, this is a must read.  Even if Alzheimer's has never touched your life, you will be captivated by Alice's story and be forever grateful to the author for raising your awareness of this life-changing occurrence.'s eloquence, searing in its impact, unforgettable in its raw emotions.

B001FB55H6|4.0|Hey look, a review by someone who actually owns and has viewed the Blu-Ray!<br /><br />The Film:<br /><br />Declared \\"unfilmable\\" by many, \\"Watcmen\\" comes to us directed by Zack Snyder (director of the equally faithful but truly horrendously bad \\"300\\"), who seems determine to say \\"oh yeah? I'll film every stinking panel!\\" Does this make for a good movie? Hmm. Yes and no. This film has many fine qualities, but it also has some fatal flaws.<br /><br />Among its fine qualities are a wonderful visual sensibility, which aptly recreates the comic book while also maintaining a mostly realistic aesthetic which only rarely inspires giggles. Many of the performances as well are good, especially those of Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson), Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley), and Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup). Wilson in particular stands out, he radiates a naive and goofy charm, and hopefully this is a star-making performance for him. In fact, I didn't find any casting decision to be a bad one, even though some have written that Malin Ackerman was a bit wooden as Silk Spectre II. I disagree. Everyone really delivered in terms of taking the material seriously and delivering a performance that matched the flavor of the comic. Popular music is used to great effect as a backdrop for the action. A very complicated story is presented in a coherent manner that most any movie-goer can grasp onto.<br /><br />Fatal flaws include:<br />-Its enormous, bloated length. My attention really started to flag during some of the longer fight scenes.<br />-Conversely, length was an issue in the other way as well. Because a 12 chapter novel has been condensed into three hours, a lot of character development is lost. It becomes hard to care about some of the characters because of the relative short shrift they are given. I think the story would have been better suited to a 12-part miniseries on television, giving the characters time to breathe.<br />-The literal nature of the movie adaptation is a problem for someone who has read the book several times. It's not exciting and thrilling as a plot goes, it's merely an exercise of thinking \\"huh, they got that in there, cool.\\"<br />-Conversely, the literal nature takes a weird vacation in the ending, in which the space monster is replaced with something that the writers and producers of the film must have felt was more \\"Realistic,\\" but actually turns out to be less believable in terms of the world depicted.<br />-The violence came off as over-the top at times. After about the ninth or tenth long, languorous shot of a severed limb with blood raining down, it just becomes boring, if not a tad annoying.<br /><br />In the end, it's a good comic book movie. It has a lot to offer. It doesn't have the emotional coherence of a film like \\"Dark Knight,\\" probably because it tries to shoehorn 10 times the story into nearly the same running time. It's a nice thing to own if you're a fan of the book. If you're not, you might come out of viewing this scratching your head.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray:<br /><br />The Director's Cut gives us about a half hour more footage than the theatrical cut, though not the \\"Black Freighter\\" footage that will be integrated for the Christmas edition this year. Frankly, I'm glad this was left out - I found it to be kind of a drag while reading (yes, i get it, we're all depraved and will turn into cannibals if the stuff hits the fan), and it would have made an oppressive film length even more onerous.<br /><br />Picture quality is very good. The film is quite dark and shadow laden, with an extremely stylized color palate, loaded with blues, greens and yelllows. Thus, it is not perhaps the most impressive \\"realistic\\" HD presentation you'll ever see. But it does the job, and presents the film without any real artifacts or jagged edges, and film grain is present but not obtrusive. A lot of fine detail is evident in cloth and faces, as long as you have your gamma and brightness properly set.<br /><br />Audio is given to us in a VERY aggressive DTS HD mix, too aggressive for my tastes. I really do not like it when I have to adjust volume constantly on the fly, when giant explosions threaten to blow out speakers after quiet dialogue has been turned up. I'm sure this will please some, though. I just prefer a more level mix.<br /><br />Extras are presented in 1080p (with subtitles, a very nice touch) on a second disc. They include a 28-minute documentary about the comic, a 26-minute piece about the psychology of vigilantism, and a 16-minute spot about the technology of the Watchmen world. All are good, with the first probably being the best. I might have liked them all better if they had been integrated into one documentary.<br /><br />The main disc contains \\"Maximum Movie Mode,\\" a video commentary with Director Zack Snyder. This includes timeline graphics, still galleries, comic comparisons, and so on, all presented real time with the film. The film will play as usual, but then a graphic will pop up or the film \\"screen\\" will fall back and reveal Snyder and another \\"screen\\" of comparison or behind the scenes photos. It's pretty neat, but I kind of miss the more traditional style of commentary.<br /><br />********<br /><br />In summary, I've given this presentation of the film 4 stars. The material itself is problematic but of inarguable quality and dedication. It was obviously a labor of love. The 3 disc Blu-Ray is a very good presentation of the film, with an in-depth graphical commentary, some good documentaries, and the obligatory digital copy disc for your iPod or laptop. Those who want the additional \\"Pirate Comic\\" material would be best served by waiting for the more complete edition this Christmas. Personally, I'm happy to keep that located entirely within my paper copy of the book.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the book, this is an easy recommendation. You'll enjoy it and there are many layers to explore. If you're not already a fan, though, this is a cautionary recommendation. This is not the greatest comic book movie ever made, nor is it even a particularly great film *as* a film. It's too long to enjoy in one sitting, too short to do the story and characterization justice, and the story just doesn't \\"breathe\\" in the same way that sitting down to really read a digest the graphic novel does.<br /><br />It's a pretty good action movie.

1594202249|4.0|Thomas Pynchon does so many things so brilliantly that we should not be surprised that he has now produced a terrific noir crime novel, INHERENT VICE.<br /> He mixes the hard-boiled story of druggie-surfer-P.I. Doc Sportello (great name) with those ubiquitous Pynchonian flights into philosophy and uber-truth.<br /> John D. MacDonald (the Travis McGee series) was the first crime novelist I can remember who would put the brakes on the plot and dialogue for a page or two in order to rhapsodize about the world and its meanings.<br /> Ulterior motives are now common among crime guys.  Carl Hiaasen wants us to laugh yet consider the rape of Florida's environment as well as hear his stories.  Richard Price gives a dead-on, brutally honest view of the Lower East Side of New York City in LUSH LIFE.  James Lee Burke always seems to include his poetic descriptions of the eucalyptus trees of the Deep South.  Andrew Vachss wants to expose the horrors of child molestation as much as tell Burke's tales.<br /> Pynchon is merely continuing this tradition of giving the reader double-dips of enjoyment in INHERENT VICE.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001PIJF7A Speedo]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001RCUGYA Cop, Cop, Lawyer (Joe LaLuna)]]

0786891084|1.0|I usually LOVE cecelia Ahern books.. However I hated everything about this book. It had no story to it, it was like reading through someone's emails.. It was boring the whole time,I couldn't relate to Rosie at ALL because of her stupid and unrealistic choices, and when the book FINALLY ended.. it was nothing special at all. You could see it coming from page one. The ending leaves the reader dissapointed with nothing but a feeling of time wasted. I only rated this book with a one star because I finished it hoping it'd get better, it definitely did not!!
1416585710|5.0|I'm only on page 76. I have to say I was worried. I came onto Amazon to read reviews and see if there was any hope. Writing has always been my biggest challenge- but what I most admire. I bought this book because I needed something creepy and exciting to distract me from work (and life)- and King is always my go-to guy for that. Well- it's not what I was expecting. Not even close. It's been a difficult read- for me. The dialog is very rich (in a not so rich way)- and the character Lisey is in and out of memories and the present (reality?) so often my head spins a bit. But here's the thing- I've never thought of story telling as a business. I myself am an artist- and like all artists- I hates me a critic. I understand the need for critics. Kind of upholding the law, keeping up the standards so we aren't flooded with Times New Roman bile. But- I think of story telling as an art. Or rather, a story is a work of art. I know there are rules to be followed. But the writer is free to follow them as they may. If someone from Maine, or Massachusetts, or Tennessee, or where ever is telling you a story- are you going to stop them and tell them to get on with it? Hurry up? Go back to the drawing board- edit this and that. The way I see it- Lisey is telling us a story. It might not be the style I would use. Anyhoo- after reading almost equal bad and good reviews- I have to keep reading it. I like books that challenge me. Challenge my patience, my nerves, my roller coaster emotions... I am always surprised that the books that pissed me off or made me experience something other than fright or envy or concern- are the ones I call my favorites. That is an art. Books that take you places you don't want to go. Frustration, impatience, worry, depression, happiness, guilt. I think it's good to go there. I say- let the expectations go and read what comes- with an open mind. That is something I've come to admire about King. You never really know where he's gone with each story you begin to read. His reputation with horror has actually hurt his chances to reach readers in other ways. Actually, I wonder if Scott isn't actually a personal homage to himself. Perhaps the barn is an illustration for King's own mind. Anyways... I am going to keep reading. I owe that to Lisey.
B000002C1W|4.0|More people need to give this album a chance.  There are too many Pink Floyd fans that dislike this album, mainly because Roger Waters is gone at this point.  David Gilmour is the main component here, and Nick Mason performs on about half of the songs and is credited as a member of the band.  Richard Wright is on a few songs as well, but is only credited as a session performer.  Many of the hardcore fans can't handle this fact, and dismiss this album as \\"not really Pink Floyd\\" or \\"a Gilmour solo effort\\".  I disagree, although I do understand where they are coming from.  Sometimes great bands lose members, but the remaining people continue to carry the torch and sometimes do quite well, this is one of those times.  Besides, The Final Cut was as much or more of a Waters solo album as Momentary Lapse was a Gilmour solo album.  Roger had his chance with The Final Cut, and it did not do very well, now it was David's turn to showcase his talents under the Pink Floyd name, and without Roger and his big ego there to overshadow him and the other guys.<br /><br />I give this album 4-stars becuase first off amazon doesn't let you do 4-1/2 (and it doesn't quite deserve a full 5), also a few tracks are duds, and yes, this isn't a FULL Pink Floyd effort (No Waters was ok with me, but with Mason and Wright here only as part-timers, you really only get 1 original guy and half of each of two others).  But on the other hand, I think that the songs \\"Learning to Fly\\" and \\"On the Turning Away\\" are incredible songs that are as good as some of the classic Floyd songs, and even better than alot of them.  Those two are both 5-star songs, combined with some other good ones like \\"Sorrow\\" and \\"One Slip\\" make this a strong album.<br /><br />Of course it is pretty obvious that I am a bigger fan of Gilmour than of Waters.  I think that anyone else who is a fan of the more Gilmour-influenced albums like Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here will really enjoy Momentary Lapse of Reason.  Those of you who are more for the Waters-influenced albums like Animals, The Wall, and The Final Cut probably won't enjoy this one as much.re more for the Waters-influenced albums like Animals, The Wall, and The Final Cut probably won't enjoy this one as much.
B0000029LG|5.0|Amazon, why is Mirkin's crappy \\"Editorial review\\" still there? Does this guy even listen to music? I love your store but please it's time to recycle this old review ok? It's stupid and insulting and makes y'all look sorta stupid.
B001R4MEYS|5.0|I have found my favorite album of all time. Crack the Skye.    First off, however. A warning. Crack the Skye is not Blood Mountain, Leviathan, Remission. If you fell in love with Mastodon because of the way the songs sounded (heavy, fast, etc.) then you may get disappointed. If you fell in love with Mastodon because of their musicianship (composition, ambitious arrangements, depth) then this album will satisfy you greatly.     The people who would hate this album are those who have this view of what Mastodon and Metal in general should be. They should play loud, violent, heavy music. I won't argue against them. I like that type of music. I can honestly say that those qualities drew me close to Mastodon and Heavy Metal in general. But unlike heavily devoted Metal fans, who have this perception or idea of what Metal should sound like, my musical tastes tolerate much more. No. Demand more. I have to get moved by the album as well. There has to be a feeling of \\"wow-ness\\" provoked not just by the amazing riffs being executed but by how the music is being played and with what intentions. To say that, for example, the sheer heaviness of Master of Puppets is what made me fall in love with Metallica would be wrong. No. It's how the compositions works together. It's how the build up of \\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\\" sounds perfect, or how the soft section in \\"Master of Puppets\\" simply adds something special to the song. It just doesn't sound cool. It sounds sophisticated. Even artistic. And it moves me. I mean, that's why us metalheads are metalheads. Because we don't like what's out there. What's \\"popular\\". It's the transition from what is considered normal to what makes us feel like the artist is playing for us. That's why we love Metal.    Which is why I, as a person who not only loves music, but Metal in particular, enjoy this album, Crack the Skye, so much. I don't close the possibility of Metal being different from what it currently is. It shouldn't be all screams, blistering solos, violence, darkness, the usual fun Metal stuff. It can be soft. It can be gentle. It can go deep and give you something different.     Therefore, if you have a perception or idea of what Mastodon should sound like, then you might not like this album too much. But if you demand more, then this will certainly do you some good. It feels amazingly well thought. The production is clean. None of that loudness war crap you hear from other artists. Excellent sound quality. The arrangements are incredibly complex. The tempo changes add to that special feeling I talked about. And the riffs are pretty good. They're not, yes, I'll admit, not as \\"cool\\" as the ones you hear in their previous stuff. But they're not meant to be. Hunting for a good riff here is trying to look if the tires of a Ferrari are good looking. No. Back up a bit, and look at the bigger picture. If you do, you'll be pleasantly surprised to find that the riff in the song works with other parts of the song, the same way a tire works in conjunction with the brakes and the transmission, engine, etc.     Well, hopefully this rather weird review helps people understand what this album is and what it's trying to achieve. It's not as menacing as their previous work. But menacing doesn't always mean it beats the rest.

No way you should try to read this without having read the first book.  This one gets off to an awkward start trying to bring the new reader up to speed with the events of the first book - it doesn't really work, and there are some things that just have to be read in the original to make any sense (Lisbeth's stolen fortune, her blackmail of Bjurman, her affair with Blomkvist, just to name a few). Consider yourself cautioned.<br />3.  This book paves the way for the next one, leaving a lot open question about who is gonna go to jail, and who is gonna get away with murder, and why.<br /><br />Looking forward to the next one; in the meantime,  I'll get more Swedish bleakness and criminality in the Wallender books.

B002NXSRX4|4.0|\\"G.I. Joe\\", much like last years [[ASIN:B001KZIRM2 \\"Transformers\\"]] sequel, is an action film of the most common denominator. It's bright, flashy, loud, occasionally obnoxious and rife with eye-rolling stabs at inducing laughter. Yet whereas \\"Transformers\\" could be genuinely funny, \\"G.I. Joe\\" seems painfully unaware that its attempts at crowd pleasing humor almost always fall flat. For starters, the two leads are grossly miscast. Channing Tatum, who portrays Duke, is the lesser offender. Though he certainly looks the part of a square-jawed All-American soldier, he's among the most wooden actors I've ever seen in a massive-budget Hollywood blockbuster. Eternal twelve year old Leonardo DiCaprio could act circles around this guy, and that's saying something! But though Tatum may be lacking in versatility and range, he makes up for these shortcomings in that he's a likeable enough fellow. So much so that I wouldn't mind a whit seeing Tatum star in a sequel. Besides, let's face it, a film based off a toy line and Saturday morning cartoon doesn't exactly require Daniel Day Lewis types.<br /><br />By far the worst component here is Marlon Wayans as Ripcord. Considering the character is intended as comic relief and a foil to Duke's more straight-laced gung-ho soldiering, I can understand the producers felt compelled to cast someone with a background in comedy. Unfortunately, Wayans is as hammy as a club sandwich and a terrible actor to boot. Despite a packed theatre, nearly every one of his flimsy jabs at humor failed miserably (though one joke in particular, uttered when Duke proposed to Ana, elicited a fair amount of laughs). The dialog exchanges between Duke and Ripcord is b-movie quality weak, particularly at the beginning of the film. The bulk of their banter is composed of jokes we've heard many times before, jokes that were lame the first time told. This exchange is particularly weak:<br /><br />Ripcord: \\"You know Duke, I've been thinking...\\"<br />Duke: \\"What have I told you about that?\\"<br /><br />Ripcord: \\"...I've already submitted an application.\\"<br />Duke: \\"They take those in crayon?\\"<br /><br />The one clever, nearly hilarious joke involving Ripcord actually has nothing to do with Wayans' performance. When donning his advanced Delta 6 suit, he's told the equipment has integrated artificial intelligence that will respond to whatever he's thinking. Instantly, images of Scarlett (who Ripcord is deeply attracted to), flash across his helmet visor. But that's the one solid moment of humor, otherwise this goofy interpretation of Ripcord is one of the films weakest points, and though he'll probably be a hit with children, for anyone older than twelve he'll come across as naught but irritating.<br /><br />The action setpieces, which are certainly the main draw of \\"G.I. Joe\\", are absolutely flawless. So much so that this was my fourth favorite action-oriented film released last year. The majority of those who didn't enjoy the film either didn't see the trailer or were under some sort of strange impression they were going to see an Oscar contender. The straight action is sole reason to see this film. The two best, most memorable action sequences include an excellent assault on the Joes headquarters and a lighting-fast race to save the Eiffel Tower from the nefarious Baroness and Storm Shadow. Most of the Joe favorites are here, including: Snake Eyes, Scarlett, Destro, Cobra Commander, Cover Girl, Zartan, General Hawk, and Heavy Duty among others. Each one of these characters is well cast and even resemble their cartoon counterparts quite well (particularly Dennis Quaid as General Hawk and Sienna Miller as the Baroness).<br /><br />I appreciate, however, that the crew didn't feel it vital to strictly adhere to the comic book and cartoon interpretations of these characters. Had they done that, the Zartan character would almost assuredly look hilariously absurd! I've noticed many reviewers have complained that there's \\"too many\\" characters, but that's part of the fun of a film adaptation of comic book material like G.I. Joe or [[ASIN:B000AYELVA \\"X-Men\\"]]. If anything, I found myself wanting to see more characters, and cannot wait to see the new ones that will feature in the sequel. The G.I. Joe universe has a host of novel players to utilize, including my personal favorites Shipwreck, Gung Ho, Dial Tone, Flint, and Dusty. Will any of those feature in the sequel? Time will tell.<br /><br />One of the producers, prior to the release, stated that all the futuristic technology featured in the film (including the nearly invisible camoflage clothing and variants of the Delta 6 suits) was a mere ten to twenty years away from being reality. This is true for the most part, adding a small dose of authenticity to what is, admittedly, a very silly testosterone-fueled explosion-fest. The most prominent technological fantasy invention would have to be Destro's missiles which feature sophisticated nanotechnology. Speaking of fantastical inventions, one of the most bizarre scenes is when Breaker attempts to use a device to read the final thoughts of a deceased baddie. He jabs two poles into the corpse's head and uses a cell phone sized device to attempt to scan the dying memories. As if that isn't enough, we watch as the body rather gruesomely decomposes in mere seconds due to a self-termination device implanted in him, also using the same nanomites the missiles use.<br /><br />There are numerous flashback sequences between Duke and the Baroness and between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow that add a modicum of depth to the story. The Snake Eyes/Storm Shadow feud goes way back to the comic books, though here (perhaps in the interest of time) it's reduced to something much more simplistic. I'm not well versed in G.I. Joe canon, so I don't know if it's been previously established that Duke and the Baroness had a relationship, but its a great story element to help tie the characters together. There's even a grand flashback piece at the very beginning of the film that adds some intrigue to Destro's story. The pace of the film is never ruined by these flashback scenes, which is a difficult feat to be certain. As the film's byline states, this is the \\"Rise of Cobra\\", so I hope that in the sequel we get to see an entrenched, organized Cobra military as opposed to the mostly freelance gang of mercenaries featured in this film.<br /><br />Ultimately, \\"G.I. Joe\\" will not be remembered as a great film, but I feel genuine pity for someone who cannot watch a film such as this and simply have a great time. The plot is typically simplistic, involving the tried-and-true \\"protect the valuable object\\" scenario we've seen in countless other recent films (such as [[ASIN:B000NA28I4 \\"Eragon\\"]] and [[ASIN:B001KMB6YG \\"Babylon A.D.\\"]], off the top of my head). Still, though the story may not be terribly complex, it's well told and doesn't detract. Well, except perhaps for one of the final scenes, in which Cobra Commander and Destro don goofy-looking helmets and share an evil cackle together. Yes, Mr. Screenwriter, as much as we appreciated the numerous nods to the classic cartoons, some things should've been left in those cartoons. Hopefully in the sequel we'll see a more involving tale, because even though this film may be explicitly targeted at the young, a handful of blockbusters have proved general audiences can handle a slightly more complicated story, such as [[ASIN:B000EGDB10 \\"Mission Impossible\\"]] or [[ASIN:B001GZ6QC4 \\"The Dark Knight\\"]].<br /><br />I feel it prudent to stress again that, at times, \\"G.I. Joe\\" is nearly unbearably stupid. Keep in mind that the film is merely a vehicle for exciting action sequences, and as that, it's an absolute success. Those sequences are tight, frenetic and well choreographed. This is, of course, the primary reason one should see the film to begin with. More than that, it's a memorable film, which is more than I can say for some recent action flicks such as [[ASIN:B001J710Z2 \\"Bangkok Dangerous\\"]] or [[ASIN:B001RHGRT8 \\"The Spirit\\"]]. In summation: if you have a hearty appetite for action and are willing to shut off your brain for two hours, there's not a single dull moment in \\"G.I. Joe\\".igue to Destro's story.

0375812024|5.0|I recently purchased this for a plane trip that I was going to fly solo with my 2 year old son.  This size it great for traveling.  Big enough to see all the intricate illustrations but small enough to fit into a bag.  Also it has a soft cover and is very light weight.  Now the important part, my son loves this book.  It was great for keeping him entertained in the airport.  I would point out things in the book and then show him the same things in the airport.  Lot's of fun and now he has something to remind him of the trip.

B000YPUF9W|4.0|So, just how many super-secret, super-huge, underground, scientific lairs does the evil Umbrella Corporation have??  And will they never learn?  Playing with zombies is very dangerous, and could very well mean the end of humanity as we know it.<br /><br />RESIDENT EVIL - EXTINCTION is the third installment in the RESIDENT EVIL series of zombie flicks.  Picking up approximately 5 years after the end of RESIDENT EVIL - APOCALYPSE, the deadly virus created by the Umbrella Corporation has escaped containment and turned the world into a barren waste land. Humans, dogs, birds, rats, and all other living creatures have been turned into mindless, flesh-eating zombies.  The remaining humans who have survived the virus are in a constant battle for their lives, banding together in roving caravans.  Our hero Alice wanders the planet on her own, killing zombies wherever and however she can.  In answer to a distress call, she rejoins some old friends, and together they make a break for the last known, virus-free outpost.  But Alice's powers continue to develop and grow, and the Umbrella Corporation wants her back...at any cost.<br /><br />As with RESIDENT EVIL and RESIDENT EVIL - APOCALYPSE, RESIDENT EVIL - EXTINCTION is a monster-killing, gore-filled zombie flick that is unexpectedly entertaining, and is perfect for an evening of mindless relaxation.  I never imaged I could enjoy this series so much.  The pace is fast and bloody, the plot is a bit more substantial than the previous two installments, and the acting is standard for a monster movie...but then again, you don't watch monster movies for the acting.  And the special effects in RESIDENT EVIL - EXTINCTION out do themselves for the title of Best On Screen Decapitation Ever, clearly besting the previous title holder, the original RESIDENT EVIL.<br /><br />RESIDENT EVIL - EXTINCTION is bit of a departure from the modern day B-movie genre of the first two movies.  There is a little less camp, and lot more \\"jump out of the dark and go BOO!\\" in RESIDENT EVIL - EXTINCTION, taking it more toward the horror genre.  Still, my husband and I had a really good time watching this this.  The ending is a perfect set up for the next flick, which promises to launch the most formidable zombie destoying army yet.  Go ask Alice...SIDENT EVIL - EXTINCTION, taking it more toward the horror genre.  Still, my husband and I had a really good time watching this this.

B001UV4XU6|3.0|(500) DAYS OF SUMMER is a cute movie with two very likeable stars.  It's narrator tells us at the beginning, \\"this is NOT a love story,\\" but it is at the very least a story of romance.  We meet Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a greeting card writer who really wanted to be an architect and is CERTAINLY a hopeless romantic.  He's painfully shy, but we just know from the sincere twinkle in his eyes that he's a good guy.  One day (Day 1), Tom's boss gets a new assistant, Summer (Zooey Deschanel).  She's lovely, vaguely zany, has huge, twinkly eyes and Tom immediately falls for her.  Because  he's shy, it takes awhile for a true relationship to build.      Summer tells Tom she isn't looking for love, and doesn't even believe in it.  Tom, we know, IS looking for love, and he believes very strongly and sincerely that  he's found it with Summer.  So he's torn by his desire to find his soulmate in Summer, yet distraught by the fact that as they move from day 30 to day 150, she still won't even say that they are boyfriend/girlfriend.  She seems to like Tom a great deal...and they seem to make a good couple.  But she continues to make it clear to Tom that they are \\"just friends\\" and that their friendship cannot lead to anything deeper...since Summer doesn't even believe in that.     It's a simple dilemma for Tom, who is really our \\"hero.\\"  Can his love finally win her over to him, can he be happy just being friends-with-benefits, or should he cut her loose and look elsewhere?  For Summer, will she realize she's somewhat stringing the guy along, because even though she SAYS they aren't \\"a couple\\" she sure acts like they are for a very long time?      This is a 3.5 star kind of movie for me.  The performers are charming, although Summer's character, to me, was really more of an idea than a real person.  I never bought her single-minded refusal to understand that when you practically live with a guy and share your bed and your free time with him for around a year you can't just be nothing special.  Deschanel is most certainly a most interesting actress.  Gordon-Levitt has long since left behind his 3RD ROCK NEXT TO THE SUN persona and has emerged as a true force, at least in \\"indie\\" films.  The film contains many, many wry observations and cut scenes.  The two have a couple of silly but charming scenes at their local IKEA.      However, this 3.5 star film became a 2.5 star film when Director Marc Webb and writers Scott Neustatder & Michael Weber felt their film needed to jump around in time.  As the film goes on, we jump from (for example) day 488 back to day 15 to day 186 to day 30 and then back to 488...and so on and so on.  It's not confusing to keep up with, don't get me wrong...but it is pointless.   I don't think anything was gained from this device...and to be honest, much was lost.  My wife and I both agreed upon walking from the theatre that it felt like ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND-lite.  Yet, where that movie had a reason for its time-jumping (and would not really even have worked without it)...500 DAYS just feels needlessly meandering.  The use of a narrator was needlessly fanciful...most of what was explained to us could have been readily understood through the script and performances.  There are other \\"fantasy\\" sequences in the film...most notably a scene the morning after Tom and Summer first make love.  He's bursting with joy, and as he strides from his apartment, we see him strutting to Hall & Oates' YOU MAKE MY DREAMS COME TRUE.  This eventually turns into a full blown production number (although a low budget one)...and felt like ENCHANTED meets the awkward moments in SPIDERMAN 3 when Tobey Maguire struts around to \\"Staying Alive.\\"  (Full disclosure time:  I've always kinda liked that song, so the whole scene put a smile on my face.  Frankly, if the film were going to go this way, it needed MORE out-and-out fantasy.  What we get is a \\"gritty, little romance\\" peppered with jarring bursts of tone from another film altogether.)     I gather this is a first directorial effort for Webb.  He seems to have a nice way with actors...but he doesn't frame shots terribly well and he makes the city of LA look drab.  Even when Tom is showing Summer the architecture he enjoys in the city, there is no joy in the seeing of it.  (I think of Sam Waterston's architect showing Dianne Wiest and Carrie Fisher around in HANNAH AND HER SISTERS.  Woody Allen knows how to make a city seem romantic.)      So, 500 DAYS OF SUMMER crumbles a little bit under the weight of its artiness...but even so, you may find just enough to appeal to you when you get past the trickery and find the heart of the film.
0446677450|5.0|Overall, the book contains interesting ideas. The ideas are certainly valuable. However, it is not a \\"how to\\" book. You will need to read it and judge for yourself and decide what would work or not work for you. One also will need to excercise one's own judgment regarding some of the 'advice'. I gave it 5 stars as I enjoyed as thought provoking.
B001FB55H6|1.0|I hate, hate, HATED this movie.  I hadn't seen it until I obtained the Blu-ray.  I have never read the comic, though I have heard from those who have and many of them are not all that taken with this adaptation.<br /><br />The characters are dull and unremarkable as are the \\"action\\" scenes.  The song cues are oh-so-pretentious and uninspired.  To make matters worse, this Blu-ray release is the three-hour \\"director's cut\\" and it goes on FOREVER.  The shorter theatrical cut should have been included in this disc set because it must certainly be an improvement (or at lease more merciful).<br /><br />I cannot recommend this movie to anyone except perhaps to someone I dislike.  When one takes into account the wealth of well-produced superhero movies available for viewing, this thing is just a huge waste of time.  I'm not being facetious when I say I would honestly rather sit through \\"Elektra\\" again instead of this dud.<br /><br />Zack Snyder is an offense to the art of motion pictures.  Like Michael Bay, he seems to think it's acceptable to make a movie that is little more than a glorified TV commercial.<br /><br />I'm not one who slams popular movies on the internet with the intention of causing a ruckus.  This movie is just so monumentally bad that I can't even keep it in my collection, which already has its share of \\"questionable\\" entertainment.<br /><br />To end on an up-note and give credit where it's due, I thought Patrick Wilson was quite good, as was Jackie Earle Haley.  For those of us who are Kelly Leak fans, Mr. Haley's recent screen resurgence is a delight.  Lamentably, his performance is sabotaged by that same dumb \\"scary\\" voice effect that took \\"The Dark Knight\\" down a few notches and ruined Tim Roth's performance in \\"Planet of The Apes\\".  Will someone please explain to these Hollywood [...] that such vocal effects are distracting and most certainly not an improvement?!
0340977094|5.0|[[ASIN:1439144907 A Most Wanted Man]]    This reviewer lives in the country where the novel's plot is located, Germany, though not Hamburg. I am flabbergasted that my country again provides the locale of machinations that smell, nay stink, of the foulest cold war activities of the German, British and worst of all, US American secret services. As a lawyer by profession, I find the actions of all of them utterly repulsive.     I am grateful however to John LeCarré that he has taken up the possible and even probable background for these actions and exposed their perpetrators. Absent any proven involvement of Issa and Dr. Abdullah in Islamistic crimes, the services act as if they were and thus, I presume, habitually violate \\"habeas corpus\\" and the \\"not guilty until proven\\" protection we all should enjoy. And yet, does \\"A Mosted Wanted Man\\" prevent any illegal activities of certain Government agencies?
B002JCSWHA|5.0|From Tokyo, where the film has just opened: In Japan, most people know about Hachiko, especially in Tokyo; his statue is a popular meeting place in the Shibuya shopping area. The true story of Hachiko is just as well known here in Japan. In this review, I assume that you know the basic story outline. Still, if you wish to avoid what you may consider a spoiler concerning a turning point in the story, then avoid reading after this paragraph, as I discuss a central plot point--but not one which really gives too much away, any more than it spoils the movie \\"Titanic\\" to know that at some point, they hit an iceberg. Still, I wanted to warn you just in case--someone who never heard of the Titanic before might enjoy the whole iceberg twist.    The story: a faithful dog comes to meet his master at the train station every evening when he returns home, and when the master, a college professor, dies at his school and does not return, Hachiko continues to come and wait at the station every day for nine years to wait for his master's return. The very thought of such a loyal, sweet animal being so, well, doggedly committed to finding his master is bound to bring tears to most people's eyes--and it didn't fail here, with there being a considerable amount of sniffling and eye-dabbing in the theater. \\"Not a dry eye in the house\\" comes to mind. If you like schmaltzy tearjerkers and cute fuzzy dogs, then this is your kind of movie.    The basic story remains the same as the actual one, but builds up a new human dram around the dog story--which succeeds in not detracting from the central story at the same time. You never stray far from the dog, it's clear that Hachi is the protagonist and at most we spend three minutes away from him at any one time. Nevertheless, the characters are fairly well developed for what they are--supporting roles. Joan Allen does a good job as the wife reluctant to allow another dog in the family after the last one left them. Jason Alexander has a bit of fun asthe self-centered station manager, and recognizable character actor Erick Avari does an excellent job as a hot dog and coffee vendor outside the station. Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa did surprisingly well as the Japanese expert at the college. But the dog is the star, and does a good job of keeping our attention.    I contrast this with a movie from last year in Japan, \\"The Tale of Mari & 3 Puppies,\\" about a Shiba Inu dog owned by a family when a large earthquake hits the region. The movie, billed primarily as a dog movie, mostly focused on the family and featured more than a little over-acting from the supporting cast, and failed to show us the cute doggies so much. In \\"Hachi,\\" it's the reverse--you get lots of dog time, but also a nicely-rounded drama with good acting all around.    A few things were overdone, but not to bad effect. At the movie's outset, we see Hachi as having been sent, unattended in a bamboo cage, all the way from Japan--not just Japan, but from a Buddhist temple in Japan--only to be lost on the last leg of his journey when he falls off of a handcart at Gere's train station. That (a) the person pulling the cart could be so careless and (b) that whatever local person paid so much money to have the dog shipped and then never inquire as to what happened to him, well, is kind of pushing it. It feels as if Gere wanted to put in a nice Buddhist reference and have Hachiko's tale be a bit more dramatic. You kind of roll your eyes at all this, but it doesn't get in the way of the story. None of the overdone bits go so far as to really distract from the story, and they do work well at the emotional level. In the end, what you have is a fun little drama about an adorable, faithful dog with a tearful ending; the movie does very well being what it is supposed to be.    A bit of background: the story of Hachiko is not completely without controversy. There are some who claim that the story was deliberately popularized in fascist pre-war Japan as a means of inculcating loyalty to the emperor and to the state--the idea being that Hachiko's utter faithfulness up to the bitter end was a model that the government wanted the people to follow in supporting the state. Of course, Gere's film does not come close to this; there is even a specific reference to loyalty as pertaining to those one loves. Other detractors of the story contend that Hachiko was not being faithful to his owner, but had simply become addicted to the treats given to him by shops and vendors near the station (interestingly also included in the new film).    A small note: Hachiko, both in reality and in most of the film, was an Akita, but in this movie, Hachiko the puppy was played by a Shiba Inu, a smaller, related breed whose main difference is in their size and temperament. Despite being regarded as a \\"goof\\" in the IMDB database, this was an intentional choice by the film's producers, who decided that a Shiba puppy would be easier to handle, easier to train for what was needed--so says a book released in Japan concerning the film.
B00006JKOL|4.0|Minstrel in the Gallery - (1975) 12 Tracks (5 bonus)  **** (58:02)<br /><br />The opening track is a monster of a song, clocking in at over 8 minutes, it's got a traditional acoustic guitar start before it moves into an electric rockin' wonderland of sounds provided by the whole band going at full tilt!  Powerful vocals by Mr. Ian Anderson and some of the heaviest riffs by Martin Barre you will ever hear.  Another stand out track is Baker Street Muse, which is a 16+ minute medley of songs.  The rest of the album has some decent songs on it, but I was just not familiar with them.  The remastered version of this disc contains 5 bonus tracks, including a live version of Minstrel in the Gallery, but only the intro of the song.  The other bonus tracks are nothing to get excited about either.  This is really a 3½ star album in my opinion, but it gets rounded up to 4 stars for the Title Track alone.
B001AQMBNC|3.0|I will say for all French Canadian. There was french dubbed track in a lot of dvd... And now there is no more french in the re-released title Blu Ray! What the? I grew up and listen to this awesome movie with the french track why they just cut it out! COme on!
B00006JJ2Y|3.0|An interesting album - part music and part comedy. Personally, I prefer the band that recorded Rock 'n' Roll Animal and Lou Reed Live, but there is some great music here. The interesting part that has been barely touched on by any other reviewers is that this album was recorded with two dummy heads mixed together. The idea behind dummy head or binaural recording is that if played back over headphones, a reasonable replica of a sound field can be heard. But they don't sound good over speakers (this also applied to Street Hassle and The Bells - look for the SBS symbol). Unfortunately, two dummy heads mixed together ruined the potentially startling effects that a single head would have produced. The very first bit with Lou talking and blowing smoke in your ear is quite unnerving.
B001ET0826|5.0|Of all the prince albums I have listened to since I was 5 years old, this one is truly one of the wildest and wackiest albums in music history. The title track \\"come\\" really takes it to another level sexually when he actually said \\"can I f***k you baby and can I suck you baby\\" really must have made some listeners fasten their seat belt for what was actually going to be heard from beginning to end . The song \\"loose\\" is filled with some blazing guitar work by prince as well as the beginning of loose with prince screaming help makes the song \\"loose\\" an unpredictably crazy yet entertaining song.  The track \\"let it go\\" is one of the best on this album and should have received some recognition. The last song on this album is truly the perfect way to end an album and definitely is an icing on the cake to the other songs that have such  explicitly hard and heavy content. There should have been a special show or segment by the HBO TV network about this album because, this album is as raw as any album I have ever heard in my very life. The HBO TV network is known to show graphically wild, tough, things and I think they would do a good job in making a late night special concert or something to their creativity on this very album alone that seems to tell a story of a world that is straight up wild & freaky.

B000KC86F4|1.0|What a major disappointment this film turned out to be. The first two films in the series directed by Brian Singer were not necessarily accurate, but still had weight to them. This installment however brings nothing to the table but action scenes with no weight. Major characters are killed off with little fanfare leaving the viewing audience with the most uninteresting mutants to fight the final battle. Underdeveloped characters like Collossus, Roque, Angel, Kitty Pryde and Iceman step in to fight the final battle. But they are so underdeveloped that we just don't care what happens. The Phoenix storyline which should have been the focus, is reduced to a subplot. Magneto, who was somewhat sympathetic in the first two films, is reduced to a cackling villain who doesn't care about the very mutants he is sacrificing for. Note the line in the final battle where he states while mutants are falling in battle..and he says this smirking..\\"this is why the pawns go first\\". This is so out of character from the first two films. Xavier also has a line that he delivers to Wolverine, \\"I don't need to explain myself, least of all to you.\\" Why would he say that to Logan? Completely out of character.     The final battle is so absurd. Magneto moves a bridge but can't bring a building down? And his master plan is to throw flaming cars at the X-men? That's it? FLAMING CARS? THE MUTANT WAR THAT WAS BUILDING UP CAME DOWN TO FLAMING CARS? And Jean Grey does nothing for most of the movie but watch. She kills Xavier and Cyclops without any remorse. This movie just plain sucked. For me personally the trilogy begins with X men Origins Wolverine. I know many people did not like it, but I thought it was pretty good. It wraps up with X2 as Logan's story comes full circle from Origins. X3 for me is not part of cannon. I wish Singer or someone else, anybody else would direct another X men film that ignores the events of X3. Or just start over. That's all.
0385342020|5.0|I'm one of the rare people that didn't like the Shopaholic series or Becky Bloomwood.  But I've rather enjoyed Kinsella's stand alone books so I thought I'd give this one a go and I was not disappointed.      Twenties Girl is so much more than just a chit-lit.  It has romance, mystery, friendship, humor, heart and the paranormal.  Don't be put off by the paranormal aspect of the book, it's like no other ghost story you've ever read.  The first 4 or 5 chapters are a little difficult to get into because Kinsella is setting up the the story for us.  Stick with it though, because believe me when I tell you, you'll get to a point in the book where you cannot put it down.      What sets this book apart from your average chick-lit is the mystery woven into the story.  It'll keep you glued to the book wanting more and more information.  The friendship between the 2 main characters is also extremely humorous, believable and has so much heart.  I finished this book in 2 days and many of you will probably finish it faster because like I said earlier, you'll get to a point in the book where you will NOT want to put it down!!

B001FB4W0C|5.0|So I used to watch Supernatural religiously the first season and then I kind of lost interest during the second season for some reason. So I have been sort of playing catch up over the year. And I could not wait to see season 4 after i finished 3 and I really wanted to be able to watch s5 on TV every week like I used to with s1 so me and my brother searched the internet and found s4 online!!!!! Let me just say that was a lot of computer time to finish this season but Oh MY GOD was it worth it! Season 4 is bar far the best season in my opinion. Just the introduction of the Angels for me made it so cool and Sam and Dean trying to stop Lilith from opening the 66 seals!!! ahhhh it was just awesome. And surprisingly this was without a doubt THE FUNNIEST season of Supernatural ever. Dean is freakin hilarious this time around even more so than usual. The episode \\"Yellow Fever\\" had me and my brother Cracking up laughing the whole time ^_^  and the season finale was amazing, a great cliffhanger. Cannot wait till season 5!!!!!
B000GX57YK|4.0|Much has been written about the below average HD transfer of this remake in HD DVD and Blu-ray but this doesn't ruin the movie for me since I've seen a lot worse transfers than this. Anyway if you're familiar with the Michael Caine original than you'll even enjoy this revisionist remake of the '70s film. Wahlberg makes a fine hero, Theron is nice to look at and Edward Norton is a lot of fun as the villain you'd love to hate.  If you liked \\"Oceans 11\\" then you'll enjoy this.  I've knocked one star for the video quality of this in HD but the price of this in HD DVD versus the Blu-ray is so obscenely low that it definitely ranks as a best buy.  Like would you pay $5 or $6 for this disc in HD or close to $20 in Blu-ray--go figure.  Anyway if you like Wahlberg also check out in HD DVD, \\"Four Brothers\\" and \\"Shooter\\" all at a bargain basement price in HD DVD!!

B0014I4KH6|5.0|I actually listened to Fearless first before I heard this album.  Fearless just blew me away so I gave this a try and now I can see why she's a star.  For someone as young as her she can write such vivid and moving lyrics that it's amazing.  You can find something in this album that you can relate to, and if not you could imagine it so well.  She has both talent in her vocals and in composing her songs.  This album will bring you back to the days of sweet summer when love comes and goes and you had time for the little things.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|This is just a fantastic concept - very well done and emotionally very moving.    Stand By Me is obviously the one that kicked everything off -   but One Love is just astounding.    This is a very generous package with both a DVD and CD at a ridiculously low price.    Should really buy multiple copies to give to friends, and support the project.    Simply beautiful.
0452286751|5.0|I found the writing to be very rich and fast-paced. The characters and storyline were, for me, gripping and exciting to the very last page. The love story is twisted, and simply delicious. The main characters, Roarke, Dominique, Tooey and Wynand are all peculiar and fantastic in their own ways.<br /><br />The main characters have very distinct roles and outlooks, which was also true in Atlas Shrugged. The are very bold, passionate about their points of view, and expressive. I greatly enjoyed them, and I'm sad now that I've finished the book (which rarely happens for me).<br /><br />The underlying theme of the independent spirit, and the fascinating observations the author has made about society really come together in the 4th part of the book. I found myself reading and re-reading the final monologues of the characters, reflecting on their insights.<br /><br />5 stars. I would recommend this book to anyone. I wish I could find more books like this.
B002JM1VJG|5.0|I'll never forget the first time I saw Madonna on American Bandstand and she said, \\"I want to Rule the World!\\"  Great job Madge!!  You've done just that!  Highest grossing tour by a single artist EVER and she is still touring and all of this is a bad economy!  I LOVE the new single and kids if you listen real close you will hear that she's singing to Jesus!!  Smart, Clever, Fun, Dance Music, and she references her whole career in the lyrics.  She says, \\"Get on your mark, Step to the beat boy that's what it's for!\\" and you KNOW she means it!!  Can't wait for the album and DVD!!
B001EYGOEM|5.0|Incredible album where every single song is balanced and you can pick out the theme right away.  The music is catchy the lyrics are real and touching.  I haven't picked up an album in which  I can love every single track from the first to the last.  I also haven't picked up an album in which I can listen to for 2 weeks continuously and still feel that it's as good as when I first heard it.<br /><br />If you haven't tried it out, you must.  I haven't listen to any country or country pop music in over 10 years but this is an album that crosses the categories in that you don't have to like any one genre to appreciate it.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|I wish I could have seen this concert live!  You will be mesmerized by the singing and dancing and the incredible talent of the king of pop. I don't think there will ever be another talent that comes our way in my lifetime that will have the stage presence, or the ability to sing and dance the way Michael Jackson did.  As a young teenager I saw him perform with his brothers and sisters as the Jackson's and even then Michael was amazing and had a stage presence like no other.  In this video, Michael will captivate you and will leave you yearning for more when the video comes to an end.  My husband and I have watched this concert 3 times since receiving this video and enjoy it just as much if not more each time we have watched it.  You definitely need to purchase this one!

B002CAWNEM|1.0|A man and lady move into a new home.  The man has an important position at a big corporate job.  The husband met his wife when she was his secretary.  Later we find out that the wife does not like the man's secretary being a woman.  They made a promise that he would not have a female for the job.  So, in comes this new girl.  When she first sees the man on the elevator she kind of stares at him.  They start talking and she drops her papers.  As the man is helping her pick them up she runs her hand over his.  Seem obvious.  Well that's how the whole movie is.  The lady is at a Christmas party with the man and starts getting all over him.  He tells her to stop and she acts like she does not know why he is acting like he is.<br /><br />Now, you would think that he would tell his wife.  When he calls her though, it just so happens that her sister's husband has just left her.  So after the man hears her talk about that, he decides not to tell her.  Then, he is going to tell his boss.  His friend though tells him that the lady may turn it around.  Seeing as how he met his wife after she worked for him at on point.  He still decides to tell his boss.  But before he does the boss tells him the girl has left the company.  Sound annoying?  My God is it ever.  Every time the man gets a change to stop what's happening, or to tell someone, something happens in which that does not occur.  It's like a movie made by a bunch of art house goons.  My mom and I were thinking Fatal Attraction.  But this was no wear near as good as that movie.  It was a complete waste of money.  There were also things that happened, that led to nothing.  Like at first, when the secretary would be around the man, he would always look at her legs.  Why?  He didn't like her, and never acted like he did.  Also, when he calls the cops in the end.  They take FOREVER to get there.  Somehow they get their when everything is over.  Plus, the husband gets to the house at the same time as they do.<br /><br />In the end it comes down to this.  This was a really bad movie.  A complete waste of time and money.  The entire movie, this guy keeps having bad luck when it comes to letting someone know about what is going on.  The secretary try's to play a crazy deranged character, but makes you laugh at how bad she is at doing so.  Also, through the movie you will think you know what is going to happen.  I will save you the time and tell you that everything you think is going to happen, happens, exactly the way you think it will.  The move isn't even 1 hour and 45 minutes.  But it drags on and on and on.  This could have been such a good movie.  If it had not been done a thousand times before.  I can see why people didn't like it when it first came out;  Save your money.  Rent a different movie.down to this.  This was a really bad movie.  A complete waste of time and money.

B0014I4KIK|3.0|Released in the U.S. about a year ago, I'm finally coming around to listening to the entire Duffy disk, 'Rockferry'.<br /><br />It is easy to see why most reviewers and fans might lump Dusty Springfield in as huge influence of Duffy. There are aspects of that (\\"Warwick Avenue\\", \\"Mercy\\"). But the disk probably owes as much to artists like Jackie DeShannon and songwriters Burt Bacharach & Hal David (\\"Rockferry\\" & \\"Stepping Stone\\").<br /><br />For sure she is a throw-back, as all of the aforementioned artists were very 1960's-based.<br /><br />But what you get is what you see/hear. Duffy is an ok vocalist and a decent songwriter. I'm a little fascinated how her voice can soulful and a little tinny at the same time. The record isn't a studio creation - it's not strong enough to be. It is what it is. She sounds the same way live - which is more than you can say of the train wreck - Amy Winehouse.<br /><br />I like the disk, but it's not one I can listen to for the entire length, just a few songs at a time. Still it is new and it is old all at the same time. Not such a small feat.
B0000DJE9R|5.0|Great selection of songs.  The original release of this CD included the song Human Nature and has since changed and not sure why.  None-the-less, it is still a great selection of songs.  I highly recommend this album.
B000006045|5.0|Bought this cd a LONG time ago. Can't really remember anything about the delivery experience. The album is pretty cool.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|I absolutly love this CD/DVD. it is an incredably talented and awe inspiring performance.It is great to see people around the world coming together to create a change for music especially when some much music today spreads hate and violence.Have baught this as gifts for friends and family and they have all enjoyed it very much as well.spend the money you won't be dissapointed.
B000063DI8|4.0|I can't believe the reunion albums have higher ratings than No Prayer and Fear O' the Dark! To any Maiden fan or anyone just getting into Maiden bypass the reunion albums and get these two first (after you get the stuff from the 80's)! Both No Prayer and Fear of the dark are 4 stars in my opinion. The songs on the reunion albums are cool and progressive and that's great, but they sound the same to me a lot of the time and don't have the same atmosphere of the CLASSIC Maiden albums, of which the last two albums Bruce made with the band before the reunion are worthy of being called!
B0000C9ZBW|5.0|My husband became a Black Belt and this watch was my gift to him... it is all black... he is now a second degree black belt and still LOVES his watch and the memory.
B0012GMW0C|5.0|This album is incredible. This is Journey, uncut, un corporate \\"prettied up,\\" and raw. This is the pre-Steve Perry/John Cain, Corporate \\"pretty-boy\\" rock that everyone's used to from Journey. Every musician on this album is top-notch, and this is an example of what happens when you let top-notch musicians do what they want to do.     This album is organized chaos - jams that first appear to be just jams, but, upon listening again and again, have highly complicated, ingeniously arranged musical nuances that put this band in a class of its own. It's a constant, flowing vascilation from calm, melodic keyboard pieces to all out, insane, full volume Jazz/Rock mayhem. This is progressive rock at its finest, and everyoneplays every songlike it's the last one they'll ever play. This album really cements the original Journey as one of the greatest bands of all time.    Neil's guitar work is absolutely stunning, and Aynsley Dunbar's drumming is incredible. I'm definitely a fan of Steve Smith (who replaced Dunbar on the Evolution album and was with Journey throughout most of their \\"pop\\" phase)who is a highly talented Rock (and now Jazz) drummer, but Dunbar's combination of Jazz/hard rock drumming sets him in a class of his own. This is even more apparent on Look Into The Future.    The other \\"Star\\" of this album (aside from Neil Schon) is def. Gregg Rollie, who's voice I enjoy more than Steve Perry's often high pitched, whiney tone. He's a talented vocalist but just gets annoying after a while. Steve has an excellent vocal range but his whiney tone and the softie \\"radio\\" songs he sings gets old. Gregg's voice are sharp, dark, soulful and cunning, and his non-perfect pitch variations mark the lack of over-perfection/production of this album (reminiscent of Led Zeppelin's first album) that brings about a bad-ass feeling of its own, and his uncut, un-corporate \\"unregulated\\" piano/organ playing style is incredible.     Ross Valory, in my opionn one of the industry's best bass players, kicks tail on this album. All throughout the tracks you can hear him distinctly, and he has no trouble keeping up with Aynsley.     George Tickner, the group's short lived rythym guitarist, also lays down some nice chords and helps to add more of a soft \\"Jazzy\\" sound, evident in \\"Of A Lifetime\\" and \\"Topaz.\\" However, he is often drowned out by the rest of the band. He would leave the group after this album.    This is definitely an exploration into the world of progressive work, and is indicitave of Journey's true talent/ability. This album says something about the abilities hidden within Valory and Schon (who are still with the band). Making this album even more of a rare gem is that Dunbar would leave (actually be fired) after the release of Infinity and that Gregg Rollie would leave just after the release of Departure (which features the pop smash \\"Anyway You Want It\\" as the opening track).
B001L51RQE|4.0|I was a Police fan before anyone heard of them. My friend and band mate had a friend who was a DJ back in the 70's and he would receive albums by bands that were up and coming. We thought these guys were something special and it turned out about a year or so later, the world thought so too!<br /><br />This is a well produced set with camera work that doesn't jump around so much to make you sick. Of course Sting gets the Lion's share of the camera time, but we do get to see Andy and Stewart doing their thing quite often. It's a very good set of songs, but fans of their studio recording may be disappointed. Being a three piece band has its limitations live and the harmonies and other over dubs are sorely missed on certain numbers.<br /><br />I understand why they had to change some song's arrangements as The Police are a very processed band, at least on the later albums and it's almost impossible to duplicate their sound live on certain songs. Even though they are polished from years of experience gone is the raw power of youth and it's sad to hear sometimes as we know we are growing old with our favorite bands.<br /><br />I appreciate that fact they wanted to keep it simple and this DVD sounds much better when played loud, but I almost wish they opted to hire some backup singers as Andy is barely heard on backups and adds nothing to the missing vocal harmonies. Copeland is an exceptional drummer, but he seems a little restrained here either from Sting throwing a hissy fit or just from aging.<br /><br />For under $20 for a full concert and an interesting documentary, stills galleries, plus a two CD live set you really can't go wrong here. I know a lot of people think Sting is a bit of an ego maniac, but having been in bands and played both the sideman bass player and the leader front man I know that with it comes a lot of pressure. Don't judge too harshly until you've been in those shoes. It's no cake walk and I almost prefer when someone else is in charge....I said almost.  The only plus is you get to do your songs, your way.<br /><br />For fans of The Police there is a lot to be happy about with this release, but don't think you'll be hearing perfect renditions of your favorite songs.et to do your songs, your way.

B00288KNJU|4.0|I did not see Coraline in the theater, but I decided to give this movie a try after hearing some buzz and for the simple fact that I enjoy stop-motion animation.  Coraline is an entertaining and quirky film that tells the tale of a young girl who just moved in to a new apartment with her parents.  However, this isn't just any apartment.  Coraline, being the independent, headstrong girl that she is, finds a small doorway that leads to a parallel universe, and after she ventures inside things get really odd.<br /><br />The blu-ray version of the film looks very good.  The amount of detail and color saturation is fantastic.  I don't think it looks quite as good as Corpse Bride, but it's about on par with The Nightmare Before Christmas.  The 3-D version of the film is fun to look at, for a while.  I couldn't watch the whole movie in 3-D because the included glasses were a strain on my eyes.  It does work though, and it's a novel addition to the package you're getting.  I just won't be watching the entire film that way.<br /><br />As a film, Coraline mostly works.  It's an interesting story, but it didn't totally grab me.  Perhaps children will get more out of it than I did.  I'm not sure it would be a good film for very young children (4 or 5 years old) to watch as some of the images could be scary.  I do believe that girls in the 8 to 12-year-old range will likely enjoy this film and identify with Coraline's character.
B000002H48|5.0|As I have these albums on vinyl LP, I was already familiar with the songs.  But, as I rarely, if ever, listen anymore to 'record albums', I had not heard what was on them for years and years until I ordered the CD's.    I had forgotten how much I liked the songs on the albums.    And while characteristics of the Artists' 'cause celebre' may have changed significantly, the value of the Artists' music has not decreased at all.
B000EAT246|3.0|\\"Blue Thunder,\\" a terrific whiz-bang action thriller anchored by John Badham's direction and the performances of Roy Scheider and a wonderfully slimy Malcolm MacDowell, suffers from what is now an unbearably tiresome Hollywood cliche: corrupt U.S. government and military officials.  What still seemed kinda fresh even a decade after Watergate is now so tiresome, overused, and annoying that it makes \\"Blue Thunder\\" a painfully outdated viewing experience.  Cliches get irritating after a while, so much so that they distract the viewer from appreciating a film's pure action-movie thrills.  Such is the case with \\"Blue Thunder\\": I loved it back in the 1980s, but I find it tedious and irritating today.
B001UV4XL0|5.0|Today we went to the theater to see the new David Twohy film \\"A Perfect<br />Getaway\\". I had been anticipating it for a while- It had Milla Jovovich<br />and Steve Zahn, two notoriously good actors, and it looked brutal and<br />fun. So we went to the cinema to go see it. And I walked out VERY<br />satisfied! At 98 minutes, A Perfect Getaway is a great mix of suspense,<br />dark comedy, action, and good acting!<br /><br />Two newlyweds named Cliff and Cydney go on their honeymoon in beautiful<br />Hawaiian mountains. They decide to backpacking to this beautiful beach,<br />Along the way they meet a couple, the guy's name is Nick and the Girl's<br />name is Giele. Nick is a former US Army officer, and Giele is a sweet<br />southern girl who has learned tricks for things like hunting. They go<br />along with them.<br /><br />However, there's two killers who have done killing on the same island,<br />and this causes many people to be worried. However, the four realize<br />the further they go, the closer they get to being maimed by the<br />killers...<br /><br />This is the perfect thriller, and hands down one of the best movies of<br />09. Twohy is a filmmaker I'm not fond of, I did NOT like either of the<br />Riddick films, and even more so, he's just not a great filmmaker in<br />general. But here he takes a simple concept and turns it into a<br />complex, multi-layered story that has the audience on the edges of<br />their seats for the 98 minute runtime.<br /><br />Halfway through, the film takes an interesting turn with a shocking<br />plot twist. Instead of just saving the twist until the end so it can be<br />OMGZ SHOCKING, it is revealed halfway through. Then we go and discover<br />how that twist is possible in a 10 minute B&W flashback that shows us<br />how it's possible. Even more so, for the first half we're worried for<br />one couple. Then after the twist, we're worried for the others. Rarely<br />ever has a good thriller ever done that. I earned new respect for Twohy<br />upon watching this happen, and it's part of what made me walk out of<br />the theater at the end going \\"Whoa, that was an effing good movie.\\"<br /><br />The film is not without it's dark comedy too. Don't let the trailer fool<br />you into thinking it's a brutal and ugly film that'll disturb you. It<br />has a good deal of dark comedy in it. It's done in the most subtle way<br />possible- it's not randomly placed, it's well placed. And the best<br />thing is, a lot of it happens in the horrible stuff. There are couple<br />scenes where we're not sure if we should be going \\"That's HORRIBLE!\\" or<br />just laughing our butts off. Very well done, and very effective too.<br /><br />So in short, without the stupid \\"Are you ROGUE?\\" logo before the film's<br />opening scene, I have not a single complaint about this movie. It was a<br />day at the cinema well spent, and definitely worth the 98 minutes. I<br />knew it was going to be good, but even then I was surprised by the<br />movie.

B001P5Q6FC|2.0|Look at it this way, Lamb of God has finally reached 2009, and has mastered their musical craft- The screaming, the heavy songs, the drop D tuning... we get it, you're Lamb of God, amnd unless you were in the band, you'd have to be insane to say that this album is their best, or anything new and different. In Mr. Censored's review of Indestructible by Disturbed, he used a similar comparison to the one I'm about to use- A hamburger. If you like hamburgers, you'll love this hamburger because it tastes like a hamburger and goes down like one. Problem is though, there's almost no substance and you, the listener, are left full, but with a stomach ache. LoG are better than that, they know how to write entertaining songs, they know they are a good band. Pretty much, this album is a classic case of when  an band goes through the motions, because their record label is calling them up and telling them to get back to the studio, because it's time to go on tour again. Oh yes, this is a LoG album. Not a new one, just another one.
0143038419|5.0|A lot of people have criticized this book for being too self-absorbed and narcissistic. But we are all self-absorbed, particularly in America. I think the book grabs at this 'modern condition' with a self-deprecating honesty, and is not afraid to lay its own self-absorption out on the table for all to see--which is, when you think about it, a brave thing to do. It's not easy to admit that you are depressed, self-critical, etc. etc. due to the very fear that people WILL think you are self-absorbed. But let's face it, we (nearly) all are. To me, this is what makes the book so enjoyable. I could secretly identify with many of the author's trials and tribulations...her spooling, anxiety-ridden mind reminded me a lot of my own. I could also identify with her fear of having children, especially given society's expectations. How brave to leave all that behind! Some might say, self-indulgent. But how many of us have secretly wished to do something similar, but been too afraid?     A lot of this book is focused on God. Although I couldn't really identify with this quest for God, being agnostic myself, I could certainly identify with Gilbert's quest for self-acceptance. In the book, the two are closely tied hand in hand. I have no problem with spiritualism etc. so long as it's religion for peaceful reasons. Having once been an athiest, I feel as I am getting older that I can be more open to other ideas, even spiritual ideas. And again, spiritualism is often criticized as being 'New Agey' and self-indulgent. But really, spiritualism is an attempt to open yourself up to others, and abandon the ego. It seems ironic that those who wish to do this often have too big an ego, but it makes sense too. Hampered by a too-dominant ego (again, not necessarily a bad thing), we clutch at those moments where we can give the self up to something bigger than ourselves (hence the American need for self-help, therapy, new-agey stuff etc.) For the author, that 'something' is God. But there's nothing wrong, I think, in this questing. For one person, it's Reiki, for another it's stocks and shares. We're all really after the same thing, in different ways. Why are we so quick to dismiss others for their beliefs/interests? (I get tons of stick for being vegetarian!).    What I found most admirable about the author was her ability for quickly and easily 'settling in' to her new environments, making friends, and treating them non-judgementally. Also, I don't think a narcissistic person would really be as empathic as the book proves that she is. Narcissists don't care about others, and are not sympathetic. This is evidently the opposite of Elizabeth Gilbert's personality- if anything, she cares too much about others and cannot detach herself from them.     My only reservation, as one reader already commented, was the lack of engagement with the 'real' Italy or India...the poorer side. But this was not intended to be a travel book so much as a self-discovery book...in this sense, she had no duty to explore that side of things, just as tourists don't. Let's face it, if we're trying to get over depression and misery, as she was, would we thrust ourselves into a depressing milieu?    One of my favorite things about the book is that it underscores the fact that life is a PERSONAL journey. We can't rely on self-help books, special diets, exercise routines, dogma etc. to make us happy. Each person needs different things, and should take different things...there's no set formula, or 'how to' for happiness    All in all, an inspirational read that makes me want to go out, have adventures, and sod life! (Perhaps the reason some people hate this book, is because the idea of doing this shakes their core, their life as they've built it. But to these people I say, 'be open.')
B000EF5NAS|5.0|I've watched this movie many times.  I have a vhs tape and wanted to upgrade to DVD.  I encourage my friends to see it so I can watch it again with them.  The acting was superb and it held my interest.  I'm sure I'll watch it again.

1423101472|5.0|I definitely recommend starting at the first book for anybody who's looking at these reviews who haven't read the rest of the series yet.  This one pretty much picks up where the fourth book left off, and doesn't lose time with explanations.  I began reading the Percy Jackson series because I missed having new Harry Potter books to read.  At first, I thought the two series had a lot of similarities (particularly, both Percy's and Harry's Achilles heel is the inability to turn away from friends in need, both being young male protagonists facing an evil lord of some type).  However, I kept reading through the series because I really began to enjoy the series and the characters on their own.  I was extremely excited to get my hands on the last book of the series, especially after the spectacular cliffhanger to the fourth one.    One thing I've really enjoyed about this series is that each book keeps getting better, in written quality, plot and character development.  However, even as things get more complicated and Percy grows up, the book doesn't stray from its original audience - kids and young adults.  Percy remains as easy to identify with in this last book as he did in the first book.  As the other books, The Last Olympian begins with a bang and has you turning pages until the very end, it's action-packed, throws in plot twists left and right, and has you really wishing the series didn't end.  Which, according to both the inclusion of a new prophecy at the end of the book and Riordan's acknowledgments, doesn't seem like it will - he mentions that this is the end to the first series for Camp Halfblood, so maybe we'll be seeing more demigod books soon!    I won't go into plot details here, as I don't want to spoil the fun for anyone, but I do have to say this - I was extremely impressed with Riordan's inclusion of Manhattan landmarks in this book.  It made the book seem so much more realistic, and made the scenes a lot more vivid.  Reading it almost felt like watching a movie, that's how real and well-timed the plot was.  Riordan also slips in some didactic lessons for the kids (and reminders for us adults as well), such as teamwork and compromise gets you places where you wouldn't be otherwise.  A superb, fine end to a great series!
0802798225|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I have started reading the Young Adult genre and found this author to be one of the best for this age group. I have read her other books and have liked this one the best so far. Can't wait for the next one.
0446581348|3.0|The latest Bobbi Brown make up book is touted as \\"for everyone from beginner to pro\\".  That, I think, is the biggest problem with this book -- a beginner and a pro need completely different types of tips, and this book tries to encompass a large audience without effectively delivering to either side.      First off, I expected this book to have more make up application tips.  She covers the extreme basics very well, but doesn't do much more than that.  I can understand this, as Bobbi Brown's style is more \\"natural\\", definitely not on the \\"wild\\" side.  But as a \\"manual\\", I wanted to know more of the complicated tips and tricks (also, since this is a book also for pros, you'd think that kind of stuff would be included).  I expected more tips on things like foundation/priming/blemishes and eye make-up (what about stuff like using mascara primer?  Shouldn't that be a suggestion for the sparse-lashed?).  Even her \\"advanced\\" section in the book, though filled with pictures, doesn't really give you the how-tos.  For supposedly being a comprehensive make-up manual, I thought there would be more on these vital parts.  She also doesn't cover more recent trends or techniques in make-up, which I found disappointing, since what's the difference between this book and just an update to her older volumes?  Also, she shows you a plethora of brushes, but doesn't go over when to use them in the actual how-to section.  Would I really need to buy 20+ brushes then?  One particular thing I found missing was false lashes.  She goes over how to put on individual small lashes, but didn't talk about strip lashes, which I find more convenient for the average user.  As another reviewer mentioned, I wish she had gone into more product recommendations.  I know those change with trends, and she probably didn't want to endorse any, but with thousands of products on the market, where does the novice even begin to choose what's good for them?  What about trends in \\"organic\\", natural make-up?  Productselection is a large part of the make-up process, and she could have covered how to select products better.    I appreciated the sections on diversity and make-up application tips for minorities, this was something I found slightly lacking in her first book.  Also liked the make-up artist biographies at the end, gave me a better idea of what the industry is like and its history.  I think what disappointed me the most was, Bobbi Brown's already written 3 books prior to this.  I thought this would go above and beyond, but it really didn't.  I think this book would have been better either split into two books (a beginner's book and a book for people looking to become pros), or a longer, more comprehensive volume.  As it is, I was disappointed -- this is a watered down version of a make-up manual.

B001PU8N0I|5.0|I must confess from the beginning that I have never read a Charles Dickens novel.  It was probably the Christmas Carol thing....over saturated from an early age.  I had no interest in reading his books.  I purchased the DVD series because Matthew MacFadyen was in it.  His surprising portrayal of Mr. Darcy in P & P 3, prompted me to seek out his other work, thus \\"Little Dorrit.\\"<br /><br />This story is an highly populated, intertwined, multi-layered, mystery thriller/love story.  It incorporates all the suspense of a mystery novel, with all the elements of a love story, along side the critical commentary of (could it be satire?) the inner-workings of socio-economic mores of 19th century England.<br /><br />A young girl, born in a debtor's prison, living along side her father there, finds employment with a recluse, wealthy, elderly woman who holds grudges and secrets.  Her only son, living abroad with his father, returns to England upon his father's death.  Disillusioned with the family business, as well as disturbed by his fathers' parting words, he seeks out his own employment and begins a quest to uncover a family mystery.  He meets the young girl at his mothers house and begins a journey of self-discovery that intercepts the lives of numerous persons that are all woven together and associated in some way.  It explores the true meaning of wealth and happiness in a moving and poignant way.  It forces you to think of contentment in ways not normally thought of, opening your eyes to the possibility of being satisfied with the lot you were given.  (who would have thought it?)<br /><br />This story is engrossing from the beginning.  And, although, there are numerous characters, each one is fully explored and you have a complete understanding of them.  Even minor characters have place and background in the large scheme of the story, and you never wonder who they are or why they are interjected into the storyline.  So complex and multi-layered is this story, it is confounding how uncomplicated it moves through to the end. It is never convoluted or confused.  Andrew Davies wrote the screenplay, and even though some of his interpretations fall short for me, this has to be one of his best films.<br /><br />The cast is phenomenal.  There is not one weak element among them.  The caliber of performance is astounding!!!  Such fine talent and all working well off of each other.  The characters are rich with depth and personality and the actors seamlessly portray them.<br /><br />There is comedy, social commentary, love, heartbreak, riches, poverty and riches, again.  Although a complicated mystery is evolving, the steady stream of subplots only enforce the storyline.<br /><br />This was well worth the money.  I have purchased the novel and will be plowing through it with great enthusiasm.  This was a pleasure and will be seen several times over as it takes a prominent place in my DVD collection.

B0027G783W|2.0|Moby has many different sounds. Between his albums, he's dipped into genres like ambient, chill, house, pop, and even rock. I wasn't sure what this album would sound like because you never know what he might come out with. I was really dissapointed to find out that this one sounds like a score to a serious dramatic movie. There's really no other way to describe this album. All the songs sound like they're from a heartbreaking scene from a love flick. Almost every song has very little drums and a dark, generic orchestra sound. If you love the upbeat moby albums, this one's far from that.

B001PJRAUS|4.0|What girl hasn't wished she could be Elizabeth and marry Darcy? It is funny how Darcy has become an icon for many girls. Lost in Austen is fun because it plays with this fantasy, and it manages not to be boring because it plays around with different possible outcomes than those of Austen's Pride and Prejudice. So for any girl who has loved P&P, this is a fascinating complimentary comedy. It is well worth a look.

B00164KYV4|1.0|With all this talent one would expect something great. After seeing many negative reviews, I hoped for at least something good, but got something dreadful. I kept trying to find something to like about this movie as I normally love Jen Anniston, but even she could'nt save this clunker. Her character, along with Affleck's, were the best out of the bunch. Theirs was the most genuine and realistic out of all the \\"love\\" situations. I found Goodwin's character absolutely obnoxious. Who in real life would be that insecure and needy? Any man in his right mind would run from that. Especially a womanizer who had his share of beautiful women and then he unknowingly falls for her afer she attacks him on the sofa? Gag me. As for the love triangle between Scarlett's character and two men, how cliche. Of course the femme fatalle would be played by a busty blonde. Then there is Connelly's portrayal of a pathetic wife who only snared her husband by giving him an ultimatum and then refusing to sleep with him. Upon finding out about is infidelity she accepts it quite calmly until she further discovers he is sneaking cigarettes. Sneaking sex is acceptable, but he could get lung cancer!!  Then there is Drew Barrymore's air-headed character of a modern day woman who can't figure out how to communicate with all the different technologies in today's world. I had to roll my eyes throughout much of this film as these women were a bunch of one dimensional, pathetic whiners made to look weak, needy and less than. Real women are not like this, at least the ones I know. Thank goodness.  What surprises me most is that all these A-list actors signed up for this vapid drivel in the first place. Musta have been a heck of a paycheck. I guess the moral of this film is that as a society we, as women, are programmed to believe that a man likes us if he treats us badly. Very highschool concept, most of us grow out of that. This film not recommended for intelligent women.

B0028K31CE|3.0|This CD is very average.  There are 4 song that are very good, 4 that are very bad and one instrumental that he should have kept off the CD all together. I guess after such a long layoff, I was expecting so much more from Maxwell.  My appreciation for his music is based on past performances.  This CD in my opinion was not even close to his efforts from the past. Now don't get me wrong; for an artist just getting started, this would be ok, but not for Maxwell.  I think that the hype was over blown and he didn't deliver a complete CD like he has in the past.  My only hope is that the Summer's & Night CD's are much better and reflect the talent that he has. Also, it would be nice to have more than 9 songs.  At least there's a better chance that I'll get more than 4 songs worth listening to...
B001NLL0RW|4.0|The Sigma series always reads like Indiana Jones with one daring escape after another.  James Rollins gives us a tale based on grains of truth, and then builds on it to create a great thrill ride. There are also the fascinating insights into history, architecture, other countries and cultures that add depth and believability to all his stories. Read this one straight through without stopping.
1932907009|5.0|I bought this book because I wanted to learn how to write a screenplay. There are several books out there that teach this skill, and I've read many of them. Save The Cat did it the best, though. The other great thing about this book is that it not only helps and inspires one to write a screenplay, but it helps one become a better writer in general--screenplay, essay, short story, or novel. It also shows the reader the amount of movie magic that exists before the CGI takes over.   I cannot write a review without mentioning what a great guy the author is, too. Have I met him? No. But, he does include his email address for you to email him your ideas. Now, here's the kicker: he actually responds. Not only did he respond to my email detailing several of my ideas, but he got back to me within the hour and had written more in response than I had written in my initial email. Very impressive.
0451209338|4.0|This is a good story - for the most part - the first in the Gabriel Allon series.  (You do not have to read them in the order written to enjoy them thoroughly.)<br /><br />The plot was actually quite simple, and the number of characters and the number of venues were (thankfully) kept to a minimum. Keep in mind that all the characters are severely damaged human beings, a result of the never-ending life-and-death struggle between Jews and Arabs, and while many are smart and beautiful, they make human mistakes of emotion and bad judgment.  No one in this book is unscathed by his or her own history.  See Italo Calvino's \\"If on a Winter's Night a Traveler\\" for an exposition on how one cannot escape one's past.<br /><br />Gabriel, the main guy, is an assassin re-recruited by Israeli Intelligence to carry out an assignment. As such he is mildly likable and considerably unlikable, all at the same time. Due to a tragedy that killed his son and permanently hospitalized his wife (who now resides in a psychiatric sanatorium) events for which he blames himself, Gabriel suffers from guilt and self-hatred, equal to the depth of his need for revenge against the one Palestinian who perpetrated the evil deed on his family. The psychological part of the story describes Gabriel's inability to move on, love again, and make himself whole. Thus, he is a complicated and maddeningly difficult man, whose skills are two: killing people and restoring art masterpieces. The boy Peel, at the story's beginning and at the end, is a great addition to the story and to the humanizing of Gabriel.<br /><br />There's a bit too much \\"I gotcha\\" at the end with revelations of a double agent, and the entire scenario in Montreal could have been totally slashed from the story with no loss whatsoever to the integrity of the story.<br /><br />As is common these days in books like this, there is TMI (too much information) about just about everything, thus resulting in a 486 page book when it should have been about 325 pages long.  See anything written by Alan Furst for tight, espionage thriller stuff. There is good tension and good pacing, however, but this book is NOT a \\"page-turner.\\"<br /><br />Jacqueline, the fem fatale, turns out to be interesting and fierce, but the situations Silva puts her in to further the story are somewhat contrived. In the end, she lacks the believability of the main male characters. There were times when over-the-top chauvinism and mild misogyny surfaced unnecessarily and irritatingly.<br /><br />Shamron, the key Israeli Intelligence Officer who masterminds the entire scenario, is a well-drawn character, ruthless and scheming, but rather neutral from a reader's perspective. He is shrewd and largely unpleasant.<br /><br />Now, the plot resolution: Naturally, since this is the first of a series, a lot of threads are left untied.  But, really, shouldn't a poor reader be tossed a morsel or two of final solution?<br /><br />Technically it's a 5, but from a readability standpoint it falls to slightly under a 4.  But, all-in-all, I liked the book. I just get a little tired of all the political preaching and \\"woe-is-me\\" hand-wringing - the Palestinians on one side and the Israelis on the other. Over time, it simply gets boring. At least Silva treats the geopolitical-religious-social dilemma with relative balance. This book is not necessarily simply a paean to the ultra-conservative right-wing apologists who want to kill anyone who does not \\"believe\\" as they do.written by Alan Furst for tight, espionage thriller stuff.

6304696558|3.0|Private Benjamin starring Goldie Hawn is a film I have tried to enjoy on many occasions - to this day I still feel this movie is missing something. This comedy isn't horrible but it isn't brilliant either. Hawn is a delightful actress but I just feel the premise and characters are a little far-fetched. The first half of the film is strong and the last hour - well I just seem to lose interest. If you want a great Goldie Hawn flick then check out Foul Play or Overboard. It's a mixed bag for me, sorry!
0307269981|4.0|As an author, Stieg Larsson is someone of whom you just cannot say enough good things about. Not only was his story telling unique in style, but in substance as well. His characters are fleshed out above and beyond a mere mystery. The plots of his stories are so complex and deep, that you get lost in them and once you are finished you look back in awe over the creation.<br /><br />I don't know enough about the life and early death of Stieg Larsson. All I know is that the first two of the three books he left to be published comprise what can only be considered to be one of the all time classic mystery/thriller genre book series.<br /><br />Once again we are given the admirable character of Mikael Blomkvist as a protagonist. The story starts off with him and his familiar cast of Milennium Magazine getting ready to publish an expose on the sex trade of Sweden. We are also re-acquainted with Salander, a quite introvert genius (negative note #1, Larsson is falling into an old trap where the author falls in love with his characters. Salander is morphed here in this second installment from a simpler character into one with almost super-hero qualities which instead of setting her apart, instead makes her feel almost like a character based on a Marvel comic book.)<br /><br />Ok, so you know that I love Larsson, love the characters, and I even really enjoyed the story. Why would I give this book only 4 stars then??? Well, this is based on purely personal reasons for the most part. I am a reader who hates jumping from character to character, and the more characters who find themselves in the roll of first person, the more I hate the story. However, \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\" relies upon this trick more heavily than just about any other novel I have ever read. Larrson writes in nice short chapters, and they are always seen through someone different eyes. I bet I could go back and dig up 30 different first person studies. Larsson, great writer that he is, still manages to avoid the most common flaws here and pulls it off better than most. It was just a lot more bumpier of a read than it needed to be.<br /><br />Perhaps most egregious, Larsson plays with the plot, suspense and arc of the story by mashing all of the story lines into one convergence. I am not giving anything away here because this information can be found on the books dust jacket. We are following Salander along quite nicely. Once she is accused of the triple murders, she flees and the story forgets her. Alot of what thus ensues could have been answered quickly if we had only stayed in her head and not started to jump all around from character to character.<br /><br />Or perhaps I could put it this way... Larsson falls back on a lazy mans writing trick by jumping from one persons mind to the next. He fills in gaps and keeps the story moving along this way. However, the most important bits surrounding Salander, Larsson goes the opposite route and keeps these moments hidden from the reader. Thus giving a very false sense of urgency and suspense. I can't forgive him for trashing the novel so heavily with this ploy. The rest of the writing structure and style would definitly merrit 5 stars, but...laws here and pulls it off better than most.

B001FB4W0W|2.0|I just cannot get into this show. I've seen the entire first season and the first episode of the second season and I've given up. Whether or not the show is purposely trying to come off as poorly written and poorly acted is irrelevant. It is poorly written and it is poorly acted. If that's the point, then we shouldn't be watching it in the first place. Alan Ball is talented no doubt, but he's not on point here. He's lucky that so many people are obsessed with vampires at the moment - Six Feet Under was a solid production, solid like [....], but True Blood? Nah.

0765356147|1.0|Ok.  Vin and Elend march an army to an unfriendly city, and, once there, use their Mistborn powers to infiltrate it to go to a ball being thrown by the enemy king.  Surrounded by enemies, with the potential for intrigue high, it turns into an internal monologue about how much Vin likes herself.    And that's pretty much all you need to know about Hero of Ages.    Why these Mistborn books are rated so highly is beyond me.  The first one was ok.  The latter two...hundreds of pages of repetative angst and introspection interspersed with a few well written action sequences.  Pacing is abominable, because the story is constantly being interrupted with yet more introspection which is covering the same ground that the previous introspection did.    Once Sanderson learns how to actually tell a story and not get bogged down in over developing his characters, he might be force to reckon with.  Until then, I'd recommend the latter two books to teenaged girls who want to read about how \\"dreamy\\" (and yes, Vin DID use this word to describe him) Elend is.

B000VNMMQG|5.0|This is the story of one man on a mission to end the English slave trade.<br /><br />William Wilberforce (Ioan Gruffudd) was an English member of parliament in the late 18th and early 19th century.  He had a Christian experience and was led to eliminate the abomination of slavery.  Although he was a person of extraordinary wealth and privilege, Wilberforce was driven to do the right thing.<br /><br />This movie is a testament to the power that a single person who is focused can have.  In addtion to the protagonist, there are outstanding performances by John Newton (Albert Finney), Barbara Spooner (Romola Garai) and William Pitt (Benedict Cumberpatch).<br /><br />It took far too long for me to get around to seeing this one.  It is one that I would not mind seeing again and I can heartily endorse it for anyone who loves an inspirational story.  It is also a good history lesson and just plain great entertainment.

Not as smoky as Madeleine in her vocals, she is closer to Nora but the fact that she writes the bulk of her own music and she makes it all sound so easy just makes you smile. She isn't known in the States and that needs to change. Too many are missing out on this European star.    This is a \\"Best of...\\" type of CD which is surprising since she only has 3 CD's out and hasn't reach a quarter century in age. But regardless of that, or because of that, this is a CD I'm glad I took a chance on purchasing. \\"This is the Closest Thing To Crazy\\" opens the CD and harks back to jazz of the 40's. It is just plain good and sounds like you've heard it before - for the first time. As I mentioned, \\"Nine Million Bicycles\\" is just pure passion. \\"What a Wonderful World\\" is a remake which is a little slower and easy than Louis' version but it works. \\"If You Were a Sailboat\\" is full of sensuality and a tune you can't wait to hear again.    A great voice and great CD.
0307269981|4.0|Excellent follow up to \\"dragon tattoo\\" - my only complaint is that the story line from Grenada didn't seem to connect to the rest of the book. Nonetheless, Lisbeth is fascinating and I can't wait for the final book next year.
1439157383|5.0|Picoult has written some good novels but has always had a problem with her endings. This time she has written a great novel and the ending was perfect.
1416550534|3.0|While the ending was certainly exciting, I struggled to maintain interest for the first 400+ pages. \\"The Forgotten Garden\\" was much better in my opinion.
B001MYIQFE|5.0|First let me comment on the Audio Fidelity issue of this album:  Oh...this sounds fantastic.  I don't understand the many complaints, so I felt the need to throw down, and give props.  Excellent sound quality.  I love it!  Rich, smooth, clear and crisp.  Sparkling highs and perfectly balanced bass.  Everything sounds wonderfully balanced.  Even.  Fantastic!  I don't have any other versions to compare...but I'm familiar enough with early CDs: anemic, thin sound, missing frequencies...and CDs of late:  awfully loud, frequency overload, balance-challenged, ear-pain. As well, I'm familiar with early 80s recordings...of which this is, and I've never heard one sound this wonderful.  This is absolute ear candy!  Smooooooth!!!  The synths sound great and there's so much wonderful stereo play.  I don't think any fan of this album would be disappointed.  It helps to have a nice setup...on a great headphone getup like I've got going right now...this is marvelous.<br /><br />Now, the album.  It's really good.  I think it's my favorite Cars album.  I'm not a Cars expert...but I love this album.  Sorry...back to the sound...the bass on \\"Heartbeat City...here we come!\\"  Is just delicious.  I could slice it up and serve it for supper!  You can hear everything going on,...which is quite a lot: synths going round, guitars, vocals popping in and out.  Diggin' it.  But what a great album...I'm actually sad when it ends, because it's so addictive and good sounding and good feeling.  But I can just play it again.  Four times in a row, thus far!  That's insane.  I don't know when I've EVER done that.  5 biggie-size stars for the mastering and for the album.<br /><br />Spin number 5....\\"Hello!  Hello again...\\"
B000EHSVS2|5.0|What a truly excellent film! I remember seeing 'Patton' some years ago for the very first time and being instantly struck by how great it was. The movie inspired me to read as much material on General George S. Patton as I could. Patton the man and the film our two of my favorite things.    George C. Scott really had the role of a lifetime here. He does not fumble the opportunity. He nails the part to perfection. One of the only differences between the two men was that Patton had a higher pitched voice. As his biographer Carlo D'Este once said, \\"Patton would have loved to have a voice like George C. Scott's.\\" Scott's Patton is funny, mean, tough, fair, and moving. His portrayal of Patton's rage at the battle fatigued soldier is excellently played as is his stunned reaction at being put in the doghouse. His admission for his love of war over a smoking battlefield is a classic. Scott is great and he carries the picture. Karl Malden is a good foil for Patton as the legendary Omar Bradley. His Bradley seemed to me to be a little nicer than the actual Bradley was but it works for the movie. Oddly, Eisenhower is not depicted in the movie but his presence is felt throughout.     You are riveted by this film from the beginning to the end. The entrance of Scott at the opening of the movie is one of the great introductions to a movie character in all of cinema.    The DVD contains good picture and sound plus some interesting documentaries especially the 'History vs. Hollywood' that explains some of the creative licenses that were taken in the film.    Highly recommended!
B000OJFV3S|5.0|I am so addicted to this show...the costumes, the horses, the KING!  Very historical, yet sexy...a history lesson for adults!  I cannot wait for more!
B001DPHDCY|3.0|Great price and fast service. Product condition not as good as desribed but still watchable. A really good movie for chilren. I would recommed it.
B001CZVVUU|5.0|I have had a laserdisc copy of this opera on the shelves for many years but never managed to get past the first act so this BD was my first exposure to the complete opera.<br />A movie with a relatively thin story line succeeds because of the artistic ability of the actors just as one with a strong story line can fail because of poor acting.  A successful operatic production requires just so much more with great acting, great singing, great music and great staging because most have rather thin story lines.  Well this production of Manon has it all and I did not find the modern setting used by Staatskapelle at all inappropriate.  The balance between voices and orchestra is fine as is the audio and video generally.<br />Now I must confess to a love affair with  Anna Netrebco as her beautiful & powerful voice combined with stunning good looks have me completely captivated so be aware of this prejudice.  But combine her talents with those of Rolando Villazon with the music of Massenet and you have a winner here.  Their singing and acting brought tears to my eyes.  What more can be said?  Unreservedly recommended.
B001C3KCSY|1.0|I am willing to buy a CD from a band I don't know based on word of mouth.  This CD was just such a purchase, I actually bought it the week it was released.  I've listened to it both in the car and at home and now it is collecting dust with the worst of my music collection.      Personally it is not for me.  Everything sounds muddy, from the vocals to the instruments.  Thank god I put together a great sound system so this CD can make it sound terrible.  I love punk rock so don't misunderstand me, loose playing is not the problem, but computer manipluation and sound filtering to make songs sound good over Applebees PA system is not for me.  Also the lead singer wines every word, it sounds like the singer from Nickelback covering REM while a high school talent show band that just discovered a distortion peddle backs him up.
B000HEWEEE|3.0|The Lake House is a science fiction romance of two people separated by two years in time, but communicate with letters.  The letters are left in a mailbox at the Lake House where they both reside at different times.  The mailbox is the worm hole to both the past and future.  The first letter is from Dr. Kate Forster (Sandra Bullock) to the new occupant Alex Wyler (Keanu Reeves) asking him to forward her mail if any is missed by the post office and the paw prints at the front door were there when she moved in.  She loved the house as she felt relief from stress there.  Alex also feels deeply about the house as his father (Christopher Plummer) designed and built it.<br /><br />Alex noted a stray dog left paw prints, but after the note from Dr. Forster.  He puts a letter in the mailbox asking how she could have known about this.  That is how the communication connects even though they are separated in time by two years.  Alex dates his letters 2004 and Kate dates hers 2006.<br /><br />The movie whipsaws you between time and also confusion on how the movie finally ends.  The threads of the premise do not make sense and this is obvious in the ending scenes.<br /><br />If the viewer can take the leap of faith on time travel and changing destiny you will have a good time watching.
0307269981|5.0|I'm not going to recount the plot. I'm going to comment on the quality of the writing, the plot and character development. The first chapter is a grabber and doesn't let you go until about page 50, when you can think about something else other that the disturbing first few pages. Those pages haunt you as you continue to read past the first chapter. It's an explosive way to start a book. Even as the grip on your mind ebbs, the plot is so strong that you can't stop turning the pages. This book never really lets up...well, there's one slow piece that would be great in any other book but slows down the action here (when Lisbeth re-enters the story) because the pace is so fast-paced.<br /><br />Larsson doesn't hit a wrong note as far as his literary abilities. The characters are real, the dialogue strong and real sounding, and the plot is plausible and very intricate.<br /><br />I can't wait to read the next book. A wonderful writer. A true piece of great, entertaining, fun literature.
B00005BKZJ|5.0|I'm one of those people who doesn't like sci-fi, fantasy, silly romances, most comedy. I like drama. And don't give me obvious humor and expect me to laugh. I don't like weirdness much, either. I like things straight-forward.    I refer to this movie as \\"The weirdest movie I like\\" and when I've gotten others to watch it, they liked it, too. It's on the cusp of mainstream and artsy. Most importantly, it's very UNDERSTANDABLE and entertaining. Give it a shot.
B000FC1192|5.0|At first I was like this book is oka.  When I got farther in I was like wow I wonder what I would do if I were in her position.  It made me realize that I sort fo take all the earth for granted when this is like the only place in the universe that lets us live and explore without goimg nto nothingess. Gaiman writes so he keeps you wondering what will happen next and leaves the thrills witnin you through each word
B000A2RRF4|5.0|Absolutely and wholly eminent!  When he was doing this concert I was one year old so of course I didn't get to see him live, but this is the next best thing.  And all along the only thing that I could think of was \\"WOW\\" my mouth dropped when the concert began, and I couldn't halt smiling.  Michael is a phenomenon himself, and this concert is utterly phenomenal!     Then at the end of the DVD I begin to sense a loneliness and a profound feeling of melancholy, simply because I know that we will never see him again performing, and noone will EVER achieve that congruous greatness he delivered. He was truly blessed.    Truly one of a kind.
B00164KYV4|3.0|Ginnifer Goodwin always seems to play the girl who can't get (or keep) a man.  Witness her turns in Mona Lisa Smile and as the jilted first Mrs. Cash in Walk the Line.  Where does this typecasting come from?  Because Ms. Goodwin is absolutely adorable.  She does it again here, as the adorably named and (increasingly) desperate Baltimore single Gigi who wonders why promising first dates and bar conversations never lead anywhere.  Answer:  She's obsessing WAY too much.  Gigi works in the same office with Beth (Jennifer Aniston), whose live-in boyfriend (Ben Affleck) is marriage-phobic; and Jeanine (Jennifer Connelly) an uptight control freak married to a guy (Bradley Cooper) who's had ample time to regret being pushed into marriage with her.  So much so that his eye wanders to buxom (and easy) yoga instructor Anna (Scarlett Johansson) who hits on him in the supermarket.  Memo to Ms. Johansson:  We get it.  You are a sexpot.  You are also in danger of becoming a parody of yourself.  Oh, wait--that's already happened.  Anna is friends-with-benefits with Conor (Kevin Connelly) who had one date with Gigi and is not that into her. Rounding out the cast is ad salesgirl Mary (Drew Barrymore) and wise bartender Alex (Justin Long), who counsels Gigi to behave more like a guy and not take it all so personally.  Apart from observing that Long is nowhere near as appealing here as he is as Mac in the Mac/PC commercials, he and Barrymore grated on my nerves the least.  Then, Barrymore is barely in the movie.  I think I counted three scenes that made it into the film.  The rest is all very angsty, Thirtysomethingesque, except that all of these people are too self-involved to have children.  One wonders how a nonfiction self-help book evolved into a 'romantic comedy' (in quotes, because there's not much that's either romantic or funny here) with all these different storylines.  A bit more entertaining than I was expecting it to be, which is faint praise, maybe, but that's all I got.Women can take away the one salient lesson they need to learn, though:  When he's just not that into you, the signs are clear.  As crystal.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|I am so blithe that I finally, at last receive my order in the mail yesterday!<br />I couldn't be more gleeful.<br />And nothing in it disappoint me, the DVD was spectacular. Michael bestow an stupendous, preeminent performance.<br /><br />The unreleased songs should have been release in my opinion, it's that awesome.<br /><br />Watching the DVD really brings tears to my eyes knowing we'll never see another performance from him again, and no other performance that will achieve that greatness.<br /><br />Please do yourself a favour and buy it!<br />It's well worth the price.
1577311523|2.0|I found this book to be repetitive and a little flaky. There were a few \\"takeaways\\" for me but generally speaking, not that great.  The quest for heightened awareness and spirituality is a good one, but this book did little to get me there.

B002E2QHBS|4.0|Wow!  As a stand-alone overview,this is a fantastic release.<br /><br />Six discs crammed (almost 8 hours-still only 1/5 of all the music) with exciting music from great artists.  An 80 page large-format book,filled with wonderfully printed color and b&w photographs from the festival.  A written introduction by producer Andy Zax,who originally wanted to release all the music from Woodstock-on 30 discs.  And notes by Bud Scoppa detailing events over the three days and the era in general.  There is a set list of the performers,and who played what instrument in this collection,and a complete list in chronological order of all the performers/songs played at Woodstock.<br /><br />There's great unreleased music from artists (COUNTRY JOE AND THE FISH,Tim Hardin among others) heard on previous Woodstock releases.  But listeners,finally,get to hear people/groups (the great Bert Sommer,THE GRATEFUL DEAD),plus,full-length versions of already released  songs,and authentic sets (MOUNTAIN,Ravi Shankar) not heard on past releases-all in improved sound.  The tracks have been remastered and are clean and crisp-yet still retain their original warmth and immediacy.  Another plus is that the performances are heard in the original order as experienced at the three day festival.  This brings listeners closer to what actually happened,which gives this collection even more weight.<br /><br />Combine all this with Max Yasgur's complete speech to \\"the kids\\",Abbie Hoffman's attempt at politicizing the crowd and THE WHO's Pete Townshend's words to that attempt,the sometimes humorous yet very atmospheric stage announcements and sounds from the festival,and it all adds up to a stunning collection.<br /><br />The packaging is similar to Rhino's hardcover \\"Love Is The Song We Sing:S.F. Nuggets 1965-1970\\" release from awhile back,except the discs are snapped in,inside the front and back covers.  The book is slipped into its own inside cardboard pocket.  INSIDE the pocket is a color picture of a Yasgur's dairy box and on the other side,a quote.  All in all,a pretty good presentation.<br /><br />Yes,there's a lot of previously released music here.  THE BAND,TEN YEARS AFTER,and THE KEEF HARTLEY BAND are not represented.  And once in a while the mix isn't as perfect (Arlo Guthrie's \\"Coming Into Los Angeles\\",CREEDENCE CLEARWATER REVIVAL) as some listeners might wish.  But what listeners do have is a collection of good,important,,exciting music from some of the greatest bands/performers of the era.  Artists who came together to create one of the most important,far-reaching,musical events in our history.  Something which can never be repeated.<br /><br />Forget nostalgia.  Sit back and listen to this still vital music.  It has the power to set your feet moving and put a smile on your face.  And that's a sure sign of good music.  With this collection,\\"Woodstock nation\\" still lives.<br /><br />P.S.  As of today (08/11/09) I notice that Amazon is no longer selling this set.  So if you're thinking of purchasing it-don't wait.  Maybe in this instance \\"limited edition\\" actually means what it says.

031606792X|5.0|The author drew out the story a bit near the end making it a bit long winded, however, I still really enjoyed it.  I hope that Stephanie decideds to continue the Saga or begin a new one with the same characters in this book!!!!!!  I must say after reading some of the other's reviews, I agree that this book was obsurd in many ways, but remember, we are reading about teenage vampires!  It is a silly story, not real life...  I enjoyed the story for what it was, even though it is true it could have concluded in a better way as some of you have stated in the review section.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|This is a perfect reminder for the kind of performer that he truly was.  Its amazing to see the reactions of the crowd as well.  This is a must for all those who want to live the experience of Michael Jackson.  Makes me sad to watch but I feel like I have a piece of him sitting in my cd rack.  You will never be disappointed as long as you own it!
B002JM1VJG|5.0|Besides Michael Jackson (may he rest in peace) there was no other artist besides Madonna that is as controversial, world-renowned, successful as a solo entertainer and known for not only her formative and innovational music-videos but for helping to invent the entire music-video genre, while also putting MTV on the map at the same time. With the appearance in her first music-video in 1980 (dancing backup to Patrick Hernandez in his club classic, the disco sensation \\"Born to Be Alive\\") over the last 30 years Madonna has appeared in more music-videos than any other entertainer, singer, performer, mother, woman, human being and dancing-queen. Through her videos Madonna not only defined a generation but also caused her viewers to question their own existence, importance and relevance. What child of the MTV generation does not remember the Madonna video marathons that they used host on a nearly monthly basis? Her videos were and are fascinating because like the star herself, they were all highly produced, over-the-top, dramatic, beautiful, sexy and very enigmatic.     Madonna has been the reigning Queen of Pop for 26 years (her debut album \\"Madonna\\" came out in the summer of '83) and Warner Bros. Records has decided to release this 2 disc DVD set, aptly titled \\"Celebration\\" in conjunction with Madonna's greatest hits CD by the same title. It's hard to believe that the most successful female entertainer in the entire world who has had more music-videos in rotation on MTV than any other artist only has 2 other video compilations (1990's \\"The Immaculate Collection\\" and the considerably less in your face, \\"The Video Collection 93:99\\" that came out at the end of the 20th century.) \\"Celebration\\" is a much needed shot of dance, entertainment and fun for both Madonna's gaggle of fans and for the casual listener of popular dance.     \\"Celebration\\" will include some of Madonna's most nonpareiled, short form music-videos. These videos are exclusive to this collection, having neverbeen released on any other Madonna compilation yet:   1. Into The Groove   2. Who's That Girl   3. True Blue   4. Justify My Love  5. Erotica  6. American Pie   7. Music   8. Don't Tell Me   9. What It Feels Like for a Girl   10. Day Another Day   11. Hollywood   12. Love Profusion   13. Hung Up   14. Sorry   15. Get Together   16. Jump   17. 4 Minutes   18. Give It 2 Me   19. Miles Away   19. Celebration     Years ago the status symbol that said that pop stars had arrived was getting their video banned from MTV. It not only showed that they were not afraid to write their own rules, but it also showcased an entirely new form of art that everyone wanted to take part in. Today, about the only thing that these no-talent celebrities can do is walk around without any undergarments on and hope that their picture gets up on the net.     Although her \\"Papa Don Preach\\" video was very controversial for its time (because to some it polarized teen pregnancy, while others felt that she was not giving \\"modern\\" girls of the '80s the right to choose) MTV did not ban it. Instead, the music-video peaked at #1 all over the world and became Madonna's very first video single. In 1989 with the release of \\"Like a Prayer\\" Madonna almost got her long overdue wish. Although it was not banned in the US (MTV showed it every hour and every day for more than 3 consecutive months), it was banned on state-run Italian TV. Her next video, \\"Express Yourself\\" was at the time the most expensive short form ever produced. In this musical film we can see Madonna crawling on a floor, making love to a factory worker, pouring a white viscous liquid over her shoulder and watching a group of half naked men fight for her affections. However she didn't get her first banned video until the following year with \\"Justify My Love.\\"     For \\"Justify My Love\\" Madonna booked up an entire floor at Parisian hotel to host a lavish sex orgy on film. Nothing was off limits, taboo, too risky or too vivid for the imagination.When the video was banned Madonna got Warner Video to release it onto home-video, making it the most successful video single in the entire history of the world while simultaneously making shop-lifters out of 10 year-olds all over the world who wanted to sneak a peak at this racy video. On the night of the premiere of \\"Erotica\\" MTV showed an entire block of Madonna videos, complete with trivia and news about her upcoming record and book of se'Xx'ual fantasies. When the video premiered at midnight Kurt Lorder introduced it saying, \\"What you are about to see is the music-video by arguably the most famous person in the world, this video depicts sexual acts between consenting adults. Some are not bothered by this, others are repelled by this. That is why MTV is not showing this video during regular rotation.\\"     Throughout the mid '90s Madonna produced a core of extraordinarily cutting edge videos that are perhaps some of the very best of her entire career. In \\"Take a Bow\\" we see a thought-out love story involving a woman of the '40s and a Spanish bullfighter, the plot picked up a year later with Madonna's follow-up video \\"You'll See.\\" In \\"Bedtime Story\\" Madonna takes us all on futuristic trip inside her mind. She shows her frustration in \\"Human Nature\\" and her softer side in \\"I Want You,\\" \\"You Must Love Me\\" and \\"Love Don't Live Here Anymore.\\" Perhaps one of Madonna's most mesmerizing videos of the '90s was her second VHS single, \\"Ray of Light\\" which also became one of her many signatures hits.     In the very first time of her career, Madonna used fast moving cinematography that showcased her darker side and caused some to wonder why she had so much anger and rage built up in \\"What It Feels Like for a Girl.\\" After MTV showed the video once and then withdrew it from their regular rotating schedule Madonna released it as a video single (her second DVD single, since the avant-garde \\"Music\\"). Three years later in another first, Madonna showed a sense of decency, contrite and even respect by choosing to withdraw \\"American Life.\\" Again Madonna's driving factor is no longer sexual imagery and personal fantasy, but rage, degradation and violence. In this clip Madonna skyjacks a fashion show as she holds everyone hostage. When the video was edited and redistributed to music channels around the US many were stunned. This time because Madonna wasn't nearly as outrageous or offensive or vulgar as before (she was only seen singing in front of an array of international flags).     Madonna went back to her roots in \\"Hung Up,\\" performing in a retro pink leotard in a dance studio. She played the same part in the video that followed (\\"Sorry\\") which was again shocking for many to see. Not because Madonna was obscene or vulgar or undressing for the camera. This time no one could believe how youthful Madonna appeared, like she were 20 years younger. But no matter what she does, has done or will do Madonna shocks; it's a habit!     Recently I had the pleasure of speaking with a very successful entertainer and one of the most famed VJ's who was on MTV during the height of Madonna's popularity. We spoke about a lot of things but mostly about why Madonna's managed to remain so influential over the years. It is because like MTV, Madonna knew how to change with the times and \\"re-invent\\" herself with each passing year as her audience of listeners and viewers also changed. Unlike a host of other superstars of the past, Madonna learned early on that if she wanted to remain important and on the cutting edge she would have to keep her finger on not only what's commercial and what's successful but also on what's the biggest and the best. And, over the last several years since MTV stopped showing music-videos Madonna has even transcended a network that once encompassed her.     Madonna has done it all. She's been everything from a hooker to a missionary. And her videos have depicted all of her personas, nuances, fads, fashion transgressions, inner demons and retrogressions. So many of us idolized Madonna because she was the voice for the voiceless. We identified with her because not only was she speaking her mind honestly and artistically through her music and her videos, but she was also pushing the envelope in both an artistic and nonconforming manner. Who else besides Madonna could make it cool to sing on a traditional gondola, perform in a peep show, dance in front of burning crosses, show a close-up of a deceased person's stitched mouth, be chained to a bed, throw a grenade at the most powerful man in the free world or go hitchhiking in the nude?     No one else has that blatant nerve or inner desire to not only top herself, but to exceed the expectations of all of her contemporaries and protractors. They say fame is a very fleeting thing, but Madonna's legacy will live on forever, immortalized in her music-videos.
B001BPJJ82|5.0|This film is often highly praised for it's beautiful colors and amazing cinematography, but every single piece of this movie is fantastic. I would recommend reading about how this movie was shot and the dedication that went into this movie. It was shot in 18 countries on 35 locations over 4 years...this movie was not just thrown together to tell a story...it was created. It was created in such a real way that while all the hospital sequences were being shot everyone on set thought the lead was actually a parapalegic. The story being told between the man and the girl is beautiful because the director gave them a direction and let them go with it...you can hear the man ask the child \\"what\\" many times throughout the movie because he genuinely could not understand her. One of the most brilliant films ever created by the greatest most creative director i have ever seen. Tarsem is amazing!
B000093OUA|5.0|Gary's 1980's rock output was getting stale by the end of the decade; \\"After The War\\" sounded an awful lot like \\"Out In The Fields\\"... Gary needed a new inspiration, and found it with the blues, his first musical love back in late 60's Ireland.<br />Assembling a top-flight rhythm section and a kick-ass horn section, Gary-along with some famous friends-made this modern-day blues / rock masterpiece.<br /><br />\\"Movin' On\\" is a Moore original that kick starts this collection, and features excellent slide guitar from Gary.<br />\\"Texas Strut\\" is Gary's salute to Billy Gibbons, Stevie Ray Vaughan & Albert Collins. A stompin' Texas-style shuffle, that features Gary's Fender Stratocaster being thrashed mercilessly-smokin' stuff.<br />\\"Midnight Blues\\" is a moody blues ballad made for when the lights are low.<br />\\"King of the Blues\\" is Gary's biographical tale of Albert King, and follows similar chord changes to King's \\"Born Under a Bad Sign\\".<br />\\"Still Got the Blues\\"-the title cut-is another wonderful ballad, which features Gary's Les Paul guitar in all it's nuances; sweet and warm during the verses, and mean and nasty during the solos.

B000002KDS|5.0|even after 35 years die-hard alice fans still argue over which alice cooper album is the best - proving that alice's music touches people on a very personal level. about the only thing they probably do agree on is that the alice cooper group belong in the rock and roll hall of fame (true) and alice the solo artist hasn't made a decent album since \\"welcome to my nightmare\\" (not true). while we all hold our breath for a long overdue reunion, we can take comfort in the fact that @61, alice still performs most of his classics on tour and with each new studio release proves that he at least still has a sense of humor.    on their fourth release, cooper returns with a vengeance. \\"killer\\" is the heaviest of the alice cooper band albums and considered their best by most die-hard fans. although the inclusion of horns on \\"under my wheels\\", \\"be my lover's\\" doo wop vocals and strings on \\"desperado\\" may have new fans a little confused, this is one great non-stop rock and roll album.    the entire band pushes themselves to another level, especially neal smith and dennis dunaway, providing a great bottom end for alice's gritty vocals. the album has a good range of songs including two hit singles; \\"under my wheels\\" (usually the encore in all alice shows to this day) and \\"be my lover\\", probably the best single michael bruce has ever written. the album has two solid rockers; \\"you drive me nervous\\" and \\"yeah, yeah, yeah\\" (guest guitarist rick derringer) but once again it is the deeper cuts that steal the show. \\"halo of flies\\" is an incredible progressive rock studio jam and with \\"dead babies\\", an instant classic was born. it was so popular there were even dead baby jokes. alice had said it is \\"the band's most misunderstood song\\" but of course, beheading baby dolls with a bloody hatchet in concert probably had something to do with that.    the \\"killer\\" tour also introduced a brand new set with plenty of nasty props including the towering gallows. the band beat and hung alice nightly aspunishment for his evil crimes to the delight of fans worldwide. roxy music opened for alice in the uk. -- set list: instrumental intro/be my lover/you drive me nervous/yeah, yeah, yeah/i'm eighteen/is it my body/halo of flies/dead babies/killer/long way to go/under my wheels    released november 1971 it reached #21 usa and #27 uk -- singles: under my wheels b/w desperado (#59) - be my lover b/w yeah, yeah, yeah (#49)    every alice cooper album has great songs that never made radio. its not the hits but the deeper cuts that are the real black beauties... blinddog pick: dead babies / killer / halo of flies
0316017922|3.0|Naturally a similar writing style from \\"Made to Stick\\". It had it's catch all points. Nothing earth shattering, but easy reading
B001UREJWM|1.0|I don't ~want~ to slam this album. I'm a fan of Black Sabbath, whether with Ozzy or Ronnie James Dio, (and Dio on his own, for that matter), and thought Black Sabbath's \\"Heaven & Hell\\" album was excellent. It's very disappointing, then, to eagerly buy this album and listen to dreary, dull, boring, aimless sludge. No catchy riffs, nothing that rates more than a second listen to confirm how empty it was the first time through. Maybe they can do better next time around, but I'll be checking the samples beforehand.
0312983867|5.0|Ranger fans will love this new edition to the Stephanie Plum series!  I think this is the best book so far and it shows a human side of Stephanie... This book strays from the bounty hunting a bit when Stephanie decides to help her parents neighbor Mabel on her search for her daughter, Evelyn and granddaughter, Annie.  Ranger and Stephanie's relationship evolves and this book is so entertaining.  Valerie,Stephanie's sister is also in this book.    Although Ramirez is dead, his owner is still alive and no I am not talking about Jimmy Alpha.      Read it!!!!!
0312323867|5.0|I accidently read this book before I read something borrowed, and couldn't put it down!!! I don't even like to read but this book was amazing. I have since read all Emily Giffin's books and still think this is by far the best one! MUST READ..even for people who hate reading (like me)!
B000KGGIQY|4.0|I am reviewing this nicely done commercial effort to delve into parts of the lives of the legendary singers Johnny Cash and his (eventual) wife June Carter Cash (of the famous mountain music Carter Family bloodlines. Her mother was the incredible vocalist and guitarist Maybelle Carter) in reverse order. Although I saw the this film for the first time when it was released in theaters (and have viewed it several times on DVD) several years ago I am reviewing now after having just seen the real Johnny Cash and June Carter on one of the segments of Pete Seeger's black and white television programs from the mid-1960s, \\"Rainbow Quest\\" where they appeared.  And knocked me, and I think Pete, over with their renditions of Carter Family material and information about that clan.    Okay, here is the skinny. If you want to get the glamorous, sexy romance and a fetching June Carter (Reese Witherspoon), the heartache and longing of pain in the butt Johnny Cash and the eventual joining together of two great musical talents story then this is the place to start. But, if you want the reason why this film was made in the first place, the legendary musical talent, warts and all, then watch them go through their paces along with old Pete Seeger. Both are worth the time.
B000003CMB|5.0|Someone once rated this concert as the greatest live recording ever.  In most cases such a claim is laughable, but of course in this case they are pretty close to the mark here...!    Along with the Rolling Stones \\"Get Your Ya Yas Out\\" and Cream's \\"Wheels of Fire\\" - ABB \\"At Fillmore East\\" is one of 'the CLASSIC' live recordings of the 20th Century.    The Allmans were the semnial southern band and spawned so many other good and not so good sucessors.  Their craft was in jamming and inprovision, but not the egotistical speed merchants out to show off (like the latter so called virtuso guitar players, espcially those who arrived on the scene during the 1980s) - these guys were striking, but at the same time subtle - blending light and shade to weave an amazing tapestry of sound.  (It is worth noting that they cite the much underated Lonnie Mack as a key influence).  Their brand of southern rock is a blend of blues, rock, jazz, soul and fusion.  And Gregg Allman is a white man who sings with the feel and soul of Ray Charles.    From the stand out opening riff on blind Willie McTell's \\"Statesboro Blues\\" to the thunderous \\"Whipping Post\\" (my favourite) and the subtly complex \\"Elizabeth Reed\\" - this is the Allmans at their absolute peak - but who knows what heights they could've really scaled had Duane and Berry not tragically died shortly thereafter?  As one reviewer said - they have not scaled the same heights since, but then again neither has anyone else...    My comments to prosepctive buyers is:  If you are simply looking to replace the vinyl LP for a CD then get this.  If you are new to the Allmans and want to buy one CD - then get the double CD \\"Deluxe\\" edition of this - it has the full concert and is well worth having instead.  If you want the best albums ever put out by the Allmans - simply buy ALL of their *first 5 albums* (this is album #3).  If you already have \\"Eat a Peach\\", then you may not want the 2 disc Fillmore set, as EAP has the additional live trackson it, including the 33min version of \\"Mountain Jam\\" (at least with the CD you don't have to flip the record over part way through to listen to the full song).    Recommended 10/10
0060557818|5.0|Essentially a modern-day Alice in Wonderland taking place in London underground, this book sparked my imagination. Gaiman has an elegant simplicity to his prose I really enjoy. This book was a lot of fun and I would recommend it above all of his other works (as good as they are)!
B001DJLCRC|5.0|When the series starts up, it kind of tickles you to see a man turn 180 degrees internally, while keeping up all appearances.    In the end you have a man becoming more and more comfortable living the lie, committing increasingly criminal acts, and yet coming home in the evening to lie to his wife in a soft voice, to keep her placated.    Utterly banal and utterly evil.    Really brilliantly done.
B000002P5W|5.0|This second album by Jimi features I feel, his best songwriting, very scenic and poetic songs, dreamy, very excellent use of words, true work of art, just listen to \\"Castles made of Sand\\" or \\"One Rainy wish\\".<br />The downside is, back in 1967, the record company rushed Jimi and crew for a new album and he had very very little time to record and mix this album, infact one side of the albums original mixes were lost and had to be re-done and another rush job.  Jimi stated in interviews it couda been so much better.  But its a great album, sounds at times a bit bare, and at times truely shrines, one of his best.
B00288KNJU|5.0|\\"Coraline\\" is rather witty and very charming, yet also creepy at the same time. The story is about a girl - Coraline, not Caroline - who dislikes her parents, as many kids her age do. She doesn't like the boy next door either, or his cat, but still she doesn't come across as a brat or anything like that. Soon after the family moves into their new house, she discovers a little door which leads to a parallel version of her world with parents which appear to be much better - they want to spend time with her, treat her nicer, and cook better food. However, these \\"other\\" parents have another noticeable difference - they have buttons for eyes. Coraline soon discovers the hidden horrors of the parallel world; it's some of these scenes that might not be good for the little kids due to how scary they can be.    I watched the movie in 3-D wearing the glasses included and while there were many scenes with things standing out, I think next time I'd rather watch the 2-D version. The colors obviously weren't the same and the effects didn't quite grab me enough. I don't think you can go wrong either way though. One of the amazing things about the movie is the effort which went into its making. The \\"making of\\" shorts included on the disc were very interesting, showing just how much work goes into a stop-motion movie and how they hand-made everything for this film. I think the hard work definitely paid off - the presentation of the film (2-D or 3-D) is impressive, nicely complimenting the charming story and wonderful voice acting.
B000002P5R|5.0|Jimi had advanced very much as a songwriter and producer from 1966 to 1970, (1970 when this album was being made).  It shows terrific songwritting skills, lavished arrangements and excellent playing.  Sadly the majority \\"fans\\" will nevre care for it, even had it been released when Jimi was alive, they cry for more \\"Purple Haze\\" and who knows, the next album mighta been a return to a more straight forward rock, or Jimi mighta just carried, no longer wanting to be a show freak and known for burning his guitar, but known as a ARTIST....just look at the DVD's \\"Moneterey\\" where he's showboating around, then watch the DVD \\"Wild BLue Angel\\" he died just 3 weeks after that concert and you see him just standing....just standing and playing some amazing Guitar!  (with exception on a few songs like Foxey lady\\" where he has fun and showboats).<br /><br />Jimi died before this album was completed, but the majority of songs were finished and I think this CD comes pretty close to what Jimi wouda have released in 1971, a few notables: \\"My Friend\\" was recorded in 1968, good song, but woud not have been included, \\"Pai Gap\\" from 1970 probbaly wouda have been included (You can find that song on a compolation CD called \\"South Saturn Delta\\").<br /><br />Jimi had a few new songs he had just started that may have made it onto the new album, \\"The Valley of Neptune\\" stands out os one of them, \\"Saving my Love for Linda\\" less so but a possibility\\".<br /><br />But what we have here is 17 of his best creative work, songs that carry a message of peace and undersatnding, \\"Straigh Ahead\\", \\"Hey baby\\" \\"Belly Button Window\\" ect.  Songs well crafted, songs Jimi had actually been working on since 1969 and woud not have been released until 1971.  Jimi had such a backlog of songs, at one point, he actually though of releasing it as 3 record set, who knows, he still might have, but what we have here is a great representation of his Final vinal vision.......enjoy!
1439130833|2.0|When I received the book the pages were not attached to the book....The book was purchased new, but did not seem to be in new condition.  I was anxious to receive this but, so when it was delivered I was dissappointed in the condition, especially as a new book.
B000002P7R|5.0|This CD was supposed to show the progression of Jimi's thoughts and works from 1967-1970, but they use some inferior takes of some of the songs.  There is a much better and more complete version of \\"Midnight Lightning\\" available for one example, as well as \\"Look over Yonder\\" and \\"Lover Man\\" and even \\"Message of Love\\"<br />Some songs are just retreds that have previously been relesased on now out of print albums like 1971's \\"ainbow Bridge\\" that contained \\"Look over Yonder\\" and \\"Pali Gap\\" \\"Pali Gap\\" shoud have went on the previois release \\"First Rays...\\" and the song \\"My Friend\\" taken off that CD and put on here, oh well.<br />Other previously released songs are: \\"Stars That Play with Laughing Sam's Dice\\", From 1973's \\"Loose ends\\" and a german version of \\"Smash Hits\\" both no longer inprint, smash hits is but not with that track on it. Also \\"Drofters Escape\\" was also on 1973's Loose Ends album.<br />\\"Tax Free\\" \\"Bleeding Heart\\" and \\"Midnight\\" all 3 songs were on 1972's \\"War Heroes\\" album.<br /><br />It's a decent album, has no continuity, nor to me does it truly trace Jimi's progession of songwriting and production skills, but is more of a collection of songs, songs once agian re-hashed and re-released agian.....maybe this time they will stay in print so we can get on to more great gems still in the studio vaults that havent yet seen the light of day.

B00008GKEG|5.0|How many bands have such a history that they can create a 8 hour documentary and have it fun and entertaining? Not many! Can you imagine a 8 hour film on Journey or REO Speedwagon? Not me.<br />This film actually stems from a 1971 film Neil from Apple corp made called \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" and was placed on fold and was actually be end with a filmed re-union of the 4 Bealtes doing a few songs, but Lennon died and the film was on hold until 1994 when they decided to complete it.<br /><br />The only gripes...2 gripes out of 8 hours.....on some of the songs, one example is Revolution 9, the song jams to a pristine video clip....then they fade the song down and have John talk about how it came into being then the music comes back up. I'd rather have the song play out then have Johns audio talk about the song.<br />Gripe #2 is the bonus features, there are 2 segments were the surviving 3 (Threatles) are playing songs, one is sitting on the ground by a stream and George has a ukilalie, they play 1 song, another section is the 3 are actually back in the studio doing an acoustic jam...I wish they just showed all that footage..or edit it down to shwoing all the songs and some chit-chat...I mean what a historic happening, the 3 surviving Beatles back and actually performing songs! It mighta been a but lack-luster, but just the historical context of that alone merits it worthiness........or maybe Apple will package it as a DVD someday.....make some bucks that way.<br /><br />The Anthology series flows and is never dull, you can watch the whole series then a week later go through it all again and have it seem just as fresh. It's a true work of art from hours and hours of hard work collection various news reels, interviews, tv clips, promos and hours of new interviews edited down to be inserted in the film. I really like the fact you don't see the wives and friends of the Beatles, but you see and hear the Beatles, Sir George Martin and staff of Apple, corp back then narrate this series, its a classic and is their coda.ssic and is their coda.
B00005N6KG|2.0|I liked everything about these headphones - the design, the lightweight feel, the comfort, the sound, etc - except for one thing.  When running or exercising, the perspiration seemed to track right down the frame of the headphones and filled my ear with sweat.  Once covered in sweat, they stopped working.  I constantly had to take them off and wipe them off.  I guess I'm going to have to go back to earphones that go in the canal and form a seal against water and sweat.
B000002OX7|5.0|I heard Who's Next,for the first time,while while I was in Vietnam.I bought it from a guy we called Cherokee,he sold new cassette tapes and other commodities.At that point in time,Who's Next was the best rock album I ever heard.It was beautifully produced and engineered.Entwhistle,Moon and Townshend were on top of their game.The songs are just right in length,and blended together,to form a singular collage,not un like Sgt. Pepper's.The band's dramatic entrance in Townshend's computergenerated,intelligent,hard rock anthem,of drugs,youth and his generation called Baba O'Riley,is maybe the best opening song on any \\"long play album\\" ever,and if that's not enough,Won't Get Fooled Again is surely the best,most complicated,most musical,most computer-ey,most timed,last song on a rock album,ever made,produced,with a finale that's downright visionary of what a rock finale should and can be....occupying the durative space between the first and last songs are a group of beautifully arranged and composed songs...Who's Next is timeless,it is the best,it is as good as rock can be....and just for the record Keith Moon is electrifying,his ADD drumming,is so original,chaotic and greased lightning quick,that his drumming goes  beyond self confidence and talent to define the power of a great drummer..
B00132GBRA|5.0|[[VIDEOID:37352241]]I went on a five (5) mile hike in Taconic State Park (NY, about four [4] miles from the MA border)  most of this hike was up a fairly steep hill (not quite climbing on hands and knees but still pretty steep) through various terrain.  There was a lot of mud because it had recently rained and there were also a few streams here and there like in the video.  These boots conquered all, they performed marvelously during the whole hike.  I really thought I'd have trouble when it came to wet rocks, but they pulled through.  The only time I had trouble crossing rocks was when they were covered with algae, because although they gripped to the algae very well, the algae didn't stay on the rock every time.      As far as how they feel, right off the shelf they felt incredible.  They've got to be some of the most comfortable things I've ever worn.    I HIGHLY recommend them to anyone really.  You don't have to be a hiker to enjoy these.
B0024FAG1W|4.0|During the early 1980's, Americans were treated with vehicles that sported the latest futuristic technology.  For cars, there was \\"Knight Rider\\".  For motorcycles, there was \\"Street Hawk\\".  And in 1983, people were captivated by a helicopter known as \\"Blue Thunder\\".<br /><br />The film was directed by world renown director John Badham (\\"Saturday Night Fever\\" and \\"WarGames\\") and feature a screenplay by Dan O'Banon (\\"Alien\\" films and \\"Total Recall\\") and Don Jakoby (\\"Vampires\\" and \\"Death Wish 3'), music by Arthur B. Rubinstein (\\"Double Jeopardy\\" and \\"Face Value\\") and cinematography by John A. Alonzo (\\"Star Trek: Generations\\", \\"The Meteor Man\\" and \\"Internal Affairs\\").<br /><br />\\"BLUE THUNDER\\" would star Roy Scheider (\\"SeaQuest DSV\\", \\"Jaws\\" and \\"The French Connection) as LAPD helicopter pilot Officer Frank Murphy.  Together with his new rookie partner Officer Richard Lymangood (Daniel Stern), while the two were patroling Los Angeles through the air, they happen to come across on what appeared to be a robbery attempt on city councilwoman Diane McNeely.<br /><br />Unfortunately, before they arrived near the city councilwoman's area, the two were using their helicopter to observe a woman working out nude in her home.  But also, due to previous situations, Officer Frank Murphy is due for a psychological evaluation.  In fact, Murphy tends to use his stop watch to make sure that his mind is thinking straight (despite having nightmares of a Vietnamese soldier being thrown off a helicopter that he was piloting).<br /><br />While meeting with his superior, Captain Jack Braddock (Warren Oates), the LAPD is calling the situation of the councilwoman as a theft and rape incident but Officer Murphy knows that there was no rape but his superior doesn't want to hear anything further from Murphy and relieves both him and Lymangood as pilots for the LAPD temporarily.<br /><br />But the good news for Murphy and Lymangood is that they will be able to test out an advanced helicopter known as \\"Blue Thunder\\".  Using the latest in weapons armament and stealth technology, the \\"Blue Thunder\\" can listen to any conversation as far as 200 ft., armed with machine guns, able to video/audio record outside incidents and also to be tied into various government and law enforcement computers and much more.  The bad news is that the person that is heading the operation for \\"Blue Thunder\\" is US Army Colonel F.E. Cochrane (Malcolm McDowell) who is the primary test pilot of the new helicopter.  Both Murphy and Cochrane end up crossing paths and because of their past history, Murphy despises him for a reason unknown.<br /><br />While on the first night testing the \\"Blue Thunder\\" in Los Angeles, both Murphy and Lymangood are just in awe of the capabilities of the helicopter.  But the two end up using the equipment to spy on Cochrane for the fun of it but what they hear is a shocker.  Because of this, Murphy and Lymangood become a target.  Can Murphy and Lymangood survive long enough to stop the people behind Project THOR?<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />For those who are big fans of \\"BLUE THUNDER\\", you will be happy to know that the film is given a magnificent transfer on Blu-ray.  The film is presented in 1080p High Definition (with an aspect ratio of 2:40:1) and having seen this film and having it on VHS and DVD, I can tell you that this is the definitive version to own.<br /><br />For one thing, for a 1983 film, the film just looks great.  The film offers a stark contrast between the day and nighttime sequences and there is a broad spectrum of colors utilized throughout the film.  I didn't notice any significant artifacting, banding or source noise.  I was so happy to see this film not DNR'd (digital noise reduction) and the grain of the film included but not to the point where its too distracting.  There are far many 1980's films that are too soft or too grainy and this film is just right.<br /><br />As for the audio, \\"BLUE THUNDER\\" is presented with an English and French Dolby TrueHD 5.1 soundtrack.  It's important to emphasize that this film is a 1983 film and can't be compared to today's modern action films.  But  yet, the soundtrack is utilized quite well.  The helicopters rotors spinning, to the echoes of the megaphone, the many explosions and the musical score just coming out quite clear (and loud).  Dialogue remains crisp and clear and overall, there is a good amount of action scenes that utilize the explosions and thus filling the soundstage with automobile and aircraft sounds and machine guns galore.  I was very impressed by the soundtrack for this 26-year-old film.<br /><br />As for subtitles, the film is presented in English, English SDH and French.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"BLUE THUNDER\\" comes with the following special features (featured in standard definition):<br /><br />  * Director, Editor and Motion Control Supervisor Commentary - The Blu-ray includes the 2006 DVD Special Edition commentary featuring Director John Badham, Editor Frank Moriss and motion-control supervisor Hoyt Yeatman.  For those who have never heard of a Badham commentary, Badham is very concise and definitely gives you a peak through his mind of directing and is quite thorough on explaining how this film was created.  It's important to note that these days, a lot of these scenes would be CGI'd but back then, the chase scenes between helicopters were done without CG.  So, it was a challenging and risky film to direct.<br />  * \\"The Special\\": Building Blue Thunder: Making-of the Helicopter - (8:23) Director John Badham, Sydney Z. Litwack (Art Director) and staff from the film discuss the making of the Blue Thunder helicopter and how the concept was created.<br />  * Ride With The Angels: Making Blue Thunder - Multi-part Featurette - (44:41) This making of featurette discuss the Director John Badham and his involvement with the film.  Badham and producers talk about the talent they worked with in the film and what they added to the film.  Also, how talented Warren Oates was in the film but passed away a month after the film stopped shooting.  Discussion about the storyboards, Roy Scheider talks about his excitement of riding in the aircraft and Malcolm McDowell's fear of flying.  Also, how a lot of the explosions and destructive scenes were created.<br />  * 1983 Promotional Featurette - (8:34) The original 1983 featurette featuring clips from the film, behind-the-scenes footage and interviews with the talent of the film.<br />  * BD-Live Enabled - For those with Blu-ray players that are Profile 2.0, this Blu-ray disc is BD-Live enabled.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />When I was younger, I was totally enamored with this film and also the helicopter television shows (\\"Airwolf\\" and \\"Blue Thunder\\") at the time.  Typically, we never really saw a helicopters as a mean, fighting machine.  But \\"BLUE THUNDER\\" really gave us a glimpse of modern technology at that time.<br /><br />It has been 26 years since this film came out in the theaters and watching it again, its easy to be shocked of how much of this film featured actual helicopters flying through Los Angeles and of course, how the destruction of parts in Los Angeles was shown through this film.  Surprising because now in Post 9/11, these type of films will never be created in this manner and nor would we see aircraft going at it like this and if it did, it would be CGI.<br /><br />But it's just remarkable to know how much went into the filming of \\"Blue Thunder\\" without the use of today's modern technology.  How the talents (Scheider and McDowell) actually were in the helicopters being filmed during the air battles and also, the overall destruction of parts of Los Angeles.  There is no way we are ever going to see this type of destruction in this manner in a film, especially how it was created.<br /><br />For the most part, the film shows its age through the various vehicles and clothing styles of the early 80's but the Blu-ray transfer really brings out the detail of the film.  One of the problems of the Special Edition DVD is that the film looked soft and muddy but for the Blu-ray release, I was impressed by its High Definition transfer.  Also, combined with the lossless audio and the fact that audio is a big part of this action film, it made the film much more enjoyable.  And where many 1980's film are devoid of special features for their DVD or Blu-ray release, the good news is that this special edition of \\"BLUE THUNDER\\" does come with a few hours of special features.<br /><br />Overall, \\"BLUE THUNDER\\" is an awesome release on Blu-ray.  The release is quite solid with its impressive on HD and its easy to recommend this film but also, I'm quite confident to say that this is the definitive version of \\"BLUE THUNDER\\" to own at this current time.<br /><br />For fans of this film, this Blu-ray release is definitely recommended!ing.  Discussion about the storyboards, Roy Scheider talks about his excitement of riding in the aircraft and Malcolm McDowell's fear of flying.  Also, how a lot of the explosions and destructive scenes were created.      * 1983 Promotional Featurette - (8:34) The original 1983 featurette featuring clips from the film, behind-the-scenes footage and interviews with the talent of the film.      * BD-Live Enabled - For those with Blu-ray players that are Profile 2.0, this Blu-ray disc is BD-Live enabled.

Surprising because now in Post 9/11, these type of films will never be created in this manner and nor would we see aircraft going at it like this and if it did, it would be CGI.    But it's just remarkable to know how much went into the filming of \\"Blue Thunder\\" without the use of today's modern technology.  How the talents (Scheider and McDowell) actually were in the helicopters being filmed during the air battles and also, the overall destruction of parts of Los Angeles.  There is no way we are ever going to see this type of destruction in this manner in a film, especially how it was created.    For the most part, the film shows its age through the various vehicles and clothing styles of the early 80's but the Blu-ray transfer really brings out the detail of the film.  One of the problems of the Special Edition DVD is that the film looked soft and muddy but for the Blu-ray release, I was impressed by its High Definition transfer.  Also, combined with the lossless audio and the fact that audio is a big part of this action film, it made the film much more enjoyable.  And where many 1980's film are devoid of special features for their DVD or Blu-ray release, the good news is that this special edition of \\"BLUE THUNDER\\" does come with a few hours of special features.    Overall, \\"BLUE THUNDER\\" is an awesome release on Blu-ray.  The release is quite solid with its impressive on HD and its easy to recommend this film but also, I'm quite confident to say that this is the definitive version of \\"BLUE THUNDER\\" to own at this current time.    For fans of this film, this Blu-ray release is definitely recommended!
1878424505|3.0|Well, I definitely think this has a lot of useful points  Unfortunately, these are points that I already knew about or that are (or should be) obvious to most people  The book isn't very detailed and has very simple, easily-constructed messages about how to live your life  A bit too simplistic for this complex modern world  Still, not completely useless  Worth reading if available, but not worth purchasing
B001AQMBNC|4.0|\\"STARMAN\\", the entertaining 1984 film from Director John Carpenter that combined sci-fi, romance and action.<br /><br />Known for films such as \\"The Fog\\", \\"Escape from New York\\", \\"The Thing\\" and \\"Christine\\", Carpenter made his return to the science fiction realm. Having directed space-driven films in the 1960's such as \\"Terror from Space\\", \\"Gorgo versus Godzilla\\", \\"Sorcerer from Outer Space\\" and \\"Dark Star\\", Carpenter is joined by screenwriter Bruce A. Evans (\\"Stand By Me\\") and Raynold Gideon (\\"Stand By Me\\" and \\"Mr. Brooks\\"), composer Nack Nitzsche (\\"Nine 1/2 Weks\\", \\"Stand By Me\\", and \\"The Crossing Guard\\") and cinematographer Donald M. Morgan (\\"Crossing Jordan\\" and \\"Sybil\\").<br /><br />The film would star Jeff Bridges (\\"Tron\\", \\"The Last Picture Show\\" and \\"The Fabulous Baker Boys\\"), Karen Allen (\\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\", \\"Malcolm X\\" and \\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\"), Charles Martin Smith (\\"Drive\\", \\"Left Behind: World at War\\" and \\"Dead Heat\\") and Richard Jaeckel (\\"Baywatch\\", \\"Delta Force 2: The Colombian Connection\\" and \\"Black Moon Rising\\").<br /><br />The film revolves around grieving widow Jenny Hayden (Karen Allen).  Her husband Scott was killed in an accident and she finds herself at her home watching old home films of the two.<br /><br />Meanwhile, an alien probe has crashed and the alien being ends up at the home of Jenny.  The surviving alien immediately looks at photos of the deceased Scott Hayden and from the DNA taken from the lock of hair of Scott, the cloning transformation begins.<br /><br />Jenny sees a blue pulsing light in her living room and discovers a baby that suddenly grows into a young boy, then a teenager and then all of a sudden, a clone of her deceased husband.  The Starman then uses one of the miniature balls that he carries around to communicate with his people to meet him at a rendezvous point.<br /><br />She reacts to fear but is immediately told by the Starman to take him to the state of Arizona.  Thinking that she is being kidnapped and not knowing what will happen to her.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the US government through George Fox has ordered SETI (Search for Extra Terrestrials) agent Mark Shermin and the military to check out the alien vessel.  Discovering that there is no one inside, Shermin believes that the alien is somewhere nearby.<br /><br />While they drive towards Arizona, Jenny starts to see the kindness of the alien.  She also learns that he must get to the rendezvous point in Arizona within three days or else he will die on this planet.  Having a change of heart, Jenny decides to help him get to the destination but with the government after them, will she be able to help him?<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"STARMAN\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1) and I have to say that for a film that came out in 1984, the HD transfer of this film is magnificent.  I have literally watched this film over and over when it first aired on cable and then have seen it presented in a variety of formats (widescreen and re-released in full screen) on DVD but this Blu-ray release is simply the definitive version to own.<br /><br />With many of the scenes shot outdoors, the video quality is quite vibrant for a film that is 25 years old.  When it comes to many 80's films, on Blu-ray, you really don't know what kind of picture quality that you are going to get.  Some look like they have been DNR'd (digital noise reduction) and are very soft and waxy in terms of picture quality, some look aged and as much as I love grain, sometimes it's too prominent.  But for \\"STARMAN\\", colors are vibrant.  You can see Starman's red clothing really come out quite nicely on the video.<br /><br />Of course, with the HD transfer, it does also showcase some of the oldschool sci-fi technology.  For example, there is a scene with Starman and Jenny inside the car and you can tell that the green screen for that certain scene just doesn't look right with the haloing effect around the characters.<br /><br />As for audio, the film is presented in English and French Dolby TrueHD 5.1.  The film actually sounds great for a 1984 film as scenes such as the alien vessel crashing down on Earth, to explosions and blasts that really sound nice through the front channel and surrounds.  For the most part, the film is front channel heavy and there is occasional surround sound usage.  Dialogue is clean and understandable from the center channels and the musical score from Jack Nitzsche also sounds great on HD.<br /><br />Overall, I was very impressed by the picture and audio quality for this film.  Of course, I'm not talking about reference quality but for a 1984 film and seeing how many 80's films have not received a great HD transfer, \\"STARMAN\\" is one such film that definitely looks and sounds much better than its DVD counterpart.<br /><br />As for subtitles, \\"STARMAN\\" is presented in English, English SDH and French.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />There are no special features on this Blu-ray disc but trailers for upcoming releases from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.  This Blu-ray release is BD Live enabled.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />I can easily remember watching this film over and over on HBO when I was younger.  I absolutely loved the film and although watching it now, you do see its campiness due to the special effects of that time but watching it 25 years later, I have to say that I enjoyed every minute of the film again!<br /><br />It was also a great to see John Carpenter really deliver with this film, especially when compared to his later sci-fi film \\"Ghosts of Mars\\" which are of course, is apples and oranges when it comes to comparisons but in terms of quality, Carpenter delivered for this 1984 film.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges did a great job playing an alien life form trying to learn from humans and Karen Allen definitely balances out his character quite effectively.  I actually enjoyed the pacing of the film and seeing how the two main characters had this somewhat of a hostile interaction but slowly, they begin to learn from each other.<br /><br />The Blu-ray release is definitely the definitive version to own at this time.  The HD transfer is much better than the DVD and the audio quality is also great for a film that came out 25 years ago.  Of course, the downside of this release is that there are no lack of special features.  I would imagine that both Jeff Bridges and Karen Allen could have been interviewed.  Also, it would have been a blast to hear a commentary from John Carpenter.<br /><br />A \\"STARMAN\\" TV series did come out in 1986 which furthered the storyline of \\"STARMAN\\" (starring Robert Hays as the Starman) and rumors were circulating in 2008 that a DVD release was on its way but nothing has been confirmed as of this time.<br /><br />But for now, fans of this classic sci-fi series can be proud to know that this Blu-ray release of this film is just beautiful to watch and sounds great ala High Definition.<br /><br />Romantic and entertaining, \\"STARMAN\\" also features a wonderful performance by both Jeff Bridges and Karen Allen.  \\"STARMAN\\" is definitely a Blu-ray release worth the double dip!lly sounds great for a 1984 film as scenes such as the alien vessel crashing down on Earth, to explosions and blasts that really sound nice through the front channel and surrounds.

B002DKF47O|5.0|Behemoth return faster and more brutal than ever on Evangelion.  One of the most noticeable improvements is the vocal attack by Nergal.  His vocals are still layered, but not as much as before and not as processed, so they sound more natural and even more intense.  If you thought due to the band's rising popularity that they would be slowing down you would be very wrong.  Nothing is further from the truth.  The opening track and He who Breeds Pestilence are over the top.  Super heavy and the band is tighter than ever.  The last track Lucifer is their attempt at an epic sound.  It is atmospheric, slow and just flat out rocks from start to finish.   The band incorporates keyboards, different instruments and definite middle eastern flair to some of their arrangements.  Packaging is an excellent digipack.  Have not checked out the making of dvd yet, plan to do that soon.  I love the cover.  It's a black and white pencil drawing that is beautiful and sinister at the same time.  Not your typical death metal cover, it's refreshing.  Curious to see if fellow countymen Vader can top this in a few weeks.
B001V7YWTQ|5.0|Another stellar peformance from the masters of the guitar and keyboard. Eric Clapton in collaboration with Steve Winwood, leave no doubt that their abilities as musicians have only become more polished over the years. The vocals, in addition to the guitar and keyboard work, are nothing less than phenomenal. There is still an unmistakable chemistry between Clapton and Winwood, for those of you old enough to remember the Blind Faith days.
044024367X|1.0|The reviews you're reading here are right on the money. I say this as a big fan of the Jack Reacher series: This is a really bad novel. I didn't keep precise count, but I'd estimate that Reacher spends at least 75 pages either walking or driving around. No exaggeration. Two towns in the middle of nowhere, with Jack Reacher endlessly walking or driving either through, between or around them, page after brutal page. There's little action, a tedious and meandering plot, tepid villians and an absurd conclusion that I'm tempted to spoil for you, purely to dissuade you from reading this awful book (on the remote chance that you're still planning to). You know, like tough love. I should, but I won't.
B0000AGWJ7|3.0|i love avenged sevenfold. but their first cd has too much growling and screaming. in waking the fallen i think they find a much better balance. their are alot more regular vocals witch i prefer but there is a lot of growling and screaming too, witch i know some people do like. its a good cd but unless your a pretty devoted fan you probably wont like it too much. if your looking for something like the self titled avenged sevenfold cd then you probably should just stop at city of evil.
B001OQCV9M|4.0|The good parts of \\"Julie and Julia\\" are so darn strong, beautiful, and new that J&J becomes an instant classic. Grateful audiences are going to be laughing and crying and being inspired by this movie for a long, long time. The Julie portion is the weaker of the two, but not so weak that it sinks the film.<br /><br />Meryl Streep as Julia Child is one of the most endearing, arresting performances ever. That the real Julia Child and her groupies irritate me no end in no way interfered with my appreciation of Streep's amazing characterization. I laughed and cried several times, I was so engaged in the cinematic Streep/Child's story.<br /><br />Streep's chemistry with Stanley Tucci as Paul Child, Julia's husband, is breathtaking. No attempt is made to make Streep or Tucci conventionally attractive. No attempt is made to make them look young and dewy - they weren't - Julia married Paul when she was in her thirties and he was ten years older. Julia is tall; Paul is short; Julia is loud; Paul is bald, quiet and retiring. It is implied that they can't have children. They don't share conventionally romantic movie moments; they don't \\"meet cute,\\" there's no candlelight, no slow dances, no full frontal nudity, no vulgar language (with one hilarious exception involving cannelloni). All Paul and Julia do is share the drudgery and rewards of working life: hers as a cook, his as a state department official. The key to Streep and Tucci's chemistry is that they portray two characters who love each other. Watching a loving, married couple in a marriage that works is one of the great, and sadly rare, pleasures of this film. Steep and Tucci are every bit as charismatic a couple as Tracy and Hepburn. Jane Lynch is also brilliant in a small role as Julia's sister.<br /><br />The Julia segments take place in post-war Paris, and the Paris of this film, one of elegant cafes, haute couture and vintage cars, is someplace we all wished we lived (except for the ever-present cigarette smoke.) No matter how you feel about cooking, the film gets you to care about Julia's slowly being drawn into her destiny as one of the legendary chefs of all time. You also care about, and respect, Paul, his career and its ups and downs in the McCarthy era, and his support of his wife.<br /><br />The Julie Powell portion of the movie is the weaker portion. I really like the film's structure of switching back and forth between contemporary Queens and post-war Paris, contrasting a career woman's attempt to cook all of Julia Child's recipes with Julia Child herself, before she became famous. I just think that the film fails its own structure by simply not making the Julie Powell portion as interesting as the Julia Child portion. Some have complained that Queens is depicted as being too dismal, and Paris too elegant. It's more than that, though.<br /><br />I think Ephron, a brilliant filmmaker, drops the ball with Julie Powell because she never engages the tough questions about Powell's experiment. Was Powell just someone eager for fame in the Warhol era of \\"Everyone is famous for fifteen minutes\\"? Was Powell parasitizing Child's fame? Was Powell a bad wife to her husband as she obsessed on completing her self assigned task? Have blogs killed quality writing? Was Julia Child correct in her condemnation of Powell?<br /><br />I am not saying that the answer to any of the above questions is \\"Yes.\\" I'm not bashing Julie Powell. I'm saying that by not engaging them, Ephron made the Julie portion of the film simply not as interesting as it could have been had these very real questions been engaged. Instead, Ephron tries to turn Julie into a cute, bland Meg Ryan character, and it never works, not for an instant. When Powell has lunch with her career gal friends, her friends are such Gordon Gecko style sharks that we care less for Powell for being so needy as to want to impress them. The absolute worst scene in the movie comes when Powell, who has never been depicted as feeling happy orfulfilled, not with her job, not with her husband, not with her home life, plays 65 answering machine messages from agents, editors, and publishers who want to make her famous. As these messages play, she has sex with her husband, and her husband's comment lets us know that this is the first time in a long while that he has experienced satisfaction from his wife.<br /><br />The message of that scene is so tawdry, it cheapens the glow created by the Julia portion of the film, that shows Julia Child achieving satisfaction *before she ever becomes famous*. Julia *loved* cooking. Julia *loved* her husband. Yes, she celebrates when Knopf wants to publish her book, but she is so divorced from the rat race that she doesn't even know how to pronounced \\"Knopf\\" - whether the initial K is silent.<br /><br />Julie Powell is depicted as needing fame to feel good about herself, and the movie never interrogates that. Had it done so, the Julie segments would have been as interesting as the Julia ones.<br /><br />In any case, this is a great film that will enjoy a much deserved embrace by its fans.husband, not with her home life, plays 65 answering machine messages from agents, editors, and publishers who want to make her famous.

B001E2JNA6|5.0|This is a review, specifically, for the Blu-Ray version of the Colin Firth, Jennifer Ehle version of Pride and Prejudice. There are plenty of excellent reviews about the mini-series itself, and I obviously agree with all the positive ones because I spent the money for my own Blu-Ray two-disk set. Mostly I just wanted a good, old favorite to test out the new player, and P&P is one of my all-time best loved series/movies. I've watched it on everything from a standard television during its original broadcast, to DVD, to YouTube. So I knew it would be an enjoyable experience, but what I wasn't prepared for was what a difference the remastering made in my overall viewing pleasure.<br /><br />Colors are more vibrant (though almost a bit oversaturated at points, flesh colors get very red and bright, in spots), to the point where I was surprised to see the subtle, but distinct colors in the sisters' dresses (I had thought they were ALL a sort of off-white), background colors, paintings, wallpapers, furniture, and the richness of Colin Firth's wardrobe--even the lights of the candles on desks and tables were warm and luminous. I had always loved this film for its story, now I could really appreciate the artistry involved.<br /><br />I agree with a previous reviewer who complained about some grain in certain scenes, especially the opening shots with Darcy and Bingley riding around Netherfield, but at no point did it detract from the overall improvement in the look of the film, nor would it dissuade me from buying this film in this format, if you love the story as much as I do. This is now my preferred way to watch this film, and while I'll enjoy it any way I can, I will always want to see it this way, if possible. If you're a fan of this mini-series I can't recommend this format highly enough.<br /><br />One note: after I put it in and was blown away by the beauty of the thing, I said \\"wow\\" rather loudly, and my wife walked in and I told her I was watching the Blu-Ray versionof Pride and Prejudice. She looked at the screen and asked. \\"Is it any different? Looks the same, to me.\\"<br /><br />ADDED NOTE: Having seen the whole series and all the extras now in this format, I'm more convinced than ever that it's a massive improvement. There's also a \\"making of\\" the remastering short that explains how this was taken entirely from the original Super 16 negatives using a new, recently invented process, when all the other version were taken from prints. So you've never seen a version as good as this, even on laser disk. Fantastic work by all concerned.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|This show is quite awesome. I am a computer geek, comic collector, fantasy gamer, with many similar hobbies and mannerisms to many of the characters on this show. The inside geek jokes are truly gems. My wife loves the show also because she is a non geek who has put up with my hobbies for so many years that she is reminded of us in several episodes. I have seen most of these episodes and have pre-ordered this season. The episodes I have seen from this season (about 75%) led me to order season 1 on DVD. Season 1 was FANTASTIC, and I am sure the episodes I have missed from this season will be just as good. The episodes I caught I loved, and definitely warrant repeat watching.<br /><br />This is truly a show that relies on it's ensemble cast. When the four main geek characters get together it is always magical. The actor playing Sheldon is my favorite and deserves multiple emmies.<br /><br />SOAP BOX TIME:<br />I have a comment on the future of this show. A few times this season the writers have portrayed the geek side of the characters in a harsher negative light. They should celebrate these aspects instead. Show the hobbies and obsessions as they are in all their glory, and let the audience judge the level of acceptance. We fanboys already know what we do is not necessarily the \\"social norm\\", but our numbers are growing; Millions play WoW or online games, the San Diego Comicon has become a celebrated cultural phenomenon, D&D and other games like Magic the Gathering are quite popular, and SciFi and fantasy are becoming more and more accepted forms of mainstream entertainment. (Lord of the Rings anyone?)<br /><br />This show is too good to fall into the sterotypical trap of labeling the geeks as the outcasts to be shunned. It should be less about laughing at them (us), and more about laughing with them (us). So many shows miss this mark and insult what could be a huge audience share. This only happened once or twice this season that I remember, mainly in situations where Leonard was trying too hard to be \\"normal\\" to impress Penny.hard to be \\"normal\\" to impress Penny.
B000FVNX2Q|2.0|I bought this for the June 2009 CFA level 1 exam.  I had an engineering HP calc during school and decided to go with an HP for the CFA exam.  A year up to the exam, it was working fine until just about 2 weeks prior to the exam date.  Some keystrokes had trouble registering, requiring multiple key taps.  Not good!  I had to be extra careful with my entries during the exam which slowed me down a bit but I ended up passing.  However, I will switch to the TI for level 2 and keep this one as a backup. Contrary to my past experience with HP calcs, the durability of this model is disappointing, especially for the price. It's definitely a mechanical problem, as I ran the on-board self-diagnostics and it passed. Caveat Emptor!
B000I0RNV6|5.0|World War II has just ended and life in the Sicilian village of Giancaldo centers around the Cinema Paradiso where townsfolk gather to see the exciting and glamorous world outside.  Young Toto spends all his free time sneaking into the theatre for the movies and most especially for the old projectionist, Alfredo, who loves him like a son.  Toto wants to grow up and show movies just like Alfredo, but one night, there is a terrible fire in the projection box.<br /><br />This movie is simply perfect.  It's nostalgic and sentimental and quite touching.  The actors are uniformly excellent, especially the adorable Salvatore Cascio who plays Toto as a child and Marco Leonardi who gives a sensitive performance as teenage Toto. Philippe Noiret is  wonderful as the old projectionist who teaches Toto about life.  In some ways, this movie is similar to [[ASIN:0767827902 The Last Picture Show]]; it's about the passage of time with the one constant being the local theatre.  We watch as Toto grows up and the town modernizes, but the villagers retain their close bond with one another.<br /><br />The soundtrack alone is enough to send you running for tissues; it's  beautiful and heartbreaking.  The direction is outstanding, with nary a single wasted moment.  In Italian with English subtitles, it's a timeless and universally-appealing story of a boy who falls in love with movies.  Highly recommended.
1582701709|3.0|The book is in a very good condition, and I received it quite soon after the ordering.    although the writing of the book is not as good as I thought.
B000EHSVOG|4.0|Though I thoroughly enjoyed this, I will always prefer the Poseidon Adventure. Why? Because that didn't tread water for nearly three hours! They could've trimmed out a lot of the exterior shots of the building on fire when nothing is really going on or no one is dying. Anyway, the actors are top notch. The only real complaint here is O.J. He disappears halfway through the movie after he rescues (now there's a surprise) Jennifer Jones' cat. Then miraculously reappears to give Astaire the animal. The deaths in this one aren't as compelling as Allen's previous all-star escapade. Whereas three of the four main deaths of that were emotional, the two deaths in this where I actually feel any emotion at all is when Jones shockingly falls out of the elevator. Then when we cut to a wider shot, we see her continue to fall until she hits the side of the building and is sent spiraling to oblivion. The other I'm referring to is Norman Burton's near the beginning. He just sacrificed his life to save some idiot security guard. Robert Vaughn, though he's featured in plenty of scenes, doesn't really have a lot of screen time to actually care about his death. And Chamberlain I wish was killed in the explosion when he's trying to go down the stairs but I had to endure him until he falls to his death. The way the fire's put out does seem rather convenient, seeing as how those tanks have been there THE ENTIRE TIME! But then again, they probably didn't want to kill all the people (yet), and I don't think the fire department would have that kind of authority to make that kind of decision anyway (then again I wouldn't know). The effects are first rate, though, like stated before, they really didn't need so many shots of the model building on fire unless there's actually some action going on.
B002E2QHBS|2.0|Big Disappointment to get this. First off, I bought this because of Donovan's Reef by Country Joe which existed nowhere else and For Yasgur's Farm from Mountain. I had a lot of the unreleased stuff but not all. The rare Country Joe and the Fish tunes where among the reasons for not giving this a one star review. The positives I thought were as mentioned the Country Joe and the Fish rare tunes as well as the Blood Sweat and Tears who, once they got a real singer after kicking Al Kooper out of the band, sounded even better. Now my gripes. Jerry Garcia is listed as giving some acid rap w/ Country Joe. This was not Jerry but Ken Babbs. Is anyone doing there homework? There are digital clicks in the Donovan's Reef which was an amazing performance. This digital click problem existed in my copy of Rhino's 25 anniversay edition of Twisted Sister's Stay Hungry. During Mountain's \\"Theme from an Imaginary Western\\" at approximately 1:49 there is bad digital fuzz. Why? Is my copy defective? Did anyone else encounter this problem? During \\"For Yasgur's Farm\\" there is a lot of bad sonic crackle. If this was in the master, why didn't they clean it up? People who post on bootleg sites do it all the time. The software exists. My final gripe is there is a listing for \\"Get a Job (reprise).\\" You think because it is listed as a song that it should be something significant. Well it's not. It's 12 seconds long and seem more like an extension of \\"At The Hop.\\" The other problem is some of the selections. Why do we only get one new tune from John Sebastian + the same ones included on the first Woodstock album. Where was \\"Younger Generation\\"? It was in the movie but included nowhere else in all the soundtrack, outtakes official releases that came out. \\"Darling Be Home Soon\\" exists in video format on but not here. Would have replaced nicely the two Sebastian cuts that are here that were on the first Woodstock album. The CSN material is stuff from the first two Woodstock albums. Why not put the stuff that came out on the first box set like Find the Cost of Freedom for example? Whose in charge here? This collection wasn't cheap. Stuff like Quill and Bert Sommer are a nice touch and was another reason that I honestly couldn't give this a one star review. There was some effort made but it could have been so much better. Crying shame.
0143038419|5.0|This book was referred to in a sermon by the priest at the church I attend, and many of us purchased it just based on the one example he quoted.  I became absorbed in this woman's story, her search for God, peace of mind, and balance in her life.  Ms. Gilbert has an engaging style of writing that showed her humor, her frank honesty and her deep desire to seek God.  By the end of the book I was laughing out loud and wanted the story to go on and on.  I will definitely read more books by this author.  I thoroughly recommend \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" for any adult or mature reader of any religious background (or none).
0307266303|5.0|Very rarely do I find a book that really meets expectations as high as this one with the number of 5 star reviews it received.  This book goes by fast and you will read it in a few nights because you will want to know what is next.  I think it was constructed in a nice way, both blending the larger storyline with historical points as well as the authors own journey.  The book captures the emotion and spirit behind running and life in a way that was simple and not preachy.  We often forget as we get older those things we love to do as children simply because of the pleasure it brings and in the case of running we make it complicated and competitive for no real reason.  If you are not Usain Bolt but pay to enter 5Ks etc... you should read this book before heading out.  Life matters more when you inject both purpose and spirit into your daily activities.  Excellent book and I hope you enjoy it.
B00006F2TV|4.0|Spider-Man is one of my favorite superheroes of all time. This movie was very well done from start to finish. What makes Spider-Man so darn good isn't its action or music, its the story behind it. The story is very heart warming and touching. You connect with the hero so well that its like he really exists. Its rare to find a comic book movie that not only delivers a very good story, but a touching one as well. Unlike another film I just reviewed (Wanted), this movie tells the story of a man that learns that with great power comes great responsibility.   Setting the wonderful story aside, the rest of the movie falls into place as well. The action sequences are well done and exciting. I'd want nothing more than to be able to web sling across buildings like Spidy does. I loved the soundtrack to this film. The music is original and powerful, and it may give you goosebumps. The acting is very well done in this film as well.  I think the best part about this movie is that it feels very complete. While there is no cliffhanger at the end of the film, it successfully is left open to continue future stories. Nothing feels rushed. Nothing feels missing. Spider-Man feels like a full helping of everything good.
0316017922|5.0|I found picked this book up one day at a Barnes and Noble just to have something to read for a little bit. Once I started, I couldn't stop and was totally entranced by the information and arguments that were being presented before my eyes. When I had to leave, I made a mental note to remember to buy the book at another time when I saw it. I saw it on Amazon.com for a great price and purchased it immediately.     The sections that I was able to get into at Barnes and Noble don't even compare to what is explained further into the book as they all become connected.   I really have a different outlook on life now as far as how certain people or groups of people become successful and the reasons that they do. Natural ability and intelligence are only half the battle; what really makes the difference is where you come from, what time period you grow up in, and if your skill-set is high enough when the world really has a demand for it. The connections to certain groups and individuals like Bill Gates and why he became so successful just make so much sense.     I highly recommend this book to anyone; it's a great read and flows very nicely.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|We all love this movie don't we? But lets be honest. This movie wouldn't be that good if it was any other villain. Hell, it wouldn't be as good if Heath Ledger didn't play the Joker. And seriously, the movie wouldn't have gotten the publicity it got if Heath Ledger hadn't died! (god bless his soul). Lets face it: while The Dark Knight really was a good movie at heart, Heath's performance as the Joker skyrocketed the movie's box office and critical success.  I give this film 5 stars and proudly at that. I never liked Batman. I never liked any of the comics or the old movies. But Batman Begins was great, and this movie was greater. While I won't join the mainstream crowd and say that this movie was the best of all time, but I'll admit its one of the best. Nothing much to say about this film other than the fact that I'd recommend it to people. Two thumbs up, and I open my arms welcomely for a sequel... even though it will probably never be as good as this one.   And jesus christ, why does Batman still sound like a freakin smoker with lung cancer?
B001PPF126|4.0|Radiohead<br />The Bends Collector's Edition Disc 2; 2009<br />Capitol Records<br /><br />My Rating: 65/100<br /><br />This is a pretty solid compilation. It collects most of the relevant non-LP tracks from THE BENDS, with a few notable exceptions, and clearly demonstrates just what a great band Radiohead were becoming. The first six tracks comprised the excellent, dark MY IRON LUNG EP released between PABLO HONEY and THE BENDS, and give a far clearer indication of where the band would head after THE BENDS than anything contained on that album. \\"Permanent Daylight\\" and \\"The Trickster\\" see the band shifting away from British mope-rock and incorporating post-punk and paranoia. \\"Maquiladora,\\" released as a b-side after the album's release, is one of the best tracks the band has ever recorded, and \\"How Can You Be Sure\\" sounds like something that just missed the cut as well. My only major gripes are that the remixed versions of \\"Planet Telex\\" were not included, and, more significantly, the superior Nellee Hooper remix of \\"Talk Show Host\\" is no where to be found. Not that it REALLY matters, since you can still pick it up on the ROMEO & JULIET soundtrack, but I'm just sayin. As a last criticism, it would have been nice to really dig deep on this one and show forth some ancient demos or something. All in all, a decent compilation, and worth purchasing for Radiohead fans that haven't jumped headlong into their b-sides yet.<br /><br />TRACKS:<br /><br />1. The Trickster (5/5)<br />2.

B00005JNJV|4.0|I'm not a Batman fan but I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I thought I ever would. The movie has a good story and it fleshed out the main character better than I anticipated. I also like how they didn't use popular villains and still had an excellent story. This moody and thrilling film is something that I'd recommend to both fans of the comics and newcomers alike.  While the story is good, its not complex enough for me to give it a 5/5. Nor is the action something to brag about.
B001UV4XU6|4.0|Finally, the day has arrived and I can happily say that I've lived to see something that I almost lost my hope to see - a truly original, clever, beautiful, creative, funny and moving, modern Romantic Comedy. I am happy to write these two words in capital letters. Nothing is new in this world. It is impossible to come up with the new plot about love or possibility of love, or expectation of love or losing it but it is possible to look at the old story with a fresh eye and make the movie as enchanting as 500 Days of Summer. The first time director Marc Webb has started on a very high note. His movie is so charming (I know I use this word a lot but it describes 500 days perfectly). It combines many different techniques and succeeds adorably in following two leads and their 500 days of getting together and gradually drifting apart. It is rarely I see the movie which makes me smile from the beginning to the end. I felt like that big silly grin was glued to my face and I did not mind. It is nothing Webb did that I have not seen before - broken narrative,jumping back and forward in time, using the split screen technique (which makes the best scene in the film with many memorable scenes), inserting a musical number that seems to come from a Bollywood movie,changing the real world into animation. Yes, I've seen this all before but all together these tricks have mixed in something magical, delicately bitter-sweet and funny without being stupid, loud, vulgar, and pushy. The big part of the magic is with no doubt an undeniable palpable chemistry between two leads, both known for their previous performances in the independent movies. Joey Deschanel (Summer) was the best part of All the Real Girls (2003). As for Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Tom), I believe he is becoming one of the best actors of his generation. Few years ago I wrote about his performance in George Araki's Mysterious Skin, \\"Joseph Gordon-Levitt, is simply the shining star of the film and I'll make sure from now on to check out all his new movies\\". I am glad that I check this movie. It has generated a lot of positive reviews, and it deserves them. Time will tell but I think 500 Days of Summer may become Annie Hall for the modern time. Yes, I believe it is that good. There were few things that I did not like very much, for example a clich&eacute;d smart-alecky rather annoying character of pre-teen sister of Tom. But the entire movie is so good that I don't want to nit-pick and I recommend it highly.<br /><br />P.S. Wherever you are, Jenny Beckman, I want to thank you for having inspired this movie.<br /><br />4.5/5heck out all his new movies\\". I am glad that I check this movie.

B000UR9T8C|4.0|I gave the third entry in the franchise 4/5. Some may think that was a little too high, and I understand. But personally, I still think this was a good Spider-Man movie. I will say, however, that this film does not necessarily have the same gripping story that the previous two had. It does make an effort at trying, but I think it tries too hard. I could go on and on by talking about how Venom wasn't good, or how the movie was too long... but the biggest problem with Spider-Man 3 is that it tries to put too many things in at once.  When I say 'things' I mean:        1) There were too many villains        2) An abrupt and poorly fleshed out love triangle         3) Too many story arcs  Despite this, the movie still managed to entertain me, and I would never in a million years say this was a bad movie. There were improvements to action and other little things, but the overly complex (or maybe I should say underlycomplex) story was a bit of a negative.   Something fans should keep in mind about this film is the director. He had complete creative control over the first two films. However, he did not have that same control that he had with this film. Matter of fact, Venom was never supposed to be in this film. Writers convinced the director that it would be a good idea. The director threw him in for the fans, but at heart, he didn't get to use the character as he saw fit. Matter of fact, I don't remember the director liking Venom's character to begin with, saying that he was 'more inhuman than he prefered'. Fortunately, a Spider-Man 4 and 5 have been confirmed, and the director plans on having total creative control again. With this in mind, I think we can expect the future installments in the series to be more like Spider-Man 1 and 2.

0451196716|5.0|The Long Walk is an oldie. Written in King's college days, it was first rejected for publication. After quite some time it was released under Richard Bachman as the author.<br /><br />The book is a masterpiece of the dark human condition & the darkness of humanity. Set in a military, fascist America, The Long Walk takes place every May 1 with 100 teenage boys. King touches this new country with very minor references. The boys begin the Walk in Presque Isle, Maine & continue walking south non-stop until only one is left to claim the Grand Prize. The Prize being anything you want for the rest of your life. What happens to the 99 non-finishers? Body bags resulting from a bullet or two to the head from the monitoring soldiers. The boys, by the way, take a test for acceptance into the walk. They all participate willingly & are not coerced.<br />You can accumulate 3 warnings for falling below a pace of 4 miles an hour. Every hour walked at 4 miles an hour erases a previous warning. If after 3 warnings you cannot continue your pace, you are quite literally eliminated.<br /><br />Actually, the Walk is considered a sport by this new America. Possibly the greatest event of the year, the crowds are throngs & the Walkers are heavily bet on.<br /><br />The rather mundane action of walking is masterfully molded by King into one of his darkest tales. It's a fascinating tale of the human condition where mental & emotional prowess & conversation among the boys must overcome the incredible physical pain of non-stop walking for hundreds of miles. The fear of the bullet, always on their minds. Friendships form, though they know they cannot last.<br /><br />By the time the end of the walk is in sight, these boys have aged before our eyes. The Prize is no longer important. The Walk may be interpreted as the walk of life, if you choose. There are a few interpretations the reader can make.<br />The book is a real page turner. The dark tale will get hold of you & it'll be difficult to shake it off.<br /><br />I found myself with only a couple pages to go, asking myself how King is going to end this novel. The answer is he ends it very wellouple pages to go, asking myself how King is going to end this novel. The answer is he ends it very well
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Someday, Pixar is going to do it -- they're going to create an emotionally uninspiring, lackluster animated movie.<br /><br />But in the meantime, they're still putting out delightful for-all-ages animated movies like \\"Up,\\" which defies the usual kid-movie conventions by starring a crotchety seventysomething old man. It's a charming, fun little adventure story with flying dogs and balloon-powered houses, but underlying it is a bittersweet little message about not letting the present be bogged down by the past.<br /><br />As a child, the shy Carl Fredricksen bonded with the oddball Ellie over their shared love of adventure, the explorer Charles Muntz, and Paradise Falls. They later married, move into their \\"clubhouse\\" together, and lived a long but sadly childless life together -- and when Ellie died, she had never fulfilled her dream of going to Paradise Falls.<br /><br />Now crotchety, alone and harassed by a real estate developer, Carl (Ed Asner) is finally ordered to a retirement home. But he isn't about to go quietly -- instead he attaches thousands of balloons to his house and floats it away in the general direction of South America. But he accidentally takes an enthusiastic, naive Wilderness Explorer (a thinly-veiled Boy Scout) named Russell (Jordan Nagai) along for the ride. Poor kid was just trying to earn an \\"assisting the elderly\\" badge.<br /><br />But the jungle trek to Paradise Falls turns out to have some surprising obstacles: a big emulike bird that Russell names Kevin, a talking dog named Dug (\\"I am jumping on you, bird!\\"), and a mysterious old man who lives deep in the heart of the jungle. Turns out the old guy is very familiar to Carl -- and to capture Kevin, he's willing to sacrifice Carl and Russell.<br /><br />Industry experts were babbling about how \\"Up\\" wouldn't be as popular as the previous Pixar movies, because the protagonist is basically a crusty old coot. Well, that shows what they know. It ended up becoming one of those classic movies that somehow appeals to all ages -- while the humor and action appeal to children, adults can appreciate Carl's love for his lost wife, and his slow realization that he's clinging to the past.<br /><br />In fact, the first ten minutes are some of the most heart-tugging, quietly bittersweet scenes I've seen in a long time. Without a word, they show all the ups and downs of a realistic marriage -- joys, sorrows (Ellie's inability to have children), growing old together, and finally loss.<br /><br />But it's not a depressing movie by any stretch -- in fact, it's like a childhood fantasy come to life, complete with a floating house suspended on hundreds of balloons, and biplanes piloted by a talking dog army.. Plenty of great dialogue (\\"Do you want to play a game? It's called See Who Can Go the Longest Without Saying Anything.\\" \\"Cool! My mom loves that game!\\") and an action-packed climax in an aged airship.<br /><br />Ed Asner is absolutely perfect as the ubergrouch Carl -- crotchety, grumpy, and determined to fulfill his beloved wife's lifelong dream, but gradually realizing that what he's really clinging to is his past. Jordan Nagai is equally perfect as Carl's polar opposite: a naive, sweetly chattery Wilderness Scout who is determined to reunite Kevin with her baby chicks. He's really just a sweetie-pie.<br /><br />And the utterly adorable Dug and the other dogs deserve special notice. These creatures are utterly hilarious -- they talk (\\"I hid under your porch because I love you\\") and act (\\"Scream all you want, small mailman!\\") the way dogs would if they talked. Three words: cone of shame.<br /><br />\\"Up\\" continues Pixar's running tally of gloriously animated, emotionally layered movies that the entire family can enjoy.

B001FB55H6|4.0|Watchmen is a film directed by aesthetically strong Zac Snyder ([[ASIN:B000Q6GX5Y 300]] and the [[ASIN:B0002ABURA Dawn of the Dead]] remake).  This film is as loyal a transfer as can possibly be imagined of the twelve issue [[ASIN:1401219268 comic book]] masterpiece written by Alan Moore.  The Watchmen was a story tailor-made for the comic book medium, it isn't and never was intended to be made into a film, so I can at least partially sympathize with Moore's frustration in seeing this happen.  To be honest, I'm an even bigger fan of Moore's [[ASIN:1563898586 League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]] series and I'm a bit surprised and perplexed to not hear he has the same animosity toward the [[ASIN:B00005JM5B film]] version of his work there, especially when considering the tremendous difference in the quality of that movie compared to Snyder's work on the Watchmen.  The Watchmen is an evenly paced epic that is surely not for everyone.  It has its minor flaws but it is still an outstanding achievement.<br /><br />To briefly summarize, the film takes place at a time that would be Richard Nixon's fifth term in office.  It is literally a setting that considers what might happen if superheroes were actual and had a major impact on our reality.  For example, Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup), a naked blue omnipotent character, changes the results of our country's war in Vietnam.  A lot changes, so that is just one example.  Other characters include; the Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), an elder Watchmen that has serious ethical issues; Silk Spectre II (Malin Ackerman), the daughter of a previous hero; Night Owl II (Patrick Wilson), a more virtuous hero with gadgets reminiscent of Batman; Rorsharch (Jackie Earle Haley), a masked vigilante outlaw type; and Ozymandias (Matthew Goode), a seemingly effeminate yet nearly invincible capitalist.<br /><br />I actually waited for the performances to be a bit of a disappointment, but they were not nearly as bad I had heard and expected from seeing how other actors perform within a Snyder film.  In fact, Haley's role as Rorsharch was actually exceptional.  He had a tremendous presence and seemed to know the character more deeply than his cast-mates.  It most likely helped of course that his character is more intense and tragic than the others.  On the flip side, Ackerman was flat more often than not, but she looked great.  Crudup can't be blamed as his character is no longer human.  Morgan was also great as the Comedian but I'll confess that I was not aware that he wasn't Robert Downey Jr. until after I watched the movie.  My other minor complaints would be the make-up used to age some of the characters like Silk Spectre I (Carla Gugino) and Richard Nixon (Robert Wisden) and that Phobos and Deimos would not appear the way they do on the Martian landscape like they do here.  That last one is admittedly a really silly nitpicking.<br /><br />There are many positive things to say about the visual effects but that should be pretty obvious just from the commercials.  The story is a hugely creative one and even when watered down for the screen it still serves as the film's strongest point by far.  It is more than enough to provoke some deeper thinking than other films within this sub-genre, but the pace of the story almost made me hope for a mini-series on Showtime or HBO at first.  In the end I had no problem with the slower scenes, but I know that some viewers did and will.  Still, Snyder and company make the film work well enough to give it a strong recommendation.ctors perform within a Snyder film.  In fact, Haley's role as Rorsharch was actually exceptional.

It's so clear the videos chosen are perfecto. I just wish that it wasn't a two sided disc so I dont have to flip the disc over for the rest. Nevertheless, MJ will live in film & history forever.

1423377001|2.0|This book is based on a seriously faulty assumption, that is, all goods are of the same quality and they are not. The writer must rely on the media for information as it is quite apparent that he has little first hand experience with product quality.<br /><br />For example, tools. As any person who works with their hands will tell you, tools made in USA are still far superior to the stuff made in China or Pakistan. Likewise he is totally unaware of the difference in things like programming. Those who know, know that the clean tight code created in say, Germany is miles ahead of the farmed out bloatware that comes from many US (mainly one large one) companies.<br /><br />His view of history is likewise skewed. Ford tried his ideas in the late 50's and the result was the Edsel. The same is true for GM. Look under the hood of a Hillman (Datsun) from the 50's and then the Datsun of the 70's. The changes are so astounding that you could not tell they were even made by the same company. Now look at GM, nearly identical except for the exterior shell.<br /><br />Most importantly, people do not buy a Volvo instead of a Hyundai because of the way it looks. They buy because Volvo is a better car. In the 80's when most American cars were extremely fortunate to see 100,000 miles it was not at all uncommon for a maintained Volvo to see 250,000 miles. It's not how it looks but how it works, AKA, Volkswagen Beetle.<br /><br />I really tried to get behind the premise of the book but the further I went along the more apparent it became that the author simply has no clue about what he is writing. The first half was not too bad but the last 20% was simply dreadful. Somewhere between listening to cats in heat or nails scratched across a chalkboard. Nothing but a replay of the feel good ramblings from the self-help gurus of the 60's and 70's. Yes it is really that bad.

B00288KNLS|1.0|I sat down with my teenager last night and watched this movie.  I was looking at the cover and reading the rating of PG and thought... 'hmm this doesn't sound too bad, maybe my little one could have watched it with us'.  I am so glad I didn't let that happen!  This was a horribly scary movie.  To not rate it PG-13 implies that it would be fine to watch with the whole family with children less than 13 and, because it is animated, possibly even include children as young as four or five.  But please do not be mislead into thinking that!  The subject matter and content of this movie should not be viewed by children younger than 13!<br /><br />The main character Coraline, is understandably mad and depressed because her parents have no time for her and pay no attention to her, but she takes it out on every one around her, especially \\"Wybie\\".  Wybie is a little boy who lives near the house Coraline just moved into.  Wybie is short for Wyborne, which when Coraline yells at him to go home, changes his name to \\"Why Were You Born!\\"  Children hear that so often from the bullies at school, they don't need to hear it validated, condoned and encouraged on the big screen!<br /><br />This movie is very similar to Alice in Wonderland in weirdness.  The cat talks.  Flowers come alive attacking and grabbing at you.  Bugs are oversized, becoming chairs and wardrobes.  Coraline has to open a small door and travel through a tunnel to get through to the other side.  Other characters are far out, speak in riddle or rhyme, disappear and pop up out of nowhere.  Cute mice turn in to nasty rats.  A circus performer dances around strangely and is obsessed with eating beets.<br /><br />There are so many oddities included in the movie, in addition to the ones I listed above, that I just plain don't understand.  In a theater, to watch a performance, the entire audience is Scottish terriers sitting on plush theater seats.  Two women live together and at one moment you wonder if they are a couple.  One women is old and uses a walker.  The other has super skinny legs but HUGE breasts.  Which at one time they show her completely nude wearing only a thong and pasties doing a dance on stage!<br /><br />The movie deals with witch craft, ghosts and voodo-like dolls.  The two women believe in reading tea leaves.  Coraline is presented with a doll that resembles her which we find out later is how the \\"other mother\\" spies on Coraline.  While Coraline is in the other world she gets thrown into a mirror by her \\"other Mother\\" which puts her in a room without an exit.  There she meets the ghosts of three children who had lived and died in this other world.  The \\"other mother\\" turns from a very nice woman to a very angry spider like, skeleton like, robot like, thing.<br /><br />This movie is full of adult content.  There are a lot of scary, really freaky images.  Lots of anger.<br /><br />I believe this is just one writers warped idea of a story.  The writer must have been on drugs or was in an altered state of mind.  I don't know how the movie ever became reality or how the book was ever published.  But this is not a movie I would recommend at all.  Even if you look beyond the weirdness and scary images, the story is just not there.nd uses a walker.

B000002UA2|5.0|Here we have Pink Floyd saying goodbye to cult band status, about to go to the Dark Side of........well, you know.<br /><br />Obscured By Clouds is a soundtrack, the last album they made before becoming rock royality in  1973. They already did two other film scores-More and Zabriski Point- but this is the most fully realized, prepared for a movie called The Valley.<br /><br />The disc starts with \\"When You Are In,' a guitar blaze, which kicks in when Nick Mason cracks his solid drum fill. There is a beatiful organ piece, and some wonderfully organic folk songs, such as \\"Childhoods End.\\"<br /><br />Speaking of ends, this soundtrack is far more song oritented than the avant gaurd jamming and suites they were making up to Meddle. Floyd streamlines their sound here.<br /><br />But not in the way Dark Side Of The Moon is streemlined. That album is a model of slick 1970s studio production and mature progrssive rock. Obscured by Clouds still has accustic folk and soundscapes that work as songs, not just bridges between songs, which Floyd was about to do on Dark Side.<br /><br />This album really is an ending: Pink Floyd becoming a progressive rock powerhouse and not a experimental art band.<br /><br />It is Pink Floyd waving the 60s goodbye.
1416550534|1.0|Could have been engrossing and spellbinding, as other readers have found it, but I just didn't care a at all about any of the characters. They were just too predictable, with none of the kind of distinctive voices that get into your head (read 'The Thirteenth Tale\\" instead).  The basic plot outline was intriguing & could have been so much better told, so I just skipped to the end to find out what the real story was.
0143113100|5.0|I found this book to be wonderfully enlightening. The examples drawn from the lives of real people humanized the book, and they give hope that many kinds of brain trauma can be successfully overcome.
B001LRJH0U|4.0|\\"Appaloosa\\" is a western done right.  There's great dialog and the characters are well developed and interesting.  Great music and a good story.  Both Viggo Mortensen and Ed Harris are wonderful to watch.  This movie is an unexpected gem in this day and age.  The movie has a very authentic look and feel to it.  If you're a fan of the western genre, don't miss it.
B001K3JF7K|1.0|With the release of Miss Krall's first album, \\"Stepping Out,\\" I was, like many others,really impressed.  There were very nice arrangements,all tightly played, and the music had a very nice impact and an intimate jazz club feel.  Following her initial (and well-deserved) success, I have begun to feel that Miss Krall has been encouraged to perform things that are not a good match for her talents.  When she has done small group guest shots, such as on Ray Brown's \\"Some Of My Friends Are the Singers,\\" I hear those talents I appreciated come back to life.  I would love to hear her return to the smaller jazz group approach.

B00005R62N|5.0|Make it this one.  It is quite possibly the most perfect heavy metal record ever recorded.  Rob Halford makes the tracks from Sad Wings, Sin After Sin, etc. come to life.  Every track is thrilling.  I tried to pick my favorite track from this album, but there is no way to pick just one.  Victim of Changes, Green Manalishi, Diamonds and Rust, Sinner...it's like the opposite of the Highlander: \\"There can only be all of them!\\"

B001PK47C6|5.0|Watchmen. Not only an excellent comic turned into movie, but the movie has an amazing soudtrack as well. Featuring 12 classic songs featuring among others Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen and Jimi Hendrix, the music is great, but what really makes this item worth the money is the production value. In true audiophilic style the vinyl weights in at 180 grams (meaning supreme quality), and has a really professional and well done mastering to it. The envelope is also amazingly done, with a cover that opens up to reveal original Watchmen art, a separate paper containing the track list and the such,    All in all, this is the only way to enjoy the Wathcmen soundtrack. Great music, supreme audioquality, and hardcore production value.
0618918248|5.0|I've read quite a few books on atheism and this is far and away superior. It's simply very well written, in plain English. It should be read by atheist and non-atheist alike.
0307473465|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book by a German about passionate love, complex guilt, and the Germans atrocities during WWII, themes that were cleverly interwoven by Schlink. The translation by Carol Brown Janeway is excellent. The book is in two parts. If you enjoy the first part you might also like to read \\"The Lover\\" by Marguerite Duras, excellently translated by Barbara Bray. The style of both original authors is quite different though. The brush with which Duras paints her story is very fine, and needs getting used to.

1416562605|3.0|On the cover of my edition is a winning recommendation from a USA Today reviewer: \\"One of the most powerful books I've read in decades. No hyperbole. This debut novel to me is like a kick in the head - the same effect of Richard Wright's, The Native Son and Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man had.\\" Really? I'd like to know the name of that reviewer so I could ask why they thought to include \\"no hyperbole\\" which their too rosy opinion of the book clearly was. I thought I was going to be reading a new World Lit Classic! I wish it were true. I did enjoy parts of the book; Adiga's description of the poverty of India's lower class was both stunning and repulsive. He also does a handy job of describing the utter corruption and turmoil that India faces from the lower castes to the highest. Yet I found the device of letter writing annoying and as the story unfolded, it just didn't seem plausible for the character to choose a foreign Prime Minister to confess to via letter. I think that is my main problem with the story. The way Adiga has painted the quiet, albeit internally grumbling, and subservient Balram make his choices that move the novel forward seem out of character. Particularly the turning point in his life from servant to master. Balram is a character who is constantly on the verge of two extremes, and as such, we never get to know him or even to like him. His reversal of fortune lacks depth and ends with a too neat little bow - when his whole life has been anything but. None of the characters have any redeeming qualities - and maybe that's the point - but then what is reading for if not to receive some enlightenment? Ellison or Wright, anyone?
B0015ABRE2|5.0|Dexter, Season 3 is more like a slow sizzle that slowly cranks up to it's amazing conclusion. Season 3 takes more time to develop the story as this time Dexter is trying to make a friend. Actually, Assistant District Attorney Miguel Prado is the one who is trying to force Dexter's hand in becoming best buds. Jimmy Smits should have won a slew of awards for his work on Season 3. He is amazing and drives the action forward with his slick work. I read somewhere the Jon Lithgow is going to be playing a serial killer on Season 4. Wow, can't wait.
B00243FQFA|5.0|THis series just got better and better and it is beyond me why they cancelled it. All the characters have their different personalities which expanded during the series. Some to the storylines were brilliant and my favorite was when Rodney had the parasite in his brain- David Hewlett's acting was phenomenal in that particular episode - worthy of an oscar We were so upset when it finished. Are there going to be any follow up episodes as they did with SG1 - why stop when it was so good - can't understand why. Beat Battlestar Galactica without any doubt - no comparison between the two series and to my mind got better as each season progressed. COme on writers get cracking on some follow up episodes like you did with SG1.
B000V86OKG|5.0|Season 2 sizzles right from the opening scene. Our man Dexter find his whole world turned upside down when the FBI joins forces with Miami P.D. hunting down the Bay Harbor Butcher who just so happens to be Dexter. Doakes (Eric King) is determined to get his man and he is just as determined that Dexter knows more then he is letting on. Special FBI agent Lundy (Keith Carradine) is also hot on the trail of the Bay Harbor Butcher and hot on the trail of Dexter's sister (Jennifer Carter) who is finding comfort in Lundy's security after her harrowing escape from the Ice Killer. Along comes a character Lila (Jamie Murray) who is going to turn Dexters' life even more upside down. From the first time we meet her, you sense trouble and Lila never disappionts. Dexter is tortured by questions of what to do this season and his own code of right and wrong and what he really wants. If you got hooked on Season 1 then buckle your seatbelt because Season 2 is a ride you don't want to miss.
B00288KNJU|5.0|When the movie started my first thought was - Tim Burton. The feel of the creatures, characters, effects, set, etc. was very reminiscent of Nightmare Before Christmas and the like - and seriously, the darkness that comes out in Coraline has a similar feel.<br /><br />PLOT: Coraline (not Caroline as many characters try to call her) finds herself in a rented home with a mysteriously secret door in the wall that leads to a parallel world - a parallel world that is dark and devilish. It's also a parallel world where everyone's eyes are buttons. Don't ask me why they are buttons - that was one of the mysteries of the movie that I never understood.<br /><br />Coraline must first figure out what is \\"wrong\\" in the parallel world, then figure out how to fix it, or perhaps get back to the safety and potential boredom of \\"reality\\".<br /><br />CHARACTERS: My favourite character was the cat. The creature was elegant, playful, offered both comic relief and insight, and was simply fun to watch. The animators spent a lot of time on that one and it was well worth it. Coraline was an interesting one - I didn't like her at first because I found her voice and her personality a bit irritating - but as the movie progressed and she discovered new things and grew, I found myself liking her more...even her wild blue hair. As for the other characters you will find a few women with VERY exaggerated breasts. It's not done in a sexual manner so you don't need to worry for kids, but it's very humorous (and you'll recognize the voices of Jennifer Saunders & Dawn French).<br /><br />ANIMATION: Superb, simply superb. The colours were vibrant and rich, the detail was amazing in even the smallest detail like a cat's whisker. Very impressive and stunning - as I said before, the cat was really quite cool.<br /><br />OVERALL RATING: I'm giving the movie 5 stars. My initial dislike of Coraline went away quickly, the detailed animation and very well written story made for a delightful evening. Even the minor issue of me not fully understanding the concept of the button eyes does not detract from the movie. (Maybe I need to read the book now and find out more) *** FUN FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY ***nor issue of me not fully understanding the concept of the button eyes does not detract from the movie.

B000006NPY|2.0|It deserves only 2 stars from me because out of 16 tracks, it only has 4 wonderful songs on it, To Sheila, Once Upon a Time, Apples + Oranjes, and Behold! The Night Mare.  Everything else sounds like uninspiring and lifeless folk music, with a few that are at least somewhat decent.  The music portrays a dark emotion and lacks catchiness, unlike previous Pumpkins albums.  This is the album that most likely made me lose interest in them, and I stopped following their music in later years.  I've only heard a few from Siamese Dream and I have Mellon Collie, and I can tell you immediately those are must have records, if you chose to be a fan.

B001GCUO1Q|4.0|I'm a huge fan of the entire X-Men genre.  This movie focuses on the necessary who, what where, when and why that should have been addressed in the original movie, but remained only hinted at concerning Wolverine's mysterious past. This movie (Finally!) brings in the other characters that all X-Men fans anxiously await with breathless eagerness--Gambit, Sabertooth, Silverfox are just to name a few.  Non stop action, thrills and one hell of an action film!
0307269981|3.0|I liked this one much better than The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, but my main complaint with that book does still apply here. I think Larsson does a great job writing complex thrillers, but he is obviously far more fascinated by his characters' personal lives than I am. I frequently find myself thinking \\"that's nice but get back to the story\\" which is never a good sign.
078324228X|5.0|The idea that a man would be strong enough to endure over 20 years in prison for a crime he didn't commit is ... what can one say ... remarkable.<br /><br />The other man arrested the night of the murders, John Artis, spent the same amount of time in prison as Carter.  In the voiceover commentary, director Norman Jewison points out that the authorities would periodically take John Artis to his home and tell him that all he had to do was sign a piece of paper stating that Ruben Carter commited the murders, and he would be set free.  Artis refused; the simple reason being that neither one of them committed the crime.  As Ruben Carter put it: \\"John Artis is my hero.\\"<br /><br />As much as I like this movie and as much as I would recommend that as many people as possible see it, the movie gives the impression that the railroading of Ruben Carter was rooted in a personal vendetta Patterson detective Vincetn Della had against Ruben Carter.  Not so.  Ruben Carter's case was not rooted in a personal vendetta, a judicial misstep or a \\"flaw\\" in the political system.  It was, rather a systematic, statewide attempt on the part of a *host* of New Jersey authorities to frame an innocent black man;  and to frame him because of his radical political views.<br /><br />Please Note: The United States was *founded* on radical political views.<br /><br />Ruben Carter was far from the only political prisoner in the United States in the 1960s.  U.S. jails were, and are, full of political prisoners, given that the United States government was and still is rooted in racial and economic injustice.<br /><br />Corrupt police, corrupt judges and corrupt politicians in the 1960s were given all kinds of signals from the ruling class that their fervor in maintaining \\"law and order\\" would grant them unconstitutional authority in applying and interpreting the law.<br /><br />Put another way: the tone established by those in power -- starting at the top with law and order, unindicted co-conspirator Richard Nixon -- \\"enabled\\" corrupt, vigilante officials to take the law into their own hands; even if their arbitrary, extralegal exercise of power meant innocents were convicted.<br /><br />Maintaining law and order, preserving \\"the system\\" were and are all that matter to the ruling elite.<br /><br />Martin Luther King, Jr., Malcolm X, Huey Newton, Fre Hampton, Medgar Evers, Michael Schwerner, James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, Louis Allen, Addie Mae Collins, Viola Gregg Liuzzo, Mack Charles Parker, Emmett Till, the four children who died on a Sunday morning in Birmingham, Alabama, and countless of other unknowns who were either lynched, imprisoned or murdered in cold blood -- these were political imprionments and political \\"hits.\\"<br /><br />-- Consider how \\"justice\\" was meted out to the men who killed the three civil rights workers in Philadelphia, Mississippi in 1964 (Schwerner, Chaney and Goodman).<br /><br />-- Consider Mayor Richard Daley's \\"shot to kill\\" order just before the antiwar marchers convened in Chicago in 1968 for the Democratic National Convention.<br /><br />-- Consider the Kerner Commission's characterization of what took place in the streets of Chicago during that 1968 Democratic Convention -- they described it as a \\"police riot.\\"<br /><br />-- Consider the attitude of the chief law enforcement officer, J. Edgar Hoover, toward Martin Luther King, Jr. and the civil rights movement in general.<br /><br />-- Consider the enabling message of people like *Governor* Orville Faubus, *Sheriff* Bull Conner, *Governor* George Wallace, \\"Governor* Lester Maddox, et al to the corrupt sheriffs, judges, police and politicians who went out of their way to punish \\"uppity blacks.\\"<br /><br />So it's not just one corrupt Patterson detective we're talking about; we're talking about the corruption of entire social, political and economic system -- a system that wanted to not just imprison Ruben Carter but to kill his political beliefs and kill the spirit that generated those beliefs.<br /><br />Ruben \\"Hurricane\\" Carter is an extraordinary person; extraordinary to have endured what he endured.  And he is celebrated for his endurance and for his courage.  But how many countless people are there -- unsung, unheard of -- who were killed, railroaded and/or imprisoned for crimes they didn't commit, who *didn't* survive as Ruben Carter survived?<br /><br />Quoting from a review by J. Cooper:<br /><br />\\"The film implies that the frame-up of Carter and Artis was unique<br />--an aberration of justice.  But as Carter was well aware in 1967, the state was out to crush the rising opposition simmering in the urban ghettos, and he was a prime target.  He was outspoken, bold and had spent much of his youth in a correctional facility. ...<br /><br />\\"He was also an outspoken critic of racial prejudice, and a supporter of the civil rights movement in the US from the early 1960s. ...<br /><br />\\"The political issues that agitated him and about which he felt passionate are left out of the film. ...<br /><br />\\"... the intolerable conditions of ghetto life.  These were the conditions that had formed young Rubin Carter: run-down apartments, unemployment over 20 percent, poor schools and little future for youth. ...<br /><br />\\"State forces were mobilized against the growing (civil right and antiwar) movement(s) through open police provocations, frame-ups and murders. ... This is the social background to the Carter and Artis case that is barely touched on by the film.  The audience is left to conclude that it was one bad cop and one angry black man locked in battle. ...<br /><br />\\"... the \\"guardian angel\\" jailer who helps Carter retain his dignity by bending the rules for him ... reinforces the artificial 'balance' that the filmmakers bring to the story in their attempt to demonstrate that ultimately the American Justice System \\"can work.'\\"
B001GQACGE|3.0|When I bought the double CD, I immediately went to the \\"Sasha Fierce\\" CD. Its filled with the type of Beyonce tunes that I enjoy, high energy-bass driven.  I enjoy \\"Ego\\", \\"Video Phone\\", \\"Diva\\", and \\"Scared of Lonely.\\"  Now for the \\"I Am...\\" (Beyonce) CD side.  Well, I have played that CD only two times.  The first time of course is the obligatory listen to see if I like any songs.  \\"If I Were A Boy\\" is cool, but that's about it. Some of them I can listen to again...maybe, but last week when I plugged in the CD (mind you this is after having it for about 3 months) I can't connect with it.  I enjoyed more of her slower songs on her first solo album vs. this one.  Overall, depending on what type of Beyonce tunes you enjoy, I'd just stick to the Sasha Fierce.

B001993Y2C|4.0|Honestly, I did not find the packaging of this set as abysmal as many reviewers here would have you believe.  The box itself does look rather large and clunky, however the lift-up top is an original idea and it does look quite futuristic, so I can't blame the designers for it.  As for the cardboard sleeves, they are a bit awkward, however the blu-rays are packaged in snugly, and as far as I see there is no way the discs could be scratched or broken inside the box. The only \\"risky\\" moment is when you try and take the actual discs out of the sleeve.  No episode lists or brochures inside is a definite minus, though - rifling through disc menus looking for the needed episode is no fun.  Nitpicking aside - the picture quality and sound on this set are astounding, and that's what matters to me the most.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|i didnt want to admit it at first but the ps3 L2 & R2 triggers are so poorly designed. playing a game like Burnout Paradise where you constantly have to hold R2, my finger would slide and my car would slow down causing me to lose the event. id have to hold my finger at weird angles just to get it to work right. yes you CAN play the ps3 without these. the question is: why would you?    now let me say that i have very poor experience with 3rd party accessories in the past so i was very skeptical about this product. i heard great things so i bought a single pair to try out. after a grueling run down of every type of game i could throw at it, i was left very impressed. i purchased this product for the rest of my controllers.    the product is very high quality. it feels just like the plastic used on the L2 & R2 buttons. its easy to assemble if you follow the directions. and most importantly they stay in place and dont slide around. i still prefer the shoulder buttons on my 360 controller but this product makes the ps3 controller a close second.
0307454541|5.0|The engaging Tattoo book has a better translated title than the original. The theme may be The Man who Hates Women but sounds offensive. The interesting story plot opens a slice of sexy, financial, computer-hacking life at odds with the average American. Larsson inserts new twists as soon as the reader grasps characters and events. A fast-paced start to the Millennium series.

0553582038|4.0|I have heaped piles of praise on George R.R. Martin for the first three books in his Song of Fire and Ice series but this time the gushing ends. It's not that the quality of his writing has diminished one iota. The problem is that the story seems to have lost all focus. When the series first started the author put the Stark family center stage, in particular the six children and their wolf familiars. By the fourth novel only two of the children (Sansa and Arya) even put in an appearance and neither has their wolf. The children's abilities to see and smell through their wolves, which had been an intriguing side story, never even gets a mention in this book.<br /><br />I got into the series way late so I just now finished the fourth book but I can only imagine the impatience of someone who's been waiting since 2005 particularly since many readers were under the impression that the fifth book was going to be released soon after the fourth. Apparently the book he wrote was SO large it had to be split into two volumes with each volume containing half the characters. Reader assumed that the second half of the book was probably close to complete instead it's been four years with no release date in sight. A Feast of Crows features no appearances by Jon Snow or Brandon Stark or Rickon Stark or my favorite character Tyrion Lannister. The entire storyline with Daenerys Targaryen has been put on hold. This means if you like those characters it's been nearly nine years since new material has arrived featuring them. As if to add insult to injury there are a whole pile of new, less interesting characters introduced. I don't understand why the author couldn't have just stayed with the existing characters rather than branch off into all sorts of different threads. I just can't keep track of it all. Another issue is that this is by far the least exciting of the four books. The war has wound down and quite frankly not much is happening. A lot of time is spent focused on Brienne of Tarth searching for Sansa Stark but like so many story threads it never has a satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />This is a hard book to review because the author is an extremely talented writer who can keep the readers engaged. Martin writes fantastic dialogue, he's excellent at describing scenes and setting a mood and he always manages to finish up with some great cliffhangers. George R.R. Martin is head and shoulders above any other fantasy writer I have read when it comes to sheer quality of writing. What's not so fun is that at the pace he has set, readers who read this book when it came out in 2005 would probably have to wait around a decade or so before the cliffhangers are resolved. It's very hard for me to recommend someone starting this series at this point. With each book I become less convinced that the series will ever be ended. As good as Tolkien was if he never wrote, `The Return of The King' the series would be a huge disappointment, forgotten in time. And The Lord of the Rings was far tighter. I wouldn't be surprised if many of the fans who read A Game of Thrones back in 1996 have since given up on the series or moved on with their lives. The worst thing is there is no indication of a conclusion any time soon and tentatively there are three more books scheduled to be released. To those who want to start reading the Song of Fire and Ice series I say do it at your own risk. On the other hand I intend to purchase book five as soon as it comes out so I can't say I'm not hooked but I didn't start the series 13 years ago.th searching for Sansa Stark but like so many story threads it never has a satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />This is a hard book to review because the author is an extremely talented writer who can keep the readers engaged.

While he is best known for his work in physics, this book deals with the man and not the science.  If you ever wanted to know how a genius thinks read this book.  I never know a genius could be so average.

As a band, the Dead were not always consistently good song-writers (their fame is based on their live shows, not their albums), so apart from \\"American Beauty,\\" there really is no one record that is going to blow away the casual listener. However, this is a solid collection that contains many of the band's best songs, as well as most of their hits.  I give it 4 instead of 5 stars because certain obvious inclusions are absent.  For instance, where is \\"Alabama Getaway,\\" or \\"I Need a Miracle\\"?  I am old enough to remember these songs getting tons of airplay on FM stations, so they certainly qualify as \\"hits.\\"  Still, a fine introduction to a great American band.
B0000009NQ|4.0|My new review (February 16, 2010)    Alright, I decided that the best way to hear what all the fuss is about concerning David Bowie's Heroes album is to listen to it 10 times in a row, so that's what I did, haha.   Doing so was the best thing I could have done- it honestly helped me remember how the songs go, so I think the album has finally clicked this time.   Read on to see my updated review below-    \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" is still a tad weak in the verse melody department, but the chorus is quite strong, so I guess I've warmed up to this song a bit.  \\"Joe the Lion\\" I *definitely* like significantly more than I did last time I heard it (about 10 years ago- yeah, it's been that long).  The song features quite a few vocal melody tricks in its short 3-minute span.  It's the way Bowie delivers the melody that was so perplexing to me for years.  I apologize for not hearing those tricks sooner.      Sorry, the title song still stinks to me- a synth riff that repeats in the most boring way imaginable for 6 minutes- not my thing.  Both Bowie and Eno should have known such a trick wouldn't work thanks to their previous efforts... oh who am I kidding?  Everyone loves it except for me.  Well, whatever then.      \\"Son of the Silent Age\\" has a really memorable -though screechy and somewhat annoying- chorus.  Love the verse melody though.  \\"Blackout\\" contains the same amount of creative tricks \\"Joe the Lion\\" did, which makes it quite hard to adjust to the noise factor of the vocals, but they *do* eventually click with time and patience.      The first four songs on the second side of the album are really good instrumentals, however \\"Moss Garden\\" definitely feels like the weakest of the bunch because it's trying to go for atmosphere above really neat and memorable instrumental chops, and well, Bowie was honestly not much in the atmosphere department was he?  Certainly no Pink Floyd.  Still a decent song.  My favorite is definitely \\"Neukoln\\".  What a WEIRD song that one is.\\"The Secret Life of Arabia\\" is awesome.  I have no idea why I had so much trouble getting into it- those vocals are golden.      So yeah, I did eventually warm up to this album but as you can see it took a long time.  Here's my OLD review below- don't pay attention to it, but I'll keep it up anyway because let's be honest, it took me more than a few minutes to write.  Unless you know a way to give me back all those wasted minutes?  Didn't think so, bub!    This is supposed to mark a distinct experimental period in Bowie's career (and a drastic change from his creative bursts on his previous albums) but this album leaves me pretty darn cold.  I hate the title song with its boring synth loop that repeats over and over.  It's supposed to contain some emotion in the lyrics and a catchy vocal melody but for whatever reason it leaves me completely cold.   It just sounds so dull to me.    \\"Joe the Lion\\" sounds like Bowie completely lost his singing voice.  Perhaps it's an intentional annoying singing style he's using for this track, but I still don't like it at all.  When I first heard this song after my friends praised it to the moon, I honestly began to think I was living in a completely different world from my friends.  \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" is probably the best song because it reminds me of a Moody Blues song from the early 80's (yeah I know this album came out first- I still like the Moody Blues song more).      Not sure what Bowie was going for on \\"Secret Life of Arabia\\".  I think I like \\"Blackout\\".  Probably the best song on the album.  Take that for what its worth.    I love Space Oddity, Man Who Sold the World, Hunky Dory, Aladdin Sane, Let's Dance, Scary Monsters, and even Lodger.  Something about Heroes just never appealed to me.  After all these years I still can't get warmed up to it.  That's a sign I'm just not meant to like it.

The characters were fresh and new, as was the story line. I hated to come to the end.
B000LC3ID8|3.0|The Bottom Line:    Ahhh the halcyon days of 2006, when the ridiculous Saw franchise was somewhat less ridiculous for its villain was at least not killing people from beyond the grave; Saw III is certainly no great film (it's not even a good film) but with a plot that makes a reasonable amount of sense and a couple creatively grisly scenes, it's at least better than IV or V.    2/4
0143038583|5.0|I had already read Fast Food Nation, and have been off fast food and soda for over 9 years, so at first, I thought this book wouldn't have anything new for me. I was WRONG! Pollan puts his money where his mouth is (literally!) and tracks his food down to its origins. I already knew about HFCS invading our food, but this book details how it came to pass. The writing is engaging, informative, witty, and extraordinarily well researched. It's no wonder Pollan has become as popular as he is, his fame is well deserved and rightly earned.  So, if you are already on the local/organic/anti-processed bandwagon, this book is still a great read that offers lots of nuanced research into the food chain. If you are still tossing down McDonalds, then this is REQUIRED reading! If you have come so far as to read these reviews, then you should just go all the way: buy this book, it will change your life for the better.

B001684L0A|4.0|What sets this apart from other HBO series is in the remarkable casting for this film. Linney & Giamatti are simply fantastic as one of history's best couples. Wilkinson was genius as Franklin (as Wilkinson always is), and Morse was as the second coming of Washington himself. I was taken back by the quality of acting in this series, and their ability to capture the spirit of the times. Also, the blue-ray edition looks and sounds wonderful. Even on my 720p screen, the story really comes to life.    These significant strengths aside, this is a historical film and historical films deserve accuracy. Of course, history is generally a subjective proposition, and is subject to one's interpretation. However, some of the creative \\"license\\" used in this production are significant deviations from what really happened. Consult IMDB for some specifics, they are too numerous to mention here. The most egregious, in my opinion, is in the depiction of Adams, most notably his interactions with his wife and friends. I concede that he was guilty of a hot temper, and at rare times actually demonstrated a complete lack of common sense. However, I perceive the marriage between the two to be far more harmonious that depicted here. I do not contend there was no conflict between the two, but I believe the depiction of Adams, and his temper and big mouth, were more caricature and exaggeration than how I understand he really was. This may be simply my own interpretation, but I know I am not alone in this criticism of the film.    Ultimately, this film is worthwhile for history buffs, and novices alike. I would encourage fans of the film to red this wonderful book to see what really happened, and how these people really lived. I thank HBO, McCullough, and all those involved in this film for keeping the spirit of Revolutionary America alive. In this day of Homeland security, national id's and police checkpoints, I believe we should remember the sacrifices of our founding fathers, and how precious out freedom really is.
B000UJ48XG|5.0|Listening to The Flying Cup Club crystallized an old memory from my undergraduate college days (long, long ago).  I was taking a philosophy course on aesthetics.  On the first day, the professor asked: \\"What separates animals from people?\\"<br /><br />Some of the class resorted to an answer that relied on biology, which was the same thing as answering \\"nothing.\\"  Some said tool use was a distinctive trait of people.  This was just plain wrong.  They had forgotten watching chimps on nature documentaries use grass stalks to fish termites out of their mounds.  I also didn't have a good answer.  Class dismissed without a valid response.  Only while walking away from class that afternoon did the answer occur to me: art.  Art is the one activity that differentiates humans from the rest of the living world.<br /><br />The work of Beirut is a monument to humanity's claim of singularity.  It conveys a deep sense of longing that transmutes a morning commute in a used sedan into a beautiful event.  It draws inspiration from a reality that claims civility as a virtue and talent as the key to success.  It is a reality we need.  Go buy it.
0307278255|5.0|I'm not much for short stories, but I make an exception for any book written by Jhumpa Lahiri.  I think that Unaccustomed Earth is even better than her Pulitzer Prize-winner, Interpreter of Maladies.<br /><br />Unaccustomed Earth consists of eight stories that touch on the universal themes of life and death, arranged marriages versus love matches, mixed marriages and unfaithful partners, obedient children and wayward children, and looking for happiness in the face of loneliness.  But Lahiri's books are also  colored with the hues of Bengali culture--food, clothing, traditions, etc.  It is this difference (along with her beautiful prose) that makes her stories so rich.<br /><br />The last three stories could be a novella and are my favorites.  Hema and Kaushik are thrown together as children, but then don't see each other for decades.  They each have a chapter in their own voice.  The final chapter has them together as adults as they look back over their lives and try to determine their futures.  The ending is especially moving.<br /><br />Jhumpa Lahiri writes more beautifully than almost any modern-day author.  She also expertly and simply describes the feelings of every-day people.  When a widower-father visits his daughter, he thinks that \\"he wanted to shield her from the deterioration that inevitably took place in the course of a marriage, and from the conclusion he sometimes feared was true: that the entire enterprise of having a family, of putting children on this earth, as gratifying as it sometimes felt, was flawed from the start.\\"<br /><br />Unaccustomed Earth has received numerous awards and has been on several prestigious book lists as one of the best books of 2009.  I would have to agree.

B00000J9HF|3.0|Reading the reviews I think this Rigoletto is a typical \\"love or hate\\" case. Since the lovers are in greater number by far, I'll shoot my hating bullets in first place.<br /><br />The sound quality is mediocre, not in the  league of other 1980 ADD good recordings. Soft passages are inaudible, so you must turn volume up, but then orchestral tutti are annoyingly loud with noticeable distortion (not my Stereo's fault).  I'm talking about the Deutsche Grammophon 2 CD full price package released in 1990. There's a new 1999 release, which I haven't  heard, that could already solve some of these problems, I don't know.<br /><br />Placido Domingo slightly stressed, slightly suffering tenor is not adequate to perform the Duca. Just that. The Duca must be an arrogant master, \\"young, gay, powerful, handsome\\", says Verdi, so you can't sing his part like an insecure Nemorino. No, no, no! And as high notes were always a problem to Domingo, he simply shouts them out. Terrible. BTW, don't wait for high notes which are not in Verdi's original score, though they're usually done by singers like Sutherland, Milnes or Kraus: Giulini banned them all (thanks God, Placido).<br /><br />Cappuccilli is a great singer, and he must have been a wonderful Rigoletto. But in this recording he's too restrained, his dark voice sounds a little choked sometimes, and he doesn't deliver quite a passionate, moving Rigoletto. Too much care to some details, too much thinking, too much Giulini, resulting in a kind of  bloodless performance.<br /><br />But have some lover bullets too: Cotrubas is very good, so is Ghiaurov and the rest of the big names cast, and Giulini is quite successful in some orchestral and choral passages, revealing unknown treasures to me. Cute. But the overall performance is dull.<br /><br />For HiFi buffs, I would recommend the Nucci-Pavarotti or the Milnes-Pavarotti recordings instead of this one, but my all time favorite Rigoletto is the old Bastianini-Kraus-Scotto-Gavazzeni, which I had first in Columbia LP's and now in a Dischi Ricordi 2 CD set, with italian-only libretto. This one is really marvelous, and the 1959 sound, though far from perfect, is better balanced than Giulini's.in a Dischi Ricordi 2 CD set, with italian-only libretto.

B000002VQQ|2.0|This release preens personality over songwriting content, making it sound more feminist victory than triumphant recording, with pretentious ramblings over slightly edgy songwriting simplicities creating the embraced illusion of something far less authentically gritty than posited.
B000002BVN|4.0|This is a very good album mainly due to the 5 new songs. The title song is such a superb dance number, stylish, groovy and with awesome beats. Don't know why he didn't put it in History album. Morphine is a great song, very creative, and sadly its tells MJ's own story as it he goes to sing \\"demerol, demerol, oh God he's taking demerol\\". Ghosts is very catchy, and MJ's has shown some of his best dance moves in its video. Is It Scary is a true gem. MJ's vocals are at their best and lyrics tell how much pain he was in due to media and ignorance of people. That time people didn't care but now if you listen it it brings tears to eyes realizing how much trouble MJ was in and no one cared. It is a haunting song. Superfly Sister is catchy though it is my least favorite among the five. From the remixes for me the best are History and Earth Song, the rest are okay.

0060557818|4.0|Believe me, I'll never look at a crack in the sidewalk again without thinking about this book.  That's the highest testimony I can give to how captivating this novel was for me.  It made me think about all the things that I, you, and Richard Mayhew had never even considered.  Richard didn't have the slightest idea that an entire world existed in London Below.  How could he when he was so involved in his own life in London Above?  Who goes around thinking about an entire other world existing for those who literally slip through the cracks?<br /><br />Neil Gaiman gave me a creepy, scary glimpse into that darkest part of an imaginary London.  The characters he invented for this story are wonderful.  I loved watching Richard grow and mature and see him become a person to be relied upon.  I loved Old Bailey with his feather coat and his birds for sale.  I loved the marquis de Carabas who was so very bad and yet somehow so very good.  I loved Hunter with her single minded focus and I would have been glad to \\"dispatch\\" Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar myself.  Two meaner, nastier villains I have yet to meet.  Strangely enough, it was the character of Door whose personality seemed to elude me more than any other.  Maybe I should read the book again.  There must have been aspects of her that I missed while I was so busy imagining that there might, just might, possibly be a London Below.<br /><br />This book has to be a fantasy readers delight.  Expect to be entertained, you won't be disappointed.

B001MYIXAC|5.0|**The following review pertains to a DVD release of the film featuring the original \\"theatrical subtitles\\". I can't pass comment on the 'hacked about' subtitles that appeared on the original US domestic release DVD of the film as I haven't seen it; but I am led to believe that it vastly changes the timbre and tone of the film as much of the more nuanced dialogue is sacrificed. Seek out the original \\"theatrically subtitled\\" version where you can.**    Oskar is a bullied twelve year old who lives with his mother in a council estate in the Blackeberg suburb of Stockholm. His life is a painful litany of physical abuse at the hands of his peers, over-mothering, and impotent rage expressed through the collection of articles about serial killers from newspapers and magazines.     However Oskar's life is to be forever changed by the arrival of the new girl next door, Eli - who is something far more and also far less than she appears...    Tomas Alfredson's film of \\"Let The Right One In\\" is a lyrical, poetic, deliberately ambiguous adaptation of John Ajvide Lindqvist's novel. Adapted for the screen by Lindqvist himself, the film is far more focussed on experience of childhood (through the travails of Oskar and Eli) and decidedly less focussed on the lives of tertiary adult characters such as the 'Sun Palace' regulars (Jocke, Lacke, Virginia, Morgan and Larry).    That is not to say that this isn't a faithful adaptation of the novel - it is. It's just that Alfredson and Lindqvist have quite wisely realised that film is a very different medium to literature and in paring down the sub-plots, and characters at work within them, they throw the themes and concerns of the novel into sharp relief in a way that would probably only have been possible to achieve through the medium of a television mini-series had they retained the depth and multitude of sub-plots and characters from the original book. Purists may bemoan the absence of a number of characters (Oskar's wayward adolescent neighbour and his rigid policeman stepfather are nowhere to be seen, and Hakan's obscene sexual predilections have been excised and his character subtly reinterpreted in a way that may suggest that he and Oskar may have a lot more in common than is at first apparent) and sub-plots (the zombie-style rampage of a character who has received Eli's sanguine attentions has been removed; and what has been perceived by many to be the novel's most controversial twist is vaguely alluded too rather than explicitly stated), but to my mind, this only strengthens the film as one focuses directly on the uniquely un-sugared vision of a world seen though a child's eyes. The only other film that I can think of that has so perfectly provided a window into the experience of childhood is Terry Gilliam's stunning, [[ASIN:B000KB4898 Tideland (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]]    Performances are extraordinary. Lina Leandersson is perfectly cast as Eli and she uses her strange, otherworldly - but rather pretty - young face to dynamic effect. At no point did I relate to her as a child actress; she really 'is' Eli.  Similarly, Kare Hedebrandt perfectly captures all the naivety, rage and introspective joy of Oskar's lonely young soul.    The period setting of Stockholm in 1981 is perfectly captured. I grew up on a council estate in the UK in the early 1980's and was stunned by how the Swedish council estate in th film evoked the look and feel of my own experience growing up 'on the block'. Similarly, the fashions of the clothes and décor of the time are perfectly evoked to the point that I forgot that I was watching a film made in 2008 rather than a period piece.     In terms of set-pieces, I was expecting a lot from this film, in particular from the swimming pool sequence towards it's end - and it delivered. Boy, did it deliver. That one sequence alone was worth purchasing the film in my opinion. It really did feel like I was watching exactly what I had envisioned when I read the book.     Although not to everyone's taste, if you're in the mood for a beautifully filmed, languidly paced examination of young love and the loneliness of childhood (or is it a chilling portrait of the emotional manipulation of an isolated, vulnerable young boy by a ruthless predator that just appears to be a twelve year old girl? or even an allegorical tale of the primoridal manifestation of a wounded anima?) with some oblique horrific overtones, then you could do a lot worse than to pick this film up.     A word of warning for more impressionable viewers though. This film has haunted my waking hours in the week or so since I've watched it and has effected me in a way that no film - not even Darren Aronofsky's [[ASIN:B00005Q4CS Requiem for a Dream (Director's Cut)]] or Gaspar Noe's [[ASIN:B00009W0U4 Irreversible]] - ever has before. It may be the air of nostalgic melancholia, the pervasive sense of loneliness that haunts every frame, or it may just be due to some unresolved issues from my own childhood, but be careful of this one - it gets into your head. That said, it may well now be my favourite film of all time.     If you're a fan of the novel - consider it a must-see.
1594202249|5.0|Pynchon's latest offering is a parody of Hard-Boiled Detective Fiction set in 1970 L.A. -- think 'Sam Spade on Acid' and you begin to get the vibe. A Hippie PI gets a case from an old flame, and matters quickly snowball in complexity (and body count) as he delves deeper into the seamy world of real estate development, surf rock, and a Triad-like crime clan run by dentists.<br /><br />This is quite likely Pynchon's most \\"accessible\\" novel to date, as it lacks much of the convoluted prose and obscure period-piece references that are the hallmark of his other works. Fans need not worry: Pynchon's penchant for silly character names, absurd song lyrics, and random trivia are here in spades, but given the setting it's quite likely that most readers will actually recognize the refs, and if you're over 30 it'll probably knock the cobwebs of your memory with a grin and go \\"oh yeah, I remember that...\\"<br /><br />Unlike most of his other books, which take a while to get rolling, this one pulled me right in, and I finished it in 2 days. If you've never read Pynchon, this is a great place to start, though a bit atypical of his other material. Actually, it reminded me of Crying of Lot 49, which is also a mystery, though this is surreal for different reasons -- usually involving the letters THC. Obviously, given the setting, there's a lot of stoner humor in it, and if that is not your cup of tea it'll definitely put you off, but otherwise absolutely give it a go.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

Plus, I own or have read most of the modern variations of all the Jane Austen novels.  I also own both the DVD and VHS versions of the BBC Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth.  That being said, I am delighted to have found this DVD.  It is charming and funny and you find yourself hoping that the lead will indeed capture Darcy's heart over Elizabeth Bennett.

B000003EUL|4.0|Richter's complaint that Liendsdorf pushed the pace seems right to my ears. I feel it. It's just a little too fast, not much... like someone standing too close behind you in line. The Brahms I've come to know seems a little more languid and flowing and just a little behind a pace that might feel comfortable to most listeners. A little to slow on purpose I think was a tactic Brahms used to confound expectations and seduce his listeners into the sonic enlightenment he understood so well. My favorite Brahms 4th Symphony, Szell/Cleveland, is quite a bit longer and slower than others I own.     The dynamics of this version's piano and orchestra are also more sharply staccato than most Brahms - rather than the rounder bolder majestic legato Brahms I know.    None the less, this is a fascinating and gorgeous interpretation that had the hair on my neck standing on end. Well recorded too. I think Brahms himself would have been surprised and intrigued. Interesting.

B000002AGN|5.0|Dave Brubeck's \\"Time Out\\" is one of the icons of jazz. Recorded fifty years ago, it contains some of the most well-known and well-loved jazz songs ever written, such as Blue Rondo a la Turk, and Take Five. And while any jazz fan will certainly have this in his or her collection, those same fans might also not give this a spin very often. Truly, this deserves frequent listening, as the music develops and weaves unexpectedly even as the listener grows more familiar with it. Paul Desmond's plaintive sax work in response to Brubeck's insistent solo passages, and the give and take of all the musicians, who always try to give a little more than they took from the last guy to solo, just keeps the music fresh, alive, and exciting every time one listens to it. Although there were many great jazz albums recorded during the same year as this, including the equally legendary [[ASIN:B000002ADT Kind of Blue]], this recording is decidedly in the upper echelon of the all time great jazz recordings list. If you don't own this, you need to, if you do own it, put it in your CD player today. Either way, you won't regret it.

It was such a pleasant surprise to pick up the book, begin reading, and realize just how beautiful the book was written, full of insight and pearls of wisdom, and very allegorical.  Because of the simplicity of the writing, it reminded me of one of my most beloved books, To Kill A Mockingbird.  I have recommended the book to all of my friends and hope that they receive as much joy and hope from the story as I did.
076790592X|5.0|Tuesdays with Morrie: An Old Man, a Young Man, and Life's Greatest Lesson.  It's not a long book. It's a fairly short, easy read with a powerful message.  I would highly recommend it to everyone.  I loaned it to a friend and she loaned it to her friend, and so on and so on.  It's a great story!
1416562605|4.0|My wife and I travel frequently around the world, but I must admit some of the best trips I have taken have been while reading a good book about exotic places in the world. \\"White Tiger\\" was one of those books.  Adiga not only transports readers to India through well written descriptions of scenes in villages and cities in India, it also gives readers great insight into what drives the people of India, the culture and the politics of the country. These later aspects are not so easy to acquire through a trip as a tourist.     India, by far the poorest and most populated democracy with diverse ethnic backgrounds is a unique country. Graft threatens the rise of India. Adiga does an outstanding job depicting the prevalence and the contagious nature of corruptness. This lack of ethical behavior is not just contained to politics but even to within families and between employers and employees in the private sector. Adiga shows readers how blackmailing and later the associated resentments arise.  O f course corrupt behavior exists all over the world and Adiga does a beautiful job in explaining how it evolves in India which can be equally applicable to anyplace in the world.    The narrator, Balram, is a poor village person who \\"rises\\" to become the driver of a wealthy family. Early in the book we find out (this is not a spoiler) that he killed his boss. This creates curiosity and suspense for readers. The different levels of poverty that Adiga demonstrates to readers reminded me of Rohinton Mistry's outstanding book, \\"A Fine Balance\\". When you think Balram has it really bad you witness people who have it far worse. Adiga is a very good writer, but not quite the level of Mistry. The book is written as a letter to China's Premier, Wen Jiabao. I did not care for the format. At times it drags on a bit but overall, I highly recommend it both for entertainment and also understanding India better.
B001OQCV9M|4.0|Nora Ephron has literally hit the nail on the head with this production. Two stories that blend beautifully together with a terrific editing job that never lets the viewer lose track.    Yes, Meryl Streep is Julia. She delivers an over-the-top performance with some great comedic moments.    Given the task of a more reality based character and situation Amy Adams more than holds her own with the part of Julie.     The one complaint here is Stanley Tucci who should have received star billing along with the ladies. His performance as Julia's husband was impeccable. A fine actor cast well for this role.    The soundtrack, although adequate, was a bit \\"cheesy\\" and left a lot to be desired in the forwarding of a double storyline.    Not to be missed. We should hope for a DVD release with some wonderful Commentary.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|As a healthcare worker this movie helped to feature and identify things that I see everyday.  Truly amazing!  I watched it on TV and immediately ordered the movie to pass around to all of my friends and coworkers.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|This is a great concert. There are elements of the previous tour, Bad, and the future tour History. The set list is not incredible, most of the songs he sings on all 3 tours, but Dangerous does introduce Black and White, Heal the World, Will You Be There and Man in the Mirror. You can't go wrong with any MJ show DVDs or movies.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|It is my all time favorite movie.  I am a grandpa and loved reading Betrix Potter's stories to my kids and grandkids.
0316017922|5.0|One of my students recommended book to me.  He didn't have to pull my arm to buy, because I had read \\"The Tipping Point\\" and loved it so I was aware of the author.  In fact, I knew about the book but just hadn't bought yet.    I'm glad my student nudged me.  I just finished reading Outliers and absolutely loved it. Although he meticulously researches his material and interjects it into the reading, his storytelling and ease of talking \\"reasearch\\" in terms that average persons can relate to, makes the reading easy and memorable.  His books make a big impact to encourage the reader to view the world differently.  I am recommending the book to all my friends and colleagues.    Pamela Payne Foster, author of \\"Is there a balm in Black America?\\"
1400063515|5.0|\\"The Black Swan\\" is Monumental. It's needed to remind us of what we often forget and over-look in life.  Too many facts and concepts in this book to list.  You can read the \\"The Black Swan\\" in any order, and the sub-chapters within the main chapters are also mini-chapters, which can be read in any order.  You can do this by using the Index to find the concepts and topics you want to learn about.  Many reviews are about the concept of the Black Swan itself, Medicristan and Extremistan.  Below are a few of the other things noted.     Linear vs. Non-Linear:    With linearities the relationships between variables are clear, crisp, and constant.  But Taleb notes quite accurately that non-linear relationships in our world are far more common.  Unfortunately, we humans are programmed for many reasons to incorrectly think the world's non-linear phenomena operate in linear fashion.  Also, in our education system we focus on linear relationships because they're easier to understand.      A few of the many points by Taleb:      OSTRACISM:    \\"A school allow someone with unusual ideas with the remote possibility of a payoff to find company and create a microcosm insulated from others.  The member of the group can be ostracized together - which is better than being ostracized alone\\" (p. 94).      TREND FORECASTERS: Get Another Job.    Taleb accurately claims with empirical evidence that forecasters are usually wrong, no matter who they are, and no matter what their erudite and expertise background is.  How right he is.  He accurately cites that forecasters are entertainers.  And most, charlatans.      To Quote: \\"Do not listen to economic forecasters or to predictors in social science (they are merely entertainers)....know how to rank beliefs not according to their plausibility but they the harm they may cause\\" (p. 203).     And most importantly, Taleb notes that in regard to Black Swans and future trend forecasters that \\"Knowing that you cannot predict does not mean that you *cannot* benefit from unpredictability\\" (page 203).      HUMANS FEEL THE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THINGS THAT ARE NOT UNDERSTANDABLE:    It's OK not to understand or not know about many of the phenomena in our world.  But we humans do try to \\"explain\\" many things in our world and universe that are not explainable.  Under the Black Swan mentality, it's OK not to now.  It's OK not to understand.  When it comes to the concept of Uncertainty, that's OK, too.       INTERESTING LITTLE THINGS I LEARNED:    * a 'googol' is the number 1, with 100 zeroes    * 'bildungsphilisters' are people who read dogma-prone newspapers and go to operas who have cosmetic exposure to culture and are shallow.  They are learned philistines.  This can include those in academia.  They have the Ph.D but lack erudition, and their curiosity is closely centered on his/her ideas. p.131    In my opinion this book is a classic for modern times. We are bombarded with tons of information by \\"experts\\" on a daily basis.  Experts explaining the present, past, and predicting the future.  The medium on this superficial level is the Mainstream Media.  At the esoteric level, it's university experts.  They are both more same than different, in general.    One of the hundreds of quotes in \\"The Black Swan\\" is the point that: \\"knowing that you cannot predict does not mean that you cannot benefit from unpredictability.\\"  I and most readers, have experiences this, small and big.     A Classic.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I have to say that this BBC series left me with tears streaming from my eyes. Partially because my eyes were thoroughly irritated but also because this was such a well told story which came out splendidly on screen. Many of the characters left a bold impression upon me from Dixon the servant to Lennox Margaret's forlorn suitor. The cinematography was excellent and the detail was exquisite.  I'm really surprised how much ground the story covered from a historical perspective. I'm not a history buff so I don't know much about it other than the basics but they hit issues with the union, speculation, exhibitions... It was quite educational so I don't feel so bad about enjoying the romance. ^_^
0887081770|1.0|One of my favorite books for children - but NO WHERE did it say that this HARDCOVER book was 3 inches high and wide!  Ridculous!  I like small books too, but that was NOT what I thought I'd ordered.  BAD DESCRIPTION!

B001OBT3FC|5.0|Let the concert come to you.    The quality of this Blu-Ray disc is impeccable. Filmed in Full HD 1080P and with a lossless 5.1 PCM or 2.0 PCM soundtrack, you may as well be a member of the audience. There is something incredibly invigorating seeing a premier orchestra in full flight, with excellent camera-work to match. The sound in the rear is more than just ambient and you truly feel surrounded.    Don't get me wrong - I would have killed to be in the Musikverein that evening, but this is definitely the next best thing.    This was a truly special concert, and Anne-Sophie Mutter gives a thrilling account of the Beethoven Concerto, magnificently supported by von Karajan protegee Seiji Ozawa and the Berliners. The Tchaikovsky 6th is no less transporting.    It is a great pity, that at time of writing this, you can count on one hand the number of Blu-Ray releases of orchestral performances - and still have a finger or two left over. I hope for more in the future, for all of us who cannot slip into the Concertgebouw, the Berlin Philharmonie or the Vienna Musikverein whenever we feel like it.    5 stars for the picture quality  5 stars for the photography  5 stars for the audio quality  5 stars for the performances    A must-buy for Blu-Ray and Classical lovers.
B002E2QHBS|5.0|Despite everyone's desire to have selected this comp, the producers did an admirable job. Sure it's not perfect but so what. As one reveiwer said just sit back and enjoy the music. There's a lot of it here. With this comp things are assembled in context. Depsite the technichal difficulties, the Arlo Guthrie material is excellent, as is Baez. When you hear Bert Sommer you wonder why you never heard more of him or why you never heard him at all. The extra stage announcements coupled with the movie help fill in the broader picture. This deseves an A just for the mamouth task completed.. Sound quality is greatly improved. At times it has the qaulity of feild notes. Eat that document. It's worth it.
B0012GN3XM|5.0|One other customer here articulated the same view I've always had about Santana as a 1990s \\"musical revolutionary\\". Back in the '90s, I was listening to some youthful \\"expert in pop culture\\" blathering about what a \\"breakthrough\\" album the later \\"Supernatural\\" was for Latino artists, not even noticing that the term \\"breakthrough\\" is a borrowed corporate hype used by record companies to manipulate the public into buying a product they want to push. And this album, like that fellow customer says, is a great example of how that hype has people overlooking earlier masterpieces. I had this album on my MP3 player this morning and I had confused the opening number \\"Changes\\" with the Buddy Miles classic \\"Them Changes\\" that Carlos joined him in for the famous Diamond Head concert--instead, this one is the old Cat Stevens great (sorry, Cat--I ain't gonna call you \\"Yusuf\\"), which retains the hypnotic Bo Diddley beat from the original. Much is said about younger minor league artists \\"paying their dues\\" before graduating into their own creative voice, but it's a mark of greatness in and of itself when an established veteran like Carlos gives recognition to work created by others. Carlos even bases his guitar solo on Stevens' vocal \\"woh-woh-woh\\" riff in the original. Later in this album, \\"Winning\\" is a great combination of Phil Collins' and Steve Winwood's habit of putting keyboard hooks under the vocal that become just as important as the melody. Anyway, when the young \\"rock ideologue\\" I spoke of earlier in this review hit me with his self-serving rhapsodizing, I said; \\"Son, I was listening to Carlos Santana before you were born, and not because he's Mexican--but because he's GREAT, and was great even back in my day as well.\\"
B0028RXXFC|5.0|As I upgrade my DVD collection to Blu Ray I have not thought to upgrade any of my series. Not Battlestar Galactica, not Smallville, not Supernatural. Now I thought about getting True Blood but just couldn't bite the bullet. However, with Rome soon to be released, that is going to change. Rome is not only a great series but it follows the rise of the Empire in Roman history to the letter. It does it with two fictional characters as the protagonists and interweaves them with the key players in the first and second Triumvirate and in the process makes what was boring in Western Civilization a joy to watch. I heartily recommend this series to anyone who has never seen it and encouraging anyone with a HDTV to make this their first HD series purchase.
B001ILHY1I|5.0|I don't know how to properly give this movie it's proper due except to say that it is a thoroughly enjoyable sphincter-tightening thrill ride from beginning to end, a guilty pleasure that can best be described with awesome aspects of other movies.<br /><br />Death Race is:<br />The isolation of [[ASIN:6305173966 No Escape]]<br />The armor, weapons, and carnage of the cars in [[ASIN:B00127S3A4 Twisted Metal]]<br />The criminal game show of [[ASIN:0451197968 The Running Man]]<br />The car racing of [[ASIN:B00000ILBL Days of Thunder]] and [[ASIN:6305263248 Ronin]]<br />The post-apocalyptic car designs of [[ASIN:0790729342 The Road Warrior]]<br />The on-road power-ups of [[ASIN:B00002SVFR Super Mario Kart]]<br />The British dude of [[ASIN:B00008AOVL The Transporter]]<br />The T&A of [[ASIN:B002AT4K9G Fast & Furious]]<br />The brutal, realistic fights of [[ASIN:B001TODCII Taken]]<br /><br />What else could you want?

B000ECXWVI|3.0|You already know who directed it and who the stars are. So, I won't bore you with already kinown info regarding this film. All I will say is this, I have watched war films for over 30 years and was somewhat disappointed with \\"Windtalkers\\". I was not sure how a director like John Woo would visualize this film with his particular flare... but he did a fair job, considering he ended up making this film a strict action film with very little drama or character study... Don't get me wrong, Woo is an awesome director, but this was not his film...<br /><br />Nicolas Cage, is a good actor, but this was the most over the top performance I've seen him do... and was disappointed with that. I think he could have done better, especially with a better script.<br /><br />Christian Slater, for me was way out of place in this film. He just was not believable or seemed like a real person, but just an actor playing a character... This was not Slater's film...<br /><br />All in all... this film was somewhat of a let down. There is no realism to the sotry or the characters. There is not chemistry between anyone. The battle scenes were of the Woo shoot-em-up style, but were almost way too long and anti-climatic without the intensity or realisim of \\"Saving Private Ryan\\"...<br /><br />This film story of Navajo codetalkers in World War 2 would have been way better with a Steven Speilberg type director and a more character driven script and a little less on the shoot-em-up action...<br /><br />A so-so film... nothing more, nothing less than that!

B000W91RUG|5.0|I just catch one episode one day in one of my flights. Since there was nothing on tv after Friends I have finally found the replacement: BBT is an excellent show, I sometimes don't get the jokes which makes it even more fun, because I have to rewind over and over to get them.   Sheldon is my favorite character but they are all great. I cannot wait to have the second season.
B00004XQP4|1.0|Listed as like new condition, this was false, CD had several scratches on it and the graphics were faded from being in the sun, like it had been stored in one of those automobile visor cd files
B000069HJM|4.0|This is a very good album, with some strong songs, mostly sung by Rick Davies who was a big part of the old Supertramp magic. I can`t understand why it has received  so much criticism, like Slow Motion, it is a classic. Some fans miss Roger and fair enough, he was fifty per-cent of the old vocal sound but this is well worth buying and I hope Rick turns out some more like it.
B00005JMUA|3.0|This movie is not as good as the first but the quality of the dvd that I received was great.
0385341008|5.0|Initially, I was intrigued by the odd title of this book.  Since I generally tend to shy away from \\"trendy\\" books, I didn't pick this one up right away.  I have determined however that if something is this popular, there is generally a reason!  This book was amazing and I read it in about 4 hours!  The story just grabs you and you want to find out what happens next.  I kept reading just one more page, even though I was on vacation at the lake with a million things to do.<br /><br />The story revolves around post-WWII Guernsey, an island in the English Channel, and its inhabitants.  An English writer is contacted by one of these residents and a \\"love affair\\" with all things Guernsey begins for her.  This book has everything you want in a good read...romance, adventure, heartache, mystery, and more!  You won't be sorry you picked this one up!
B001OD6HO0|5.0|This double LP set is just amazing, especially with the remixes. Just pure gold! can you really beat that price of $20 here on amazon for a double LP? I bought mine at Rasputin for $17.99 but still this is a steal, if you are a Katy Perry fan then just buy this, and you will tank yourself once your stylus touches this Lp for the first time.  Enjoy
B000001EC1|5.0|I was raised on this album.  I came to love every single song on this album, which is a colletion of Bon Jovi songs.  It's a joy to finally be able to hear this album again.  As I listen to the songs with more mature ears, I find that some of the songs are good but not great.  But they will always be amazing to me since I've been listening to them since I was little.    If you are a Bon Jovi fan, you will probably appreciate this collection, or if you're new to the band, it's good to that too (it introduced me to Bon Jovi).
B0019LY5I2|4.0|This film is big, flashy, and a ton of fun. The Paris chase setpiece was surprisingly well done.

0765356139|3.0|The Well of Ascension is a fun and occasionally funny book with a lot to like. First and foremost, there's the plot. Unexpected things keep happening, few of the plot twists are predictable, and there are plenty of secrets; I get the feeling the author has read a lot of mysteries. Besides which, things happen that you don't often see in fantasy (or anywhere else for that matter)... for instance, between the end of last book and the beginning of this one, Elend has turned Luthadel into a sort of constitutional monarchy, and a church has sprung up worshipping Kelsier, and by extension Vin.... when's the last time you saw that in a book?<br /><br />Second, the main characters are endearing. You care about them because they're likeable people, and in over their heads without being annoying about it. It's fun to read about them and watch their relationships develop; I know a lot of people aren't looking to read long conversations between Vin and her canine kandra and have accused the book of being boring, but I enjoyed it.<br /><br />Third, the author just seems smarter about real life than a lot of others out there. He realizes, for instance, that if you eliminate the emperor without replacing him, there will be chaos and warlords will spring up, that armies need food and it has to come from somewhere, and so on. Also, he follows through with his magic--I'm not nearly as excited to see an original magic system as I am a book that's internally consistent with it.<br /><br />Then there's the bad. The biggest problem I noticed while reading was the writing style, which is amateurish. The action scenes were sometimes hard to follow (Vin tends to spend several pages fighting multiple opponents one or two at a time, with me wondering what the rest of the enemies are doing during all this), and the antagonists didn't feel quite sinister as they should have. And while I initially didn't agree with the reviewers who complain about the lack of sex (I have nothing wrong with authors choosing the fade-to-black method), Sanderson does have a problem with sexual tension--it's hard to believe Vin and Elend are in a relationship, rather than just friends.<br /><br />Overall, a decent second book that leaves you wanting the third immediately. What it lacks in literary merit, it makes up by being just plain enjoyable.black method), Sanderson does have a problem with sexual tension--it's hard to believe Vin and Elend are in a relationship, rather than just friends.

0385340575|4.0|Before commenting on Gone Tomorrow, I want to say that I didn't read Nothing to Lose because of the reviews it got here, and I appreciate what others think about new titles regarding because I hate wasting time reader crappy books...that being said,Lee Child scored HUGE with me on this one!!  I did not want the story to end. I love Manhattan and just trying to figure the lay of the land was fun, beside the action Reacher was into.  The story was intruiging to say the least and the characters assembly was interesting to picture as well......GREAT READ for Reacher fans!
B00005QGAZ|5.0|Michael Jackson was an amazing artist.  Granted he did kinda go freakoid after a while, but I'm not going to go over that.  His legendary album Thriller is simply awesome.  I'm a big fan of 80s pop, so I especially like songs like Thriller or PYT.<br /><br />However, I am not a big fan of the special edition of this album.  The original album had nine songs.  This has all of those classics, but you get much more than that.  A little too much more than that.  The special edition comes with a bunch of interviews with producers and writers and whatnot.  I'm not all that into those, though you might find it interesting.  It also comes with one or two unreleased songs and a different take on Billy Jean.  My favorite non-song on this CD is a practice session of the \\"rap\\" Vincent Price says in Thriller, which contains the entire poem (they cut out a verse for the final version of the song).<br /><br />Overall I urge you to by Thriller, but don't get the special edition if you can help it.  All the interviews kinda suffocate the songs.
B001PPGAK8|4.0|A new \\"cure\\" has been discovered by scientists and one very special mutant boy with powers to take mutant powers away, Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) is shocked about the announcement of this new cure for mutations as he wants a peaceful sollutions to the cure.

Magneto decides to declair war against humans while some mutants do like the idea of a cure especially troubled Rogue (Anna Paquin) who wants to be cured of her dangerous powers. It's up to the X-Men like Storm (Halle Berry), Wolverine (Huge Jackman), and new member Beast (Kelsey Grammer) to stop this war before humanity is doomed including mutant-kind.<br /><br />A very weak finale to the major Marvel based movie trilogy! it's quite complex but does have an interesting concept about curing people who are different then any normal human being, replacing Bryan Singer with Brett Ratner is kind of a dumb move. The film unlike the first two are rushed but does introduce some more mutants like Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones), Angel (Ben Foster) and Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) but the problem is that the story is prepostorous and the humor goes way too far unlike in the first two. The film does kill off some members of the X-Men but i ain't gonna tell you who for the film isn't as bad as fans proclaimed, it deserves another look since it's a very exciting finale of the series.<br /><br />This 2-Disc Blu-Ray gives off stunning picture and sound quality high theater-esque that will rocket your system on high with some fantastic extras like audio commentaries, Trailers, deleted scenes, Featurettes, a documentary on the trilogy, Still and video galleries, Vignettes and Blogs, and animatics.o galleries, Vignettes and Blogs, and animatics.
1416972242|5.0|As the second installment of the Mortal Instruments trilogy, the Shadowhunters have to deal with the fact that Valentine, a charismatic, brilliant man bent on their destruction, is alive and well, and not dead as they once supposed.  Some shadowhunters believe that Valentine's son, Jace, may have conspired to spy for Valentine and help him all along.  Clary, the heroine, is caught in the middle of her love for Jace (who, according to Valentine, is her brother), trying to find a way to wake up her comatose mother, trying to find it in her heart to love her long time friend, Simon, the way she loves Jace (who she thinks she should not love, because he is supposed to be her brother), and trying to stop her father, the cruel and merciless Valentine, from summoning a hoard of demons to kill everyone in the Clave, or those belonging to the shadowhunter world.  And as if these concerns were not enough, Clary also starts having strange dreams and begins to realize that she has certain powers that not everyone in the clave have, a fact that could make her an asset and a target.<br /><br />Fairies have a larger role in this novel than the last one, and vampires and werewolves are still on the scene, as in the first book.  Simon, Clary's best friend, also becomes a part of the shadow world, so he is no longer an outsider looking in on Clary's new life as a shadowhunter, and has a prominent role.<br /><br />Many parents/teens are concerned about the appearance of sex/drugs in books, so I will mention that this book is clean of both.  There are no drugs, sex may be referenced once or twice, but there are no sex scenes.  There is, however, one amazing kiss in the fairy court that changes a couple of lives, as well as some other kissing and moments of romance that are short-lived but sultry.  This book is more about love than lust.<br /><br />I loved the scene where Valentine was about to kill Simon and Simon could not pray, so he said the only word he could think worth saying, which was absolutely heart-wrenching... I loved the scene where Clary brought Valentines entire enterprise crashing down...I loved how we get to see Magnus start to connect with Alec.  I know I should not put too many details about the book in the review, but I just had include those three things.  There are probably about a dozen more I could include.  I really love this series, even though you still think Jace and Clary are related throughout this entire book (but you may doubt it) and they are very obviously in love.-wrenching...

0316044695|3.0|Lone Survivor is not the best book I've read on modern warfare, especially in regards to the concepts of limited war or even specialized war.  In these two categories, I consider the best books to be:  (1) [[ASIN:0871137380 Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War]], a great study in the complexities associated with limited war; and (2) [[ASIN:0552153575 Bravo Two-zero]], a gripping retelling of a SAS mission gone wrong.      Of course, why would I expect the book to dig into these two subjects?  The book touts itself as a harrowing tale of survival, and on this promise it delivers.  At nearly 400 pages, though, I expected the book to dig a bit deeper into at least one of these two subjects where special operations plays a central role.  On this expectation, Lone Survivor underdelivers.       Even so, Lone Survivor is still illuminating for two reasons.  First, the book makes plain what great Americans we have placed in harm's way.  The camaraderie of the teams, their commitment to America, and their sheer toughness should give anyone pause when considering who our heroes should be.  Second, the book provides an intimate account of the difficult landscape we've been traversing in Afghanistan.  The Taliban are battle tested, relentless, and very close with the local tribesmen.  In a country without modern roads, communications, or even an established government, such close alliances are difficult to disrupt.  Lone Survivor, though, shows, although indirectly, that such disruption is possible.        As our efforts to win the hearts and minds of the Afghanis progress, Lone Survivor suggests why our strategy may be promising, puts us next to the heroes putting it into action, and foreshadows the potential perils ahead.  Though not the best, it puts our current dilemma into context, which makes Lone Survivor worthwhile.

0061474355|5.0|I was enthralled in middle school and I've read it several times since then, and I'm 25 yrs. old now.  I still love it.  I am so charmed by the characters in Sabriel.  This is a good series to get into, and I think that this is the best book in the series simply because Sabriel as a heroine is preferable to the one in the subsequent books (Lirael is whiney and angst-ridden for too much of the other books).  I always read the bad reviews before I type my own review about books that I like, and I think that the people who thought the book was unclear and that the characters weren't likable must not have been in the mood for this type of story or something.  The story unfolds vividly for me and I am able to picture the entire story in my mind (and have done so).
1607060825|4.0|Frank Cho, to put it simply, is probably among the top five comic book illustrators working today, and his latest volume of art, \\"Apes and Babes: The Art of Frank Cho Book 1\\" shows this. Cho is not only a superb penciller, but as an inking draftsman, he can achieve amazing subtlety with pen and brush.    In this book you will find a selection of Cho's cover work, mostly (largely Marvel and work for independents), covering superheroes, jungle scenes, fantasy, science-fantasy, and other genres. Much of the book is composed of \\"before-and-after\\" pictures - on one page we see the preliminary sketch, on the other we see the finished inked/colored product. This is one reason that I only gave this book four stars - it would have been nice to fit some more variety into this book in that regard. Additionally included are some of Cho's own efforts in painting, which are quite good.    Overall this book is recommended for those with a serious interest in comic book art, or the work of Cho specifically.
0307588335|1.0|The fall of Lehman, including the hubris and mismanagement of Dick Fuld and Joe Gregory, is an important story to be told.  However, this book is a colossally painful read.  I would wait until future books by journalists come out.    This book is simply a vehicle for McDonald's own ego and hubris, which is ironic given the subject matter.  He claims that he is an insider, but he was one of thousands of vice presidents.  And yet he deceptively tries to paint the picture that he, Michael Gelband, Alex Kirk, and Larry McCarthy were all at the same table.  This, along with lines like \\"I was the only one who realized...\\" go to his overall credibility and makes me just roll my eyes.      Everything is black and white to McDonald, but there is much more nuance to this story and that's what I want to read.  And the melodrama throughout the book is beyond annoying -- starting with the line \\"It was probably the worst triple since St. Peter denied Christ.\\"  Seriously?  And it's like that all the way through the book.      Long story short, the only reason why this book will make any money is because it's the first book out.  But it's worth the wait to get the story from an author whose goal is not simply self-promotion and my take-away from this book is that McDonald wrote it more to stroke his ego than anything else.      There will be plenty of books that take the necessary and critical look at Fuld and Gregory's actions, so save your time and money and skip this one.
0061122416|4.0|This story of a young man and his pursuit of personal fulfillment and self awareness. It is an enjoyable story centered on the theme of the relationship we each have with ourselves, and as a result, the world. You will enjoy. It is a very quick read and colorful writing.
B000FIMG68|5.0|Lost avoided the sophomore slump in a major way in its second season by felxing its creative muscles.  The second season finds the show's creators increasing the moral complexity of the characthers, expanding their artistic ambitions and deepening the mysteries swirling about the island.  First and foremost is the hatch.  The second season wastes little time revealing the contents of the mysterious underground bunker which in turn leads to more questions.  We learn that the hatch is occupied by a man named Desmond who has been diligently entering numbers (the cryptic numbers from Season 1) into a computer and pusing a button every 108 minutes.  Why?  Desmond believes that he is saving the world.  From what?  Don't expect answers to that question anytime soon, at least not complete answers.  Remember, Lost is devoted to one long story arc.  The show does not follow the structure of most other shows and deal with short story arcs that provide quick answers and closure.  The majority of season 2 centers around the hatch, both physically (a good deal of action takes place there) and in terms of the plot.  But Season 2 brings a lot of other factors into the nix as well.  We learn even more about the complex backstories of the characters, which often interweave with one another tying in to the show's constant exploration of the theme of fate.  A new group of survivors are discovered on the other side of the island who crashed with the tail section of the plane.  Among them are Rose's husband, Anna Lucia who had an encounter with Jack in Season 1, and Mr. Echo who seems to serve as a counterpoint to Locke.  Speaking of Locke, he undergoes a crisis of faith which some fans may find maddening, but it's quite fitting for a character who ultimately doesn't know what he is supposed to be doing with his life or who he truly is.  Oh, and then there are the others.  Alluded to in Season 1, we finally get to meet them including their leader Ben, who disguises himself as Henry Gale, a stranded hot air baloonist who ifiltrates the ranks of the survivors.  All of this leads to more questions than answers of course.  Who are the others?  What is their purpose?  Why are they interested in Claire's baby?  Why did they take Walt?  We are also left to wonder if Desmond's button pushing in the Hatch has some purpose or if it's all part of a psychological experiment.  Season 2 is definitely one that will test the patience of casual fans.  Devoted fans, however, will find this season to be a deeply satisfying viewing experience full of action, drama, mystery and purpose.  It may not always seem like it, but the show's creators have mapped out where this show is heading and Season 2 is a major piece of the puzzle that will ultimately fall into place.a stranded hot air baloonist who ifiltrates the ranks of the survivors.

B001RE9HF2|5.0|This is by far the most perfect opera production of the several hundred (stopped counting after 400) we have seen.  We own the dvd version and compared it directly after getting the Blu-ray version--a splurge made because of the extraordinary quality of every performer and the staging on the dvd.   Since the dvd had superb engineering, we wondered if it could be better. Yes is is!  The picture is clearer, more detail can be seen in the dark background , and the sound is even better. Stunning!
1439157383|4.0|I got this book so I could read it before seeing the movie. I still haven't seen the movie since I'm waiting for it to come out on dvd, but the book was great. The whole scenario gets you thinking about how you would handle the situation if you were in each of the characters' shoes. It was also definitely a tear-jerker. A few negative comments, the book seemed to repeat itself. It felt like there were some points the author kept repeating just to get herself across. Also, I'm not sure the movie is going to be as good now that I know how it ends...

How I'd wished the book had been longer. Fearfully watching the damn book reach the halfway point, trying to hoard the pages, slow it down, just a little to hold me over... then, afterburners. Page after page, zooming, like a 356 pinning the tach. Finishing, looking at other novels stalker-like, \\"They aren't HER.\\" Each a promise of disappointment. There's nothing like this stuff. How lucky we got one more out of the guy.<br /><br />They're never long enough.<br /><br />Certainly not long enough for a \\"Goodbye.\\"
B0000AQZYM|5.0|The trailer for the Disney/Pixar film Finding Nemo showed only two Seagulls floating on the crust of the ocean. A bubble pops up from below the sea making it appear as though one of the Seagulls passed gas. One Seagull looks at the other and says \\"nice.\\" (We don't find out until we actually watch the movie that the bubble which surfaced was created by a massive explosion caused by Marlin and Dory attempting to escape from Bruce, the shark that views fish as \\"friends not food\\" but is sometimes overwhelmed by temptation...)    Based on the preview I had no way of knowing that I was sitting down to watch what would become known as quite possibly the best Disney animated feature of the DECADE. This film is so good that it can be watched again and again and again and never get old.    The film has become so popular that there is now a ride at Disneyland which allows Nemo fans to embark on an undersea adventure with Marlin, Nemo, Dory, Crush, Bruce, and even the Seagulls that yelp \\"Mine, mine mine\\"! [...]. There is a section on the Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage in this book: [[ASIN:0470285664 The Unofficial Guide to Disneyland 2009 (Unofficial Guides)]]    Overall I would definitely have to say this movie gets five stars and is, in my opinion, far and above every film Disney has released since. Other Disney animated features such as CARS and Wall-E are certainly close behind, but none can top Nemo.    In conclusion, my original expectations for this film were that I would simply be able to find Nemo throughout the course of the film, but I actually \\"found\\" a lot more. I found the most thrilling Disney film since Fantasia!
B0025X4P56|4.0|It's hard to top the masterpiece that is \\"Blinking Lights\\" yet I'm pretty sure every Eels fan out there was expecting E to do just that.  This is where some disappointment for Hombre Lobo comes from.<br /><br />On first listen I was immediately disappointed...where were the crazy, catchy, awesome songs that accompany every Eels album?  Not that the songs were bad, mind you, but I didn't think they were any where near the same level of greatness as his previous material.  I put the album away and was in disbelief that E could've made such an ordinary album.<br /><br />I picked it back up about a week later and couldn't believe how badly I had misjudged this album.  This was pretty amazing stuff.  It's as different from Blinking Lights as Souljacker is from Shootenanny... and therein lies the rub.  I  was judging Lobo based on his previous albums and that wasn't fair to the album itself.<br /><br />Hombre Lobo is full of great tunes.  The first half of the album alternates between loud fuzzy rock songs, reminscent of \\"Dog Faced Boy\\", and bittersweet, softer songs not unlike a lot of the material from Blinking Lights.  These constantly alternating styles takes you in and out of his wolf persona.<br />My favorite song on this album, easily, is Beginner's Luck.  A relatively short song with a killer scream-sing chorus line.<br /><br />I really love this album and if at first you don't like it, try listening to it without thinking about his other albums.<br /><br />Key Track:  Beginner's Luck
B000001GPX|5.0|It is an unusual experience listening to this recording. This was my first time listening to the 5th as I am new to the classical music. I got this version of the 5th because of a simple recommendation by a website. Since then I have been trawling through other recordings to see if they sounded different and I was suprised at how much interpretation of a particular piece of music makes all the difference. Well duh anybody on this site could have told me that. However what startled me the most is the way this version 'coloured' the experience of listening to the other versions, particularly the opening movement. They often sounded sluggish or muddled. I found myself waiting for something to correct some of my previous assumptions that were all based listening to this version and it just didn't happen. Most of the people that have listened to a variety of versions of this are able to keep relatively objective, but I can't. It's like I said in the title, a Masterpiece.    P.S If you are looking for a version of this and thinking of starting to listen to classical music as a hobby then try out Karajan's version first. Maybe it will colour the way you view this version! I believe that Karajan's 5 is clearly very good, but for me it pales in significance to this. I was listening to this on my kit at home and even took it to work. my workmates cant believe that I have this in my stacker between Faith no more and cat power. They say I clearly don't know who I am anymore........ maybe they are right?
B002436WFI|4.0|I dig Terry Pratchett very much; I think the dude's brilliant. But, truth is, the first two Discworld novels aren't anywhere near to being my favorites. It wasn't until the fourth and fifth entries ([[ASIN:0061020680 Mort]] and [[ASIN:0061020672 Sourcery]]) that I really started getting into the series. Maybe it's because I never was too fond of Twoflower, whose obliviousness was so pronounced that as a main character he simply lacked depth and believability; and this then made me not invest so much into the story. In later books, Pratchett would continue to hone his satirical thrusts, but he would also make you deeply care about the characters. So, no, Twoflower didn't do much for me. On the other hand, his murderous multi-legged Luggage became instantly all sorts of awesome. Carved out of rare sapient pearwood, the Luggage exuded chunks of personality, never mind that its preferred expression is... wooden.<br /><br />This two-part tele-film adaptation actually combines the novels THE COLOUR OF MAGIC and its direct sequel THE LIGHT FANTASTIC. I'm trying strenuously to be objective in rating this movie, but it's hard going. Terry Pratchett ranks as one of my all-time favorite writers, and, as a serious fan of Discworld, a live action adaptation still counts as monumental news to me. THE COLOR OF MAGIC is more accessible than (if not as good as) [[ASIN:B0010X741Y Hogfather]]. With THE COLOR OF MAGIC you don't have to be as in the know and the spoofing is more obvious. It's a must-see for Discworld addicts, especially since these adapted two novels form the launching points of the series. But will the rest of the viewing audience like it? Probably. Hopefully. Or it could be my Discworld myopia talking.<br /><br />On the shell of the enigmatic world turtle Great A'Tuin stand four colossal elephants, and on their backs lies the Discworld, an improbable place where \\"hubwards\\" and \\"rimwards\\" happen to be legitimate navigational directions. Focus in on the bustling city of Ankh-Morpork and narrow your gaze at the magical Unseen University, home of mighty wizards and Rincewind.<br /><br />There are eight levels of Wizardry. In his forty years spent in the Unseen University, Rincewind - Discworld's most hapless and cowardly wizard (but he spells it \\"wizzard\\") - has yet to achieve even one level. At last Rincewind finds himself expelled for sheer incompetence, and off he goes. He promptly lands a gig as guide to the amiable Twoflower, Discworld's very first tourist.<br /><br />Back in the Unseen University, skullduggery. It seems the speediest way to advance in the wizardly profession is thru assassination of one's immediate superior and the assumption of certain articles of his wardrobe. Thus, sporting new pointy shoes and hat signals sudden career upward mobility. One of the wizards, Trymon, is played to wicked smarmy perfection by Tim Curry and, glimpsing him, it quickly dawns on the viewer that someone or possibly several someones simply won't make it thru the film breathing. Even more dire, the Octavo - the greatest spellbook of all - is getting antsy and rattling its chains (yes, it's chained up!). One of its Eight Great Spells has gone missing and the absence is causing great turmoil at the University. Trymon, though, sees it as an opportunity.<br /><br />But, mostly, the film chronicles the misadventures of Rincewind and Twoflower. Twoflower insists on seeing all the sights, which causes no end of concern for Rincewind who, as mentioned, is a champion coward. If there were a course for Running Away... well, there isn't, but he would've done really well in class. There's a rambling feel, an episodic sense, to the first part of the film as Rincewind and Twoflower just seem to trudge along, one crazy predicament after another. That they keep on surviving is due some to fortunate bumbling and also to that one spell skulking in Rincewind's memory. Yes, Rincewind possesses one spell. But he doesn't really know what it does.<br /><br />There's also a subplot involving a scientific expedition which sets out to learn the Great A'Tuin's gender, the knowing of which is vital for some unexpressed but probably very important reason. As one astrozoologist asks: \\"So we're gonna look at the turtle's bottom?\\"<br /><br />And is that the Great A'Tuin inscrutably wending its way closer and closer towards a fiery red star? The people start to panic, as the star looms larger and larger. The Discworld needs a hero. Rincewind would please like to run away and fetch one. The story tightens up in the second part of the film, as Rincewind and Twoflower get caught up in a world-saving quest. So it's probably for the best that they run into Discworld's greatest warrior Cohen the Barbarian. Cohen has been in the hero business for eight decades, so it shouldn't be a surprise that the gent is now a geriatric. But he's still savvy. But savvy and toothless.<br /><br />THE COLOR OF MAGIC has its share of parodies, satiric barbs, and all-around silliness, and mostly they're not so subtle. There's an overenthusiastic enchanted sword which bullies Rincewind into heroic acts (this is NOT appreciated by Rincewind). There's some gouge-me-in-the-eye-it's-so-awful wordplay regarding insurance policies, and the silly difference between the circumference and the circumfence (they both run around the edges of Discworld).<br /><br />No problems at all with the acting. I don't know David Jason from Jason David, but he's pretty decent as Rincewind, although my sense was that the Rincewind in the novels was more robust. Sean Astin plays Twoflower, and he does a small wonder by making me like Discworld's first ever tourist. Tim Curry smiles and scowls, and both expressions are oily and pregnant with stab-you-in-the-back innuendos. One of my favorite characters in the Discworld series is Death, and he drops in for several humorous visits, usually timed whenever Rincewind is in mortal peril. And it's sweeeet that Christopher Lee provides Death's sepulchral voice. The best cameo, though, falls to Jeremy Irons. He shows up for half a mo as Lord Vetinari, the Patrician of Ankh-Morpork. The austere and despotic (but in a good way) Patrician is another of my favorites, and Irons truly does him justice. Also, author Terry Pratchett briefly moonlights as an astrozoologist, and it's absolutely fitting that he gets in the last word. Oh, and Brian Cox is quite good as the film narrator.<br /><br />THE COLOR OF MAGIC doesn't have the scope of a big budget production, and yet the special effects are quite forgiveable and very much on par with what I expect from tele-films. It helps that the tone of the film is so very much nudge in the ribs. THE COLOR OF MAGIC, originally broadcasted in the U.K. in 2008, is presented in widescreen format on DVD. It runs at 197 minutes, so pack a lunch. In the Absolutely-No-Bonus-Features Department, the DVD comes with absolutely no bonus features.<br /><br />The movie stays fairly true to the source material, but there are key omissions. If you've recently read THE LIGHT FANTASTIC, it'll hit you that the creepy things from the Dungeon Dimensions which, in the book, managed to burst thru into Discworld's reality, well, they don't do that in the movie. They don't even show up. We also miss out on a cameo from Ysabell, Death's adopted daughter (and future mother of the fabulous Susan Sto Helit). But, at least, we're treated to the Librarian, in both his pre-simian and then simian forms.<br /><br />I'm stoked that the next Discworld project is bringing [[ASIN:0552154326 Going Postal (Discworld)]] to the cinema, and I can't wait to see how con artist Moist von Lipwig is rendered onscreen. But I'm really waiting on Death (a.k.a. Bill Door) or Commander Vimes & the City Watch to be featured as the central characters in future flicks. Sweet Oogly Moogly, may it be so!

0307472590|5.0|\\"La Sombra Del Viento\\" has to be one of the best modern novels I have read in the last five years.   I have recommended it and bought it as a present to friends who are avid readers and have heard nothing but praise from them as well.
0385342020|5.0|I loved this book.  The story is about a present day girl in her twenties (Lara) whose great aunt recently passes away at the ripe old age of 105.  Lara never knew her great aunt Sadie (she was pretty much put in a nursing home and forgotten about).   At the thrown together funeral Lara starts seeing her great aunt Sadie (in the so-called flesh), but not as 105, but as a young woman in her early 20's (from back in the 1920's).  It seems Sadie has lost her precious necklace and cannot \\"rest\\" until she finds it.   Since Lara can see her and talk to her, she gets Lara to help her find it.       The banter between Lara and Sadie will have tears running down your face.  They are hilarious together.  Throughout the book Lara learns about Sadie's exciting life, as well as other family members (some good, some not so good).  There is also a love story (past and present) for both characters.         Sophie Kinsella just has a way of writing a book that will make you laugh out loud, cry and at the end sigh - all from the same book. I definitely recommend this one for anyone who enjoys contemporary chick lit.
B001JFZ118|1.0|I fall into the ranks of those bitten by a nostalgia bug.  I first saw this film right after college and remember loving it. I suspect that had more to do with the group of friends with whom I saw the movie than the movie itself. At least I hope that is the case.  The acting is horrific and the film just doesn't hold together.  Too bad they didn't hire a choreographer for the fight scenes. Pathetic.  My teenager says he now has confirmation that I have zero taste in action films.    As far as the DVD itself goes, it was noisy in the machine.  The sound was at times too low to be heard, and at other times too loud for comfort. The picture was grainy and often much too dark.  At least running the volume control up and down gave us something to do while watching it.    After the credits ran, we threw it out. I don't recall doing that with any other DVD I have purchased. I suppose I could have donated it to the library, but why inflict this on anyone else?
B00009ZYBY|3.0|This movie is a great action movie of the toga-sandal genre, it is NOT a historical movie, though it is set in Ancient Rome.The true history of Commodus is much more exciting, imaginative and colorful than the trite story line we are given in this film.  Here are the most important facts on which the movie differs from history:  1-Commodus was never disowned by his father, on the contrary from a very young age Marcus Aurelius wanted him to be his heir and gave him all the necessary titles and honors to go along with the job. All evidence points to exactly the opposite, he loved his son too much rather than too little. It is hard to believe such an intelligent man picked such a poor successor since at 19, which was his age at his father's death,  (and roughly our equivalent of 30) Commodus must have demonstrated his character faults plenty of times. He was co-ruler with his father from 176 onwards and his father died in 180. He did not have to kill him to become the ruler as he already was.  2-Commodus had a sister Lucilla, ( he also had several others, none of which appear in the film) who had been married to Lucius Verus, co-ruler with his father, when he started his reign, and therefore had the title since then of 'Augusta'. She conspired against him in 182, according to the sources the cause was friction with the Empress Crispina, Commodus' wife. This was just two years after he became sole emperor, with two of her lovers, Marcus Ummidius Quadratus (the consul of 167, who was also her first cousin) and Appius Claudius Quintianus, both were executed, she was exiled to Capri and then conveniently murdered. She was married at the time but her husband was not implicated in the conspiracy.This is a much better script than the movie's and I can not comprehend why it was not used instead of the convoluted absurd scenario that was concocted.  Furthermore this Lucilla looks like she just graduated from Vassar. When will American audiences comprehend that the Romans were overwhelmely dark-haired and that only the Barbarians at that time were fair?? Such a persistent racist perspective, which is present since the beginning of Hollywood by British actors playing the roles of Romans, is really incomprehensible today, particularly in the case of Lucilla's child that looks ready for kindergarten in Switzerland or the senators we see, all of which could be having a drink at the Harvard Club and none of which could have possibly been a Roman aristocrat.  3-Commodus did fight both animals and gladiators in public, however he did not die in the arena, but was strangled by his professional trainer, the wrestler Narcissus, who conspired with Commodus mistress, Marcia to get into his bedroom and strangle him after Marcia had made Commodus drunk. There are discrepancies in the sources as to whether it happened in the bathroom or the bed, either one of which would have been better than the silly circus fight that we knew before he started it he was going to 'lose'.  4-Maximus as a character did not exist at that period, it is a complete fabrication with a little bit of Spartacus, Richard Burton's Anthony and a lot of Steve Reeve's Hercules thrown in a blender.  5-The emperor Commodus was heavily muscled and bearded and considered a model of male beauty at that time. Numerous statues show him in Hercules' regalia.  Joaquin Phoenix is terribly miscast in the role, he looks like a Roman bureaucrat, at best, and at worst like just a jackass. His costumes are particularly wrong, much more suited for the Opera stage of Venice during the 18th Century. His makeup would have been great in a silent film and is strangely out of place here, verging on the comical.  6-The depiction of the gladiators, like all American productions relating to this period of history completely and purposefully distorts the facts of their daily life and exercise by censoring, hiding and refusing to allocate nudity and the strong presence of sexuality, both heterosexual and homoerotic that was part of that world. When will we see that our present day ideas on the topic had NOTHING to do with the way these people lived?? What we see here is a varsity team that can kill in the field, not the super stars of the Roman arena that had huge fame and wealth along with all the perks that came with their violent, brutal profession.  All of the above taken into consideration, the movie is an entertaining, fast-action fantasy that has escapist value. Russell Crowe never looked better and he does do an extremely convincing characterization of a provincial, country-loving, old fashioned virtuous and somewhat brutish Roman general of the type the Romans themselves always liked to praise with great respect.
B001PPLIEG|4.0|the dialogue. Its too fast and quiet. It made me hate the movie the first time I saw it, because I could not catch what the actors were saying and my hearing is perfect. Then I watched it again, with captions and it all made perfect sense. You have to follow it closely or get lost. One of the better Bond films, was'nt boring like Casino Royale. This reboot series really emphasizes just how angry Bond is, and how violent he is. I remember myself saying, Jesus 007 is vicious. I never said that for any of the other hundred Bond movies. Great action scenes good acting, Daniel Craig and the writers really show the coldness, and just the pure unadulterated efficiency 007 has for killing. The only part I hated was the airplane scene where they fell from like 15,000 feet and landed safely even though they opened the parachute like two seconds before they landed. And the fact that Jack White and Alicia Keys pretty much made the worst Bond song ever. But just ignore those parts. Hell the bad guy even had a perfect scheme this time. I say buy it.

0380725398|4.0|I picked up this book after reading the author's bestselling book, Rebecca. I expected something similar. I didn't read many reviews before reading it. I never do because I feel some people reveal too much information. Amazon's synopsis is pretty vague. A girl goes to live with an aunt at a remote Inn with a mysterious reputation.     If I had known what what was behind the big mystery at Jamaica Inn, I'm not sure I would have purchased the novel.  With that said, after reading the book, I'm glad I read it. Jamaica Inn has convinced me that Daphne du Maurier can keep a reader spellbound regardless of the subject.    In Jamaica Inn, Mary Yellan promises her dying mother that she will go live with her Aunt Patience after mother's death. Mary is a strong and independent girl, but promises her mother that she will go to her Aunt, who she cheerfully remembers as amusing and full of life.    The woman Mary Yellan encounters is radically different from the girl Mary remembers. Patience lives with her husband Joss Merlyn at an old and remote Inn that people seem deadly afraid of.  Joss is a violent and alcoholic man who makes his wife tremble in his presence. Mary, however, makes a vow that she will not allow herself to be afraid of him.  Strange events at the Inn, however, make it impossible for Mary to remain brave. There are strange sounds and voices coming in and out of the Inn during the wee hours of the morning. Mary's Aunt Patience, pleads with Mary to simply cover her head under her blanket and ignore anything she may hear. Mary's curiousity, however, gets the best of her.     When  Mary discovers the truth about the events that take place at Jamaica Inn, she knows that she must get herself and her aunt out of there immediately. There are only two people she can turn to, Francis Davey, a local vicar Mary befriends and Jem Merlyn, Joss Merlyn's younger brother. Although Jem bears a strong physical resemblance to Mary's terrifying uncle, she find herself strangely drawn to him. Jem's unpredictable and unruly behavior make it hard for Mary rely on him for protection.    Jamaica Inn is not quite up to par with Rebecca, but the suspense has Daphne du Maurier written all over it. I wasn't totally crazy about this book, but I still plan to read every novel written by this author. Any book written by Daphne du Maurier is a must read.
B00139WPVY|4.0|If contemporary album reviews are to be believed, \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\" burst like a thunderclap on to the music scene, helped, no doubt, both by the lurid album cover (and better inner sleeve artwork) created by Barry Godber, and by the explosive impact of the opening track, \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\". Commercially, KC were unable to capitalise on this debut because the band effectively broke up, going through several changes of line-up before reaching the Fripp-Wetton-Bruford-Cross version that for many, myself included, represented the high-point of the band's evolution.     Forty years on, does \\"In the Court\\" stand the test of time? On the whole, the album - especially in HQCD format - stands up pretty well. The genius of the album was - and remains - the blend of heavy rock and the more ethereal style of the late sixties. Others - notably the Moody Blues - had tried this kind of fusion, but no one did it as boldly or as effectively as KC.     The nuances between rock and etherea determine how the album can be enjoyed today, with the former lasting, predictably, better than the latter.     \\"Schizoid Man\\" is a raucous, uncomplicated rock number, and remains vibrant and exciting. \\"I Talk to the Wind\\" is much more \\"sixties\\" in its style, but remains a good track. The high-point of the album is, undoubtedly, \\"Epitaph\\", a complex and superbly textured piece which benefits considerably from Peter Sinfield's lyrics.     In my opinion - and, indeed, those of many contemporary reviewers - \\"Moonchild\\" is the weakest track on the album. To some of those reviewers, it was simply too long; seen from the perspective of 2009, the title alone (and the lyrics) are sufficient to peg the track into the flower era of the sixties.     The tour de force here - in addition to \\"Epitaph\\" - is the title track, a beautifully complex, structured piece which again benefits from Sinfield's lyrics.     \\"In the Court\\" was a spectacularly original album back in 1969, and - with the exception of \\"Moonchild\\" - has worn well. KC were not going to be this good again until the magisterial \\"Red\\" album in 1974. In both cases, the albums benefit from the Japanese HQCD format. Because of its subtle texturing, \\"In the Court\\" benefits particularly from this process. It's still a classic, and better than ever in this format.
B0028K3192|2.0|I was extremely disappointed with this.  I don't understand how anyone could give this 5 stars.  I love Maxwell to death and this album truly seems beneath his caliber.  It certainly has not made me excited about his next two albums he is releasing.  The only song I like so far is \\"Pretty Wings\\".  I will give it another listen and see if any of the other songs grow on me but I am glad this was gift for someone and I did not actually purchase this myself.  Come on Maxwell!
1573228737|4.0|I have just finished this novel and find that I am having mixed feelings about it.  There was a definite pull from this book which kept me reading throughout the day with no desire to put it down, but closer to the end I started having instincts about where the final pages would take me.  Sarah Waters has such a clever and unique writing style that captivates me; I have read all of her books with a fervor and have found that they meet my needs of both style and substance.  And this book did not disappoint in that respect.<br />  What I found to be disturbing was trying to use 2 different points of view from both Margaret and Selina, and it took me nearly halfway through the book to start comprehending Selina's.  Also, I did not feel that the ending completely answered questions that I had throughout; perhaps that is the intention of Waters:  she never tells anything, but rather dances around with subtlety so that the reader can use his own intelligence to predict and presume.  I do like that about her, but I have to agree with some other reviewers that there was just something missing in this one that I can't quite put my finger on.  One feeling I came away strongly with~ I would not have wanted to be in prison (gaol) during this time period.  Truly it was for punishment and punished they were.
B001U7FWM8|2.0|I have listened to this over and over hoping to be as captivated by even one song like I was with \\"Yellow House.\\"  It's just not happening.  I am very disappointed in this CD, the songs are mediocre at best.
B001GCUO1Q|3.0|I like the Wolverine character. He's one of the original anti-heroes and is revered worldwide as an all out badass of ridiculous proportion. Apart from in a recent series of comics, the origins of the Wolverine character have never really been discussed so a movie about those origins I can imagine was a bit of a surprise for fans when it was announced. The real question being, just how are they going to take on the origins of such a complex character in the Marvel universe? Let's be honest it wasn't going to be an easy task. This film acts not just as a prequel to the X-Men trilogy of films but also as a stand alone film to give the fans of the X-Men films an idea of the history of this character and just how exactly he came to be.<br /><br />Starting off in 1845 a young James Howlett witnesses the murder of his father by groundskeeper Thomas Logan. Shocked and angry, James' mutation (bone claws) is activated and he attacks and kills Logan. With his last breath Logan reveals that he is James' biological father. James flees the home with Logan's abused son Victor Creed and they both promise each other that they will always have each others back. Fast forward to when they are adults and they are approached by a young William Stryker who offers them a chance to join Team X. The brothers join but soon their questionable actions cause James to leave the group.<br /><br />6 years later, James is now known as Logan and is living with his girlfriend in Canada. He is approached by Stryker who warns him that someone is killing off each member of the original team. Victor is the one killing off the members and he is the one that kills Logan's girlfriend leading them into a brutal sibling rivalry. Stryker offers Logan a way of defeating Creed, joining the weapon X programme which will reinforce Logan's bones with the indestructible Adamantium. When Stryker attempts to wipe Logan's memory during the procedure Logan breaks free and vows to take revenge on Stryker and Victor. Logan needs to find Stryker's hidden laboratory known as \\"The Island\\" and he must enlist the help of the famous X-Man, Remy LeBeau (Gambit).<br /><br />The characters in the film are a very welcome additional fantasy and comic element to the X-Men movie universe. In the X films the characters, although maintaining the fantasy element, were a bit too serious for their own good. In this, in my opinion, they have taken on a more comic book element similar to the newest comic book movies such as Incredible Hulk and Iron Man. The characters don't take themselves too seriously which, in a film like this, is always a good thing. Hugh Jackman reprises his role as Wolverine and although I did enjoy him in the X-Men films, I found he struggled slightly to keep my interest in the character for the entirety of the film.  Liev Schreiber as Victor Creed (Sabretooth to the comic fans) was an inspired choice and I have to say a much preferred one to Tyler Mane who played the character in the X-Men movies. They both had a fantastic chemistry together during their fight scenes and general acting together. The brotherhood seems believable and it makes the film work when they are beating the hell out of each other.<br /><br />The other interesting characters that made this film work wonders are mainly the ones involved in Team X mainly displayed at the start of the film and, of course, the legendary Gambit. Ryan Reynolds made this film an enjoyable and light hearted piece of work as the character Wade Wilson or Deadpool to others. The funny one liners and general character demeanour made me wonder why Reynolds didn't have a larger part to play in the film as a whole. I can't help but think that the film would have been a bigger success in terms of critical ratings had he obtained a higher prominence in the film. Taylor Kitsch as Gambit achieves his goal of portraying the coolness of the character well, but doesn't match up to the brilliance of the comic interpretation. The young William Stryker played by Danny Huston isn't as intimidating as his X2 predecessor, Brian Cox, but does manage to play the manipulative role quite well.<br /><br />Some of the settings really don't work as well as you would think. A lot of the indoor sets look like the sets from what you would imagine to see in a cheap independent film. The special effects when used to their fullest extent work well but other times fell short (see the initial back alley fight between Logan & Gambit) and come across as if they were done at the last minute. The fight choreography between the two brothers is at times flawless and the best example of a great fighting scene is during the end of the movie which I wont reveal anything about as it's a must see.<br /><br />The film wasn't great. In fact the majority of the plot and dialogue was quite poor but my attention was brought back when the cool action would take place. Ryan Reynolds could have saved this film had his character been given a more prominent role throughout. The effects and settings work where they're supposed to but do fall flat at some points during the film. Jackman is a good choice as the Wolverine character, but he struggled slightly to hold the whole film as the character. We all learn from experience and where this film fell down may be repaired. A Sequel is apparently in the works and although we didn't see it in this instalment I do hope that we do, at some point, see Jackman put on the famous Blue & Yellow suit.sn't as intimidating as his X2 predecessor, Brian Cox, but does manage to play the manipulative role quite well.

B000CZ0Q5W|5.0|I highly respect and deeply enjoy Metheny's music, but some of his albums have included songs i didn't particularly appreciate.  This album contains pure enjoyment - every song.  There's no one like Metheny.  I bought this album on cassette when it first came out.  I've since bought it on CD and listen to it today with as much awe as when I first heard it.
B00004BZ16|5.0|Leave aside the silly lefty romanticism with the wretched Sandinistas, leave aside the reality that some of the songs really don't measure up, and remember instead the outrageous ambition (36 songs! 3 albums in vinyl!), the commitment, the rage against Thatcherism, and the ability -- on an amazing number of tracks -- to channel all that into music as vital nearly thirty years on as on the day the tracks were first laid down.    OK, maybe I got a little carried away there, but as I listen to Somebody Got Murdered on a hot NYC summer night, it wasn't much of a stretch.  Here's the evidence, aside from Somebody, Magnificent Seven, Hitsville U.K., Junco Partner, Ivan Meets G.I. Joe, Something About England, Crooked Beat, Corner Soul, Sound of the Sinners, Police on My Back, Charlie Don't Surf, and -- the one that knocks me out every time I hear it -- Lose This Skin.  So that's a dozen and I didn't even stop to think.    This is for all time.
B00006JKON|3.0|Warchild - (1974)  17 Tracks (7 bonus) (65:53) ***<br /><br />This is probably the least popular of the early Jethro Tull albums, and is reflected by the lowest rating by Amazon customers.  It does contain a couple of very well known hits like the excellent Skating Away on the Thin Ice of the New Day...and, Bungle in the Jungle.  But, the majority of the other songs are just too mediocre in my opinion. Obviously, being the follow-up to Thick as a Brick and the Passion Play, this album was something of a let-down.  The only other really decent song (again, in my opinion) is Back-Door Angel.<br />Something the remastered version offers is 7 bonus tracks, but these are quite a mixed bag.  Two of them are nothing more than orchestral arrangements with no lyrics.  Sorry, but that's just semi-interesting filler, while some of the others rival many of the original songs on the album.  Rainbow Blues is a stand-out favorite of mine and Glory Row and Saturation are both above average tracks.  If You do not have the song Rainbow Blues, you must buy this remaster for that song alone.
B001ECE6C6|4.0|Nice collaboration.  The polish language and Maria's voice meld very nicely with Metheny's style.  This album's rendition of Are You Going With Me is worth the price of the entire CD.  However, there are other songs on the album that are noteable.

On top of that, I won't actually own the kindle edition-- I can only rent it from Amazon and the publisher, who can decide to limit the number of times I download the book, delete it from my Kindle, prevent me from reading it on other devices, etc, etc, etc. I also doubt that Jeff Lindsay will see much profit from my purchase once Amazon and the publisher take their respective cuts. Instead of eliminating the dead-weight middleman (the publisher), Amazon has effectively created an additional middleman with the Kindle store.<br /><br />I own and love all three versions of the Kindle, but I wish that Amazon would stop exploiting customers with monopoly pricing and the undisclosed \\"features\\" of the Kindle.<br /><br />As for the actual story, I was excited to read it, but have decided to grab it from the library. Why on earth would I pay $2 more for a book that I can't lend to my friends, or that might one day disappear from my collection without warning?
B001FBSMW6|4.0|An anxiety common among many bands (especially in pop/rock music) is the fear of releasing a succession of albums that sound the same.  These bands are intent on revising, updating, or sometimes completely reinventing their sound with every album release.  This determination to keep their music sounding fresh is what often sets great bands apart from the rest.  Such modification, however, can be dangerous.  For these bands, the risk of alienating their old fans is always there.  Many fans may feel betrayed by the band's divergence from their earlier sound(s).  Bands willing to make musical transitions, though, are often the ones that leave the most memorable musical legacy, the Beatles being the most well-known example.     That being said, I first listened to Perfect Symmetry fully expecting a Keane sound distinct from their first two albums, Hopes and Fears, and Under The Iron Sea. Just as the first two albums are markedly different from each other, so too is Perfect Symmetry distinct from them.  Each album has a distinct mood:  Hopes and Fears seems to me to be their \\"Spring\\" album.  On the surface, the songs appear to be light pop, but closer listening reveals a darker sense of trying to remain stable in an unstable world.  Under The Iron Sea was their \\"Winter\\" album, containing songs with dark themes/undercurrents that reflected the hardships the band was going through at the time the album was recorded.  This mood was reflected in both the lyrics and music. Perfect Symmetry, I feel, is their \\"Summer\\" album; their most fun, vibrant CD.  Though it does contain downbeat lyrics, it pairs those serious messages with contrasting, upbeat music and rhythms, with 1980s-style synthesizer sounds scattered throughout.  The songs often offer commentary on the state of the world today, particularly in the title track and \\"Playing Along\\", both of which contain lyrics about coping with the painful realities of living in a world of violence and war.     After purchasing Perfect Symmetry, I found myself listening to it compulsively, even though after my first listen I deemed it to be inferior to both of Keane's previous CDs.  After three or four listens, however, I came to appreciate its sense of fun, and its powerful, emotional messages. I feel it is their most powerful album.  This CD is full of great hooks and melodies, which I feel is Tim Rice-Oxley's strong point as a songwriter.  It could take a few listens for one to gain a full appreciation of this CD's excellence.     In reading some other reviews written by people who purchased this CD (particularly reviews on another site) I noticed some criticism of singer Tom Chaplin's voice.  I could hear a bit of strain in Chaplin's vocals on a couple songs.  \\"Spiralling\\", the opening track, is the most evident example, but upon listening to the songs more, I feel Chaplin was just singing differently than we are accustomed to hearing him because the songs require it.  These songs have a kind of intensity not found on Hopes and Fears or Under The Iron Sea.  One of his most impressive vocal performances is on \\"Better Than This\\", a song a singer with an inferior voice could not handle.  I even hear shades of Freddy Mercury in his delivery on this song (specifically when he sings the \\"Get a grip on yourself\\" section towards the end).  The clarity, range, and power of his voice on this song are impressive indeed.  Other vocal highlights on Perfect Symmetry include the title track (apparently inspired by the terrorist attacks in London a few years ago, and which may be the best track on the album) and \\"You Don't See Me\\", one of only two ballads on the CD.  Chaplin's falsetto on the bridge of \\"You Don't See Me\\" is truly breathtaking.  He is undoubtedly one of the best singers in music today.  His passionate delivery is incredibly affecting and appealing, and it adds so much feeling to these already emotionally-charged songs, making them that much more powerful.     Keane are my favorite band and have never failed to impress me, even on this most drastic of departures from their \\"signature style\\".  The first half of Perfect Symmetry is quite bouncy and energetic, then the second half tones things down and features some songs with the more intimate messages and delivery their fans have grown accustomed to (e.g. the final song \\"Love Is The End\\", which is one of their very best).  Keane's willingness to expand their sound with such impressive results makes them all the more remarkable to me.  This is their most fun CD so far and my favorite to listen to.  Perfect Symmetry was easily one of the best albums of 2008 and a triumph for Keane, one of the most outstanding bands in music.  I can't wait to hear what they come up with next.
0440244870|2.0|I think this book is something like \\"13 Going on 30\\" meets \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\", but doesn't nearly live up to either of those.  It has some fun moments and while I can relate on some level to this character (my former self, 20 years ago)--for the most part the main character was extremely unsympathetic, stupid, and self-serving to the point that I almost couldn't finish the book.  I was fine, but turned a corner when she agreed to go on a date with her flatmate's cousin.  At that point, I was totally alienated.  This character is a combination of George Costanza from Sienfeld (only George isn't as selfish) and Homer Simpson (except that Homer is less of a fraud) wearing designer clothes.  How lucky this author is to have this made into a film--I am sure it will be very lucrative for her, which was likely her goal from the beginning since this book had no point whatsoever.

It reflects Human Nature in it's truest light, while showing off the acting talents of both Cruise and Kidman.  Edgy, eccentric and titallating.  One of Kidman's Best performances. From the sets to the costuming, to the lighting and performance, this AMAZING Motion Picture is well worth watching. Mature Audiences, Some Total Nudity and Adult Themes.  I give this great work of art and \\"A+\\".
0385342020|1.0|As a fan of Sophie Kinsella, I look forward to all her new releases. I loved all the Shopaholics and Undomestic Goddess. Remember Me was not one of my favorites, but still entertaining.    I had to force myself to finish this book, hoping it would get better. It did not. It rambled on and on. I am sorry, but the premise was pretty stupid to begin with. I must read the summaries more carefully in the future. This was a very long, tedious book. It did not have the wit and sparkle of other Kinsella books. Most Chick Lit do not have annoying ghosts and the scenes with her picking out vintage clothing were very tiresome.    Thumbs down from me.
B00005JLT5|5.0|This is a WONDERFUL Motion Picture from Director, Roman Polanski, dealing with the Holocaust and the Malevolent treatment of the Jews during WWII, starring Adrien Brody.  His performance carries you through his adversity on his shoulders, while never losing his love of Music.  Astonishing is putting it lightly.  Subsistence of life is what makes this great work so amazing.  A must watch.  I give this an \\"A\\".
B0014I4KH6|5.0|When I came back here and read my review, I realized I hadn't actually reviewed the music itself, simply explained why Taylor is an excellent artist and how she served as my bridge from ignorance into appreciation of the music industry. So I believe it would be fair to do a legitimate review of her songs (to which I am listening now).  Overall, Taylor Swift the album is stripped-down, acoustic and features almost entirely quiet vocals--a complete change from her recent pop-leaning smashes. I won't say either one is better, but I will admit that after a day of listening to sex-driven Korean pop, rowdy top 40 hits and a lot of Taylor's two more recent albums, going back to this quiet Taylor is somewhat refreshing.  TIM MCGRAW 5/5  This is a very sweet, laidback, quiet song that reminisces about a past summer relationship that has been presumably lost. This debut song opens with the gentle strumming of strings, before Taylor joins in vocally. The entire song is quiet and loaded with memory; it is meant to inspire thinking and recollection, not be throbbing, bass-laden junk called \\"music\\" that accompanies wild parties. A true beauty.  If you are into collecting Taylor's rare, unreleased songs as I used to be (I had to stop because my heavy course load prevented me from investing in more time to find others), you have probably listened to her two demos of Tim McGraw - the piano demo, titled When You Think Tim McGraw, and the simple acoustic demo. They make for very interesting comparisons and really show how the lyrics and instrumentation evolved to create her demo single. To collectors, I recommend listening to all three in chronological order so as to fully understand what went into making this song. :)  PICTURE TO BURN 4/5  This song is Better Than Revenge's granddaddy - the same emotions, anger and revenge, are featured here, but Taylor gives her age away by carefully avoiding saying rash things as she does much more easily in Better Than Revenge (i.e. \\"She's betterknown for the things that she does on the mattress\\"). The piece features louder guitars, a much louder Taylor and plenty of good riddance.  As is the case with Tim McGraw, there are several demos of Picture to Burn in the collections of the most dedicated Taylor fans. I only have one, which does make for a pretty cool comparison. Listen to the demos and then the song if you would like to hear the evolution of Picture to Burn.  TEARDROPS ON MY GUITAR 5/5  So countrified that it can be hard to realize this is the same girl who released Enchanted and Haunted, but that is absolutely not a bad thing. Although Taylor was only a freshman when she conceived this song, the theme of unrequited adoration (I'm a bit hesitant to call a freshman crush \\"love\\") is undoubtedly universal. Just listening to it is enough to feel the sadness Taylor experienced when Drew fell for another girl when they were such friends. A must-listen.  A PLACE IN THIS WORLD 5/5  The first piece on the album about something other than love. In this song's case, it is about a young girl (aka Taylor) trying to find her niche in a busy world that seems to have little time for her. The mood in this song ranges from realistic (\\"I'm alone, on my own and that's all I know\\") to optimistic (\\"Got the radio on, my old blue jeans/ Can you tell me what more do I need?\\"), a range much appreciated in an industry saturated with monotonal pop hits. This is a song that most undetermined college majors can relate to.  COLD AS YOU 5/5  Taylor sings about a former relationship with an emotionally empty boy who turned his knowledge and understanding of her into a tool that he used to gain the upper hand. \\"When you take, you take the very best of me.\\" Taylor vocally stretches herself a bit in the chorus, but throughout the song, vocal strain is at a minimum, which makes for a very pleasant listen.  THE OUTSIDE 5/5  Now isn't this a song so many people can understand? Though you wouldn't guess it by the success she enjoys now,Taylor evidently wasn't well-accepted when she was younger, and pours her feelings as an outcast into this song. If you cannot relate, either you are a psychopath or you WERE one of those nasty kids who were the reason others felt excluded. Shame on you!  Despite the lyrical sadness, the overall instrumentation is upbeat, with jovial guitars and Taylor's own voice singing in what would seem to be a cheery manner to one who does not understand English.  TIED TOGETHER WITH A SMILE 4/5  Although this song addresses bulimia, a very important topic, it loses a point for the repeated lines and instruments over and over and over again nearing the end. The rest of the song, however, has an appropriately somber/sympathetic feel, which seems to be what Taylor was aiming for.  STAY BEAUTIFUL 4/5  As in the case of Tied Together with a Smile, Stay Beautiful loses a point for repetition towards the end. However, the rest of the song is filled with notions of sunshine and brightness brought about by the yearning for an evidently attractive boy named Corey. Taylor's voice and instruments are bouncy, playful and very purely happy - and I can see why - even though she is not in a relationship with this boy. If Teardrops in My Guitar features all the tears of unrequited feelings, Stay Beautiful focuses on all the happiness.  SHOULD'VE SAID NO 5/5  Like Picture to Burn, but much more power-fueled, and in my opinion, contains a lot more substance. She was cheated on, and turned that fury into a song that hit the charts and became one of her singles from this album. This song features energetic guitars and some autotune, but a mostly natural voice. Love it!  MARY'S SONG (OH MY MY MY) 5/5  About Taylor's neighbors' relationship, which is super sweet! It has a very country yet modern feel, and makes you incapable of doing anything but hoping you might someday reach the level of happiness that these neighbors did with each other. Perfectly sweet, perfectly beautiful - if I believed in giving more than 100% ratings to songs, I would, to this one.  OUR SONG 5/5  Happiest song on the record, and the best way to end. It's about Taylor's happiness and satisfaction in a relationship, except for one pesky thing: she and her boyfriend don't have a song that defines them, so he assures her that their song only needs to consist of the sounds that already fill their relationship.  My original review:  This is truly a wonderful work of art for Taylor Swift - and the fact that it is her debut album makes it even more noteworthy. Before this self-titled CD had I'm Only Me When I'm With You, Invisible, Perfectly Good Heart and the pop version of Teardrops on My Guitar added to it, it had eleven tracks and slightly different lyrics in Picture to Burn and Teardrops on My Guitar. From that original CD, five of the eleven songs were released as singles. That shows this artist has talent!  When I first heard of Taylor Swift - about a year ago - I was a 13-year-old, a fresh teenager, who barely knew of any music. If you'd asked me who T.I. or Madonna was, I would not have known. However, when I picked up an October 2008 Fashion Edition of Us Weekly, I saw Taylor Swift featured along with Hillary Duff and Lauren Conrad. I'll be honest with you: I thought Taylor Swift was your typical celebrity - blonde, spoiled and with way too much money to know what to do with. I didn't give her another thought until, in a later Us Weekly, I saw her in an interview; she talked about how she wrote and recorded Forever & Always shortly before the album's release, and how she's always been honest with her fans. My opinion of her didn't change, but seeing her twice in the same type of magazine didn't let me forget her quickly. Later on youtube I searched her, found her channel and watched her video for Love Story. It was the first Taylor Swift song - first country song, for that matter - I've ever listened to. And I was intrigued and amazed by the pure beauty of the video, as well as her incredible talent. Needless to say, I became a huge Taylor Swift fan. The story doesn't end there; finding Taylor Swift made me explore the musical world more, and since then my iTunes library has grown to quite an impressive size. Thank you, Taylor Swift.  To Swift's critics, this album is pure country with the exception of the pop version of Teardrops on My Guitar. My favorite songs are all the singles released from it (Tim McGraw, Picture to Burn, Teardrops on My Guitar, Should've Said No, Our Song) - but I also adore all the others. From the later-added tracks I particularly adore I'm Only Me When I'm With You.  Unless you're into the completely opposite, like screamo and heavy metal, I definitely recommend buying this album. I am so glad I did.
B002436WFI|3.0|Ever since Carrot arrested him in Guards! Guards! I've been a fan of Lord Havelock Vetinari, the Patrician and thoughtful tyrant of Ankh-Morpork in Terry Pratchett's Discworld series.  That was the third Discworld novel I read and my first extended look at the Patrician and I immediately saw him in my mind's eye as looking and sounding exactly like Jeremy Irons.  Since then I've been convinced that Irons would be the perfect choice to play Vetinari in a movie or TV adaptation.  So I was happy when I read that he had been cast in the TV miniseries, The Color of Magic.<br /><br />One of the disappointing things about the show, though, is that while I see Jeremy Irons as the perfect Patrician, Jeremy Irons apparently doesn't see Jeremy Irons as the perfect Patrician.<br /><br />Irons sees the Patrician as someone slightly more foppish and fussy than himself, as somebody's strict piano teacher or a museum curator who's favorite expression is \\"Don't touch\\" given unlimited power to punish their pet peeves.  His Patrician doesn't sound like Jeremy Irons either.  He speaks with a lisp and replaces his R's at the beginnings of words with W's, which makes me wonder if we've been wrong about the name of his beloved dog all along and the mangy mutt's name is actually Ruffles.<br /><br />Come to think of it, that might have been Irons' inspiration for the lisp.<br /><br />At any rate, in the Color of Magic Irons plays Vetinari as a Jeremy Irons character instead of as Jeremy Irons and I think this costs the character a lot of its humor, which is based on the many ways the Patrician finds to express his menace in a calm and almost friendly manner.  It's difficult to imagine this more cartoonish Patrician having mimes chained up upside down in dungeons.<br /><br />But Irons' choice on how to play his part isn't anywhere near as disappointing, or disconcerting, as the casting of David Jason as the inept and cowardly wizard Rincewind...<br /><br />This is an excerpt from the review I posted on my blog.  You can read the whole thing at[...]ng at[...]

B0026J8LHM|4.0|Black Clouds and Silver Linings, the newest album from Prog-Rock gods Dream Theater has everything you could want in a DT album. This album will certainly not disappoint fans of this incredible band. While only 6 tracks long, there is as much music packed into this album as any of DT's previous releases. I wouldn't call this new album groundbreaking. I don't think it will have a huge impact in expanding this band's fan base, but it will satisfy Dream Theater fans. It's everything you have come to expect and love about this magnificent band. If you are new to Dream Theater, this is as good a place as any to start. If you are a fan, you should already own this. Black Clouds and Silver Linings is yet another progressive masterpiece crafted by the guys that know how to do it the best.
0439023491|5.0|I was also one of the lucky few to get a hold of one of the ARC's. This book does NOT disappoint! Just like the Hunger Games, I laughed, I cried and there were several scenes that gave me chills. The last line of the book STILL brings me chills. It is very well written and there are no \\"slow parts\\" to the book. When I was done reading the Hunger Games, I was hoping that Katniss would choose Peeta. Suzanne has written Catching Fire so well that now I don't know who she should choose as Katniss needs both of them in different ways and they both are a big part of Katniss and who she is.<br />I am not so patiently awaiting the third book.....

I found The Forgotten Garden. Now, while Setterfield hasn't written any other novels, Morton has. So, I will be checking out her other books, maybe I can find another gem.

On the other hand, when one has written a masterpiece such as Small World, one can be forgiven pretty much anything else. He is still one of the very best authors writing in English today, and deserves a better editor.

Alex and Brittany are characters that makes you really want to root for them.  They are each forced to put up a facade by the society that they live in.  As their lives intertwine because of a chemistry class, they begin to realize that they are not the stereotypical people everyone believes them to be.    Buy this book!!!

B001QGRIO8|5.0|I bought three of the books.  This one I couldn't wait to go to the store or for it to be delivered from an online store.  So, I downloaded it as an E-book.  It cost more but was totally worth it.  Now I am going to order the last one so I can have the complete series.  Stephanie enveloped us in a sea of emotion from beginning to end.  I have watched everything from Nosferatu to the recent Moonlight series, over the years. I was very disappointed that the network (CBS) chose not to renew it and did so without warning.  Apparently so were 8 million other viewers.  But I digress...    I have read all of Ann Rice's vampire books and other authors, as well.  I loved it that he convinced her to marry him.  The whole story was wonderful.  I loved the way she \\"wrapped\\" things up.  Ms. Meyer told a vampire story that was truly fresh, fun and dealt with a lot of teenage emotions.  She treated her characters lovingly and patiently.  She dealt with the expectation of violence from the two largest vampire clans in a manner that was believable.      The bad reviews make no sense to me.  But then I am older than a teenager.  So perhaps I see it from a wiser and more relaxed (LOL) angle.  Keep up the great work Stephanie.  I can't wait for New Moon, the movie to be released in November.  I have to buy all the videos, too.  This is a must have collection for any vampire enthusiast.
B000784WMW|5.0|There have been many versions of Jane Eyre in the world of drama, however, this is my ultimate favourite of all times.  The actors and acting were superb, well matched, and I know that if in the afterworld Charlotte is fortunate enough to be watching she would approve of these choices.      Although I always loved the novel and its prose, I never encountered a version that did not leave me wanting in the way such lines were delivered.  Even the so praised 2006 version did not display the passion that endured from the beginning between Jane and Rochester.  Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton were indeed able to get under the skin of the novel's heroine and hero, thus delivering a version of the story that will be difficult to duplicate. One could see how subtly his eyes followed her every move in the initial scene; and as for her, she hardly had the opportunity to look at a man (especially a formed man, twice her age), but in spite of that she held her own, and certainly was not timid delivering her lines.  I particularly enjoyed the scene where she was summoned to \\"entertain\\" him and where he wished to \\"draw her out more.\\"  She, in turn, ended up drawing him out far more that he intended.  But that was, in my opinion, what Ms. Bronte intended from the beginning -- to show a soft, intelligent and gentle person that could not be corrupted simply by male arrogance.  The rest of the story speaks for itself and I still need a hankie whenever I watch the parting scene --  Dalton can NEVER be surpassed...  I've never been a fan and never have seen him as 007 since I am not an 007 type of woman, but this portrayal should be placed amongst the best in film.      I can now rest since the perfect match was found (even though I was 26 years too late in discovering it).
B0002F6AH0|3.0|I viewed the entire 11 volume DVD set.  I was somewhat disappointed for the following reasons...    1) This was entirely a view of the war from the British and European perspective.  The contributions of America in defeating Nazi Germany were mostly downplayed and sometimes ignored.  This is especially true in the effort to liberate France.  Patton, and his accomplishments, were completely ignored and not covered.  It was all Monty.  Again, a British perspective.  You would have thought that it was only the English and Russians that won the European theater.  (Or, maybe I have a bias here.)    2) There is nothing new here.  It's just all of the episodes of the old World At War series.  I was hoping for a fresh perspective on the entire war based upon the latest historical data and new interpretations of that data.  Not!!!  The advertising, as everyone else has mentioned, is totally misleading and probably criminal.    3) America's fight to defeat the Japanese was wanting.  The producer, in the introduction to the series, made it clear that they did not cover the sea battles all that well.  It's still not clear as to why.  Again, the bias I mentioned.  Monty and Stalin weren't significantly involved with the defeat of the Japanese.  That was all America.    Conclusions:  If I had this to do all over again, I probably wouldn't purchase this series.  Though it was nice to hear directly from some of the key players in the war (Hitler's secretary, Himmler's henchmen, etc.)  So, from a purely historical perspective, one would probably want to own it, just for the sake of owning it.    It would be great if some producer would create one of these series, updated, from the American perspective.  It's about time.  That's the series I'd purchase in a heartbeat.    Unless you're a die-hard WWII buff, don't bother purchasing this series.

015206396X|4.0|I wasn't sitting on my seat the entire way through the book, but it was entertaining nonetheless.  There were one or two climaxes in the book which fell short of my expectations after putting on a well written introduction to them.  It is very comparable to the Hunger Games (which I enjoyed) and the love story doesn't get too sickening to handle.  I recommend to anyone who likes this genre.
B00288KNLS|5.0|I loved this film adaptation of Coraline!  If you like creepy movies that are also brilliantly imaginative, artistically beautiful, full of wit and good writing, this is the movie for you!<br /><br />As most folks know, this story is about a little girl who feels neglected.  The family has just moved to a new area, and all her friends are, of course, left behind.  In the film, there is a little boy that helps with the explication, and sets up the creepiness of the old house (divided into flats) in which Coraline now lives.<br /><br />Coraline finds a door to another world with a sort of \\"duplicate\\" family, one that pays more attention to her.  What will happen?  I don't want to say more!  But it is a wonderful story.  Actually, it is difficult to say what is more fantastical in regards to her neighbors:  They are just as interesting in the \\"real world\\"!  Absolutely wonderful, over the top, voice characterizations.<br /><br />A member of my family has a phobia regarding buttons (this is really true!), which play a certain part in the film, and still found the film entrancing!<br /><br />I hope everyone that loves movies and a good story sees this.  One small point:  not for little kids.  This is genuinely scary in places!
B001AVCFK6|5.0|Let me start off by saying that I am new to Star Trek. This movie is literally my first introduction. I had always presumed Star Trek played more to a guy's interest. This movie proved to me exactly how wrong I was. It has been a long time since I was completely captivated while watching a movie.    Star Trek contains everything one could desire in a movie: action, adventure, suspense and humor. A lot more humor than a novice might expect. Altogether this is the best movie I have seen all year. I was absolutely enthralled the entire time I was watching it. I couldn't be happier I put my prejudices aside or else I would have missed out on a great film. Now I can't wait for the next installment! Highly recommended.
0385335997|2.0|Like many others, I loved Outlander. I must have read it 3 times in as many weeks. I enjoyed Dragonfly quite a bit and thought it a well written, if painful, continuation of the story. I had high hopes for Voyager, but now I have no plans to read the continuing saga.     I'm willing to give the author leeway in a lot of areas and I must admit that at times Voyager really did enthrall me. Some of the moments between Claire and Jamie were all I hoped them to be. But those were the few bright spots in what I thought was a largely disappointing book.     The areas I can't get past....    1. Some of the plot points were downright ridiculous. I found the mysticism of the first two books a nice balance between the tangible and the unexplainable. The 'weirdness' factor in this racheted up quite a bit and I found myself, instead of being open to the possibilities, skipping pages until something more realistic happened. In addition, some of the logic was sketchy or way off. The most painful leap, to me, happens when one character does another character a favor. This favor could have been done several years earlier, in my opinion, with really no excuse as to why it wasn't done so. My only conclusion is that it was for selfish reasons - so why does a great friendship come out of this?? There were so many times when I was reading and thinking \\"Really? You can't see any other way out of this?\\"    2. The 'coincidences' in this book are so ASTOUNDING it makes the plot seem extremely contrived. I can't shelve my logic long enough to accept all of the little convenient plot twists that happen. Coupled with the mystical weirdness, I found myself saying \\"Hmmm... You don't say,\\" way too much. I'm open to the sense of fate the first two books inspire. Nothing in this book felt like fate - just like a failing story needing more 'twists' to make it interesting.     3. The writing is painfully repetitive; a good editor was obviously lacking here. I also found myself getting irritated with little details that seemed wrong. Is Jamie's scar on his right or left hand?? I'm pretty sure it's on his left, but Claire seems to find it on his right at times.    4. All of the main characters do things extremely out of character at different times. Some of what Jamie, Claire and Jenny do were so surprising to me, I really thought less of characters. I don't expect them to be perfect (they made plenty of mistakes and bad decisions in the first two books), but they shouldn't do things completely out of left field. You would expect wisdom and determination at their ages, especially with all they've survived. Instead, you wonder, at times, if you even know them at all.    5. It was more of an adventure story than the reunion story I had hoped it would be. There was so little time devoted to Jamie and Claire as a couple, I found myself longing for some boring times just so I could be with them. And, since I found the adventure largely unbelievable, I was irritated with the plot.    There are a lot of other problems I have, but there is really no sense in cataloging any more. I was glad to see Claire and Jamie reunited, but I do regret what this book has done to my sense of the characters and story. Coupled with the mediocre reviews of the later books, I have no intention of reading further. I figure if I give it some time, I'll be able to read Outlander again with some of the joy it brought me initially - the author can truly be proud of that work. I'd rather let my own imagination, however, continue the story.
B00005QGAV|5.0|Michael Jackson's album Dangerous lead into what would become the greatest world tour of its time and the song follows his path of improving and changing styles.  This album features a hard-rock single and it also is the first time Jackson would insert rapping interludes- I'm not one for rap, but Jackson always made sure they fit into the song.<br /><br />This is one of the greatest selling albums of all time, just barely beating out Bad as Jackson's second biggest selling album.  People said in Dangerous that Jackson had become a mechanical entertainer, but I strongly disagree.  I find his work in Dangerous just as good as previous albums even though its highlight singles may not be on the level of some of his previous songs.<br /><br />Album Highlights Include:<br /><br />Jam - A very fast paced tune from the King of Pop provides an exciting start to this excellent album, and features a very fun tune and rap interlude.  Like other fast-paced songs from Jackson the lyrics are spoken at a machinegun pace and are hard to get if you don't pay attention.  The music video featured the other MJ: the King of Ball (Basketball, to be exact) Michael Jordon.<br /><br />In The Closet - A smooth, sexually suggestive song with a crisp beat and lyrics.  Some may remember its sexually stimulating music video.<br /><br />Remember The Time - Another crisp, smooth love song from Michael.  The music video was set in Ancient Egypt.<br /><br />Heal the World - The song written to launch Jackson's Heal the World charity which continues to operate `til this day.  It is in the style of his previous \\"change the world\\" song Man in the Mirror.<br /><br />Black Or White - The song's most infamous single is exciting and expresses strongly the desire for race equality.  This unedited version includes an introduction similar to that of the Black Or White video with Macaulay Culkin.  With guitar solos provided by the infamous Slash the song is incredible.<br /><br />Give In To Me - What I believe to be Michael Jackson's most underrated song this Rock & Roll piece (Once more featuring guitarist Slash) worth looking into by not just fans of Michael Jackson or pop, but people who enjoy real Rock music.

Also, having grown up on his stage performance version of the song I'd have to say I prefer the lyric arrangements in the stage-performance version over the actual song.  Still, a good piece nonetheless.<br /><br />Going to some of the critical complaints of Dangerous and later Invincible were the length of these albums.  A ridiculous thing, because when I spend my money on a CD I'm happy to know that Jackson always made sure you got plenty of bang for your buck.  Dangerous contains fourteen tracks, and sure, the arrangement and transition between pieces may be a tad off, but at the same time -considering Jackson so rarely released albums- I'm relieved that he always made sure to respect the buyer by making sure their dollar would buy more than most other CDs which average 8-12 tracks.<br /><br />Dangerous is not as diverse an album as some of his other works (Thriller, Bad, Invincible), but it defiantly contains the King's spark of creativity in every second of its running time.<br /><br />Also: Make sure to check out Michael Jackson's DVD concert 'Michael Jackson - Live in Bucharest: The Dangerous Tour'.

A ridiculous thing, because when I spend my money on a CD I'm happy to know that Jackson always made sure you got plenty of bang for your buck.  Dangerous contains fourteen tracks, and sure, the arrangement and transition between pieces may be a tad off, but at the same time -considering Jackson so rarely released albums- I'm relieved that he always made sure to respect the buyer by making sure their dollar would buy more than most other CDs which average 8-12 tracks.      Dangerous is not as diverse an album as some of his other works (Thriller, Bad, Invincible), but it defiantly contains the King's spark of creativity in every second of its running time.      Also: Make sure to check out Michael Jackson's DVD concert 'Michael Jackson - Live in Bucharest: The Dangerous Tour'.  It will blow you away!
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|Ill start off by saying, those who love FF7 probably own this and the original.<br /><br />For those who are into Final Fantasy, this is for you. You may have seen the spirits within and was slightly confused. This is nothing like that and actually hits closer to the more popular Final Fantasys.<br /><br />This is a perfect addition for a Blu-ray collection. The entire movie, for those who have remember the first, has been basically redone. Granted the bulk of the movie is the same as the original, it has much added to it. This is more like a 2.0 version rather than a 1.5. I suggest everyone pick this up
B001AVCFJM|5.0|This was waaaaayyyy better than the originals (might get some flack for that)Loved the twists and can't wait for the sequel - as long as they keep the same elements
B00284BMBM|5.0|I've listened to this album about 100 times since I got it a month ago - other than 1 or 2 songs, this is an excellent sophomore effort by Daughtry!  Usually skip over the first song - but play through the rest of them - favorite is Tennessee Line - simple, stripped down, just his voice and a few instruments without too many extras added in the studio.  Love the fiddle on that song.  Highly recommended - it's a great car trip album!
0385338082|3.0|I am a big fan of Kinsella's books, but the more I read of them, the more I feel she's rushing through to finish each one so that she can get it published, do some promotional work and then churn out another one. The last couple of chapters of this and 'Twenties Girl' seemed particularly rushed.  It was a fun read but I can't really relate to someone who's so secretive and embarrassed by everything! And I'm a bit bummed that certain themes are the same as the book I'm writing... maybe I should rush too!
B00192IV0O|1.0|What a sorry excuse for an album.  I WAS a black eyed pea fan till they came out with this.  I got a feeling is probably the single worst song created is a looooong time.  I hope they retire from music cuz there killin it right now.  Cant listen to the radio anymore cuz of these lame songs.
B00133KFGW|5.0|This movie is a wonderful movie and I highly recommend it for family movie night.
B001GCUER0|5.0|The acting, characters, sets, cinematography -- superb.  This series is reason enough to have a television and AMC.      The special features include an astounding number and variety of interesting mini-documentaries on cultural and news events of the Mad Men era. If possible, I'd give this series -- Seasons 1 and 2 -- 7 stars.
0307120007|5.0|This is my second copy of this wonderful book. My grandson wore out the first copy and now his younger sister is enjoying the new book. Favorite page, hands down, is the peek-a-boo page but my grandbabies participate in every page, looking, sniffing, feeling, waving. My granddaughter spied the book on our shelf and got very aggitated that we didn't see it and were offering her every other thing. When Pat the Bunny was handed to her, she smiled hugely, hugged it to her chest and then brought it to me to read. What could be better?
B000ZEE3I6|2.0|Yates should have given this project the same reverence and love that Peter Jackson and crew gave to Lord Of The Rings.  He did not.<br /><br />I gave Yates credit for creating a workable adaption of Order Of The Phoenix.  That was a very difficult book to make into a single film.<br /><br />The Half Blood Prince lacks heart.<br /><br />Yates nails the romantic relationships (Lavender is especially great), but this film is almost completely humorless.  No chaos, no ghosts, no delight, no madness, no fun.  It's dark, and it's only going to get darker.  Yawn.<br /><br />The biggest travesty is Jenny and Harry's first kiss.  That was a fantastic moment in the book, which Yates inexplicably made Hollywood ordinary.<br /><br />Michael Gambon's portrayal of Dumbledore, yet again, misses the character.  The actor steadfastly stated that he refused to read the books.  I'm not sure WHY he thought that this would benefit his characterization.  It does not.  I've cringed watching him screw up one of the most important characters.<br /><br />If you want a GREAT adaption of all of the books, listen to the audio versions by Jim Dale.  Jim Dale single-handedly nails all of the parts.<br /><br />Perhaps someone will make great film adaptions of the Harry Potter books in my lifetime.  These films feel like an endurance test, not something be excited about and relish.
1588167461|5.0|Are you a man who simply wants to dress better without being mistaken for a metrosexual? If you are, this book is definitely something you can use. Divided into different bite-sized chapters, each packed with useful information and photos, the Esquire Handbook of Style is intended as an introduction to a world of classic men's style that is both elegant and masculine. While much of the material in here is recycled from various articles from Esquire magazine that you may have already read, it's great having it organized and in one place.     The focus is almost always on dressier clothing that white-collar professionals would wear to the office, as well as what to wear to the theater, restaurants, weekending, etc. We are repeatedly given the message that a modest amount of quality clothes chosen tastefully will serve us much better than a large number of cheap, trendy clothes. It's a message that many of us do need to hear over and over, because moderately-priced clothing stores often push cheaply manufactured knockoffs of current trends and leave us with the impression that unless we wear the very latest styles we look awful. The Esquire Handbook of Style takes a totally different approach, and shows not only how to determine quality in clothing before you buy, but also how versatile the basic building blocks of a man's wardrobe really are.    This is intended as a long-term reference book. Almost all the photos are of Golden Age Hollywood celebs such as Fred Astaire and Cary Grant. The binding, quality of paper, and the cover itself suggest that this is a book that you can use throughout your life. Indeed, it's so well-bound that you might mistake it for a vintage book.    I think this is a great book for recent high school grads or for college students who need to score a plum internship or first 'real' job. This is an excellent and readable book for any male making the transition from a career in which wardrobe is not an issue (such as college education, or a jobin which you need to wear a uniform) to one where you are expected to present a crisp business-like appearance. I personally wish I'd had this book years ago as it would have made my adaptation to the office much easier.    The only downside I can see to this book is that the accessories chapter is much too brief. This is unfortunate because it isn't entirely clear why you would want to learn to knot several different styles for neckties, what materials or stitching are best for neckties, etc. It could simply be that the editors regard the rules regarding neckwear to be much looser than the rules regarding shirts and jackets, but its all too easy for men to slip into the habit of ruining an otherwise great look with a hideously garish (and often over-priced) tie. I would have liked to see more about this, as well as options regarding the appropriateness of lapel pins and pocket watches.
B000RZGIQ8|5.0|The only acceptable reason for not watching this film is because you are still busy watching \\"Tommy Boy.\\"
B00009AOBI|5.0|Movie showed up very quickly after placing the order and it is in excellent condition. Thank you.
0802136834|5.0|Wonderful accurate book.<br />Alison Weir is the Great Master of British History.<br />I loved it.
B001BTQBQQ|5.0|This was an unusual and very interesting fictional-historical piece, with non-stop drama and a high degree of well-edited action scenes,that I have watched over 20 times, and I always see something new each time that I watch it.   One thing that I liked about it was that I was not familiar with most of the film's cast, and their progressive character development was really excellent, which allows the viewer to get very absorbed with the story.    The director, Roland Emmerich,and his staff really did a great techical research job of making this story quite believable, and the editing was excellent on a film that should become a cult classic someday like Star Wars, but time will tell about that.   I like films like this when these fictional, historical-based productions are produced,i.e.:the HBO series \\"Rome\\" and Deadwood\\" were, as it makes one think about the sacrifices by those who came before us lived in their time.
B000W91RUG|5.0|Great price.  I was wanting to get this and went to Best Buy, I could not believe the price; it was in the $50 range.  No show is worth that for one season.  Amazon's price was great.  The show is hilarious, it will be one of the greats.
B00000DHZJ|4.0|Two selections need to be on this compilation; \\"51st Anniversery\\" and \\"Wait Until Tomorrow\\". That would make it almost perfect.
0553328255|4.0|Being that much of these compilation was written over a hundred years ago the writing is surprisingly modern. All of my experience with Sherlock Holmes has previously been with TV and Movies. The books are much better. Fully fleshed out characters (Holmes isn't someone you'd invite over for dinner unless you needed his expertise), simple but elegant place and mood descriptions. Sir Arthur could write.    The only reason I didn't give it a five is that it's obvious Sir Arthur was tiring of the character and was sometime just punching out the stories to meet the demand. Still, hidden inside most stories is some redeemable character or place description.
0316044695|5.0|This book was a great read for anyone who loves this country- yes, Marcus has his opinions about the \\"liberal media\\" and liberal politicians, but read the book and you'll see why he feels this way. You don't have to love George W. Bush to love this story. A tragic story of survival after a mission goes all wrong, the book is an inspiration and moves even the toughest to tears in a feel good way. Faith is tested and confirmed. Makes me continue to marvel at our young men and women who serve- especially in our special forces. I'm always interested in books about the storied SEALs and their training, and Marcus lays it all out. Awesome read!
0739368435|3.0|I was very eager to start this book, but it is not a gripping story and I have put it down without finishing for now. I am about 2/3 through. I will finish it eventually, when I am in a melancholy mood.
B0026SCMNM|2.0|I bought this based on the other reviews, however I  was disappointed in this book.  Not because it is slow moving, which it is, but because the heroine is flat and uninteresting.  I even found myself disliking Eilis.  She shows little emotion and has little interest in or compassion for others. I understand she is Irish Catholic and her upbringing has taught her to  hide her emotions, but except for rare, unexpected bursts of emotion, she is almost devoid of feeling anything.  She cares for her family but in an odd, detached way.  She comes across as self absorbed.  This is  picky, but there's never even the vaguest hint at what she looks like, aside from hair problems on the boat, there are no descriptions of her.  The book is well written, but I found it lacking in soul.  In the end I didn't care what Eilis did.
B00288KNL8|2.0|I watched this movie, and it was creepy to say the least.  It is not my type of animated movie however.  I thought all of Tim Burton's works were lame.  I am more impressed with the animation work in Alvin And The Chipmunks, Ice Age, and Shrek.  These movies had less sinister plots, and were good enough for the entire the family.  Coraline isn't one of those movies that most parents would want their children to watch.  I guess it's one of those movies that you either really like, or don't like.
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|When I looked this CD up on Amazon, I almost couldn't believe the price. However, when I recieved the CD and it was the WHOLE album I was stoked at the great deals, here, on Amazon. I was extremely satisfied with my purchase!
B000RZIGVS|2.0|I am an avid Star Trek fan and love The Next Generation Series.  I was suprised when the package come in the US mail from China. I was also suprised with the packaging was different than the 'usual' packaging of my other Star Trek Series DVDs. I have not yet watched all of the discs but the first one does have a flaw in the picture.  the disc gets stuck on a segment and then skips to another chapter. The next disc worked fine.  I would not recommend buying from this supplier again.
1575666286|5.0|If you haven't done your research on Dr. Max Gerson you should.  His work is well documented you just have to search.  See in America we aren't just told about this stuff.  The people that do make a great profit off the sick do a great job of keeping this material hidden.  Watch the movie \\"Dying to have known.\\"    It's sad that the government can tell us how we can get better.  Only surgery, chemo and radiation are PERMITTED by our government as health options.  Wow.
1594489505|5.0|This story blew me away.......just talking about this book with people gives me goose bumps.  this is a story to read and then digest for awhile, nothing you read after will be nearly as good.  I haven't been able to pick up another book. I hope Khaled Hosseini writes another as his story telling is superb.  Highly recommend this book to anyone who can read.
B001EN71DG|5.0|I've watched it a few times with my daughters. I like the digitally mastered version - the sound and picture are superb. You should not missed it even you're not a die-hard fan of Star Wars.
B002COTI64|5.0|Spektor's voice is pure, honest, and refreshing. With crystal-clear ease, her melody twists around playfully in tantalizing patterns. Every song is fun and unique, but meaningful at the same time. There's so much to chew on here; you can listen to it again and again without getting bored. From the serene \\"Blue Lips\\" and \\"Human of the Year\\" to the upbeat \\"Machine\\" and \\"Dance Anthem of the '80s,\\" the songs cover a wide array of attitudes and emotions. Nonetheless, they flow seamlessly into one long stream of pure music. The lyrics are unique, and the vignettes Spektor depicts are priceless. If you're looking for a female vocalist to sing her heart out on top of gorgeous keyboard harmonies into a relaxing night, this might be the album you're looking for.
B001K3JF7K|2.0|I am Diana's big fan and I have all her albums. But this time I am very disappointed at Quiet Night. Every song is so flat and bland. Easy listening? Yes. But it also makes you sleepy. Depth? Absolutely not! If you want to spend the wonderful night with nice jazz music, go find her early trio albums. If you have trouble sleeping, this album won't let you down.
B0014KFV6I|4.0|There has been a lot said about this album that I feel that there is nothing really left to say but get this album if you havent heard it.
B0025X4P24|5.0|I am a jazz fan, and would have not bought this CD except I saw Vanessa Williams on Good Morning America sing \\"The Real Thing\\", which is a Sergio Mendes/Brasil 77 Classic.  Just on that rendition alone it is worth the purchase price.    \\"Just Friends\\" and \\"I Fell In\\" are great examples of her vocal strengths.  I think it is a great CD and people who have panned it are those who simply do not \\"get-in\\" to this type of music.  You can't please them all...listen to the samples and make up your own mind.
B0029P6LH0|4.0|...due to not being born yet this is as good as it gets for me as far as hearing them live at the time.
B000083C49|2.0|The Enterprise crew travels back in time to... 1980s San Francisco. Not exactly the high point in American culture. The acting falls flat and the humor loses its novelty. I really liked this movie as a kid, but now it just seems silly and stuck with that 1980s vibe. It hasn't stood the test of time, in my opinion.     What do I mean by stuck in the 80s? Case in point: Kirk and Dr. Taylor go to a fancy Italian restaurant in San Francisco, at which their table is set with breadsticks, and Kirk orders a Michelob beer (as opposed to there being french bread, olive oil, and a fine wine). Is that an example of how tasteless \\"fancy\\" restaurants were in the '80s, or a case of bad '80s moviemaking? Or a joke? I don't know. Either way, I didn't appreciate the flourishes.     As a Trek fan though, you can't miss this one, and you'll just have to look over the movie's foibles. It certainly stands out from the other Trek movies with its attempted humor, especially after the darker and more cerebral Star Trek II and III movies.
B00136Q6DA|3.0|I know there's really no comparison but they both have Vegas songs, only that Sara's is about going to Vegas and Katy's is about Waking up In Vegas. Sara had a catchy single with Love Song, however the words and music have gotten slightly annoying to me due to being overplayed on the radio. The rest of the album is great but no classic. I hope that her second album will be even better.
B0002KPHXS|4.0|\\"Intermezzo\\" is a tale of forbidden love, running only 70 minutes, that introduced Ingrid Bergman to American audiences in 1939. It's a remake of a 1936 Swedish film that also starred Bergman in the role of a young woman who falls in love with a married man. Holger Brandt (Leslie Howard) is a concert violinist who spends most of his time away from his family, touring with his accompanist Thomas Stenborg (John Halliday). But Stenborg plans to retire, so Brandt retreats to his country home to be with his family for a while. There, he is introduced to his young daughter's piano teacher, Anita Hoffman (Ingrid Bergman). Holger is taken with Anita's playing and then with her charm, but their illicit affair threatens to come between Holger and the family he holds dear.<br /><br />The film feels like a vignette. It captures the brief interlude that Anita and Holger share between the greater acts of their lives: the intermezzo. It is sentimental, not only about their affair, but in particular in regards to Holger's family. It isn't quite sappy, though. We never know much about the emotional lives of the characters beyond their feelings for each other, but \\"Intermezzo\\" is entertaining enough, and Ingrid Bergman is radiant. Anita doesn't have the glamour or worldliness of some of the characters that would later make Bergman famous, but it's easy to see what made her a movie star. \\"Intermezzo\\" looks good and sounds good, thanks to a musical score by Max Steiner. The MGM 2004 DVD has no bonus features, but the print is good. Subtitles are available in English, French, Spanish.
B001KO8JYE|4.0|but she's great. My favorite song on this album is sinkin soon. Get this album if you enjoy jazz and previous Norah albums.
B0017SWSCW|4.0|quite the page turner....slightly far-fetched at times, but believable....I thoroughly enjoyed this novel, it is definitely worth reading....archer remains one of my favorites....kane and abel & the prodigal daughter still hold down the top two spots for me though!.....
B0018RBN8C|4.0|This is a good album. Duffy (I wish I could stop seeing Buffy when I see that name) has her own style so its hard to compare her with other contemporary artists. Her voice is unique so maybe a less edgier Feist? Her songs have a bit of that 60s sound without sounding too vintage-in fact they sound quite modern. So stop reading and start listening.
0385342020|4.0|After reading a product review of this book, I did not think I was going to be interested in a ghost story.  However, I am a fan of Sophia Kinsella's numerous other novels, so as a loyal reader, I purchased this.  Having finished the book and laughing out loud several times, I am certainly glad I made the purchase.  Although it is not my favorite Kinsella book, it was very enjoyable.  Trust me, once you're halfway through, you won't want to put it down.
B000T1D9KS|4.0|I got this because I loved Like A Star and was so glad to discover that the rest of this album was just as good. Her voice is so good-go for it get this album!
B00005JKGZ|5.0|i have had several bad experiences recently with items bought from amazon.  i have not had the sellers OR amazon even reply to my many requests for attention to them.  i was reluctant to purchase again, but we really wanted this movie and its hard to find.  we are pleasantly surprised with the great condition and have enjoyed the great memories it has brought us.   i am happy i took the chance.   thank you Michele
B001L2EE9Y|4.0|Its not the greatest album ever made-but if you truly enjoy Joni and her voice then Blue is just right for you. My favorite song is All I Want-a song I feel that very much still has that free spirit 60s vibe.
B0000042MY|2.0|I was going by memory of faint music I had heard in a museum when I ordered the sound track of The Last of the Mohicans. It turned out to be a disappointment. The sound track uses electronic music instead of an orchestra, and so the music sounds artificial to me. I am a big fan of original score sound tracks, but they usually use orchestral instruments, which sound much better.
B0026RHR6K|1.0|First, let me make clear that my rating and review are for the packaging itself and NOT for the show. I think BSG is an all-time Top Ten -- if not Top Five -- show.    But, the packaging is just awful! As others have commented, the individual boxes holding each season's disc are horrible. In order to remove any disc other than the top/first one, you have to remove all the others above/before it. Otherwise, it's just not going to come out without tearing the packaging or damaging the disc. And, you have to do the same thing to put a disc back, unless it's the top/first one.    I honestly can't believe that this package design was approved.    Unless you're looking to save money by buying the complete series, I strongly urge you to buy each season individually.
0385342020|4.0|Sophie Kinsella has done it again! \\"Twentie's Girl\\" is a cute, romantic mystery/comedy.  Her characters are fun and very easy to imagine in real life.  The story itself is completely fictional with her Great Aunt being a ghost, but it makes for a cute story.  It is somewhat predictable, but well worth the read. If you like fun, light reads that make you want to read more of the author's books, read \\"Twenties Girl\\" and you will not be disappointed!
B0000CDJPQ|5.0|worked exactly as promised, the delivery was made in 2 days (regular shipping), and I have been nothing but pleased.
0307454541|5.0|This is not a book I would typically read.  The mystery is a book I typically avoid at all costs.  However, this book is amazingly written and kept me on the edge of my seat turning pages!  I had a co-worker give me this book because she wasn't sure she could get into it.  Initially, I felt the same way, but after reading the forward, I was instantly curious how it all turned out.  I am going to recommend this to my co-worker and tell her that she must give it a second chance!  I can't wait until I can get my hands on the next book in the series!
B00004YZFR|3.0|i never saw this dvd but i had to give it a rating. im here to talk about another video. it is emotional rescue video. i am looking for the full version without the thermo. they destroyed that one by putting in the thermo shots. that was the best performance i ever saw of the stones. it was in the studio and the performance was excellent. i saw it back in 1981 on the solid gold show and never saw it since. its on the vhs tape called video rewind but they cut the video down to nothing with thermo shots. and it was recently put on you tube but they removed it quickly. what is the reason for this. did someone buy the rites or something. please release the full studio version video of emotional rescue with no thermo shots at all. i would pay 300 dollars for it. thank you very much
B000PFU7OO|5.0|This is a wonderful soundtrack. I would recommend it to anyone! And if you haven't seen the movie it's from, be sure you do. The movie was fantastic! Seeing the movie is what prompted me to go find the soundtrack!
B000002UJQ|5.0|If for some reason you've still not heard OK Computer and you're on the fence about whether or not to get it, all you need do is look at the volume of responses this album has received.  At the time of writing, over 2,051 reviews have been logged.  Truly great works are always provocative, they provoke responses one way or another. To be sure, most reviews give this album the 5 stars it deserves, but even the haters, in an odd way, pay tribute to this masterstroke.  This is easily one of the 5 greatest albums in rock history.  Listen for yourself. ;-)
B00003CXE7|5.0|This is an awesome movie and the DVDs (along with the bonus DVD)are of very high picture quality.
B000H5TVKI|5.0|The name Rambo brings to mind wild action as a one man army takes on 100's if not thousands of the enemy.  Blood, guts, and a high body count.    First Blood is before that nonsense.  Before the action movie hype.  It has a story that really has not played out in other movies as much.  We see a lot of movies like Full metal Jacket and Platoon but how about a serious movie about what happens to our boys once they come home?  Flags of our Fathers attempted this but not like the First Blood.    The plot is the core of this movie.  Rambo returns from Nam to find a world different than the one he left behind.  Almost everyone he cared about has died and he caries a huge mental and physical burden from his service in Asia.  Without giving too much away Rambo must trys to comform back into the world but can not adapt.  He is still haunted by the ghosts of his past and when a arrogant jerk of a Sheriff and one of his henchmen abuse Rambo then he snaps back into the jungle mentality.    This movie has a little bit of action but not much.  In fact the 'body count' is very very small.  Rambo does not want a fight, he just wants to surive and does his best to do so without hurting the people he was fighting for and sacrificed so much.    The Blu Ray looks amazing and gives incredible detail.  There were a lot of dark sceens which made the old VHS and DVD harder to see certain parts like at night or in the caves but here it comes out much better.    If you want some a solid story about a topic we do not hear much about, then Rambo is your movie.  Do not over look it due to the later action movies as they are not similar at all.  I highly recomend this movie to anyone.
1416955070|2.0|15-year old Clary witnesses a crime at a trendy New York night club. Interesting thing, nobody but Clary can see both the victim and perpetrators. As it turns out, there is an entire invisible to regular people world, and Clary is an unaware important part of it.<br /><br />\\"City of Bones\\" is one of those books that all my female friends and fellow readers simply love, Jace-mania all around. Needless to say, I had to jump on the bandwagon eventually and get me some Jace. Who am I to deny myself a pleasure to fall for a fictional hot, sarcastic and brooding guy? Imagine my disappointment, when I found out that this book was one big pile of hot mess! Sorry ladies, I said it, it's bad.<br /><br />I had the hardest time sticking to the story and for quite some time I couldn't figure out why. Then gradually I realized that there were several reasons.<br /><br />Let me start with the editing. I don't really think this book was edited at all, actually. Errors are endless and visible to even my untrained eye: wrong words (\\"noise\\" instead on \\"nose\\"); missing words in sentences; strange mix of POVs (the book is mostly told in 3rd person, from Clary's POV, but occasionally I saw both 3rd and 1st person narration in the same paragraph describing the same events, then there was a page from Jace's POV and a chapter from Luke's); Clary's father was called Jonathan in the beginning of the book, but John in the end. I can go on, but these are the things that I would normally overlook if the story itself is good, but it wasn't.<br /><br />I didn't think that the story was cohesive, it just didn't quite flow for me. It read as more of a series of events rather than a novel. I thought there were some parts that served no other purpose but to give our hero an opportunity to act knight-like. I am talking about the entire rat-Simon/vampires extravaganza. This story line could have been edited out completely without any damage to the narrative IMO.<br /><br />I couldn't quite relate to any of the characters either. What made my friends sigh with adoration, annoyed me. I hated the sarcasm, mainly because the jokes, although funny, felt often out of place, plus all of the characters attempting to joke, sounded exactly the same. I didn't feel the difference in attitudes of Clary, Simon, and Jace. If Clare had to make Jace a witty sarcastic type, she should have made the wisecracks his trademark, not everybody's.<br /><br />The story itself was so ridiculously predictable! I do not normally see what is to come in the books, but in COB, I saw every \\"revelation\\" coming. Clare just doesn't have a skill to lead to them subtly, it's always in your face: \\"Valentine is alive\\" revelation (who in this book who was thought to be dead was actually dead? - a serious question), \\"your mother put a spell on you\\" revelation,  the big \\"father/brother\\" revelation - I could see them all, and I am not the most astute reader out there.<br /><br />Now, my biggest problem with this book - I've read/watched it all before! Clare borrows so liberally from \\"Star Wars,\\" \\"Harry Potter\\" and \\"Buffy,\\" it is simply impossible to overlook. Valentine - Voldemort/Darth Vader combo; Jace/Clary - Luke/Draco/Leia/Ginny (if it is possible) combo; the Circle - reversed Order of the Phoenix/Death Eaters combo; the Clave - Ministry of Magic; Luke - Lupin; Hodge - Giles/Wormtail combo. I can continue, but will stop here, you get the picture. Granted, there is nothing absolutely original in paranormal genre, but a skillful writer can re-work an old theme and make it new, fresh and original. Whatever is original in COB, is not quite thought through. As an example, let's take a \\"stele.\\" After finishing this book, I still have no idea what exactly it does - do you only write runes with it? how exactly do you use it in a battle? why it can open some doors and not others? it can heal, but not everything? it can make you be able to see through a wooden screen, but is it because you write a special rune with it or you use it as a wand? It seems to me stele is pretty much used as a deus ex machina, convenient whenever a quick solution to a problem needed. Bottom line, all these makes for one unoriginal and messy imaginary world. And this is probably was the main reason why I couldn't connect with this book.<br /><br />Finally, I was a little surprised by some of Clare's creative choices. I found both flirtations of at least 35-year-old warlock with a gay teenage boy and reversed Leia/Luke extravaganza quite tacky if not disturbing. Although I know how Jace/Clary \\"family matter\\" is resolved in the end, I don't find possibly incestuous relationships appealing.<br /><br />This review might make it seem like COB is the worst book ever written. I wouldn't say so, after all, I've read \\"Breaking Dawn,\\" and that book doesn't have any plot. There were some nice Jace/Clary moments, the greenhouse birthday party comes to mind. But was COB the most blatantly unoriginal book I've ever read? Absolutely (although I haven't read \\"Eragon\\" yet, but I heard a lot about it).<br /><br />Would I recommend this book? Sure, many of my friends enjoyed it immensely. Will I continue on with the series? I don't think I will be able to convince myself to waste any more of my time on being mad at a book. I think I will just check out plot summaries on wiki and be done with the series.<br /><br />P.S. I just read that Cassandara Clare is an avid and famous in certain circles fanfiction writer.

B000002ITM|2.0|I bought this album because I love the song \\"Electric Crown\\". Additionally, I read a review stating that this was Testament's most melodic and non-thrash album of all their studio work. The statement is verifiable upon listening to it and Skolnick's lead work is searing on this one. However, the album lacks something and what that something is I'm not quite sure. Put it this way, I wouldn't replace it if I were to lose my current copy of the album.
B001VT1HCO|5.0|I really really enjoy this album. My bro got it and we share music. It is really outstanding. I really enjoy the 80s sound. A lil depressing at times but refreshing as well. I love orchestral-rock! 2 thumbs up lol
B00005ATZT|5.0|Let me be honest with you.  I'm 27 years old, I like to drink and smoke and hang out with my friends, and I could not wait to buy The Fugitive last week.  It was 1 cent used on Amazon and that made me so happy.  You can go through a million movies and TV shows in which someone false gets accused of a crime, but what you'll ultimately think of as your barometer for that sort of thing is The Fugitive.  It remains so exciting, tense, such a hair's breath away from total discovery.  It gets you so extraordinarily invested in the justice-demands-it plot of Harrison Ford's wrongly accused Dr. Kimball as it does Tommy Lee Jones's Agent Gerard.  I've liked a lot of strange foreign, indie, \\"old\\" movies over the years, but if I had a couple hours to spend on a cold day, I'd probably spend them with The Fugitive, caring about everyone, being pushed along bold storytelling momentum, stuck desperately wishing for justice and luck to work out just a minute longer for Sam Kimball - at least I'd know I'd be in good company.
0756405890|4.0|Rothfuss' first volume of The Kingkiller Chronicles slowly  builds a believable fantasy world, introduces interesting characters, and sets up problems to be resolved in subsequent volumes.  In other words, this is an excellent beginning to a novel in multiple volumes and not merely the first book in a series.      Rothfuss has a way with words (read his blog for a taste), and his prose is smooth and the action lucid.  The bulk of the tale is Kvothe's autobiography told in an out-of-the-way inn.  The framing story, of a traveler's arrival at the inn, how he found Kvothe, and what happens then, is revisited every few chapters.  The framing story is set up leisurely,  taking seven chapters, and that is perhaps where the book failed for some.  This part is necessary, however, not only for the plot and character points revealed, but because it establishes the tone of the story, signaling that it will be dense and strewn with questions not immediately answered.  Rothfuss requires the reader to think about what he's been told, to ask himself, why did that character say that? and, what did that action mean?  If you enjoy having your curiosity piqued in this way and are willing to wait to have it satisfied, then this is your kind of book.      I will admit to some irritation during the first half of the book, as Kvothe was just so durn smart.  If he heard or read something once, he remembered it perfectly.  If he learned to do a thing, he became an expert in short order.  He tottered dangerously close to Mary Sue territory, but never quite crossed the line.  After all, Kvothe's story is worth telling precisely because he is a remarkable individual.  If his infant self is eloquent and emotionally mature beyond his years, well, this is not unknown in the only child of affectionate parents who are rather remarkable themselves.  And for all his talents, Kvothe does not have an easy life.  He is too busy scrambling to have time to become complaisant or smug (well, too smug anyway).  I also niggled at what seemed an overwhelmingly male cast--  Kvothe's perfect mother is nearly the only woman for a long stretch and seemed to foretell female characters who were nothing but stock gender types.  Perhaps, though,  pre-adolescent boys can't help but see the world as made up of other males and Mom.  In any case, once Kvothe attends university, several well-realized female characters are introduced.  After Kvothe receives a valuable insight on women's lives from a minor character, I was reassured that Rothfuss gets it.      The book deserves a better cover than my trade paperback edition, which is so full of fail it's not funny.  The stock image of Emperor Palpatine against a windswept landscape does kind of apply to the story, but the high-contrast, low-saturation look is just plain ugly.  It kept me from picking up this book for too long.  I prefer either of the two Donato covers.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I really love this movie. If one has not seen the shows I would recommend them.<br /><br />Aside for my rocoomendation, this film has been sold in many different forms but they are basically all the same.<br /><br />What I am trying to say is, if you own a copy you got it all. If they want to sell more of this series, they should make new movies, episodes. Never should they just repackage the same product over and over again.<br /><br />I still love the characters and the story, but am annoyed at buying the same product in a different package!
B001NFNFNU|3.0|A good job of recreating the time period, and it's not an easy film to watch. But did it have to be so LONG?!!? And how many times does she repeat her lines, \\"I want to find my son!\\" \\"Did you kill my son?\\" etc.  It's at times intense, sad, gruesome and makes one angry to see her frustration and how the L.A. police treated her and her search, but after 2 hours I just wanted to see it end.
B000NTPDSW|3.0|I agree with most of these reviews, positive and negative. The bottom line is that the dvd's are rather grainy but are still sharp quality. Its been a long time since I have owned a vhs player but Im sure that if I put the two side by side I would be able to tell a great diffrence in quality. However this generation is not trying to recapture 1970 for nostalgia, but blu ray quality for their big screen. All that aside I would reccomend this for its price and the quality thus far
078322740X|5.0|It is nice to watch these brilliant actors having fun in front of the camera in pleasant surroundings, supported by a good team of performers. Goldie Hawn is funny and her smile priceless. Although a fine comedienne, Goldie draws heavily on her spectacular legs and posterior in this movie. Fully aware of that, she doesn't hesitate making the most of them. However, the story is, as usual in this kind of movies, rather impossible and quite unbelievable, but it's good entertainment. Watching it is relaxing and one way getting in good mood without overloading the brain activity.
B000002I99|5.0|even after 35 years die-hard alice fans are still upset over the break-up of the original alice cooper group. depending on which source you choose to believe - alice grew bored and decided to go solo with  \\"welcome to my nightmare\\" while the band was taking a (well deserved) break and/or michael bruce, having grown tired of the theatrics, began work on his solo \\"in my own way\\" and neal smith soon followed with \\"platinum god\\".     (the band \\"billion dollar babies\\", including bruce, smith and dunaway released \\"battle axe\\" in 1977, smith and dunaway got together in \\"the flying tigers\\" in the late seventies, glen buxton returned to music in the mid eighties with the band \\"virgin\\" and all four former band members recorded together in 1998 with billy james in the band \\"ant-bee\\".  in 2006 the dennis dunaway project released \\"bones from the yard\\").    while we all hold our breath for a long overdue reunion, we can take comfort in the fact that @61, alice still performs most of his classics on tour and with each new studio release proves that he at least still has a sense of humor.     alice cooper's first solo effort was far removed from the classic rock and roll album, however \\"welcome to my nightmare\\" is considered a concept album masterpiece. where previous alice cooper group albums were all connected with \\"themes\\", alice wanted to create his version of \\"tommy\\" - with a fully developed story centering on the nightmares of a character called \\"steven\\".  produced by bob ezrin and creating a more mainstream alice while retaining the horror elements that made him famous, \\"nightmare\\" included the album, an hour long television special with vincent price (winning an emmy), and a huge theatrical stage show including pre-filmed projections on a giant screen, numerous dancers (including future wife sheryl) and a wide assortment of props. the hugely successful concert was filmed for theatrical release in 1975 and is now available on dvd.    backed by the best band money could buy,the album opened with the excellent title cut. alice provides lyrics with plenty of visual imagery, while the band puts the listener in the proper mood with layered brass, an almost funky bass line and very innovative guitar licks from dick wagner and steve hunter. the \\"devil's food/black widow\\" suite quickly seal your fate beginning with a great guitar riff before dissolving into an infamous recitation from vincent price. however, it is the centerpiece suite, \\"years ago/steven/the awakening\\", that is the true gem and remains a concert favorite to this day.    the rockers on the album are \\"cold ethyl\\" (\\"i love the dead\\" sequel), the great closer \\"escape\\", and the semi-anthem \\"department of youth\\" with a humorous nod to donny osmond. alice sings his first true ballad \\"only women bleed\\", a minor hit about spousal abuse, and even tips his hat to cabaret with the finger snapping \\"some folks\\", featuring a line of dancing skeletons in the live show.    reaching new heights, the \\"welcome to my nightmare\\" tour featured a giant screen with pre-filmed images that had alice bursting onto the stage while simultaneously disappearing from the screen. there was a bed with a giant toy box, dancing spiders & snakes and even a 9' tall cyclops. suzi quatro was the opening act. --set list: welcome to my nightmare/no more mr. nice guy/billion dollar babies/i'm eighteen/some folks/cold ethyl/only women bleed/devil's food/the black widow/steven/welcome to my nightmare (reprise)/the awakening/escape/school's out/department of youth    released february 1975 it reached #5 usa and #19 uk -- singles: department of youth b/w cold ethyl (#67) - only women bleed b/w devil's food (#12) - welcome to my nightmare b/w the black widow (#45)    every alice cooper album has great songs that never made radio. it's not the hits, but the deeper cuts that are the real black beauties... blinddog pick: year's ago / steven / the awakening
B0009XNUK0|3.0|This is a great compilation of Jackson's work from very early to late in his career. Only a few of my favorite songs were missing. Great price.
B001FB55H6|2.0|I'm sorry, but this movie just wasn't that good. I found it hard to attach myself to any of the characters. There were several graphic scenes that felt forced. But, I think the overall look of the film is fantastic. The quality of the film is superb. There were some magnificent moments that I won't ever forget, but this movie was just kind of boring. Dragged out. Not fluid. To me, it seems a lot of time, money and effort was wasted. I absolutely love comic-based movies and superhero movies and big-budget movies, but I parted with this blu-ray (which is an excellent transfer, by the way).
B001DHXT6G|1.0|OK, the good thing is they did proper scans of the earliest generation films possible.  That's about where it ends.  As everybody knows, they changed all the special effects shots.  I'll repharase, they replaced cheap, cheesy 1960s special effects with cheap, cheesy 2000s special effects.  They look hollow and fake at best.  So if they weren't going to put in a real effort, why bother replacing them?  At least the models used in the original series looked like actual objects rather than drawings.  As for the rest of the restoration, the newly recorded theme bothers me to no end.  They used the original monologue from Bill Shatner, why not the music?  The rest of the music was remixed from their 3-track sources and sound great, no problems there.  As for the picture, the image is noticably cleaner than it used to be, but they messed with the color/contrast a great deal, added people in the background where they didn't used to be.  Really, why did they do this?  I guess I'm in the school of thought where you ust don't mess with the classics.  A lot of people say \\"well if CG was available back then, they would have used it\\".  Yeah well, they didn't have CG so don't pretend they did by inserting it into an obviously 40+ year-old TV show.
B002BSRBRO|4.0|Since the first episode of season 2, there have been hints of some kind of catastrophe that is to come.  I was relieved to have an answer, though perhaps not the kind of answer I was looking for.  I have no intention of spoiling it for anyone, but will assure you that the season 2 finale will likely leave you wanting to come back for season 3.
B002DPH936|1.0|It would have been nice had Tim Burton produced a \\"Sweeney Todd\\" that did a certain amount of justice to Steven Sondheim's masterwork. Unfortunately, what Sondheim wrote and Burton put out bear only the most casual resemblance to each other ... namely, they have a lot of the same words and much of the same music - assuming that you prefer Shakespeare's witches acting like Wagner's norns (Anna Russell: \\"this dreary set of women\\"), or prefer Beethoven's 5th taken at the tempo of Chopin's funeral march. Blech!<br /><br />It should be noted that there are already available 2 other versions of this opera (yes, I know it has spoken dialogue, but so does Carmen when it's done properly). Both star the talented George Hearn as Sweeney. One is the 1982 fully staged version with Angela Lansbury grasping immortality as Mrs. Lovett. The other is the 2001 concert version with the great Patti LuPone. Ms LuPone does an undeniable star turn in this role, but fails to achieve Lansbury's high orbit. Hearn is a tremendous Sweeney, although in 2001 he's showing the 19 elapsed years since the last recording. I would recommend either of these entries, although my recommendation of the 1982 version is unqualified, enthusiastic, and excited.<br /><br />And now Tim Burton tackles the Demon Barber. Burton is an erratic director who often hits the heights but here sinks to a new low in this thing that is less a performance than a travesty.<br /><br />The reader may notice I mention none of the other performers. This is done mostly to protect the innocent. They do well enough, but their quality is still leagues from the 1982 version. As in nearly everything that went wrong with this Sweeney, I blame the director.<br /><br />Somebody must have told Burton that Sweeney Todd is a dark comedy. He seems to have forgotten about the \\"comedy\\" and concentrated on the \\"dark\\" - to great excess, alas. Practically everything is filmed through blue filters - which may have been considered clever technique 50years ago but is now just a strain on the eyes.<br /><br />On first viewing the film, and assuming you know the score, the first thing you will notice is the complete absence of the chorus. Considering the deep relationship between Sweeney and Greek theater, this omission is akin to dropping the witches from Macbeth. It is this omission that robs the work of its dimensionality and causes the ending to fall flatter than last week's souffl&eacute;.<br /><br />Aside from the directorial murder of the chorus and its music, this performance contains a number of omissions, truncations, and abbreviations. The flagellation scene, as I recall, is gone. The Todd-Pirelli contest contains only the shaving part, not the tooth-pulling half. (This omission is fairly common in performance, alas). The Beggar Woman's part is excised by about 50%, including most of the best bits. The \\"God, That's Good\\" number is foreshortened to the point of being seen on edge. The wildly funny lead up to Beadle Bamford's murder is gone. And so on and on. Somebody should remind Burton that this is a recipe for hash, not honest roast beef.<br /><br />Burton's directorial aim seems clearly to rob Sweeney of almost every ounce of its considerable humor. He fails, and there's enough left to cause us to go into deep mourning for the rest. \\"Hello, my name is Tim. I'm here to make sure you don't have any fun.\\" He seems to desire the players to be a funereal in their acting as possible.<br /><br />As a result, a great actor like Johnny Depp is converted into somebody you'd never want to see or hear again. Depp, clearly too young for the role, is made up to look like somebody in a 1930s horror flick instead of someone who's spent nearly 2 decades in the penal sloughs of Old Australia. He plays Sweeney as if the man were loopy, which he isn't. He has a detached, dreamy delivery and never, NEVER catches fire. I suppose this approach may be considered interesting in a sort of abstract way, but mainly it's boringand tedious. Despite all the cuts, the film is only about a quarter-hour shorter than the 1982 and 2001 versions ... yet it seems to drag out a lot longer. You do the math.<br /><br />Perhaps the weakest link in the whole cast is Helena Bonham Carter, who is manifestly too young to play Mrs. Lovett. Her makeup may be intended to age her, but merely gives her a tired and haggard appearance. Lovett's first appearance should wrench the viewer's attention onto her relentlessly. Bonham Carter's first appearance gives us time to see if there are any pictures on the ceiling. The less said about \\"Have a Little Priest\\", probably the better. There are a few clever moments, but only in the sense of a convergence of a visual clue to the lyrics ... a technique that doesn't hold up well with repetition. Bonham Carter's motherly effusions over Toby wouldn't convince a 3-month-old puppy.<br /><br />Speaking of puppies, the staging of this dog omits the original wonderful mechanistic set in favor of a more realistic presentation of London. This can be understood, since films generally try to transcend the limitations of the stage. In this case, however, the relationship of staging with plot is too organic to be so lightly dismissed.<br /><br />Look, guys ... if you buy this you'll regret it ... maybe not now, but later and for the rest of your life. (Thanks, Rick.) Try the Lansbury.
B0015DYIH2|1.0|I devoured the first three books in this series, and was competely in love with \\"Twilight.\\"  I cannot believe what an awful end this book was.  The more I read, the more disgusted with Meyer I became.  She depicts birth as a gory, bone-snapping affair, and is way too specific for my tastes.  Then she does not give Bella any mothering/nurturing characteristics at all.  Not to mention the book is not well-written, the overall story line is stagnant, and Meyer contradicts herself repeatedly.  I won't say \\"don't waste your time\\" because addicts like me will (of course) read this book.  But don't be disappointed- just know going in to it that you will have an ending to Bella and Edward's story, but it is AWFUL!!!
B000002UVX|4.0|Some of the best Hendrix from the \\"Band of Gypsys\\" era. This is my favorite band highlighting Buddy Miles and his drive and power. Power Trios are so rare and Jimi's formations are a classic study of this, rarely well executed, musical grouping. All the songs are Hendrix classics.

B000MG1ZG0|4.0|This is probably the weakest Doors album (and I include the non Jom Morrison album \\"Other Voices\\" in the mix but not 1972's \\"Full Circle\\").<br />With all the new bonus material, it will be a seller as always.<br />I honestly for one would rather listen to the Doors 1971 \\"Other Voices\\" than this album, but let the rock and roll crowd just marvel over Jim Morrsion as if he was some great artist and listen to this album, which is ok, but not one of their best.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I didn't want this book to end.  It not only was a great mystery, it was so well written on the characters that I cared about all of them and the intrincies of relationships built on each other and was real life.  It wasn't boring in the getting to know the characters as some books are when they are laying a foundation.  The twists and turns of the mysteries was the best, and I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good read, suspense, as well as interesting multi faceted people.  Can't wait to start his second book that follows this one.<br /><br />As note I found this accidentally by reading other reviews on the Kindle's recommended reads.  I appreciate reading reviews and look for the 4-1/2 and 5 stars and then I'll get a sample and buy if it is good.  I didn't even wait until the end of sample to buy this one and I was not disappointed at all.<br /><br />The only negative about a Kindle is that I can't share the book with others, and I would be giving this book to everyone.  I have however, recommended it to multiple Kindle users as well as my book reading friends.
0312370849|4.0|This is a very sad book.  The first half starts off strong but the second half looses momentum.  I enjoyed it, but compared to other holocaust novels, this one fell short in a few places.  However, I am still glad I read it.
0345495004|3.0|I just finished reading Loving Frank. I was surprised that it has become such a hot book to read, especially among book clubs. I imagine that it is due to the fact that it is historical fiction with romance, scandal, and even murder...such excitement! New author, Horan may have just gotten a lucky break by picking a person/topic that has elements that in today's society are appealing if not celebrated.  But honestly, I think the book was just \\"ok\\", not any literary masterpiece here. (Confusing at times, characters lacked depth, motive, it needed more reworking in places, even though the auther rewrote it after she claimed the first attempt was no good.) But what also made it hard to read, and I suppose even to write, was the fact that most books have some main character that you want to like, and are cheering for... you want to see their \\"transformation\\". Both Maymah and Frank were not lovable, rather, so disturbingly egocentric that it was hard for me to even read the book. I felt myself becoming angry while reading it, and didn't care for them or their story. No transformation,they just became more pathetic. However, because Frank became a such famous figure, and because of the fact that it was for my book club, I kept reading...but inside I felt these megalomanics didn't even deserve my time reading about them.  I recently read another book by a new author, which was infinately better written.  Also historical fiction with the same elements...romance, murder, what a book!  Everyone that I tell to read it falls in love...The Tea Rose, by Jennifer Donnelly.  This auther has a true gift.  I cannot wait to read more books that she will write.
0060005696|4.0|Excellent book..I wish I still had it...will get it again..there seemed to be something missing from this book though..can't put my finger on it but it might be \\"an answer\\" that's missing..a real answer to the problems of choice it talks about.. a guideline.  I suppose if I re-read it I could analyze it on a second read this time to work out my solutions in my own workbook, using some of the suggestions.  For me, a person who can't make decisions still (been trying about 20 yrs now), the book makes me think someone ALMOST understands me.  It goes right up to the edge but doesn't jump.  I would like to see a part 2 with some prayer behind it or a workbook bundled with it.
068484267X|4.0|A sad yet humorous memoir of Irish childhood... Frank McCourt gives a no-holds-barred account of growing up in a family riddled with domestic tragedy - dead siblings, poverty, drunkard good-for-nothing father who drinks his dole money while his children starve, desperate and helpless mother, less-than-sympathetic aunt and grandma - amid tyrannical schoolmasters and the ever-oppressive Catholic priests in the background.     But to pare the cast that informs McCourt's growing years down simplistically to stock-characters  is to do injustice to the at-times dual nature evident in the true-to-life personalities one encounters in real life.      The following lines reveals his contradictory feelings he has about his father, which also provides a glimpse of the heartbreakingly innocent perspective McCourt employs in his narrative:  'I think my father is like the Holy Trinity with three people in him, the one in the morning with the paper, the one at night with the stories and the prayers, and then the one who does the bad thing and comes home with the smell of whiskey and wants us to die for Ireland.'    Rough-hewn honesty that will touch the most-hard-hearted and cynical among us.
0307588335|5.0|As a former Lehman employee who left years ago, I found this book entertaining and enlightening. The seeds of Lehman's fall were sewn years ago and I enjoyed reading about the same cast of clowns that were there when I worked for Lehman. This book is an enjoyable first-hand look at what happened from an insider. Well done Mr. McDonald.
B001993Y2C|5.0|I just received the set and the packaging is not as bad as everyone says.  I pulled up the top, removed the first season set, put in the first disc and it was not the chore that most of the reviews would have you believe.  For one thing, I have been watching DVDs of one type or another for 8 years and the only ones that had a problem playing back had a gouge or crack that was significant (they were Netflix or some other rental company).  I didn't see any scratches on this set, but even if I did it would be no big deal.  Secondly, this series is amazing and Blu-Ray is the way to go if you have the equipment.   Five stars all the way: just buy this and enjoy the best that TV has had to offer.
B001GZ6QC4|4.0|First off, Heath Ledger fully deserved his posthumous Oscar for his over-the-top performance as The Joker. He was manic, intelligent and philosophical and vicious, often simultaneously. He provided the most frightening of villains - the one motivated not by greed or power, but the sheer thrill of introducing chaos into civil society. This made him the ultimate criminal -- one thoroughly unlike the rest of us, and therefore more frightening.<br /><br />There were plenty of fireworks and thrills in the movie, and plenty of chases and explosions. But \\"The Dark Knight\\" needed to plumb the depths a little more to make it as memorable overall as Ledger. Frank Miller's graphic novel of the same name addressed issues of a middle-aged hero trying to push his aging body to perform as it once had. It also pushed the moral limits of vigilantism to the breaking point. What kind of strange morality allows a hero to break bones, permanently maim and terrorize criminals to get his way, but will not let him kill? As it is Christian Bale's Batman suffers a few scratches and cuts. But never has to face the existential questions faced by the rest of us -- inevitable aging and the gradual diminution of strength and purpose.<br /><br />\\"The Dark Knight:\\" would have been a more fully-realized movie had it tackled these question, but it was satisfying nonetheless. Great makeup/CGI work to provide us with a believable Two-Face. And the film did not allow its not inconsiderable pyrotechnics and special effects get in the way of the story.<br /><br />RIP, Heath -- you were awesome.

B00006CXSS|5.0|HBO's  true tale of Band of Brothers reveals the lives of men, brought together by the ugliness of war.  Friendships, failings, weaknesses, tears, and horrors aren't glorified. They're shown as is, to where I hated some characters for their weaknesses, hated others for their over done heroics and thirst for power and glory, and felt for the men that were just that, men that were human and performing the greatest glory of all, a service to their country. The cut-ins at the begining of each disc from the original men that this story revolves around and the pain and humor that still affects them after 60+ years, is touching and reveals a depth that will soon be lost to the younger generation.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of WWII movies and Band of Brothers is a cinematic beauty in both filming and history that bears watching again and again.
B000MRAAJM|4.0|I loved the series when it first came out on TV in the US on the Discovery Channel. AMAZING! It's hands down the best nature show ever. EVER! And that was in standard definition. On Blu-ray, it's so much better!    Anyway, I would have given it 5 stars, but this version available on Amazon.com is the original BBC version narrated by David Attenborough. I prefer the Discovery Channel version narrated by Sigourney Weaver. The main feature of each version is identical, except for the narration. If you watched this on the Discovery Channel in the US and liked Sigourney Weaver's narration, you should consider passing on this one and getting the Discovery Channel version instead. Unfortunately, for whatever reason, Amazon.com doesn't carry the Discovery Channel version. Amazon.com should carry both versions on Blu-ray. Or better yet, the makers should take advantage of existing DVD technology and have both versions on the same DVD, with the viewer able to change the narrator via the DVD's audio preferences menu.    BTW, the Discovery Channel/Sigourney Weaver version on Blu-ray includes behind the scenes footage (which the original BBC/David Attenborough version on Blu-ray on Amazon.com apparently doesn't have). I don't know if it's all the extra content that the standard DVDs have, but it has the following:    Features:  * 11 episodes and bonus materials  * A behind-the-scenes look at the equipment, technology and danger that went into the making of this incredible series
B000XG5J0M|5.0|This is the 1st Ken Follett novel I've read or listened to, but it won't be the last.  Ken Follett weaves a story of a world of early 1300's Britain where injustice and hypocrisy is rampant and often institutionalized.  Through the hearts and minds of 5 characters primarily - 2 of them qualifiably evil - we feel the weight of this medieval world's consequences in each of their trials and tribulations, and that is the great strengths of this epic novel.      It took about 1.5 cd's for me to get into the story - but by the time I put in cd #3 I was absolutely hooked.  John Lee adroitly re-tells the story using English accents for each of the characters which sound authentic.  Through his re-telling, I felt the urgency of the merchants of Kingsbridge to have Godwyn elected as the Prior - and their surprise when the result wasn't what they expected.  I felt the anger and disbelief at the injustice Gwenda had to suffer at the hands of her Father and Sir Ralph Fitzgerald.  I felt the resentment Murthin had toward his master - Elfrik - with whom he was completing an apprenticeship to become a great carpenter.  I felt the frustration of the merchants when the Priory asserted its will over the townspeople so that the monks could enrich themselves over the short term at the expense of the town's long-term success.    I felt the incredulity of the triumph of superstition and how monks used it to keep the townspeople of Kingsbridge within their grip.  That is just the tip of the iceberg - and only the 1st half of the book.    The 2nd half shakes up the 1st half of the book - which could be accurately described as the way thing were - and outlines how each of the aforementioned characters overcomes their individual hardships as a result of that fact - with some exceptions.  The plague hits with a vengeance, and through the turmoil we watch through the minds eye as change happens in all of the old institutions.  I don't want to give any more away, accept to say that by the time Ireached the end of disk #36, I was thoroughly satisfied:)    I found myself drawn to these characters and to the detailed view of the backdrop of period of time the book was written about.  The book on a historical level brought to light the injustices that Serfs had to live with, the hardship of women who wanted to advance beyond the life of serving husbands and raising children, the subjective treatment of the \\"merchant\\" class and the self-indulgent and irresponsible nobility and a similarly corrupt clergy, and the ultimate triumph of a new order with the help of one of the most terrible disasters in our history - the bubonic plague.    Don't let the length put you off as this is fast and easy reading for all adults - just be aware that there is some \\"mature\\" content within, as Mr. Follett puts the authenticity of his characters and his world as top priority, and he achieves that with amazing results.    This is a must read - I would say - for anyone with even a remote interest in the medieval period or those who just enjoy a good epic novel you can really sink your teeth into.  In book format or on CD, I would put this one in my top 10 all time favorites.  5 stars easily!
1594488916|5.0|Collectors are my business. My clients aren't book collectors, but the objects aren't important, it's the common thread of collecting and the level of interest/passion involved. In my work I have had customers who enjoyed their hobby but kept it in perspective. They didn't let it negatively affect the rest of their lives, but I've also had clients that consumed macaroni and cheese all month long so they could afford a particular treasure. One pair of clients (they collected together) phoned on the way to the airport leaving for their honeymoon. The gift money they'd just received would pay for a treasure they'd been eyeing. For some people collecting is their life, and the rarer the treasures they possess, in their mind, defines how important and special they are. As passion for the hobby grew so did the crimes at shows I'd attend. Theft became common and more and more security guards were hired to inspect packages and watch the entrances and exits.<br /><br />This book is a compelling narrative of the world of collecting and the passionate individuals who reside in it. It illustrates how the line between desperately wanting something can evolve into theft because the need and distorted importance of the collection overshadows right and wrong. It is a true crime, cat and mouse game where the end result, as is often the case in the real world, doesn't neatly resolve everything.<br /><br />Whether the reader is a collector or has never for a moment cared about searching for old treasures, the book does what good books should always do -- permit immersion into another's world. The book does this beautifully and makes this the perfect gift for a sick friend, an avid reader, a book lover or a collector.

0061124958|5.0|As part of my campaign to get the little darlings to read something decent, I got a spanking new copy of Charlotte's Web and was pleased to discover that kids will read old books as long as they look new.  There's a reason why this book is called a classic, and if you don't have a tear in your eye after you learn what happens to Wilbur and Charlotte at the end, well you're a scary person.  Great illustrations by Garth Williams by the way!

B0012QE4Q2|5.0|If you're either a history buff or a fan of any actor in this movie, you'll enjoy it. Natalie Portman, Scarlet Johansson and Eric Bana did very good British accents. SPOILER WARNING!!! The scene where Anne is executed is emotionally powerful. SPOILER OVER!!! I just love period movies, so this one was a good bet to watch, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The movie was unfairly given a PG-13 rating (in my opinion). Shame that the line \\"We are sisters, and therefore born to be rivals\\" was deleted from the film. Double shame that Ruby Films, which co-produced this movie, pulled out of financing a film version of \\"King Lear\\" that was to star Sir Anthony Hopkins, Kiera Knightley, Gwyneth Paltrow and Naomi Watts. Now, all we have to look forward to is Al \\"Say Hello To My Little Friend\\" Pacino as Shakespeare's tortured monarch. I highly recommend this wonderful movie.
B0006A9GLI|5.0|I didn't what to get my boyfriend, and although the album was expensive, I bought it for him as he's a HUGE fan.  I knew he had a few of their albums on vinyl but I chose Rearview Mirror since it was all of their hits.  It was brand new in original packaging and shipped quickly.

B001DZDTR2|5.0|KISS' Destroyer was, at the time of its release, the most experimental album that the band had put out.  It was also the first certified platinum album for the group.  Thirty-plus years later, the album is still regarded as one of the band's greatest efforts.  Why?  For the simple fact that this album not only appealled to hardcore KISS fans, it reached out to the mainstream as well.<br /><br />One could argue that this album is more like a mini greatest hits package than just KISS' fourth major label release.  A number of their greatest tracks are included here.  The first track, \\"Detroit Rock City\\" is my favorite KISS tune.  It's a blistering rocker that showcases Gene Simmons' bass.  Another thundering tune is \\"God Of Thunder.\\"  \\"Beth\\" shows the softer side of the group, and it became one of their greatest hits.  \\"Do You Love Me\\" takes the listener on a wild ride with the ladies that love KISS.  \\"Great Expectations\\" shows KISS experimenting heavily with their sound (and it works here).  The anthemic rocker \\"Shout It Out Loud\\" will have you pumping your fists into the air.  \\"King of the Night Time World,\\" \\" \\"Flaming Youth,\\" and \\"Sweet Pain.\\" round out the collection.<br /><br />To top it all off, \\"Destroyer\\" has what many consider to be one of the greatest album covers ever.<br /><br />If you consider yourself a KISS fan and do not own \\"Destroyer,\\" then you aren't a true KISS fan.  If you've never heard KISS before or only know them from their later work or the many greatest hits packages released over the years, trust me when I tell you that \\"Destroyer\\" is THE album to own by KISS.  Highly recommended.
B000OPOAM0|5.0|The Terminator is a well-known franchise that has action and science fiction combined into a blender. The first is a great start in the franchise. Directed by James Cameron who also directed the highest-grossing film of all time, Titanic and co-wrote Rambo: First Blood part II alongside Sylvester Stallone. Let's begin the review. The film begins in 2029 when terminator cyborgs created by a super computer Skynet took over Earth and unleashed nuclear warheads on the world and killed 3/5 of the human population. The survivors and Skynet engage into a world war to settle the deed to Earth. The leader of the resistance being John Connor. Skynet sends a disguised Terminator (Arnold Schwarznegger) to 1984 to assassinate John's mother Sarah (Linda Hamilton) so that John would cease to exist and give Skynet an advantage. John discovers this and sends another resistance fighter Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to protect Sarah. Kyle tells Sarah about Judgment Day and the future war between humanity and Skynet. The Terminator tries to look for which woman with the name Sarah Connor to kill, but doesn't know the target's middle name, so he resorts to killing every one of them just in case. He eventually found the right one with Kyle and begins a battle that would continue throughout the rest of the film. Kyle and Sarah conceive the future John during their only night together at a motel.  In the final showdown at the factory, Kyle sacrifices himself to put the Terminator at a legless disadvantage. Sarah crushes the living daylights out of the Terminator in the end. Some time later, it shows the now-pregnant Sarah traveling to a new town. The visual effects were so real, the acting was well-done, and the storyline is so convincing you would want to see it. There are so far three sequels that eventually followed. Judgment Day is a possible candidate for best sequel (like Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, and The Dark Knight, for example), and best film in the action/science fiction genre. Rise of the Machines was where the series went downhill when James Cameron dropped out. I have not seen Salvation yet. I would recommend getting the first two for your collection, but unless you are a true fan of the series, please avoid the mediocre third.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|I am an unabashed Michael Jackson fan and am STILL struggling to process the fact that he is no longer of this earth.  That being said, Michael will forever be OUT OF THIS WORLD!  This concert (partially lip-synched or not) is FANTASTIC.  To revel in Michael's total performance is the payoff.  This totally (IMMACULATELY) choreographed Michael-fest is so worth it! Dancing/singing/lip-synching / ALL of what takes place on this video smorgasbord is a wonder to behold. Other reviewers comment on the lip-synching.  But, considering all the other performing that he is doing over the course of TWO HOURS, Michael was smart enough to know that the singing would suffer--so he wisely (and sparingly) integrated some lip-synching to HIS OWN VOICE.  I say this simply reaffirms the genius in him and his commitment to giving his fans the ultimate in entertainment.  The playlist for this concert is a retrospective of his greatest hits performed with creative aplomb.  Perhaps some of the editing could have been done differently; but it does not at all detract from the Great One's all-out performance.  The DVD is one that will serve as a visual memorial to the world's greatest entertainer.  I say: by all means GET THIS ONE.
B00064ADR0|5.0|I already had the LP, the CD and now the remastered CD, with the RAH concert.   This review is about the RAH concert. In short: it's absolutely stunning!  There's so much energy in this live set, it's really amazing. Also the sound quality is very good; IMHO even better than the 2009 issue of the Woodstock recording.  From the beginning to the end, Johnny plays with lots of drive and energy.  Listen to Johnny B. Goode, and you know what I mean: switching from lead to rhythm guitar in a split second and a lot of \\"breaks\\" which made JW famous later in his career. Also the collaboration with Edgar is great; that brings a bit of jazzy atmosphere in the songs where he's joining in.  Together with the 1969 Woodstock set, this 1970 Royal Albert Hall recording catches Johnny on the peak of his \\"pre-rock\\" period.
0316044695|5.0|An amazing book about a true American hero.  If this was a fiction novel, you'd be marveling at how impossible it would be to do and accomplish the things that author Marcus Luttrell does.  It moved me to tears, had me waking up my husband to read parts of it to him, got me so angry, and then had me in tears again.  Even my husband, who hates reading, read this book and has passed it on many times over. Absolutely amazing, highly recommended!

B000EHSVOG|4.0|Producer Irwin Allen's follow up to his blockbuster The Poseidon Adventure (1972), reaps the benefits of his previous success, as backed by two major studios (Warner Brothers and 20th Century Fox), with a bigger budget, and a fantastic cast loaded with big name stars, The Towering Inferno (1974), showcases destruction on a grander scale and a broader canvas, as a fire breaks out in the world's tallest building.  Directed by John Guillerman, with Irwin Allen handling the action scenes, the epic was filmed and delivered to theaters in an amazing seven months, and would win several academy awards, including one for best cinematography.  The screenplay is by Sterling Silliphant, who also worked on Poseidon, and won an Oscar winner for his screenplay for In the Heat of the Night.<br /><br />The film follows the events on the day of the dedication of San Francisco's Glass Tower, and the progression of the fire that destroys it.  With a multitude of characters, and dangerous situations continually springing up, the action rarely lets up, as the city's Fire Department attempts to save those trapped in the 138 floor structure.  With Steve McQueen as the fire chief, and Paul Newman as the project architect, Inferno teams two of the biggest stars of the day, who despite the overpowering presence of the raging fire, still manage to carry the film together.<br /><br />With a background in science fiction and fantasy, Allen was not one to let reality get in the way of generating onscreen excitement.  In The Poseidon Adventure, bending reality was not a big issue, as the whole situation of an overturned ship was quite mind-boggling, but here dealing with just a super tall building, reality is a more relevant consideration.  It may look cool when all the building lights come on in sequence, but that is not how buildings are wired.  Using the breeches buoy to evacuate the survivors between buildings is a pure fantasy construct to feature people dangling hundreds of feet in the air.  The fire is out of control, yet somehow the lights and electrical power remain in service.  Helicopters can't land on the roof because of the wind, but a chopper is used to save the passengers in the elevator.  The film is entertaining if you go along for the ride, but looking with even a slightly critical eye, there's a lot that happens, big and small, that isn't plausible.<br /><br />Although flawed, The Towering Inferno is one of Irwin Allen's triumphs as a filmmaker.  He was certainly proud of the movie, and finding a way to work a deluge into the story, and featuring an array of bodies falling from great heights, must have added to Allen's satisfaction.  Credit is due for what was accomplished at the time, in the areas of special effects, action sequences, and working with real fire.<br /><br />The two disc special edition is loaded with extras.  With many of the principals involved in the film now deceased, a commentary track by film historian F.X. Feeney is provided.  He helps provide some historical context, as well as behind the scenes information.  Disc Two has numerous extras and assorted featurettes, which include comments from cast members and the production crew.  Contrary to expectations, Newman and McQueen apparently got on very well together.  Other extras include AMC's Backstory for The Towering Inferno, deleted scenes, miniature replicas of lobby cards, and a booklet with extensive notes and cast photos.  It is the extras elevate the package to the four star level.re is out of control, yet somehow the lights and electrical power remain in service.

B000VSAEYI|4.0|I clean out this pool every few days because we don't want to breed mosquitoes and the bottom gets slippery. But it was way too difficult to clean under the slide (got TOTALLY gross under there) so i just cut out the slide and then cut off the buttresses and now it's an air mattress, which works out great. There's also more space in there to play and toys don't get stuck underneath. Still completely worth the money to me. We've had a fantastic time with it almost every day.

And maybe even drew me in more than the Twilight Saga. I read all the books in a week and am SO sad it's over and I have to wait until November when the next one comes out. I love this series and I hope there are 10 more books to come :) This is such a new spin on Vampires and the writing is so realistic. Thank you!!!!!
B0029XZODY|5.0|After the climaxes that ended Season Two, Dexter's impending marriage and child, you could be excused for believing Dexter would turn over a new leaf.  Having narrowly missed being caught in Season Two you would assume Dexter would change his ways, but right from the start of the first episode it's clear that isn't going to happen.  Dexter's first kill also sets in motion the events of Season Three.  But rather than killing based on his code, Dexter accidentally kills in self-defense.  The killing draws in powerful Assistant District Attorney Miguel Prado (Jimmy Smits) and his volatile deputy sheriff brother Ramon (played to intense perfection by Jason Manuel Olazabal).  As with seasons one and two plot twists abound against the backdrop of Dexter's impending nuptials.  Pressure mounts for Dexter to give up his freedom and his apartment.  He's now questioning the wisdom of the code his father Harry taught him.  Are his days of vengeance coming to an end?<br /><br />As with previous seasons the other cast members are more fully flushed out including a budding romance for Detective Batista (played with great warmth and honesty by David Zayas).  Dexter's sister Deb (the superbly foul-mouthed Jennifer Carpenter, Michael C. Hall's real life wife) is drawn to a confidential informant who may help her earn her detective's shield or blow her chances for it.  At the same time there's complications with Deb's partner Detective Quinn and an Internal Affairs agent Yuki Amado who needs Deb's help investigating Quinn.  A new serial killer, the Skinner, emerges to distract the detectives.  In a change from seasons one and two the focus shifts to the rest of this wonderful ensemble cast and away from a heavy emphasis on Dexter.

0393324818|5.0|It's pretty amazing, when you think about it, just how much time and money and energy and brain power have been invested in professional sports over the past hundred years or so, and none more than major-league baseball. Tracking and evaluating individual and team statistics has become an entire industry, and it's an established enough industry that it can support heated debates about methodology and best practices. Moneyball is a fascinating peek into that world. It examines some of the arguments and grudges that have sprung up over the years among analysts and baseball insiders, and it somehow manages to do it in a way that will pique the interest of even non-baseball fans.<br /><br />In 2002, the Oakland Athletics had the second lowest payroll in baseball, yet they managed to acquire more wins than all but one other team. According to conventional baseball wisdom, this was an impossible feat. So how did they do it? Michael Lewis answers this question by telling the story of A's general manager Billy Beane.<br /><br />Beane, drawing on very unconventional analysis by a baseball scholar named Bill James, believed that winning games depended far less than commonly believed on things like hitters' batting average and fielders' number of errors and relief pitchers' saves. Instead, the most telling indicators of success were things like a batter's ability to get on base with or without a hit and a pitcher's strikeout percentage. Through the course of the 2002 season, Beane's scrappy team won game after game while acquiring players everyone else thought were worthless and emphasizing strategies most other teams scoffed at. It seemed Beane was being proven right.<br /><br />Of course, not everyone agreed. The 2002 A's were an anomaly, some argued. But the numbers speak for themselves. Even readers with little or no interest in baseball will be intrigued by Lewis's ability to describe and analyze statistical trends. Billy Bean comes off looking like a heroic David fighting against the Goliath of major-league baseball's institutions. Traditional baseball scouts and others who hold fast to supposedly time-tested \\"truths\\" about America's favorite game come across as naïve at best and downright foolish at worst. Through it all, the background stories of players--some whom no one but the most ardent baseball fans have ever heard of--add a delightful element of human interest, and the team's ultimate success gives the book an almost epic hero's-journey feel.<br /><br />One word of caution: baseball is a dangerous sport to become interested in. With 162 games per season, not including the playoffs, loyally following even one team is a time-consuming enterprise. If you're a baseball fan already, Moneyball will make you watch and think about games differently. If you're not a fan, reading this book just might make you one.major-league baseball's institutions.

B0013POLS8|3.0|It's a concert that I would only watch once.  Her voice does crack here and there.  I do agree with others, there was a lot of shots of the fans, to the point where it was starting to get irritating.  Concert was not entertaining like other blu ray concerts I have watch, Hit Man, Andrea Bocelli, where they have every instrument you think of playing live.  On a positive note, she does sing many of her great hits.
B002HFJ77S|5.0|This story hooked me from the very first page......I literally could not put my Kindle down until I knew what happens to Sadie, Ed and all the other people.   After finishing the story, I had a new respect for elderly people.....it's not what is on the outside but what is on the inside.....thank you Sophie for a great story!
0545123267|5.0|I enjoyed this book so much it tells a story of Grace and Sam , about what they must overcome to be together its just great and theres more to the book!<br />I was so crying made me sad i cant wait for the next book in the series! To see what happens next great read.
B002JM1VJG|3.0|Hello People...  If you want to review the single for \\"celebration\\" then go to the SINGLE...  As far as the DVD goes... how did you all get a copy to review so early??? I mean you really must be some \\"power people\\" in order for Madonna or her label to send you a copy over a month and a half before it's release...  I especially love the guy who actually listed the track listings for both disc 1 and disc 2... OTFLMAO!!!!  I especially love the disclaimer he added about the track listing being subject to change...  must be really boring out there in Colorado... really makes me trust anything else he has to say about other products on here... guess you're psychic buddy.  GET A LIFE FOLKS!   Oh yeah... I gave the DVD 5 stars only so I am able to post this comment (and of course it's Madonna we're talking about)... will do a real review when it's released!     LOWERED TO 3 STARS...    Since owning it and viewing it I have to agree with additional posts here that now own and reviewed this DVD...     4 Stars for content - A lot of repeat content that you most likely already own if you have Immaculate Collection DVD and 93 thru 99 DVD.  Would have made all the difference if everything was hgh quality / remastered.   2 Stars for quality - Not remastered and not able to be viewed properly on wide screen television due to aspect/ratio.  Pretty lame.    1 Star because they still left content out...  (American Life, etc)    An average rating of 3 stars awarded...    Guess it's because it was the last album, etc. left for Madonna to do with WB so not much was put into it except for the cover art, but even that was a retro photograph that was retouched.  Hopefully a better effort will be made with Live Nation...
B001N26GFM|4.0|Without describing the story ( everyone else has already done that well ),  a few thoughts. A most unique perspective seeing the evolution of the  characters, such as Bruno's mother and sister. A bit slow at times.  BUT the ending was a shock. Sometimes we become a bit numb to the atrocities  committed by Germany during the war, this was a different type of awakening.  Movies like this remind us never to forget.
0385341008|5.0|I drive quite a ways to work and home each day. So I got the book on CD.  What a experience.  Each person has their own voice.  Fell in love with everyone.  I would go from happy to mad to sad all in a 30 minute period!  GREAT GREAT BOOK!
B001GCUER0|5.0|[[ASIN:B001GCUER0 Mad Men: Season 2]]<br /><br />I'd missed some episodes when they originally ran, so I'm now caught up.<br />There are extras with comments of each episode that help clarify the storyline if you happen to miss the point or weren't sure of a certain situations.  You also get the actors take on what's going on.<br />Very well written show and great acting!
B00139W3NE|4.0|I was at home, very ill, and watching TV. Something I rarely do. I had no expectations of the film, but it sounded better than anything else that was on offer. As it happened, it was the best film I've seen in years. I've now watched it again several times, and never get bored of it. I love the look and feel of the film, the acting performances, the atmosphere, and best of all, Iorek the Armored Bear. I am astonished that other reviewers have found it boring.     Since watching the film, I have read the original books and I agree that the books are better. But then books usually are. Also, filmmakers tend to pander to audience expecations about good guys and bad guys, whereas the lines between good and evil are much fuzzier in the books. Having said that, I still love the film. I don't see the need to compare it with the Harry Potter or Narnia movies, but if I did, the comparison would be in favour of The Golden Compass.    Looking forward to the next one (please).
B000001DYA|4.0|Having seen the documentary \\"Metal: A headbanger's journey\\" some years back and finding a cover of pop song in the 60s to be my idea of a true heavy metal song, I bought this album (and Vanilla Fudge's debut) on the chance that it did have the song featured in the documentary. Not sure that I have found the song I heard. Should have made a note of the song when I saw the movie! Anyway, since exploring the origins of heavy metal for myself, I suppose that it's easier to convince myself that this was the first heavy metal album. More so than for Led Zeppelin's and Black Sabbath's debut albums. What I found most interesting about this album is how -it seems to me- that Blue Cheer were inspired by Jimi Hendrix's guitar playing. This album is infused with blues based rock of the kind that Hendrix played. The songs on this album are often heavy, with fuzzy guitar, and at times the male lead singer sounds like the male version of Janis Joplin (I don't know which one of those two started performing first though).<br /><br />  Anyway, here are my picks as the best songs on the album, plus the rest:<br /><br />Second time around - I like the drums in this track, from the cool intro, to the extended solo later on. The riff is really cool too...though it does sound familiar...not sure...maybe Blue Cheer were the first with something like this? Lyrics feature the phrase \\"You better straighten up child. You better fly right\\". I know of that phrase from the annoying Stephen Sondheim song (I think) \\"Straighten up and fly right\\". Might be an old fashioned common phrase in any case. The end of the song has some distorted guitar sounds. From an Australian perspective, I think that this is the kind of song that a Jet or a Spiderbait could do a good cover of, not that this original is lacking in any way. Be good for someone to put this song out there again.<br /><br />Out of focus - I liked this song first time around, but more so on a second listen. The lead guitar and bass guitar are funky and nicely play together. The lead guitar also reminds me of Jimi Hendrix. The lyrics seem to deal with a lack of self esteem.<br /><br />The rest:<br /><br />Summertime blues - this MIGHT be the song that I heard on that documentary. If it is, then the cd doesn't capture the effect of hearing this in the cinema, which made it seem like a true heavy metal song, way before any band got labelled that as such. Has a fuzzy, throbbing heavy metal guitar sound, influenced by Hendrix' \\"Foxey lady\\", I think. Features fills by the drum and bass guitar.<br /><br />Rock me baby: the lead guitar picks notes here and then the signature blues drum beat and bass guitar note sequence kicks in. Has some gravelly vocals. A cover of a B.B.King song, I think.<br /><br />Doctor please - has a Hendrix style lead guitar style and it predates Black Sabbath's heavy metal style riffing.<br /><br />Parchment farm - a cover of a traditional song, this one in particular being a version by Mose Allison. Ity's bassy with a long instrumental bit.<br /><br />  Blue Cheer is a band I never would have heard of unless I had decided to explore heavy metal. At the moment, I'd give them the kudos of bringing out the first album which was heavy metal to any great degree. It's the original compositions on this album which stand out the most...and I actually prefer them to any of the songs on the debuts of Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, which are two bands that often get credited with inventing heavy metal.play together.

0143034901|5.0|This is honestly the best book I remember reading.  While Khaled Hosseini (Kite Runner, A Thousand Splendid Suns) are great reads, and Paul Coehlo makes one think in obscure ways, I believe this author surpasses both.  The character development is outstanding and the intricately woven story line makes it impossible to put down.  It's been many years since I've read a book that captured my interest so much that I read into the late hours of the night.  I've already begun his most recent \\"Angel's Games\\" and am not disappointed.  I will be a fan for life. When is the next one???!!!
0312370849|5.0|I started reading this book yesterday afternoon and finished it by Midnight. I am a student of the Shoah and have read many many fiction and non-fiction books describing the tragedy of the European Jews during the second world war.    The book is beautifuly written and the alternating stories of Sarah's childhood horrors with the present day story of forty-five year old Julia is mesmerizing.  I am not going to discuss the plot -- many reviewers of this book have magnificantly already done so.    Sarah's Key grabbed a hold of me and the devastating story of the destruction of an innocent child and her family in a way that no other holocaust book has ever done.  I knew about the Velodrome d'Hiver from previous books -- but the horrific and sadistic action of the French police during the round-up of Jewish families on July 16, 1942 was new information.      France has a long and troubled history of Anti-Semtism; it seems to me that the French are split into two camps:  those who are openly Anti-Semetic and those who are covertly Anti-Semetic. However, I am not attempting to demonize the French -- the fact is that the entire world -- Europeans and the democratic allies did absolutely nothing to help the Jews before and during the war. Many European countries avidly assisted the Nazis and turned their Jews over to a certain and horrible death.  The United States State Department was openly Anti-Semetic during the 1930's and prevented legal immigration of German Jews who were desperately trying to escape from Hitler's rule.  So there is plenty of blame and shame to go around.      I now want to respond to the reviewers who hated this book.  What bothered you so much?  Was it the thought that a 10 year old child could bravely go through such horror and still try and help her lost brother?  Was it the fact that American Julia questioned her French husband's family and their actions during the war?  Was it the fact that the heinous actions of the French police and the general indifference of the French population hit too close to home?      I unreservedly recommend this book to anyone who has the heart and courage to share Sarah's journey.  Buy it!  Read it!  Share it with your friends and family!  But make sure you have a handkerchief nearby because, if you react as I did, you will be crying while you read.
0385341008|5.0|This is one of those special books that only comes around once in a great while. Simply a treasure. It took me to page 30 to get 'into' the story and understand what was going on and who was who, but after that, the story moved along beautifully. I learned many facts regarding German occupation during WWII which I had been unaware of so the book was informative as well as entertaining. You'll fall in love with the people from Guernsey just like I did.
0307454541|5.0|I haven't read a book that was such a page-turner in a really long time. It is utterly engrossing. Stieg Larsson is so good at painting distinct and interesting characters. Lisbeth Salander is an unlikely hero, but that's what makes her so engrossing to follow - she seems real and as far as female heroines go - a very empowering character. All the supporting characters are great too - plus the mystery is so interesting from start t finish. Definitely recommend this book!
B000LPS47U|5.0|Before horror movies did CGI, there was Re-Animator.  It has everything a good Friday night Horror flick could want.  It is in every Top 5 Zombie movie list for a good reason.  If you enjoyed Brain Dead (AKA Dead Alive), you'll really enjoy this.
B0019FOC5E|4.0|I must admit, I approached the movie, and the soundtrack, with some reservations. I knew that Meryl Streep could sing (she sings quite well, actually, in both \\"Postcards from the Edge\\" and \\"Prairie Home Companion\\"), but I love ABBA. The first time I watched the movie, I must admit I cringed a few times. Pierce Brosnan cannot be considered a great singer (or even, frankly, a good one), but he threw his heart into his songs, which makes up for a lot. You can't really sense that on the CD. The weakest singer is Stellan Skarsgard, probably, but as he usually speaks his lines in the songs, it isn't too bad. Colin Firth surprised me with both his singing and guitar playing in \\"Our Last Summer\\". Yes, he did both. The standout song is Amanda Seyfried and Dominic Cooper playing the young lovers singing \\"Lay All Your Love On Me\\". Both have very good voices. And Meryl singing \\"Slipping Through My Fingers\\" is poignant without being cloying, while her \\"The Winner Takes it All\\" is raw with repressed emotion.<br /><br />The thing is, the CD can't effectively present some of the songs. I'll buy it, because I now have the DVD and can imagine the songs from the movie while listening to the CD. I'm waiting for the full soundtrack, however! The movie grows on you, as you let go of your preconceptions from the bad reviews, or you just decide to enjoy it as a guilty pleasure.
B001F0VHEM|5.0|I usually love Pink, but this whole album is about the break up of her marriage it's a bummer to listen to. There's only 2 good songs on the whole thing. If you've just had a break up, you might like it, but it bummed me out.
B001GKJ2DO|4.0|I must admit, I had seen all the bad reviews, and had drawn back from watching this movie. I now know that THAT was a mistake! It may be a guilty pleasure, but I found this charming, with a wonderful sense of the use of the songs of ABBA that I've loved for years. Yes, it is a little over the top -- but when was the last time you watched \\"An American in Paris?\\" I re-watched it lately, and talk about over the top! But IT WORKS and is considered a classic. That's because the MUSIC works. The same could be said for \\"Mama Mia\\". Maybe not on the same level -- ABBA is not on par with Gershwin, after all -- but they never pretended to be, either.<br /><br />I knew Meryl Streep could sing (she does it very well in \\"A Prairie Home Companion\\" and \\"Postcards from the Edge\\"), but Colin Firth surprised me pleasantly. And could anything be funnier (or campier) than Christine Baranski's \\"Does Your Mother Know?\\" And I certainly cannot remember a more unique (or funnier) dance sequence than is in \\"Lay All Your Love On Me!\\"<br /><br />I'm well over 50, so I remember those clothes, those awful platform shoes, and how the music critics savaged ABBA as being \\"cotton candy\\" music. So ignore the critics. This movie will bring back some happy memories (if you are as old as I am!), and make some new ones!
B00004VWAF|5.0|After the release of Kind of Blue, Miles Davis was a legend.  Kind of Blue was such a huge innovation, he would have already been a legend, and his fans wanted more of Kind of Blue.  However, Miles Davis was not interested in living off of something that by now, had gone down in popularity.  Miles in the Sky was where he started using electric instruments, In a Silent Way was where he first did an album mixing jazz with rock, with Bitches Brew and A Tribute to Jack Johnson, he continued moving more into that direction.  As his older fans continued to be horrified, and some probably even burned their copies of Kind of Blue, he had now shown that this was where he was now.  Now, it wasn't a new attempt into a new direction, this was where he was.<br /><br />He did try new things with this album, and it was probably the one album that was the most disliked of all of his albums when it came out.  However, On the Corner is the most aggressive album, and it has probably the nicest groove.  This album is so different from the albums that he did in the fifties and during the early and mid-sixties, that you won't believe that it's by the same person who released Miles Smiles just seven years earlier.  It was also pretty different from his more recent albums.  This album was the final album that he actually recorded for Columbia records, and I although I can't say that he saved the best for last, I can say that he had gone through several different directions, and this was a great farewell from Columbia records.
0066620996|5.0|very informative book, outlines in sequential order the actions that need to take place to eleveate you to the next level.  i've applied many of the ideas or thoughts to my positions and have had great success.  highly recommended.
B00000J7SS|5.0|It's not as long as any of his Complete Sessions albums.  However, it's still pretty long.  I don't think Davis released any other albums in his life that were double albums.  However, this album is a great album.  It's probably his most psychedelic album, but In A Silent Way is also pretty psychedelic, but that one is a little bit more mellow.  Some fans might have complained that he was going commercial to appeal to a younger audience, other fans may have not thought in that way but been upset that he wasn't doing anything like what he did on Kind of Blue.  However, the true fans realized that he was doing something completely different from anything he had done before.<br /><br />This album is simply jam sessions, not to structured tunes, but free improvisation mixed and edited together.  The result is one of the wildest albums ever done.  Miles Davis was a genius, and this album is evidence of that.  Also, I have to mention all of the musicians that he had.  Miles Davis being Miles Davis has always been able to get the best musicians.  Paul Chambers, John Coltrane, Bill Evans, and for this album Chick Corea and John McLaughlin have all had the privilege of playing with Miles Davis.<br /><br />This album showed him moving into a direction that showed him going beyond Kind of Blue and 'Round About Midnight.
B0026OE2NY|3.0|Visually stunning, but... did anyone else notice that, according to this film, the concept of \\"cities\\" came about only 600 years ago? Hmmm. Also, last time I checked, the Grand Canyon is in Arizona, not in Colorado, as Ms. Close would like us to believe. The film lost credibility for me with those 2 doozies, so I was unable to feel confident in the accuracy of the rest of the facts.
068484267X|5.0|If I were sitting on the Pulitzer Prize committee today deciding who gets it, this book would win hands down and I'm glad it did.In honor of Frank McCourts' passing just a few weeks ago I decided to give his book a try.I remember all the hoopla when it came out thirteen years ago but I'm not one for hoopla.It sat on my shelf for years but I just never got to it.I'm glad that I finally did.Written in a beautiful,clear and distinctly Irish manner it was a delight to read.Chapter after chapter of abject poverty,hunger,filth,disease,alcoholism death and the human struggle of class are all presented in a way that's real and hard to imagine happening,but it did.If what McCourt writes is true and we have no reason to doubt him, the mere fact that he made it to where he did is a miracle and an example of fortitude we can all learn from.The fight for life despite horrible living conditions and the manner in which both his frustration and hopefullness as well as his growing intelligence helping him survive were conveyed in a palpable and at times very funny narrative.After reading this book which in my opinion is destined to be considered a true classic work,it will I'm sure, leave an indelible imprint on your brain that will remain there for a while.Just because it took me thirteen years to read it doesn't mean you have to. Read it now so you too can see the beauty of what a little hard boiled egg and a slice of ham could mean to someone.It might taste differently to you after reading this classic memoir.
B001MYIXAC|2.0|Having read rave reviews of the movie and the book, I read the book. It's very, very good. Finally watched the movie last night -- very disappointed. The story is chopped up and abbreviated (necessarily so, I guess, to get it into movie length), but for example: the story of Hakan -- absolutely central to the book and running from beginning to end -- is nearly discarded in the movie. And the stories of the gaggle of drunks -- Virginia et al -- is poorly addressed also.     The book is wonderful. The movie - not so much. I guess I could say it another way -- if you at all liked the movie, you should DEFINITELY read the book. It's substantially different and will greatly improve on and expand your interest in the movie.
B002JM1VJG|5.0|First of all i would like to point out that this is her Greatest Hits DVD COMPLILATION !!!!!!!!! NOT the single \\"Celebration\\".....so stop with the bashing!! Ok you may hate the song but this is a DVD video package so go review the single elsewhere!    RIGHT! On with the review....Theres not a lot to say really (im lying), a few words maybe...ICON, Legend, Diva, Visionary, Queen Of Pop... This is Madonna ladies and gentlemen, her greatest video singles pulled together in one visually stimulating place. Im not going to mince my words, artistically the lady is unique when it comes to excersisng her creative mind, nothing is to elaborate, risque or challenging, in fact the more challenging the better, and we as her captive audience are all the better for that. She doesnt feel the need to play to genres, stick with the same old same old, from day one with the release of her first video single \\"Everybody\\" back in the summer of 1982, she tapped into the underground club culture of down town New York and its vibrant new wave scene. She had that video filmed at a club called Danceteria, a place which gave her the break she needed to make her first ever mark on the music world. The video was unashamedly raw, with a budget of $1, 500 it was shot in a single day and sent out to clubs with no mixing, editing or visual alterations, just what Madonna wanted and it worked...the video gave her a certain amount of cult kudos, the darling of the disco label that would carry on through her career no matter what musical path she would choose to take, dance never left her...even if the song itself was a sombre affair you could bet that with each of those downbeat moments there was an uplifting remix to carry it over to the clubs, its in her veins. But she was clever, most music artists were sceptical of the music video when it first became a medium with which to touch the fans, in the first half of the 80's most artists passed them over, a few like Michael Jackson, Prince and Madonna sawthe potential and grabbed it with both arms, Madonna learned that she could portray her song through the video, a form of expression with which to entertain, self herself AND to question or provoke, that coupled with her love of changing faces made her the greatest female entertainer of our time, and the most successful. Because of her videos some of these faces, more specifically the costumes she chose to adorn - have become cult icons in their own right. Her conicled brassieres and ponytail, the Virgin wedding dress, the Marylin monroe pastiche look and the Marlene Deitrich styled androgynous suit used in 1989's Express Yourself video, have altered fashion and peoples perception of her and women in general; through the form of video she could chanel different characters even, mini movies so to speak which would push the sexual boundaries and cross multi cultural divides like 1994's Secret, Madonna played a white lower class club singer who was married to an African/American gangster, interacial relationships were at the time, extremely controversial in America, and still are. In 1992's Erotica video she chose to unleash her alter ego Dita, a dominatrix who pushed the boundaries of what was expected of women at that moment in time and broach the subject of homosexuality through its exploration of same sex love, with 1993's Bad Girl she chose to portray herself as a sad and lonely business woman who finds her solace in death, heavy stuff when you think of the chubby girl bouncing around on the set of 1983's video to her hit Holiday. But its not all been serious!, nobody knows how to party like Madonna and boy do many of her videos reflect that...1992's Deeper And Deeper paid homage to close friend Andy Warhol and his style of film making, casting flamboyant artists of the time like german actor Udo Keir, the gay porn industries heavy weight Chi Chi La Rue and her very own friends and actresses Debbie Mazzar and Sophia Coppolla; with them Madonna toured the flamboyant gay underground clubs of 1970's L.A., the video was actually inspired by and dedicated to one of Warhols favourite muses from the 1970's and who he collaborated with on several occassions, Madonna played Eddie Sedgewick, a cult actress whom appeared in several of his classic films.    The collection we have here are some of the most captivating, cutlurally significant and artistically beautiful videos ever created, some are pithy at best such as 1993's Fever video produced by uber cool producer Stephane Sednaoui, others such as 1993's Rain are mesmerising for the sheer effort and beauty, the video was shot in black and white and hand coloured by every single frame to give it an almost oceanic quality, this video won several awards including a grammy, one of many for her visual work. The latter part of Madonnas visual career saw her roller-scating in discos (Sorry, 2006), enchanting her audience in the arizona desert (Frozen, 1998), air walking over the pacific ocean accompanied by thousands of faries (Love Profusion, 2004) and brutally fighting her darker side, and winning!, in 2002's award winning clip to her hit single Die Another Day. Shes circumnavigated the globe from Japan to the canals of venice and even appeared in a futuristic styled universe where she has her dreams analysed as a crew member of a mothership (1995's Bedtime Story), that video was later acquired for the New York Museum of Modern Art's film and video collection due to its cultural and influential significance, it was also the most expensive video created at that time surpassing her own Express Yourself in terms of cost.    Along with entertaining her audience with videos Madonna has also used the medium to provoke, not in a negative way but to make her audience question the life around them, she see's herself in a privalidged position and was once quoted as saying \\"if i can make people sit up and take notice then i will, if i can make them confront their fears then i will do that also, i like to provoke, its good to challenge\\". That has been her driving force, a driving force which some people may view as pushing her audience too far, 2003's banned video to the song American Life, was as explicit as it was beautiful, brought to us as an anti-war video (the Iraqi invasion), Madonna wanted us to see why she was against the so called war on terror which, rather disgustingly on our behalf, backfired, so much so that she even pulled the video herself, something she had never done before... 4 of her clips have been banned, 1990's Justify My Love, 1992's Erotica, 2001's What It feels Like For A Girl and the most recent American Life. Many broached subjects such as sex, cultural themes or in the latters case, war, but never had she omitted defeat, this time she was forced to do so or possibly lose her life! The clip aired on German TV for a week before it was pulled, an oozy totting soldier shooting jets of water from a pimped up mini cooper at hoards of press type moguls watching a bloody catwalk parade wihich turns from high fashion to mangled soldiers and limbless children, it was as blatant as it was shocking, it really did portray the horrors of war, but we chose not to look, afraid to face reality? The video sank along with the album but to her fans it remains her most accomplished work and most daring, we can only pray it makes its debut here.    Wether she's been the darling of the disco or the oozy tooting military babe, Madonnas videos have always inspired, revolutionised and given people a chance to escape from the mundane, her works such as 1990's Vogue directed by Aliens director David Fincher continue to inspire even as i type, the art deco black and white video made waves when it was aired for its revolutionary style of visuals, costume and, of course, the dance...a movement she tapped into whilst clubbing with friends in late 80's New York, excited by the gay club scene which had liberated her in the 1970's as a ballet student, she purposelyhired the most aesthetic and beautiful gay men to portray themselves with raw abandonment, the video went on to win several awards that year and then go down in the anals of celluloid history as a milestone in the creation of pop videos worldwide, the song was a smash around the globe, further proof that what she tapped into all those years before was worth its weight in gold. One can only wonder where her next visual feast will take us? Jupiter? Oh yeah, she did that with 2006's Get Together.... anything is possible as this collection will prove, wether Kraftwerk Ghetto Camp (2000's Music) or Japanese Manga (2006's Jump) we are sure to be enthralled and captivated just like we were when she writhed in a Gondala for 1984's Like A Virgin, this complilation is testament to the genius that she really is and like it or not, you can bet your bottom dollar there will be more where the last 68 videos have come from and a clutch of eager divas just ready to carbon copy her! Celebration indeed.
B000053V7Q|4.0|Yes, yes, all the reviews here still apply, and Elvis is Elvis but I think everyone should know, BEFORE buying this DVD, that the song \\"I just can't help believing\\" is not on this DVD! I saw the movie when I was a kid and that song really stuck in my head. Thirty years later, I'm still humming it! I blindly bought this DVD and 'I just can't believe' that this song is not there?! To make things worse, it plays tantalizingly on the menu! (My younger son said, Appa why don't you just listen to the menu!) This is the kind of marketing BS that makes me ill. It is common practice to leave out at least one great song on a \\"best of...\\" or a \\"...greatest hits\\" to force you to buy another CD for that one song you love, but this is too much. A \\"Special Edition\\" DVD without the best rendition I've ever heard, of a great song. I bought this DVD for one song and it isn't there!

B000LXCJLO|5.0|One of the best from 80s. Entire album is just great. Very talented musicians. Morten has an incredible voice. You will not be disappointed.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This dvd is intense. It starts at a grueling first level, then as you adapt you move on to the remaining two levels. I am still on the first level after working out with it for a couple weeks. It is a definite sweat breaker for twenty minutes. You will be sore if your not an experienced strength trainer. You get your twenty minutes worth with this dvd.

B0026JWDQW|5.0|I was going to write a fairly lengthy review to go along with my 5 stars but, honestly, I couldn't possibly improve on Carsten Knoch's review.      For what it's worth, I'm new to Paolo Nutini, thanks to a Week-End Edition segment on NPR on Aug. 8th.  Don't you get the greatest feeling when you discover an artist that makes your heart smile?  Both of his CD's do that and more though, I must confess, I prefer Sunny Side Up just for the sheer variety and exuberance.

B001E780W8|3.0|Let's start with the simple truth... this would be what some would call Slipknot's \\"sellout\\" album. It happens to every band, they run out of creative steam and start to \\"change\\" their sound, which draws in new people, of course.   But what does it change to? It changes into sounding just like every other mainstream band today.  I like the Iowa days, right up to most of Subliminal Verses. I liked the feel of the music back then, but that's just me... Now it's lost it's bite through most of the album, but I did enjoy the songs Psychosocial, Dead Memories, and Sulfur was alright.    All around decent, if somewhat sub par...
B00007AJGH|5.0|I wonder if people nowadays realize just why this movie was so incredibly popular back in the day.    Come on, you had Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse together falling from the sky!      You had Donald and Daffy Duck together playing piano in some theater!       You had Roger Rabbit himself who was fantastic because he was so entertaining and had you laughing constantly.    Most importantly, you had reality and cartoons combined and it looked totally believable like the real people were actually communicating with the cartoon characters.  Come on, back in the late 80's many people (children and adults) were a bit surprised film directors were able to pull off something like this.  It was bizarre, it was unique, and the movie is quite entertaining as a result and worth watching several times over.  This movie was a huge step forward for film directors and I'd say it was a pretty big influence on todays films.    Along with the Back to the Future movies, Who Framed Roger Rabbit is one of the greatest movies at the time, and honestly the film still holds up and looks remarkable today.      What's interesting is that I'm defending a movie that I honestly HATED when it first came out, but the reason I hated it was because I was a child in the late 80's and expected nothing but a cartoon from beginning to end.  Now I understand the appeal.      The ONLY problem with this film is that the final 20 minutes get insanely whacky to the point it's somewhat hard to follow.  A remarkable film, and a classic future generations of children and adults must watch at least once.    Oh, and remember that scene where the guy was driving his real car through all the colorful animations with the trees, sun, and sky singing along?  There's a popular TV commercial on TV right now (the one with the Loretta Lynn song) that was probably influenced by that scene.
B000E1NWGO|5.0|Rubinstein has to be my favorite pianist when it comes to Beethoven. He conveys the right amount of tranquility and excitement for all four of these sonatas that are featured on this disc. Unlike Rudolf Kempff, Rubinstein plays the first movement of the \\"Moonlight\\" very slowly (but not too slow) and the third movement very quickly (but not to the point that it feels like the speed of light). I think this portrays Beethoven's original intentions almost perfectly. \\"Pathetique\\" is also a hit, with a  relatively intense first movement that actually sounds intense, and a meditative second movement that actually sounds meditative. \\"Appassionata\\" and \\"Les Adieux\\" are  some of my least favorite works from Beethoven, but the two pieces still manage to make me feel very comfortable. Rubinstein once again plays brilliantly here. Now normally, I focus only on the composer and his music rather than the players that perform the music, but here, I can't help but admire Rubinstein for his extraordinary performances of Beethoven's greatest piano sonatas. Kudos to both the composer and pianist for these splendid recordings.<br /><br />Also, one of the reviewers said that the slight tape hiss ruined this recording. Well, that's because these works were recorded in the early 60's, where analogues were being used. So therefore, all of the tape hiss can't be removed even with today's technology. And besides, why be so bothered by it? This is a classic recording of some of Beethoven's most beloved piano works, and we should all enjoy it for what it is.
B0018QCXGY|1.0|First of all ... just how stupid are the people of New York City?  When their city was under attack by this monster, the people of New York did EVERYTHING wrong!!<br />When buildings were coming down and the head from the Statue of Liberty was flung thousands of yards (crushing somebody's car upon impact) people SHOULD have started running, but instead they stood in the street and talked about it and took pictures with their cell phones.  Do these people have no self preservation insinct at all?<br /><br />Next we see the looting going on.  People stealing CD players, speakers and other consumer electronics.  I'm sorry, but if your city is under attack and your life is in danger and you're going to make time for looting, STEAL A HANDGUN OR A SHOTGUN AND SOME AMMO!!  Survival is more important than audio or video equipment!!<br /><br />Also, when they bomb the monster, WHY did they send in a B2 Stealth Bomber?  The U.S. Airforce has other bombers that would have been much better suited for the job.  The B2 is slow, maneuvers poorly and has a history of navigational problems.  The ONLY advantage to the B2 Stealth bomber is that it's stealth technology means that it can evade detection on certain types of radar.<br /><br />Did the U.S. military REALLY believe that this monster was tracking our aircraft with some sort of radar?<br /><br />And when the evac helicopter tries to fly the civilians to safety shouldn't it have flown AWAY from the monster, rather than heading towards and directly OVER IT?  Doesn't that fly right in the face of good sense?  Sure, it LOOKED more dramatic that way, but flying over a 10-story monster that's being hit with artillery is a good way to get killed.  They should have flown AWAY from the combat zone, NOT DIRECTLY OVER IT!
B00000J7SS|5.0|Two ways of opening up to this big tidal wave of an album.  The easy one, but very rewarding at that: put your headphones on and go and sit in the dark preferably late at night. If this doesn't send shivers down your spine, well then this just isn't your kind of album.  The alternative, admittedly a little bit harder to pull off: have it played really loud somewhere in a concert hall or theatre near you, through a big pile of speakers, while a group of incredible dancers are really bringing the voodoo down.  In 2003, the famed Rosas dance company (choreographer Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker) came out with their amazing Bitches Brew / Tacoma Narrows production. If you ever get the chance of seeing this ensemble of role-related improvisations with each dancer impersonating an instrument, don't hesitate.  And if you don't like \\"modern dance\\", go anyway, close your eyes and let the waves roll over you, over and over again...    ps Tacoma Narrows after a bridge in Washington state which started to \\"dance\\" and fell to pieces. The idea: how much disorder can a system bear before it collapses...

1595141979|5.0|I couldn't put this  book down.  When I first started the series, the first book was kind of hard to get into with all of the information about the different types of vampires.  By the second book, I was hooked.  I just finished the 3rd book and I can't wait til my fourth book arrives in two weeks.
0761119752|5.0|I have been reading this book just about every night for the past 7 years.  Actually, I don't read it anymore, this catchy bedtime story has been recited by me for many years.  My older child no longer has me read this to her, but the younger one has this as part of her nightly routine.  The whimsical Boynton animals go through all the steps of going to bed in a series of delightful illustrations.  The kids and I just love those cute Boynton animals with their hilarious expressions.<br /><br />I buy this book for all of my friends and family members when they are expecting a new baby.  It's the perfect bedtime story.
1400063515|5.0|A highly interesting author with some timely critiques of the risk management that got so many banks in trouble with mortgage backed securities. He also does an excellent job describing some of the common fallacies we make with statistics and risk and how our brains are wired to best understand the linear relationships that defined the pre-modern world, not the nonlinear world we live in today.
0140544518|5.0|The True Story of the Three Little Pigs is one of my favorite stories to read to my two girls.  I like it because the illustrations are incredibly detailed and very funny (in a slightly off-beat and twisted way).  I also love that the story is told from the poor wolf's perspective.<br /><br />This book is one that illustrates that there are always two sides to every story.  We all know the pigs' side of the story, and in this delightfully funny version, we get to hear the wolf's side.<br /><br />I've had this book for several years now and it has been a family favorite.  Children as young as two will find this story very funny.  My oldest child is nearly eight and she still thinks this book is a riot.  On several occasions she has brought this book in to school to share with her class.  We have yet to come across a group of children who don't like this book.
0061231401|2.0|A Doomsday read<br />2 stars for the 200 pages of interesting material and end notes.<br />James Rollins has become a formulae writer.  Like Steve Berry, Mr. Rollins takes a very interesting premise and ruins it with an overwritten, too  much action story.  I felt I was reading about Indiana Jones and the Lost Doomsday Key.  There was so much promise, and then when Mr. Glen Beck hyped the book I said I'll give Mr. Rollins another shot.  Boy, was I let down.  Still, the premise was so good that I simply skipped all the over-the-top action and read the very interesting parts concerning Saint Malachy, bog fires, and Egyptian migration into France.  So much potential for a Dan Brown type thriller combined with Holy Blood Holy Grail, that it was too bad Mr. Rollins wasted 200 pages of the book on shoot-em-up-bang-bang.  I'm done with Mr. Rollins and Sigma.  Just too lightweight for me.<br />Character development is shallow.  We've read about all the Sigma players before and the action sequences have become tiresome.<br />Too much gratuitous action for me.  I felt I was reading a Matt Reilly pulp fiction.  Pages and pages of impossible situations where the players were able to eventually escape.  Boring.  Reminded me of those Saturday matinee back in the `50s, where just in the nick of time the hero was saved by some incredible feat that stretched the credulity of the audience.  Good news:  No gratuitous sex or language.<br />Can't recommend.  Well maybe as a paperback if it's 11 PM, the flight is delayed, and it's the last book in the store and you need something to put you to sleep.  Mr. Rollins needs to go back underground.

B0025T65GC|5.0|Ki is by far Devin Townsend's most confident, thought-out, and brilliant album to date. Every song is perfect in its structure and execution. I've listened to this album on every level possible (driving, walking, background, and acutely listening) and it never gets old, really. I very much look forward to his future work if Ki is anything to go by, which it is. Highly recommended.
B0028K31CE|5.0|I waited along with the world for this cd  for 8 years and the wait was well worth it. Maxwell did not disappoint me with this wonderful collection of songs. This is a nice cd with thoughtful classy music.I like some songs more than a couple ( Cold and Playing Possum not my taste). The song \\"Pretty Wings\\" is just a sweet lovely song. I appreciate Maxwell mixing in the different tempos and messages. Looking forward to the second and third installments of this trilogy.
B001GKYBXA|3.0|...by the ecstatic praise that this album has received.  Much as I have tried to love it, much as I have wanted to love it, I cannot love it, because the music strikes me as shallow and sloppily pasted together.  I find it a chaotic stew of unripe musical bits floating in a broth of overproduced reverb and electronic sound effects.  The original concept was for Paul and Youth to create 13 songs from start to finish, devoting one day only to each song.  The effects of that workplan show, and not in a good way.  All the reverb and electronic noodling in the world cannot conceal the fact that most of the songs are poorly thought out and underdeveloped.  We should expect no more, as this is not Paul's usual style of working.  He is a well known perfectionist and workaholic who does not ordinarily settle for mediocrity.  But under a self-imposed time constraint, he must have been forced to lower his standards.    It's too bad, because Paul had been on an epic roll of great albums since \\"Flaming Pie.\\"  In that creative burst, occurring when he was well into middle age, he wrote at least a dozen songs that are at a high Beatles level and would now be considered classics had they been written in the 1960s.  They were all marked by deceptively simple tunes that are, in fact, the core of artfully layered and complex musical pieces.  Certain people of little understanding have dismissed this work as mere pop drivel.  What they really mean is that they cannot relate to music that is not hard rock or hard blues and has a strong melodic element.  Too bad for them.    I am second to no one in my admiration and respect for Paul.  He is without question the preeminent popular songwriter and musician of our era.  The world is a much better place for his having been in it, and I hope that he will return to writing and performing the kind of great music that has long been his trademark.
B001PPLKI0|3.0|This is an excellent sounding/packaged set of ELVIS's gospel music, one of three or four \\"complete\\"-type sets issued over the last decade or so.HOWEVER ...a major spiritual-oriented Elvis recording MIRACLE OF THE ROSARY is conspicuously missing. Why? Because the producers were told by BMG NOT to include the track because it was to \\"christian\\" and may offend non-christian listeners. ARE YOU KIDDING ME??!!??? YOU A**HOLES!!!

B002CAWNEM|2.0|There's nothing different or imaginative about this movie. Basically If you see Fatal Attraction you have seen this movie. Except for minor details. Not even  Beyonce and Ali Larter would have made this movie better.Save your money buy something else. Rent Fatal Attraction instead.
B0002234LS|2.0|I like Stephen King's writing quite a bit.  He knows what is truly scary: gutter-dwelling clowns, children, zombie pets, and menacing machines.  Unfortunately, when King's stories make the leap from the page to the screen, they often lose their psychological suspense.  Perhaps it's because the tension of King's stories come from what takes place within the protagonist's mind rather than external forces.    Another difficulty is that King can write amazingly tense stories with endings that go flat.  For example, IT was truly scary...creepy clowns...scary sounds coming from the sewer...but it turns out to be a giant spider?  Not so scary.     \\"Secret Window\\" is another attempt to bring one of King's novellas to the screen, but it falls flat because it lacks suspense and has a poor ending you can see from a mile away.  I'm not a particular fan of Johnny Depp; however, it's Depp's skill as an actor that saves this movie from being a waste of time.
B001H9MYPW|5.0|I've had unipolar depression my whole adult life.  Thus, I had to get into medication and outpatient therapy for many years in my 20s.  Decades later I still must take the medication but I haven't needed therapy in a long time.  However, those early intense years of therapy were extremely helpful for the rest of my life.  This series absolutely faithfully duplicates the entire experience. Gabriel Byrne could be a real psychiatrist.  I've never seen a movie or tv shrink this faithful to the real deal. Even better, when he himself is in therapy, it is absolutely real to life that he himself is a mess when he is the patient in therapy.  The patients are diverse in age, sex, race and problems.  In short, there is something for everyone with this patient base.  I especially enjoyed the college girl with cancer who would not get treatment, Josh Mahoney (the father in FRASIER) as a CEO under fire, and the young boy with the constantly battling, divorcing parents. This season, Paul is also under siege with a malpractice suit, which was filed against him by the family of a patient who killed himself. The ends of treatment for each patient are realistic as well.  Rather than seeing the patient off to a \\"happily ever after life\\", which would be impossible, Paul instead sees them off to an uncertain future but one in which they probably have a better idea of who they are as individuals and what they have as strengths and weaknesses. Season 1 was excellent as well. HBO does it again.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B0028SVXR6|4.0|As a huge fan of de-loused and Frances, I've been struggling with Mars last two releases quite a bit.  Here and there I've enjoyed them, but over all, I'll be honest, it's over the top for me.  Octahedron brings this amazing band back to where I personally like them........On Earth.  Thank you!  Love it!
B00000J7SS|5.0|Obviously, I am coming to this from a Progressive Rock perspective.  I think that bands like King Crimson, Emerson Lake and Palmer, and Pink Floyd might very well have been influenced by this album.  I think this album is kind of like Milestones meets King Crimson's Starless And Bible Black (the song).  It wouldn't surprise me at all if King Crimson's improvisations from the mid 70's were inspired by Bitches Brew.  Anyway, this is a great album in spite of the fact that it might not be representative of \\"typical\\" Miles Davis.  I would strongly urge any Jazz fans who like this album and are not familiar with 70's Progressive Rock to pick up albums such as King Crimson's Larks' Tongues In Aspic, Starless And Bible Black, and Red as well as Emerson Lake and Palmer's self-titled album, Tarkus, Trilogy, and Brain Salad Surgery.  Like Bitches Brew, the music on these albums dives headlong into the future.  They are a great combination of Rock 'n' Roll with heavy Jazz and Classical influences.  If you're really brave, pick up King Crimson's Projekcts (sic) boxed set.  This is 90's King Crimson featuring Adrian Belew and the legendary Tony Levin.  Don't forget to pick up Bitches Brew too if you don't already own it!
0307266303|5.0|This book has it all--great characters, an intriguing story, inspiration, and practical advice on running. I think that if UltraMarathon Man began to spark an interest in ultarunning running, this book brings it to new heights. Unlike Karnazes who is just rah rah you can do it too, Born to Run gives new information and new insight in to how to run with pleasure and without injury. It's also a combination of an adventure story and a history of American running.   One warning: you'll become obssessed!
B001P9KR8U|5.0|Slumdog Millionaire brings to life a most unusual but plausible story of a young man who had to raise himself with his brother on the streets of Mumbai and deal with his affection and ever increasing love for a young woman who seems to be pitifully elusive. In addition, he must fight against the thugs and street gangs, one of which his brother eventually joins for excitement and money. Yes, on the surface it's about a young man who is so good at the Indian TV version of \\"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire\\" that the police torture him to make him reveal \\"his way of cheating\\" on the quiz show. However, this film goes so much deeper; we see his life in a series of flashbacks as he explains to the police just how he was actually able to know all the answers to the questions on the quiz show. In addition, the cinematography and the choreography lack nothing; I couldn't ask for better. The casting was wonderfully done with great care and the acting is extremely convincing--wow, what a group of actors they had in this movie! The musical score enhances the movie as well.<br /><br />When the action starts, we meet two young boys who are brothers, the very young Salim (Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail) and Jamal (Ayush Mahesh Khedekar). After they witness their mother being brutally killed by an angry mob, the two young boys are defenseless and they toughen up pretty quickly to adapt to being on their own, although Salim seems to do a little bit better at it. Salim is not afraid of much and he even sells his brother's prized celebrity autograph merely because he wants the money for himself; when Jamal is upset about it Salim just smiles and says he got good money for it and so that makes it right. Already we are seeing Salim going to the wrong side of the tracks. Salim and Jamal also meet another orphaned child, Latika (Rubina Ali) and Jamal takes a liking to Latika almost immediately, he even feels that with a third kid they can be just like \\"The Three Musketeers!\\"<br /><br />As time goes by we see the boys grow and develop; but Latika is sadly left behind when the boys climb aboard a moving train to escape the evil operator of an \\"orphanage\\" who likes to maim the youngsters who he forces to beg for money in the streets. Jamal misses Latika very, very badly but Salim just makes light of it; Jamal however is determined to find Latika and ultimately make her his own no matter low long his search for her takes. Eventually they do find Latika but Salim and Latika mysteriously spurn Jamal; and then it takes Jamal several years more to find Latika again. As adults, we see the grown Jamal (Dev Patel), Salim (Madhur Mittal) and Latika (Freida Pinto) coping with life and trying to work on relationships as best they can under horrible circumstances that I will not reveal here; I don't want to give you any spoilers. Of course, what you do know is that Jamal makes it onto the quiz show and he is well on his way to winning a lot of money; he even gets around the game show host Prem Kumar (Anil Kapoor) who tries to throw Jamal off with a phony tip on the answer to the next question on the quiz show.<br /><br />The rest is left for you to discover; but I shall say you won't be bored. This is an excellent, poignant film that will leave you with quite a lasting impression. The extras on the DVD are quite well done, too. I especially liked the featurette entitled \\"Slumdog Dreams: Danny Boyle & The Making of Slumdog Millionaire.\\" There are optional audio commentaries by director Danny Boyle and Dev Patel and producer Christian Colson and writer Simon Beaufoy. We get deleted scenes, too.<br /><br />Slumdog Millionaire makes a great addition to your DVD collection; it did win eight Academy Awards including the Oscar for Best Picture and that alone proves this movie is very, very special. There is a modicum of violence so if you're turned off by that you may wish to reconsider; but the way this plays out is so artistic that you might just want to get this and enjoy itanyway.
B000VWOV3O|5.0|I beleive the folks who gave this a one star review are missing the point.  Here are the five greatest Mahavishnu Orchastra CDs, with original recording quality available in digital format for less than $19, instead of $35.  For those of us who are old enough to have all the original albums, this is an ideal way to get all of them in digital format for cheap.  Yes, they don't come with the liner notes; but if you want those, they're all available for free online.  Or, if you insist on having them in hand, you can spend the $7 per CD and get them.
B001NXDIMK|3.0|Glen Close and William Hurt do their best in this mess of a second season.  Whenever they are onscreen, they manage to make this overly plotted mess work.  However, let anyone else onstage and I can barely figure out what is going on or care. The young woman attorney who works for Close is a big part of the problem.  Her character is playing all sides against the middle.  I can barely keep track of who she is plotting and conspiring with to undo Close from episode to episode. Hurt is kind of the bad guy here.  I say kind of because his motivations are not all bad.  Rather, he is hiding some huge secrets.  I had no problem following the arc of his story line.  I also had no problem following the arc of Patty's (Close) story line as she tries to win her suit against Hurt's former corporate employer yet also has to deal with her son's rebellion (seeing an older woman and refusing to go to college) and her husband's infidelity. Even Arthur Frobisher's (Ted Danson) reappearance is easy to follow, even funny, as he turns his zeal to other interests.  It is the whole story line between Patty (Close) and the young woman attorney which had me completely perplexed.  It was also very annoying to have this jump back and forth in time constantly.  Seeing this on tv was one thing.  Buying it on DVD?  No way. I really enjoyed season one and did not have any problems with it.  If you haven't seen it, that is the DVD to obtain.
0815411839|5.0|Most likely we will never be 100% sure of the final hours of Marilyn Monroe on this world, but if I have to believe anything written so far I will go for Donald Spoto's version of the facts.    The amount of details on this book are simply amazing and throughout you really have the feeling that you get to know Marilyn from her days as Norma Jean to the superstardom of Marilyn Monroe.    All the dates and the research was so amazingly captivating that I could not put the book down once I've started reading it.    Straight forward, accurate, precise and concise, I will recommend this book to all of those who still believe that the Kennedy brothers happen to be involved with Marilyn Monroe and her tragic end.    10 out of 10

0743487486|2.0|I am glad that I read it because it has great ideas but I think I will take the ideas and questions that I felt were appropriate and find another avenue with which to explore them.  There is so much of the book that is almost shaming parents and telling what not to do that his message gets lost.  It's very daunting to read page after page of all the horrible things you are doing to your child if you give them a time out.  I think as a whole the idea of unconditional parenting is to raise children and punishements and rewards controls children.  Again, good ideas but I think a more positive message would be beneficial.  He's very passionate about his message and I think he's right on alot of points but the doom and gloom and shame interferes with the book and message.

B0017ZB8M6|1.0|[...]  I saw a concert on television, I think for New Years Day, and her voice was blind, not knowing what note to hit.  On digital audio, her voice is created and maintained by tuning computer programs.    The instrument works are not at all hers.  Whether or not she has real people working on them with real instruments or not is irrelevant as no one I've learned of is credited.  The only satisfying instance of instrumentals is in Thinking of You.    [...]  The most notable song for its lyrics is I Kissed a Girl and that's for all the wrong reasons.  Sexual experimentation is okay, but her lyrics in the song make her sound insecure and as if she's done someone wrong by doing that.  I personally find something such as that very offensive.  Her or my sexuality is irrelevant.  People should not be ashamed of their sexuality and her songs convey insulting messages to people.    Whether she has a bad voice, boring instrumentals, fake boobies, or insulting morals[...]
B001N26GFM|5.0|I don't usually liked war themed films but \\"the Boy in The Striped Pajamas\\" looked like such a sweet yet brutal story when I saw the previews.<br /><br />When I watched it I was surprised at the range of emotions that it evoked.It was a story about taboo friendships and the common threads that bind us as humans no matter what the circumstance.<br />There were some very strong characters in the movie and the acting top notch. It showed how hate is taught and cultivated not inborn.<br /><br />It shows how the innocence of a child can be his salvation and it can also be his destruction.Watching the friendship between the little german boy and the \\"little jewish boy in the concentration camp\\" was so touching and heart tugging, watching their confusion as to why they were supposed to hate each other was in itself a message,and the fact that they didn't hate each other should be the answer..  .The fence that kept them apart was not very constricting but at the same time it was as vast as an ocean between them.<br /><br />This is such a powerful movie that I was in awe and shock at the boldness of the last act.<br />I won't give too much away as not to spoil but I will say that during the last act I was saying to myself \\"they couldn't allow this to happen could they?\\"but then I thought again and said \\"why not?\\"what makes the person in question any less deserving of such cruelty than the others involved.<br /><br />This movie will stay with you long after you take it out of the DVD player.
B000WS4QJG|5.0|My experience with Amazon has been pleasant, however, when I order three products for the artist Michael Jackson, the shipping was very bad.    No way to give feedback, false receiving dates given. Just terrible service on this product, and others of like nature!:(
0061537934|5.0|I bought this in the grocery story on a whim last night and stayed up until 2:45 reading it.  I'm transfixed!  There's a lot of subtle New Thought hidden in this little book.  It reminds me a little of Paulo Coelho, whose style I love.  If this type of book is your inclination, I'd say buy it.  It's a great read.
B001FB55H6|1.0|Watchmen is an incredibly sloshed piece of work.  Maybe it's just me, but picking up the superhero shtick in the 80s was a mistake.  It leaves you with nothing to build a plot around except turmoil and pain.  Originally comic book heroes came to life to bring people out of their daily problems.  In the 1980s things changed and not only were they so weak they could not lift us out of our mournful existence, but heaped upon us their own set of horrors, anxieties and depressions.  The whole idea behind superheros was discarded.  Watchmen is a prime example of this, only the producers and directors actually found ways to make it worse.  Sure they added the sex in there, which wasn't necessary, but they had a real difficult time telling the story.  It comes off like a comic book that had been torn apart and pieced together by some madman.  The premise I suppose offered some hope, but the movie actually was terrible.  If you can go out and watch the grass grow, do it. It'll be more fulfilling.<br /><br />David Brollier<br />author of The 3rd Covenant<br />[...]
B0014G5LG2|1.0|I simply cannot understand the ecstatic reviews of this utterly insipid performance of this brilliant work. I've been listening to various performance of this symphony for 30 years and this one stands out as the one that seems most completely off the mark of what Mahler expressed throughout his composing career, namely passion, gravitas, a certain gallows humor, and, ultimately, profound spirituality. While I will admit that it seems a little unfair to criticize a performance of a work that was far from complete at the composer's death, other conductors have done, in my view, an infinitely better job with this still immensely powerful symphony (although not in this deadening performance). Everything seems wrong with it and I literally mean everything. Melodies are muddied by failing to bring out essential voices, moments of breathtaking feeling are rushed through, and appropriate tension building is completely absent. I have never wanted my money back after buying a recording from amazon, but I really wish I could with this one. I was drawn in by the mysteriously enthusiastic reviews for this recording, but I've learned that one, ultimately, has one reviewer he can truly rely on; himself.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I very much enjoy TBBT and have Season One DVD already. Looking forward to getting Season Two, and watching Season Three this fall. The writers have some challenges ahead and some pitfalls to avoid. Would like to see \\"Ramona Nowitzki\\" (\\"The Cooper-Nowitzki Theorem\\")come back and maybe even be Sheldon's girlfriend. Sheldon is the only character that hasn't 'hooked up', and the writers have to answer that question sooner or later. They also have to be careful how and how much they tease the Leonard and Penny storyline, because they can only go to that well x many times before it might wear thin.     Great show, and I hope we get to enjoy it for many more seasons.
B002DKF47O|5.0|Behemoth's sound has slowly but surely evolved into true greatness. \\"Demigod\\" really showed the power and talent that this band is capable of. With \\"The Apostasy\\", Behemoth showed that they were well onto something absolutly incredible. \\"The Left Hand Ov God\\" simply has to go down as one of the best Blackened/Death songs ever. The video is even more amazing and convey's Behemoth true creativity and power. But finally with \\"The Evangelion\\", they have really managed to burn their mark forever on the world of music and leave ashes in the wake. This album flows with an incredible sonic pace. There are no weak songs on the album, each song just lends to the next. \\"Ov Fire And The Void\\" is a true accomplishment of music greatness. The songs on this album are layered with incredible guitars, none bleeding over the other. Inferno's drums are devastating in their power, speed and sound. The album has an organic feel to it and has none of today's overprocessed, \\"tin can\\" sound. Nergal has really pushed the envelope and come up with a truelly great album, one I believe that will talked about for many, many years to come. If you have the chance to see them live as I have, you will find out they can pull all of the greatness off and add even more power, more hate, more granduer.
B001DJLCPE|4.0|The Film:<br /><br />Kubrick's best film? Tough to say. 2001, A Clockwork Orange, and Spartacus are pretty darned good. One of the best dark comedies of the 20th Century? Easily. Probably the single best. Consistently, some times uproariously funny, \\"Dr. Strangelove\\" is an indisputable classic. It expertly weaves the paranoia and fear of the period with phenomenal comedic performances, to both funny and chilling effect. Peter Sellers is absolutely stunning in this film, as is George C. Scott. The nuclear farce escalates and escalates throughout the 90 minute run-time, ultimately culminating in... well, I won't spoil it.<br /><br />Simply put, this is one of those films everyone should see before they die.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray:<br /><br />This is a tough disc to review. The movie is so incredibly good that it might be blinding to the flaws in the presentation. And flaws there are.<br /><br />The first one that will strike anyone who's seen this film before on home video is that this film is not presented in the 1.33:1 \\"academy ratio.\\" Instead, it is cropped to a 1.66:1 ratio which is very close to today's widescreen TVs, with *very* slender black bars on the sides.<br /><br />Now, I'm as big a fan of widescreen images as the next guy. But I'm an even bigger fan of seeing everything the director intended me to see, i.e. the original aspect ratio of a piece of film. Apparently, when Sr. Strangelove was transferred to laserdisc, Kubrick told Criterion that the film is supposed to switch from 1.33:1 to 1.66:1 aspect ratios, depending on scene. In the war room, for instance, the lighting above and some binders below the 1.66:1 frame were intended to be seen. Since this disc is fixed at 1.66:1, the image never opens up to show us this information. Is it story critical? No. But it could have been present, given the existence of other Blu-Ray discs that switch aspect ratios on the fly. It's too bad that it wasn't done here.<br /><br />Another potentially problematic aspect of this transfer is video noise. I am a big proponent of film grain being presented realistically in a HD image. I don't want it scrubbed away by excessive \\"noise reduction.\\" But this image strains my tolerance. Static backdrops and human faces positively swim with noise, much of which looks more \\"digital\\" than true \\"analog\\" film grain. I truly wonder whether a projected film print would have this kind of noise. Again, some sort of happy medium should have been achieved.<br /><br />OK, bad news out of the way, I can still say that this is a highly watchable transfer. Blacks are much more solid than the previous DVD, and detail in some scenes is good (but not great). For a 45 year-old b&w presentation, this looks pretty good. It's not at the level of the recent \\"Casablanca\\" or \\"Seventh Seal\\" Blu-Rays, but it certainly holds its own.<br /><br />Audio is presented in a 5.1 channel mix, as well as the original mono. The surround mix is pleasant, splitting some of the info (such as gunshots or airplane noise) out into the rear surrounds.<br /><br />Extras are mostly carried over from the most recent DVD edition, with one new documentary included, and the film trailer tragically absent. It was a GREAT trailer, very 60's modern and cool. Really sad and kind of inexplicable that it was left out. The docs are presented in 480p, which is kind of lame. The \\"commentary\\" is a combination text overlay/video interview trivia track. Unfortunately, the text overlays pretty much half of the screen, making it tough to catch important parts of the film. The videos are interesting enough, but they talk over some key parts of the film, and some of the truly outstanding performances are obscured. Overall, the track is more irritating that it's worth, and I would have preferred a new 1080p documentary to it.<br /><br />************<br /><br />If you don't already own this, buy it. Just buy. Don't think. It's amazing, and an absolute must-own. Any of the above issues will not really matterto someone who doesn't own another edition. This one will do just fine.<br /><br />If you do already have the more recent DVD edition, this is a tough recommendation. The picture quality is certainly better. There is more detail, better black levels, and fewer artifacts such as jagged edges and edge enhancement. But you're going to get a cropped image that may not square well (so to speak) with your recollection of the film you've seen before. And you'll be missing out on the classic trailer, in exchange for yet another superfluous documentary. So it's not really an upgrade. It's more of a lateral move from the DVD.<br /><br />I still give the disc 4 stars. The film is 5-star material all the way. The BD presentation has some serious flaws, but it still is highly watchable and has a fair amount of value.ave the more recent DVD edition, this is a tough recommendation.

B001MYIXAC|5.0|Reviewers like to tell you whether a movie is good or not, and whether they liked it or not.<br /><br />But you want to know whether you'd like it...or not. Why should you care what I think, unless you know our tastes are the same? And you certainly don't want all the surprises in the film ruined for you.<br /><br />So I'll try to help you decide whether to see this or not, without spoiling anything.<br /><br />\\"Let the Right One In\\" is, above all, a serious movie. The concept, the plotting, the cinematography, the casting...everything serves a serious purpose--something like a meditation on what it means to have to take others' lives to keep your own...and what it means to know someone in this position. Of course none of us are, or know, vampires, but at the deepest level we have all taken advantage of others to help ourselves in some way at some time. Except my spouse, who's a saint, of course, just in case she reads this!<br /><br />There's also the moral complexity that comes with the fact that many people who do great wrong to others often have a tender side. The family man who's a serial killer, the concentration camp commander who's a great father to his own children, the poet/dictator. Others are just monsters 24x7, but most have some redeeming traits. And such people are far more interesting than the Leatherfaces of the world. Even Saddam Hussein wrote poetry and doted on this children.<br /><br />There is enough violence in \\"Let the Right One In\\" to justify an R rating, but none is gratuitous, and much is off-screen, in the manner of a good Hitchcock suspense movie, rather than some gorefest. The blood you see is there for good reasons, not just to shock you or titillate you.<br /><br />It was done on a low budget by Hollywood standards. The sparse special effects are good enough to advance the plot but they aren't going to wow you by themselves. The actors are not Hollywood-beautiful, though I think the casting is perfect.<br /><br />The main characters are children--more or less--but it's not a film for children (unless they're unusually deep children, if you know what I mean).<br /><br />It's also not a film for those whose moviegoing expectations are entirely based on big-budget Hollywood movies.<br />I'm not criticizing such movies--I've seen many & loved many--but this ain't that.<br /><br />In particular, many moviegoers want everything explained. This film doesn't do that. It explains nothing, actually. Not because the director wanted to keep you in the dark...but because a lot in life goes unexplained. Someone cuts you off on the freeway, nearly killing you, then vanishes into the night. You never know why he did that, and you'll never learn why. There were reasons, but you're not privy to them.<br /><br />That's what this film delivers. Mostly you see things through the perspective of a 12 year old boy, and rarely know more than he knows. And the children in the film don't deliver long speeches explaining what they're up to, why they're the way they are, yada yada.<br /><br />One reviewer hated this film because nothing is explained. He couldn't accept the fact that not all kids are highly self-aware extroverted, eloquent chatterboxes. \\"Where did you go?\\" \\"Out.\\" \\"What did you do?\\" \\"Nothin'.\\"<br /><br />These kids are average kids in non-average circumstances. So are the adults and other kids around them.<br /><br />You might also be disappointed if you're looking for a hero to a admire and a villain to boo. This film has neither.<br /><br />I loved the TV series \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" and \\"Angel.\\" Those have heroes, and their stories are the stories of the hero's journey. Their central characters are physically beautiful, their dialog is witty and knowledgable and often poetic. And the production values (after Buffy's first two seasons, which were shot in grainy 16mm) are great for late '90s TV. However, \\"Let the Right one in\\" is really, really different from these shows, and I'm sure it's equally different from Twilight.<br /><br />Actually, it's a gritty, realistic vampire film, oxymoronic as that may sound. The closest equivalent to it that I can recall is the underrated Jude Law film \\"The wisdom of crocodiles.\\" Or, more distantly, the Japanese TV anime show \\"Vampire Princess Miyu.\\"<br /><br />Finally, a word about the casting. The 12 year old boy is the whitest white boy I've ever seen this side of an albino. He perfectly embodies the quirky loner he portrays. The girl is also perfect, and while she's not Hollywood-pretty by any stretch, she has huge, hypnotic eyes--almost like the kids in those wretched Keane paintings you see at tourist art galleries, next to the clowns and seascapes. I couldn't think of any child actor today or earlier who could play this crucial part better. She's as well suited to this part as Peta Wilson was to playing La Femme Nikita in the eponymous TV series.<br /><br />The working-class Swedes around them look the part perfectly as well.<br /><br />The film isn't set in any beautiful urban setting, like you'd find in downtown Oslo or Gothenburg. It's set in a sea of utilitarian apartment blocks in a nondescript town, with the action taking place entirely in a Swedish winter. It's the beauty of bleak.<br /><br />I loved this film myself, but I don't want you to get it or watch it unless what I've said here suits you. If you do buy it, please manage the expectations of those you see it with. The pace is generally slow by Hollywood terms--necessary to generate the needed atmospherics. However, the story is linear, and ultimately not obscure at all except for not explaining how the people you see got there in the first place. So it's not hard to follow at least.<br /><br />It has now been several days since I saw this with my brother, who had the same feelings about it as I did. The film has stuck with me. You know how some films you see then forget the instant the screen goes dark? This isn't one of those. It's haunting.  I didn't actually figure out the true nature of the two central characters' relationship until the next day, after the film had percolated through my brain for a while. I won't say what that is, since I promised no spoilers. But it will send chills up your spine.<br /><br />And here's one moment to look for. You know how vampires can't enter your home unless you invite them in? (hence the title of this movie BTW) Watch what happens in this movie when that rule is tested. You'll remember this scene for the rest of your life, and I'm not talking about gore.<br /><br />UPDATE December 21, 2011<br /><br />This small-scale masterpiece has stuck with me in the two years since I first saw it. And now there's an American version of the novel as well, titled \\"Let Me In.\\" I'm glad it has a different title, because I believe both films will be around for a long time, and they shouldn't be confused with each other.<br /><br />Seeing \\"Hugo\\" last weekend reminded me of the American version, since both have Chloe Grace Moretz in them. Being a sociologist by training, I'm fascinated by both the critical and consumer responses to the two movies. More people have seen \\"Let Me In,\\" as you'd expect, but \\"Let the Right One In\\" continues to have stout defenders.<br /><br />In fact we now have Team Abby, Team Eli, and Team Can't We All Be Friends? I'm in the third one. I own both movies, I love both movies, and I think each is better than the other in certain things. Yet I've seen people write that one version or the other appalls them, or even disgusts them. Some have accused the director of one of the films of being a criminal for certain details in the film. And I'm appalled at so much ranting going on about two fine films that aren't in competition with each other.<br /><br />After all, most serious filmgoers have seen more than one version of a bunch of Shakespeare's plays. I know I have.<br /><br />Oh, and many go on and on about one film or the other being truer to the book. Why does that matterin the slightest? It presumes that the book is perfect, and that, moreover, screen adaptations can't bring anything to the party--their only job is to provide animated illustrations for the book. I find this absurd.<br /><br />For example, \\"West Side Story\\" radically reconfigures \\"Romeo and Juliet.\\" So does Zeferelli's (it's less obvious, but it does). Does that automatically invalidate each movie in favor of some BBC bare stage production delivers the exact text of the original? Of course not. And the novel \\"2001\\" is dry and obvious, while Kubrick's movie is majestic and inexplicit--and a great work of art, while the book is just a crutch for those who want everything spelled out for them in plodding prose.<br /><br />The Rottentomatoes website aggregates critics' reviews of films, as well as reader responses. \\"Let the Right One In\\" garnered a 98% critical ranking, while \\"Let Me In\\" got a still very respectable 89%. Thinking about how \\"Let the Right One In\\" has stuck with me over these two years, I'm changing my own rating of the film from four to five stars.<br /><br />The only place I fault \\"Let the Right One In\\" is, in fact, a place where it's truer to the book than the American version is. I can't discuss it without spoilers, so stop now if you haven't seen both movies (unless you've read the novel)<br /><br />-- SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT -- SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT --<br /><br />In the book Eli is a castrated boy originally named Elias. I haven't read the book myself, but I know this is true. \\"Let the Right One In\\" sticks to this, with a brief crotch shot of Eli (about as sexy as someone stepping on your foot) that makes the point. People on Team Eli claim that this is required to explain Eli's lack of interest in sex, and in Eli telling Oskar \\"I'm not a girl.\\"<br /><br />Fine, that's the novel. But if it were really going to be true for the movie, they'd have had to cast an adrogynous boy--not Lina Leandersson. She may not look like a young Ingrid Bergman, as Ms. Moretz does in \\"Let Me In,\\" but she is distinctly female--in her looks, in her voice, in her motions. Prepubescent boys and girls resemble each other far more than pubescent ones do, but they still look different. Very few are exactly androgynous, and Ms. Leandersson ain't one of them--and it's an insult to her to claim that she looks like a boy. And no, it's not the girl's hairdo.<br /><br />So neither movie is really true to the novel.<br /><br />And in \\"Let Me In,\\" when Chloe Moretz's character tells Owen \\"I'm not a girl,\\" there's even less question as to her gender--even though she's a very strong girl who usually does her own stunts in every movie she's in. But then Owen asks her what she is, then, and she hesitates, then says \\"I'm nothing.\\"<br /><br />That's a profound moment in the movie, and I just wish the Swedish version had played it that way. Of course Abby isn't a girl. She's a vampire. And that means she is, indeed \\"nothing.\\"<br /><br />As for Abby/Eli's disinterest in sex...hello, they're 12. It doesn't matter how long they've been 12, their human biology is and will remain on the other side of puberty as long as they, um, un-live. Most 12 year old girls--even when they aren't vampires--are not interested in sex.<br /><br />Honestly, when I watch \\"Let the Right One In\\" I view Eli as a girl because she's played by a girl. You want her a boy? Have a boy play the part. There are certainly androgynous boy actors out there. But don't tell me the Swedish version is true to the book and the American version isn't. Neither is true to the book in this regard, and personally I prefer it this way--it makes for a better film IMHO, and I put it to you that both directors think the sam as I do, given their casting choices.<br /><br />Some reviews say Eli being a boy means Eli's relationship with Hakan is chaste. To which I say not on Hakan's part. He isn't 12. Whether they're having sex or not his desire is there, just as Owen's/Oskar's is. And it is whether or not Eli is a boy or a girl, for that matter. Eli/Abby needs a mortal human blood donor (so to speak)/protector who loves her. In our species that includes a lust component along with other things. If it didn't our species wouldn't be here. In this regard Eli's gender makes no difference--though it probably affects her choice of blood donor/day guardian.<br /><br />It also means she can't turn her protector into a vampire. No day guard then, and no hold over him either. And it needs to be a male, because human males are generally stronger, and they need to be stronger in order to hunt for the vampire--who doesn't want to hunt, which again shows how deromanticized this film's vampire mythology is. And I think it needs to be a male who isn't an enthusiastic serial killer, because such people are rarely sufficiently devoted to the well-being of a 12 year old child, vampire or not. It needs to be someone somewhat normal, but alienated--like Oskar/Owen.<br /><br />Note also that Eli's residual humanity shows in her (I think of her as a her) sparing that one kid in the pool scene. I wish the American version had done that. I also thought the climbing up the side of the hospital was visualized better in \\"Let the right one in,\\" and what happens when Eli enters without permission, and in general I prefer the lighter touch \\"Let the Right One In\\" has with violence and CGI. I also prefer the fact that the woman Eli inadvertently turns chooses death when she realizes what she's becoming, while in the American version she just dies like an animal. That was another place where the American version should have imitated the Swedish one and didn't.<br /><br />People argue back & forth about the way the American version cuts out subplots to focus on the protagonists. I'm fine with both choices, personally. Ditto the casting--two perfect pairs in my book. Moretz is going to take Scarlett Johansson's place when she comes of age--someone with true high voltage star power, sharp intelligence, rollicking sense of humor and wonder, a level head, and with action movie skills that means she'll probably wind up doing a blockbuster, then an art film, then a blockbuster, as so many intelligent actors do. I also hope to see Lina Leandersson in more films--you can't forget those haunted and haunting eyes, and the sureness she brings to a very challenging role for a 12 year old actor.<br /><br />Lastly, some reviewers took the crotch shot and the implicit sexuality of the vampire-protector relationship (and, astonishingly, Oskar's frequent toplessness) as signs that the movie is borderline kiddie porn. I find this both appalling and immoral. \\"Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.\\" Publicly accusing someone of a heinous crime is itself a vicious crime unless you can prove it.<br /><br />Back in 2004, several people in Mali were murdered by villagers because someone like these \\"reviewers\\" had spread the rumor that those people were vampires. In this century! And to call that utterly unsexual crotch shot pornographic is idiotic as well as libelous. But some people think about perversions all the time, and see it around every corner, behind every neighbor's eyes. It's a form of paranoia. That's how dozens of people were convicted of involvement in satanic chil abuse rings run out of daycare centers in the 1980. Many of those people were in prison for decades. But eventually every single one of them was found innocent and released. This is not to deny the problem. The turmoil surrounding so many Catholic priests in so many countries shows that sometimes there is fire where there's smoke, to be sure. But sometimes the beam is in the accuser's eye entirely, and that's the case here.<br /><br />Bottom line: \\"Let the Right One In\\" is a great movie. I'd use it to teach classes in film school--especially to show that you don't need a gigantic special effects budget even when you're making a fantasy film, which this is really, despite its realism apartfrom the vampire part. I'd also use it to teach a class in situational ethics as well.<br /><br />So if you haven't bought the DVD yet, please do so. And then get the American version too.claim that she looks like a boy. And no, it's not the girl's hairdo.   So neither movie is really true to the novel.  And in \\"Let Me In,\\" when Chloe Moretz's character tells Owen \\"I'm not a girl,\\" there's even less question as to her gender--even though she's a very strong girl who usually does her own stunts in every movie she's in.

In this regard Eli's gender makes no difference--though it probably affects her choice of blood donor/day guardian.  It also means shecan't turn her protector into a vampire. No day guard then, and no hold over him either. And it needs to be a male, because human males are generally stronger, and they need to be stronger in order to hunt for the vampire--who doesn't want to hunt, which again shows how deromanticized this film's vampire mythology is. And I think it needs to be a male who isn't an enthusiastic serial killer, because such people are rarely sufficiently devoted to the well-being of a 12 year old child, vampire or not. It needs to be someone somewhat normal, but alienated--like Oskar/Owen.  Note also that Eli's residual humanity shows in her (I think of her as a her) sparing that one kid in the pool scene. I wish the American version had done that. I also thought the climbing up the side of the hospital was visualized better in \\"Let the right one in,\\" and what happens when Eli enters without permission, and in general I prefer the lighter touch \\"Let the Right One In\\" has with violence and CGI. I also prefer the fact that the woman Eli inadvertently turns chooses death when she realizes what she's becoming, while in the American version she just dies like an animal. That was another place where the American version should have imitated the Swedish one and didn't.   People argue back & forth about the way the American version cuts out subplots to focus on the protagonists. I'm fine with both choices, personally. Ditto the casting--two perfect pairs in my book. Moretz is going to take Scarlett Johansson's place when she comes of age--someone with true high voltage star power, sharp intelligence, rollicking sense of humor and wonder, a level head, and with action movie skills that means she'll probably wind up doing a blockbuster, then an art film, then a blockbuster, as so many intelligent actors do. I also hope to see Lina Leandersson in more films--you can't forget those haunted and haunting eyes, and the sureness she brings to a very challenging role for a 12 year old actor.   Lastly,some reviewers took the crotch shot and the implicit sexuality of the vampire-protector relationship (and, astonishingly, Oskar's frequent toplessness) as signs that the movie is borderline kiddie porn. I find this both appalling and immoral. \\"Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.\\" Publicly accusing someone of a heinous crime is itself a vicious crime unless you can prove it.  Back in 2004, several people in Mali were murdered by villagers because someone like these \\"reviewers\\" had spread the rumor that those people were vampires. In this century! And to call that utterly unsexual crotch shot pornographic is idiotic as well as libelous. But some people think about perversions all the time, and see it around every corner, behind every neighbor's eyes. It's a form of paranoia. That's how dozens of people were convicted of involvement in satanic chil abuse rings run out of daycare centers in the 1980. Many of those people were in prison for decades. But eventually every single one of them was found innocent and released. This is not to deny the problem. The turmoil surrounding so many Catholic priests in so many countries shows that sometimes there is fire where there's smoke, to be sure. But sometimes the beam is in the accuser's eye entirely, and that's the case here.  Bottom line: \\"Let the Right One In\\" is a great movie. I'd use it to teach classes in film school--especially to show that you don't need a gigantic special effects budget even when you're making a fantasy film, which this is really, despite its realism apart from the vampire part. I'd also use it to teach a class in situational ethics as well.   So if you haven't bought the DVD yet, please do so. And then get the American version too.
B00008OWZC|5.0|I was forunate enough to be at the LA Forum show on 25Jun1972.  It's the best live show I have ever been too. I have attended over a 100 concerts in my life and this one sticks as the best live show ever.  I'm so glad they came out with the CD music from this concert. Now I can listen to the music from that special night again and again.
055358894X|5.0|I'm a relative newcomer to the fantasy genre; as of two years ago the only fantasy I really read was Harry Potter and the occasional Discworld book.  But I then devoured George R.R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire series.  I was ravenous for more fantasy, and grew impatient for Martin to continue his series.  So Scott Lynch's first volume in his Gentlemen Bastard sequence was the next fantasy book I picked up, and boy I wasn't disappointed.    Firstly, the book reads more like a crime caper than a fantasy book.  Locke and his friends pull off many a brilliant con throughout the story, and I enjoyed the flashback format thoroughly between Locke's present-day woes and scenes from his childhood.  There are no 'thous' and 'dosts' in this book; the dialogue is very modern but witty and engaging.    Another strong aspect of the book is the setting and description.  Lynch obviously put a LOT of thought into not only the history, culture and description of Camorr, itself beautifully realized and almost a character in and of itself, but into all of the Therin city states like Emberlain, Karthain, and many others that are just mentioned in passing.  Just reading about Camorr and descriptions of different groups and cultural traditions in it is just as fascinating as the exploits of Locke et al.      The story and characters are both solid, and some of the twists are very surprising.  Lynch does not shy away from violence and tormenting and even killing major characters, which even adds more to the drama.  Locke and Jean are especially well realized as is his mentor, the priest Chains, and the villainous Gray King.  My one complaint is that many aspects of Locke's past remain, intentionally, unrevealed.  While I understand the point of this is presumably to have more flashback content for future installments in the series, it in a way takes away from the development of Locke's character and I would wished, if nothing else, to see more about his mysterious love interest who apparently played a major role in his life and yet we never see her, both in flashback and present day.    All in all though, Lynch delivers a solid, entertaining story that as I mentioned isn't so much fantasy (though there are magical elements and nasty creatures) as it is a simply thrilling crime/adventure story.  I've moved onto many other fantasy series since yet found nothing even close to Lies of Locke Lamora.  Truly unique, can't wait for more.
B001IKKMCW|4.0|I love the movie, for me, this is Jim Carrey's best movie, no doubt. The Blu-Ray looks superb, both audio & video,  really enjoyed it. ENJOY !!!

B00243FQFA|3.0|as it was said earlier on in the begining, it wasnt expected to live up to it's sister series and go past more than 5 season's, but neither the less, it was still a good season with some odd and ends in there and some very awesome episodes, lets hope the new SGA movie Exstinction as it's titled it goona be good and that there will be more to come, as with Stargate Universe (SGU) starting soon lets hope thats as good
B000FZETIO|2.0|How can they call this Everything's Duckie if they aren't going to have the original ending on this DVD?  Me and my best girlfriend bonded over the fact that we couldn't believe that Andy ran off with Blaine (Blaine, he was like the wallpaper, he was so boring) instead of being with Duckie. I tend to watch the film right up until the end and then just turn it off.    When they release the film on DVD with the original ending of Andy and Duckie together, only then will I buy the DVD.     The soundtrack I don't need, I have that for years.  Was a big New Order long before, didn't really like Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark.  Left of Center (Suzanne Vega/Joe Jackson) was my life story in high school.  Oh the memories.
B0024FAG1W|4.0|Blue Thunder is one of my favorite movies of all time. Seeing this movie on Blu-Ray is like watching it for the very first time. I saw this movie in the theatre back in the early 80's, on VHS and standard DVD, this Blu-Ray is no question the best I've seen. Both audio and video were much improved. For me, this is definitely Roy Scheider's best film ( I like JAWS, too ). If you're a big fan of \\"Blue Thunder\\" like myself, then I highly recommend that you get this movie on Blu-Ray. ENJOY !!!
0920668364|1.0|After several recommendations from friends, we got this book and started reading it.  The first half was pleasant enough and fairly touching.  In the latter half, this book turns downright creepy and it's like a screenplay for a horror movie.  A grown man with separation anxiety?  Good grief!  I think this would traumatize children everywhere and it is unbelievable that people like this book at all.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Very clean movie. No cussing. No using God's name in vain. Lots of action (but a little boring at the very beginning of the movie). Good message of what will happen if humans don't take care of the earth.

B00127RAJY|3.0|I will admit, this is one tough workout, but I wasn't looking for easy.  I had read a review talking about how she liked jumping jacks...and she does.  I have lower back and knee problems and so I'm not allowed to run for exercise and I'm not supposed to do any jarring exercises, but I was able to replace those movements in level one with less impact, equal calories burn exercises.  After two weeks, I felt like I had mastered level 1 well enough to move to level 2.  Level is has a lot of jumping/twisting moves in it.  Even some of the beginner modifications are not good for someone like me.  I haven't checked out level 3 yet, but I may just have to stick to level one (which is still a good workout).  My recommendation is if you are someone like me who has knee or back issues, you might want to try something else.
044024367X|2.0|I've read quite a few Reacher novels and some were better than others but they all had a base level of quality that was very high. The streak is broken with this one. It starts off promising enough as Reacher is caught between a helpful sheriff in one town and a strange conspiracy in another. However the conspiracy and villains surrounding it are so undefined and lame that you don't really care about them or feel any sense of urgency.    Yes Childs does insert some of his political and religious beliefs into this novel. I didn't really find it that out of place, except for a few times when it got a little too much like preaching then real dialogue for my tastes. Even if I share many of the same views as the author I still don't appreciate it when anyone tries to enlighten us with their views in a form of entertainment.    It basically drags big time in the middle with Reacher romping back and forth between these two towns, almost aimlessly. Then it switches back to a pretty tepid romance for a while, long after you're bored with that aspect it will rush back into the main plot cramming in way too much stuff in the last 50 or so pages. They have multiple things all wrapping up at the same time all of the way too neat, and most of them feel included just so Childs could make his points on religion and Iraq.    Not the abomination others are claiming, but I definitely feel like it wasn't worth the time spent. Hopefully this is not a sign of things to come for the series.

And each of these videos is a masterpeice. Childhood, Stranger in Moscow, Smooth Criminal and Earth Song are just astounding. You can watch them again and again and never get tired of them...they're candy for your eyes. You just don't see many vidoes on this caliber. And the MTV video music award performance is unparalleled. Would highly recommend this!
1416562605|4.0|Aravind Adiga's debut novel weaves a tale of life as seen through the eyes of a criminal.Here we encounter the struggle between the classes;the poor against the rich;the lower against the upper caste.We are exposed to the real India-beneath all the television adverts,democratic ideals and somewhat inchoate industrialisation,crime,theft,nepotism and thuggery hold sway.At times one cannot help but feel sorry for the main protagonist and the circumstance in which he has found himself.The beauty of this book is in its telling.Mr Adiga's  acerbic wit exposes itself in every line and at times even the most unpleasant aspects of the story are made bearable.Here there is no linguistic sophistication or redudandancy of words.Leaving us with a book that takes us through the journey of a  man's  life and the choices he had to make to become a success.

They just keep getting better and better with each album in my opinion.

0307269981|5.0|i don't think you'll be able to take this book quite as seriously as the first because the plot is a bit contrived and the author seems to have a fairly set agenda that is a bit squishy:  the main characters/protagonists have fairly open and very liberal sex lives and beliefs while the bad guys are involved in, gasp, prostitution.  And yet, really, you get the feeling that the bad guys are made to be so ultra creepy that it gives our little Lisbeth license to go out and beat the hell out of them with tasers and guns and knives and other devices.  And I have to admit that every time she took the bad guys on, I got those great goose bump and little tears in the eyes moments that make this such a fun read.  I don't want to give much more of the story away, but I found the book to be a much lighter and faster read than the first book.  I'll bet he wrote it in less than 1/2 the time as Tattoo.<br /><br />So, five stars is pushing it.  But when a character is created that you'll love the rest of your life and certain scenes are burned into your psyche forever, you can easily justify five stars.  This book is an R rated plus book.  Too bad we have to wait so long for the final book of the trilogy.
B000KJU1MS|5.0|Gene, Paul, Peter, and Ace - the original KISS in arguably their best period - the earliest. It all culminates in the Love Gun era, giving us the band at their peak in terms of music, look, and popularity. Just before they became 'Ringling Brothers' and sank into self-parody (and later obscurity).    The shows and the songs you can't argue with. What you can argue with is that for guys who keep boldly asserting they have this unbelievable archive of stuff no one's ever seen before they choose to only show us footage that's circulated as bootleg for years (I've heard lol). This wouldn't even be so bad if they didn't then truncate the footage. I mean, why buy shows that are missing songs when you probably already have the full show at home?    But these guys know their fans buy EVERYTHING they put their name on anyway. Still I would have liked more stuff I hadn't seen before and the 'bonus disc' is just a cheap ploy to make you buy it more than once to get all 3 (I didn't, but I'm sure someone did!).    Still, the footage is awesome and certainly in the best quality you'll EVER see it!
192076920X|5.0|Great entertainment.  He is a fantastic author, with his wealth of real experience I think he is one of the best writers of our time.  Every chapter has a new unexpected plot twist or fascinating insight and I highly recommend this book.  I'm very curious if he can produce something as intense with his next book.    As for the travel writing aspects of the book, he does glamorize a group of westerners basically not doing anything more productive in Mumbai than committing petty crimes, but his knowledge of the local language, personalities and daily life are the strong points of the book and more than make up for that.   A mumbai madarrchod I know related a few stories of local gangsters that are very similar to the book.      I also recommend the first hand narrative 'maximum city' which describes the city from a few other angles as well but is not quite the pageturner that Shantaram is.    After reading about the slums I do wish overseas indian billionaires would donate money to help education back home rather than give it to ivy league universities that have no need.  anyone have any ideas how to make that happen?
0143038419|3.0|i liked the book but what pissed me off is that she never mentioned with sympathy in what bad conditions people live in India and Indonesia, especially women, though she represented herself as a such kind, loving and generous person. she praised herself throughout the whole book.
B001PPLIEG|3.0|Don't give a license to kill to a man on a vengeance quest.  A wounded Bond, stripped of his cool detachment, is a very dangerous agent.  Bond fell in love in [[ASIN:B000MNP2KI Casino Royale]] - the kinetic and intense reboot of the series - and his lover betrayed him and then died violently while he watched helplessly.  He needs revenge and closure.  There's no quantum of solace for a mourning and betrayed Bond.<br /><br />The task of this film, it seems, is to bring Daniel Craig's headstrong and impetuous James Bond to some kind of middle ground with the suave, martini drinking, womanizing, calm and collected and deliberate Bond we'd come to know and love (or hate).  He needs therapy, but Bond doesn't do therapy.  He's got to exorcise his demons in a much more practical and ruthless fashion.  The closest he gets to a therapist is with Olga Kurylenko's Camille, whose own revenge quest gives the relentless Bond an occasion to reflect upon what he really wants to achieve, and helps him to move on when he's done.<br /><br />This is mostly satisfying, though there are several odd and undeveloped moments.  Gemma Arterton plays a woman from the embassy, who is expected to detain the fugitive Bond after he'd violently escaped from a whole slew of highly trained agents.  It's pretty implausible that anyone who knew anything about Bond would think she could detain him -- except perhaps through her feminine charms, but she does absolutely nothing to seduce him and merely smiles when she is seduced and then puts up hardly any resistance when he refuses to stay in the hotel room.  She exists in the film for no other reason that I can discern than simply that everyone expects Bond will seduce somebody in a Bond film -- and he betrays next to no sexual interest in Camille (he breaks off quickly from a single kiss).<br /><br />What bugged me the most about this film is the editing, especially during the action sequences.  The filmmakers were aiming for something akin to [[ASIN:B000VWYJ86 The Bourne Ultimatum]], but instead of achieving a kinetic flow of action, they seemed merely to chop it up to the point of virtual incoherence.  In Bourne it is the documentary style camera work - that feels as if the action is being captured as it occurs, as if there is an inherent unpredictability to the action - that necessitates a more dynamic and unconventional editing style.  Here it felt like they had filmed things in the ordinary way and then chopped things up to create a simulacrum of the dynamic flow in the Bourne films.  It didn't work.  To pull it off with this kind of footage they needed to work more on a rhythm of anticipation and fulfillment, a balance of establishing moments and interruptions into action. I couldn't discern a clear rationale for why they sustained certain (rare) moments (very briefly) and other moments they cut through so quickly they could barely be registered.  The ordering of shots made some sense, but the pacing and rhythm struck me as fairly arbitrary.  During the action scenes especially, when I should have been engaged, I found myself distracted, counting out how long the cuts were and wishing for more sustained moments, rather than paying attention to the story and the action.<br /><br />Daniel Craig still managed to pull of the character in a convincing fashion, and Judi Dench continued to prove she was the right choice for M; Olga Kurylenko held her own opposite Craig as something much more than merely a \\"Bond girl,\\" as did several supporting characters -- such as the excellent Matthieu Amalric as the villian.

068484267X|5.0|Angela's Ashes has been compared to A Portrait of the Artist as a Young man. Frank McCourt's book helped me understand Catholic absurdity and contradiction more so than James Joyce's book.  I loved both books equally, but Angela's Ashes struck a cord with me.  At an early age an Irish youngster has the priest preaching hellfire and eternal damnation for the slightest wayward thought.  Then, when the child grows into a young man, on his knees, depressed to near mental anguish and mental illness about a feared sin, the priest says, \\"Oh--no, God forgives you\\", and \\"you need to forgive yourself\\".  Suddenly, the friend who died isn't in hell, she's in heaven after all.  Absurd Catholic contradiction.    Membership in the Catholic church is dwindling.  As long as Irish authors such as Frank McCourt and James Joyce use their writing to state their case, I predict more Catholics will exit in mass from the pews.    What Ashes?  Where were the Ashes?  What did Ashes have to do with the book?    The perverted little treats written into the story on the last 62 pages may sell books, but I've never seen teenage boys or men do the things McCourt and Joyce suggest.
0312427999|4.0|I read this book after strong recommendations by academic colleagues teaching our International Business degree programme.  While I found it fascinating, the use of hyperbole and an occasional lack of rigour places this book squarely in the realms of a polemic rather than a credible critical or political analysis.  As a polemic, it pushes all the right buttons and provides a wealth of sources to support the many claims that are made.<br /><br />One key strength of the book is the international coverage, and the depth of the discussions from all parts of the world.  Snippets from personal visits and interviews lend a level of drama and realism, but the kind of rigour expected in academic studies is not present in this work.  If I were judging this book wholly on readability and contribution to contemporary debates, it would surely get five-stars.  It is a long overdue examination of the risible claim that US-style democracy is being spread peacefully around the world.  The central thesis, ably articulated, is that free-markets have had anti-democratic impacts in every state where they have been deployed.  Klein's argument is at its most powerful in discussions of Poland, Russia and South Africa.  In Poland, she describes the mass support for restructuring state industries as worker cooperatives, only to be ignored by overseas \\"aid\\" agencies determined to force through privitisation plans (halted and partially reversed after elections swept the Solidarity movement leadership from power and reintroduced some measure of democracy).  In Russia, she sets out how the will of elected representatives was - quite literally - shot to pieces when the military enforced the suspension of parliament.  This left behind a Yeltsin dictatorship advised by US free-marketeers in all aspects of economic policy, resulting in the Russian oligarchs and a mafia-controlled business sector.  In South Africa, Klein describes how joining international financial institutions made it impossible for politicians to deliver their promises for land reform and an economy based on cooperative enterprise.  The blatant opportunism of the IMF and World Bank, and their complicity working with defenders of aparteid, is described in detail and fully exposed.  The naivity of South Africa's newly elected negotiators is shocking, tragic and gripping in equal measure, contributing to the most unjust international \\"aid\\" of the century.<br /><br />As Klein convincingly argues, the democratic will of elected representatives was crushed in each of these (and other) countries to pursue an anti-democratic ideology based on a global free-market.  She describes the unholy trinity of the IMF, World Bank and US corporations who collaborated in the removal or subversion of democratic politics around the global.  As such, the book provides a new level of insight into the coordination between various international authorities supporting mass-exploitation directly opposed to democratic rule and makes a worthwhile contribution of lasting value.  Particularly heartening is the final chapter (\\"Shock Wears Off\\") which indicates the collapsing influence of the IMF, World Bank and USA amongst South American countries.  Around the world institutions are being developed to end the era of lassez-faire economics.<br /><br />So where does the book fall down?  As other authors have pointed out, there is a clear political bias to the writing that will please some and attract the condemnation from others.  This, for me, was not the biggest flaw.  Rather, it was the carelessness of some claims that retrospectively fits 'facts' to theory, rather than developing theory from 'facts'.  Secondly, there is no full consideration of the debates surrounding the impact 9/11.  The author, incredibly bold in setting out the influence of US corporates and the US government outside the USA, is much more inhibited about developments within the USA itself.  Having set out that Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld effectively declared \\"war\\" on the Pentagon (with the goal of ending US-style \\"central planning\\"), it is staggering that the author ignores both international debate and USA court cases that claim that 9/11 was itself part of the very 'shock therapy' that is central to the book's thesis.  Perhaps this was a step too far for the publisher?  Lastly, the loose use of important words and concepts by the author weakens its intellectual stature.  For example, 'postmodern' management is linked to Friedman's free-market ideology: this is a profound misreading of the political assumptions of 'postmodernism', as well as the way postmodernism is affecting the study and practice of management.<br /><br />These gripes aside, I unreservedly recommmend this book.  An updated edition that considers the 2008 / 2009 banking collapse in light of the book's central thesis would surely be another best seller.  Are we witnessing the boldest attempt yet at Shock Therapy, or - as John Gray argues - the final nail in the coffin of global laissez-faire?<br /><br />I, for one, would be interested in this author's view.<br /><br />Rory Ridley-Duff (Dr)<br />Senior Lecturer<br />Sheffield Hallam Universityhe Pentagon (with the goal of ending US-style \\"central planning\\"), it is staggering that the author ignores both international debate and USA court cases that claim that 9/11 was itself part of the very 'shock therapy' that is central to the book's thesis.

B00005JLPK|5.0|Selma Hayek is awesome as Frida Kahlo in this beautifully told story of this phenomenal artists life. Marrying to her womanizing lover Diego Sanchez really helped fuel the emotional distress that artists require to create with such intensity. As if her damaged physical state wasn't enough, the heart ache of her wandering lover helped push her over the top in my opinion and fueled what became a lifetime of masterpieces.    This story is warm, sad, funny and inspiring and it would seem that Selma had a great deal of respect for the woman she portrays so well in this work of art on film. By far and away the best movie I have seen to date, If the dialogue alone doesn't do it for you then certainly the set of 1930's Mexico City will. Rich and beautiful in all arena's: sound, site, time period and ideological social sub-cultures.    On a scale of 1 - 10 I give this film a 55

There is only one King Of Rock N Roll and that is Elvis Presley, get that suit of this trash bag ho before she insults his legacy just by wearing it.  Britney Spears is a manufactured, no talent, hack,  Elvis is The King there is a huge difference and why he got to wear his trademark suit.  Britney is nothing and this is an insult to Elvis, britney would maybe qualify as one of the King's groupies maybe.....thats as far as it goes.

MJ was the greatest innovator in the industry, during his beginnings as an adult performer. I wish the young people of today, had not listened to all the negatives and become opinionated concerning this great performer. It's too bad that they couldn't learn to be entertained without having to be cursed and told how great it is to be a thug and user of drugs, etc.WE WILL ALWAYS LOVE HIM.

0385340575|5.0|I picked up this book with a happy sigh and the same thought I usually have when opening a Lee Child book, \\"ahh, pure pleasure awaits!\\"  And from the first paragraph:  \\"Suicide bombers are easy to spot.  They give out all kinds of tell-tale signs.  Mostly because they're nervous.  By definition they're all first-timers,\\" one is plunged into the world of Jack Reacher, at once scary, exhilarating and, always, exciting.    The setting is a normally innocuous one:  a New York subway train, at 2:00 AM, on which Reacher finds himself with no particular destination in mind.  Reacher, to the uninitiated, is an itinerant, heroic ex-soldier and -MP always ready for anything.  His attention is caught by a woman who, to his trained eye, exhibits all the classic signs.  The refrain known to all NYers after September 11th is \\"If you see something, say something.\\"  I quickly learned more than I ever wanted to know about the \\"behavioral indicators\\" of a would-be martyr.  Any more details on the story line would constitute a spoiler, because the suspense starts on page 1 and doesn't let up till the final page, sometimes abating slightly, and briefly.  There are layers upon layers, with always another twist, another surprise, ahead.    One of the things at which the author excels is making entirely plausible to the reader the usually incredible.  All the while caught up in writing witty and wonderful, deft, swift-moving and sure, with just the right amount of leavening humor.  Characters and situations are introduced in succinct manner, telling you all you need to know.  The same could be said for the book as a whole.  Reacher is a man who famously travels light, no backpacks or any other kind of luggage, only what he can fit into his pockets, \\"\\"everything I need, nothing I don't.\\"  Exactly what Mr. Child gives the reader.  It is, obviously, highly recommended.
B00008G9JN|5.0|Songs From the Wood - (1977)  11 Tracks (2 bonus) ****½  (53:03)<br /><br />Now this is some real Prog-Folk music!  Far from the blues based rock these guys started out with from the early days.  The album starts off with Ian's a cappella voice and continues on just as one would expect from a bunch of medieval, codpiece wearing minstrels.  But, at the same time, much of this album begins to rock out with plenty of electric guitar riffing, sprinkled with acoustic guitar and flute.<br /><br />I think the best two songs are the title track and Hunting Girl.  With Jack-in-the-Green, Cup of Wonder, and Velvet Green coming in a close second.  Songs From the Wood is an over-all nice listen as there are really no bad songs that I would consider \\"filler\\" on here.  This remastered version contains two bonus tracks, Beltrane and a live version of Velvet Green recorded by the BBC in Concert from 1977. Four and half stars rounded up to five.  A recommended addition to your Jethro Tull collection.
1416594884|5.0|The first John LeCarre that Ive read was Our Game. His characters in that book get tremblingly jealous, nauseatingly vengeful, furiously indignant. The protagonist himself is languishing on moral dilemmas. I have read Constant Gardener, Tailor of Panama, Absolute Friends since, Our Game remains his strongest for me... until this one.      Some people, as with Absolute Friends and Constant Gardener, would probably dislike the book for its ending. Lecarre could have wrapped it up differently by revising just the last 20 page, and the book will sell a couple of hundred thousands more, but LeCarre chooses the most plausible ending that he thinks happen today (same case for his the books I mentioned above). It's his own little way to fan the ember of activism and the reader's awareness/alertness on what's currently happening and the actual issues in global politics.     Even if you don't like spycraft stories and the political underpinnings in the book, you will still enjoy the very human characters. They are brilliantly framed, most probably rigorously pre-studied. And the drama is taut. This book is guaranteed worth your while.     To us who work 8am to 8pm, we cant really hope to finish a novel anymore in one week. Much less, expect to start it. But how LeCarre weaves real breathing people will take you to finish a book once you started. The tension is always there even without the gunfights and explosions. Last 75 pages especially are fire-y, frenzy.
B0016BPWNM|5.0|Sarah (Jennifer Connelly) is a young teenage girl with a new step-mom, step-brother and a lot of angst. When she's stuck at home babysitting the kid, she wishes him away to the goblins only to have that wish come true.  She's got to negotiate the labyrinth to get the baby back from Goblin King Jareth (David Bowie) before mid-night or the kid's forfeit.      This film combines the talents of so many wonderful people.  Jim Henson of Muppet fame provided the puppets and direction, plus wrote the story.  It's fairy tale and moral as well and beautifully done.  I never got to see this film in the theatres when it first came out, but Blu-Ray at last does this masterpiece justice.  One of my all-time favorites, beautifully rendered and well worth the price.     Rebecca Kyle, August 2009
B001MEJY8W|5.0|Martrys is nothing like I thought it would be. It's not so much a horror movie as a psychological thriller. To be honest, I haven't watched a movie that put me on edge like this in a long time. It's clearly not for the faint of heart, there is alot blood and gore. But the setup, plot and acting in the movie itself is incredible. It's defintely not predictable which is a relief to see with movies today. That being said, if you can't deal with the gore or torture, don't see it! Movies like this aren't for everyone. And it is not torture porn at all as I have heard it described. There is nothing remotely sexual in this movie. No rape, no sex, nothing. The movie explains why women are chosen. And the word martyrs does not only apply to people who willingly give their life for a cause, but also derives from the greek word Witness. So bare in mind through this whole movie, none of the girls are willing to be there, they are just there to bare witness. That's all I can say without giving the movie away. So if you can deal with physical violence, please see this movie. I gurantee you haven't seen anything like it and it's a brilliant film.
B00005YT8U|4.0|Throughout their long careers, the Chieftains continually surprised their fans with the collaborations they'd create.  Everyone from the Rolling Stones doing a rollicking version of \\"Rocky Road to Dublin\\" to Ziggy Marley's version of his Dad's \\"Redemption Song\\" are here.      This collection's not all jollity. Of course, you've got the deeper more thoughtful songs like \\"Magdalene Laundries\\" by Joni Mitchell, which details the forced servitude of 'fallen women' controlled by the Catholic Church in Ireland. There's also the haunting \\"Foggy Dew\\" by Sinead O'Connor.     Probably my favorite song of the whole bunch, if it's possible to have one, is \\"Morning Has Broken\\" with Art Garfunkel.  His pure voice intermixed with the strings is one of the most beautiful sounds I've ever heard.      If you don't own any Chieftains and want a good sampling of their work, this collection's a good start. If you're like me and do own a lot of their music, it's still good to have this collection to put on as a collection of varietal music.    Rebecca Kyle, August 2009

B000LXH0AE|4.0|The premise of this movie is so unique and all of the acting is terrific.

It's now one of my top 25 favorite movies of all time.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|No need to say anything about the movies; for me, a huge LOTR fan, this is just the best cinematic trilogy ever. This is about the blu-ray transfer. There are people who did not like it, and this for two reasons: 1) It does not look better than the DVD. This is simply not true. I have played both Coppola restorations in the same player and TV, and the difference between the upgraded DVD and the Blu-Ray is huge. The quality of the image in Blu-Ray is just mind-blowing (at least in this US edition). 2) It is grainy. This one is true, and yet, I have seen more grain in very recent movies. And, after all, it is the original grain of the celluloid, not some DNR artifact, so it is actually cinematographically great to see it; it is the way the director and photographer intended it to look. If you want pristine grainless clarity, forget about this one (and yet, it is not that grainy...I was surprised to see so little of it after having read some grain-haters reviews), but if you want to watch it as good as, or proably better, than in cinemas, this is it.
B00004RVHP|4.0|The video was very good.  However I would have liked to have known that it was German.  The subtitles were all in German, so when they spoke French or Spanish, I couldn't understand.  Other than that the video was excellent.     The service from Amazon was excellent, I could not fault it.
1594202249|5.0|Pynchon's books are recognizable because of their common elements--a quest story, a world populated by individuals with tag names that are often comic, an omnipresent sense of connectedness that implies either bona fide connectedness or paranoia, a deep awareness of both scientific and technical detail and the elements of contemporary popular culture.  The resulting mix carries with it a sense of foreboding that is simultaneously comic and can be, literally, funny.  The overall effect is one of bemusement at the world or fear of it or bemusement as an instrument to mitigate the fear.<br /><br />Inherent Vice fits that template precisely and the effects are doubled by the fact that Pynchon is working in the California PI tradition established by the Black Mask writers and codified most precisely by Raymond Chandler in his essay, \\"The Simple Art of Murder.\\"  Here, Larry \\"Doc\\" Sportello, a 60's doper/PI is investigating the disappearance of a land developer who has become involved with Doc's former girl friend.  As he investigates the case he discovers the tentacles connecting the land developer, his bodyguards, the LAPD, Vegas gamblers, the developer's antagonists and a ship/organization called the Golden Fang, which may be the pivotal element in a huge drug operation or a tax dodge for a group of dentists.<br /><br />If you read \\"The Simple Art of Murder,\\" principally its conclusion with the discussion of the Chandlerian hero and the mean streets down which he must go, you see immediately the connections with Inherent Vice, for Doc most go down some pretty mean streets; he must carry the narrative and he will discover the connectedness which, for Chandler, involved the corruption that both inheres in and links the core institutions of society: crime, business, the police, unions, et al.  Thus, Inherent Vice is both uniquely Pynchonesque and, simultaneously, Chandleresque.<br /><br />The time frame is the end of the 1960's and the setting is Gordita Beach, a fictional location which most would link with Manhattan Beach, Pynchon's personal residence at that time.  While the details of Pynchon's personal life are closely guarded, some reminiscences of his neighbors and landlord have surfaced and there is a sense that the book is autobiographical, not in its specific details but in the sense that his memories of and feelings for that time are warm and the book has helped him to relive them.<br /><br />The book is a relatively fast read with a straightforward plot (by Pynchon's standards).  It is, overall, more upbeat (like, e.g. Vineland), with sunshine penetrating the shadows.  The title refers to a term used to describe the fundamental, unavoidable issues that attend the shipping of cargo and is imaginatively linked with what believers would call original sin.  The overall conclusions are more `specific' than Pynchon is sometimes willing to provide, but vaguer than readers of crime fiction will usually expect, but as the publisher notes, this was a time when the smoke filled the air and memory was fallible.<br /><br />The `Pynchon meets Chandler' motif is not unique to the book; in a sense Pynchon has always been meeting Chandler, but here the meeting occurs in the setting and genre where that meeting can be most fruitful.  A real bonus is the `soundtrack'--conveyed through fictional lyrics created by Pynchon or by references to the songs of the time, which are listed/linked on Amazon's site, courtesy of the author.  At 369 pp. this is not a doorstop like Against the Day or a quick read like The Crying of Lot 49.  While not a beach book it is as close as Pynchon has got to writing one.

B000FBFMFW|5.0|Each book keeps getting better and better. Usually the 2nd book of Robin Hobb's trilogies is a setup for a dramatic conclusion.

0545128285|3.0|The Tales of Beedle the Bard is an interesting collection of wizarding fairy tales that was cute and entertaining. However, I do feel that it is the weakest entry in the Harry Potter collection. That is not to say that it is a bad read at all, I just felt that in comparison to other Harry Potter works, this one falls a bit short.    The tales themselves are ok. I can't quite put my finger on what is missing, but they just do not quite have the feel of classic fairy tales from the Grimm brothers or Hans Christian Andersen. Something about them is just not quite right. I'm not saying that I'm looking for a carbon copy stylistically, but there's just something missing considering that these tales are supposedly handed down from generation to generation of witches and wizards.    The notes on each tale are where this book shines. Personal quips by Dumbledore and Rowling herself are quite nice and give this book the little extra punch that it needs to make it worthy of inclusion in Harry Potter's world.
B000FBFMIO|5.0|I was so pleased to have discovered this book. After reading the Farseer trilogy I was estatic to see that Robin Hobb had brought the characters back for this trilogy.

0142410705|4.0|HUGE follows the adventures of would-be detective Eugene \\"Huge\\" Smalls, the smallest, meanest and angriest kid in the sixth grade. HUGE pulled me in immediately with its nod to the detective novels of old. Since Huge is a fan of Raymond Chandler and other detective noir characters, he speaks their language which is very amusing for the reader. At the start of the book, Huge is hired by his grandmother to solve a mystery which will take him to places he has never been and give him a purpose.<br /><br />Huge should be an unlikeable character. He is angry, scrappy and unpleasant. He doesn't play well with others and constantly gets into trouble. But Fuerst has found the heart of this character. You cannot help but love Huge as he tries to navigate the difficults of the preteen life as a child with an above-average IQ and a below-average ability to deal with others. In many ways, this book reminded me of AN ABUNDANCE OF KATHERINES by John Green although Huge is much more of a social pariah than Colin Singleton.<br /><br />Ultimately, Huge is a coming of age story about a boy trying to understand the world around him. He makes mistakes and his perceptions of reality do not always play out. The mystery is almost a footnote as the greater story is Huge's evolution. A poignant and often humorous tale about finding your place in the world.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Recommended. Huge is destined to one of those characters that, while sometimes unlikeable, is hard not to love.
0756405890|4.0|I first picked up this book with a little hesitation. I had heard a great review on NPR where the reviewer (stasso or Corrigan) couldn't say enough good things about it. I'm always looking for a decent sci-fi/fantasy read and since since they have been so sparse over the last few years, I thought I would give it a try.<br /><br />And to my astonishment, this was a really pretty good book. I say astonished because it follows some formulaic tried and true plot recipes with a steady hand. This is a story told countless times before. Only here... it is told better.<br /><br />What Rothfuss has done is say take the story of King Arthur just for example. And instead of giving the reader 80 pages of Arthurs childhood, the author gives you 800 pages all very well written with story arcs leading here and there.<br /><br />Sadly, and I am not sure how this is going to turn out in the end because were only 1/3 of the way through... Rothfuss has started to turn his protagonist \\"Kvothe\\", into a super hero. Man, I just hate that. I hate when authors feel a need to make their characters the smartest, handsomest, strongest, greatest warrior/whatever genre you wish to talk about. If I am reading about another indestructible person, it takes a lot of the suspense out of the read.<br /><br />Ok, so two things, if you like marvel comic books and superman/spiderman/batman, this is a total must read for you. Im telling you that your going to be giving this book five stars. However, if you think those characters are wayyyyy overplayed like I do and your sick of someone being the best ever... you still might very well really enjoy this book. The writing style, small stories, plot structure, all add up to a unique and very well done first installment.
142813994X|5.0|This is one of my favorite books of all time.  Despite the fact that I loathe memoirs and find them trendy, Stephen Kind devotes a great deal of auto-biographical description that may turn some people off, including myself, if it isn't that the guy has a great deal of wisdom to share, learned the hard way of course.  Anectodal devices are implemented before he begins to talk real shop.  There are very few authors who can write about writing, but one must remember that the guy was a teacher for a long time before his first successful mass produced book, and my virginal S.K. read \\"Carrie\\" made him the King of Bad Dreams and turned a poor Maine joe into a bazillionaire.  After reading it, you realize there is no way this man could not have made it in the publishing world; it was meant to be.  He is a prolific writer, a master story teller, and manages to be succinct yet detailed enough to produce horrific and life-altering visual experiences in his fiction that are pulled straight out of the darkest corner of the human psyche.  But nevermind that, I'm not reviewing \\"IT\\", I'd have to reread it, and I vowed never to do that, I'm reviewing a non-fiction book by a great author and I have learned a great deal about writing from him. From motivational techniques, layman explanations about passive and active voice (which is extrememly difficult to teach), and the attempts to aknowledge and correct the mistakes of bad, often horrible writers, this book's got it all.  I even use some of his examples in my teaching as I am cursed by fate to be a \\"teacher\\" of writing, which you really cannot \\"teach\\".  Mr. King explains it, you need a good working vocabulary and it is essential to be an avid reader if you want to write. Basically, he implies, you need to have a large amount of tenacity and creativity. He doesn't talk about grammar in a clinical or perfuntory manner.  He tells you why you need grammar and how to use it as if you were sitting across a coffee table casually chit chatting. about it. As a child I never learned grammer, and tuned it out in high school, but learned proper grammar through reading.  I learned a great deal from this book, and that's after I got my degree in literature and have been teaching high school English for years.  This book is an absolute must for any writer, and the parts where he recalls his personal mistakes (like wiping his butt with poison ivy after taking a dump in the woods), being too gradiose for his own good (the monster desk story). The stories he tells of his rejections and persistence (you need to thank his wife, Tabitha, who pulled \\"Carrie\\" out of the trash), and his candid confessions of drug and alcohol addiction (he prefers Scope not Listerine, who wouldn't?) add depth and a strongly definable theme to the book and can be used in the classroom as a teaching device.  He is an all around cool dude, an excellent teacher, and a lot of fun.  What I learned: Work hard, work harder, take it seriously but don't let it kill you, and above all else, don't wipe your ass with poison ivy.  I have the hardcover edition, and hate the other paperback illustrations.  The hardcover has a picture of a cellar door surrounded by pretty blooming impatiens but still manages to scare me.

B00076Q024|5.0|Nowadays, it is quite common for a band can take a hiatus from recording/touring for a couple of years. Back in the day, a year away from the studio or off the road was a recipe for disaster. But guitarist Mick Box went against the norm in 1982 and Uriah Heep roared back onto the scene.<br /><br />The band had spent several years trying to reinvent itself while keeping an ambitious recording/touring schedule before calling it quits in 1980. But Box used the time off to plot a sustainable course for the band, which included the return of drummer Lee Kerslake - who brought bassist Bob Daisley from their stint with Ozzy - along with vocalist Peter Goalby and keyboardist John Sinclair.<br /><br />Five of the 10 original tracks are covers, but the unbridled \\"take no prisoners\\" approach to the sound brings back fond memories to the gothic metal from earlier albums, but with the drive that was looking to the future. Box shines on the top cut - Too Scared to Run - while Sinclair takes the reigns on Chasing Shadows and Hot Persuasion fits neatly in the harder-edge AOR sound that was finding airplay on FM radio. The best cover is Prisoner (lyrics by D.B. Cooper/performed by Sue Saad and the Next), with That's the Way That It Is (Paul Bliss/The Bliss Band) very close behind.<br /><br />The album cover may be chilling for some, but the music inside - bolstered by six bonus tracks - sizzles. This was a tremendous comeback by a band that had imploded in 1980.

B001NEK2GE|5.0|As a sometimes semi-addicted World of Warcraft player, I'm always interested in peripherals that will enhance my gameplay. For me, it's all about comfort - I can play for hours at a time, and anything that makes that time more enjoyable is all good. Besides, as much as I love my WOW, carpal tunnel syndrome seems like a high price to pay for playing a game.<br /><br />A year ago, before there was such a thing as a Logitech G13, I purchased the [[ASIN:B000FRW8KS Fang Gamepad by Ideazon]. I liked the basic design. It let me navigate with its dedicated movement buttons, putting my left hand away from the cramped confines of the keyboard. Unfortunately, the overall feel of the Fang was cheap and plasticky. It's very lightweight, which isn't a great quality in a desktop device - it tended to slide around when the action got heated.<br /><br />Worse, the Fang, like almost all of Ideazon's products, don't offer out-of-the-box computability with Macs. While my system recognized the navigation buttons as W,A,S,D equivalents, there was no way to assign functions to the other buttons. A clever third-party program, ControllerMate, will allow you to map those buttons, but it's a tough program to learn and adds $15 to the cost.<br /><br />When the Logitech G13 came out, I decided to try it as a replacement for the Fang. I'm glad I did. The G13 isn't inexpensive, but it's one of those rare computer peripherals where, when you get your hands on it, you feel you've gotten your money's worth. It's an undeniably solid piece of equipment that's designed for serious gameplay. It's angled design makes for incredibly comfortable operation, even on the longest quests or battlefields.<br /><br />Best of all, it offers native Mac compatibility. The macro writer is intuitive and easy to use. The G13 knows when you're playing WOW, so it automatically loads the appropriate (customizable) profile to get  the most out of the game. I understand there are built in profiles for other games too, but WOW sucks enough of my time that I haven't had a chance to try them out.<br /><br />Two features of the G13 that I haven't found as useful as I'd anticipated are the LCD and the joystick controller. While the LCD displays stats that are related to WOW, I find they're not informative enough to justify my taking my eyes off the computer screen. The small joystick, on the bottom left, looked like it would be a great way to move around, but in practice, I found it a little awkward. Maybe I'm just used to the W,A,S,D metaphor, but I just set the keys in the middle of the G13 to correspond to those keys and it's been great.<br /><br />In closing, the G13 is an outstandingly made and designed gamepad that will your improve your game and save your wrists. While you might not need or use or its bells and whistles, its a serious device you can grow into. Best of all, in a market that is rarely inclusive of the Mac OS, the G13 plays beautifully with those of who'd much rather brave the Wrath of the Lich King than the Wrath of Windows.<br /><br />Scott Sherman, author, Lambda Literary Award Winning Best Gay Mystery, 2009, [[ASIN:1593500599 First You Fall: A Kevin Connor Mystery]]at I haven't had a chance to try them out.

0425218929|3.0|I'm just not sure what to think about this series.  I like forensics angle, and the mystery, but these later books are just so bogged down in sturm und drang of Kay's life. Oh, the malaise! Kay Scarpetta has the angst of your average 15 year old girl, and it's starting to get in the way. The story here is interesting and does make you wonder about what would have to happen if a disease such as smallpox were to be used as a weapon, and the final confrontation was good, but I found the \\"who\\" in the \\"whodunnit\\" rather unsatisfying. Part of what makes a mystery satisfying is the discovery of whether or not you are right in your suspicions, but in this book there really was no way to figure it out ahead of time. Yet, I keep reading them.
B001GS0O88|5.0|John Grisham is one of the best writers in America today. This brilliant New York Times Bestseller is a perfect example of Grisham's unmatched story-telling abilities. Wonderfully drawned characters, dead-pan descriptions of the mannerisms of the Deep South and a whooping fast-paced legal thriller that is unbeatable.  I have read every John Grisham book ever written. Along with Pelican Brief, The Appeal, The Client, the Jurour, and Runaway Jury this book rates right-up among the best.  John Grisham does just as much for the full exposing of the social issues of race, poverty, justice and power as \\"To Kill A Mockingbird.\\" This book would make a great movie!

0156027321|5.0|I'm not a literary genius.  All I can tell you is that I just enjoyed the book so much.  The begining was a little slow, but once the ship sank, it started moving and I couldn't put the book down.  Although you get the impression in the beginning that this is going to be a \\"religious\\" story, the author doesn't preach religions or God.  If he did, I didn't even feel it.  In fact, God or religion are hardly mentioned, once the boy is lost.  (The author's observations of Chirstianity, Islam, and Hindu, however, when Pi decided to absorb all 3 religions, are surprisingly keen.)      The story moves on, with good, clean humor.  it's believable, and gullible as I was, I almost thought this was a true story.  The relationship between Richard Parker, the tiger, and Pi is fascinating as well.  That alone is worth reading.  Pi, to me, was a little too mature, too knowledgeable and intelligent, for his age, however.    The final pages, the interview with 2 Japanese, were a little surprise.  I thought they kind of ruined the whole thing, but then as I read on, they turned out to be -- well, these pages finalized the uniqueness of this book.  There are so much the author wanted to say, perhaps, but I simply enjoyed the interactions between the 2 men and Pi.  (I think the author enjoyed writing it too.  You can tell by his choice of fonts.)    The book is very unique, and I appreciate that there are no foul languages in it.  For entertainment, or for deeper reading, the book is worth the money.  You'll not regret.
B0010X745K|3.0|This is a review of the story/movie, not the disc.<br /><br />As with many a Stephen King story, there is often a mesh of twisted scriptures, at least one literary Christ figure, horrible things from the unknown, and at least one underlying moral. This has got a blender-full of all of that... but in the famous words of Blendtech, \\"will it blend?\\" Not exactly.<br /><br />After a harrowing storm, the lead character, David Drayton (Thomas Jane) heads to town with his crotchety neighbor and son to get supplies to fix a broken window. A strange mist is seen over the lake, but dismissed as storm after-glow and they head to the local food mart, full of every stereotypical character from the one-horse town.<br /><br />As the mist envelopes the community, military vehicles are racing to and fro and the air raid siren goes off. A bloodied old man runs to the store, proclaiming that they need to lock the doors - something in the mist took a local. Took them. Yeah- and they believe him. You gotta start this story somewhere.<br /><br />Enter local loon and Messiah-in-waiting, Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden). As always, Harden is the consummate actress. She couldn't act poorly if forced to at gun point - so bravo for her, but thumbs down for this looney portrayal of a scripture twisting nutjob that half the occupants of the store begin to nearly worship and some end up killing for her on command.<br /><br />The mob rule mentality - ok, I'll buy that. People are basically evil by nature - we need constant enforcement by society, parents, laws and faith to keep us from killing each other - when threatened by a definitely lethal unknown, with no reasonable hope of rescue, people will sacrifice their own mother if it makes them feel better.<br /><br />For someone who can quickly turn to the pages of her Bible she had conveniently stowed away with her in her purse, for just such an occasion, Carmody is foul-mouthed and not too hip on scriptures as she purports. She refers to the book of \\"Revelations\\" - in absolutely NO VERSION of the Bible is this book in the plural. It's a common mistake, but in a final script, laughable.  While Carmody is the voice of chaos, Drayton is the voice of reason - yet he is akin to a John the Baptist at first - a lone voice crying in the wilderness.<br /><br />A handful of the store occupants go to the loading dock to see why the generator is failing. Despite Drayton's warnings that he heard 'something' eerie outside the door, the testosterone is raging too high for these small-minded country folk who resent education and success, and they must prove themselves by venturing into the mist. I do tire very much so of this stereotype of the simpleton in the small town who has no respect for those with an education, yet those who are college educated are by definition, sound, logical and always right. Uh... no. But ok, we roll with it... the eerie music continues...<br /><br />As you expect by the music, sweat, testosterone and raised voices, the source of the eerie sound that Drayton heard, comes through the door opening via an extremely nasty set of tentacles that come right out of the worst nightmare you've ever had, after having seen cockroaches, then getting food poisoning. The thing is viciously strong, almost intelligent, full of rage and spikes that will take the flesh off an elephant with merely a love tap. The machismo men that were all hell-bent for leather to fix the generator stand like monuments as the poor lad gets eviscerated by the unknown goblin thing that eventually pulls him into the mist.<br /><br />Even the remnant of a tentacle chopped off with an axe is not enough to convince an otherwise apathetic crowd. Drayton's crotchety neighbor is delusional in his refusal to even look at the evidence, and races to his death with other disbelievers to prove that they're right, as they march out the door, into the mist. Can you say \\"dismembered body parts?\\" Oh yes, the flesh eating monsters know to leave parts behind just to scare the rest of their food - that makes perfect sense.<br /><br />Night falls, and we're not just talking tentacles anymore. We've got some jurassic freaking mosquitos that can suck the lava out of a volcano for breakfast and some bat-looking things - it's like Pandora's box threw up in this little town. The mist is all kinds of messed up. It's the stuff that Noah purposefully did not take on the ark... and it's attracted to light and these idiots are all pointing giant spotlights out a window at night into a white fog, but somehow they actually see outside instead of their own reflections. Yah - physics takes on unique properties in this store. The phones don't work. No cell phones. No land lines - but the power just goes on for days in this one grocery store. Yup.<br /><br />Tensions mount. One bathroom, no showers, lots of folks who all have their own issues, all getting mind bent over this house of horrors going on outside - thinking of their loved ones who are likely already being digested and pooped out - not a recipe for normal thinking or calm attitudes.<br /><br />Considering Anne Frank, her family and 2 other families were hidden away successfully in an attic for 2 years with Nazis constantly looking for people who were hidden away, and they still remained civilized, these people are ready to eat their own young after just 2 days. Well, maybe not their own young, but Mrs. Carmody is more than willing to sacrifice your son to satisfy God's wrath.<br /><br />Thanks to 3 young military officers (two of which hang themselves... giving you a hint of how well they thought the situation was going to play out) trapped in the store, the truth comes out as to what the mist is, and where these creatures have come from. It's not good, and I don't want to spoil it for you... it's a believable explanation - I mean - other than \\"you're just having the worst nightmare you've ever had,\\" there really isn't another one that's feasible in my opinion.  The concern is, will this ever end? Will the creatures ever leave? Is this a local or world-wide phenomenon? Is there any hope other than just being the last one to be unkown critter vittles?<br /><br />The morals are many in this tale:<br />-don't jump to conclusions<br />-two days is not long enough to decide that this will last forever without end - how about a little more faith & endurance, people?<br />-suicide is rarely a choice that in the end solves your immediate problem... you're still dead<br />-let calmer heads prevail<br />-even the calmest head can lose reality when surrounded by crazies and craziness for days<br /><br />The special effects are GOOD. The Foley sounds are GOOD and eerie. There's a lot of blood, dismemberment and sinew - not one for kids or for expectant mothers. The story is all over the map. A little less drama in the store would have made more sense. The movie just goes on forever. Tensions are so high, people in the theater laughed out loud when certain characters were killed... out of a sense of relief that their blathering dialog would finally end. The movie loses a couple of stars for the out of balance portrayal of Mrs. Carmody - no one there with sensible counter arguments to her non-sensical ramblings on how this was proof that God was heaping his wrath upon this town for such sins as splitting the atom! Yes, we all remember that one from Deuteronomy! I didn't buy the sudden devotion/following this crazy lady had in just what appeared to be 36 hours. She spoke with authority, but was kooky and over the top - I think in a real world scenario, it would have taken at least a week for her to get that kind of following. When you think you're going to be eaten alive by a hideous, heartless unknown (I mean,it's not like it's a bear that's got cubs to feed or anything), the last thing you want to hear is the nagging, raised voice of a woman... and I AM a woman, and I don't want to hear it. Someone would have strangled her before she had more than a handful of followers were this to (God forbid) play out in real life.<br /><br />There were also continuation errors - most notably, a revolver that had been used several times, magically is fully loaded after being dropped by the gunman, after he is consumed by one of these instruments of God's purported wrath. I did find myself on the edge of my seat in spots - the acting is very good and the unknown is often far scarier than the known. This movie could have been a lot better. A LOT better. It was worthwhile seeing ONCE. I don't buy a DVD unless I plan on viewing a film repeatedly - this is one I never ever have to see again. It's scary, bloody and insulting on purpose - and in the end, it is ultimately a story devoid of happiness, hope or reprieve. I suppose in a way, as a Stephen King story, it's a resounding success in that it is a story that haunts you - but doesn't real life do that, anyway? In the end, you will leave this film utterly disappointed and depressed - I just don't see how anyone could have a different perspective after seeing it.

B000HEWEE4|4.0|I'll never understand why directors take a great plot, good acting, and all-round good movie and feel they need to stick in people living together who aren't married and camera shots of a woman's chest!

I don't think so.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|Does Iron Maiden need an introduction? Am I even qualified to write a review on this band? I don't know. But I do know Iron Maiden is without a doubt the greatest thing to happen to the metal genre as we know it.    Dance of Death is the 2003 follow-up to 2000's aptly named Brave New World. On Brave New World, Bruce Dickinson re-united with his old band after a long hiatus. Expectations were high, and they were met with a very good outing by the band in Brave New World. Well, that album was just warm up.     Dance of Death kicks off with \\"Wildest Dreams\\". This was the first song I heard off the album, and during the song I thought \\"Oh %#%^, this album might actually suck\\". Wildest Dreams is not impressive. At all. But \\"Rainmaker\\" is a super-catchy song spear-headed by some of Dickinson's best work. \\"No More Lies\\" starts off with some catchy guitars and builds...and builds...and builds into some wailing by Dickinson. I am not sure what Iron Maiden was trying to prove as Dickinson begins to wail at 2:14. Maybe that Dickinson's vocals can somehow be impressive and oppressive at the same time. The song usually receives a quick \\"previous\\" or \\"forward\\" at this point.    \\"Montsegur\\" is a very heavy song a la Powerslave era. Then the title track comes. This isn't Iron Maiden's greatest song to date. But it will probably find itself in many metalhead's top 5 Iron Maiden songs of all time. The song is ludicrously catchy. It starts simply with some guitars, and soft singing. Then another guitar comes in, and the song builds. Then the third guitar comes. And the song sounds much fuller, while still maintaining a \\"slow\\" tempo. At 3:00 the song kicks into overdrive. And still the song continues to build into fuller, richer, and faster sounds.    Upon hearing the title track, I honestly didn't think there would be another song on the album that would top it. I was wrong. I can comfortably say (without expecting physical retaliation) that \\"Paschendale\\" is Iron Maiden's greatest song. Even better than \\"Hallowed be thy Name\\". It is an 8 and half minute long epic about one of the bloodies battles in WWI. The band has been known to give history a little bit of the Iron Maiden treatment in the past, and this is no different. It is simply an amazing song. Epic, grandiose, equal parts heavy and melodic...I can't really give this song an adequate description of it's power. \\"Face in the Sand\\" is also another gem, as the song builds and builds into some more of the band's patented combination of drumming, wailing, and melodic guitars.    The bottom line? Dance of Death contains some of Maiden's best. And some of their worst. If every song on the album was as good as \\"Paschendale\\" and the title track, we would have Iron Maiden's strongest album yet. If every song was like \\"Wildest Dreams\\" or \\"Age of Innocence\\" we would have a strong contender for Maiden's worst yet.

1400067936|3.0|I usually review books that are great or terrible. I wasn't going to write a review but then I figured that the books I choose to review would have a selection bias. Thanks to this book, a lot of nagging questions I have about the nature of luck and randomness were verified to be nagging questions that at least one other person has too. The author and I definitely share a lot of concerns about the hubris of the typical market participant. I liked this book because it uses examples to highlight how people tend to misunderstand probabilities and become vulnerable to various cognitive biases which he covers. I didn't, however, feel like this book was a comprehensive treatment of this topic. It didn't really delve into mathematical discussions of randomness as known to information theory. It didn't provide a comprehensive catalog of neurologically based cognitive defects humans generally suffer from. It didn't outline any particular strategy for investing or forecasting. What this book did was to discuss all of these topics with a focus on getting the reader to be a little more thoughtful about the role luck plays in investing. If you think of yourself as a careful investor, then this book is worth a read to reinforce your approach. (Confirmation bias?) What I didn't like so much about the book was that the author is clearly an insufferable snob. I am too, but I don't write books underscoring that fact. His literary style was comfortably readable if not ideal and it seemed we shared many philosophical points of view. The author is definitely intelligent and capable, but his tone makes him seem like a total wanker, someone you would not want to be stuck in an elevator with even if he was going to help straighten out your mistaken investment ideas. The partial redemption of this condescending attitude was the admission that by calling every human stupid (i.e. irrational) he must necessarily be stupid too. He didn't leave the impression that he believed it, but he did at least say it. So, the author's an idiot (like everyone) but he does seem to be trying to come to terms with that. In fact, it does seem that he's getting rich from it. If you're interested in randomness, and cognitive biases in conjunction with conservative investing, go check this out from the library. I'll be returning it today.east say it. So, the author's an idiot (like everyone) but he does seem to be trying to come to terms with that. In fact, it does seem that he's getting rich from it.

B001FB55H6|4.0|I hadn't heard of \\"The Watchmen\\" graphic novel before seeing this film and although my interest was piqued by the trailers, I wasn't able to catch the movie during its theatrical release. Having just purchased a Blu-Ray player, \\"The Watchmen\\" turned out to be the first Blu-Ray movie I rented and I was really anxious to see it. I have to admit, my first viewing of the film left me pretty befuddled. It was extremely long (this was, of course, the \\"director's cut\\") and the story was not at all what I had expected. Although the film was visually stunning, I had a really hard time finding a way to care about the characters that populated the Watchmen world. None of them were particularly like-able and some were downright despicable. Unfamiliar with the story, I found myself scratching my head when it was all over and wondering what the point of the whole thing was.<br /><br />Seeing \\"The Watchmen\\" reminded me of the first time I saw \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" I'd never read Tolkien's books and had no clue what the story was about. I gave up on the film about 30 minutes in. I didn't understand the extremely complex story and couldn't comprehend the almost Shakespearean dialogue and terminology. My daughter recommended watching the film with the subtitles on, and in this way I was finally able to follow the story and learn my way around Tolkien's world. I also became a diehard fan of both the films and the books. I certainly don't think that \\"The Watchmen\\" in any way compares to Tolkien in terms of the breadth and depth of its story and characters. But it was compelling enough for me to give it another try and I have to admit that \\"The Watchmen\\" grew on me.<br /><br />Despite lackluster performances from some of the cast, the story itself is what carries the day...a frank and unvarnished exploration of the less-than-heroic side of masked heroes and the social/philosophical implications of a society that embraces vigilantism. All of the characters have a back-story, some of them more interesting than others. The glue that seems to hold the whole thing together is the fascinating anti-hero, Rorschach, played by thoroughly committed comeback kid, Jackie Earle Haley. In both masked and unmasked form, Rorschach commands a morbidly fascinating persona and whenever he is on the screen you cannot help but look at him. He continuously moves the story forward, taking us into ever darker places with his uncompromising persistence. Considering that he was a character with so few redeeming qualities, I was surprisingly sad to see Rorschach reduced to a gory smear in the snow in the last minutes of the film. In the end, one is left with unanswered questions about personal motivation and whether ends really do justify means. Be forewarned, there is absolutely nothing uplifting about this film. Are any of the characters really \\"heroes?\\" You will have to decide for yourself.<br /><br />Watching the film a second time also helped me to appreciate some of its more subtle attributes...the amazing complexity of the CGI effects, from the tiny electrical undulations beneath Dr. Manhattan's skin, to Rorschach's mesmerizing mask...the humor, sometimes very understated (a constantly malfunctioning flashlight). I can understand the sentiments of those put off by the VERY graphic violence and the film's single (almost superfluous)  sex scene. But this is not a movie for kids, nor is it a typical superhero romp. \\"Watchmen\\" pulls no punches in exposing the flaws of all the main characters, so it's a challenge to find anyone to root for. Perhaps that's the point...that life is rarely as simple as right and wrong, good and bad, black and white.<br /><br />So, who watches the Watchmen? Hurm....hem more interesting than others.

When attempting to explain why she had funded the complete renovation and \\"greening\\" of a 40 plus year old Boys and Girls Club in the economically deprived North Las Vegas, NV area, the donor quoted the book Outliers and its author Malcolm Gladwell.  Using the examples of Bill Gates, The Beatles, and underutilized genius Christopher Langan cited in the book, the donor drew the parallel to helping children through the Boys and Girls Club by giving them opportunities to practice skills in a safe environment that they otherwise might not have the chance to experience.  Many books are a great read.  How many books have inspired the funding of a multimillion dollar project that will help children for decades to come?  To continue the process of paying it forward, the donor also purchased 100 copies of the book and gave a copy to everyone in attendance.

Totally adored the foods, wines, shopping in the outside markets and carefully selecting just the right ingredients by smelling the produce and becoming friendly with the vendors.. \\"I feel like I AM French!\\" she'd say. Effortlessly Julia created new dishes to serve her happy husband and also hosted small dinner parties for very appreciative friends.<br />  This two hour movie is based on Two true stories. The lesser known Julie is a employed, \\"lowly cubicle worker\\", played by Amy Adams. Julie Powers also has a loving and supportive husband. (A rare story line in today's movie offerings.)  29 year old Powers also longs for something more in life. She and husband both use public transportation to work and live in a crammed apt. above a pizza parlor in Queens, N.Y..<br />  Powers is a huge admirer of the legendary Julia Child. She tells her husband, \\"I could write a book! I have thoughts!\\" Powers passion leads her to set up a blog to record her daily progress, as she prepares, from Child's famous cookbook, 524 recipes in 361 days. A incrediable undertaking with limited resources and in a very small kitchen.<br />  Positive elements >> Hard work is rewarded and the value of admitting mistakes. There's lots of good natured humor.<br />  Meryl Streep, of course is one of Hollywood's darlings. She's given rave reviews and deserves them. I was very surprised to read that the All-Knowing critics trashed Amy Adams great performance. I really enjoyed Amy's character!<br />(this review written by my sister Marybeth Slabby)course is one of Hollywood's darlings. She's given rave reviews and deserves them.

B00243FQFA|5.0|What can I say, I,m a Stargate freak, the stories are fresh, the special effects to me were superb. I own a copy of all 10 season's of Stargate SG-1 including the two after movies. All 5 seasons of Stagate Atlantis even though the Fifth season is still playing on TV in my area. As of yet I have not seen any fifth season in stores around here, but who cares, I'm to ill to get out of the house just now to worry about it, thanks to amazon.ca, I have my copy.
0385338724|2.0|I am not a huge fan of chick lit, I am the first to admit this. However, give me a Marian Keyes book any day and I will put everything aside to finish it on one sitting. I love all of Emily Giffen's books and Elin Hilderbrand's as well. I decided to try and find some other popular chick lit authors, and came to the conclusion that I should try Sophie Kinsella. I chose \\"Remember Me\\" as it sounded good and was very well reviewed. I just could not get into this book. It was silly, shallow, lame and childish. Lexi was not relateable and I could not get into her story or her character. I am looking for an author who writes a more mature, yet funny and poignant type of novel. Something with a bit more depth. This seemed aimed at a younger audience, perhaps teens. It was so silly that I could'nt even finish it. Very disappointed. 2 out of 5.
1594202249|3.0|Larry \\"Doc\\" Sportello is a pot head... acid freak... P.I. (Private Investigator) in Los Angeles during the drug drenched sixties. When his ex-girl friend Shasta shows up after being incommunicado for over a year... a chain of events unfolds... that simultaneously... and non-concurrently... spews forth in different... and parallel directions... on so many levels... that the protagonist Doc... and the author... at times leave the reader scratching their head... as to what the heck is going on... and who the heck is actually saying and thinking... what is being thought... and what acts are actually occurring. Embellishing that very ambiance is the fact that Doc continually says... or thinks... that he really doesn't know whether he actually saw what he saw... or he was simply having an acid flashback.<br /><br />The name of Doc's business is LSD... which stands for \\"Location, Surveillance, Detection\\"... and he  smokes more weed than the combined inhalation of one-hundred cloned \\"Snoop-Dogs\\". Doc's multi-faceted investigations regarding a missing real estate mogul and reportedly dead musician... mushrooms (not meant in a drug sense here... but certainly is throughout the book) into a haze of crooked cops... heroine dealers... hit men... sleazy women... and enough paranoia... to spook the entire population of China... in addition to the people that are looking over your shoulder whenever you turn around to read this review. The author does a nice job of recreating the minutiae of sixties Los Angeles including out of business retail chains... TV series and old movies. The constant use of off-the-wall names such as Riggs Warbling... Special Agent Flatweed... Special Agent Borderline... Clancy Charlock... Puck Beaverton... and Trillium Fortnight... are a nice little residual touch. But there are numerous portions of the book that are \\"scattered\\"... where it's extremely difficult to know who's saying or thinking what... and so at times it became a little laborious for the reader... thus affecting the flow of the story.thus affecting the flow of the story.
B0002XH9Z4|4.0|This is a great collection to have.  The only disappointing thing was the DVD \\"Live in Bucharest\\".  It had never been released I can see why!  Michael must of hated it because the \\"sound track\\" must have been taken off a center stage microphone and not the from the main audio line.  The sounds mixer screwed this one up.  The video is great.  His dancing is as good as it gets. All the excitement is there.  Although you can hear the music, it wasn't done in the quality it should be.  I don't think Michael wanted to have this one released because of it.  But still a good purchase as long as the price doesn't exceed $30.  You do get 4 nice CD's. The DVD was just an added surprise.
B0019MQBJW|5.0|The lead dancers and the Corps de ballet of Paris Opera ballet produce a near perfect performance of this work to the accompanyment of Tchaikovsky's glorious music. The Nureyev interpretation sometimes invokes unusually slow tempos which can take some getting used to and his adapting of the storyline to give a slightly more male focus is interesting.  I have loved this ballet and its music for over 50 years now and never tire of it.  This production is a gem with excellent audio and video and clever filming which shows the company at its best. Thoroughly recommended.<br /><br />And it IS 16x9 - the Lawrence review refers to the other Decca Marinsky blu ray whic is the old 4:3 format and should be moved.  Technically this release is first rate.<br /><br />John
0553381687|5.0|I believe this and the second book are by far the best in this series.<br /><br />When I read this book I was on vacation with the second book in the back of the van in a suitcase. I was riding in the van when I finished the book and was so engrossed I immediately climbed to the back, dug through the suitcases, and foud the next book so I could continue. I'm afraid I ignored my family for the duration of the trip as I just couldn't put the book down.<br /><br />The book has multiple complex characters. The author spends chapters building plots and setting you up for an obvious end result, the BOOM! one of the main characters is killed!  Total shocks and surprises. What about the plans that were set in motion, what about the people they were affecting? All of a sudden everything you think is going to happen turns upside down and your anxiously reading to see what will happen next.<br /><br />The later books in the series are a little more tedious and get a little weird - but are well worth reading. My biggest complaint is that the author is VERY slow in getting the books out. Wondering if the next in series will ever be available.<br /><br />If you like fantasy and want something totally different and love a long complex book- give this one a try. I've read it twice and will probably read it again.
1594202249|5.0|Although on the surface Inherent Vice could certainly be described as stoner noir, it's really Pynchon's love letter, or perhaps eulogy, to the sixties, told ostensibly from the point of view of its protagonist, Larry \\"Doc\\" Sportello, a private investigator in 1970 L.A., but coming clearly from the present-day reality of corporate greed, big business, the loss of personal interaction and the erosion of privacy rights.  The plot, an at-times hard to follow mish-mosh of corrupt policemen, ex-cons, feds and businessman, shadowy syndicates, strung-out junkies, surf musicians, Vegas gamblers, acid trips, sixties pop culture references (most of which you won't get unless you lived through them), and lots of interchangeable beach blondes in micro-minis, is sort of besides the point.  Inherent Vice is all about a place and a moment, Los Angeles in 1970, when the optimism of the sixties was fading and the hippie subculture was being done in on all sides -- Nixon, the cops and real estate developers on the right, and Charles Manson and television on the left.  Pynchon revels in it all -- the cheesy fun of cowboy westerns, monster movies, Gilligan's Island and Let's Make a Deal, vegetarianism, big cars, big boards, free love, Hollywood low-lifes, Vegas low-lifes, Valley low-lifes, etc.  Characters like Sauncho Smilax, Dr. Blatnoyd, Bigfoot Bjornsen, Vincent Indelicato, and others romp from the beach to downtown to the Valley to Ojai to Vegas to another dimension in time/space, some meeting bad ends, some falling in love, and almost all getting mellow on the Sensimilla.    It's hard to keep track of everyone but it doesn't really matter.  Eventually you figure out that what Pynchon is really writing about is the small kindnesses of that world and era and the characters, even if you can't always keep 'em straight, just shine.  I wanted the book to continue, but at the same time, Pynchon ended it perfectly.    This is the best book I've read in a long time.  A page turner that makes you think.  If you read The Crying of Lot 49 and liked it, you'll probably like this one as well.  If you need your stories clean and neat, on the other hand, Pynchon probably isn't for you, but at least this one is pretty straightforward and it's a heck of a lot of fun.
0446364495|5.0|I read this years ago - pre-marriage and perhaps in a more 'romanticized' time of my life. But any book that can make me SOB (and I do mean sob) uncontrollobly can't be that poorly written.    I had my boyfriend read it because I was so moved by it. He didn't quite agree with my opinion.    However I thought the love story was perfect (horribly sad - but perfect).    I recommend it.
B0019LY5I2|3.0|So I walked out of this movie after about 45 minutes. G.I. Joe just isn't my kind of movie, but that's not the movies problem. It's my problem. I had no business being there in the first place. For one, I was always ambivalent about the cartoon. I watched it only because it came on after the Transformers. Most of the time I didn't finish the episodes. Not much has changed considering that I saw G.I. Joe only because I had my schedule mixed up with what I really wanted to see: the movie \\"Adam.\\" Having already made the drive to the theater, I took a gamble on G.I. Joe.    With only 45 minutes to work from, all I can write here is that the plot centers around nanobugs that can get inside human beings and reprogram their brains and their immune systems. They can also eat metal or entire cities for that matter. The nanobugs have been intercepted by the bad guys who will do bad things with them. The G.I. Joe force are the people who will stop this. This may sound like a sarcastic synopsis, but really it's not. The plot is as simplistically heinous as how I remember the cartoon. And it shouldn't be anything more than that. This is G.I. Joe we're talking about. One guy even says, \\"the Joe's won't know what hit them.\\" A line that probably came right out of the series, and if it didn't, it could have. Duke, the main character, is not already a member of the G.I. Joe unit at the start of the movie. So he uses lines like \\"I want in.\\" Twice, actually. There's plenty more of where that came from. The movie even borrows the moral platitudes of the 80s; so we get a \\"when-you-get-knocked-down-get-right-back-up-pep-talk\\" from one of the Wayan brothers.    Again, I'm not criticizing. Whoever is behind this movie decided to detour away from Bay's direction with Transformers, and actually make a movie that is true to the source material. I applaud that. Fans of the cartoon will recognize the characters (more than I can say for Transformers), and newcomers won't have to because, from what I could gather, The Rise of Cobra will make for a fun and fast-paced introduction. The acting and the writing may feel as if it were originally a made for TV flick, but that's because it is sincerely inspired by a TV series. Smart move. It will make it all the more easier to start a live-action TV series - after they clean-up on three or four of the big screen versions, of course.    If Hawk is right, and \\"knowing is half the battle\\", then I don't feel too bad about writing a review based on only the first half of the movie. Yo Joe!
B001FBSLH2|4.0|The audio and video quality are very good on this dvd. The video looks almost like a bluray dvd and it sounds great too. If you love jazz and some of the Crusader's favorite old songs, I strongly recommend this dvd. I love it .......... i've watched it over & over.
0375842209|5.0|I had a hard time getting past the first few pages, which were a little odd, but the rest of the book is totally worth it! I loved it! Not going to give the story away, but I would highly recommend it. An interesting story in Germany during WWII because the main character is NOT a jew.
B00127RAJY|5.0|The routines given for Levels 1-3 all focus on intensity, endurance, and the three, cardio, strength, and abs. Faithfully I've completed Level I, but last night out of curiosity, I tried Level 3, and I slept like a baby.<br /><br />The steps overall are doable and each section is repeated twice, and the 20 minute exercise are segmented into 30 seconds. The pace is fast enough that participants have to scurry to keep up and have no chance of feeling a certain exercise is monotonous.<br /><br />Though I had my doubts about the 20 minute routines, I feel that I don't have to spend as much time at the gym anymore. The combination of weights and strength or cardio make the moves powerful. Michaels also offers modified versions for most exercises and she gives helpful suggestions.<br /><br />This routine is definitely meant for the serious exerciser. If you want to sleep well, feel good, and get a bargain DVD, get this one.

She said she did it for every graduating class because it reminds her of us/them. I cried through the whole thing.

B001CUXZT0|3.0|even after 35 years die-hard alice fans are still upset over the break-up of the original alice cooper group. while we all hold our breath for a long overdue reunion, we can take comfort in the fact that @61, alice still performs most of his classics on tour and with each new studio release proves that he at least still has a sense of humor.    in an effort to reach a mainstream audience, his judgement obviously impaired by alcohol, the infamous alice cooper goes to hell and is reincarnated as maurice escargot, a film noir gumshoe detective. although a major disappointment to most cooper fans (myself included) \\"lace and whiskey\\", alice's third solo, actually starts off with one of his best rockers - \\"it's hot tonight\\". this song would have been a welcome addition to the lightweight \\"alice cooper goes to hell\\" album.    the other rocker on the album is \\"road rats\\", which is rumored to have inspired the meatloaf movie \\"roadies\\" and the title cut is a nice mid-tempo tune about the addiction of alcohol and women. the rockabilly \\"damned if you do\\", grows on you and \\"my god\\" was interesting, but it's so overproduced its hard to understand the lyrics. the reflective \\"i never wrote those songs\\" is probably the better ballad although \\"you and me\\" was a pleasant hit. the hysterical \\"king of the silver screen\\", is an absolute gem displaying alice cooper's humor at his very best, and contains a tasty extended guitar solo from dick wagner. \\"no more love at your convenience\\" was an embarrassment.    the \\"lace and whiskey\\" tour was an extension of the \\"nightmare\\" show, including the pre-filmed images, displayed on a giant television screen including faux commercials. alice gunned down giant chickens, brushed a dancing tooth, and even brought back the snake and guillotine. included in the opening slot were nazareth, the tubes and atlanta rhythm section. -- set list: under my wheels/billion dollar babies/i'm eighteen/sick things/is it my body/devil's food/the black widow/you and me/only women bleed/unfinished sweet/escape/i love the dead/go to hell/wish you were here/i never cry/it's hot tonight/lace and whiskey/king of the silver screen/school's out    released may 1977 it reached #42 usa and #33 uk. - singles: you and me b/w it's hot tonight (#9) - (no more) love at your convenience b/w i never wrote those songs (#0)    every alice cooper album has great songs that never made radio. it's not the hits, but the deeper cuts that are the real black beauties... blinddog pick: king of the silver screen
B001LV5OOY|5.0|What can I say? This is like a modern version of some of my fave 80's bands--INXS, Depeche Mode, Psychedelic Furs. I love every track on this cd and have listened to it over and over. I'm amazed that something so complete came out of a debut cd. Fabulous job guys!
0385338910|5.0|Jonathan Tropper takes us on a hilarious journey of a young man that loses his wife unexpectedly and his animated, funny family's way of dragging him out of depression and back into living life. Tropper is a master of painting vivid images of both despair and hilarity. His sharp wit, which is evident in his other books, come through loudly and effectively in the characters of this book. Seriously, he's one of my new favorite writers!<br /><br />The story made me laugh, cry, contemplate and back to laughing out loud. I couldn't put it down. Literally. I recommend it as a light summer read or if you're in the mood for sharp-witted characters that will definitely give you endless one-liners that are both poignant and funny.
031606792X|2.0|I'm so sad... this book is just heartbreaking. I feel in love with Edward in Twilight. I mourned for his loss in New Moon. I tolerated Eclipse with all it's horrendous editing for dear Jacob. (Traditionally the ring is placed on the fourth finger and not the third Ms. Meyers). I read this book because I was so invested in Bella and Edward's relationship. I wanted to see how their relationship developed after the change but it just regressed. There's no Edward. No Bella. Even Jacob is a shell of his former self. I read on hoping that at least, with all the buildup to the climax ,that the encounter with the vulturi would be redeeming but it never even happened.
B00004RCO8|5.0|'Waterloo' is one of the films that I have greatly enjoyed over the years. I have a interest in the Napoleonic period and this film does a good job of depicting the famous end of it. Rod Steiger as Napoleon is one of my favorite performances of one of my favorite historical characters. Steiger has some of the best lines in the film- many taken from actual historical quotes. His moody depiction of Napoleon is always interesting to watch. Not to be outmatched is Christopher Plummer as the Duke of Wellington who really does a good job playing the aristocratic Duke. Plummer also has plenty of good lines. He also has a nice scene with a foraging soldier. There is also a great cross cutting scene in the film the night before the battle that makes it seem that Napoleon and Wellington are talking to one another.     Dan O' Herlihy is also excellent as Marshall Ney.    The massive numbers of men are also a highlight in the movie. There were around 20,000 men from the Red Army playing the French, English, and Prussian forces. These sheer numbers without any computer graphics is just fascinating to watch. Ney's cavalry charge is one of the highlights of the movie. It needs to be seen on a big screen.    A proper DVD release is needed in the US. It needs to be anamorphic and also as full length of a version of the film as possible. Commentaries and any other extras would be appreciated by fans of the film. This movie deserves to be better known.    Highly recommended!
0307455874|2.0|Not a bad read if you want to understand President Obama, but really quite forgettable overall.
B002DKGWSE|2.0|Last House on the Left, the 2009 remake of Wes Craven's 1972 debut film, is by and far a pretty pointless remake.  Garret Dillahunt stars as Krug, an escaped criminal who along with his sadist girlfriend (Riki Lindhome), brother (Aaron Paul), and son (Spencer Treat Clark) in tow.  It isn't long before they come across young Mari (Sara Paxton) and Paige (Martha MacIsaac), whom they proceed to graphically assault and terrorize, and culminate in finding sanctuary with a couple (Tony Goldwyn and Monica Potter), who unbeknownst to them are Mari's parents.  The Last House on the Left remake pretty much follows the original to a tee, up until its final few acts, where sadism and shock values become the order of the day.  While Craven's original still remains a bona-fide shocker to this day, the raw feel of the film helped make it so memorable.  Here, everything is so polished that it just doesn't have the same effect, no matter how graphic and long one can make a rape scene seem, which by and far, is nearly impossible to watch.  The film's flaws are a shame, considering that the cast does surprisingly good work here, but in the end, the film just leaves the effect of being \\"been there, done that\\" more than anything else.  The film is worth a look for fans of the original, as well as those looking for new ways to use their microwave.
0061767581|4.0|I had absolutely no intention of reading this book, but as boredom can go during the summer, I found myself asking \\"Why not?\\"<br /><br />I didn't think I'd make it through the hard copy, so I opted for the audiobook.  I have listened to tons of books on audio-- most horrendously awful, finding only a few (like the Harry Potter Series's Jim Dale... whom I personally deem a minor god) tolerable.  I have on occasion been unable to get past the first chapter on audiobook due to the lackluster vocal acting (that often made the male characters, who were supposed to be breathtakingly hot, sound like my 78 year old grandmother), but I took the chance anyway... as I had already dubbed this book useless beforehand, I figured it would be easy to cut my losses.<br /><br />L.A. Candy was an absolute breezy delight.  It was cute, fast-paced, and can consume the targeted audience with juicy exuberance.  I think I spent the first few chapters debating who I conceived characters to be; but by mid-book, I found it didn't matter.  As a teen light romance, it did the job just fine-- even without placing reality faces to the fictional (or-not-so) personalities.  Lauren's reading of the book was better than tolerable; and by the first few chapters really captivating.  She didn't make the male characters sound like old, angry, cane-toting southern biddies at least.  A definite plus.<br /><br />As a stand alone, minus any connection to the events on \\"The Hills\\", L.A. Candy was an enjoyable, resplendent romp into a world of delectable arrays of jealousy, gossip, friendship, and prospective romance.  If anything at all, it is definitely entertaining.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to more from Ms. Conrad.
B001F7MSG6|2.0|So much CG talent and so much earnestness from Del Toro, so much visual splendor, and it's all to serve a story and screenplay that's plucked right from the head of a suburban ten year-old who plays Xbox all day.  Studio movies tend to aim downward, but this one aims WAY down to the level of Shrek 2, or Nickelodeon.  How this can be the same guy who gave us Pan's Labyrinth, I'll never know.  Repeat, some great CG, but DUMB in the worst way possible.  And by the way Del Toro, you've totally dated this movie by having everyone fight with that retread kung fu wire-fight style.  So, Hellboy is a Chinese acrobat in his spare time?  Man, I feel like I've insulted 10 year-olds in this review, now that I think about it.
1573300403|3.0|Unfortunately, this isn't it.  I purchased this DVD because it is the most highly recommended, fairly comprehensive on Amazon.  Still? This DVD seemed to be something lacking - with a plain, silver disk, and no booklet or anything outlining Michael's career.  I'm happy with the purchases I've made - this DVD, and the Dangerous DVD.  The cinematography for this one is terrific, what can I say?  But it doesn't have BAD.  It doesn't have LEAVE ME ALONE.  It doesn't have a few of the pieces History I has.  Boo!<br /><br />Still, I do not even have any of the oldest videos Michael did in the early '80s.  Wouldn't it be nice to also have performances like BEN, and a few of the solo songs Michael did when he was with the Jackson 5???  Or how about a comprehensive package with EVERRRRYYYYTHINGGGG?!  I would PAY for that! The Jackson 5 Years! MJ's early 80's stuff, as well as songs like - \\"Leave Me Alone\\", and \\"Bad\\" and \\"Beat It\\".  It's time for a complete, comprehensive collection of Michael Jackson, for us die-hards.  Nothing less will do.<br /><br />These current DVD's just aren't cutting it right now - they are fun to have, but grieving fans need something more.  So I'll be waiting to buy anything more with Michael Jackson until I can have it ALL!
B002L3RVCY|5.0|Well, the complete season one of Clone Wars has finally been put out for pre-order. Now maybe everyone who has been crying about how George Lucas released his show will shut up. You know who you all are, and by the way George told everyone what his plans were for releasing this series. Maybe if you had read what he had been planning on doing, you would not have complained so much.    I am glad this is finally coming out as my son and I really liked watching it. I can't wait until Season two starts up, to find out what is going to happen with climax from season one. I want to know what is going to happen to Cad Bain and Zero.     Anyway, I would like George to come out with a series like this one about the years after Return of the Jedi, or even the years leading up to A New Hope. So many possibilties that he can do with this type animation.
B000YGFGD6|1.0|I have to agree with the \\"Time Out Film Guide,\\" that calls this \\"a witless project...boring...unimaginative.\\"  Sorry to disagree with the other reviewers who loved it, but I really do think it's one of the worst films I have seen in a long time. And I'm a Michael Jackson fan. The worst part of it was the last part, with the 3 children - and their dog, who makes an appearance just in case you didn't think it was cute and sentimental enough.  Cute stuff so that your toes curl. I borrowed it from the library, I'm happy to say, and that's where it's going back, today. I was impressed by his running ability - there are a few scenes in which he runs very fast. He looked good, and he looked like he was in very good shape at that time.
B0015OKWL2|3.0|I agree with the reviewer on here who said this would have been a decent cop flick if it were not for Deniro and Pacino which increases the audience's expectations. These two guys are probably the best actors of their generation, but something just doesn't click well for them. Maybe it's because they are better off playing arch enemies (HEAT) than friends. I thought Walberg did a really good job and so did Johnny L.
1571200851|5.0|Detailed easy to follow instructions.  Great pictures and diagrams.  Another reviewer said the diagrams were sometimes difficult to understand.  I did not find that at all.
B000000WA4|5.0|This is THE album of my youth. As a teen of the 90's, I couldn't have gotten through all of the angst and turmoil without this album. The emotional range of the music is phenomenal - from anger to adoration - it covers everything a person feels and wants to feel when they don't necessarily let themselves. Everyone who enjoys music that touches you should buy this album. I find that in my adult years it still affects me similarly and even does so in ways I couldn't have predicted.
B000HT3JNY|4.0|You'll finish this flick with mixed emotions, but definitely like it. Basically, Click is your typical hilarious guy's movie with a great plot that takes a turn for the worse and becomes a sad chick movie.  It's the perfect call if you date bipolar women
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|I really dredded having to watch \\"Mamma Mia.\\" I heard alot of bad reviews,even my Sister hated the film,but it did make alot of money,so I knew someone liked it.  After seeing the movie I didn't like it either,I LOVED IT.  First of all,Meryl Streep can do ANYTHING.If she's in a movie,you know it has to be great.She can sing and dance like there's no tommow.  Its wonderfull seeing actors over 50 singing and dancing,and having fun for once in a movie.Most films have actors over 50 in the background,this one has them featured.   Amanda Seyfried  has the best singing voice,and she's wonderfull in the film,but Pierce Brosnan takes alittle getting use to,but he gives it his best.  \\"Mamma Mia\\"is a Musical Classic  I look forward to watching again.
B00062PN6I|5.0|Great headphones. Other reviewers were incorrect when stating that these headphones only come with the larger phono jack style. The headphones have a built-in adapter. If you unscrew the gold colored headphone cable tip, the smaller 1/4\\" standard ipod/headphone jack is made available. Sound quality is very good, comfort is decent.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|When I first saw the previews of this movie I was a skeptic.  Iron Man was not a household name like Batman or Superman and to be honest I knew very little about the character.  Some might even say he was a \\"B List\\" Super Hero as his own adventures never took off very well and he tended to be bundled with other heroes instead of having a long running series of his own.    However this movie just blows those notion away and if they keep at it not only will this be a great franchise for future movies but my guess it will re-kindle the comic book market for this hero as well.    The studio could have taken the easy way out and done this movie as a cheesy action movie with a thin plot which would make for a great summer blockbuster but be easy to be forgotten over time.  Instead they went all out with a rock solid plot that is real, gritty, and believable.  There is a movie here with action, and not just a bunch of action scenes made into a movie (ie Transformers).      The casting was right on and the actors did a great job bringing the characters to life.  Downey just nails the part in every way.  I have never been a fan of his actually as he has always irritated me but he has redeemed himself in Iron Man and I totally rooted for his character.  Everyone else from major parts to even the smaller parts did a wonderful job.    The art work and effects were also just amazing.  The attention to detail just blows my mind.  The suit in particular and how he puts it on made perfect sense and it was great to share the joy of his discoveries with Iron Man.  A lot of movies skip this part and show something bad happening to the main character and then a short 'build sceen' that makes no sense and then they emerge all decked out.  The older Batman movies come to mind where he has all this super tech but no way to explain any of it.  Iron Man explains it so it makes sense and takes you on the journey to building it all and testing through the kinks of the system and its limitations.    Being that this movie was so wonderful with such great special effects and attention to detail, I ended up 'upgrading' to the Blu Ray version.  The Blu Ray difference stuck out soooo much on this already good looking movie.  The level of detail on the suit in particular just made me constantly say \\"WOW'.  The Blu Ray brought this movie to the next level with sight and sounds along with having a ton of great extra features that my DVD did not have.    In the end I highly recommend this movie to anyone as it is one of my favorite movies now.
B00288KNJU|5.0|Coraline is one of those movies that you have to open your mind a little when you watch it and allow yourself to immerse yourself in the creepy and odd world the story takes place in.  The style is very pretty yet creepy if that makes sense.    This young woman has a less than ideal family life and she is left longing for more.  There is a doll that she is given which is very very old yet looks exactly like her by some chance.  The doll and Coraline explore the house until she discovers a world where it looks just like hers except everything seems perfect, including her 'other' parents that are everything her parents are not.  Coraline is a strong hero who faces tough decisions and must re-evaluate things in her life to move forward.  As the move progresses we share her journey and her adventure as she tries to figure out what the deal is with the doll that looks like her and the 'other' world that seems perfect.    Our family loved this movie and it looked amazing on Blu Ray.  I was on the fence with this one but it delivered and its one of my favorite movies I have seen this year with a unique and wonderful plot, great voice acting, great animation, and a creepy unique yet familiar world that brings it all together.  Coraline is a must see movie.
0316166685|4.0|It's a good story with a complex web of emotions and characters. It hooks you early and drags you through. The ending is satifying and endearing.
B00243FQFA|5.0|Wow!!  I love this series.......the writing is great and spot on!  I find all the characters equally intriguing.  Shepherd is the true American hero in every sense of the word, McKay is the great geek who is afraid of everything, but finds his courage and bravery when the going gets tough.  Ronan is the quiet and silent guy who goes with his feelings and Teyla is the heart of the team.  The humor is sutle, but I still find moments that I have to laugh out loud.  I'm only sorry that this could not have continued a few more years.  I think that it far surpasses SG-1.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|This is by far one of my favorite shows to watch. The storyline, the characters, just transport you to a new place. You will not regret watching it!
B0024F08RO|4.0|Aww, man!  It's over.  This show was a thrill ride from the very beginning, to the very end.  I loved looking forward to how Scofield was gonna outsmart The Company every monday.  But unfortunately all good things must come to an end.  Prison Break season 4 is...interesting, to say the least.  If you are someone that watched from the start, you may be a little disappointed with how the show came to an end.  To me the last season was very unbalanced.  The writing was all over the place.  Starting with the re-emergence of Sarah and Scofield's sudden illness.  Plus how T-Bag after three seasons, develops a heart.  I'm sayin', come on!  Although I have to give all the actors credit for making entertainment out of what those wacky writers scripted.  I thought The General's performance was exceptional as usual!!! As well as Gretchen.  She is definitely a force to be reckoned with.  If you are someone that enjoys quality acting and intense drama than this is for you.  Prison Break will always be remembered by me.  It was a GREAT show with a very imaginative story line!!!!!!!!
1594202249|4.0|Inherent vice has been described as Pynchon-light and it probably is his most accessible novel, filled with ersatz nostalgia. It is a trippy detective novel, complete with its Chandler-esque opening and a myriad of psychedelic twists and turns.  But I think The Crying of Lot 49 still is the best entry into the world of Pyncon because it contains all of the themes that obsess him (pop culture, cults, entropy) in a short novel.  If you enjoy those wild excursions into science (i.e. Pynchon heir Neal Stephenson) there is little here except some musings about old school computer and binary code. There's an avalanche of pop culture references (Godzilla, Scooby Doo), the trademark cornball lyrics, hit-or-miss puns, and weird names (i.e.  Shasta) and the Tristero-like conspiratorial organization, The Golden Fang.     This is the only Pynchon work that is being considered by Hollywood as a feature film. Since it is being compared to The Big Lebowski, I think the Cohen Brothers should direct and Jeff Bridges should play the lead character, Doc Sportello. Doc Sportello, like the Dude in Big Lebowski, is an unlikely detective. Why not make the movie somewhat self referential and almost like a Lebowski sequel: The Dude goes pro? That would really tie the room together.    While the novel was very funny and captured the vibe of the late sixties, I think I like my Pynchon with a little more-well-gravity. Anthony Macris said of Against the Day that it is \\"less a novel than an enormous new planet freshly arrived in the Pynchonian solar system.\\"  This one may be his Pluto (cute and lots of fun, but demoted) but here's to hoping the 72 year old Pynchon has another Jupiter (big and gassy, but fascinating) in the works.

Forget about the \\"Chi\\" factor (it's a good addition, but don't let this make you not buy the book if you're not into Chi). Seriously, this book may have been entitled \\"Feng shui Running\\", \\"Yoga Running\\", \\"Kung Fu Running\\", \\"Minimalistic Running\\" or \\"How to Make the Best Chocolate Chip Cookies\\"... the result would've been the same: Advice that works...

This is it.
B0021L8US0|5.0|This movie is a powerful testament to human imagination and creativity. It's a brilliant work of art. I also see it as a succinct summary of human history: the powerful torturing and exploiting the weak. True, some of the powerful feel compassion for the weak. And most of the powerful just go along for the ride, trying to keep their hands clean.    Well, in District 9, the aliens, whom humans refer to as \\"prawns,\\" could stand for the weak in human history. The aliens were stranded twenty years earlier when their mother ship, for some unknown reason, was marooned in the sky over Johannesburg, South Africa. They soon fell under human control when they came to Earth. They are confined to District 9, a horrible slum, where the poorest South Africans had lived. They are treated as \\"no-class citizens\\" and forced to live on the meager handouts of the government.     Sharlto Copley earns his star status as Wikus Van De Merwe. Wikus appears to be a by-the-book nerd. He's a high-ranking bureaucrat for MNU, the devious private military contractor that controls the aliens. Wikus is willing to cover up the brutal treatment that is meted out to the aliens. For example, he tries to get them to sign documents that they do not understand. These documents will ruin their lives. But, he's sort of an Everyman, who views himself as a decent person.    Well, Wikus proves to be one cunning, tough, and resourceful man. The Academy should create a \\"Best Actor in an Alien Encounter Film Award\\" just for Copley.    Saying much more might spoil this most exciting movie. The stunts and special effects are stunning. It held my rapt attention. Just great.

031606792X|5.0|I am surprised at the negative reviews by other readers. I am very open-minded. Yet, I am thrilled that Bella showed excessive mental strength and skipped the newborn stage to enjoy time with Renesmee and Edward. The family ties became stronger. I absolutely adored Renesmee's spirit and cried like a baby before the final scenes. The second and third books in the series depressed me to no end. All of the dragging scenes in the first three books led me to Breaking Dawn - I couldn't put it down. This book mesmerized me! I'm actually reading Twilight all over again to catch glimpses at the early stages of Bella and Edward's relationship. Their final consummation of their marriage (especially after she became one of the \\"cold ones\\") did NOT disappoint. Anything more detailed would have ruined Meyer's writing.
0688145078|3.0|When we first picked up this book for my three-year-old, we thought it was a pretty great book. My 3-year-old loved it, and even memorized it. He requested that we read it several times a day. Then the new baby came, and I started seeing the problems with the book. For instance, as others have noted, the baby in this book eats from a bottle, and the big brother can help. Since we are nursing, this is not an option for my son and he is seemingly constantly asking why he can't help (if he didn't love the book so much I would just make it disappear at this point, because it seems very contradictory for me to tell him that we don't use a bottle and then to read to him that the baby drinks from a bottle). It is also bothersome that the mother in this book NEVER holds the baby. The brother and father both hold the baby, and we see her in a stroller and in a swing, but there is zero interaction between the mother and baby, and that is what is so completely unrealistic for me. I think it's great to promote dads holding babies, changing diapers, and feeding bottles, but it is not realistic to portray the mom has having no involvement at all.
B00027JYLC|5.0|I was amazed and in awe when I saw \\"Freaks\\".<br />I have always been fascinated with anything out of the ordinary and the real life oddities in this film were amazing to watch I was particularly mesmerized by Shlitzie the pinhead,Shlitzie was actually male but to heighten the freak appeal they put him in a dress and made him wear a bow in what little bit of hair he had on the top of his pin head.<br /><br />The story was interesting and good wins out over evil .Anyone who has ever had a fascination with the bizarre should see this cult classic for sure .There is a scene where it's raining and the freaks are slithering and crawling under a wagon with knives in their mouths and some have guns,it's very frightening and well shot .I was also amazed by the Caterpillar man,he was just a head connected to a stump and could light a cigarette and he would also roll around and get wherever he needed to go.It was wild.I also read where he had fathered several children\\"how I have no clue\\".Freaks is a one of a kind cult classic not to be missed.

B00005JMCN|4.0|Too many short scenes early on, cutting to things that don't really make sense (bull fight, boxing, dismantling car, riding train) and have no dialogue. The Depression era newsreel updates and voiceovers were annoying, but overall it worked as a parable for Depression era, up-by-your-bootstraps hope, w/o sinking into total sentimentality - not everything works out as it would if the whole thing were scripted and Disney-esque, which I appreciated.
B000089QEN|4.0|VANITY FAIR    I have just indulged in a rather interesting experiment. While reading Thackeray's novel, I've also been able to watch the six part BBC serialization starring Natasha Little as Becky Sharp. I'll comment on this BBC serial later--but first to the novel itself.    Well, it's a very good novel. Certainly one of the best from the Victorian period which it parodies so beautifully. Becky Sharp is a fine literary creation and the personal embodiment of that \\"Vanity Fair\\" which Thackeray, on the one hand, appears to despise so much, while winking at us in happy glee and suggesting \\"it ain't such a bad place after all\\" (by gad!)on the other. All the main characters are fully realized and mercilessly exposed in their weaknesses by the unrelenting author.    Becky, as I have said, is the very embodiment of the superficial, and finally worthless, attractions on offer in the pitiless and unrelenting world of \\"Vanity Fair\\" which raises people up for a moment, only to mercilessly crush them forever after they have strutted for their little pompous moment on the high society stage. Amelia's Major Dobbin is the only really honourable character in the book--and he is continually trampled over by all the bright young things who want to make their momentary splash in \\"Vanity Fair\\". Thackeray describes him as a \\"spooney\\" and, indeed, he spends most of the novel as Amelia's platonic lover who dare not ask for more than the little she will give him. Becky Sharp is the real hero, heroine or \\"anti-heroine\\" of this novel \\"without a hero\\". She manipulates everyone with the most perfect judgement and lives for the joy of Vanity Fair's thousand intrigues. Her husband Rawdon's unexpected escape from a debtor's house and subsequent discovery of his wife making love to the Marquis of Steyne (and his resultant thrashing of that gentleman) is probably the most dramatic moment in the book. However, Becky--if not her husband or the Marquis--is able to move beyond even this catastrophe.\\"Vanity Fair\\" is not without faults for the modern reader. Sometimes Thackeray indulges in page after page of almost nonsensical parody of the contemporary society of his day and this comes across (in the 21st century) as even worse than Swift's most obscure rants in Gulliver's Travels on the Tory/Whig politics of his time. Thankfully, Thackeray doesn't usually detain his reader long in such tedious environs, but soon gets his marvellously readable story moving again.    As I wrote earlier, I have been watching the 1998 BBC adaptation of \\"Vanity Fair\\" while actually reading the novel itself--and it's been quite a revealing experience. Of course, one sympathises with the person responsible for making the adaptation. How is it possible to condense the action of more than 800 pages into a 6 hour serial? No doubt it's an impossible task, but I was, mostly, impressed with the beeb's minor success. The adaptation is well done, though it's not without blemish and, most notably, substitutes some of Thackeray's prejudices for several of our own time. For example,(in the novel) Becky's husband, Rawdon, thrashes Lord Steyne with his open hand to make the point that he regards him as a coward and expects to be satisfied in a duel. The beeb substituted a drunken head-butt for this subtle assault--presumably because they thought this was more acceptable to late 20th century British yob culture. Again, the serialization accurately includes a black manservant in the Sedley family. However, he (the black manservant) is given a far larger part in the adaptation than in Thackeray's novel (where, indeed, he is hardly more than a wretched slave). Wouldn't it have been better to simply cut this character out altogether rather than have him purposelessly wandering through (seemingly) every episode full of a somewhat threatening \\"joie de vivre\\"? Nevertheless, as I wrote earlier, the adaptation is probably ALMOST as good as it could have been in the circumstances. In particular, NatashaLittle is quite enchanting as Rebecca Sharp.

They start to expect that the killers might be the couple they're traveling with (Timothy Olyphant and Kiele Sanchez).<br /><br />  The movie gets silly and hard to believe in the last half hour. Yet....that last half hour was very exciting even if it didn't work entirely. I always thought that Olyphant had star potential. He didn't show it in Hitman or Live Free or Die Hard but he showed it here. He was awesome and steals the show easily as a former soldier who's a little off his rocker. G.I Joe came out the same day and is slaughtering this movie at the Box Office. However, A Perfect Getaway is worth checking out a lot more than G.I Joe is.
B001PR0YBM|3.0|The works of Hayao Miyazaki are always populated by unique characters and unbridled creativity in fantastically magical worlds. Ponyo is no different. However, where his other films like Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle play upon more adult themes and oftentimes truly terrifying villains, Ponyo remains very safely in the realm of whimsical childhood adventure, and sadly abandons the heavy adversity found in previous efforts. Still mildly entertaining, gorgeously picturesque, and wonderfully perceptive to the subtleties of childish innocence that evoke poignant humor, Ponyo clearly targets a very young audience.<br /><br />The son of a sailor, 5-year old Sosuke lives a quiet life on an oceanside cliff with his mother Lisa (Tina Fey). One fateful day, he finds a beautiful goldfish trapped in a bottle on the beach and upon rescuing her, names her Ponyo. But she is no ordinary goldfish. The daughter of a masterful wizard (Liam Neeson) and a sea goddess (Cate Blanchett), Ponyo uses her father's magic to transform herself into a young girl and quickly falls in love with Sosuke; but the use of such powerful sorcery causes a dangerous imbalance in the world. As the moon steadily draws nearer to the earth and Ponyo's father sends the ocean's mighty waves to find his daughter, the two children embark on an adventure of a lifetime to save the world and fulfill Ponyo's dreams of becoming human.<br /><br />Ponyo proves once again that it's very difficult to base a movie around a child main character. And considering the lead is five years old, legendary animation director Miyazaki must overcome an especially large obstacle. Unfortunately he is unable to infuse any reasoning into this imaginative but empty fantasy. Sosuke is given the largest challenge of his life and the formidable task of restoring balance to the universe when a hole in the fabric of reality is opened. Conveniently, he never actually has to deal with difficult trials, tests of his capability or proof of his love for Ponyo. Since he is only five years old, it would be a particular nuisance to demonstrate love as anything beyond a simple spoken phrase.<br /><br />The biggest problem with the film is the lack of any real conflict. Granted that it's targeting a notably young audience, but Ponyo plays out as little more than a series of events that progressively get weirder as Miyazaki starts to explore the supernatural and unusual fantasy - all without explanations or a basis in popular mythology. Never does believable danger creep into the picture, nor a frightening villain or emotional tribulations. It seems unnecessary to include a single skeptical character (Toki, voiced by Lily Tomlin) for a timid dose of realism, one who actually questions the phenomena taking place - and she's presented as a crotchety old wretch.<br /><br />At least the animation during the numerous underwater sequences is complex, creative and visually stunning. Apparently so much effort was contributed to these scenes that the human animation is startlingly simple and occasionally ugly. The best part of Ponyo is the music, movingly presiding over the grandest tsunami moments and causing milder segments to briefly become more stirring. Ultimately Ponyo is designed for the smallest of children - what it won't teach them is to avoid talking to elderly strangers with wild orange hair and candy-cane-striped suits who emerge from the sea.<br /><br />- The Massie Twinsyo.

B001MYIXAC|4.0|This is truly one of the most amazing vampire movies I've ever seen. Beautifully shot, restrained, and ultimately very touching (it had me in tears at one point), and it actually does justice to the book it's based on. And unlike most vampire movies there are no ridiculously beautiful vamps hissing and flashing their stupid fangs for no reason, which is a big plus in my book. I'm sick of constantly seeing glorified fashion models wearing all black and stalking in slow motion to industrial music. It doesn't ring true, whereas the characters in this movie do. They avoid all the common vampire cliches but still keep some of the mythology, and it works very well. There are a few points that were very prominent in the the book that aren't touched on or explained in the movie, but that's easy to overlook since they still do a great job of bringing out the characters and keeping the story intact.     I'd suggest you NOT buy the dubbed version, since it really butchers the script, but if you can hold out for the theatrical version with subtitles you'll be glad you did. This is one that you're going to want to see over and over again. I highly recommend it.
B0021L8US0|4.0|Essentially retooling the Halo movie that never was and adapting his short film \\"Alive in Joburg\\", director Neill Blomkamp, with producer Peter Jackson, has crafted one of the most creative and exciting science fiction adventures in the last decade. Almost seamlessly blending aliens into a slightly futuristic society, District 9 utilizes a \\"live\\" footage approach similar to 2008's Cloverfield and merges it with documentary style editing to reveal an effectively realistic vision that feels all the more authentic due to its underlying comparisons and parallels to past and current South African struggles. Not to mention its prophetic accuracy to what a real alien encounter would likely evolve into. Subtexts and foreshadowing aside, we're still left with an absolutely riveting action film laced with solid special effects and a stunning self-reflection on what it means to be human.<br /><br />It has been twenty years since the massive alien spaceship \\"crash-landed\\" above the city of Johannesburg and the millions of insect-like alien inhabitants were hoarded into the rescue camp turned slums of District 9. The aliens are drones with hive mind mentality and have been unable to create a hierarchy of leadership to aid in their tragedy. Global conglomerate MNU's Alien Affairs division was created as a diplomatic bridge to the alien culture, but as conditions inside the fenced-off community rapidly worsened and the violence and criminal activity escalated, a mass exodus to a new location outside Johannesburg appeared the only solution.<br /><br />Cocky but oblivious MNU employee Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley) is chosen to head the colossal task of the District 9 eviction and encounters heavy hostility and hatred from the reluctant aliens. When Wikus is accidentally infected by an alien device and begins to undergo alarming physical changes, he discovers MNU's true objective, and the now condemned fugitive must join forces with an unlikely ally to wage war against an enemy of nearly limitless power.<br /><br />District 9 represents the dawn of a new subgenre: the science-fiction documentary. It started with films like Cloverfield and Children of Men, but is nearly perfected with this alien extravaganza. Grounding extreme sci-fi themes with pseudo-documentary filmmaking techniques and as much realism as possible to suspend disbelief almost entirely, District 9 admirably feels entirely plausible (except perhaps for the interspecies prostitution). With expert attention to details, an expansive mythos and the idea that humans are evil (which requires little persuading), the film substitutes a familiar global situation with isolated alien creatures, all backed with dramatic emotional conflict. There's almost no need for explaining - the aliens look monstrous but serve the role of any refugee camp survivors or apartheid, with a lack of food and equality, segregation, poor living conditions, children running rampant and general disorganization. It's especially effective for American audiences, since Johannesburg is already foreign.<br /><br />Derogatory terms, racism and ignorance naturally lead to exploitation - in this case the evil MNU corporation is both the second largest weapon manufacturer and in charge of alien interactions. No wonder the \\"prawns\\" are easier to sympathize with. But the initial hostility, prejudices and betrayal turn to chances at redemption, escape and finally revenge. And these prove to be highly action-packed themes, complete with CG-heavy alien warfare technology, massive firepower, and Transformer-like combat. \\"My men have done this a hundred times before,\\" claims the ruthless mercenary Colonel. Clearly they haven't before encountered such destructive and bloodthirsty extraterrestrial weaponry. Although an eventual movie based on the popular video game Halo would still be fascinating to see, District 9 thoroughly quenches the thirst for hard-hitting science-fiction adventure.<br /><br />- The Massie Twinstless power.

The film is quite clean with a few innuendos and one woman showing excessive cleavage.

Sarah, the heroine, doesn't need karate to defeat the villains, as so many young female protagonists in today's movies do.  Rather she achieves her mission through courage, cleverness, and friendship.  It's a great family movie, with only brief mild language.  Preschool children will likely find it too scary.
B00006AW2G|5.0|Hey, in 2009 no one, including this reviewer, NEEDS to comment on the fact that The Rolling Stones, pound for pound, have over forty plus years earned their place as the number one band in the rock `n' roll pantheon. Still, it is interesting to listen once again to the guys when they were at the height of their musical powers (and as high, most of the time, as Georgia pines). This album from their most creative period from 1964 to 1971, moreover, unlike let us say Bob Dylan who has produced more creative work for longer, is the `golden era\\" of the Stone Age. While this CD has  a fistful of \\"greatest hits\\" from this period and there are no really bad tracks here the stick outs are \\"Gimme Shelter\\"( as always), the title track \\"Let It Bleed\\", \\"Midnight Rambler\\" and \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\".  Ain't that the truth on that last one.
B000ZM1MG4|4.0|I really liked this movie! I thought was very funny, and Dustin Hoffman did an awesome job pretending to be a woman. Michael Dorsey is an incredibly hard actor to work with, so nobody will hire him. In desperation, he cross-dresses under the name of Dorothy Michaels for a part in a soap opera. He becomes a very popular character, all the guys make a move on him, and he even begins to fall in love with his co-stars Julie Nichols. I highly recommend TOOTSIE!!!
B001PR0YBM|5.0|Hayao Miyazaki is one of those rare directors who can take the magic of nature and childhood, then somehow capture it for the screen.<br /><br />And his tenth Ghibli movie \\"Ponyo\\" is no exception -- it's a reimagined tale of a \\"little mermaid\\" who wants to become human so she can be with a little human boy she loves. It's a simple story told in a simple manner (occasionally TOO simple), but it has a lush oceanic beauty and an innocent sweetness that really capture your heart and imagination.<br /><br />A little boy named Sosuke finds a tiny \\"goldfish\\" with a human face on a beach, trapped in a bottle. He names her Ponyo, and goes to great lengths to care for his little fishy friend.<br /><br />But then the sea wizard Fujimoto, Ponyo's overprotective dad, appears and snatches Ponyo back into the sea -- and she decides that she wants to become human so she can be with Sosuke. Having tasted a bit of Sosuke's blood, she sprouts chickenleggy limbs and starts to change, but inadvertently disrupts a magical well that causes the moon to drop, the seas to rise over the land, and prehistoric magic to rise once more.<br /><br />Sosuke and Ponyo are delighted to be reunited, despite the raging storm that is engulfing the city and causing ships to go missing. While the children go searching for Sosuke's missing mother, Fujimoto struggles to fix the balance of nature before the entire world is destroyed, with the help of Ponyo's sea goddess mother. The only hope of restoring balance lies in Ponyo and Sosuke -- and if Sosuke's love is not true, then Ponyo will be reduced to sea foam.<br /><br />Compared to Miyazaki's other movies, \\"Ponyo\\" is a very simple story -- it's basically a boy-meets-fishgirl story, with lots of children running around being adorable (\\"He HATES humans and he put me in a BUBBLE!\\"). Even its theme is simple -- the story is dependent on on true selfless love and how it knows no boundaries of age, experience or even species. Not to mention parents letting go of their children.<br /><br />If there's a downside to the story, it's the lack of internal conflict. Example: the \\"test\\" that Fujimoto and the sea goddess use for Sosuke... well, it's far less impressive than it seems.<br /><br />And Miyazaki does not disappoint animationwise -- he conjures a waterworld of luminous sea life, sparkling ships, prehistoric creatures, finned submarines and a town that has been swallowed by the sea (complete with boats floating over the rooftops). It's an exquisite piece of work that turns the ocean into a magical, otherworldly realm where wizards work in coral-encrusted towers and shimmering jellyfish take little mermaids to the surface.<br /><br />Ponyo herself provides a lot of the movie's charm -- she's effusive, hyperactive, has a babylike fascination with the human world (\\"HAM!\\"), and an array of handy magical powers. Sosuke is a likable lad who is fascinated by Ponyo and her world, and Fujimoto makes a enjoyable anti-hero -- spindly, gaunt and with a mane of messy red hair, he's like a rock'n'roll embodiment of parental stress.<br /><br />As for the voice actors, most of them do a brilliant job. Noah Cyrus and Frankie Jonas do a decent though not outstanding job as the lead characters, but they are easily outstripped by a harried-sounding Liam Neeson, loving Tina Fey, and smooth, lulling Cate Blanchett as a trio of worried parents who deeply love their children (whether human or fish).<br /><br />\\"Ponyo\\" is simpler and more childlike fare than most of Miyazaki's past films, but it's still a sweet and lushly-animated piece of work. At the very least, it will transport you to a magical childhood.ownside to the story, it's the lack of internal conflict.

B0020MKTOS|5.0|This movie was a lot better than I thought it would be! It had a great storyline, good message, some funny moments, and some heart-breaking moments. Clint Eastwood was awesome as Walt Kowalski, a Korean War veteran who is very cranky, grumpy, and racist. He lives in a neighborhood dominated by poor Asian immigrants and infested with gangs. A young Hmong boy named Thao Lor who agrees to an initiation which requires him to steal Walt's prized car, a 1972 Ford Gran Torino, but Walt stops him. Walt finally befriends Thao's family, and tries to help Thao become a man, and learn responsibility. When a Hmong gang threatens the Lor family, Walt knows what he must do. I highly recommend GRAN TORINO!!!

B000AJIF4E|3.0|I think these are fine headphones for the price and they seem to cancel out almost all external sounds, however, when they arrived they seemed to have a \\"screw loose\\" in one side and I hear a rattling when I move them around.I am contacting the manufacturer today and hopeful they will send me a new pair.<br /><br />I am using them for recording VO directly from my MAC and I think they will work well once I sort out this problem.
B000002U82|5.0|There is something magical about this album.  The creative genius and lyricist that is Roger Waters; the etheral, melancholy guitar sounds by David Gilmour; the beautifully composed piano and keyboard pieces by Rick Wright; or the simple but effective percussion by Nick Mason - this is Pink Floyd's best work in my opinion.  I don't think this because it's their best selling album of all time, but when I listen to it, it actually SOUNDS like their most collaborative work; you can hear where each of them put their mark on it.    It's also the first Pink Floyd album where they really developed that very recognizable \\"Floyd sound.\\" If you love Pink Floyd, you understand what I'm talking about. It's focused, it's groundbreaking for it's time, and more important - it's timeless.  Everything from the guitar solos, the lyrics, the transitions, the \\"voices\\" - it's catchy and simple but it moves you.  If you don't already have this in your music collection, I suggest you download it or pick it up ASAP.  It might just change your life.

B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Michael Moore must have ESP. He is spot-on in his movie \\"Sicko\\" when he lambastes the USA's for-profit health insurers and for-profit hospitals. Watching his 3-year-old movie and watching the on-going current (August 2009) healthcare debate is absolutely mind-boggling! Everyone who wants to know the truth about our disgusting, unfair, inefficient, and bloated health delivery system should watch this movie. Michael Moore's directorial and editorial prowess are without parallel! As the richest, most industrialized country on the face of the Earth - it's disgusting that we don't have FREE medical care for all - and \\"Sicko\\" hits a home run in its depiction of the sorry state of our healthcare system. Watch this movie!.

B000PMLFRA|3.0|Virtually all artists I've listened to insist on how when they look back at any piece of work they've done there are things that they would like to change. Usually they can't. If they're really smart they realise they shouldn't. Why? Because time is linear and finite and we should embrace it as such, not contest the laws of physics trying to go virtually back in time to fix something. Otherwise you'll get stuck in a loop, because as you change as a person, your perception of your past work will change and if you then go and change it you'll keep changing things for ever. I've been looking through the list of changes made to the films over time as listed in the Wikipedia (possibly incomplete) and this is exactly what George Lucas is doing to the original trilogy.    So basically by constantly changing the films he doesn't let them live on as the works of art they are. Thus for me they are dead.    Finally, I want to clarify I completely embrace re-mastering and restoration efforts of film in general. I can also perfectly understand a director's edition of a film (they didn't get to do what they want the first time around) or even a new edit once in a lifetime, but constant tinkering with something is another very different thing.

B0008KLVG4|5.0|From the first killing to John Williams' fantastic theme, there has yet to be a shark movie that combines suspense, action and drama. What makes this so much better than the sequels and recent movies that feature killer sharks (and I know other people have said this but not me) is that they don't show the shark until the movie's almost over! I mean, you know what's killing these people but you have no idea of the size of this thing until it pops up out of the water when Schieder's throwing the chum. I think all the horror/slasher films need to take a lesson from this; don't show the monster all the time because the people will never get scared. People are afraid of the unknown, so if you show people getting killed off but don't show who or what's doing it, then you'll get a bigger scare out of them when you do finally show it. Anyway, enough prattling on how good suspense should be done. Roy Schieder gives a great performance as Chief Brody. He's an average person thrust into this extraordinary situation. Robert Shaw is off his is rocker as Quint (a complete opposite compared to his role in From Russia with Love). And Richard Dreyfuss is down to Earth and believable as Hooper. All three actors have great chemistry together when they're on the boat. The shark, while not sleek looking by today's standards of special effects (God awful CGI would probably replace the model if this film gets remade and we'd probably see the shark every waking moment), is very believeable in its few moments on screen. And I think the shark roars or makes some weird sound when it busts through the boat right before Brody thrusts the air tank in its mouth. I might be wrong though.
B00003CXXP|5.0|And that question is, \\"what is one's responsibility to those that love you?\\"  With a plot neatly developed and characters that make sense, the movie is nicely constructed. So well constructed that it allows you to be absorbed in the story, so that when the end comes, you move, seamlessly, into that emotional state so necessary to truly understand the movie. If you're wise, you emerge from the film looking at your wife, husband, brother or sister, your cat--someone that you know loves you unconditionally [if you're lucky]--differently, with a new appreciation for that love which you allowed yourself to take for granted like so much extra clothing or tatty furniture. In sum, the movie could be--without overstating the case--something resembling a life changing experience.
B000RJO57I|5.0|This movie is such a halarious movie. I concider myself lucky to have stumbled upon it. This movie is a comedy action movie following the life of two cops and their time at a \\"perfect town\\". I can't wait to show my firends and family this movie.

B0028K31CE|3.0|I love Maxwell and I have waited for YEARS for him to put out a new cd.  With that being said, I was not really happy with this cd.  There more songs I did not like than I did. However, the songs I did like on the cd was worth the buy.
B002BIULQ2|5.0|I am a grandmother of 4 children and I took them to see Hannah Montana.  I loved this movie as much as they did.  Anyone, any age, would enjoy this movie.  Family values rule in this movie.  All the actors did a great job.  I heard a lot of laughter in the theatre from folks.  Although this movie is funny, there were a couple of times I almost lost it too.  When Miley sings \\"The Climb\\", I wanted to cry.  Don't think you are too old to watch Hannah Montana because you are not.  You do not have to be a fan of the show to enjoy this movie.  I am not going to say any more about the plot as the other reviewers have done that.  Just go watch the movie!!!  It is great and I am ordering this to have in my collection at home.
B00068NVI4|2.0|Don't understand how folks can say this is so good.  Besides Anderson being mixed way to high (which can be annoying - always looked at his voice as another instrument -  to be blended in with everything else) -  the rest of the mix is very mushy.  One of those 'you can hear everything -  but you can't hear anything'  mixes.  Drums almost non-existant.    The performance is good. But if you want a really great sounding live performance of YES -  the live at Montreaux DVD is it. Other than the fact that the for the first half of the show the camera never focuses on Squire (weird) the sound is almost flawless.  The drums sound particularly good in Montreaux -  and overall, it's all good -  way better than Tsongas.
B000005HFH|5.0|Does Chet Baker play the way he sings? Or does he sing the way he plays? Whatever the answer, this is a tremendous collection of songs and some of the best singing to come out of the fifties hands down.<br /><br />When Astrud Gilberto took on the role of vocalist in the early 1960's, people were either mesmerized or dejected by what they heard, and Baker is no different. There's no gray area when it comes to his singing. You either like it or you don't.<br /><br />For me, there is a quiet, gentle beauty in Baker's voice that, like Gilberto's, projects fragility and longing. Don't get hung up on the myth of Baker's life, simply listen to what's there. And what's there is really there.<br /><br />As for the playing itself, Baker's soloing provides its own insightful commentary on the lyrics. That's part of the beauty of this recording. One seems to complement the other so easily; the strangely interchangeable nature of Baker's playing and singing make it hard to recognize one from the other.<br /><br />And as a final footnote to any would be romantics, I have yet to meet a woman who wasn't seduced by this music in less than two or three songs...  ;)

B002BIULQ2|2.0|As an inveterate insomniac, I'll admit to having caught all the reruns of Hannah Montana on late night Disney Channel, and I was won over not only by Miley Cyrus' perky charms but by a show that captured some of the broad but nevertheless character-driven style of classic 1960s television. So, I approached Hannah Montana: The Movie with the expectations of having a bit more fun than I did watching the Lizze Maguire movie, and that one wasn't all that bad. What a disappointment! Hannah Montana: The Movie tosses out nearly all the successful ingredients of the TV series, reducing nearly all the show's supporting characters to cameo roles. Even Jason Earles, who plays Miley's brother and frequently is responsible for generating the show's biggest laughs, seems to have been largely left on the cutting room floor. And I may have stumbled into the truth there. Hannah Montana: The Movie is so choppily-edited and so poorly structured, I think there might be an entirely better, if perhaps sillier movie on that same cutting room floor. Who knows? What we're left with is an overly serious Miley returning to her country roots, and the overlong scenes of her cornpone family strumming guitars and singing country songs are such a white-folks-got-soul cliche, they must be some kind of reverse racism. Miley remains as cute as a button, but we don't even get her usual fashion parade here. She looks distressingly like, well, just a normal girl. Surprisingly, her dad Billy Ray Cyrus comes off best, the warm charm of his TV persona translating nicely to the big screen. He's a great TV dad. But you'll have more fun watching four or five episodes of the Hannah Montana TV series than watching this movie.

The story is lame, there is no humor, and really no message at all.  I found this film very depressing and dark.  With a title like \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" I expected a feel-good comedy with a message.  What I got was a depressing, dark, film with no story.  Sorry I wasted my time and money!
B000002KKS|5.0|I am amazed. Typically, a band goes through a major change and it would mean the death of the band. It is truly hard to replace a member, especially someone like the lead singer. Sabbath did it!!!!! And, they did it in style. Ronnie James Dio is a master on stage. A very fresh appoach to Sabbath giving a distinct feel to the music, the performance live was incredible. Dio of course, was a seasoned veteran, working with  Ritchie Blackmore(Rainbow, Deep Purple) and of course Dio! I believe Dio took Sabbath to a new level. Look at what's touring today! Don't get me wrong. I really like Sabbath with Ozzy. But, something went wrong. Do we really want that relayed in future music. Ozzy did great on his own and I appreciate what has been done. My choice though has to go with Sabbath as far as choice of show. I believe they stuck to their guns and wrote music that fits what they intendend to write. Listen to what is produced today. How much different is it from 1980? Likely not much. Holding true is tough. Apparantly, this is the road that Sabbath decided to follow.<br /><br />I saw Sabbath with both Ozzy and Dio. Sorry hardcore fans, but I have to choose Dio for the show. Even the sound seemed better. I ask with a truly heavy heart to the fans of Ozzy to think this through and consider. Think to when you were at the show and think of what happened between Ozzy and Dio. My favorite Sabbath though is still \\"Sabbath, We Sold Our Souls for Rock and Roll\\". If anything, Pop it into your car and enjoy the ride. It is a treat!!!! I leave it at this.
0618918248|5.0|Is there a God or even a god?  It's a big question that's beyond the scope of a single Amazon review.  If you asked Richard Dawkins, however, he'd say no.  His book, The God Delusion, is his reasonably well-reasoned argument in favor of his position.    \\"Reason\\" is the key word here.  Dawkins takes an essentially scientific approach to the question.  Faith means little to him; evidence is everything.  With this approach, he can make a strong case.  Actually, proving the non-existence of God is not necessary, as proving a negative is nearly impossible.  Instead, it is the responsibility of the believers in God's existence to prove their case.  Carl Sagan's saying \\"Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof\\" holds here, as it does with those who try to prove alien visitations or the effectiveness of dowsing.    Dawkins's assertion is that no such evidence of God exists.  The biggest attempt at scientifically proving God's existence, the dressed-up version of Creationism called Intelligent Design, fails on a number of levels.  All other evidence can be shown to be hoaxes or delusions.  Of course, if you believe in a god (or a flying spaghetti monster), faith may trump reason.  After all, an all-powerful God could be truly supernatural, that is, beyond nature and therefore beyond scientific constraints.    Many atheists actually seem less concerned with whether God exists as with the effects of believing in such a God, which is to say religion.  They've little good to say about these religions and argue that the seeming benefits of religion (such as moral codes) do not actually require religion to come about.  Dawkins makes this case as well, but he's also out to prove that there is no proof of God.      Overall, he does a good job of it, too, though my guess is that he won't sway many true believers.  As a writer, Dawkins does a decent job, though I feel the book sags a bit in the middle when he rehashes the many familiar (to readers of this type of book) arguments against intelligent design. It's an uphill battle to try and eliminate God, but Dawkins tackles it with vigor and a good sense of humor.
0756405890|2.0|I have to agree with other critics who found it be lacking...well, a plot.  The first 30 pages are very promising, but then...nothing really happens.  I like the idea and the characters, and the world and mythology he creates are intriguing.  Maybe this will build to something by book 2 or 3.  But 700 pages without any suspense, climactic scenes or pulse-pounding encounters...no real battles, confrontations.  In other words, no real plot development to keep you reading.  A lot of \\"Oliver Twist\\" scenes of an orphan on his own followed by Harry Potter-esque scenes at University.  Where's the suspense?  Where's the villain?  Full disclosure - I only made it halfway through.  If a book hasn't grabbed me by 350 pages, I'm done.
B002DKF47O|5.0|Whether you can stand Behemoth's aural assault or not, you've got to give them credit. Its been nearly two decades since they began (as a horrible black metal band, mind you), and now just look at 'em, all grown up and ranked amongst the death metal elite. Some would brand them a Morbid Angel clone, but I say that Behemoth surpass and outshine a band like Morbid Angel, but I'd say they surpass them and have a more unique and original sound that has not been emulated by any other band to this day.    Their war-metal, blasphemous, eastern-tinged sound that they've introduced and honed on albums like [[ASIN:B00070Q8DQ Demigod]] and [[ASIN:B000R7I2I8 The Apostasy]] is in full force on their ninth LP Evangelion; Nergal's vocals are as hoarse and commanding as ever, like a sorcerer summoning forth the power of the Void itself; his lyrics a dark testament to the ancient times of humanity and religion. Inferno's drumming is as blisteringly fast as ever, with lightning fast double bass kicks, sharp, machine gun snares, and blast beats galore. On top of all that the guitars are just as technical, just as amazing, and playing those truly awesome and unique guitar riffs that we have come to associate with Behemoth.    The word that comes to mind when listening to Evangelion is majestic. The drums and guitars ebb and flow in a wave of death metal that is not only technical and brutal in its execution, but melodious and alluring, no doubt enhanced by the excellent production of the album; though I still wish the bass guitar was more audible, because their bassist is amazing, when you can hear him. Inferno's drumming is another highlight of the band's sound, and its some of the most chaotic and speedy, yet utterly precise drumming that I've ever heard. The drumming patterns that blew my mind on their previous two albums are in full force here, and its no less impressive. Equally intense are the guitars, switching from tremolo picking to death metal riffing with sheer precision andmastery; also the solos are quite nice, technical and fitting. The stunning thing about the guitar work is its ability to sound technical and heavy without losing melody and humanity; something that happens to many death metal bands. Nergal's vocals, which range from howls to his trademark scream are overdubbed and very commanding, providing a war-chant like quality to the songs. They are the essence of Behemoth's sound, and there is no other vocalist in the industry that can even come close to his demonic singing style. His lyrics are equally impressive, dabbling in the usual esoteric and archaic topics, adding another layer of epic to the overall sound.    Aside from the core aesthetics of the band, its the little things that really stand out; like the gang vocals on the album opener 'Daimonos', or the sitar outro on 'Shemhamforash', or the haunting breakdown on 'The Seed Ov I'. Another surprise is the track 'Ov Fire and The Void' which sounds like blackened death metal filtered through a pop music sensibility, and 'Lucifer', a slow, plodding and haunting ending to the album. Overall, Evangelion is a more mature album in terms of songwriting and execution; a smooth progression from the sound they introduced on Demigod.    Evangelion is a testament to the band's skill, showing us a more mature and able band who has mastered their craft of writing epic song structures, blistering blackened death metal and offering up a juicy slab of technical music that doesn't sacrifice melody and feeling for sheer brutality. Over two decades Behemoth have gone from that uncomfortable black metal band to the blackened death metal elite, and it fits them quite nicely.    Highly Recommended    5/5
B001PPF12Q|4.0|Radiohead<br />OK Computer Collector's Edition Disc 2; 2009<br />Capitol Records<br /><br />My Rating: 71/100<br /><br />OK, we get it now. Radiohead is a great b-side band. With this round back in 97/98, Radiohead proved themselves to be a fanboy's dream. The three P's - \\"Pearly,\\" \\"Polyethylene\\", and \\"Palo Alto\\" - are fabulous cross-eyed rock songs, while \\"A Reminder\\" is one of the most gorgeous tracks the band has ever recorded. They showcases a penchant for the quiet and powerful on \\"Melatonin\\" and \\"How I Made My Millions,\\" and \\"Lull\\" is just a brilliant little throwaway. Still, what this disc shows more than anything is that Radiohead was experiencing the kind of once-in-a-lifetime inspiration that most bands never experience. My only gripe with the collection over all is that it covers previously released material. Surely there's something lost in the vaults from the OKC sessions that could stand the light of day? \\"Big Boots?\\" \\"Lift?\\" \\"Follow Me Around?\\" \\"I Promise?\\"<br /><br />PS The live tracks are pretty great as well.<br /><br />PPS The ZERO 7 remix is worth it, the FILA BRAZILA remix is dull.<br /><br />TRACKS<br /><br />1.

B000B8QEYC|5.0|First off, I'm a new Enya fan... just this year. Yeah, I'm also the LotR freak, so I've heard Aniron, May it Be, and practically drooled over them... very lovely. That wasn't enough to get me into 'Enya'. I am also a huge lover of music, I own all three of the LotR complete recordings... I go for music. I love music. I'm also very conservative. I don't listen to rock... just hymns and some soundtrack... Narnia's first two scores were something of a disappointment. So, I'm picky. Yes, it's true... I don't go for guady jewelry, I don't like banging music. I like soft, quite, thoughtful, or happy and chipper. I am a die-hard for sad music too. I want something to make me cry. I was given Celtic Woman and expected a lot, I was disappointed. Only two songs I would ever buy... so, when I got into Enya I wasn't expecting to like every single song except one in all of her albums.<br /><br />Enya is... well... Enya paints pictures in my mind. I see a scene of nature or between people everytime I hear the song. She inspires me to go write on my book... Amarantine is perfect. I love the songs...<br /><br />1. Less than a pearl<br />this song is the perfect adventure, either that or it's provoking you to stand out in the middle of the sunlight with your arms spread out, your head back, singing to the sky.<br /><br />2. Amarantine<br />A lovely, sometimes hyper song, with an eeire chourous. It's perfect for any helpless romantic... I'm not one of those, but hey! it is Enya! I love her music, I love this song!<br /><br />3. It's in the rain<br />sigh... the words to this song... every time it rains I begin this song in my head. So lovely, sorta peaceful. I can see the rain drops dripping from leaves.<br /><br />4. If I could be where you are<br />a lovely song, but it's not my top fav...<br /><br />5. The river sings<br />a highly celtic twist. Very lively. Makes me want to dance around somehow. Enya's good at that. Makes you want to go on an adventure, even when you stubornly say no to her, she takes you with her anyways.<br /><br />6. Long long journey<br />I think Enya must have written this for Bilbo Baggins. I see scenes from The Hobbit everytime I listen to this. It begins with city lights upon the harbour... and I see Bywater reflecting the lights of Hobbiton in RotK at the end when the Hobbits are at The Green Dragon. The courous shows you Bilbo's steps from The Mountain and There and Back Again... this is Enya's hobbit-walking song!<br /><br />7. Sumiregusa<br />Lovely! where Less than a pearl makes you look up at the sky, this has you looking for violets in the wild woods.<br /><br />8. Someone said goodbye<br />this is my absolute favourite. it's sad and desperate, and I probably shouldn't go on about it forever! But... it's Cooper who's singing this to a friend, Samantha, or Pepper Darcy... her husband's died. She's alone... she's lost... she doesn't know why. Her dreams won't fly, her heart cries, she won't say goodbye to anyone, and for the life of her, Pepper can't figure out why! Neither can Cooper.<br /><br />9. A moment lost<br />another great song... Tom regrets... he's ruined Awel's life, and he can never change it... his moment was lost.<br /><br />10. Drifting<br />no real opinion. It does feel like your moving about in the water, somehow...<br /><br />11. Amid the falling snow<br />This is a very white song! I love the strings here. it should have been The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe's credit song! It gives me chills.<br /><br />12. Water shows the hidden heart<br />Somehow this feels elvish, in a strange way. It's lovely, but again, this isn't my top favourite, but I still like it anyhow<br /><br />From where the Willows weep (and yes, Enya SHOULD make an album, call it that, and send me a copy : )<br />Ithilwen~y  I think Enya must have written this for Bilbo Baggins.

B000A2RRF4|5.0|This was a Great DVD.... But... I played it ONE time and it was fine. The SECOND time I played it IT WOULD NOT PLAY. I looked at it VERY CAREFULLY and there was NO SCRATCHES. I ended up buying another as it would of cost more in shipping and been a pain to have to do than it was worth. But.... it was frustrating.
0446402397|1.0|To put it simply, I'm shocked and amazed at the rave reviews this book has gotten.  Perhaps the praise is for the plot, but I suppose I'll never know because I gave up after page 30.    I don't think I've ever picked up a published book that was written this poorly.  I teach writing classes, was an English major in college, and write for a living, so I do tend to have a critical eye when it comes to these things.  From the first few pages, it's obvious that this is the work of a first-time writer.  The prose is flat, stumbling, and amateurish.  What really amazed me, though, were all the grammar and punctuation errors.  Yes, I know that fiction authors---especially those purporting to write \\"literature\\"---can take poetic license in their writing, but this book is filled with mistakes so glaring that I couldn't possibly go past the first few chapters.  I found myself wondering, where was the editor?  Even if the plot and characters were excellent, this book needed much, much more work before it was ever published.  As it reads now, it's just sloppy.
B001U7FWM8|5.0|More and more often music is referenced by other bands- \\"oh, it sounds like so and so\\" or \\"so and so is the new blahblah\\". Grizzly Bear manages to sidestep these identifiers creating it's own music without falling into the pit of preconceived notions genres create. When I first started telling people about Grizzly Bear i'd find myself at a loss for words when asked to describe what it sounded like. Expansive, harmonic, folkish (we won't use the term \\"Freak Folk\\" here), rockish, but always elusively avoiding falling into one definitive sound, which is the strength of this album as well as the previous one. Ideally, bands will evolve and not keep putting out different versions of the same album year after year, and Veckatimest successfully takes the next step. While their first widely known album Yellow house was soaring and symphonic, Veckatimest manages to ground itself in earthier sounds. There's a richness to the layers and layers of harmony, the syncopation of the rhythms and the contrast of frontman Ed Droste's expansively melodic voice to Daniel Rossen's sharper timbre.   I admit it took several listenings to really begin to appreciate the sensitivity of the music on Veck. I was attached to the rich softness of Yellow house, the ease with which one could sink into the cradle of sound. Veckatimest is harder, a bit more masculine, but still possessing the uniqueness of their previous work. Funnily, I noticed this most when I would put my ipod on shuffle, and all of a sudden i'd find myself drawn into a song, and have to check to see who it was since I hadn't yet memorized all the songs on the album. Inevitably, it was Veckatimest.   This album is not a complete departure from their previous work, but rather a continuation, and therefore a worthwhile investment. It's rare that you find music that incorporates so many different elements into one beautiful package.
B002SJIO5E|5.0|District 9 is the best Sci Fi film that I've seen in years. The greatness of movies like Bladerunner, Star Wars or E.T. was the humanity on display and the mirrors that they offered into real life. District 9 falls into this catagory. Taking place in Johannesburg, South Africa, we follow a story already in progress. The aliens are already here. The communication gap has been bridged. The \\"prawns\\" have been segregated and reside in slums where life is miserable. The plot line revolves around our protagonists initial efforts to relocate the \\"prawns\\" from District 9 to District 10, essentially a concentration camp located 200km away from town.     The main character played by Sharlto Copley, Wikus undergoes a transformationn on screen that has to be seen to be believed. Without spoiling any plot points, I will say that it is remarkable that the character depicted in the first 20 minutes and played at the end are the same person. The \\"prawn\\" characters are amazing as well. As intended, I initially looked at every appearance on screen as disturbing. They were ugly, hateful, vile creatures. As the film plays out, you begin to feel sympathy for them and root for them. Then you realise that their success in what we are shown would probably represent the end of humanity. It's amazing how the creators of the film are able to suck you into this story when there is basically one human dominating the screen and several seven foot tall bi-ped lobsters.     The film looks great. Although a portion of the film is told through hand held camera, broadcast news style and documentary, about midway through the film, it moves to a more traditional style. The imagery is amazing. Like Bladerunner, this world feels real, despite being science fiction. Everything from the aliens to their weapons to the space craft look terrific. I imagined the film at a $100-$125 million budget. I was shocked to hear it was done for $30 million. It also has to be mentioned that the level of gore hear excedes many modern horror films. There are scenes of torture on both humans and aliens. Niether are easy to watch. The action scenes are amazing, but again, exceptionally graphic.       District 9 is the type of disc that you purchase to showcase your system. Becuase parts of D9 are shown in a gritty documentary style, you might think BluRay would be a waste. When not told in documentary style, D9 looks superb, and for those who can't figure out the difference in low and hi resolution images, there are some great contrasts here that really that show off blu rays power. It also should be noted that the film is shown at 1:85 aspect ratio, that means the entire screen is full - no noticible black bars. The only other Blu Ray that I can remember showing like this is The Dark Knight, perhaps the best Blu Ray ever. I also need to mention the sound as it is dynamite throughout - especially the sound variances from the documentary to traditional movie portions. D9 is loaded with BR only extras. BDLive has multiple online components including a very cool \\"pop up video\\" style feature that lets you look at a variety of facts about the movie and actors. There are also the standard features that include a digital copy, director commentary and deleted scenes. There are also some D9 features that I imagine are on the standard DVD as well, maps and other geek out features.     Despite a beginning that may feel a bit slow to non genre fans, District 9 is the rare combination of great story, actors and special effects. Simply brilliant, one of the best movies I've ever seen and I'm really glad that the BluRay release lives up to the movie's quality throughout.
B0000009SM|5.0|I love this album!  I used to listen to it way back in the 80's!  I had to buy it and it is as good as I remembered it.  Zappa goes from jazz to funk to symphonic all in one album!
B001LYD2JU|4.0|Michael Schenker's first solo record after he left UFO. This is a classic hard rock cd, a must have for anyone who loves great guitar playing. Songs like, into the arena, lost horizons, armed and ready, bijou pleasurette, and tales of mystery are my favorite of this 9 song disc. I must say the production of this cd makes Judas Priest's British steel sound like \\" The Wall (Bob Ezrin)\\". Cry for the nations opening keyboard line sounds like it was recorded on a 12 inch casio. Outside of that song Schenkers gift for writting makes up for the production errors. Just like Uli Roth \\" early scorpions \\" Al De'meola, Michael Schenker was one of the first neo-classical players on the scene.
B0026LYM5U|4.0|I've been listening to this for awhile now, and I must say, I like it a lot.  My complaint about The Gathering since Mandylion/Birds is that they don't totally kick out the jams and rock enough, they're always restrained and measured, and my initial response to West Pole was exactly that - turn up the volume and smash it for chrissake.  There are parts here that do pound pretty good in spots, like \\"All You Are\\", but they're mixed so dense into the fabric that you need to push the volume real high to get that feeling out of it.  That said, there are more growling guitars here than in the last several CD's, and I like that, I'm a guitar kind of guy.<br /><br />Once I got past what I wanted this to be (Nightime Birds 2) and got used to what it is, it grew on me, as Gathering albums tend to do.  The quality of the song writing is very good here in a subtle way, hooks that beguile.  You can tell when something clicks when you find yourself with a passage rolling around in your brain without really thinking about it, as the title song has been doing all week (though today it seems to be the coda from \\"Constant Run\\").  In fact, as an album of songs as opposed to themes, this CD is as close to \\"Birds\\" as they've come since.  If this is an example of the songwriting we can expect in the future, I'll gladly take more in this vein.  Just a little crunchier please.<br /><br />Kudos to Silje Wergeland, that's like replacing Brett Favre at quarterback, and she pulls it off seamlessly, at least in the studio (from what I've seen live, she lacks Anneke's power).  Another good show, from a band that simply does not miss.
1594202249|4.0|You can feel the clamor on the day a Pynchon novel is released.  By this time (of my own review), most of the Pynchonites have inhaled Inherent Vice and likely reviewed it. Er, I was kind of slow on the uptake.  I admit--writing this review is largely a way to share the vibe, a nod to posterity.  Add to the queue and tip a hat to TP and my fellow readers.<br /><br />What can I say about his new release that is going to limn the ebullient, esoteric, burlesque brilliance that is Pynchon?  Inherent Vice is Pynchon being Pynchon--a little more compact, a smoother flow for the previously uninitiated, a minor disappointment? for lovers of Gravity's Rainbow.  This novel still contains disparate threads, hilarious uptakes, pause for lyrics and digressions--but it gets back on track--no deep rabbit holes here. The focus is tighter than usual, ultimately concentrating on Doc Sportello and his comically dangerous adventures as a PI in LA. The narrative flow favors cinematic appeal, also--there is an essentially linear progression of a noirish detective story.  Moreover, it is an exhilarating homage to the sixties.  There is enough pot smoking and acid dropping to leave traces on the reader's fingers as the pages turn. There's surf to roar in your ears; babes and bikinis and beaches; bad guys and moral ambiguity; greed and dirty money; and a savior or two.  I don't read Pynchon for the plots, but Inherent Vice actually has a fairly strong one, a main one, that keeps you guessing.<br /><br />If you haven't yet plunged into Pynchon, this isn't a bad place to start.  It's a jubilant paean to sex, drugs, surfing, and rock 'n roll. A stoner's tribute. Additionally, it embodies the trademark ribald, madcap mayhem and debauchery along with outlaw erudition and addiction inherent to the verse of Thomas Pynchon.
B0013FFMOK|4.0|I liked this movie, it was a semi-realistic take on the end of the world vampire movie.  Who knows with the crap drug companies come up with now a days this could be a possibility for our future.  Who's to say what happens after their done messing up everyone's health care.  This movie was pretty good for a man and his dog, it made me look twice before entering a dark room.  There was one thing that I questioned, if you were driving North up the East coast and the bridges and tunnels of New York city had been blown up, that would make it pretty hard to make it to the City, not impossible but pretty hard with flesh eating vampires on the loose.  Great special effects though, it was a good movie, I would not buy the DVD but I did pay to rent it and it was well worth it.
B0013FSL0C|5.0|Good series, worth watching on DVD if you missed the telecasts on Showtime.   I watched the second season on Showtime so wanted to catch up.  Somewhat addicting and lots of material, nine DVDs.  The show is about four people in analysis, one at a time.  It also includes a fifth, the doctor himself.    Believe it or not, I think the series gets better in the second season, unlike many ongoing shows that often peak in the first season.
0385341008|5.0|Phenomenal book - once I grasped the storyline, within the first 10 pages, I was hooked. It tackles a difficult subject matter (WWII and post occupation) in a humane and human manner. The authors do such a good job of integrating fact and fiction, making the story flow smoothly and believably. Though not classified as a romance, there are definitely romantic elements in the book. However, the romance is not limited to a personal dating style relationship. I found romance in the language when describing the land, the people in the community, their relationship with a beloved child, and the idea of letter writing. Using letters as the guide, the reader is exposed to many viewpoints other characters don't get to know. As a result, we have the inside scoop and are truly made to feel as though we are there and know them very well.<br /><br />Such a good book; can't wait to talk about with the book club! Will be recommending this one to a wide variety of readers too, as it has so many distinctive aspects, many will enjoy.
0786838655|4.0|I've read the 1st 3 books so far. The story line and the things that happen are completely derivative of Harry Potter. But, the books are a good read any way. As a grown-up, the books challenge me to remember my Greek mythology classes. My 11-yr-old is learning mythology in a fun way. I'm also using it as a chance to teach him the origins of some of our words, such as \\"tantalize\\". I don't think he'll ever forget that word!     Just as West Side Story is still enjoyable, even right after you've read the original Romeo and Juliet, these books can stand on their own.
B001ILHY1I|5.0|Surprisingly good remake of an old Sylvester Stallone movie (Death Race 2000, I believe).  This movie is packed full of action and has a simple enough story that it is quickly established for the audience and quickly moves to action, action, action.  The concept seems like a mix between The Running Man and the Twisted Metal video games.  The main character is framed for murder and sent to jail where he gets thrown into a brutal game of survival and hopefully freedom (sounds like the Running Man, huh?) and the cars are racing around with an arsenal of weaponry and armor on a race course with it's own hidden dangers.  The races are amazing to watch and the \\"weapons\\" and \\"armor\\" and \\"death\\" symbols cars must cross over to allow use of their cars' related function brings to mind the Twisted Metal video game.  This movie was done very well and I would definitely have to recommend it.
0061767581|4.0|I'm a huge fan of Lauren Conrad and The Hills so I thought this book would be super interesting and give a little more \\"background\\" on her life.    I thought the story was pretty good, it definitely gave you a \\"behind the scenes\\" glimpse at reality television. However, it was slightly lacking creativity in some sections. Pretty much the same ol' stuff you saw on Laguna Beach/The Hills in a fictionalized format. And the ending....wasn't really an ending.    Definitely not the best book I've read. It's an extremely easy read (it only took me like 4 hours to finish it). If you are out of things to read or just really bored then go ahead and give it a go.
6305313687|4.0|Edward Norton is a fabulous actor, yet his portrayal as an angry, hate-filled skinhead in AMERICAN HISTORY X may be his best, most powerful performance.  Norton so immerses himself in the role of a young man feeling disenfranchised from his culture and society that his racist rants take on a surreal logic all their own; one of the primary reasons this is such a disturbing film.<br /><br />The interracial interaction and tension is as volatile as it is believable, making the first half of the film extremely uncomfortable to watch.  Stacy Keach playing a cold, cunning, calculating mentor to the skinhead gang is extremely effective, and Edward Furlong is compelling as Norton's impressionable younger brother.  The brothers come from a highly dysfunctional family, matriarched by a frightened, unstable mother (Beverly D'Angelo).  Once Norton's character is sent to prison for gunning down two African Americans, AMERICAN HISTORY X takes a decided turn, as the protagonist experiences a reawakening--and a very ironic friendship.<br /><br />Upon his release our main character has a much different outlook on life, yet cannot turn his younger brother away from years of indoctrinated hate, and the film moves relentlessly toward its hopelessly tragic (and horrific) conclusion.  One does indeed reap what one sows--a powerful lesson to take from AMERICAN HISTORY X, a compelling, engrossing, yet disturbing film.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning
0061854549|5.0|Dan Ariely has hit a perfect tone in presenting solid research to a wide audience. Predicatbly Irrational is a fun read, and at the same time a book I would use in a graduate psychology course. On one level this books helps us understand our own, at times, irrational choices, as well as the odd choices made by people around us. After reading this I found that I was able to slow some of my reactions, such as a response to something that is \\"free.\\"<br /><br />There are also, however, deeper application levels of this book. How we present things effects decisions people make, which means that marketing can powerfully influence our choices as well as some of our moral decisions. In this light I found the book insightful about the power of minor suggestion to change an outcome. Anyone invovled in human research will be interested in these findings. Anyone involved in leadership would also benefit from this book, as would any life coach working with people on financial decisions.<br /><br />The book challenges our assumptions about supply and demand, the cost of \\"free\\", the power of social norms, the influence of arousal, the price of ownership, our ability to let a \\"door close\\" behind us, the effect of expectations and a great deal about lying and truth telling.<br /><br />The book is enjoyable to read, well researched and documented. I recommend this book to anyone interested in how they personally make decisions, how other people make seemingly irrational decisions (think Wall Street), as well as anyone interested in social psychology or economic psychology.
B00005YJMX|5.0|Nosferatu: The Vampyre/Phantom Der Nacht (1979) was a great remake which I rate a five star production. This film really captured the essence of the famous original and allowed me to see what the original film maker might have captured on the film if he were making the movie today. The film appears to have been filmed on location in Europe (the castle looks very credible and perhaps found on location??) and this adds to the charm, and in some cases otherworldly effect of the movie which was a shear pleasure to watch.
B0000019HU|3.0|I remember borrowing this cd from my library like five years ago, I really liked it at the time, it has the sort of raw sound that I really liked then. It is still a good cd, but it is not for everyone, even for myself, I don't like it as much as I once did but I can remember why I did.
B001P5Q6F2|5.0|I have had this album for about a month now, and when i first put the cd into my car stereo, i thought it was going to shake it to bits!!! After that first hearing, i thought that the album was just ok... f*#%ing brutal but just ok. i have read other reviews on the album and all have been mixed. but after about the 3rd listen, the album just clicked for me. Yeah, i know that ashes and sacrement are both seriously good albums but this is something different. like all bands, progression is needed, and i don't think LOG are any worse the wear for it. now, every time i listen to it i feel like i have just drank 10 20z double shot espresso's! i can't sit still!!! if you are trying to ween yourself from a coffee problem (like myself) this is a great substitute. this album is soooo damn good (hard to choose but track 7 and 11 are my personal favs) i can't praise it enough.  i never used to like LOG... oh how times have changed. when, not if you buy this album and you aren't sure... be patient you will be.  the best album i have bought for a while, shame i can't give it any more than 5 stars!!! :o)
B00003CXRM|5.0|This movie is very very funny. It is amazing how they use Ulysses as a story base, without making it predictable.
0307266303|5.0|What a great book.  Informative, well written and funny.  And it will change your views about sneakers forever!!!!  A must read for any serious athlete, even if you are not a distance runner [ which I am not! ]
B000002VTE|5.0|There's a show called \\"Sonic Vision\\" that Moby helped put together, and it is a laser show set to psychedelic rock music.  It's put on at a lot of local space centers and observatories, etc.  Anyways, when the song, \\"Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating In Space,\\" comes on during the show it is unforgettable.  One of the most moving experiences I've ever had.  But in this cesspit of an economy it seems everyone is arguing and breaking up.  I'm sure many of you are dealing with something similar, my fiance and I also recently seperated.  All I know is that this album is helping me deal with that.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|This is a great show for the adult fans of Twilight!  The action, adventure, and fun is a great way to sit back and relax!  The books are great too!!!!
B000R8YC18|5.0|This is one of those rare occasions where I will say: \\"If I could give it ten stars I would.\\" Simply put, movies do not get better than this.  The only other movie that I think can compare to this is Shawshank Redemption, as far as greatness goes.  What movie can show what happens to a man who is alone for too long better than this?  On television today you have a thousand stations all broadcasting the same politically correct agenda, over and over until the wheels fall off.  Put on this movie when you need the anti-thesis to all of that.  Perhaps in yesteryears, their was no need for \\"a guy who would not take it\\" so much, because there were simply more of them around.  But if you ask me, in today's world, Travis Bickle is a Saint, not a sociopath.  The real sociopaths all have their own shows on the helevision now.
B0012GMUIG|5.0|Billy Joel's sensational Live Album \\"Songs In the Attic\\" reached NO.8 in 1981 on the BILLBOARD-TOP 10 ALBUM CHARTS! The songs collected here are from Billy's early Albums which never reached the BILLBOARD-TOP 10. Noone really knew the 'Piano Man' that well in the early to mid seventies. But the early songs still made an impact and \\"Songs In the Attic\\" brings them back to life! Here is the rundown on the songs and which albums and years they are from...  1.) \\"Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out On Broadway)\\"= \\"Turnstiles, 1976.\\"  2.) \\"Summer, Highland Falls\\"= \\"Turnstiles, 1976.\\"  3.) \\"Streetlife Serenader\\"= \\"Streetlife Serenade, 1974.\\"  4.) \\"Los Angelenos\\"= \\"Streetlife Serenade, 1974.\\"  5.) \\"She's Got A Way\\"= \\"Cold Spring Harbor, 1971.\\" {This remake hit No.23 on BILLBOARD-TOP 40.}  6.) \\"Everybody Loves You Now\\"= \\"Cold Spring Harbor, 1971.\\"  7.) \\"Say Goodbye To Hollywood\\"= \\"Turnstiles, 1976.\\" {This remake hit No.17 on BILLBOARD-TOP 40.}  8.) \\"Captain Jack\\"= \\"Piano Man, 1973.\\"  9.) \\"You're My Home\\"= \\"Piano Man, 1973.\\"  10.) \\"The Ballad of Billy the Kid\\"= \\"Piano Man, 1973.\\"  11.) \\"I've Loved These Days\\"= \\"Turnstiles, 1976.\\"-------  If you want the original songs and can't find the old Albums at stores.

0385342020|1.0|After reading the first chapter, I knew this was going to be a book that I was going to be waste of time to read. I love Sophie Kinsella's books and she is a favorite author of mine. I was excited when this book was coming out. I like how her characters are quirky, fun and charming. Twenties Girl is pretty awful and the story is somewhat dumb. After reading the comment on the reason why she wrote this book on a comment by her US Editor said she should write a story about a ghost, she should of ignored that comment.     Waiting for a non-ghost story.....
B001JEA7IQ|5.0|This was a favorite when my boys were kids. You recently found a copy for me to send to my great grandson. His reaction, according to his mother, was \\"Oh boy, oh boy!\\" No story line, but lots of pictured objects familiar to a youngster, and the names to accompany them. Good word association.
B0018YIFEK|5.0|\\"My Sister's Keeper\\" is a book that changed my life. The first chapter really grabbed myy attention and pulled me in. It wasn't really a book that I could relate to but it still gave me a taste of some of lifes hardships. With the situations in the book came tears, smiles and small chuckles. This book is a book that I could read all night because of its gread adventures. This is not an easy read, but if read, it will make an impact on you that will change your view of things.

0756405890|5.0|It is rare that I read a book twice, but I've read Name of the Wind twice in the last 8 months.  It is a wonderful page turner, and I'm really looking forward to Day 2 in the series.
B002C2XXJY|1.0|My girlfriend's granddaughter bought this disc and asked me to copy it to her new mp3 player.  When I put the disc in my Linux laptop, I couldn't play or rip the disc.  Why? Because there was no music, only software, Windows software, specifically.    This disc is DRM'd and should be boycotted.
159102594X|5.0|Not for everyone, but definitely for me.    The Blade Itself is powerful in its building of characters and the deeply flawed anti-heroes in its pages. Characters are incredibly deep, with facets to each of them beyond the keen of the average fantasy personaity. The book is worth reading simply because of such characters, but the author truly works his magic and builds a complex, twisted, corrupt world.    Do not look for a happy moments. You will receive a more realistic result, with vulgar honesty and hero crushing elegance.

0226264211|2.0|Let me start out by saying Milton Friedman is a compelling figure who truly wishes for freedom and equal opportunity.  Also, I realize that 'Capitalism and Freedom' was not an academic work in economics but rather a political manifesto for laymen.  That being said...<br /><br />'Capitalism and Freedom' is worthless in both an economic and political sense.  It's imploded ideas still linger on among conservatives and libertarians.  Constant errors in logic and empirical evidence plague the book.  As soon as he begins discussing economic theory it becomes obvious he places personal ideology over academic integrity.<br /><br />A perfect example would be his explanation of the Keynesian Multiplier in his chapter on 'Fiscal Policy'.  When he 'refutes' Keynes and then goes into further detail on what Keynes supposedly did not even mention is bewildering.  Not because he presents a clearly superior argument, his argument is just a restatement of classical theory, but because of his complete lack of understanding regarding chapter 10 of Keynes' GT.  Every point he makes is clearly dealt with by Keynes and sharply criticized.  I was so surprised by his comments I went back and reread chapter 10 just to be sure.  I have no idea why he would write something so misleading and inaccurate.  Significant errors in economic theory are rampant throughout this work.<br /><br />Schlocky logic continues throughout nearly every one of the applied chapters because they are directly based on defunct economic theory.  His last ~7 chapters read like a 20th century continuation of Book 5 in Adam Smith's 'Wealth of Nations'.<br /><br />With all of Friedman's faults the occasional gem does appear.  His analysis of floating exchange rates and fiscal lag periods are still relevant today (but not by as much as he thinks).<br /><br />'Capitalism and Freedom' is an example of a man trying to help mankind but stumbling because of placing ideology above reality.
965006026X|5.0|\\"I conceive, therefore, that a somewhat comprehensive socialization of investment will prove the only means of securing an approximation to full  employment; though this need not exclude all manner of compromises and of devices by which public authority will co-operate with private initiative\\"<br /><br />Keynes' GT argues that the classic theory of laissez-faire is actually a rare case.  His general theory, that a capitalist economy is unstable due to the inherent flaws of capitalism,  is the normal condition.  An objective of full employment, through monetary and fiscal policy, will alleviate the curse of depressions and major recessions.  By allowing government control of output his theory has saved capitalism from demise.<br /><br />It is unfortunate that Keynes' name is used in a modern sense to support actions which he directly refutes in the GT.  A must read for anyone interested in the GT is Hyman Minsky's 'Stabilizing an Unstable Economy'.<br /><br />Sidenote: The BN edition of the GT is terrible.  I ordered the hardcover edition to have a permanent reference.  This edition has numerous typos, nearly unreadable tables, awkward physical dimensions, and Keynes' internal citations do not line up with BN's pages.  Also, for some reason the last paragraph in some chapters are a different font.  It is possible that it was an update by Keynes but no clue is given in the book.  Not even the original date of publication is given.  Avoid the BN edition if possible.

B001NLKT60|5.0|I have been anxiously awaiting the sequel and was not disappointed. This is a wonderfully written novel that kept me on my toes from start to finish. Although I suggest reading the first before this one, it does stand alone. I think some of the reasons for relationships might get lost without reading  the book. You might wonder why loyalties fall where they do.<br /><br />I haven't read a better book in quite  a long time. There is a tremendous amount of sexuality, some disturbing used to paint a vivid picture of the main character and of the theme of the novel. There are violent parts but none are graphically described. If you have see a thrilling movie recently, this shouldn't bother you. As in the first one, the author takes his time in the beginning developing a character. In this case, the main character is very unique and quite disturbed. Still, I loved her.<br /><br />I won't give away even one plot twist, there are several other reviewers who have shared that. I will say that the ending fit  story perfectly, I laughed in admiration of the author's perfect lines. He is an excellent writer. I am not sure I can wait for the final one to be translated. Wonder if Amazon has anything on how to learn Swedish. This writing might just make me do it.
