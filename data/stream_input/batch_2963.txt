B005DI994W|5.0|Pristine. Fits so very well with Zulu. I highly recommend viewers of both read Rudolph Slatin's \\"Fire and Sword in the Sudan\\" and General Gordon's Journal from Khartoum. Now that we too are finally growing tired of Empire, we can learn a lot from what the British went through and what they forced others to endure. A look at the Victoria Cross website that tracks the eventual fate of the Rourke's Drift recipients will temper any regret that you did not turn out to be a war hero. Life never was fair.

B00F35BV64|1.0|J.J. Abrams has pretty much managed to ruin the entire Star Trek universe with this release.  The characters are flat.  The actor doing Khan is terrible and horribly over acts every scene.  There is a lot of completely mindless action that really does nothing for the show.  The fifteen minutes spent flying through space, swerving around debris to get Kirk and Khan to the enemy ship is just stupid.  But worse than that, there are changes to the entire idea of Star Trek and how it was supposed to be about a better humanity that Abrams has essentially destroyed.  The future suddenly looks and feels - bleak.  And what was the thinking behind changes to the Klingons?  They look fake and just ridiculous.  Then we have plot lines which Abrams stole from the pages of Star Trek II (how we got there, chronologically, when the events of early Khan encounter haven't happened seems a stretch) - but trying to steal the emotional charge of the Spock dying scene just seemed contrived and had no impact whatsoever.<br /><br />As a Star Trek fan, I'm appalled at this latest feature.  It destroys the last vestiges of a noble Star Trek.<br /><br />As a move goer, this is just a plain stupid, flat and boring (and LONG) movie.<br /><br />Avoid like the plague!

B008JFUPK8|4.0|At 54 this movie was not even on my radar to spend money on, until I was shamed into it by my neighbors boy. I found the story to be very well done, and the special effects to be good for a movie of this type. No, or very little prior knowledge Superman is required which makes it perfect for the younger generation. By far not an award winner, but would recommend it, and spend the money on a sequel.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|Starts out interesting but later got too technical and unbelievable and hard to follow his train of thought as it got more complex.
B005S39YGU|5.0|The science these guys talk is based on input from a physics prof at UCLA, and the show's creators based the set designs on research in the haunts of actual science nerds.  The acting is brilliant, especially Jim Parsons' embodiment of a genius with dozens of personal quirks.  His roommate, Leonard, has the sweetness and emotional vulnerability that perfectly complements Sheldon's extraterrestrial weirdness, and his heartthrob Penny, played by Kelly Cuoco, is a great comedic actress, and HOT.  Her breasts add interest to any scene she's in.  As the series has moved into fifth and sixth seasons the show has expanded into new settings and situations, including a trip into space by one of the characters.  Sometimes these episodes are a bit less successful, but there are still funny moments, and the first two seasons are classics.  Chuck Lorre, the show's creator, also came up with the unwatchable TWO AND A HALF MEN.  Go figure!

B008XBCJ34|5.0|Avatar will probably always remain one of my favorite movie experiences of all time.  I will never forget the incredible thrill of first viewing it in the movie theater.  I knew, once I had purchased my first 60&#34; flat-screen 3D television, that Avatar would be my very first 3D movie purchase.  And while I still love the movie, watching the 3D version of Avatar on my television screen was not nearly as thrilling as my first experience watching it on the regular theater 2D screen.  Further, I have since owned other 3D titles that come across much more startlingly &#34;real&#34; than this copy of Avatar (Life of Pi comes immediately to mind).  That is NOT saying that this 3D version of Avatar is &#34;bad&#34;, it's just that, I guess, I was expecting more and that it didn't really deliver on that front.  Having said that, the movie itself is still a masterpiece in my book.  Avatar was--and is--simply an almost magical experience in many respects and allows the view to almost transcend and suspend belief in the often dreary day-to-day of our existence.  It allows us to cavort in that magical fairy land that is Navoo and run with and fly winged dragons with the Na'vi.  This was, for me, among the most thrilling film experiences since The Wizard of Oz (which I used to watch religiously every year as a kid) and the first Star Wars movies.  I've heard all kinds of criticisms of Avatar, from political to other types of pans, but as far as I'm concerned, these people completely miss the forest for the trees.  They do not have the ability to recognize greatness when they see it.  These are the same people who panned The Wizard of Oz when it came out.<br /><br />Avatar has been so thoroughly reviewed that I have nothing more to add to the discussion that hasn't already been said. I've stated my sole criticism and that is a minor one:  that the 3D version of this disc was not as impressive as I'd expected or hoped for.  Beyond that, the movie itself is still one of the greatest in the sci-fi/fantasy genre of all time and, as a bonus (or a curse?) are indeed powerful messages that many today would choose not to be there, &#34;interfering&#34; with their pure entertainment experience, but are nevertheless important points that need to be made.  Like it or not.  I can absolutely recommend this movie to those who enjoy a totally immersive film-going experience.est in the sci-fi/fantasy genre of all time and, as a bonus (or a curse?) are indeed powerful messages that many today would choose not to be there, &#34;interfering&#34; with their pure entertainment experience, but are nevertheless important points that need to be made.

B00F35BV64|5.0|Star Trek Into Darkness accomplished what I didn't think was possible: to re-engage, to to speak, a very respectable movie franchise to even greater heights than any of it's predecessors.  That is no small feat, but Abrams has managed it with a thoroughly engaging story and plot, and a cast of outstanding young actors.  The CG effects and everything else are, of course, first rate as well, something you would naturally expect from an Abrams film.  All of the younger actors channel their older counterparts with an amazing amount of authenticity.  It was a lot of fun watching them as they adopted the accents and mannerisms of the old guard with such skill.  Zachary Quinto's voice could have perhaps been lowered considerably to match the tonal properties of the original Spock/Nemoy, but this is just one of a few minor quibbles.  Beside,doing so would have probably come across as phony and inauthentic in any event.<br /><br />Karl Urban does a wonderful early version of the irascible Bones.  Urban is, in my opinion, a very interesting and talented young character actor who reminds me a lot of Gary Oldman or Dustin Hoffman in their ability to transform themselves so thoroughly like human chameleons). Another incredibly talented actor in this piece is Benedict Cumberbach as the evil Pike.  I first noticed Cumberbach as the modern day version of Sherlock Holmes in the unfortunately short-lived series of that same name.  He was, in my opinion, the best flim version of Sherlock Holmes I have ever seen.  FYI:  I am a HUGE Conan Doyle fan and am thoroughly acquainted with the behavior and mannerisms of Doyle's Holmes and Cumberbach managed to absolutely nail Holme's personality down in a way that no other actor has.<br /><br />Star Trek into Darkness has been thoroughly reviewed by others far more capable than myself, but I will only say that it is a must see for any serious sci-fi fan, such as myself. As I've said, it is, in my opinion, among the best, if not the best of the entire Star Trek franchise to date.  It is one that I am going to purchase on disk and watch many times.entire Star Trek franchise to date.  It is one that I am going to purchase on disk and watch many times.

B00F91RYL8|4.0|If you're looking for something completely unique by way of zombie movies, there's little to be found in World War Z that hasn't been done before other than the very intense manner in which the Zombies move like ravenous insane hyper-cockroaches.  World War Z definitely has it's moments.  There are also a few other elements of Z that make it stand out from the crowd of ubiquitous zombie movies.  Is it the ultimate zombie movie?  I'll leave that for others to decide, but I personally have to say, I don't think so.  Is it entertaining?  Absolutely.  The zombies in Z are often truly frightening in the way they move and act and charge en masse.  There are also, as is normally the case with zombie movies, huge plot holes and logical problems that go unanswered, but this is probably to be expected.  After all, who wants to watch an analytical zombie movie where everything is explained in minute detail?  Who gives a rip?  We go to zombie movies for the gore and the spectacle and the inevitable hero, which, true to form, Brad Pitt does very well.  The &#34;final solution&#34; in Z, while unique compared to other zombie movies, is also somewhat lame, but, in the end, you have to have SOME way of dealing these nasty critters.  So you must simply go with the flow.<br /><br />Having said all of these mostly positive things about it, I did find that the World of Z lacks a certain &#34;charm&#34; (if that is the appropriate word) of some of the earlier zombie films, particularly those of George Romero (with Dawn of the Dead being, perhaps, my favorite). There is little or no fun in Z here.  It is a considerably different experience here.  This is not a film you can smugly chuckle at as you watch it.  It is far too serious for that.  When all is said and done, I liked the World of Z and can recommend it to those of you who enjoy this kind of movie.  I would definitely not recommend this flick for young kids; you stand a very good chance of giving them nightmares for some some time to come. There is some pretty intense stuff in this one so if you are squeamish about such things, you might want to stay away yourself.  For the rest of you zombie fans, go see it.to come.

B008YUHQ3M|4.0|This final movie in the Harry Potter series is the darkest of all.  It is the necessary and faithful conclusion to the wonderful writings of J.K. Rowling.  There is little for me to criticize here except for one thing:  something about the ending felt somehow very disengaged and somewhat unsatisfying.  I am not quite smart enough to put my finger on exactly what that missing thing was, but I felt it.  The ending seemed almost trite and devoid of the energy of the rest of the movies.  I know it was authentic to the way that books ended, but as a movie, it seemed to need something else to bring it all to a satisfying conclusion.  Yes, I know, it all concluded the way that the book did and the outcomes were the same.  It was just the manner in which things were presented ON FILM that left me somewhat let down.  Still, given that as my only criticism, the final movie in this franchise, was yet another piece of amazing film-making.  Again, the actors were all superb.  The set pieces were absolutely done with love and care and authenticity and lavish devotion to the Rowling books.<br /><br />I've mentioned in a previous review of Part 1 that the 3D version of Hallows was way too dark to be enjoyable and that the 2D version was much better.  The same holds true for Part 2 as well.  For some reason, both 3D versions that I purchased from Amazon were way too dark and were not nearly as enjoyable of their 2D Blueray versions.  I have not taken a star away from the movie for this reason, however, but rather for the somewhat disappointing way which the final film was concluded; it just didn't seem quite right.  And yet I am at a loss to suggest a better way to handle the ending.<br /><br />I highly recommend The Deathly Hallows Part 2 and it is, in the end, a superb finish to a superb movie franchise.
B00F35BV64|5.0|Great.......I would hope to see more the same in the future.  Were the spin offs didn't do much for the Star Trek saga (i.e.;  Enterprise...next generation...etc) this takes it were it should have gone in the first place.
B008UZ7MUI|5.0|With this next to last installment of the Harry Potter series, we have the beginnings of a major, but logical, turn of events.  Deathly Hallows Part 1 leads us into that final reckoning with Voldemort that we all know has been coming, and, as such, a much darker take on that inevitability.  All previous movies have really been about the training necessary to confront the boss; mere rehearsals for the final showdown.  With these final two installments we get to the real heart of the matter and it must be darker.  No, Hallows Part 1 (and for that matter Part 2 as well) are not as much fun as the previous movies.  This one's getting much more serious, as it should. These movies are so superbly crafted and executed that they are a testament to the near reverence held for the source material by Rowling.  The directors have done an amazing job bringing Rowling's books to life in a way that truly reflects their spirit.  Needless to say it's also a testament to the wondrous descriptive writings of Rowling which enabled this to happen in the first place.<br />Also, as a movie, we watch as the character relationships between Ron and Hermione and Harry and Ginger come to fruition.  The acting by all concerned in these films has been a delight to watch.<br /><br />I have only one negative, and that has to do with the 3D version of the film:  it comes across as way too dark.  When I watch the 2D Blueray version, it looks great, but for some reason, 3D is not nearly as enjoyable because of that darkness.  I attempted to find some way to lighten it up, but couldn't figure it out.  My other 3D films, such as Avatar or Life of Pi, etc don't have this problem, so I am wondering if it was simply a case of this particular version of the Deathly Hallows that has this issue.  Part 2 has the same problem in 3D.  I will continue to investigate and see if there is any solution to this. BTW:  I have a 60&#34; LG &#34;smart&#34; 3D tv.  I have had no other issues at all with other 3D films with this set.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the whole Harry Potter experience, Deathly Hallows Part 1 is a must and is yet another very worthy work of art in that franchise.  Obviously, if you are not a fan, then there is probably little here that will compel you to seek it out.  It is part of a piece and an essential component of the whole.th this set.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the whole Harry Potter experience, Deathly Hallows Part 1 is a must and is yet another very worthy work of art in that franchise.

0545265355|3.0|The two things that bothered me most about The Hunger Games trilogy are Katniss and the over-simplicity of the Capitol's tyranny. I'll focus on Katniss and save the perfunctory tyranny for perhaps another time.<br /><br />It seems like about every third chapter throughout the series Katniss finds herself propelled through some new psychological trauma that sets her teetering on the verge of mental collapse until a new deus-ex-machina appears to allow her to pull together until the next crisis -- just the right memory at just the right time; a bon mot from Peeta; or a bombshell revelation from Haymitch that suddenly causes her to re-evaluate the nature of the universe.<br /><br />And in an effort to create a flawed and vulnerable heroine, we're subjected throughout the trilogy to Katniss's constant barrage of self-recriminations and guilt-wallowing as she pours coals on her own head for so many of the atrocities and deaths around her. But it didn't work for me. Perhaps because Katniss blamed herself once too often for some tragedy that was clearly beyond her control, I came away feeling not that here was an essentially good person who was forced to do and come to terms with despicable things, but rather someone who just didn't like herself very much. In short, Collins' attempts to create something of an anti-hero came across more forced and mechanical that they ought to have. No, that's not quite right. Almost as if her desire for a female Thomas Covenant was at war with her impulse to make Katniss more palatable to the younger audiences she's accustomed to writing for. The result was something with considerably less psychological depth and impact than Stephen Donaldson's explorations. And when Katniss does personally manage to commit a morally repugnant act -- such as the shooting of the unarmed Capitol woman -- Collins manages to back away from the full moral force of the scene by exhonerating Katniss (after all, the woman appeared as if she were about to call forhelp). (This also was one of my beefs with Rowling when the Trio begins nonchalantly tossing around the Unforgivables in DH. Why present the UCs throughout the series as so absolutely morally repugnant only to have our heroes start tossing them about so trivially in the end? Either Rowling was incapable, or afraid, of exploring the full moral implications of her heroes' actions.)<br /><br />To further this image of Katniss as a flawed heroine, we have Peeta (and, to a lesser extent, Gale) as the moral foil. Peeta, whose innate goodness is supposed to throw Katniss's moral flaws into sharp relief. The problem here is that I was never properly sold on Peeta's alleged moral qualities, and that reduced him for me from the status of moral foil to just another imagined excuse for Katniss to beat herself up with. \\"Peeta! Peeta! Peeta! Why can't I be as good as Peeta!\\" But Katniss's character judgments are called into question throughout the series, so I need more than her word on Peeta's goodness; I need to see it for myself. And I never really did. Peeta is just tossed into the story already fully formed with little character development or psychological exploration. He's just too 2D.<br /><br />This, by the way, also severely reduced the impact of Peeta's hijacking in the third book. Since I never bought into his halo in the first place, I found the ripping away of his sainthood less distressing than Collin, apparently, intended.<br /><br />And Katniss's incessant vacillations between Peeta and Gale undermined some of her psychological motivations. How could she be ready to toss Peeta aside in favor of Gale one moment, then so devoted to Peeta the next that the rebels are forced to stage a dangerous and costly rescue just to get the Mockingjay back in form? I think the triangle actually worked against the story, at least to some extent.<br /><br />I also don't think Collins fully developed the centrality of Katniss's role as the Mockingjay in the Rebellion. We were tossed a few bones -- the hospital scene in District 8, for example -- but too much of it seems to just happen offstage. Such as the single line where we're assured that just seeing a couple of Mockingjay propos has rallied the dispirited rebels so thoroughly they manage to wrest nearly every district away from the Capitol, apparently in a matter of days.<br /><br />In fact the sudden appearance of a technologically advanced District 13 itself seems almost too convenient. Something nags at me that this should bother me more than it does, but somehow it doesn't.<br /><br />On the positive side, the pacing was (with a few notable flaws; see two paragraphs up) good. The plot concept was intriguing and its execution expert enough to keep me turning pages (I finished the series in two sittings over the weekend; as I get older and less tolerant of mediocre writing, that in itself is something of a compliment). And I thoroughly enjoyed the way the Victors so thoroughly deconstructed the Games during the run-up to the Quarter Quell -- especially Peeta's bombshells during his interview. Though it did leave me scratching my head a bit at how someone as allegedly politically savvy as Snow could have not seen the danger of bringing together so many former Victors who, to put it mildly, had no love for him or the Capitol. He should have spotted that flaw in his plan a mile off. Not smart.<br /><br />Overall, three stars.

B00A6CCF0K|3.0|I pre-ordered this book eagerly. I first read the shining when I was about 10 and it scared me plenty. I have 're-read it dozens of times since and it always terrifies me. When read that Danny Torrance , protagonist of The Shining, was coming back to life, I couldn't wait.<br /><br />I read this book in under 24 hours and am left with a dissatisfied taste. The Stephen King who terrified me is gone. This novel offers less information than a Facebook page. The plot is tepid, characters 2 dimensional, scare factor 0.<br /><br />I read New Stephen King out of nostalgia- if I want a good scare- I dig out his old stuff.
B00119ZMKW|5.0|Following Season 5, Michael Shanks (Dr. Daniel Jackson) left the show and was briefly replaced by Corin Nemec (Jonas Quinn) before his eventual return in Season 7. This makes Season 6 stand out as sort of an odd duck. Lots of fans initially didn't want to like the character of Quinn because he was replacing fan-favorite Jackson, and by the time the character (and his actor) began to come into his own among the cast, the producers had secured Michael Shanks' triumphant return. Jonas Quinn was subsequently written off the show, with barely any send-off whatsoever.<br /><br />Hindsight has been more favorable to Jonas Quinn. The character was interesting, well-written, and well-acted. He was distinct enough from Jackson that it doesn't feel like the producers are trying to clone him, though he still filled the same crucial role in the show's core group of characters. It's a shame the producers couldn't keep Quinn AND Jackson on board after Season 6, because the character (and the actor) deserved better.
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|The Conjuring is an incredibly refreshing film. It has been a long time since I've seen a horror movie that was effective, scary, and all around a good film. Most studios pump out low budget horror with bad acting because they know that teenagers will see whatever comes out, this movie is not only a great horror movie, but a fine film. Years down the road we'll be putting The Conjuring in conversation with The Exorcist, Halloween, Rosemary's Baby, and The Shining.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This book is proof positive that, while war is hell, it is nevertheless possible to find a few good men on both sides of a bad conflict. Many of the pilots of the Luftwaffe in the Second World War were known for their chivalry, and Franz Stigler was no exception. This was a very interesting story to read--and I particularly enjoyed the telling of this tale from the two different perspectives; the Austrian Franz Stiglers, and the American Charlie Browns. Franz Stigler is at once a hero to Americans and Britons alike because, when confronted with an astonishingly easy opportunity to down an isolated American bomber over Germany , Stigler instead decided to allow the badly damaged bomber and crew to limp back to the safety of their base in England. While flying alongside the tattered bomber, Stigler immediately noticed one member of their crew was dead, the bomber was torn to shreds, and her crew visibly shaken. He could read their suffering in their facial expressions from the vantage point of his cockpit. Maybe he had some form of an epiphany? The highly capable Luftwaffe ace didnt fire upon the bomber, which would certainly have sent it plummeting far below them into the Atlantic Ocean killing everyone aboard. This must not have been an easy decision for him to make, and it is not difficult to see how this act of merciful restraint might be construed as a traitorous dereliction of duty by his German countrymen. In fact it was-- yet fortunately for Stigler no German witnesses on the ground reported the strange spectacle to the authorities or it might have meant the firing squad for him. Charlie Brown and the rest of the American bomber crew somehow managed to keep flying and made it back to their base in England. The American crew survived their ordeal and, after the war, managed to find wives, have children, their children had children, and so forth... Thus, Franz Stiglers single action had a ripple effect forward through time. Quite a few children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren of the bomber crew owe their very existence to this Luftwaffe ace.  What if the tables were turned and this were a novel about an American P-51 Mustang pilot who chivalrously allowed a badly damaged German bomber and her crew to limp back home to Germany? Would we all have the same amout of veneration for HIM as we do for Franz Stigler? I certainly know that I would, and this is why I loved this book more than I expected. It provided MUCH food for thought. Read this book and you will not be disappointed.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I LOVE this app. It is so entertaining trying too keep theses people alive, they are so funny to watch in the video. Parents be warned it can be a little much for younger kids.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I put this book right up there with Laura Hildebrand's &#34;Unbroken&#34;.  It shows the air war from both sides and how one good measure has major repercussions.  The ending will leave you teary eyed.  One of the best war books written.
B005PK57IK|5.0|So well written for each character. The actors mix well and the drama in which they create or react to in many of te situations. Love the judges roles and how each one has such quirks in the way they run their court room. Very intriguing.

B005HEFB6M|5.0|I love Star Trek Enterprise because it provides likable characters and the adventures of the first Enterprise crew are entertaining. I wish Enterprise had stayed on the air longer. The &#34;roughing it&#34; experience is what is most enjoyable and the characters must really count on each other in order to survive the unknown.
B0093LINVK|5.0|I chose 5 stars because the NUC is the absolute best device at what it does. It is not a shy performer, it hits hard and knows how to perform and when to perform. I'm using it as a HTPC for my home with XBMC and it works perfectly for movies, music, and tv shows.

B009NLC1D6|2.0|Very poor audio quality/level. It would randomly increase or decrease the level of the sound. I had to blast the TV to hear it .
B00EMJD6TC|5.0|I first saw this movie at the advance screening in Atlanta, Georgia (I wish I could insert my pictures of Brad Pitt!!) and went into the theater waiting to be disappointed.  I am one of those people who love the book, purchased the audiobooks (both the first abridged version and the one that was supposed to be unabridged but wasn't) and watches/reads all things zombie related.  I knew the movie was not going to follow the survivor stories outlined in the book and I was sure the movie was going to be the let down of my summer.<br /><br />Instead the movie was extremely intense, wonderfully paced, and contained a few little details from the book (not much but I wasn't expecting any similarities at all), and a very pleasant surprised.  I bought the unrated version as a birthday gift to myself and fell in love the movie all over again.<br /><br />This is a VERY solid zombie film that covers the degeneration of society as everyone scrambles to save themselves and shows governments making tough decisions in order to try and keep some type of hope alive.  Yes, Brad Pitt's character piecing together everything from a few casual observations did tempt me to roll my eyes a couple of times BUT it was still a great movie.<br /><br />I would have enjoyed a few more battles and more blood and guts (like the reported original ending would have included) but it was still a great movie and I hope there is a sequel.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I read this less than a month after reading its predecessor. I loved both, but this book might be my favorite. I loved the characters, especially Dan Torrance as an adult. This book had its moments of horror, but moments of depth and beauty as well. I prefer my horror with a heavy dose of humanity. Understanding just what could be lost makes the fear more palpable.  Hard to put down!
B0064MPXFA|4.0|I love this series. It combines mystery with legal kind of like Law and Order but not so intense. Works good at bedtime because it's not quite so disturbing.

B0034G4P8A|3.0|This review will be mostly regarding this version rather than the movie . I give the movie five stars. It's one of my favorites.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the copy you can load digitally is the movie only, and is on one disc, while all of the extras, including the deleted scenes, are on the second Blu-ray Disc. I thus cannot load any of the extras onto my computer, iPad, iTunes,etc. which I find pretty annoying. This is why this version I'd getting three stars instead of five.
B00AQCMK32|4.0|Most tablet or smartphone games are meant to just be picked up and played for a few minutes while you're bored or waiting for something to happen. Usually I'm not one to spend money on an android game either, mostly opting out  for the free versions. Games by Kairosoft however are different. After deciding to take the plunge and paying the $2.50 I was greatly pleased with my decision. The first night I bought the game I could not put it down. The mix of sim style play and RPGesque elements made the game engaging and challenging to achieve what you want with your company. The allusions to real life companies, games, people and systems made me chuckle and smile every time I would recognize one. I would recommend Game Dev Story and every other title from Kairosoft if your looking for an absorbing game experience that can be as simplistic as pick up and play for a minute or as deep as delving into a RPG classic for hours.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I was three chapters into this book before I decided to finish it.  I wanted to diagram the character relationships to make sure I had everything right.  Suddenly, everything snaps into place.  Your too tightly wired Tupperware lady gets a little nutty; the school secretary suddenly develops a murderous rage for the PE teacher.  Marriages hit some rough spots; characters make stupid decisions.  Kids bounce back.  And then you pause to consider if a 40 year old mistake hadn't happened.  I found myself, going &#34;Oh, this is nuts!&#34; and unable to put the book down.

B00000099Y|4.0|one of Tool's best, has a lot of their best songs. If you like Tool, its definitely a must have.
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|This game and the video are really funny, the only issue are the ads.  There is no reason to launch a video ad after every time you lose.  The ads almost make me not want to play the game, but its too hilarious.  Get it, its a great laugh.  Make sure to watch the video, leave it to the Aussies to make a hilarious service announcement.
B00D8HNR2K|4.0|Awesome that they produced a new album. Thought Reznor was all done and on to other things. This album feels different from his other work. Some hopeful songs, really far from where it all began. Classic fans may not find it what they were expecting.
B005JE7WKI|5.0|I LOVED this movie!!  I typically don't like violent movies but this one isn't as gory as you would think. It is hilarious ..my favorite line.. \\"Hey, college kids! We've got your friend!\\"

B009JZSC9S|5.0|There is never a dull moment in this story line. It's punctuated with humor, twists and turns. How about more stuff like it?
B00FFVLYTU|4.0|I wanted to watch the entire series before reviewing it. What I came away with was not that this was a particularly caring village shaken by the murder of a young boy, or a study of the effect of that death upon various members of the community--though there is that, but a village in which almost everyone, including children, harbors their own secrets, which are unknown even to those closest to them. As the police investigation unfolds, and the villagers fall under suspicion, long buried secrets, and present ones, are revealed much to the shock of the the community and loved ones, who never suspected anything was amiss. And so, the essential unknowabilty of others, and of their motivations or why they chose to act on their destructive desires becomes the fascinating glue which holds this story together.<br /><br />Though I long guessed the identity of the perpetrator, the intimacy, vulnerability, rage and shame exhibited by the characters in the final episode was so well done and so very shocking that I actually had nightmares afterward.<br /><br />Very good script, and wonderful acting particularly from Olivia Colman who plays the kind and sensitive policewoman Ellie Miller. Recommended.
B00F56AZK4|3.0|good game but it wants you to buy more puzzles. Puzzles seem small and fairly easy to complete. kills time
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Excellent gaming. Great value with screenshots, soundtrack and more. Games are excellent. Journey and Flower are mesmerizing. PS Plus is great
B0029LCJJS|4.0|This entire show captivated me; mystery, intrigue, romance, sex, and outstanding costumes and history! I learned a lot about historical events and was especially engaged in learning about how/why the Catholics and Protestants split from one another. The reign of Henry the 8th was tyrannical and the viewer needs to be prepared for some brutal scenes. I highly recommend this series, particularly to fans of historical fiction.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Omg this is the best game in the world if you got grounded from your laptop this will help if your are a minecraft fan
B006U1LYP8|4.0|When I first began listening to the audiobook, it seemed more like a children's book than a serious historical novel. The narrator's voice sounded like an English primary school teacher. She recited archeological and geological data and then told a simple story about a family of hunter-gatherers. I was prepared to delete the audio and go back to listening to music during workouts and road trips, but I hung in. The more I listened the more engaging the book became. As the way of life portrayed became more complex and interesting, as history moved forward, the narrator's voice and the stories of the inhabitants of the Sarum area became more sophisticated.<br /><br />The author's conceit is to follow families through the millennia to tell the story of Sarum. Rutherford provides what is known of the historical, geological, and archeological facts at the beginning of each chapter, which cover chronological epochs of history for southeast England. The 1033 page book is a magnum opus, because it provides the reader with nuggets of the entire known history of the Salisbury area and rewards the reader with truly engaging stories, i.e., historical fiction at its best.<br /><br />The one disappointment is that Rutherford's action scenes are usually pretty lame and tame. He has not mastered the art of combat in fictional narrative. He is a master of plot and character, and a fine pop historian.<br />[[ASIN:B00B0Q71A0 Pilgrimage: Sturgis to Wounded Knee and Back Home Again, a Memoir]]
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I loved this series and wish that we could have more quality TV programs just like it, instead of the fluff pieces that darken our screens so often, and are downright boring.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|This book was an interesting change from what I consider to be the usual Sanderson. Now,it's hard to describe his books as 'usual' as each world he imagines is unique. However, this is the first time I think he has done a story in an almost contemporary timeline. Being a fan of superheroes, the anti-hero concept has also fascinated me. There is the classic Spiderman line of &#34;With Great Power, Comes Great Responsibility&#34; , but in a more realistic world the phrase that is more apt is that &#34;Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.&#34; This book is more reflective of the latter phrase.<br />All in all, well written and imagined as always with a good plot twist. Although there were some things that I picked up before they were revealed, I was taken by surprise a few times and I did get Steelheart's weakness wrong. Although I think I came close. As always, a good buy. I have learned to appreciate a good stand alone story in  world of endless trilogies and ten book series.<br />As an avid reader of Sci-Fi and Fantasy novels my favorite phrase is &#34;You can't go wrong with Sanderson&#34; and that is true of this book.

B00F8H0LM2|5.0|We found this version challenging (a super thing).  Getting that third star is not a push over.  Get it.and enjoy.
B00DBSZEH2|4.0|It may be a little hoaky but my husband and i really enjoyed it.  We are in our early sixties and love sci-fi/fantasy.  This movie is strictly for entertainment and it delivers.  Besides Jeremy Renner is a good actor and not bad to look at either.  Not for kids younger than 14 because it is a little scary and because of story content.  Older teens should enjoy it.  Obviously, it is nothing like the storybook story we grew up with.<br /><br />Watch and enjoy!
B001XUJMZK|5.0|Like The Patriot, Gibson makes a case for continuing the fight for freedom and liberty.  People have died for this over the centuries and modern Americans should not take these for granted.  The battle scenes are among the best ever made.  The views of the highlands are wonderful.

I have used it at work with a lot of success but it takes a while for upper management to want to receive information this way. More importantly I have been using it to feel more capable of teaching my son when we have a minute or two in a restaurant or on the couch in the morning.
B00AZMFJYA|3.0|This DVD release is pathetic.  All it has is the movie itself with closed captions and subtitles along with movie trailers of other Paramount Pictures movies.  There are no bonus features like commentaries, documentaries, or the movie trailer itself.  Nice going Paramount.

B00F8H0LM2|4.0|Lots of fun just like the original version with the Star Wars touch. It also has an extra treat, &#34;ANGRY BIRDS&#34; TOONS.<br />FUN!
B008NA3I30|3.0|This review contains spoilers...!<br /><br />I found this film appealing in some ways but confusing in others.  I kept wondering what Sarah Polley was trying to do and then, the next day I remembered her autobiographical film, \\"Stories We Tell\\" which seems to me to explain the murky parts in this one.<br /><br />In \\"Stories We Tell\\" which came out the year after this, Polley reveals that the man she thought was her real father was  not, that her mother had had an extended affair with another man who was Sarah's biological father. Sarah's mother as played in that film, as well as actual footage of her, bears a strong resemblance to Michelle Williams's character.  They are both young, beautiful, blond, vivacious and sexy.  They are both artistically inclined but frustrated.  Sarah's mother was a sometimes actress and Michelle's character is a sort-of writer.  Both leave their safe, loving, respectable husbands for artist types, one a painter and one a film maker.  In Sarah Polley's mother's case she did return to the family but died soon afterward.  I had to wonder how much of this film was an attempt on the part of Sarah to make sense to herself of her own mother's behavior.  She succeeds beautifully in \\"Stories We Tell\\" but in this film, it doesn't quite work.<br /><br />The supposed moral of this film, is \\"the grass is always greener...\\" Or as the alcoholic sister-in-law puts it, that there is always something missing and one just has to find ways to deal with that hole.  Here the Michelle Williams character leaves her dull but dutiful husband for a more exciting one, but in the end it seems that happiness once again has eluded her and she seem to find her happiness by herself as shown in the last scene, where she rides alone on the amusement park ride.<br /><br />The idea that one can't look to another to fill up the empty hole inside is a valid one. The problem here is that the film doesn't really show that the second relationship is all that bad.  It seems likethe characters Sarah Polley wrote took off with their own lives and left her intention in the dust.  Their romance in gorgeous and hot and totally believable.  Who wouldn't leave the poor chubby chicken-cooking hubby for the sexy, exciting, and NICE, painter (and rickshaw driver!)  Her hubby's idea of sexual foreplay is to talk baby talk, while the other guy practically sends her into orbit at their conversation over Martinis.  That and the underwater scene in the pool were the two highlights of the film, in my opinion, with the waltz to the Leonard Coehn song, a close third.  I'd almost buy the film for those scenes.<br /><br />So it was not all believable to me that suddenly this very beautiful romance is shown to be have turned sour.  The threesomes in bed seemed totally out of character.  This guy wasn't a cheap sleaze out for kicks and I don't think she was either.  A more realistic development to me would be that they'd have the children that she wanted and which her husband avoided having.<br /><br />It seems to me that the Sarah couldn't let her characters get away with their actions  and have a happy life together, that she had to make them wrong somehow.  Boo!  I saw the film more as a coming of age film for the female character.  She married the nice, safe, secure Daddy guy and they talked baby talk to each other in bed and played other silly games  At one point when  she outgrows that and asks him to do lose the baby talk he pouts and goes back to frying his chicken.  No wonder she was ready for the next stage in her development---a real, adult sexy guy who would definitely deliver.  I just think that Polley copped out by showing that romance as a symptom of the woman's weakness.  The film itself, belies that message.  I found the ending scene with Michelle alone in the amusement park ride not at all convincing, a failed attempt to make a point that she was forcing on her characters.
B00EDDUKGY|5.0|This movie is so great! I went into it with no real knowledge of what it was about and I truly didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did. It left me feeling so uplifted and just happy. Since my first watching I've re-watched it at least 4 times and it doesn't lose any appeal. My niece, who is 2, loves this film. Any kid would enjoy it, I believe. I'm 20 and I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Nice movie and great graphics. love to see all marvel heros in one movie and fighting for a common cause
B003V1WUKS|5.0|Books like Palo Alto roll around once in a lifetime. Franco captures the essence of what it means to grow up (or not to grow up, in some cases) with ease. Beautifully written, heartbreaking and funny, startling, warm, uplifting and thought provoking - to sum it up in one word, profound. A must read.
B00190N4E4|5.0|this was a movie well done. very informative about the life of a man that changed the world with original thought and self motovation. it is educationl entertaining and inspiring.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|Love the new version. Being able to go over to the &#34;pork&#34; side adds a whole different level. Buy it, you wont put it down!!!
B005PK57IK|5.0|Excellent writing, a cast of extremely talented professionals capable of perfect performances that continually define their characters with new information for us. Transparent directing. Top level production values. Some very timely, interesting and informative story lines that do not always please you with their outcomes and thus seem the more real for it.  This is great TV.
B00F91SCXC|2.0|This is a very disappointing rendition of the novel.<br /><br />It is one of the worst films in the Zombie genre.
B0031RS7X6|5.0|This was a very entertaining read.  The main character is so funny, an absolute verbal klutz. But of course true love wins through in the end.
B008D28HYS|4.0|I downloaded this game as the FAOTD - but I definitely would not have paid the regular asking price.<br /><br />It's the third game of this type I've tried. The first was PiCranium Picross, which I liked a lot -- the only thing was that I got frustrated when I was unable to finish a puzzle and there was no way to find out what I had done wrong. I tried another similar game - Griddlers Plus - which is okay, too.<br /><br />For those unfamiliar with nonograms, it's a wordless crossword puzzle where you fill squares with puzzles to form a picture based on clues for each row and column. Squares end up either filled or blank. You use an X to indicate to yourself that logic indicates you cannot fill the square.<br /><br />From other reviews, I thought this one would be better. It definitely provides more help than PiCranium Picross but there are things about the interface I don't like.<br /><br />First, I find the colors are rather ugly. I'll probably prefer the monochrome version but am not going to pay $5 to get it.<br />But the main problem I have is the input method. To color a square, you choose the color and then tap once. A second tap places an X and the third tap removes it altogether. To fill a row or column, you tap, hold down, and drag. The problem is, each time you tap a new square, it fills it with the color. You have to tap twice for the X, and three times for the blank. So, to fill a row with an X, you have to tap the square, then tap again, hold, and drag. Or, you have to tap twice on each blank square.<br /><br />Since your stylus or finger is on the square, you don't know what mode you are in when you're tapping or dragging. It's too easy to make a mistake.<br /><br />I think it would be a big improvement if there were a separate button for the X. When a color button is selected, tapping a new square once would color it, and the second time would just erase the color, without putting the X. Tapping a colored square would also erase it. To place an X should be a separate button.ld be a separate button.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Really enjoy this game not to bad for free. The graphics are good love the options with weapons and armour.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Glad to see Tennant's return to TV - we were hooked from the first episode! Great show - hope it returns.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Best book I've read in a long time. The writing was done so well. You really can't explain the book without giving it away so dont think about reading it, just do it!!
B0081336FO|4.0|In general, I loved Sherlock, but this season contained my favorite episode (Scandal in Belgravia) and my least favorite (Hounds of Baskerville).  The season ender was good, but of course frustrating since the cliff-hanger is still unresolved.
B0007939NO|5.0|family member enjoyed this movie. work well. could watch it over and over. have lent to other people. would recommend this movie to anyone
B00499NHLC|5.0|I tried watching one of the Sherlock episodes on Mystery - not even sure which one it was, but I was less than impressed.  However, friends kept insisting that I would love the series so I tried downloading from Amazon Prime.  I didn't really get hooked until I had watched season 1 once then gone back to watch the second time and suddenly realized all the nods to the Sherlock Holmes stories, the growing relationship between Sherlock and John, and even Sherlock's sort of mellowing.  It's nice to  see a well written series where characters can change and not get stereotyped as themselves.  I bought the DVDs so I could see the original pilot (which was interesting - I thought the mystery was solved better than in the aired episode) and the commentary, which I have to say I was a little disappointed in.  There were a couple of participants I just could not hear well enough to understand.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|Better than Stargate SG-1! Hard to beat that... Great story, great actors and great set. What more can I say
B00F91H666|5.0|The movie was great. Watched with my son and we commented often about what a good job they did. I wont spoil it, and to be blunt we only had an issue with 1 scene. Acting, plot, zombies et al where very realistic and well thought out. I must add that I know nothing of the book. My son did and did not mind this adaptation at all. So go ahead and watch it if your a zombie, sci-fi, end of the world kinda fan. Last comment, almost every time we'd say \\"you know this would be great if\\", they beat us to the punch and had it there. Hope you enjoy - Don't recall any gratuitous scenes or some of the more questionable concerns. Not for young kids!!! BTW we rented the uncut version.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|Good book but it felt a. It unfinished for me at the end. Kept me interested the whole way through
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I love how you get to see both sides of the manor house.  You're involved with both the servants, and the owners.  It can be funny, and it can be very sad, but you really grow to love (and hate!) the characters.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|Loved the book. I will be reading all her other books :)<br />Loved her style of writing would really recommend
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|Really great app,  helps learn the languages easily and quickly. Some of the words in languages I am not used to ate hard to pronounce,  but it works with you. Really fantastic app!
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Don't know what the fuss is about. Boring book. Didn't like the style of writing. Seemed amateur. Wouldn't recommend to others
B001P06GX4|5.0|My kids are tweens and this game is fantastic for us all to play together.<br /><br />It is mind challenging and we set up different house rules sometimes to make it either harder or easier, there is so many varriations you can play.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I was approximately a third of the way through the book before before it became a &#34;can't put it down&#34; type of book.  After that my curiosity was stimulated to the point that it became difficult to leave it and when I had to I couldn't wait to get back into it.  Overall I would highly recommend it to my friends and neighbors.  I've read most of John Grisham's books and I would rate this one among one of his better books he's written but not necessarily his best.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Fabulous film. So glad a new Trek era has begun. I know some hardcore Trekers are upset about this alternate timeline but it opens up so much space (pun intended!) for new stories!! Let it go, guys, and be glad the series goes forth and prospers.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I love this game it's entertaining and it's the first game I ever rate it was so amazing I just had to rate it 5 stars \(^_^)/
B00004CXYQ|4.0|A great movie made even better by being a true story.  Geoffrey Rush is a great actor and excels in his role in this movie.
B00F35B8F8|5.0|Love it!  Among the the first and second movies, I rank this higher than the first!  If you're a trekkie, you must have this one in your collection
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Read to chapter 8.  Implausible story line coupled with the pornographic nature and just downright terrible writing was just more than I could stand.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|The President's Club is a wonderful read. The fascinating accounts of Presidents and former Presidents sheds a new perspective on history. The book is also encouraging as we see political differences giving way to true statesmanship and cooperation. It was heartwarming to see that maybe we aren't nearly as divided as a country as we are led to believe.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I am stuck. I have done everything I can think of. Not fun if you can't keep going. I liked it up til then.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is a must read, I can't wait to read it with my middle school students. The message or theme of kindness in this novel is inspiring.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this one. I have played many. I like the slots and the different countries format. I do think it is a little pricey. Love the voices too.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Growing up, putting puzzles together was a family thing.  We would put the puzzle on the coffee table and begin by putting the boarder together, even the little ones would help with that.  Then, on our way through the house, we would stop and see if we could put in a piece or two, then go on with what we were doing.<br />If we had a little time to kill, we would sit on the couch and sort out some pieces by color and work in as much as we could.<br />With magic puzzle you have many puzzles to choose from.  After choosing the puzzle, you have the ability to make it easy, for the younger ones or harder for the more experienced.  You can also make the pieces spin or not.  Spinning makes it more like the real thing, not only deciding where it goes but whether it's upside down or sideways.<br />Then, just when you have solved them all, you can choose a new topic-pack to add all with the same choices easy, hard or rotating or not.  Giving you and your family and friends hours of puzzle fun.
B005DJREGQ|4.0|funny, cute, quirky...i would definiteky recommend this show to anyone in love with thw human condition. specifucally, that of a 15-year-old girl.

B005GRTNXC|5.0|i love leona lewis..her music is the best and she's one of my favorite artist ever..i just wanted to say that i recently purchased this cd directly from amazon..i got it yesterday.UPS brung my item.anyways when i opened the package,the cd was open.it wasn't wrapped like a cd was suppose to be when buying it..it looked used..the case was cracked..the whole case was damaged..i was very angry.i hope next time this does not happen again..i love amazon,so ill let this slide
B005IQZB14|4.0|As a fan of Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance,I began to draw comparisons as soon as I started reading this book. It is like a female Robert without all the definitions of quality and a little heroin thrown in as well.<br /><br />I greatly appreciated the honesty and the reality at the heart of this book. There is so much to who we are that our children, and our parents, never know. Let alone understand.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I enjoy playing this game for hours at a time. It is exciting to see whom you have passed with a high score. Playing with my Facebook friends is wonderful. I would recommend this game to any one.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|this has you guessing through parts of movie, ending was  lack luster , but still a good summer movie for kids and family
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Excellent entertainment.  We all enjoyed it and became hooked on the series. Can not wait for the next one, although iron man 3 was a bit of a let down.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|this movie could have been so much more had they spent more time developing the characters with in the move. very sad  it didn't draw you into the race to find the fix
B0064MGU98|4.0|There are season/series-long story arcs in The Good Wife, but I watch it because its episodic, case-of-the-week stories are so strong. It reminds me of the early seasons of House in that respect.
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|very good time . as before they have pull off a grey sequel for a summer ride. just wish more of the of the cut s shown after would have been left in. ending was awesome
B004LP3AYI|4.0|It.s nice to have a fantasy story that also has some adult themes along with a rousing good adventure stores
B00881VLCE|5.0|This electronic version of piecing together a puzzle is a great alternative to taking up your dining room table with a puzzle in progress for weeks. It also provides a great selection of free puzzles to add to your collection.
B00BMNM4H6|4.0|Great game that forces you to think ahead, good logical thinking skills for people of all ages. I would recommend!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Fun but too kind of slow in between games. I also need more tutorials on the power up. The graphics are really good, fine and really cute.
B00F91H15W|2.0|Ok. , just ok , I should have waited for HbO .  I thought the storyline could have been listed out better.
B0066W1AZK|1.0|this app is very glitchy. 5 moves into the game it automatically sent me back to the main menu. also the undo button could determine the game. it's definetly not a good chess app.
B007EECSFA|4.0|I gave this book 4 stars because it was good.  However, I think there could have been a lot of \\"fluff\\" cut out of it.  It took me a good 100 pages before I could really get into it.  Then it was really good except there was just way too much of each persons life being brought out.  It kept my interest after the first 100 pages and the ending was a surprise.  I did not see that coming at all.  I would recommend the book but with the warning that it does drone on a bit.  I have never read anything by this author before but I would entertain looking into it.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I was not sure I liked the idea of a Shining sequel, because the original was very personally meaningful for me.<br />But, in the same way King long ago elevated the horror novel he has raised the bar on what a sequel can be. This book means maybe even more to me than the Shining, and I suspect it will for many others. I don't know what critics will think, but if you are one of Kings &#34;constant readers&#34;, you're in for a thrill and I envy you that the ride is still ahead of you!
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|Love Iron Man! Attention keeping throughout! A must see! I can't wait for the Avengers 2. Marvel movies are ingenious.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|this game is the ish lol hate that uploading to face book is a mission cause I don't have one nor do I want one but oh well...BADASS GAME
B008U3NU38|5.0|I had no problems downloading these discs to my iTunes at all!  With all the extras you get this set is FIVE stars easily.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was so good I literally read it in 24 hours. I laughed, I cried, I aww'ed. This is by far one of my favorite books
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It works and that is better than what i had so i'm very pleased.  charges very quickly and oh so efficently
B004YXE438|5.0|I usually don't do puzzles, however this is really fun. I like u have to use your brains on the difficult puzzles. Good variety of puzzles.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|After each episode I could not wait for the next one. Really loved these videos. Thanks for making them available.
B00CTMA95S|5.0|Contemporary storyline (comet ISON), the usual gripping historical facts mixed with exciting fiction and blended with the most significant scientific progress of modern times in terms of Higgs-Boson & dark energy.<br /><br />10 recommendation!
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|It was an easy ready, but a bit too trite for my preferences. Would be good for a beach read.
B00631VJIC|5.0|I bought both #1 and #2 I sure hope they turn out more CDs of the next two seasons before  much longer!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Oh what a wonderful writer.  The stories are poignant and and gentle even though their scope is global and sad. I was hooked from the first page and had a week of before-bed reading to look forward to.  I will go back and read his second book, as I missed it.
B005HEFB6M|4.0|Season 1 was a great introduction to the beginning of the starship Enterprise story.  Majority of the episodes were good or better.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|And This is great I really like it I think this is for 12 and under (GREAT) and it is free
B005AVIZ6U|5.0|Jack Reacher wins again. Another story another problem to solve another girl<br />Like these books as they are an easy read that don't give you nightmares
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Just like the old days. I loved Abra and Azreel and am glad the cat was not killed in the book. Why authors have to abuse animals, especially cats in writing makes me sick. I did enjoy this book. Now you can call me names.
B0089LOG02|4.0|This is a well written story of tragedy and survival.  It may tie things up in too sweet a bow in the end but sometimes that is kind of nice.
B005HJWWW8|4.0|Let me 1st say that this review is strictly for people new to audiophil stuff (what ever that means!? ha!) So judge my review on that note!<br /><br />I am new to the music world of electronics, I am a college kid who needs good music to study and relax.<br />I am a person who wants the best for the most economical price possible!  Here comes the filo e6 to fill that need=]<br /><br />1st I have a sennhiesser 598HD I read reviews that such an expensive headphone required 2 things, 1) High quality music ie. 320Bit, and 2) AN AMP!<br /><br />Why an amp? why a filo? well, you can only answer this question if you have heard the power of an amp on a high quality headphone.<br /><br />1st let me say straight out that using this amp improved ALL my music 100%, you can tell the difference! How can I compare it too? Easy, go to pandora click on audio preview of normal quality and \\"high quality\\" (196bit psh what a joke!) Well anyways when you hear those two you can hear and feel the difference regardless of headphone/earbud.<br />This is how I compare having earphones with the filo e6, I feel a surge of sounds I couldn't detect previously.<br /><br />For the price of 20bucks, such an improvement was worth it, the battery lasts me 6+ hours I always charge it after usage but it should go for 10 hours on 1 charge.<br /><br />I wont talk about the settings because I am not an expert on what it means, but basically dumbed down it means 1) louder, 2) smooth loud, 3) softened up (take this with grain of salt)<br /><br />I give it 4 stars and not 5 because I have NOTHING to compare it too, therfor I will NOT give it the benifit of doubt that its the best.<br />I will say that 4 stars is premium and that this is a great gadget to have for STARTERS like myself into this audiophil world=]<br /><br />I hope this review was helpful!!! (Y)
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Love this game<br /><br />It is the best game I have ever played<br /><br />If you don't got this game you have not lived lol
B00E0SX118|5.0|my kids loved it it kept them glued twice in a row and finally things were quiet. me and my wife also loved it.
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|Performing in plain sight, a troupe of magicians loot banks and accounts. The means and motive provide a platform for a very good movie but the script and acting blow the opportunity. One could believe that the performers are as clever and resourceful as they are drawn. However, for this to work, their pursuers would need to be worthy opponents. Instead, the various authorities are portrayed as universally obtuse dolts, which isn't credible. However, the movie does provide some entertaining scenes and can suffice when nothing else is readily available for viewing.
B008476HBM|4.0|The story is interesting. Though it is better to read slow. The language is not straightforward. Not flowering, but maybe I can say too &#34;elaborate&#34;. Though that is not the right words either. Anyway, it's the language at that time.
B004ADF7RO|2.0|I tried twice to watch this and just couldn't get past the beginning. Not sure if I will try again.
159463176X|5.0|After reading A Thousand Splendid Suns, I thought I would never again find a book so moving that I would remember for years after.  Well, Hosseini has done it again with And The Mountains Echoed.  If you're looking for a book that will stick with you, something that will be a worthy read, this is definitely the book for you!
B00CG5MVD6|4.0|I am a big Johnny Depp fan and I loved this movie.  I have actually watched it twice. A quirky love story that plays on the premise there is someone for everyone.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|The Good Wife never fails. The writing is intelligent, the pace is perfect and the cast is fantastic! This season Amanda Peet, Nathan Lane have joined the cast in guest roles. They are both favorites of mine. I am impressed, particularly, by Lane's role. He is very buttoned down and restrained. I am accustomed to his over the top performances. Lane's nuanced role here is poignant. Amanda Peet is always exciting to watch too.<br />Carrie Preston and Michael J. Fox return in their recurring roles.I want to BE Elsbeth Tacioni, she is so much fun to watch. Michael J Fox is a crackp up with his sleaziness.<br />The stories are captivating and have that thread that weaves them together yet stand alone if one has not watched for awhile.<br />Keep it up TGW! Keep setting the bar higher still for everyone else.
B005PK57IK|5.0|This is a great show! I'll just leave it at that. I would give many more reviews if Amazon streamlined this process and didn't require so much writing.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King blows me away once again!! I read my first SK novel when I was 13 years old, curled up in my bed with my parents thinking I was doing my homework. Just feasting on every page of Firestarter, Salems Lot, It or whatever I could get my hands on.  This novel did the same thing for me.  I could not put it down, and yet so sad knowing that I would be done with this incredible read so soon.<br />The relationship between Danny and Abra is amazing and you can just feel the connection between the two and the need that Abra has to connect with him.  How wicked and depraved the True Knot group is, and yet you have to wonder at the family like connection of the True Knot group within it's members.<br />It is a great read, and once again my hat is off to SK for giving me a couple of days of shivers, tears and thoughts that provoke my emotions!
B009JZSC9S|5.0|My wife and I (in our late 50's) have enjoyed this show a great deal.  The interplay between the sleazy hypocrisy of high-priced law practice and the occasional client-centered genuine advocacy has been fun to watch.  We enjoy the guest stars, who are often cast against type, such as Nathan Lane as a stiff accountant type.  I find the writing excellent.  I'm looking forward to season 5
B009JZSC9S|5.0|This series is so addicting - can't stop watching it. I love the intrigue, smart humor and character development! keep going....
1476727651|5.0|I loved this book...<br /><br />This book brought together all the things I loved about The Shining and Salem's Lot.<br /><br />King is still the best!!!
B00C1XZ2LQ|5.0|Epic and haunting. I heard it for the first time in the movie, and just loved all of it, which is sometimes hard to do when there is usually only one or two I like and the rest are just filler.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Absolutely loved it. The storyline is great and the continuation of the main story along with other smaller stories (of lawsuits) is fantastic.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Downton Abbey is the absolute best thing on TV! The show is gripping drama that maintains a wholesomeness about it without sacrificing content.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Really enjoyed this book. Good writing, good story lines. Would recommend it to anyone who enjoys zombies or a good quick book.
B00DW39B2K|3.0|3 1/2 stars. Worth watching. Some scenes make you cringe. De Niro makes any film good. Travolta plays a completely different type of character.
B005544TRQ|5.0|While this show misrepresents the practice of law in many respects (no one at a firm that size practices in so many areas, no single firm only hires from one school, no firm of any size EVER completely fails to vet potential hires), the characters, dialogue and plot twists make for entertaining viewing.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|I really enjoy this book and i feel much better I think everyone must read it!!! And do it too!!!
B001R60ESE|5.0|What an incredible concert, well recorded and beautifully done. I was never a fan of trumpet before this recording. Botti has made me a fan!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome. It's free and it's for all ages you should really try it. It's really fun. Try it!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|He is so look adorable!!! I wish I could have him as a pet!!! Of course the game is just as awesome as the other two!
B004RZGUBM|5.0|Charles Dickens is a marvelous writer. With this collection I can search for the stories I like and reread them. His characters are some of the most memorable in literature.  His writing inspires me to be a better and more entertaining writer of stories.
B00DK9FNLY|1.0|Table Tennis 3D seems less designed to entertain you than it is to feed you to the advertisers.<br /><br />In addition to  Flurry Analytics and Location Tracking, Table Tennis 3D features the following adware:<br />- AdMob<br />- AdSense<br />- Millenial<br />- MoPub<br /><br />*WHY* is the location tracking and the adware necessary in a PAID game?<br /><br />To add insult to injury, you also don't get the entire game you paid for unless you like them on Facebook. [NOTE: I played with the internet off, so I cannot say whether there are ads in the game or not.]  If you do like them, you get free coins. I didn't see any current use for coins, and must assume that the developer is planning on introducing some sort of IAP for coins. Maybe it'll offer bigger paddles or something. But right now, it seems useless.<br /><br />About the gameplay:<br />Despite being built on the gorgeous Unity platform, the graphics are dismally unattractive and boring. At least there is no annoying music, but there are sound effects.  Inside the game there is no way to turn off the sound effects or reduce their volume, so your device's volume controls will have to do. Plus, you can't simply exit the game with the back button; you must return to the main menu before exiting.  Keep in mind that if you do leave, it doesn't save the current game AND if you are in a competitive mode, the game considers you leaving as you forfeiting the game!  Very uncool.<br /><br />Trying to serve is an exercise in frustration and futility. I'm also wondering about how well the game keeps score. When I played, the score should have been 3-1, with me winning.  Instead, it was 2-2.  If there was a foul, then the game should have notified me.  It didn't. On the other hand, it doesn't do much in the way of giving you any kind of encouragement, information, or anything else that might make the game more interesting.<br /><br />There are three modes: Tournament, League, and Arcade.  Both Arcade and Tournament each have three subcategories, and League has rankings. I'd go on, but I was bored to tears after the first few games.<br /><br />This game's contents and permissions aren't as bad as Amazon has had in the past, but they're bad enough to avoid. Even if they weren't there, this game is, at most, three stars.  Absolutely boring and mediocre in every aspect.  NOT worty 99-cents even without the spying and adware!<br /><br />[EDIT: fixed typos and edited for clarity]e three subcategories, and League has rankings.

B007URVZJ6|4.0|I want to use this book as a reference. It is useful for my purposes and was recommended by a fellow writer. The format is easy to follow and has good chapter headings.
B005723JSQ|5.0|One of Sophie's best for sure! Would rather have read it through an actual book since the footnotes on mobile device is making it impossible to click on but other than that I would highly recommend it!!!
B00992CF6W|4.0|this game is okay but I am a little disappointed. no crops ever spawn in my world and worlds are so small. The game is great though and I love being able to make my own worlds and sharing them with my friends. The price is a little high but I recommend this game and hope that you will get it. Besides being small, the worlds are cool and I love being able to fight monsters.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|It is a very cool game, I especially love the variety of levels and think its an ingenious game! Love it
B00433SVP6|3.0|It was a good spin off of Percy Jackson but it was a little confusing with the Greek and Roman aspects coming together. I was misled by the advertisements in the back of Percy Jackson that stated that he was coming back, as he does not truly reappear in person, only by name. Overall a good read
B000O8OTNC|2.0|This is truly a &#34;get what you pay for&#34; case. The only thing that actually sharpens the knife is the Pen shape diamond cutter. Do NOT recommend buying this if you ever want a sharp knife.
B00C1B28Y2|5.0|IT LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE THE PICTURE, YOU WONT REGRET THE 30$  YOU SPEND ON IT ,THE DETAIL IS AMAZING!!! GET IT
B001GJ9GG8|4.0|A decent movie, but not a favorite.  Some average special effects.  The plot was mediocre, but enjoyable. Wouldn't watch it twice.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I have an account but it wont let me login. I tried making a new password didnt work. tried making a new accout wont work. need to fix. after fixed 5stars. oh yea im on a kindle fire
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Busy town builder.  Lots of different things to do in this game.  Building, fishing, farming, harvesting, and healing with plenty of different tasks to do.  Loads of fun for hours.
B003O86FMW|5.0|You won't want to stop reading it. Great sequel to the other hunger game books. You'd want to get this book
B000MU4EGY|5.0|Got this for a gift. It was requested by an avid Beatles fan. Has not received it yet, but I played it and it was a great vinyl.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|a real find 3 families linked with different problems . realistic lyrical narrative. length & ending are appropriate. Have recommended to many friends
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is a great adaptation of a great book, the performance of the three actors are amazing, the director and writer (that also wrote the book) made a wonderful job.
B007N5YIUS|3.0|Normally I really enjoy Angry Birds, but I didn't like the Space version as well as the others. The shooting in the round is odd and doesn't seem to really work that well.
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|It was intriguing and excellent Khaled Hosseini never let me down I couldn't put the book down looking forward to his next piece of art.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|It is not the best writing that I've read, but I loved the little twists and turns in it.  I would recommend it
B00EYN3HTA|5.0|I had to give Peter, Enchantment and Stardust - The Poems (Peter, A Darkened Fairytale) five stars.  Had I not already read Peter, A Darkened Fairytale I would want to read it now!  O'Brien has a way with words that makes them leap off the page and start making pictures in your mind.  I have never been a big fan of poetry but I certainly enjoyed these.  I plan to use them in my classroom to encourage my students to read, write and enjoy poetry.  Here is a virtual high five for William O'Brien - great work!
B000JMKTLO|1.0|While I understand this was Miss Flynn's first novel, it is not believable on any level.  It is hard to imagine any of these characters as real and the plot is just as ridiculous.  I enjoyed Gone Girl but cannot recommend this one.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|A wonderful game love it so much great for any horse lovers out there slow loading time tho but totally worth it in the end
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|We enjoyed the season and would have given it five stars but the ending was terrible. So bad in fact we're not sure we'll continue watching next season.
B008D28HYS|5.0|This is a nice game with no bugs to speak of on my Galaxy S4. Very very addicting game though. :-)
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|I really enjoy emoji pop! It makes u think of the problems n New ways to text to other friends! Highly recommend if u like a challenge
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I love that it is truly FREE! I also love that it sends a reminder informing you that it is time to practice. I am actually learning and retaining the  language.
B008N1V11U|5.0|It has extremely good graphics and from my knowledge doesn't crash. Right now is the time to buy it as well because it's only .99&cent; so if you like you Batman you really need to buy this game it's really fun and enjoyable.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|This game has a lot of Dragons.I have some of Dragons.I have air Dragon.I have in ash Dragon get the good game
0062255657|4.0|The Ocean At The End Of The Lane<br /><br />  By Neil Gaiman<br /><br />If you like creepy, crawly coming of age stories that will make you check under your bed for a few nights in a row, then this is the novel for you. And you and you and YOU! Author Neil Gaiman has done it again. Though this is his first adult fantasy novel in over ten years, it was well worth the wait. Since it's not very long, you'll want to buzz through it in one sitting, so find a comfy chair and get ready!<br /><br /> One of the clever story-telling techniques that Gaiman uses well is that you never know the main character's name. We'll call him X. The entire story is about a man looking back at a particular event that changed his life forever. Everything began by a pond, that's really not a pond at all, but something else entirely.<br /><br /> \\"It was only a duck pond, out at the back of the farm. It wasn't very big. Lettie Hempstock said it was an ocean, but I knew that was silly...\\"<br /><br /> Sometimes when an author uses back-story to fill in a characters history, it can ruin the pacing, not this time. This is an entire reflection novel and works so well you nearly forget where you started. There's an evil nanny, a worm that really grossed me and all sorts of nasty critters that wanna gobble X right up. He does get his comeuppance, but through some pretty amazing magical hocus-pocus, he's spared.<br /><br /> The only drawback was that I felt Gaiman was under pressure to finish. There was a huge rush to the end and it made me imagine some editor tapping his foot in the corner. There is the rather tried and true good wins over bad theme and yet it doesn't come across as preachy at all. Good reminder of the power of friendship and family and how money truly can't buy you happiness. One of the best attributes of this story is that Gaiman really nailed the setting. You're thrown into an English countryside back in the 70's and with all of his usual tricks of things not being as they appear, there is tons to consider as you're blown, blasted, chased and haunted right along with X.<br /><br /> It's hard to not give too much away and you really should read this, but there were two parts that really surprised/shocked me. I'll just hint at them. One is a bath scene with X's twisted Father and the other is the removal of this disgusting worm from X's little seven-year-old foot. There are some adult scenes that would not make this appropriate for children. Then again, kids know a heck of a lot more these days, you be the judge.<br /><br /> After all is revealed, there remain the three generations of Hempstock women who still live in the very same old farmhouse next to the ocean at the end of the lane. Well, two of them do, the other, well, she's (that would be Lettie) she's too much of the story for me to say much more. Let me simply mention that Lettie is the epitome of how far a young person will go in the name of friendship.<br /><br /> Oh, and did I mention the end? There really isn't one.there is tons to consider as you're blown, blasted, chased and haunted right along with X.<br /><br /> It's hard to not give too much away and you really should read this, but there were two parts that really surprised/shocked me.

B00AB7HESI|5.0|This game is so fun because it lets you create your own imagination, like if your thinking about something and you can express yourself by doing it on this awesome game. I absolutely love this game
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun for a free game. Makes you think. Wish there were more levels. Helps pass time when nothing else to do
B00BF11UM0|5.0|worth the time to see.  very entertaining.  saw this on a date and had a good post-movie discussion about the film.
B00CG5MVD6|5.0|A charming story of love and acceptance.  Benny is sweet and caring, but overwhelmed by his responsibilities for the care of his sister, Joon.  Joon is intelligent, naive, and a little wacky.  When off-beat Sam comes into their lives, Wow!  Anything can happen!<br />Their relationship is hilarious, sentimental, and entirely redeeming.  We enjoyed this movie so much that we sent e-mails to friends and family, urging them to search high and low to find it.
B005MVLI8A|5.0|Teen spirit is awesome. This is the first time I have had the opportunity to listen to Nirvana. The album is a classic. Nirvana was decades ahead of their time.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|My kids absolutely love this game, but I've had some problems with it completely crashing our first generation Kindle Fire.  It will also completely run-down the battery with no warning that it's getting low.  That's frustrating, but the kids do love the game, so we deal with it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|A WEALTH OF ENTERTAINMENT AND KNOW HOW ON COMMAND.  BEST RETIREMENT GIFT TO MYSELF BESIDES MY KINDLES AND MY DOG WINSTON.
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|This plays well on my phone.  I'm new to Kakuro in general and have found it to be a satisfying challenge.  This app has lots of style.  My only complaint is that it scores your play,  but doesn't explain the scoring.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Can't wait for Season 3 to be added. Great show, keeps you on the edge of your seat! Keep 'em coming!
B003THHIEM|5.0|I watch Castle because of Nathan Fillion as much as because it is a good show and I like cop shows. I first watched Fillion in Firefly. I loved Firefly and hated to see it go off the air, however, I have to say that Fillion is even better in Castle.
1427202303|5.0|Just as advertised. I had to read this book for a college class and I didn't have time so every time I was driving I listened to it. Great book!  Fast shipping!
B005HNMPBM|5.0|Even though the timeline seems a little off compared to the other X-Men movies, I still love this movie. Seeing the relationship between Hank, Raven (Mystique), The Professor, and Magneto gives the other movies more depth. My favorite scene is when Magneto pulls that submarine out of the water. Kool!!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I love all of the John Corey books.  They are very exciting and well researched.  I am reading the whole series.
B007IK44CK|5.0|The MI movies were entertaining. However MI2 was a bit tiring with the here a mask, there a mask. But this MI movie is downright good. The viewer can even forget that it is a vehicle for Cruise to show he's still young.
B009EQG80W|5.0|I loved this book which was recommended to me by a close friend. I have started sessions i<br /> With psychotherapy and although has been a struggle , has been good to find out more on the subject and to understand there is no quick fix. I. Through reading this book helped me to understand more of my relationship which has enabled me to gain more clarity in my life.<br /><br />With eternal thanks<br /><br />Allison
B006LXQID8|5.0|The French seem to have a gift for quirky comedy that nobody can duplicate. I loved this movie when it first came out. Have only seen it for the second time now, on Amazon. It is as fresh as ever. An extremely difficult style of comedy to pull off successfully.<br /><br />If you are not into subtitles, don't let that put you off. It is almost a silent movie, with minimal dialogue. Wonderful sight gags that you will never forget.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I love making puzzles, the bigger the better. Being able to do them on my kindle to pass the time when I am waiting makes the time pass quicker. The fact that you can choose your size is a nice touch.
B00C90T4QK|5.0|A nice mix of traditional rat pack pacing, swing and modern. Grat music to work by. Highly recommended for people into traditional pop with a twist.
B00EXVZZE8|5.0|Every time I play nyan wings it crashes and freezes but I love the song and it's great<br /><br />I love it
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved this book! Once I started I couldn't stop. I am ready to buy the next book Now! I have found a new author to love.
B00EP0KYDO|5.0|No one could have pulled it off as well as the Smiths! Great story delivered by two great performances from Will and Jaden Smith!
B0085W09ME|5.0|I have used a number of apps to find flights, but this is the first one that I have seen that had ALL the major airlines and routes included in its search (including Southwest).  I would highly recommended this app to anyone searching for their next flight.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|Just wanted to state how awesome this timer is and i never review or rate anything yo!  Extra fluff inserted here.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My gosh, I tried hard to avoid the hype of the Hunger Games, but I got drawn into it. This book is so much more than expected! The author draws you into the story and makes you feel like you're actually there and watching this unfold live. I could not put this down. I finished the entire book overnight an  I'm really gonna read it again! Definitely a great book!
B00E0SXNE8|5.0|The whole family enjoyed this movie.  It shows that the same family issues recur no matter what time period we are in.  A great feel good movie!
B006TF6WAM|5.0|Easy reading, some twists and interesting turns . It all unfolds at the end of the story  and you really wanted to get to the end of it to find out what happens and why.
B003G4W49C|5.0|At first  I wasn't very sure about this book. I had heard it was good, but to b  honest, I wasn't that much interested. How wrong was I. As I kept reading, it became harder and harder to put down. The whole plot was fun, exciting and genius. I definitely recommend it!
B007A4SDCG|5.0|I loved that this book gets right to the point and tackles exactly the issues which are at the heart of all our self sabotage and procrastination. No BS. And so well written. Can't wait to read it AGAIN!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Overall it is a fun game even without spending any money.  My kids love watching all the ice age characters.
0062068423|4.0|4.5 stars. Pay careful attention to the time stamps at the start of each chapter and you'll be able to keep up with the complex plot. Don't put the book down for long or you might lose the threads that make this story so fascinating.
B004CURZFC|5.0|the movie is all about my favorite animals, OWLS!! and it is just so awesome. and i just love it.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|This game  just fun. My best friend had this game on her ipad and i was so mad it wasn't on the kindle fire. Now i am happy.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I am a big fan of Ken Follett.  Winter of the World has great story lines mixed in with history, great characters, which spans the globe.<br />If you haven't done so please read Pillars of the Earth.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|This was one of the most riveting television dramas I have seen. It told a story in 8 episodes, and told it well.David Tennant and Olivia Coleman gave excellent performances. I highly recommend watching.
B0024Y9EYS|2.0|Does not live up to the content of the movies and the feel of the movies. I can see why it only saw two season runs.
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|Rodney is too much!! The action in this movie is nonstop amazing with surprising charaters. I was so filled w/excitement for all the special effects. GOOD! GOOD! Movie!!!!
B007FG9LIE|2.0|Very good book  would read again. Would  tell everybody to read it ready to start the next book now. Time to start reading.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|Love to switch to the Dark Side and back. Love the new graphics and the new challenges. Highly recommended. :)
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Read this book in two days. Great story line! And you can't beat the price. My first book purchase on my kindle.
B000HX6DCO|5.0|This movie will forever be a great classic film. With song, dance, killing Sadam Hussein, a homosexual Satan and inspiring a general hate for Canada.
B00E6895M6|5.0|this is the best album ever. I haven't bought an album in years but I was willing to shell out money for this. it feels like a 'best of' album and it's only her first. it's simply amazing.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What a great book!!! Looking so forward to starting the next book. I wasn't sure about this story at first glance but all of the reviews are spot on! The imagination of the author is wonderful and the story telling puts u right in the book. Great characters and a great read.
B00F8H0LM2|1.0|Have not idea if I would like this or not since I am unable to find the download on my kindle fire
B00BR4QNJ0|3.0|I do not care for this game, but grandchildren love it. Why so much about zombies I will never know. If it keeps them entertained that helps at times
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Love the different formations, especially those I have not seen before.  Some are harder than others, but all are challenging and fun.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This app is awesome  except it take as so long to load and everything is expensive but over all get this free app
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This app is a really fun & a great way to wile away the time waiting in line for anything.
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|Steelheart is not Sanderson's best but it was a good fast read. The story is engaging and the characters and plot are solid. I am just desperate for a Sanderson book with a little more heft to it. This feels like it was written to be a movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I liked this book, but my daughter liked it more. I went in thinking it was something different. My dauughter read it twice and told me to give a five star rating Would have given it that rating anyway, it was a good book.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|Dumb ways to die is hilarious. The characters are so cute and the music video is so catchy. Although one of the levels is messed up and you always die because the kindle has no microphone, the rest are fun, entertaining, and awesome!!! I totally recommend this game for someone in need of a good laugh. hope this helped!
B003NS1JHY|1.0|Top-notch talent in a mediocre film. Jolly joust? Sci fi romp? Not here! This is where stories come to die.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King never fails to amaze me! I loved finding out more about Doc and the whole shining storyline.<br />Doodlemom.cs@gmail
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Michael Crichton, move over. World War Z brings the contagion-gone-haywire concept to a whole new level. Great adaptation of the book's central theme. Zombies rising, and no one knows why: its an old concept given a fresh treatment. Great action meets good storytelling. Can you tell I liked it?
B00F56AZK4|5.0|I love to just play puzzles but<br />... I don't like to play in real life so this help a lot
B003ODIZL6|1.0|I do not like it. It is hard to find words. Not that user friendly. Total waste of no money! :)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Didn't have instructions for how to find tools or how to use them but it's easy to figure out and the ways to use the tools gets more complicated with successive levels. Love it!
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|David and Olivia were great.  Couldn't have asked for a better pairing.  Kept me on the edge of my seat.
B004MC0FO8|4.0|my wife and I love music. we are always asking each other who sings that song or what song is that. this app is a very quick and easy way to find all of that out. I love it.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Fun And easy to play like this game a whole lot. Glad I got it you should get it also . Great game
B002QCAXOS|5.0|This movie pulls you in little by little. Keeps you guessing right to the end.<br />You will be thinking about this one long after its over!
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|I like good well written well acted action movies. I liked this movie and all the Bourne movies at the theatre and at home.
B002QNTNL6|4.0|Good movie esp for younger people. I loved this movie. So heartwarming and real. Its a movie I watch many times and enjoy it as much as the first time
B000FBJHZS|5.0|I loved this book! Action packed with a \\"twist\\" in almost every chapter! Not my normal type of read so I was really impressed.
B00DJZR46G|2.0|I wish I could give all Elton reviews 5 stars but I won't lie or sugarcoat. I have seen Elton 40-45 times and in the 70's I would see him perform at several shows in 1 week at Madison Square Garden. If you are a die-hard Elton fan from the 70's,'The Diving Board' may not please you. I only enjoyed 4 tracks which are  `Can't Stay Alone Tonight',`The Diving Board',`Candlelit Bedroom' and `Home Again'(bonus track version). If you purchase this product,do yourself a big favor and get the one available at Walmart because it includes a dvd from a recent Bud Walton Arena show that lasts 93 minutes. I was in heaven again. I realize that Elton is getting older and his music has changed as reflected in his latest works, but The Diving Board' is too downbeat for me. It is a little sad for me that the bitch is not back yet.
B002SR2PKG|5.0|I read this when it first came out in the 80's, and have re-read it every few years. This is still my favorite King book, because it captures the essence of childhood so well -- and all the fears that come with it.
B00AYB1RGG|3.0|It is a fair, no brainer, way to kill time. Shows how the future &#34;might&#34; be. Takes a certain type of viewer to enjoy this movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Now, if only I could find some real ones... maybe in colors to match my decor...<br />But seriously this game is addictive when you're stuck someplace for a while
B00CL68NOG|3.0|I alway like the stars that are in this film.  The story was silly, and insulted my inteligence.  The script was way beneath the star quality, and it pushed the realism of life.  Would only reccomend if you particually like the cast or have nothing better to pick.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|I can't believe I never read this book before, it was great, a real page-turner. Ken Follett is the kind of author who appeals to both men and women.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|Brad Pitt stars as brad pit fighting zombies in a post apocalyptic Hollywood. Where he even has to inject himself with a deadly virus called Angelina Jolie.<br />Worth watching especially when he kills the billy bob Thornton zombie
B00BEIYP1W|5.0|Ron Howard has done a spectacular job on this movie, which recounts the rivalry between Niki Lauda and James Hunt in the 1976 Grand Prix season.  The personalities of both drivers are highlighted and the race scenes are riveting.  Driving my Miata home after the movie was a new experience, I'll tell you!  This will definately go into my personal video library.  (I was reminded of the 1966 film Grand Prix, another great Formula 1 racing movie.)
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|With US Ensemble series on hiatus for the summer, Broadchurch was a great summer series.  Another was Copper.  The suspense was heighten throughout the series and came to a great climax.
B005HEDI3K|4.0|The original series reborn! This remastered series preserves the feel of the original while enhancing those scenes that were limited by 1960s technology.
B000SW2ERC|5.0|So many space operas are about... Very little, really.  They rely on efects and big budget set pieces to hold your attention.<br /><br />Here, director Soderbergh, uses dialogue, and tence psychology to take us on a journey into both outter space as well as the inner space of our deepes fears and desiers.  To quote a line from the movie, &#34;we are in a situation that is beyond morality.&#34;<br /><br />This reboot of the 1968 snoozer is nothing short of a mind-bender that would have made Kubrick proud. Solid performances by top notch talent suck you into a story unlike anything you have ever seen in a film. There is nothing predicable here, and even on multiplal viewings new layers reveal themselfs, which to me is the benchmark of a clasic masterpiece.<br /><br />If you liked any if these: 2001, Gattica, Clockwork Orange, Blade Runner, Scilent Running, Moon, Another Earth, Metropolis, Planet Of the Apes or Watchmen, then you will likely love this.

B007SGLZP8|3.0|It drug on too long.  Probably a good story,but too much in between.  I guessed the ending before the middle of the book.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book truly is beautiful, full of philosophical wisdom and characters that you want to meet. I wish I could write as well as the author if only for the sake of leaving a proper commendation. 5 stars.

B00471TLZS|5.0|Our 10 year old wanted to see a grown up scary movie. After some reading up for ideas and guidelines on what would be appropriate, we picked Poltergeist. It was scary enough that she was impressed, but it wasn't bloody and gory.

B0001FR3IQ|5.0|While I am not a fan of the supernatural film, still I have seen many over the years. This one  I found to be special. Not that it was strikingly original.  I should think to the aficionado this might seem pretty tame and routine.  No matter. I found it quite entertaining and a fine way to spend part of an evening. A good deal of the pleasure must have been due to the star, Halle Berry. She was not only  very attractive and appealing, but carried off the acting chores with style. As one would expect Downey did a workmanlike job in a supporting role, Charles Dutton had little to do that would call on his talents, and the others were also up to what was demanded. A sort of exception was the guy who played the Sheriff who was up to par until called on for some difficult acting chores. I should think the general viewer would have a good experience; it is impossible for me to guess the reception of those who see this kind of thing as a fan.
B0039O3OKW|5.0|We bought the book for our grand-niece's fifth birthday.  She sent a lovely thank you, concluding with &#34;I loved the ladr&#34;!!
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|With some fine writing and directing for the occasion, Downey and Company give us  a second feast of a Holmes for the contemporary viewer. It should be added that this in no way overshadows the notable Basil Rathbone series of my generation ( I was already a regular movie-goer when Rathbone and Bruce took over the franchise assisted in the first production by Ida Lupino, among others.  The big difference to date in comparing them is that after the second or third production, the older series was shifted to \\"B\\" film status and no longer had first rate directors, writers or actors, aside from R&B. At any rate, this is a very different Holmes and has earned the right to be judged on its own merits, in terms of which, I think, it gets credit for a changed Holmesian character without, in any way, undermining the Holmes of the century and some odd decades preceding it. The most recent major Holmes presence, the late Jeremy Brett in an outstanding BBC series ended with his death, shows that the traditional characterizations can co-exist with serious contemporary efforts. ( One might enjoy the comic or psychiatric utilization of the Holmes ethos, but those have no impact on the main traditions.)<br />Robert Downey, Jr.  remains the acting spark which vitalizes the entire quite well-chosen cast. It is quite a  pleasure to see him in action. The supporting cast, as I have pointed out, deserves much credit as well.<br />All in all, this should be satisfactory viewing for most general viewers as well as action fans. As I have pointed out, I think that even traditionalist Holmesians may find this an admirable change of pace.
B004FRX0MY|2.0|Hi Amazon people, i know this is part of your policies but i think its not fair to restrict songs shopping if you dont live in the US. some of us are loyal customers over the years and at least we deserve to be elected to pay for music if we wanted to.

B00CRR5YA0|5.0|My only complaint with this as well as the soundtrack of the 2009 movie is the length and quantity of tracks on the album. The tracks are short and there could be more of them. All of the basic character and situation themes are present (some similar ones from 2009 evolved or elaborated on) here, but only in their infant forms.It would be nice to hear more of the nuances of each of the songs fleshed out as they were in the actual movie. Otherwise, a very great album.
B00DAXYNEI|5.0|Great show! I'm hooked. If you are a political junkie, this is the movie to watched. I can't wait to next season.

B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 was because I did not like the outcome of Tess' story. But other than that, it was a very entertaining read. I definitely will read more of this authors work. It reminded me a great deal of Marian Keyes. I laughed, cried, gasped. Highly recommended!!

B004DM1ZQY|1.0|Comp rolled double 5s then two double 6s in a row while I was rolling 1s and 2s to make 3.  With the best strat in the world it is impossible to beat that.  Nock his piece onto the bar, every time he rolls the exact number he needs to knock any of your uncovered pieces onto the bar in return. Undo to see if there is a way to cover... nope. Game just feels cheap.  Comp rolled 6 doubles in a single game to my 1.  This is common mind you.  Game is less fun when you feel like it cheats.

B00B2JSRAS|4.0|there is a big regret from my point of view on this amazing book. I wish author had used a more international language for composing this book. as a non-native English speaker I really struggle some times to get to the core concept. however, the lessons and approaches were new and fresh. every body can go through this handy book whenever felt disconnection from the goal.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Most excellent series.  Watching the daily struggles of women in positions of power, the poor vs. the rich and how they must depend on one another regardless of social, economical and personal situations is truly inspiring!

B004JN1D2I|5.0|I was definitely wrong!  I am an avid reader but have no interest in &#34;fantasy&#34; fiction.  Initially, when I was reading about the starks, it felt a little slow but it was because of tring to create the characters. Before I knew it, I was so engrossed in the book, I couldn't wait to read more and was then shocked when certain things happened in the story. That was when I realized that I had become so invested in the story and the characters. My emotions had become involved and I was escaping to this fantasy world with these characters on a regular basis.  I am on book 3 now and loving every minute of the story!

B00CW7KK9K|1.0|I was hoping this cute little device could deliver, but it didn't.  I walked from my office at work, all the way to the other end of the building and back again, counting my steps.  This device only recorded about half of my steps.  I did this several times throughout the day, with the same results.  I have a [[ASIN:B0049POHK6 BodyMedia LINK Armband Weight Management System]] which also records steps, but you can't read them until you plug the device into your computer at home.  I wore the 2 together, putting them both on at the same time.  My Bodymedia recorded 1000 more steps in the 5 hour period then the Withings device did.  My Bodymedia tells you how many calories you burn per day, this device is supposed to do that, but it said I burned 69 calories in 5 hours.  That is GROSSLY inaccurate.  It told me I was climbed 24 feet, yet I never walked up at all.  I was on flat surfaces all day.  It said I got 8 hours of sleep, yet my Bodymedia told me I got 6.5.<br /><br />Honestly, if you want a device that is more accurate, buy a [[ASIN:B0052KONSI BodyMedia CORE Weight Management System]].  I absolutely love it!!!  I have been using mine for almost 2 years now.  It tells you how much you sleep, and it breaks down when you woke up during the night, by the hour, so you can see what your sleeping pattern is.  It reads your vitals, so it knows how many calories you are burning, and how many steps you are taking.<br /><br />This device, was a major fail.  It's seriously too bad, because it is really a cute little gadget.  The only thing I feel was accurate, was my heart rate.  That is the only feature that the Bodymedia doesn't have.  However, you have to stop, pull this device out of its case and put your finger on the back to get your heart rate.  If you are wanting to know that, while you are exercising, buy a heart monitor like [[ASIN:B003AJGN5Y Polar FT4 Heart Rate Monitor]].  I have a really old Polar heart rate monitor, and it is extremely accurate in reporting my heart rate.  I use it at the gym, to let me know if I need to increase my heart rate during exercise.  It also tells you how many calories you burn during exercise.<br /><br />Seriously, don't waste your money on this.  Buy a Bodymedia instead.eart rate.

B00EU98VVC|5.0|Great concept album with a great storyline. Songs keep you interested and ready to slay for the Gods. The two covers at the end of the album are excellent. The cover of cemetery gates gave me chills. One of the best covers of that song I have personally heard. If your a Tyr fan, you will enjoy this album immensely. If your new to them GIVE IT A TRY!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I had heard about this game.  I am glad to try it for free.  It is fun.  During my down times I play.
B00821OW8K|4.0|I began watching the episodes of this series a few days ago, and found it to be entertaining for the most part.  As some of the reviewers have mentioned, there are lapses in the quality of the acting, but overall it does not too much detract from the viewer's enjoyment.  Generally speaking, there are times when the characters just don't appear to be very concerned with their situation.  Where it shows most often is in scenes with many players, and some in the background just have improper facial expressions?<br /><br />What prompted me to write a review is just this:<br /><br />Amazon has the first two years of the series available as part of the Prime program.  That means free live stream viewing.  The third year, however, must be purchased at this time, for $1.99 per episode or $19.99 for all 10.  That is something I am unwilling to do, and it makes me regret having watched the first two seasons.  I guess that this last season might become Prime eligible sometime in 2014?<br /><br />I think that the lesson here is: If I consider watching a series, I should first go to each year and see whether it is part of the Prime program, or whether one or more are only available on a purchase basis.  Then I can decide whether to watch only the ones which are Prime eligible, or none.  Or, I could pay for the non-Prime episodes.... (not likely!)<br /><br />UPDATE 12/18/13<br /><br />Glad I came to my account and looked over my reviews, so I could add this information:<br />Merely a few weeks after I mentioned that the third season was not available via Prime Online Stream, that changed.  I WAS able to watch all of the season 3 episodes, via that system.  No worries, mate.  Some of the action that goes on in the third season ... Well, nevermind, this is science fiction, and I did enjoy the series.
B00ACBN9CI|3.0|this game is a really great free dog fighting game. it would be better if it a a touturial and diffrent controls if it had all those things then it would have gotten a five from me. really great game.
B00C4GRGQY|5.0|As advertised, this book really does demystify  lighting.  A confidence builder for me.  I like that the majority involves using a horseshoe flash , on or near the camera.

B000002KDO|5.0|Had this LP many years ago and enjoy listening to it again. The sound quaulity is a lot better on a cd drive.
B00A0SJWQU|5.0|I had low expectations going into this one having enjoyed the original with Arnold. I was happy to see that the Mars colony had been left out. That took the original over the top and basically destroyed the story for me. I like the more gritty class and socio-economic issues in this version because it made the story much more believeable. One peoples oppressing another on such a global scale makes you think about things we do today. At not so deep... The technology is very believable and you can the extrapolation from the tools and devices,we have today. That makes it more fun for me. There could be a continuation of the story because now the elevator is broken  but the angry neighbors are still there.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is probably one of the best books I have ever read in my life. People may say that the characters are unrealistic but I think that yes, they may be but that's not what matters! This book is amazing. I recommend!
B005PV81MS|4.0|I liked the unique way the movie portrayed an alien invasion. Not aliens trying to take Earth's resources but Earth simply in the way of extra terrestrial procreation.

B0051E9JNE|5.0|The first and probably  the best movie in a five part series, the Highlander captures humor, drama, and action in a unique combination. The movie's storyline is well developed with few noticeable plot holes. It also combines a love of history with a futuristic science fiction taste. Also if you love well choreographed sword play and epic musical numbers by the band &#34;Queen&#34;, then this is the movie for you. Please note however this movie does contain adult content and should not be watched by persons under the age of twelve.
B00846REIS|5.0|Awesome book!! I fell in love with FSOG and read the whole series in two days this series is not much different if you loved Christian grey you will definitely love Gideon Cross. No doubt about it (:

B004PGO25O|5.0|The basics presented in an unmittigated way. We all need a shot in the butt once in a while, a reminder, to proceed with our timeline in a productive fashion. Every page was not only a reminder, but also, a new way of looking at our situation. The book presents many helpful tools for the reader who wants to focus on personal progress.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|But it just wasn't for me.  Many friends have found it fun but didn't do that for me as I  couldn't<br />get into it.

B008XG1X18|5.0|This app is fantastic. If you are a fan of the online version, I would recommend this app. It does everything you can do on the computer plus, you can save images and pins straight to your Kindle.
B0059WTMLW|5.0|I absolutely love this app! I've played nearly 1500 games since I got the app in June.  The UI is very nice, and the different difficulty levels are clearly defined. Unlike a lot of other apps, the increasing difficulty of each puzzle feels linear, rather than having arbitrary jumps between levels.
B00BG5CXGM|5.0|Fits well and protects the phone well. Love the dodger blue and will be ordering a few more color inserts. That is a great feature.
B002QNTNL6|3.0|Fairly predictable, but well acted for the most part.  Hard to imagine why the people involved would have done what they did for the opening premise, but, then, this is the movies.

B00A0NOF7G|3.0|Lexy is suspected of killing her ex-boyfriend when he is murder with poisoned cupcakes from her bakery.  It turns out that the detective in charge of the case is the yummy neighbor she just met.  Since her bakery is closed until the site and ingredients are cleared, she decides to do some investigating on her own.  When she explains the situation to her grandmother, she is amazed to discover that Nans and her friends spend their time trying to solve mysteries, especially murder and they are eager to help clear her name.<br /><br />Over all fun but Jack's reluctance to consider her as a true suspect because he likes her bothers me as does some of the word choices.  With a little more editing, this could be a delightful cozy mystery.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|This is my favorite game but it keeps uninstalling itself. I'll go back to play it and although the app icon is still there, it's gone.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I loved this book because I empathized with these women.  Being a woman myself, I was fortunate enough to be born and raised in America.  I can't fathom being treated the way these women were treated.  It was a heartbreaking story, but brings so much to light, and puts freedom in perspective.  I will never take my freedom for granted again.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Absolutely the most brilliant casting I have ever seen in a film.  The actors portraying the original Star Trek TV series characters are perfect for the roles.  It is as though the actors in this movie are not younger versions of the characters but are truly younger versions of the actors in the original series.  Love this movie.  One of my favorite parts is when McCoy tells Kirk that he is where he is because his ex-wife got everything on the planet in the divorce and left him nothing but his &#34;Bones.&#34;
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It tok me a few chapters to get into it but then it was so hard to put down. I loved it and am excited to read the next one.

B001UTW7QU|5.0|A very fun show that reminds me of the X-Files, but with fewer fluffy episodes. Every episode in this series directly reflects the on-going story line. The acting is great and it has an actual well planned end to the series.
B00DDUIW18|3.0|Very good book, for the CCNA certification. i think the should improve the index, The &#34;parts&#34; are listed on the index but not the chapters, so whe i want to go to a chapter i have tho go througth index, then part, and then tap continuosly to get the chapter i want to read.
B000FBJFSC|3.0|An English teacher wrote a book full of run on sentences, improper punctuation, and no real finish.<br /><br />While it's a gripping story, with some interesting history, it would be easier to read if we knew who was saying what, which is the point of quotation marks.

1400067820|3.0|\\"Antifragile\\" changed my thinking, mostly by reinforcing what I already knew so that it figured more prominently.  It has all kinds of nuggets and interesting references.  Taleb's personality can be fun, despite his bombast, rudeness, arrogance, defensiveness.  I do not rate the book higher because it is too long for what it has to say, being very wordy and redundant.  All of this is for fear the reader will not understand.  Taleb is also careless in his claims, and dislikes qualifying them.<br /><br /> Taleb uses evolution as an example of antifragility, but I can elaborate on his discussion.  There is evidence that certain parts of the genome are more susceptible to mutation than others, and a theory is that this increases adaptability.  If  there were no need to adapt for too long, the potential for adaptability might decrease as mutations become more random; hence shocks make the future of life, but not of the individual, more secure.<br /><br /> Taleb in his approach reminds one of Edmund Burke, the 18th century philosopher I was required to read in school (that may date me).  The \\"organic\\" which evolves over time is favored over the \\"rational\\".  Interference is to be distrusted; Taleb would limit it to cases where the negative consequences of inaction are severe and outweigh the unknown dangers of interference.  Practitioners such as doctors and bureaucrats prefer interference even when there is little evidence of efficacy.  Similarly, optimization tends to make the system more vulnerable to deviations from the assumptions upon which the optimization is based.  If a probability distribution is involved, be especially wary, as it is so hard to get a true handle on the tails.  Always favor robustness over optimization.<br /><br /> I loved the example of the two brothers.  One, in his fifties, has a secure job in the personnel department of a large bank, while the other is self employed as a London cab driver, with great variability in daily earnings.  Yet when the \\"black swan\\" of the financial crisis occurs, it is the cab driver who is more secure.  (though upon reflection as I write this, perhaps the banker could take the time to master the London street system and become a cab driver).<br /><br /> A nugget is the idea that to forecast the future, look at what has survived  for a long time in our current world, like bicycles.  The trick to me though is how to define the item: is it books, as Taleb thinks, or a medium for storing the written word?
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Leave Epic for the Kids.<br />Under the Dome is great<br />Star Trek Into Darkness was awesome!<br />Now You See Me was enjoyable.
B00C7TAF3Y|1.0|I purchased this and was very eager to play. Graphics are nice from what I have seen, but I can't even make it through the first puzzle. I zoom in on object, but then it won't let me back out so I can look around some more. I am playing on a kindle fire HD. All other games play fine, except this one. I am scoring one star because I have to quit game to get out of zoomed areas. Very, very frustrating!!
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|A great show with many twists and turns. And the music is darn good! Especially the last blues riff during the ending credits.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|&#34;Dredd is a very violent movie but well made nonetheless. It was mostly well acted and written. Typical post-apocalyptic gangland fare, but the dialogue was quite bare. That seemed to reflect the personality of the main character. Dredd never speaks unnecessarily or at length, which I appreciate.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Good for a light read. The part that I especially liked was the epilogue. So often we don't see things as they really are and we torture ourselves with &#34;might-have-beens&#34; and &#34;what-really-happened&#34;.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|Dungeon Hunter keeps me on my toes. enemies come from everywhere. Haven't figured out how to get all the boxes checked yet, but it is very challenging-at least for me.
B008JFUTUY|2.0|I gave the film two stars because it was superbly assembled. Unfortunately, it was largely assembled from defective parts.<br /><br />First off, I love Rodriguez's music and think he'd definitely a neglected musician. However, the film starts with that premise and then goes on to ignore any facts that challenge it. Cracked.com wrote an excellent piece on the film:<br /><br />\\"The documentary tells us that Rodriguez is a guy who put out two extremely obscure albums in the '70s, had zero success, quit music, and became a regular Joe. That makes for a great story -- the idea that the guy threw the albums out there and dropped off the map, unaware that his work had become huge on the other side of the globe years later. Well, we don't know about you, but we haven't met any regular Joes who spent years touring Australia with bands like Men at Work and Midnight Oil.<br /><br />Yep, Rodriguez was a huge sensation in Australia in the late '70s and early '80s, with his singles shooting up the charts for over a year. One of the fans from the documentary is a record shop owner and a massive Rodriguez nut -- surely he'd heard of his 1981 live in Australia album? Maybe he listened to it and figured the huge crowd cheering for the guy at the beginning was in some tiny Detroit cafe. Also, the name of the album is Rodriguez Alive, so maybe he should have taken it as a clue.<br /><br />It's true that Rodriguez's work didn't catch on the U.S. before the film, and that he wasn't aware of his popularity in South Africa, but to paint him as a criminally ignored genius is absurd. He enjoyed a sterling career lasting over a decade before his 15 minutes were up and he was forced back into the real world, making his story about as remarkable as any '80s hair metal band (that is, if Blackie Lawless inexplicably became the poster boy for the Egyptian revolution, which -- can we make that happen?). That might explain why he seemed so underwhelmed when he met up with the filmmakers.\\"

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I've found a new favorite author. &#34;The Husband's Secret&#34; is thought provoking and thoroughly fascinating. I couldn't put it down. All the characters are well-drawn and they each offer some trait I can identify with. You won' t be disappointed in this book!
B00190OHD6|5.0|Everything you want in a chick flick! I love the James Blunt song at the end, &#34;Same Mistake&#34; and extra features.
B003274QH6|5.0|definitely recommend this show and blu ray to anyone.  If you're going to watch a great show, may as well watch it on blu ray. Enjoy!
B008602KQI|5.0|Interesting & visually stunning; I haven't read the book, so this review is based on the film only (not the adaptation of the story to the screen)
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|It moves quickly.  It has twists and turns that kept me entertainment.  For those so inclined, it also raises questions of an existential nature. . . . .I've recommended it to friends.
B005HED11Y|5.0|really enjoyed revisiting Captain Kirk and Star Trek.  It's great fun for the whole family and some very philosophically interesting plots that still resonate today
B008469DGY|5.0|A great way to kill some time without having to play a full course. I hate having to spend a lot of time playing long games when I don't really have a lot of time.
1250012570|5.0|Briefly: She's just standing there on the bus, this big red-haired girl in the weird clothes, waiting for someone to let her sit. Hoping against hope that she doesn't sit next to him, Park refuses to look at her. Next thing he knows, she has to sit. They spend a few days like this on the bus, an uncomfortable, angry silence, making sure that they don't touch. Steve's girlfriend, Tina, starts a campaign of torment. Eleanor can't help it that she's so noticeable. She's the kind of girl who stands out no matter how invisible she tries to be. Especially at home, especially with him.<br /><br />As it happens with many \\"opposites attract\\" stories, this tale begins with a couple of teens who couldn't be more different. There is a wall built between them that day on the bus; but as Park observes and Eleanor quietly lets down her defenses, they may just find something wonderful. How they get together is a study in patience, tenacity and sheer chutzpah. Because Eleanor lives with torment and sadness and Park feels like trying to hang on to Eleanor is like trying to hold air.<br /><br />Didja Like It?: I loved this book. The entire tale, the way it was told, alternating between Park and Eleanor was wonderful. They each saw the world so differently, and because both of them were people of few words (or unwilling to give up secrets), the journey from bus seat combatants to their touching relationship was incredibly vivid, real, horrifying, meaningful, painful, scary and wonderful all at once. In a word, it was authentic.<br /><br />I also thoroughly enjoyed the secondary characters. They were so solid, expressing everything from a scary fury to a beaten-down timidity to a bewildered sort of parental love. But when the good needed to come through, they did. And when the bad were supposed to be evil, they were. It just wasn't necessarily when you expected.<br /><br />Anything Else to Mention?: The end, with Tina and the revelation about [something something] and the unknown bits and the yeah and that...I can't wait to read Ms. Rowell's next book in hopes that it is at least 60% of what I just read. `Cause then it'll still be more significant than approximately 75% of the books I have ever read. Phew.<br /><br />To Read or Not To Read: Absolutely, unless having these characters live in your head long after the book is finished bothers you. Because they will take up space in your noggin and you will find that you are hugging yourself a little more often for a few days. And looking for tall, pale girls with huge amounts of red hair. Because you've got to. For Park.<br /><br />Eleanor & Park by Rainbow Rowell was published February 26, 2013 by St. Martin's Press.

055358202X|1.0|After three wonderful exciting books we get a book from another world. What is going on?? I don't want another hundred characters that relate to nothing. I'm not sure I will even purchase Book 5 in the series, what a waste of time reading this dribble. SAVE YOUR MONEY!
B008BQ8YHQ|2.0|Not really my feeling of entertainment. Too much arguing and bad attitudes plus I don't like the rude language. Crap
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Never gets old & New games constantly appearing.  Wish chests would give up some new items and doubles on power ups should give double chest prizes too.  Use parental controls because temptation to buy extra credits is great...great game!
1451695195|5.0|Dr. Alexander's retelling of his journey into and out of a coma is insightful, informative, and thought-provoking. In addition to offering practical knowledge about the emotional/cognitive stages that a patient, their family, and caregivers might be experiencing, his account would be useful to anyone researching the purposes of life from a philosophical or religious stance.<br /><br />His summary perceptions in Chapters 33 and 34 offer clues about the functions of consciousness and their possible indications of what roles humans--as a species--may have in the expanding universe. Eben Alexander also contributes to the conversation about why humans have a unique capacity for compassion and feeling and its meaning to Creation.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a good game if you have 5 minutes or hours to play. The variety of scenes means it's never boring.
B00BQPEIT2|3.0|It's alright but I don't care for it much. Cuz my ipad is to wide. My kindle it's just right but still to hard to navigate. Maybe my hand is too small. The app is ok.
B004R1VXYU|5.0|I was messing around on YouTube and found this band. I loved a couple of the songs I listened to and decided to buy it. Definitely worth the money. I love all the songs on here and that's hard to find with any band now a days. It reminds me of folk, 70's rock, and a little country. Very cool!!!!
B006DJ2JSI|3.0|I don't use it my kids do. So to tell the truth I don't know anything about this app. All I can say is try it.
B007EW9ISM|4.0|Wonderful to draw and sketch, not for details.  Use it often and I'm very satisfied with my purchase.  Perfect companion for the Paper iPad drawing app.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I carry a lot of equipment in my bag.  This is the perfect bag to take with you on the go.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Excellent adaptation of Conan Doyle's stories by bringing Holmes  and Watson into the 21st  century. With great writing that uses the original story lines with ingenious twists.
B001QWBM62|5.0|Yep, this is the one to get.  No problems, no figuring out which setting is best.  It just works.  plug it in and be amazed or use the very responsive internal mic.
B00D3NSDVO|5.0|A very imaginative and enthralling book - it was incredibly difficult to put down and I wished I had a second book by the same author ready to read. Very well written and most enjoyable.

B001RTSPVY|4.0|~~~~SPOILERS APPEAR LIBERALLY THROUGHOUT THIS REVIEW~~~~<br /><br />DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED BREAKING BAD Season 2.<br /><br />Amid all the darkness of BREAKING BAD's second season there is light, and generous pockets of laugh-out-loud comedy.  The funniest dialogue spills from the mouths of characters not around in the first season.  Skinny Pete's nonchalant delivery of \\"Feng Shui, yo!\\" comes to mind.  A man of Skinny's limited intelligence would not even know how to spell Feng Shui, let alone pronounce it.  Yet the expression rolls off his tongue as if he were intimately versed in the Chinese concept.  And that's one of the throwaway lines.  The best ones come from Saul Goodman, a one-of-a-kind criminal who happens to be a practicing member of the Bar.  The first time I saw 'Better Call Saul' I thought the suits should give good ol' Saul a show of his own.  And they did!  One can't help but accept Saul's deliberate smarmy approach, his license plate is LWYRUP, typical of his sense of humor.  His multitude of underworld connections yields a number of interesting personalities who aren't funny at all; suffice to say they're scary and realistic people.  Chief among them are Gus, slight in stature, mild-mannered and walks without moving his arms but seethes menace; and the damage control expert to whom Saul conveys complex instructions in cryptic Saul-speak: \\"I think we got a wife problem.\\"<br /><br />Danger keeps looming up more and more around Walter and those he loves.  Jesse has an intense side-story (without Walter but with consequences) that concludes with him holed up in what looks like a native American Indian sweat lodge.  Walt Jr. AKA Flynn becomes quite a forceful personality taking turns hating both his mother and his father.  Flawlessly portrayed but totally unlikable Hank Schrader becomes slightly less overbearing, i.e. a bit more likable.  Not a lot but a bit because some chinks in his armor are divulged.<br /><br />BREAKING BAD Season 2 has a lot going for it, wonderful writing, acting and photography, the outdoor scenes make me want to move to New Mexico.  If one looks closely enough a lot of the pre-credit openers are out-and-out tributes to Sergio Leone.  Clever, subtle, nice.  Why four stars instead of five?  There's only one bad show out of all 13, 'Four Days Out,' with Walter and Jesse stranded in the desert without water for a boring amount of time.  This dispensable episode drags unbearably and, although not laborious to watch, is curiously slow compared to the show's regular frenetic pace and seamless weave of multiple interconnected storylines.  That alone doesn't merit a four-star rating.<br /><br />I felt cheated by the plane crash finale though horrified just the same.  Cheated because the whole second season previewed images of Walter's shattered windshield and body bags in his driveway begging to mislead the viewer into thinking two of the White family die by violence.  The last show of the second season opens by panning back from the driveway to a panoramic wide angle shot that includes the smoke of two separate fires burning behind his house.  I wondered what that meant until Jane's father was revealed as an air traffic controller then immediately knew he would cause a crash.  BREAKING BAD is not a mystery story, per se, it doesn't need such unnecessary misdirection, sufficient tension existed without it.  Those flash forward images DO ratchet up viewer suspense.  Except in the end the payoff is undercut bigtime, yo!lot going for it, wonderful writing, acting and photography, the outdoor scenes make me want to move to New Mexico.

B00D6B4PUG|4.0|connects readily to gmail. I use it to access gmail only.  Occasionally it uses a round about way, but that may be more my inexperience.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|5 star app if i can see a daily and weekly calendar, anybody know how? Id appreciate it!<br />I love the note pad,, and the sorting feature.  Exactly the app ii need.  A quick tutorial would be great
B00F35B8F8|4.0|Fast paced and entertaining.  I'm not a Star Trek fan, and I still really enjoyed it. Well worth renting this.
0060245867|5.0|My boyfriends favorite book as a child. The whole series is fantastic- giving it away as a baby present. Awesome pictures!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Forces you to think.  Good brain workout.  I like all the escape floor Aps.  It helps me to relax and its fun.
B00F5FBE82|4.0|Not too much difference from last album but I am still a fan and will continue to listen over and over
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|One of the best shows I have ever watched, well written very entertaining.  I have watched this 3 times, can't get enough.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was a very sad story but also enlightening how these kids and families dealt with their terminal illnesses.<br />I liked how they received strength and supported each other.
B005544TRQ|5.0|One of the best shows I have ever watched, well written very entertaining.  I have watched this 3 times, can't get enough.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|This show is definitely watched by so many people because it really is that good. May take an episode or two to really get into it, but once you do you won't be able to stop watching.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I loved this book because of the awesome writing and it always brought tears to my eyes throughout the story. I can't describe how much I loved this book.
B008LVCKH6|4.0|A great story about going with the flow, taking advantage of opportunities and one persons place in history. This book was very funny and informational at the same time.
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|Good fast-paced fun for teenagers and tweens (if you can fast forward over one silly scene).  I'm not sure if teenagers were their intended audience, but with secret societies and the constant need to avenge and/or prove themselves...it certainly felt like a teen movie.  Still, it was a good story and visually cool enough to let some of the silliness slide.
B000NY12CI|4.0|This book is a must read for anyone who wants a greater understanding of one of the major clash of cultures in the modern world.
B0030M3SBI|5.0|This was a time during Hendrixs career, when he was still trying to find his &#34;new sound&#34; It was recorded on New Years eve 69-70, one of three shows that night. The guitar playing is his best, especially &#34;machine gun&#34; which is an unbelieveable rendition of this classic song. His playing is sublime, deep, and truly unbelieveable, anyone who doubts he's the best guitar player, listen to this album. You can hear the rest of this concert on &#34;Live at the Filmore east&#34; but most of the playing on LATFE, is rough and more raw, than BOGL. Both albums are good, but if you want to hear Hendrix at his absolute best, but BOGL
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great show I would recommend it to anyone interested in a great law drama. Better than law and order yay
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|LOVE THIS GAME IT IS BEST EVER<br />YOU SHOULD REALLY PLAY THIS GAME BEST EVER<br />I LOVE THE SUITS IN THIS GAME
0385528787|2.0|Shouldn't great trilogies build to an exciting climax? (A la Lord of the Rings or Dark Materials.) \\"Oryx and Crake\\" is a great, edge-of-your-seat read, but The Year of the Flood and now Maddaddam just sort of dribble along, mostly backstory and annoying digressions (like the story of Zeb and the bear - ugh). Snowman/Jimmy just sorta gets thrown in there, in a half-hearted way. I wish I'd stopped after book one.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|This is an excellent follow-up to books one and two with some gripping episodes and shocking developments. The style is less American-idiomatic which is more appropriate to the setting, both chronological and geographic. Another great yarn, much better than the (very good) tv version.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love it. If u love romantic stories u will live this. Great acting. Great story. So so good. Watch it!
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Perhaps after three in the same series both the reader and the writer need a change: George Martin certainly delivers it. His style is different, more archaic at times and more aloof. So much so that I even thought it might be a another, or a series of other authors.You regret that he abandons key and appealing characters, but at least some of the old guard are still there and you know that the favourites are bound to return in later episodes. I like being led to see the POV of some 'evil' characters and watch them bring about their own downfall. It is a little disconcerting to lose touch with certain elements, such as what is happening in the far north and over the sea. On the other hand the development of some of the main characters is intriguing. Martin keeps you guessing.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|Games great if you have a decent tablt very challenging I generally stick to 3v3 rather then the 5v5 due to some layers lagging out but overall its a solid game
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Very easy to use, quick and effective sharpener.  If you don't have hours to sit there and use a sharpening stone, this is for you.  I especially like the diamond rod for sharpening the hooked blade of my Woodsmans Pal.
B00F91SCXC|3.0|Movie was Okay. I wouldn't buy it nor would I desire to see it again. Watched it because Brad Pitt was in it.
B00594XOZU|5.0|It is awesome but I learned that it is not available for kindles right now. I have tried to log in but it always says login failed. Weird thing is that I can get in on an Ipad but not kindle.
B0030SZ2D4|3.0|If you don't know about this flick already, it's kind of formulaic. Vin Diesel got noticed as a result of starring in it, and went on to make several more movies in which he plays similar characters. Nice effects, good guys, bad guys, monsters, etc. A good Friday night movie at home.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have read all three in less than a week loved them all started after friends an finished before them all very pleased thank you  wish it was me
B00EY8A6BC|4.0|This was a great movie. Glad I got it HD. It had me wondering who was doing what on the movie and what were the tricks behind their magic. Great movie overall.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I love this game. It's extremely addictive. I hope it stays this fun.I could play this all day. Exciting game.
0765356139|5.0|Sanderson writes a incredibly complex story without over doing it. Politics, tiny bit of romance, and science fiction all rolled up nicely.<br /><br />Great read!
B00F5FEZTC|3.0|This album is pleasant to listen to but nothing really jumps out at first hearing. I think it will probably be a grower on repeated listenings, but just not in the same class of other recent releases
0765350386|5.0|I loved the book. Sanderson writes a very interesting story. Just enough politics to keep it interesting.<br /><br />However when it was shipped it arrived with the front cover bent in half. Definitely more damaged than new, as it had been described. But did not ruin the read- it still worked like a book.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Halfway threw it,it is what it is life is short with open mind youve got to work on your bucket list.
0765356147|5.0|Best ending of a series ever! Everything was explained and or tied up, nothing left dangling for you to wonder.<br /><br />Great ending to an awesome series.
B00821PCJS|5.0|The plot is good.  Acting is OK..  not great but I enjoy it.  I think just because the plot is good.
B001BANK32|5.0|This is the first Stephen King novel I read, almost 20 years ago.  I am re-reading it to reacquaint myself with the Torrance family to better appreciate Dr. Sleep.
B003Z0BWT0|4.0|Kept the suspense going and read still interesting  characters are great and makes<br />U want  to read non stop so the next part of the story can unfold. All the books were great and well<br />Worth the time it took to read them .. Once you start the first book you will just keep reading and reading<br />to get though the story , lots of interesting story lines thoughout the five books I hope the movies do<br />the books justice.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|Its mainly Brad Pitt carrying the whole movie with his name ,was really let down ,maybe one of worst pictures Brad has played in , visual effects are great and unbelievable as that was high light of whole movie .
B00DU77QP2|4.0|Great read really enjoyed the whole series of books and movie good too<br />I just hope the other movies  live up to expectations too
B0068THAGY|2.0|kind of grabs you early with the kids but lost interest as movie moved on into later parts.would not watch again.
B00C5R7F8G|4.0|I am only 70 pages into the book and while the reporting around the accident in Arkansas with the ICBM in the damaged missile silo comes off as well researched and probably accurate, the passages early on the book seem casually researched, if at all. I have read \\"The Decision to Use the Atomic Bomb,\\" by Gar Alparovitz, and I think the research of Dr. Alparovitz and other since have shown that the official story that the bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki to force Japanese surrender which is repeated by Mr. Schlosser in this book has largely been discredited, and it tends to lead me to question the academic rigor of the research behind the rest of the book. I think he should consider reworking that section in later editions of the book.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|it's a great show!!!! It's a interesting story, with fascinating little daily review. You could watch it for fun, but you also need to watch it to reflect Ur self.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is the best app in the WORLD! You can play MINECRAFT on mobile devices! I just wish they would add more PC like features.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|This book is quite a let down after book 3. His pacing is off and there a chunks that are boring and hard to get through.<br /><br />Book 4 and 5 take place at the same time, he just focuses on different stories in each book. Daenarys, Tyrion, Stannis, and Jon Snow don't show up here. You have to read about them in book 5. I found this awkward and think it contributed to the pacing problem. Also, sometimes a storyline in this book would refer to a storyline happening at the same time period, only told in book 5, and would give something away, which I absolutely hated.<br /><br />All that said, the world and characters Martin has created are amazing and I can't get enough. Went directly from book 3 to 4 and now to book 5 without a break.  I will go through serious withdrawal when I'm finished with book 5... just like all the other fans who are anxiously awaiting book 6.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|I love this app. It does fascinating things,u can create memes and touch up any flawes. I would totally recommended this app.
B004UNX1LS|5.0|This is cool to be able to watch music videos that my kind of stuff,  i hope that kindle fire have some more good apps
B0026WNGBA|5.0|It is great but not having the dvd they talk about is a real bummer. I guess if you get the kindle version they think you don't need the dvd? Good information made my running life a lot happier!
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|As an adventure game lover I really liked this game, I would recommend getting it to anyone else who likes this game genre .
B00F91RYL8|2.0|More or less I consider myself a person with average tastes with a penchant for reading and wanting to explore the worlds created by any myriad of authors past and present. As someone who fell in love with World War Z even before it was a fully fleshed out book, when it could just be considered an offshoot of the back pages from the Zombie Survival Guide. I come to find myself here, driven to write a review of this movie that I can almost say is the worst movie that I have seen. However, I say that with a grain of salt since the source material left me near an excited state for this release; but like any tragedy, there is the desire to keep on looking and witness it with my own eyes.<br /><br />Now to actually review it, I shall agree with a popular internet personality and dub this movie henceforth, Brad Pitt Zombie Action Movie. Their are two things that this movie shares with its written counterpart; and those things are the title, and the use of the word zombie. The rest is an entirely original story with new ideas, of which are a perversion of the world that Max Brooks took the time to craft. If this didn't have the name attached to it, but rather was presented as a new cash grab zombie film, it could be okay. But the obvious changing, ignoring, and outright trashing of events, stories, and ideas presented from either the Zombie Survival Guide or the novel World War Z; will mar this movie from being seen as anything but trash in my eyes.<br /><br />I had hope, there was a dream for further sequels to turn it into a better movie, a better story, and a better representation of the overall experience from the books; but I now see that if you truly enjoy the idea of a zombie apocalypse, you are better off with the books (written or audio, which you can purchase here on Amazon). They'll far outlast the flotsam of this movie.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|The game is fun the demo needs to be longer I will be making a course  but the demo will end it is not fun when the demo ends.
B00F91SCXC|2.0|Low quality HD video.  Low imagination (creativity) when travelling from one country to another.  And the cure proof of concept to this outbreak is something difficult to believe in an human been.

B004GHNIRK|3.0|Not what I expected. I did not know it would  be so detailed and drawn out. I did not read too much of it.

1401235425|2.0|Yet another writer who writes Bruce Wayne as if he's got Wolverine's mutant healing factor. I'm starting to think it's now a genre conceit that multiple stabbings(and towards the end...a grotesque impaling)are the rough equivalent of a leg cramp. Scott Snyder's Batman doesn't even require food apparently. This guy is either imbued with superhuman powers, or will be permanently disabled within the next 2 months of cape duty.<br /><br />The story is mostly interesting up until the irritating revelation of re-animated undead assassins. Few things are more tedious than enemies who get up and dust themselves off after falling from a skyscraper. Although I have no reason to believe THIS Bruce Wayne couldn't do the same thing.<br /><br />Side note: my trade paperback had a few pages bound upside down. That's a new one on me. It would have bothered me more if I was actually enjoying what I was reading.
B008NIS2SS|5.0|The burning question based on some other reviews is, 'how is the sound?' My copy of this set has zero problems with either the media or the sound. Perhaps some of the complaints are from a bad run of pressings that escaped quality control. For the record my set is about six months old (purchased elsewhere.)<br /><br />When it comes to these sets the second question is invariably, 'what does it contain?' These Real Gone Jazz sets are notorious for scant documentation, but I have provided the tracks included since there is no track list on this page at the time of this review. I have also added background information on each of the included albums so you have some context regarding personnel and sessions.<br /><br />Basically this set is comprised of four discs that contain five albums led by Evans (including his debut album), one co-led with Bob Brookmeyer, and one of the three Cannonball Adderley led albums on which Evans participated. More importantly, this set contains the first and last albums on which bassist Scott LaFaro appears with Evans.<br /><br />Note: I have linked to the source albums that comprise this set and most have sound samples associated with their pages. The albums contained in this set are as originally released, so if the linked albums have more tracks than are cited here it's because reissues sometimes have bonus tracks or alternate takes not on the original releases. Here is what is on the album:<br />===========<br />DISC ONE<br />===========<br />[[ASIN:B000UBHXHW New Jazz Conceptions]]. Evans' first album as a leader. Recorded for Riverside at the Reeves Sound Studio in NYC on September 18 and 27, 1956. Evans is solo on the September 18 tracks (1, 8 and 10), and is backed by Teddy Kotick on bass and Paul Motian on drums on the other session.<br />01. I Love You<br />02. Five<br />03.

This is a jointly led album by Bob rookmeyer and Evans that was recorded for United Artists at the Olmsted SouBnd Studios in NYC on March 12, 1959. Brookmeyer is on piano with Evans (an interesting change from Brookmeyer's valve trombone), and they are backed by the Modern Jazz Quartet's Percy Heath on bass and Connie Kay on drums.<br />04.

B0009P5YXO|3.0|It's okay but feels really cheap, like it was made of cruddy plastic. It works and functions just how it's advertised, and hasn't broken yet. It just &#34;feels&#34; like it's cheap. Definitely for the younger fans of Doctor Who. Older fans probably won't like this. Ages 12 and down IMO.<br /><br />It arrived fast which was good though.
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|Film almost seemed silly and couldn't decide on what type of film it should be. Original story, comedy, love story. 1920's viewed through today lens.
B00DK9FNLY|1.0|I agree with Mr. Reese that the permissions and adware potential for this game are simply unnecessary. Unless you absolutely MUST play a rather blah table tennis game, they're just not worth adding this app to your tablet or phone.<br /><br />The physics of the game are not sound. On the one hand it sometimes \\"cheats\\" to curve your ball back onto the table to keep it in play, but that doesn't really matter because even in novice mode it is very rare for the opponent to miss returning your shot. This game gave me zero feeling of playing real table tennis.<br /><br />I don't know if some people have better \\"tablet skills\\" than me, but some of these games where you need to use a finger instead of a stylus cause me to use too much pressure against the screen, eventually causing soreness in a knuckle. This was one of those games. Even if I liked the game, I wouldn't be able to play it for that reason.<br /><br />I'll confirm that you can't save a game and return later ... leaving the game screen is a loss. At least unlike the previous FAotD, this game WILL let you out of the game through it's menus, even if that is a multi-step process.<br /><br />I also experienced a bug in the game where the player's paddle sometimes jumps to the net and stays there. Eventually it would move back to its normal area, but a few points were lost before it did.<br /><br />The game could use a tutorial and give the player more prospects to win points. If you try this and don't continually get run off the table by this game I'd love to hear what your technique is to win more points.<br /><br />I don't think this is a game you're likely to stay interested in for long at all.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Well written.  It's as if G. R,R. Martin came from the era of Knights and Kings.  Nothing is left to speculation as he covers everything to the minute detail.  Reading his books gives you the sense of being a part of the story.
B00ESF2772|5.0|Best Dr. Seuss book!!! Lots of tongue twisters in it. A child has to concentrate to read it. I purchased it for myself (I am an adult) because I love it so much. I look for the opportunities to share it with a child.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I am thankful that I learned a out this great little book while visiting my grandchildren.  I am thankful that they were asked to read it, that they recommended it to their mother, and she recommended it to me.  I will recommend it to my friends(of all ages) because it has much to teach us all.
B003K1EYM6|4.0|and transfer pics from my camera directly to my Ipad. The SD card adapter works perfectly like most other Apple products is high quality and also fits easily inside my camera bag. I recommend this item and the seller!
0714845183|5.0|Although my girlfriend accuses me of getting the book because of the beautiful (near) naked women portrayed, I bought it for her. I am more interested in Impressionism than the Pre-Raphaelites, than she is. They are beautiful though and the book is an excellent overview of Waterhouse's work. My favorite? The lady in the (modestly attired) red dress with the crystal.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|It keeps kicking off every time I go on search butt it let me do it a lot before and the new update for it is really good because it shows you all the videos of what you search so in other words really good butt can get frustrating!
B00BQ1DBUS|3.0|Not as good as I thought it would be. I am a little disapointed.I expected more guess I am just picky.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|And I definitely felt it. This book is the best book I have possibly ever had the privilege of reading. John Green has done it again with this completely wonderful and agonising tale of live and cancer. You will feel it like you are actually Hazel Grace. That's the thing about pain. It demands to be felt.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is the first television series that I can actually say I never want to miss; the writing is first rate with a combination of wit, intrigue, and manipulation that make it truly enjoyable.  Not just for fans of the legal profession, this has enough drama and real world issues to make it a hit for almost anyone.
B007UWBQEU|4.0|Have all ways liked her work. Has she ever did a bad record? She keeps getting stronger as time goes on
B003Z0BWT0|4.0|I just loved reading about the city of Alicante. My imagination definitely went wild. I would love to visit this imaginary city. Really enjoyed discovering this history of Clary's family...and Jace!
B004TI5N38|4.0|This was a interesting story, but too many IDs by letters. The different agencies involved made you wonder who is in charge.
B003Z0BWR2|4.0|Loved the second book as much as the first. Hanging on...waiting to find out about Clary and Jace. This series is different to anything I've read before :)
B009C7ZQM4|3.0|First of all this app is great but when you find the app on there and you press unistall and you think it unistall but it actually doesent that's the only thing I don't like about this app.
B003Z0BWRM|4.0|Who doesn't love a book about forbidden love, longing and families! Really enjoyed the different spin on vampires, werewolves and other night creatures! Bring on none next one :)
B00EEDNA4M|4.0|I have to take a star off my rating for the packaging of this excellent show.  The disks really shoud come in a white &#34;corpse-disposal&#34; barrel instead of the black &#34;buried-cash&#34; barrel.  If a collectors' variant set is later offered, I will revise my rating.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Good drama and character development. I am obsessed with this show- all 4 seasons. It is definitely one of my favorites. :)
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book follows the stories of families in transition with all the emotional problems this can create. Each woman including Rachel discovered her ability to grow and change when her life pushed her to do so. Ms Moriarty moved the story and characters through intensely difficult situations with truth an descriptive honesty. These people could be my friends,neighbors, families or me. I recognized the thinking that needs to happen when problems arise and a family's future is at stake. Well done!
B00E8TVHBA|5.0|i loved this movie so much! it was cute and funny and i loved all the songs! i own the movie and the soundtrack :)
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Poorly written, but at least this one had a plot.  The sex was the best part. Not all my questions were answered.
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|This a great action film full of funny moments. Good one for the family. The kids and the adults will enjoy it.
B00CUG8GAS|4.0|Graphic memoir of family life in Southern Africa. While I disliked and disagreed with their politics I could not help but admire their courage.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I think this is a great app to have! Anything you want for an app is on this one! Loving it. Finally merp.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Plot a bit simplistic and formulaic but  good escape read. Lee Child's book is not overly demanding of the reader.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|This was better than I had expected. Just enough scare factor along with some good special effects. One I will buy & watch again.
B00DV3A84G|5.0|After getting to know them through their hit single 'Pompeii', I immediately got struck by how fresh and honest this band sounds. All of the songs in this album are absolutely amazing, I couldn't skip a single track and that doesn't happen very often to me. Dan's voice is ethereal and beautiful, astoundingly backed by Kyle's keyboard and synths, Will's bass and Woody's drums. Together they make an amazing menagerie of sounds. After seeing them on the iTunes Festival on 2012 (and again on 2013) my love for them grew stronger and now they have placed themselves as one of my top 5 bands.<br />If you are having doubts on buying this record, SKIP THOSE and do it, because you won't be able to skip any of their songs.
B00BAYLRNO|5.0|An inspiring movie of hope & courage. Brought back memories of that horrific day. Made me cry just enough but a wonderful movie of love & courage.
B003Y5H5FG|4.0|I liked it, it was not as good as the original but it was a good movie. Or maybe I was in the mood for a scary movie, either way I say watch this it an ok movie. Not hard to follow plot, rather simple.
B00ADS98FC|4.0|Fun little movie for a girls' night. Clever mashups and great vocal talent.  Glee lovers will enjoy this movie for sure.
B00992CF6W|5.0|u should totally buy. worth every cent. should be called best game evah! survival is the best part. if u like this buy computer version.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Who does not love a Star Trek movie?  I have loved Star Trek since I was a kid!  Go Spock!!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Works beautifully just as you would enjoy on your computer, so I would recommend I've had no problems thus far.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Good representation of the inner workings of New York Corporate Lawyers.<br />Look forward to seeing Season 2 of Suits. Have fun watching.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|A great script with great actors equal perfect show. It's a perfect assembly of writing, acting, and directing. Can't complain.
B005LAII6C|4.0|ParaNorman is a good movie it looks almost like the movie Coraline  but with zombies I bought both Films Coraline and ParaNorman  for my niece and nephew They liked it A lot.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|I love this game. Fast paced and challenging.had it on my pc before but didn't want to buy it again.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|Love the movie and I would recommend it to everyone! It has a great set of actors and great storyline!
B0042TV4IW|4.0|Lark Rise to Canleford<br />It is clean entertainment and good development of the characters.  Enjoyable and I would recommend it
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I love this series it is the best I have read in a long time! The drama of trying to figure out what Valentine has in mind for the world and his children. Also trying to figure out if Jace is working with his father or if he is being set up to look like he is. For me the best part was when Jace and Clary kiss because it is what her heart most desires! I have to say so would mine. But you realize that they both have feeling for each other despite it all.
B008QZ1ZYQ|4.0|Really cool game. Makes u think. Very challenging. Love it.kind of hard for younger players. Cant wait to play it again.
B001NLL93W|5.0|So in this book Jace is trying to leave Clary at home instead of taking her with them to Idris to see the Clave. At first it's not clear why he is doing this and it makes Clary and you as the reader very upset, but when you find out the reason it's kind of sweet. You meet Clary's real brother and you find out that Clary and Jace are not really brother and sister. I'm in love
0307744434|1.0|The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern is the story of two young magicians Marco and Celia who by fate or design are put against each other in a battle where if you win you live and if you lose you die.  They have been trained their whole life for the ultimate test of magic and illusion and the circus is their stage.<br /><br />The destiny dictated to them is tested when will and love get in the way.  The book is full of wonderful imagery and I am looking forward to the movie because I want the Night Circus and all it's splendor to come to life on the big screen; however, the story was disappointing to say the least.  The plot revolved around this battle, but unless I missed it, the author never explained why there was a battle. The romance was also disappointing. There was very little of it and when it happened it was rushed and abrupt. One moment they are kissing for the first time and in the next chapters he is in love.  I connected so little with the main characters that I didn't really care if they ended up together or who won the battle.<br /><br />The book had too many supporting characters that it was hard for me to keep up with all the other stories. It didn't help that they all seemed to be out of sequence. The lack of chronological order,  confused the heck out of me. I lost track of when things happened and at the end I just wanted it to end.<br /><br />Yes imagery was wonderful, but the story not so much. I give this book one kiss.
B002GYI96U|5.0|Very interesting story! Very well written story. Well developed. Great characters. Lots of twists and turns. Happy moments, gravely sad moments.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Great and simple to use, just 3 easy steps!! A must download for HP printer owners! Love it for Pinterest!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is cool it is much fun the minions are funny they are so cool love this game so much
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We have been following this since season one, we are hoping season 4 to start soon. This period piece is done so well, it is almost a history lesson.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Love this book, couldn't put it down. Typical Jack Reacher just like I hoped. I highly recommend it, it kept my attention and wanting more. Hated for it to end,
B00B9366VO|5.0|A peek into the Los Angeles music scene with delicious inside glimpses of how seminal rock bands such as Fleetwood Mac, Neil Young, Tom Petty got their start or furthered their careers with the help of this amazing sound studio and it's exceptional analog sound board. Musicians flocked to this venue to capture the essence of their musical souls until the advent of the digital revolution rendering the Sound City less relevant to the recording process. Happily Dave Grohl saved the star of the show when he purchased the famous sound board from the bankrupt old studio. Anyone who loves rock and the creative genius involved in the capturing of the great performances should treat themselves to this gem.
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|Bruce Springsteen and the E-Street Band represent a force of nature that challenges, inspires, and shows us how to celebrate the beauty and the joy of life.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|If you love Sci Fi this movie is amazing exactly how a Sci Fi movie should be one of the best Sci Fi movies in a while. Cannot wait to see the special edition. Just watch it you will love it to all the Tom Cruise haters just because you do not like him you cannot say the movie sucks because he is in it actually he done a fine job in this movie but even if you do not like him movie is awesome. Hollywood should do more movies like that. PS the bad part nearly no nudity or sex at all.
B00EQRMAJW|3.0|I put this album on and gave it a solid listen and it's just okay for me. Nothing special. All of the songs kind of sound the same but the lyrics, the production, his delivery are all what you'd expect from Mr. Legend, I was just hoping for something more or different or just something more vibrant. This album is kind of stagnant but if you are a fan of good R&B, you can't go wrong with a Legend song.
B001XUJMZK|5.0|The movie, Braveheart, portrays the livinag conditions in England and Scotland during this period of history in a truthful manner and the fight of serfdom Scotland from tyranical England in a proper light. Great writing and acting throughout the film. I will watch it and enjoy this movie, every few years or sol
B00F875N98|5.0|As if I expected them to do anything other than create a great album. I purchased this a day after it released and couldn't listen to it til the next day and when I did, that feeling I get when I listen to Caleb's voice, happened all over again.<br /><br />SUPERSOAKER is fun and a great way to open the album. ROCK CITY makes me forget I'm singing a song. DON'T MATTER had to grow on me (there is always one that does) but now that it has it flows with me, BEAUTIFUL WAR is a wonderful song, it opens up with truth from the first to the last word, TEMPLE is great reminds me of the 80's, I feel happy when it comes on. WAIT FOR ME starts off with that great opener that you can only get from a KOL album, FAMILY TREE is a solid rock song, COMEBACK STORY is Brilliance in music. There is always a few KOL songs that make me cry or feel some kind of way and this is one of them. The lyrics, the passion in Calebs voice, the production, it's brilliant and every time I listen to it, I drift off into a place where only music can take me, TONIGHT is the other song that gets to me deeply. I am so happy these were placed right after each other because when I repeat one, the other tags along. The lyrics are perfect, absolutely perfect. Sometimes I think when they are writing songs, that they are right up in my head. ON THE CHIN closes the album out nicely. It's soft, like a melody, it's sweet and charming. It's a KOL.<br /><br />If you are a fan like I am and you know all of their music, have accepted all of their albums and it's differences, then you will LOVE, LOVE this album. Get It . . . listen and fall into that place that only KOL can take you.<br />KUDOS
B005XQLBU4|3.0|The game is okay as a diversion from life which can be enjoyed while waiting at the doctors or while the wife is out shopping about town.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|As I expected.  Huge fan.  Just keeps getting better.  Generally I am not a watcher of sit coms, but the Big Bang Theory surpasses anything airing on TV today.  Highly recommend.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|After I finished watching it, I wondered why I had. Brad Pitt maybe? I am usually easy to please. I watch for enjoyment. But this movie gave me none. In my opinion, someone floated the idea of zombies who can out run an Olympic 100 yard sprinter. Okay, that's okay. But usually zombies are slow menacing things with gruesome bodies and faces. What I am getting at is that the zombies of WWZ were a blur. I know this will sound odd, but they had no character. Except for one or two faces shown up close, the rest were running so fast became cyphers, nothing. In the very last fourth of the movie they take on some slow moving qualities, especially when Pitt has to get something from a laboratory. But other than that, this was a one trick dog and pony show that left me thinking that I could have watched the Walking Dead, instead.
B00C7L8DM2|4.0|Whole different story line than I was expecting. Excellent story line and acting was in the same category. Would definitely watch again.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved it. Great story, well written, kept me up late reading. I'll be looking for more by this author.
B00COGXGNQ|3.0|Not a bad flick by any means of the imagination. Story line falls very credible, and the acting was superb.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Absolutely love this show. I couldn't stop watching. So in love Mike and Harvey's characters. I used to work in the building they &#34;work&#34; in.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Brad Pitt was very crediable in this movie. The story line was very up to date with world events and overall I'd definitely watch again.
B0070ZLZ1G|2.0|I am a teacher, so I was very eager to read this book. I really liked the beginning of the book when the writer actually talks about what the cover says he is going to write about &#34;grit, curiosity, character.&#34;  I was curious to find out what the character qualities are that make a person successful. It was fascinating to read that conscientiousness is a character successful people have, which is the same quality that my bosses have used to describe me, but which I never really appreciated or fully understood. It was nice to learn something about myself. Also, the studies on stressful childhoods and success were fascinating. The research on people who pass their GED but don't succeed were equally fascinating.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the book is all down hill after the first 1/4 of the book. The author actually doesn't delve very deeply into the characteristics. I don't even recall him talking about curiosity, even though it's on the cover. He writes and writes and writes about the high school chess champions, whose skills do not transfer to school work or success in life, so I'm not sure why he's writing about them. Also, I've read a lot about these chess players before, so it was nothing new.<br /><br />He also brings up topics but doesn't finish them like the wealthy school on the East Coast and their program of instilling character into their students. He doesn't finish the story or tell us the results. It would have been better if he had not focused so much on one socio-economic group (low income) but on a variety of groups (low, middle, and high).<br /><br />I feel that this book was written by someone who isn't very knowledgeable about the subject.<br /><br />Furthermore, I wish he would have actually talked to the students themselves rather than only the teachers and administration and researchers. I think only in one or two cases did he give us the student's voice, but for the most part we never get to find out what the students think of Kip or Teach for America or these character building programs.<br /><br />This would have been a better book if the author had actually tried to be a teacher himself for awhile. He gives so much free press to Kip and Teach for America. I am sure they would give him a teaching job in a second. Also, the writer probably would have more credibility if he had actually not dropped out of college and had a background in education.<br /><br />Save your money and don't buy this book. Wait until a better book on the same subject comes out.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|Enjoyed the twist on this traditional story and done with taste. Was very mildly surprised! Would watch it one more time.
B00CIVLZ3U|5.0|As all of Brandon's books, it is surprising, well written and makes perfect sense.<br /><br />I recommend every one to read this book!
B004FP1WX0|4.0|Have you ever wondered how a change encounter or a long distance relationship would work out, you'll enjoy this one.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This season was awesome and I was so sad and could not believe the season finale.  I was so upset!!!!  Please let January get here fast, because I need more Downton Abby!!
B00EY8BRGU|2.0|I don't know what people are on to think this movie was any good. No charachter building, poorly acted, shallow relationships, vauge plot. The only good thing about this movie was Woody Harrelson, and he didn't get enough screen time. What a waste of talented actors! I couldn't help thinking, How could any of you have read this script and then still agreed to be in it? I didn't want to say how bad it sucked out loud in case my husband was enjoying it, until he started laughing during one of the parts where we were supposed to be \\"moved.\\" What a relief! I thought he had lost all ability to identify a decent movie!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The excitement just keeps getting better.  The characters make me want to come back to see just how they will get through their next problem.
0316228583|5.0|I grew up with Harry Potter as well - Jo taught me English, taught me storytelling, inspired me to start writing. The thing I loved most about Harry Potter was that it wasn't really a children's story. There was a fog of fantasy and lightheartedness, but neither did Jo ever hold back on showing everyone how dark life can get. Harry Potter was a dark children's story.<br /><br />This is not a children's story. This is Jo bringing out everything she's seen of life; the dreary parts, the funny parts, the awkward parts - and then the dark parts, the depressing parts, and the worst parts of humanity. This is Jo not holding back anything at all. The eloquence of language, the colorful characters - I needed a character map just to remind myself who was related to who because every chapter gave you a different view of the characters; so different that I often forgot they were the same person, despite them having the same names. Villains are heroes in their own stories, and heroes are villains in other people's narratives. She addresses drug addiction, poverty, classism, sexism, racism, prejudice, life and death.<br /><br />If you spent your childhood with Harry Potter, I suggest you read this book. This is you growing up.
B000RO9VJK|5.0|I understand more why I failed in small buseness before, and feel empowered to try again, its is power info
B00EP0KBXM|2.0|Very much a sci-fi person, watch as much as I can get....<br />I watched this with an open mind, however it just fell short in so many ways.<br />No as bad as a SyFy channel B movie, that's really saying much.<br />It's worth seeing, watch while your mowing the lawn or something....
B00F91H666|4.0|World War Z is an entertaining movie with a different take on zombies. The bottom line is it is worth the rental, so go ahead an watch it. Brad Pit does a great job playing his part, as usual.  There are some aspects of the story line they could have made better, but rarely do we find a movie perfectly written to our liking. These Zombies are the fastest zombie every created for a movie.
B001GLYMK6|1.0|I decided to watch this movie because it is a remake of a cute and touching Korean romantic comedy that I really enjoyed watching. The remake was a major disappointment, it captured nothing of the complexity of the characters in the Korean original and failed to depict any chemistry between the two main characters. The sassy girl in the Korean version is a complex character, who despite being absolutely sassy and at times mean is at the same time lovely, adorable and vulnerable. Elisha Cuthbert, however, does not bring any of this complexity to the role, the character she depicts is not much more than simply annoying. A full review would give too much away of the plot for people who have not seen the movie, but in short it is safe to say that this remake falls flat, and that it is recommended to watch the Korean original instead.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|The team is at its best.  Great plot lines.  The characters are all superb!  Even though I hate Dinozzo! LOL.
B000H4TX9I|4.0|must watch for all.  starts off very slow but gets really good really fast.  watch it and you'll love it
0739352687|4.0|It was great to hear it read by one person using many voices.<br />That is also part of the problem... sometimes the character voice or accent would slip and change from book to book.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This game is very addicting and funn. Great for kids with spare time. Although I don't like that the acorns are so hard to get without having to buy them. You need them for some of the most important challenges. Other than that I love it!
B00364K6YW|5.0|I like good clean movies (or as clean as you can get nowadays). Most people would skip movies like that because they think they are too predictable or \\"lame\\", but I love them because I know I will be watching something that won't make me feel like I have just been \\"slimed\\". Pride and Prejudice was really quite clean. There are a few utterances of mild obscenity.  I can't remember if anyone is shown drinking wine.  There is no violence or nudity, but there are several low cut dresses.  It is also said that a girl of 15 runs away with a man she is not married to and are living together.  You see them together later in a room in London talking to each other and she is sitting on the bed. (They are later made to marry).  It is also said later that the same man tried to run away with another  15 year old girl, but her brother prevented it. The same man is seen with a woman in a corset and a long skirt, sitting on his lap for a few seconds and it is mentioned that he has gamboling debts.<br /><br />This is a story about Elizabeth Bennet and her family.  Elizabeth is 20 years old and is intelligent, lively, attractive and witty; however, she has a tendency to judge on first impression.  She is her father's favorite, very close to her elder sister Jane, and embarrassed by her mother and three youngest sisters displays in public.<br /><br />Her father, is a gentleman of modest income with five unmarried daughters, and therefore, his property can only pass to a male heir (their cousin, Mr. Collins), leaving his wife and daughters on their own when he dies.  His wife, Mrs. Bennet, is frivolous, excitable, and narrow-minded, and she imagines herself susceptible to attacks of tremors and palpitations. Her public manners and social climbing are embarrassing to Jane and Elizabeth. Her favorite daughter is the youngest, Lydia, who reminds her of herself when younger, though she values the beauty of the eldest, Jane. Her main ambition in life is to marry her daughters to wealthy men.<br /><br />The eldest daughter, Jane, is a sweet, shy and sensible, girl, but not as clever as Elizabeth.  She also only sees the good in others.  She falls in love with the rich Mr. Bingley, who moves to their neighborhood, and he falls in love with her.  However, his sisters and his closest friend, Mr. Darcy, think the Bennet's beneath them, because they have no wealth or connections.  Mr Darcy, aided by Elizabeth, eventually sees the error in his ways and is instrumental in bringing Jane and Bingley back together.<br /><br />Mary is the only plain Bennet sister.  She mostly reads and practices music, and thinks herself very wise and so tries to counsel the family.  Like her two younger sisters, Kitty and Lydia, she is seen as being silly by Mr Bennet.<br /><br />Kitty is the second youngest daughter, and the shadow of her younger sister, Lydia.  She always laughs or makes fun of whatever Lyida does and follows in her pursuits of the 'Officers' of the regiment.  She seems envious of what Lydia is allowed to do or have, and her father thinks her \\"silly\\".<br /><br />Lydia is the youngest and only 15.  She is spoiled, frivolous and headstrong, mostly because her mother never denies her and her father ignores her actions.  Her main enjoyment is socializing, especially flirting with the officers of the militia. Eventually, this leads to her elopement with George Wickham. Lydia shows no regard for the moral code of her society, and no remorse for the disgrace she causes her family. She is the first Bennet sister to marry, thanks to the help of Mr. Darcy being the one to discover them and paying to make their marriage happen.<br /><br />When Elizabeth's cousin, Mr. Collins (a clergyman), comes to visit to try and bridge the gap between their families (caused by him inheriting the estate instead of them) the family quickly learns that his plan is to marry one of the Bennet daughters. After being told by Mrs. Bennet that it is supposed that Jane will very soon be engaged, he turns all his attentions on Elizabeth.  Elizabeth finds him pompous, and lacking in common sense, and so rejects his marriage proposal.  Her father supports her in this (even though it would have benefited the family financially).  Mr. Collins then marries Elizabeth's friend, Charlotte Lucas, even though Charlotte doesn't love him.<br /><br />As the movie progresses, Elizabeth despises Mr. Darcy more and more.  He is handsome, tall, and intelligent, but rather antisocial; therefore, causing most to think him proud.  But by those that know him well, he is a trusted and true friend.  However, Elizabeth, falling for Wickham's charm and flattery, believes the stories he tells about how Darcy has wronged him.  She also finds out that Darcy was partly responsible for separating Jane and Mr. Bingley.  Therefore, when Darcy proposes to Elizabeth, telling her that by marrying her it would mean ignoring her rank, family and fortune and going against his families wishes and his \\"own better judgement\\" - she puts him in his place and tells him that because of his conceit, his arrogance, and his selfish disdain for the feelings of others, nothing could possibly have ever tempted her to accept him.<br /><br />Darcy and Elizabeth are forced to be in each other's company, causing both to see the other in a different light.  Not being able to get over the love he feels for Elizabeth and wanting her to have a better opinion of him, he tells her the truth about his dealings with Wickham and when he learns of Wickham running away with Elizabeth's sister, he does every thing in his power to fix the situation, so the family won't be \\"ruined\\" by the disgrace.  At the end, both overcome their differences (Darcy's pride and Elizabeth's prejudice) and judgments to fall in love with each other.  She realizes that she was wrong to judge him so quickly and he realized that he was brought up with correct principles, but was left to follow them in pride and conceit, and he would be still, itit weren't for Elizabeth.<br /><br />Overall, I love this movie and will definitely be watching it again and again.
B00ARF93AQ|5.0|What a great movie! The pace of the action is non-stop and the slow motion scenes are amazing. A must watch! The blu ray picture is sharp!
B000HEWEE4|5.0|I like good clean movies (or as clean as you can get nowadays). Most people would skip movies like that because they think it is too predictable or \\"lame\\", but I love them because I know I will be watching something that won't make me feel like I have just been \\"slimed\\". The Lake House was really quite clean.<br /><br />The only sexual scenes in the movie are when a man and a woman kiss passionately and hug; a man and a woman dance closely together and kiss (the woman's boyfriend interrupts them); and there are several other scenes where a man and a woman kiss.  There are also a few low-cut tops and dresses that reveal cleavage and once a woman's nightgown is sheer and the outline of her legs is visible when she stands in front of a window.<br /><br />The only violence is when a man is struck by a bus and a car is struck by the same bus (you only see the man lying still on the ground and hear later that he died); a man is in a hospital after having had a heart attack (you don't witness it); a man cries after learning of the death of his father; a woman describes the plot of a book that includes a short description of a husband breaking his wife's neck with an ax (she says it with an accent, and so it is kind of hard to understand).  There are a few utterances of mild obscenity and a few scenes where people drink alcohol in a bar.<br /><br />The movie is about Kate Forster, a lonely doctor living in the year 2006, who moves from an unusual lakeside home to Chicago. After witnessing a man being hit by a bus, and upset that she can't save him and that his life ended so suddently, she takes the advice of a co-worker and goes back to the lake house, where she felt most like herself.  Through the mail box, she begins exchanging love letters with the lake house's former resident, Alex Wyler, a frustrated architect living two years in the past.  In 2004 (his time) his path crosses hers unexpectedly, but he is afraid to say anything to her, for fear that she would think himcrazy. In 2006 (her time) they decide to meet, but he never shows up.  Thinking that she let get lost in this dream, and that they were too late to make it work, she tells him to let her let him go. Apparently fate has a different idea, and once again, with the help of the magic mailbox to the past, she has a chance to change the future and bring them both together at last.<br /><br />Overall, I really loved the movie. Actually, it is one of my favorite movies.  In know the whole idea of a mail box that connects the past and the future together is a little unbelievable, but since when are movies supposed to be completely believable.  I enjoyed the movie for the simple fact that it was a great love story.  They did a really good job, and I for one will continue to watch this show over and over again.
B0013KTGAG|4.0|This is a great movie. It was surprisingly suspenseful, thought provoking, and dramatic. I did find myself feeling for the characters and their situation. This movie is definitley worth watching.
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|Very let down by the amount of loss in this season. Why would a person watch a show if all if does is make you depressed, one episode after another?
B004ADH1RI|5.0|I enjoyed it ! !  I think the movie people should make more movies like this one. THE GOONIES is a good, clean movie.

B00AVPYT8I|5.0|I love it and have downloaded a few really good books.  I recommend it to anyone. So you should check it out!
1451683405|5.0|Don't be fooled by the length of this book, it packs a riveting punch.  Think about everything you know about yourself: the choices you've made in life, your feelings and notions, even your mood, and then throw it all away. Sam Harris' bold monograph facilitates this very notion with cogent language, opening your eyes to the nebulas realm of unconsciousness, decision-making, efforts, and intentions. This review is meant to evaluate Free Will and convince you that this book is worthwhile to read. That is, if you are ready to hear what Dr. Harris has to say.<br /> Probably the most impressive aspect of this book is its ability to capture the difficult concept of free will, and articulate it with such finesse that the mundane individual can grasp its meaning. In fact, Free Will's main objective is to destroy this idea of autonomy that has been ingrained in basic human culture. The question of free will \\"touches nearly everything we care about\\". The subject of this book is so relevant that according to the author, \\"if the scientific community were to declare free will an illusion, it would precipitate a culture war far more belligerent than the one that has been waged on the subject of evolution\\".<br /> Free Will's concise structure makes this book encouraging to read, despite its controversial material. With a degree in philosophy from Stanford University, and a Ph.D. in neuroscience, Dr. Harris is well equipped to enlighten us on such a challenging topic. The book is divided into eight thought out chapters that does a good job of first establishing the relevancy of its subject and then systematically breaking down the \\"illusion\\" of free will by attacking it from various angles. Here I have a brief description and opinion on some of the important parts of the book:<br /><br />Introduction<br />Free Will's introduction is unsurprisingly brave and captivating. He acknowledges that the claims he makes will undoubtedly receive criticism, and that most people will \\"find hisconclusions abhorrent\\". So, in order to allure his skeptical audience on such a contentious topic, Dr. Harris uses an equally controversial example on how free will is just an illusion: the Cheshire murders of the Petit family.  If you are an individual with a weak stomach, vivid imagination, and sensitive heart, I advise you skip over this part of the book. He is defending the criminals involved in Cheshire murders who were also convicted of rape and abuse. He strives to reduce these acts of blatant horror and moral disregard to products of uncontrollable experience combined with plain neurological mechanisms. Essentially, Dr. Harris says that the murder and rape of Dr. William Petit's wife and two young daughters was not their fault. If this is not enough to catch your attention, I would question your sense of basic human empathy.<br /><br />Ch. 1-The Unconscious Origins of the Will<br />Free will is an illusion. This idea is repeated to the reader consistently throughout the book and is the central point that the author strives to drive home. How Dr. Harris relays this idea and tries to disabuse us of a concept that has been so instilled in our mentality is remarkable. Using examples relatable in everyday situations, he intelligibly picks apart our idea that we actually have a freedom of choice. He says, \\"Our sense of free will results from a failure to understand this: We do not know what we intend to do until the intention itself arises\\". Where does this intention originate? Dr. Harris claims it comes from our unconsciousness and bolsters his claim with some solid experimental evidence. He boldly states that scientists can have the ability to know what you're about to do seconds before you actually do it. Basically, scientists can read your mind. Read to find out the revealing nature of this evidence.<br /><br />Ch. 2-Changing the Subject<br />In this chapter, Dr. Harris switches gears and gives respect to the cohorts out there dedicated to this debate of freewill. He mentions the three major philosophical approaches to this issue: determinism, libertarianism, and compatibilism. I appreciate this chapter because for a moment, Dr. Harris separates himself from his personal opinion on the matter, and gives respect to the contending opinions as well. Though later on in his essay, Dr. Harris debunks these philosophies, he gives the reader an opportunity to understand the different opinions on the matter and form his own stance with object descriptions for each branch.<br /><br />Ch. 3-Cause and Effect<br />This is perhaps the most scientific portion of the book. \\"In physical terms, we know that every human action can be reduced to a series of impersonal events: Genes are transcribed, neurotransmitters bind to their receptors, muscle fibers contract, and John Doe pulls the trigger on his gun.\\" What does Dr. Harris describe here exactly? Did he just attribute a seemingly immoral act to plain products of physical mechanisms? Does he believe that the injustice in John Doe's acts lies not in his punitive outcome from the legal system but actually in the nature of the legal system itself? Does Mr. Doe deserve a punishment, or does Dr. Harris infer that if anyone (or anything) were to blame, it would be the simple, impersonal neurological mechanisms in the brain that were not in John's control? Read to find out how the author intriguingly develops his argument.<br /><br />Ch. 5-Might the Truth Be Bad for Us?<br />My favorite part of the book involves the author defending how destroying our current idea of free will will not negatively affect the way humans progress through life. In a sense, this is also the most important aspect of the book, for if free will were a necessary illusion, our revilement to it will direct us towards a wrongful path. \\"Many people worry that free will is a necessary illusion-and that without it we will fail to live creative and fulfilling lives...One study found that having subjects read an argument against free will made them more likely to cheat on a subsequent exam. Another found such subjects to be less helpful and more aggressive.\\" It is apparent that a world without free will is like a guilt-free pass into wrongful doings, but Dr. Harris maintains his stance that our exposure to the \\"truth\\" will not be harmful. \\"It is surely conceivable that knowing certain truths about he human mind could have unfortunate psychological and/or cultural consequences. However, I am not worried about degrading the morality of my readers by publishing this book.\\" Actually, he boasts that losing the sense of free will has only boosted his ethics and increased his feelings of compassion and forgiveness, and diminished his sense of entitlement to \\"the fruits of [his] own good luck.\\" How does this make sense? Read the books to learn his clear and logical thought process.<br /><br />The rest of the book is dedicated to our moral responsibility given this convincing argument Dr. Harris lays out on the table, touching on politics, law, religion, public policy, and much more. If you have a few hours to spend, and are feeling intellectually adventurous, I recommend this book. I cannot think of another book so concise, yet so powerful. Beware that the topic discussed in this book is not one for light reading, but one for thought provoking. Read it with an open mind and you will absorb a unique perspective on human nature articulated nicely by a bright scientist well suited for such a topic.
0307155102|4.0|I have mixed feelings about this book because although the pictures are fun and detailed, it isn't really the Busy Town book I was looking for.  This book is huge in terms of cover size (10.5\\" x 12\\") and in terms of length (71 pages).  It seems that every single thing in the world has been cataloged and pictured in this book! Categories include \\"at the supermarket\\", \\"getting dressed\\", \\"at school\\", \\"cars and trucks\\" and basically everything a child would encounter except maybe modern things like computers. The sheer number of pictures is amazing and they're all in that cute Richard Scarry style.<br /><br />However, I specifically bought this book because my preschooler loves [[ASIN:0307168034 Richard Scarry's Busy, Busy Town]]. Unfortunately this book is both too similar and too dissimilar to \\"Busy, Busy Town\\". The main thing is that my child's favorite characters Huckle and Lowly are not in this book. I think that with an original publication date of 1963, this book must predate Busy Town and those two characters.  The second problem is that \\"Busy, Busy Town\\" recycles way too much material from \\"Best World Book Ever\\".  (I know this problem mainly lies with \\"Busy, Busy Town\\", which was published posthumously.) After browsing some other Busy Town books in the bookstore, I see that many of the books repeat material in this way. However, the illustrations aren't reprinted, they're totally redrawn, so it's not like the pages are exactly the same.<br /><br />I think this would be a good first Busy Town book, but not if your child is specifically looking for Huckle and Lowly.
B000XXTCF8|4.0|Nice collection. Very typical. No surprised either good or bad. Brown eyed girl and noncancerous are essentials for any collection.
B002U3CCF6|4.0|Good read - very explicit, hard to put down. Great characters. Lots of twists and psychological twists. Recommend to others.
B00F5BON8O|4.0|Another outstanding release from Sarah Jarosz.  Only stopping at 4 stars because she's so young and want to keep her motivated.<br /><br />I hesitate to say this third studio album is &#34;more of the same&#34; but suffice it to say her existing fans will not be disappointed.  New music from someone with Sarah's talents (to say nothing of the exceptional work Nate and Alex) is always a welcome addition to my cloud.<br /><br />PS Do yourself a favor and catch then live on their current tour.
B0095NCXKI|5.0|I love this show sooooo much!!!!!!! It is funny and just a fun thing to look forward to watching!!!!!! :)

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like subway suffer because it's fun and it feels like your free to do anything u won't. And it's like funny at the same time because the police  is so fat he looks like a donut lol and I hop  the make subway suffers in Trinidad
B00F4KCD24|5.0|An amazing second chapter to his album &#34;The Soul Cages&#34;. He takes you on a journey and paints a vivid picture. A beautiful album. I can just picture it on the stage.

B00594XOZU|1.0|i used to be able to say that kik was 5 stars but now kik won't let me log in which stinks so i hope they fix that because it is just ridiculous i have seen that other people have commented the same thing , i try to log in and it says loading for a while and then it says &quot;this is taking longer than it should , try again in a bit and I've tried EVERYTHING to get my kik back but it's just something the editors will have to fix (i also have tried making a new account but it also says the same stupid thing)
B00B52FDXQ|5.0|Great packaging and disc quality. An epic final season to one of the best tv shows ever to air. Highly recommend.
B000002LK1|5.0|This is the perfect album for DM fans.  It brings back nostalgic memories and it wonderful to have in my collection once again.
B00FFEM0W2|5.0|Great packaging and great quality discs. The video quality is stunning as is expected from blu ray. The series itself got a bad rap but I think that the story arc that developed starting in season 2 made for great tv. It ended prematurely in my opinion. Looking forward to season 3.
B00CL0J99K|2.0|The special effects are spectacular. The photography is good.  The acting is decent.  But the story is just not interesting at all.  Why spend so much money on production values and not spend a little more to hire scriptwriters with talent?
1400034779|5.0|This delightful series made my summer shine even brighter! I fell in love with the characters, the setting, and McCall Smith's wonderful use of the English language. In one delicious package, he gives us mystery, humor, love story, and fascinating cultural insight.<br /><br />The author is so talented that he seems unable to create a forgettable character. He does this so well that for me, it's almost impossible to believe that these people and their stories don't actually exist! This total suspension of disbelief has happened to me only once before-- in the Harry Potter books. I really didn't expect for it to happen again.<br /><br />He also has an uncanny understanding of the female psyche -- that's very unusual for a man.<br /><br />But his stories are more than just chick lit.  My husband was the first to discover this series. In record time, he inhaled the first 14 books!<br /><br />We also rented the BBC adaptations -- five stars for that, too!<br /><br />Mr. Smith, we are smitten with your work. Keep on writing, OK?
B008EKMB82|3.0|Enjoyed the book, especially the splitting of time & location. Nice insight into an American / Japanese perspective & the culture clash. Maybe I'll try sitting Zazen.
B00CPTUN5G|5.0|Cute Colorful and well done.  Both my two year old and 7 year old loved this movie.  They watched it over and over again and loved that it came with a printable poster they hold up and play with just like a movie poster.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|Pretty good movie if for nothing else the special effects.  It was pretty amazing how they filmed the tiger with the boy!  Not a great movie, IMO, but watchable, with great photography.
B00F91SCXC|3.0|What it is:<br />* entertaininig<br />* great makeup and zombie action<br />* believable story line<br /><br />What it missed:<br />* a good staff (outside of Brat)<br />* a great story line that evolves or didn't lag<br />* leaves you with a sense of incompletion but not in a good way<br />* there isn't a big wow factor<br />* don't see much of the zombies and looks animated at times<br />* it was just plain ok<br /><br />Overall, I'm glad I waited for DVD release, but still recommend it if you're a zombie lover.
B003UERZ88|3.0|Not a bad album, by any means, but everything from Halford will be compared to the Resurrection album (or even just the song) and in this case, despite Metal Mike's best churning, this comes up short. If some judicious editing were done and it were halved and made into an EP, it would probably be a pretty strong one...but it isn't. The artwork is also incredibly odd and off-putting.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Specially having such a great cast!! This movie was awesome!! It certainly was entertaining and was everything I expected from QT movies and more.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I'm terrible at messaging on my phone, so this app helps me clean up my texts (less misspelling).  This app is great at auto filling when I'm texting or emailing.  The swyping takes some getting used to but once you master it, you'll wonder how you were able to text without this feature.  I got it free from a one day amazon promotion, but I think I would willingly pay for this app.
B004YF6MHW|1.0|When you trigger the shot it saves a grey rectangle instead of the picture that you had in the screen at the time of shooting.<br />It does not work with my device FAEA F1
B004T4LUPW|5.0|Nice app that I got for free from Amazon app store (it was a one day promotion).  Synced with my work calendar (Microsoft Exchange) easily.  Interface is nice and easy to update and read.  It's a bit pricey at $5.99, but it is a step up from the stock calendar.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|Then all of sudden it would start locking up on me. Finally, I could not longer play as the app would not open!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|A really sincere movie done perfectly.  The characters are multi-dimensional and drive towards the feeling of fitting in during high school and so much more.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|I loved the characters and even though I knew from the beginning that it would be sad, I cried and cried .
0123694965|5.0|First time I read about game design. Jesse schell is a genius. This is written so well. Must have it if ur interested in game-designing. Cheers
B001224WBS|1.0|Are you an old fan? Do you like Depeche Mode, and are you just trying to get a bunch of the tracks that your ex-girlfriend took with her in the late 90s before you'd ripped all of them to Mp3? Or did you lose all of your MP3s from Napster in the Great Hard Disk Failure of 2003?<br /><br />Don't buy this album. Really, don't. It has the best tracks, but they're not the originals you loved. There's like four or six tracks that sound like they did when first recorded, and one of those is marked as \\"Original\\", which probably means that they re-recorded it but the re-recording was worse than the bad recordings on this album. Shake the Disease sounds like it was done by a cover band with autotune. Master and Servant sounds like it was sung through a vuvuzuela. Everything Counts must have been recorded in a Karaoke bar. Others are better. Personal Jesus, Strangelove, and others sound like they should.<br /><br />I really had to confirm that this wasn't one of the albums you see sold on late-night TV by \\"The Original Artists\\" or \\"DePeach Mode\\" or something.

B008JJM88Q|5.0|This app is FREAKING AWESOME!!! I got it and it is SO FUN! I showed my mom and brother and they were amazed. My dad thought it was conspiracy, and it was really fun to watch him get really annoyed at Akinator! He even made me switch to another app, turn my kindle off, and put it between pillows in another room. Their reactions were priceless, when after 20 questions or so, it guesses the EXACT character. Totally worth $2. No drawbacks, at all. Fun to show family, friends, yourself, (and even pets!!!). I would give it a 10/5 if I could.
0307346617|2.0|This book was awful.  I wanted a good zombie book to read on vacation.  Instead I got  several short stories of the zombie apocalypse. I am so disappointed that I won't read another book by this author.

B001N9ESQ4|5.0|This is probably one of the best love stories I've ever watched, the chemistry between the two actors are amazing and the fact that it is a trilogy makes it even better
B0043CSBKC|2.0|It is inexcuseable for an american company to be selling something titled \\"akira, dvd, director...etc\\" and not mention that its an italian version. In the description in small print it does tell you. lame

044022425X|4.0|Book had cover wear and tear, but readable.<br />Regular wear you get on a soft cover book.<br />but cheaper in soft cover..
B008JFUO0Y|5.0|I know I'm bound to piss some purists off and include some spoilers so be forewarned. Okay first off, I was never a huge fan of the original film, okay I said it, I found the plot to be just another kids in a cabin getting killed film without a huge amount of reason as to why they were there other than to go camping, in this film we have a plausible beginning to the horrors to follow and a totally believable reason as to why these young people ended up in this cabin. What follows is both terrifying, gory, dramatic and at times emotional because of the relationships that we actually care about because of the brief but effective back story we're given. While this film successfully keeps the feel and essentially the same evil that causes the horror in the original film it also does a very fantastic job of including some of the iconic movies from the original film(s). My favorite part of this film is how they've basically combined characters storylines from the original film(s) in very creative ways. I would highly recommend this film to horror film lovers.
B007PVHMCG|4.0|This is an awesome collectors set for the Minecraft fan. Just not the young fan... All the pieces are the super small bricks so not so good for the 13 and under kids...
0061122416|4.0|I'm only a few pages into the book and am hooked.  It seems to be a common theme in my life lessons right now----recognizing what you already have.

B006S08RLU|5.0|I love this movie for all the creativity that went to it. We watched it as a Instant Stream. It was good quality no stop or stutter. Sound was good too.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|What a true American hero!<br />It is a sad state that our liberal media and liberal politicians have such an effect on our servicemen and woman!
B0042TV4IW|3.0|My wife said give it 4 stars. I myself, being somewhat of a curmudgeon this morning, think it is but a 3. So let's say we as a family plump for 3.5 - at least for Season 1. Now, I really love the idea of depicting life in an English village or a small town out in the country. And I'm very fond of les mani&egrave;res anglais. The issue I'm having is that the episodes have (a) a regrettable soap operaish element, (b) they lack inter-episodic cohesion and (c) some scenes worth their salt such as a difficult interaction between Laura and her father, the &#34;final&#34; break between Dorcas and Sir Timothy, the mounting tension between Alf and Philip and the pressure that it has on Laura's feelings for both men happen all too infrequently. I also regret the more than adequate coverage given to Twister - a caricature of a country jester of some sort perhaps? There was no need at all to resurrect him in the last episode. The script writer is merciless, evidently. :-). So for the most part the episodes merely lumber along. Let's hope for a better Season 2.
B00CD4RPWM|1.0|Outlander is by far the best book series I have ever read. Enough to read all 7 books 4 times. So maybe I was spoiled, but this &#34;graphic novel&#34; is not worth the effort to read it. Diane Gabaldon tells a wonderful story, with rich characters you love or hate. None of that can be found in this story, never finished it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I purchased Hugh Howey's Wool Omnibus 1-5 to see why the series had become so popular and launched Howey's career from indie author to potential mega-stardom. My curious was rewarded with one of the best post-apocalyptic science fiction stories I've ever read. The book transcends the genre's clich&eacute;s to create a post-nuclear world far removed from contemporary reality but strangely near in its intimate dealing with human nature. Many are calling the Wool series \\"classic,\\" and I agree.<br /><br />Wool Omnibus is a series of five novellas that follow the lives of multiple protagonists who live in Silo 18, a large underground bunker in what was once Georgia burrowed in the ground as deep as a skyscraper. Designed centuries ago to protect the remnant of mankind from a harsh environment on the earth's surface rendered lethal by nuclear strikes, Silo 18 thrives on rules and order intended to keep its inhabitants as safe and secure as they can be in an underworld. The effect of this stark environment on the personalities and behaviors of the characters that appear in the series makes them all too human. The humanity of Howey's story is what sets it apart from other action-driven books in the genre. The rich, multi-layered world he created lends itself to an expanding universe, perhaps even a multiverse.<br /><br />Howey cleverly wraps up the plotlines at the end of each novella enough to leave the reader satisfied that the story has ended but leaves unanswered questions that draw readers further into his world. The five-part series brings the story to a close but whets one's taste for more. Combining the novellas into a single novel addresses the one concern I had about the book - that each novella ends much too soon with too many cliffhangers. The Omnibus assuages this.<br /><br /> Wool Omnibus 1-5 earns my enthusiastic praise as one of the best stories in the science fiction genre. I give it five stars and highly recommend it to any reader. Even those who do not like post-apocalyptic stories should find something to love.t-apocalyptic stories should find something to love.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|This book should be required reading for all those professionals who work with or legislate concerning children.  It explodes so many of our dearly held assumptions concerning worldly success and the complexity of elements that often invisibly make it possible.  A fascinating book.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Outstanding writing and acting. Keeps you at the edge of your seat each week...The best show in a long time!!!!
B00BRUQ3PS|3.0|But I will probably read it again.  Need to go back and read Oryx and Crake first-there was enough time between the three books that I need to refresh my memory of the original.
1476727651|1.0|I've not read a King novel in several years, but thought a sequel to The Shining would be good. Little did I know that I would actually be reading an infomercial for Alcoholics Anonymous. A lot of time and paper could have been saved by just printing the 12 steps and a few of the inane sayings.
B00F91G5BS|4.0|I love these kinds of movie, and this one certainly did not disappoint ,I will be watching this again for sure.
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|Very good story line. Just when you can't put it down it's over. Definitely need a sequel. I haven't collected all my angels.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I was looking for software to keep my kindle clean and running smooth and this app was exactly what I was looking for,it runs in the back ground so you hardly know it working,but it is
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Fast paced, exciting, and well thought out. Brad Pitt brings a level of uncompromising class to the film with his superb portrayal of the lead character.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|Good game. My 4 year old enjoys as well.  Good stuff. Very easy to play this game. The sequel is fun too.
B008XCM18Q|3.0|For fans of Jason Bourne, this is the seminal work and is key to re minding the reader of the real story (as opposed to the movie script that bears little resemblance). But it would be nice if the makers of these ebooks would proofread their work. This one is full of OCR problems that requires you to keep the paper copy as reference!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is amazing. You should get it. You get to take care a real fake horse. It is awesome.
B00D2K40WY|4.0|Fun for 6 year old granddaughter!  She plays several times a day; while creating unique designs. Always excited to share with me.
B008M4MB8K|5.0|Kept looking for the set for quite a while, until the price got whre I wanted it.  Love having three versions of the movie on the DVD's.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|love this game! cant wait for more levels! this game is very addicting. I do not want to put it down. Hurry up and make new levels!!
B0089LOG02|5.0|This story was amazing to read.  It brought in so much history that I was unaware of and was fascinated by.  It really is on the top of my recommended book list.  Once again when I recommend a book and have a few of my closest friends read it and get their feedback we are all on the same page.  This is a highly loved book!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Entertaining while educating about the intracies of the law, keeps you wanting to come back for more! Great to see women of color in positions of power while looking fabulous in great  fashions.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|well I had 20 keys well I know that I went to facebook<br />in their I was playing friends for free I had coco Paris special in kick Miami. special<br />I really loved. this game in I know I unlocked domes qief<br />In I unlocked tricky clotes
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|my mom used to have this game. brings back childhood memories. I play it AT LEAST once a day. love it.
B005PR2FD8|3.0|I bought this because I love Tekken.  This,  however,  was more soap opera than Tekken.  There is very little fighting to break up the drama.  The animation is vey good, make no mistake,  but don't buy this if you're looking for an action-packed fighting romp.  It simply is not,  and I can't see why Namco went this direction with it.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I am so sad that the story has ended! What a wonderful book. I feel as if I know Vivian and Molly. The author has written a heartwarming tale that is sure to touch her reader's hearts. I am excited to see what other adventures have been created by Mrs. Kline.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Chromecast works great! Smooth performance,  youtube and Netflix videos look great you jist need a good internet connection,  realy hope new app are added to the mix. Recommended!!!!! For this price is almost ridiculous not to get one ;)
B000JML90Y|5.0|What more can I say? This book has earned its place in the annals of history. Any person desiring knowledge and education should read this book, and come to grips with the largest, most complex and beautiful phenomenon shaping our universe.
B00E0SX118|5.0|Our whole family loved it.  Everyone from teens to granny thought it was cute, I would definite recommend this one
B00D2CYU2W|3.0|not sure if this is too much or not enough, seems if they were going to go for it, they should have more than this but if they weren't, they might have pulled back. I thought Debbie Reynolds was wasted as Frances as was the guy from Mad About You as an attorney. I thought Matt Damon was less Matt Damon than he usually is and seemed to be acting like troubled Scott and it is clear Mikey Douglas enjoyed playing Lee, maybe a little too much. Like a lot of Soderbergh's work, it seems to lose something on the small screen and i'm not sure how this would have done in theaters. That said, i'd watch this one again, if only to see Cheyenne Jackson seethe and Rob Lowe slither his way through a performance as a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon. Too real.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I really like the features the app offers, rotate songs for my alarm, the dimming feature for the clock face - the temp feature isn't terribly accurate, but it's due to location of weather stations around my area. Would definitely recommend for any Kindle Fire user.
B00E6F159A|4.0|it's hard to believe he's doing his best work this late in the game but Bryan Ferry pulls it off, i could watch this forever. I could do without the dancers or the saxophone playing bird who always seems to be taking her curtain call but otherwise, first rate. I noticed the tempo of some of the old numbers like \\"Bride Stripped Bare\\" seemed to be speeded up from the original and it was odd to hear him singing his own backup vocals from time to time but as i said, this is a true master doing his very best work.
1250030951|5.0|I wasn't sure if Rowell could top the brilliantly written and constructed Eleanor & Park, but when I was at BEA and St. Martin's hosted Rainbow at their booth for signed copies of Fangirl, I couldn't resist.<br /><br />Anyway, the novel is completely different than E & P in the sense that it is told from one point of view, it involves a large amount of geekiness (which I loved), and the main characters are all in college.<br /><br />The pros to this novel having one point of view is that the reader is completely involved in Cath's neuroses and we are forced to understand how scary it is for an introvert to move from a comfortable situation to a totally new college campus a few hours from home to live with a roommate that she doesn't know while being seemingly abandoned by her twin sister.  Whew, that was a lot.<br /><br />The inclusion of a faux novel universe and the idea of fan fiction was definitely a new angle for young adult fiction, despite the fact that fan fiction is specifically written by fans for fans.  I really adore Rowell for writing about how important fan fiction really can be to massive fans of television shows, book series, and even movies.  I don't know about you, but I 100% relate to the fact that Cath is a rabid Simon Snow fan.  As a huge Doctor Who fan myself, I find it wonderful that an author supports the writing and reading of fan fiction.  On the other hand, I really appreciate how Rowell depicts the struggle between writing and creating your own fictional world versus writing \\"within\\" an already constructed world.<br /><br />I also really enjoyed how organically the relationships developed between Cath and the secondary characters.  The unlikely friendship between Cath and Reagan, and the adorable and awkward relationship between Cath and Levi really helped spring Cath off the page and made her more realistic.<br /><br />In addition, I think that Cath and Wren's relationship with their father was handled extremely well by Rowell, and I could really feel how hard it was for Cath to cope with her father's mental illness and how it affected her behavior and her fear of getting out of her comfort zone.<br /><br />Things that didn't work for me:  I really wanted some more closure in the mother situation and for Wren to be a bit less self centered, but I think that comes from my intense dislike of her due to what she did to Cath early on in the novel.<br /><br />Overall I really enjoyed this novel and I remain on the edge of my seat for the announcement of Rowell's next novel and can only hope that I get an advanced copy for that one as well!<br /><br />4.5 Bardsld really feel how hard it was for Cath to cope with her father's mental illness and how it affected her behavior and her fear of getting out of her comfort zone.<br /><br />Things that didn't work for me:  I really wanted some more closure in the mother situation and for Wren to be a bit less self centered, but I think that comes from my intense dislike of her due to what she did to Cath early on in the novel.<br /><br />Overall I really enjoyed this novel and I remain on the edge of my seat for the announcement of Rowell's next novel and can only hope that I get an advanced copy for that one as well!<br /><br />4.5 Bards
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Loved this book. I've especially enjoyed chapters about (1) Jon (Night Watch), (2) Theon/Ramsay Bolton and even (3) Bran's travel beyond the Wall.<br /><br />Tyrion and Daenarys didn't hold my interest as much as in the previous books. Cercei and Jamie are hardly present in this book.<br /><br />Hope that Jon Snow is still alive in the next book, and Mr. Martin explores into his developing his skinchanger abilities and becoming a better leader of his people. He is an example of a good leader and a decent human being, using his new found authority as a Lord Commander for benefit of the people. He is one of the most promising and fastest growing characters in the series.<br /><br />Story line about Bran's travel North seeking a greenseer, and eventually becoming one, and merging into a tree (and through one tree gaining an access to the network connecting all the wierwood trees in the North) is very creative and raises interesting questions.<br /><br />This 5th book in the series is very long but absolutely worse reading it. Can't wait for the next book!
1250012570|5.0|A book set in 1986?  I was most definitely skeptical when I first read the synopsis, I mean how much could I relate to a book that is set in the year before I was born?  (I know this makes no sense, especially because of how much I adore historical fiction, but still, the 80s aren't history yet, right?) But, I was extremely wrong. I positively adored Eleanor & Park.<br /><br />Not only was the prose split genius-ly between two very differently voiced characters, but the sentence structure was brilliant and the vocabulary was excellent. Rowell's book used many of my favorite things to bring the main characters together: discussion of music, books, and comics. (Although, I will say that since the story takes place in 1986, I really want to look up all of the comic stories that Rowell uses and make sure nothing happened in the comics after 1986 that is in there.  That is just the comic nerd in me. But I trust Rowell.  I guess I just need an excuse to go back to comics for a little bit! )<br /><br />I love that Rowell's story not only managed to provide a realistic high school love story between two somewhat misfits, but that there are some deep rooted social issues involved as well.  Rowell explores the horrible pain that comes from a broken family and an \\"evil\\" stepfather, and even the feeling of being an outcast due to being the only person of your race in an overwhelmingly bland population in a small town.<br /><br />So if you are looking for a break from the paranormal, the dystopian, and get back to a Sarah Dessen -type teen romance, then I think that Rowell's novel is a perfect read for you.<br /><br />I wish I could say that I'd get to host Rowell in an author spotlight here on A Midsummer Night's Read, but she is so busy promoting this amazing novel that I couldn't book her!<br /><br />4.5 Bards
B00ENTDDGW|3.0|if the full version was free i wold buy glow hockey and recommended the game to my friends and family.
0062255657|4.0|I admit that I am a bit of a noob when it comes to Neil Gaiman.  Other than having read Neverwhere and Stardust, the only other exposure I've had to him is through the episodes of Doctor Who that he has written ('The Doctor's Wife' is still one of the best episodes ever).<br /><br />So when a librarian friend of mine (Thanks, Genna!) told me that she had read The Ocean at the End of the Lane shortly after it was released, I knew that it was something I had to pick up.  I mean, everyone should trust the opinion of their librarian on what books are good and which ones to avoid.<br /><br />Anyway, I was surprised by how short this novel was when I picked up a copy, but after reading it I completely understand that the story could be no more and no less. Gaiman has an impeccable way of doing that.  Initially, I was put off by the middle aged nameless narrator since I was expecting more of a children's novel based on what I had been told.  However, this narrator serves as the framework for the story that is told through the point of view of a young boy.<br /><br />The reader is quickly introduced to the sleepy, small town in Suffolk that serves as the setting.  For some reason all the countryside really reminded me of the use of the Moors in Wuthering Heights; especially when the narrator is running toward the Hempstock farm in the dark. In addition, Gaiman quickly involves us in the story world with the suicide of the man and the wonderful inclusion of Lettie, who serves as a guiding light for the narrator and his only friend.<br /><br />I want to encourage everyone to read this novel.  While Gaiman never truly explains where the Hempstocks are from or how long they have truly been a part of our world, he does include enough information for the reader to be satisfied and still be on the verge of asking a billion questions.<br /><br />Gaiman, you have sufficiently pleased me again.<br /><br />4 Bards.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|I love this series! I used to watch this when I was younger and I liked the fact that the main character is a woman doctor in the mid 1800's that finds a job on the frontier. All of the episodes deal with some type of conflict for example, disease and sterilization of tools, death, racism, Native American's being on reservations and losing their heritage, women in the field of medicine, love, the Union Pacific, and hardships that the frontier presented at the time. And this series comes with 1-6 seasons and 2 movies. I have only gotten through 4 seasons so far and I am getting pretty upset that it will be over soon. So, if you are looking for a good series for the family or just in general, I would recommend this one.
1592407889|5.0|Ms Parker's account of her childhood and adult life as the daughter of Shirley MacLaine spotlight the wounds narcissists causes to those who love them. I appreciate her candor and positive attitude. She did not succumb to drugs or suicide as is typical. She rose above it all to tell a tale those of us with similar, albeit non famous, parents also endured. Thank you, Sachi
B00B52F278|5.0|If these are words that pop out at you and that is something that you would like to watch, then this series/season is for you! Who wouldn't want to watch buff dudes, and cut chicks slicing up Romans due to their oppressive rule. I would recommend this season/series for anyone who wants to watch hunky guys fight in gladiator attire. And cursing is taken to a whole new level as well! The only downside is that each season has only about 10-12 episodes. :( But very enjoyable episodes)
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|Great show. Season 5 is the first time I watched Doctor Who, now it's hard to watch other versions when Matt Smith isn't the Dr.
B00EE3FVSU|2.0|ill-conceived waste of a lot of good talent. Abrupt, coarse, recycled, loosely-strung. It's as if they all of a sudden realized, &#34;Holy cow, we'd better wrap this whole thing up&#34; at around episode 6. I'm a fan of British murder mysteries AND David Tenant, so I was sure that this was going to be great. Nope. Husband and I were actually yelling, &#34;AAAARRRRGGGGHHH! Lame!&#34; at the TV after the end of the season. Gah.
1781162646|5.0|Loved the whole plot, satisfied how it came all together in the end. Stephen king is back and hope he keeps it coming.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|This is a mahjong tile puzzle game.  You match tiles and try to clear the board.  The game has many different tile designs, backgrounds, and tile stack formations.  The sound is bland, but the artwork is good and the touch recognition is excellent.  It is definitely worth the $0.99 price tag.  If it cost more, I wouldn't recommend it, but definitely worth a buck.  I recommend it to age 6+ fans of mahjong and other puzzle games.
B00634GHJA|5.0|I had no problem transfering pictures from my pc, tablet or phone. It's so much easier wireless and worth the price.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|This is a hidden object game.  You follow a storyline through different levels with different puzzles, most of which require you to find hidden objects.  The artwork is great, the sound is good, the touch recognition is proper and the replay value is ok.  It functioned perfectly on my Kindle Fire.  The major downsides?  The first is the unending dialogue that seems to go on forever, with unnecessary content.  The second is the high level of confusion in many of the puzzles.  I don't want to let out any spoilers, so I'll just say that there were a few times where I got confused and had to use a hint.  The hint confused me even more!  Finally, it had a hard, but not insane, draw on my battery.  For these reasons I gave it four stars.  I recommend it to ages 8+ fans of hidden object games.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This is a great book with a magical story line.  I am 65% through it and hope they make a movie (keeping it true to the book of course).  It will be sad to get to the end of this book.
B004ADB17Y|5.0|This is a movie I never get tired of watching, My kids find it as fun to watch as I did and still do. Its truly a film for all ages.
B005ZB91KY|3.0|Good family entertainment with my 10 and 12 year old.  Good action seen sans connection to Avendures and Ironman movies
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|My son loves this game! He just turned four. The graphics are amazing and its great that he is able to create his own reef. While exploring he's also able to learn!
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I read this after watching the entire season on Netflix. It was very interesting to see what aspects from the show were based in part or in whole by real events or real people. If you love the show you must read the book!
B009MYARIK|1.0|I have read all of Kinsella's previous books and enjoyed most of them. I forced myself to finish this one.  Totally unbelievable and far fetched.  Don't waste your money or your time.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I have really enjoyed season 1 and am looking forward to season2. I have enjoyed a glimpse of how the lower class British families lived.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great writing, acting, settings, with an historical background that gives you glimpses not only into the lives of the gentry in Britain but world events.  The characters are endearing.  I love the old morality.  Everyone trying to do what's right.  My favorite episode was the final episode of season two.
B00BKBCF38|5.0|The best way to describe these guys are like the Beatles... If the Beatles worshiped the devil. I highly recommend this Album.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Good for younger children. Kind of boring. I will probably cancel it.Not very much action or skill for an adult
B003I55BIA|4.0|I liked the story. the plot, the characters. This is the typical bad boy who likes someone out of his \\"range\\", but they like each other and they go against everything they ever thought, and they win in the end.
B00E0S52K6|5.0|If you like straight ahead blues, screaming guitars, a smattering of horns, and BUDDY GUY, this is it!! Just good tunes done well. I think it's the best Buddy Guy album yet. Even with a few guests, they never get away from the blues.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|you should play this game it is really fun<br />and really interesting. its cool I hope you review it yourself
B0089LOG02|5.0|I had never heard of orphan trains until I read this book.  It's difficult to believe that children were ushered from town to town  or family to family in hopes of being accepted into a family.  Then the author introduces a character in foster care who undergoes a similar yet more \\"civil\\" process.  Two women who seemingly have nothing in common share a common tie-to find peace. I couldn't put the book down.
0553212419|4.0|I only bought it because of my english class, it's fairly well for a soft covered book. I would have rated a 5 if it was hard cover, other than that this book saved me because i need to read it for homework and i can't bring my teacher's sherlock books home. It's more than 1000 pages!!! it's actually pretty interesting if you're into mystery. Buy it if you're interested! trust me!
B006PZBR8S|5.0|The premise seems so strange. Hugh Jackman in a movie about robots? But it is really good! Trust me you'll enjoy it.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Has your computer ever fallen off your WiFi network? Have you ever experienced slowdowns with file transfers over WiFi? Have you ever tried using a game console over WiFi, given up and switched to a wired connection? Have you ever lived in a densely populated area, used a WiFi scanner and realized that there are dozens of other wireless networks in your neighborhood, all interfering with each other?<br /><br />On paper it's a decent idea: A little stick that you plug into your TV and then wirelessly throw content to it from a computer, phone or tablet. If you live in the middle of nowhere, have no WiFi interference and a perfect WiFi signal in your living room, you'll probably love Chromecast. But if any of the WiFi problems above sound familiar, you're going to have a bad time with Chromecast.<br /><br />For most of us, WiFi is unreliable for streaming hours of content and this device does not handle network connectivity issues well. It will sometimes stop playing after a couple of minutes, or the controls on your phone might lose their connection (so you can't stop or pause the video that's still playing.) Until there's a model that can use a wired network connection for streaming (this thing has a USB port on the back, so it *could* support a wired upgrade if Google made one), and the casting apps more gracefully recover from any errors - Chromecast is very difficult to recommend.
B008JFUN6E|4.0|In the year 2154, the earth is ravaged and overpopulated. Only the wealthiest can live in the ring-shaped space station called Elysium. The basic concept of this utopian/dystopian futuristic world is nothing original, but what makes \\"Elysium,\\" writer/director Neill Blomkamp's much anticipated follow-up to \\"District 9,\\" is its stunning visuals including the unique designs of the space station.<br /><br />A reformed car thief Max (Matt Damon) living in ruined LA gets severely injured while working at a factory, and he has only five days to live. To get the medical care he needs, Max attempts to infiltrate Elysium, a heavily fortified gated community in charge of ruthless Secretary of Defense Jessica Delacourt (Jodie Foster). But things get more complicated as they go, of course.<br /><br />Alice Braga (\\"City of God\\") plays Max's childhood friend Frey. Sharlto Copley, star of \\"District 9,\\" is a mercenary hired by Delacourt. Wagner Moura (\\"Elite Squad\\") is a smuggler \\"Spider.\\" Diego Luna is Max's friend Julio assisting him.<br /><br />The film's premise has strong political undertones, which, as the story goes on, are often overshadowed by a series of fierce combat action, but those overtones remain in the conclusion that you will either like or hate. I enjoyed watching \\"Elysium\\" as a sci-fi adventure action, though I expected something different, perhaps more originality, from the director of \\"District 9.\\"

B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I had left my phone/alarm clock at the office, and had an early meeting the next day. I downloaded this app for my kindle and it does what it says it does. easy to use, good user interface.

B000JIN3J8|5.0|We have watched more than on version of this, including a more modern version.  Of all the others this one from BBC is by far the very best.
B003PBB4ME|4.0|The Opteka X-GRIP Professional Camera / Camcorder Action Stabilizing Handle is a handy product for controlling a dslr or camcorder's free flowing pan effects. I was pleased that such an inexpensive product would actually work as promised.<br />The only thing that I found problematic is the hot shoe attachment at the top. Because of the deep indented top slot that holds the removable hot shoe, I found it difficult to mount an external audio recorder instead of light. I was able to rig an apparatus that would work but it wasn't easy. On the other hand, if you want to mount a different accessory, it is easy to tape a microphone audio recorder to the unit's top.<br /><br />Opteka (225)
B006OISHGQ|3.0|I think the book is good, but it requires either a disk or online version of the language.  I expected more of a text type book, complete in itself.  Not what I expected.
B00ECU2SGS|5.0|Mud is a very interesting and well developed story that contains elements of mystery, coming of age, family conflict, political corruption, romance, and adventure. It is somewhat reminiscent of Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn but has a more modern theme. The characters are compelling and memorable. This is a movie for the ages.<br />The download rental was excellent, color was great and the sound quality was superb.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|\\"Dr. Sleep\\" is a most unusual sequel.  Written and published 36 years after \\"The Shining\\", it was neither hinted at nor demanded by the original, Stephen King's third published novel but the first of his long, long string of hardcover best-sellers.  King has sold several hundred million copies of his novels, and has more money than anyone could spend in several lifetimes, so why even attempt to write a sequel to a critically and popularly acknowledged classic of modern horror?  If ever there was a set-up for a huge knock-down panning of the writer that a lot of people seem to love to hate, this would be it.  But King himself says that he often wondered about what happened to Danny Torrence and that he approached Dr. Sleep with \\"trepidation\\".  Lucky for us that he plunged ahead.  Dr. Sleep is that rarity, a completely self-contained novel that is also a completely satisfying sequel to a long-ago published fabulously successful horror classic.  This is not King's first try at a sequel - several years ago he and co-author Peter Straub published \\"Black House\\", a sequel to \\"The Talisman\\" that, while still a fair enough novel, was much less a sequel than a completely different story whose protagonist was the adult version of the teen-aged Jack Sawyer who ventured back and forth through an alternate universe in the Talisman that was completely absent in the sequel.  Not so with Dr. Sleep.<br /><br />Dr. Sleep gives us the grown up Danny (now Dan) Torrance.  He still has a bit of the shine, but has not used it much, and has in fact dulled it by becoming an alcoholic, just like dear old dad. After years of this, he hits rock bottom after waking up next to a girl he met in a bar and remembering that he just spent his last dime on booze and an ounce of coke that her toddler son mistakes for candy.  Dan leaves and ends up in a small New Hampshire town where he finds AA and gets straight, and finds a job at a hospice, using his shine to help the dying transition.  Over the course of several years, Dan becomes increasingly aware of the existence of Abra, another child who possesses the shine, but one immensely more powerful than Dan's.  Abra also comes to the attention of a group of very long-lived psychic vampires called \\"The True Knot\\". Some of The True are nearly a thousand years old, and they subsist, masquerading as a group of middle-aged and elderly Winnebago riding normal humans, by torturing and killing children with the shine (called \\"steam\\" by the True) to ingest and store their power.  Arba enlists Dan's help to avoid becoming the next victim of the True, and the battle is joined.<br /><br />Although self-contained as mentioned above, there are references to people, places and things that featured, some prominently and some not prominently in \\"The Shining\\".  If you've read the Shining, you'll probably remember and appreciate these references.  If not, you're still going to be OK (but you are depriving yourself of a great read and should grab a copy of The Shining just for the sake of a great read).  The Overlook Hotel, scene of The Shining burned to the ground at the end of that novel, but with Stephen King, places are often as powerful as things, and Dan Torrance will come full circle with the horrors that terrorized him 35-odd years ago at the Overlook.<br /><br />It was great to revisit characters and ideas created by a 30-something Stephen King in the voice of the 60-something King.  He has clearly mellowed in many respects, but the mature King is no less a master of fantasy and horror than his 30-plus year younger doppelg&auml;nger.  Dr. Sleep may not be the horror-fest that The Shining was, but it is a great and successful sequel to the novel that first made Stephen King a  household name.<br /><br />HIghly Recommended.<br /><br />J.M.

B002XHNMVM|5.0|Inspiring, fun and down-to-earth.  Everyone that's feeling lost walking through life without meaning should read this book.  Likewise for parents that have children they don't understand because they believe they're not fitting in 'correctly' in society.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|I got to Broadchurch late in the season, and it immediately  hooked me.  Everything you think you figured out in the first 10 minutes is going to change for you by the end of the first episode; and each episodeis packed w/ all the elements of a great suspense tail!  The story line, the acting, the true element of surprise is what a great mystery story should be, and Broadchurch does NOT disappoint.  I couldn't wait for the next one and watched each one again so as not to miss anything.  I just wish there were more of them!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I LOVE DESPICABLE ME AND I LOVE MINION RUSH!!!! This was a really fun game and my sister and I enjoyed it a lot. Thank you Gameloft!
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Daniel Craig is a great choice for Bond! He brings new angles and even more depth to a beloved character.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it is so fun<br />It is one of my favorites I gave this app 5 stars because you can change the setting and the minion!!!!!!!
B004G600A4|5.0|This is such a cute movie.  I swear Disney puts some jokes that only adults would understand!  It's great!  Love Max the horse!
B008YRVW0I|5.0|Enjoy playing this game . I can't put this game down. It's fun for the whole family. My granddaughter love playing this game too.
B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|Could not get into this book.  I tried several times.  I am not going to make myself read something, that doesn't hold my attention.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|Great novel..this book really makes japanese history fascinating even though its fiction. It made me want to learn more about japan.
B002SHD9E2|5.0|One of my favorite movies.  I watche the first part over and over again.  It's the best part of the movie.  Gerard Butler did a great job being the phantom
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I loved the video so it was no question that I loved the game! Plus it is hilarious! But I would suggest to go to options and turn off the plane game though. I think the hardest one is the plane one or the glue one. But this game is still on my favorites list. But I think they should make a game for every little character because it would be more fun but that doesn't mean that this game is not worth playing. It is very good. I loved it! :-)
B003M6FGTE|5.0|watched it on my kindle Never on TV  Love this season Too.  My grand daughter loved it too. Thank You
B00871C09S|5.0|One of the old movie greats. This movie still holds my interest, even after watching it many times over the years. Less violent and not over the top like some of todays movies. The restoration is fairly good, but it looked much better when I sized the screen a little smaller. The sound is excellent,  clear and has no background noise level. Definitely a welcomed addition to my DVD collection.
B00DK9FNLY|1.0|This is just an average game and really not that much fun to play.  The paddle tends to lie directly under my huge finger so I cannot judge where the ball exactly is and it makes the game more difficult to play.  Since the table does not go to the end of the screen I don't understand why your finger cannot be on the bottom of the screen and control the paddle from there so you can see the entire table and have better visibility.<br /><br />Game play is boring and I noticed that no matter how I hit the ball that it tends to spin in a curve after it hits the table and it curves right into my opponents paddle.  Wonderful, an AI that cheats!  As mentioned in several other reviews the game's physics are not correct and I constantly felt that the opponent had an advantage that makes playing a boring game just more frustrating.<br /><br />Now to the bad part, I hate apps that use intrusive means to track your location.  There is only one purpose for that and it is to push unwanted ads to your device.  I also don't like having to spam my friends or like a game on Facebook in order to be allowed to get the entire game that is supposedly paid for.  That is essentially blackmail.<br /><br />This is a game that is not much fun to play in my opinion and the intrusiveness of the software is just enough to make me not want to have it on my tablet.  After a few games I simply sent it back to the cloud.
B00F8GYC1Y|2.0|Downloaded the game today. Great game and graphics,  but after playing a level or two,  the game slows down, freezes quite often, and there are flashes randomly all over the screen where you can see the pixels. I gave up trying to play it. Maybe it is just a problem on the Kindle Fire? Not impressed.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Good, suspenful and cool! I enjoyed every moment! You need to like such movies though to enjoy this one!<br />The bottom line, if this is your type you'll like it
B00BXZ3D6Y|1.0|The sound quality is so bad I thought there was something wrong with my tablet.  it was very tiny and sounded like it was being recorded in a shower. You may have different results with your device but for my Acer Iconia a 1 810 it did not work well. Another free voice recording app worked beautifully.I believe it was called the easy voice recorder and has a blue microphone icon.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very fun and addicting.  I played this to pass the time on a long trip.  Good graphics.  Variety in play options.
B009ME47H2|5.0|This app was very easy to use and the sound quality was great. Another voice recorder I tried left me thinking it was something wrong with my tablet. This app works great with my Acer Iconia A 1 810.
B00170F0WU|4.0|good show. a little odd when this 35 yo odd ball falls in love with a 12 yo girl and she him. but their relationship is actually kinda precious. they needed each other. the revenge part could have been better worked out. I think for morals sake he had to die. otherwise they would of had to figure out what to do with the relationship. that would have been difficult writing. enjoy.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Hey, what can I say about this HOT book!<br />Has any one not read it? Do pick it up and you can't put it down.
B00F91H666|4.0|Interesting, decent zombie movie. This movie has been given a lot of harsh reviews, but it was really a decent zombie flick. The virus probably infected too quickly to be too real, but it's a movie. The acting was great. Very thrilling to watch.
B00BOA9MVI|5.0|Wonderful story about the good of humankind even in times of war. It shows us once again how small the world is and that these two gentlemen not only survived the war but also old age to meet each other after so many years.
0061122416|5.0|This book is a great read, once I started the book I couldn't stop. the story is very exciting and reviving.
B009NCM248|3.0|Good old Stone Sour always a sound all their own and instantly recognizable but for the good. Hard with passion.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Not like your solitare! It has missions and is fun. I would recommend to anyone that enjoys a good puzzle or card game.
B004GJXQ20|5.0|I would never usually read a book after having viewed the TV show/movie, however the more I watched season one of this show, the more I thought I wanted to read the books.  I have just finished book one after having watched the whole of season one, and have to say I absolutely loved it.  Despite the show being very true to the book, the book contained so much additional detail and really helped the whole story make so much more sense to me.  I couldn't wait to begin book two, which I've just done.<br /><br />This is a very clever and enjoyable book with so much happening you just can't put it down.  There are a huge amount of characters and a whole new world and the thought gone into this book is amazing.  There is action, violence, humor, twists and turns and unexpected events.  Some of the characters are extremely likeable and some you loathe and there are so many questions that I just want to keep on reading without waiting for the rest of the show to be made.  One of the best books I've read yet and despite the length of them, they don't feel long as so much is happening you forget about the length.  Highly recommend.
B008NR8YTQ|2.0|Imagine they took the guy from Black Sabbath, shot him up with amphetamines, and told him, \\"Play something bluesy.\\" Listening to this, I felt embarrassed for Mitch and Billy.
B000HSKUBE|4.0|You have to see this version of the House of Cards before you watch the NetFlix version. Ian Richardson does a excellent job in the role of the majority whip. And you will see similarity in the filming technique. Although I didn't remember the rest of the cast from when I watched it on PBS. You'll like it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is ALWAYS entertaining. Never fails. A Good game. Never gets boring! Plus it's free, just download it! Kids and adults will enjoy. Coming from a Mom of a 18month, it always creates a good time.
B00FCIROYK|3.0|It's alright, but read the track listing before you buy.  There are some key songs I wanted that didn't make it onto the album.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|This game is a must have if you love the Magic card games. It plays the same as the full computer version.
B00ECLU346|2.0|Wasn't as good as the last two only a few parts were funny wish I didn't buy it bad purchase
B009GEAPYW|4.0|This movie and it's companion are great movies. Very literal translations of the source material. I mean word for word, scene for scene. But in the previous movie, YEAR ONE, DC direct used voice over work to convey inner thought. Great idea, especially for comic book translations. The one thing I loved when I read the original graphic novel was the amazing thought boxes, the inner turmoil that Bruce was going through as he fought his way back. So many scenes of this movie needed those thoughts. Every time a scene would come up I could hear those thoughts in my head as they appeared in the book. (yes I owned the graphic novel for a while and read it a lot) All that being said, these are really good movie. They are so much better than that piece of crap DARKNIGHT RISES.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I realize that a single family can be hit by multiple tragedies, but Downton Abbey has so many tragic events that it's hard to not expect Lady Mary to get hit by a train.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Loved the look into the women's lives.  Loved the Aussie vocabulary-it kept me on my toes...<br />Absolutely crawled through the first third of this book with the too-frequent shifting of names and story lines.  Felt that it could have been done more simply while still toggling through the different main characters lives.<br />The last chapters a pleasure......
B0013TPV0Q|4.0|An easy and enjoyable read with the standard LOL sedaris moments. Not my fav of his but no less hilarious than Naked or Me Talk Pretty One Day.
B00BLSJI80|5.0|This album is great the songs are really catchy and Heart Attack and Nightingale really show off her singing voice.Heart attack,Made in the USA,Nightingale,really don't care and something that were not are the best by far.<br />BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Never have I anticipated a sequel as much as I did this one. &#34;The Shining&#34; was one of the scariest thrillers I've ever read, but this book was impossible to put down. Seeing Danny Torrance grown up, still shining and doing what he can to end the evil was amazing. The best part to me was the fact that the story gave more insight to his life and the life of other kids with the &#34;shine&#34; in them. If you like Stephen King, and were particularly fond of &#34;The Shining,&#34; you'll appreciate this book. If you have never read his work, &#34;The Shining&#34; and &#34;Sleep Doctor&#34; are a great place to begin.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|even though it left me very sad, I was enthralled with the characters.  Especially Clark.  Life is way to precious to<br />give into pain.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This was very enjoyable. The two stories intertwining was very interesting. I didn't want to put it down. Unbelievable that these two women went through so much and were able to come out better on the other end.
B002L5KKK2|5.0|Outstanding movie  DeNero  shares some pieces of his real story. His love for African American women. One of the best coming of age movies ever with great music.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Loved this book.....sorry to say I had steered clear of Mr. King's books in these last few years. Thanks to Entertainment Weekly magazine for publishing an excerpt from Doctor Sleep......I was hooked, bought the book and enjoyed it very much. Thank you very much, Mr. King!
B0071XO8RA|1.0|I really like science fiction, but this book is really boring.  I read 16% of the book before I finally gave up on the book due to pure boredom.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|What can I say about Firefly that has not already been said. By far my favorite television show since the first time I saw it. Character's are full of lovable nuances, and the story is truly epic.
B00280LYHS|5.0|An amazing story that everyone should read with humor and a bit of LOVE withholding edges all shark love this book.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|An excellent story from an excellent writer. He geniusly juxtaposes the lives of his characters, and keeps the reader constantly engaged.
B009OYSFDM|3.0|This was a good start.  I enjoyed many of the episodes and though the acting by Stephen Amell (the Green Arrow) seemed very stiff at the beginning as the story unfolds it makes more sense why he plays his part in the way he does.  look forward to next season.
B00DM7HAGA|5.0|I purchased this e-book based on other readers' reviews. Every page has very useful tips and guides in using the D7100. The tips are very easy to understand and follow. There are new things that I learned even on the basic things on photography like using the A,P,S,M modes. Great buy.
B000W94FIW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Very fast read and as always with Coelho, there is much to contemplate and learn from his characters.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This is a fantastic action/adventure movie, and Jennifer Lawrence is perfect for the part of Katniss Everdeen. She really owns the role. I can't see any other young actress portray that character like she does. I wasn't expecting a lot from this movie, but my mind has changed now. I can't wait for the other three. This movie ranks right up there with the very first Indiana Jones and other similar shows. I can watch this over and over.
B00B2FLDRQ|4.0|Enjoyable and fun book, loved Don, who makes for a completely unpretentious and unexpected hero. Lucky Rosie!  Very different read.
B003CH9PV8|1.0|Seriously. Amazon finds it wholey acceptable to show meth production, murder and a wide swath of crime, but no swearing. The show is fine but for Amazon to make such a perverse decision for their viewers is beyond comprehension. Are they saying so long as you clean up the language the show is suitable for kids or are they saying adults shouldn't have to listen to foul language while they enjoy a jaunt into methland? Weird and idiotic reasoning.
B00A3NQNUU|2.0|I love the game and spent months playing it, used kindle fire. After a few months however it stopped opening on kindle and gives pop-up that error has been reported. When first got smart phone about yr ago was able to play on it for few months then same thing. Hadn't played in about eight months. Yesterday was able to load on phone so downloaded on kindle fire but still getting error msg and black screen. Would love to give better rating but disused need to be fixed first.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|Doctor Who is solid science fiction that doesn't take itself too seriously. True to British style, there is plenty of humor. What I especially like is that the show doesn't try to explain how things work or sometimes why they work, like the Doctor's sonic screwdriver. I am not familiar with th classic Doctor Who, so I don't have an expectation for the show based on the classic. I rate this with four stars to say that I really like the show, but it doesn't quite make my my all-time favorite list.
B008MM9630|2.0|update for kindle and bring back offers for crystals. I mean I play this on google and its way better. please fix
B00ARI9CDQ|1.0|Once again, to much information, BBC, format is much easier, when you read a number of news sites, you get in and get<br />Out, BBC  makes this easy
B00FEHXCIG|1.0|Would have rather read an iron man comic. Total cliche / one liner / tech movie. Story was ridiculous. Would have stopped watching but I am on a road trip with nothing to do. Save for a rainy day; otherwise, do smoething productive with 3 hours.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really liked the author's writing skill.  The ending was sad but probably the only outcome option based on the personalities of the characters.  It held my attention until the end.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I like the different clocks you can choose from and it displays the weather,temperature,wind speed of your location,alot better than I expected with more options.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Quite moving...could not put this book down.  Really hit home with me and has give me renewed energy to resume the search for the child I gave up at age 16.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|This game should get 4 star's it an awesome game for little kid or for older . I also liked the animation. But when I was little I played with littles pet shops from the time I was 3 to now get this game it's awesome
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I just started playing and it seems pretty good so far. It uses creativity in hiding the objects. Also it seems to tell you what new item are used for.
B000FBJF3M|5.0|Harris weaves mystery, history and the lives of fictional characters together to make a very readable book which also will enlighten the reader about the events surrounding the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in 79 AD.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I love to watch the weather! So when I open my kindle fire to check what the weather is going to do it's right there. NO searching for it!
B008EEZ64Y|1.0|I ordered this book on June 27th for my daughter's summer reading.  I received it finaly on July 22m 4 days before her summer was over.  Shipping was not free either.  Why did it take so long?  Who knows?  The shipper does not communicate with you.  Never buying from this shipper again.
B00D6B4PUG|5.0|It makes it easy to go righto my e-mail. It keeps track of all my alerts and helps me to get to what is important.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|It kept me guessing, and it treated the dilemma in a very human way, no easy answers! I really enjoyed reading it.
B00D6SBOWG|4.0|Once I started playing I had a hard time stopping.  I'm still playing the free part and will probably purchase the full version.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Easy to use on Fire and I like that I can check the radar to see how far away an approaching storm is.
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|Way over the top with its story line.  Too glitzy, too long, too um.... Leonardo has done a lot better!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|great mystery! Very well thought out. felt very realistic and even a little spooky at times.  will definitely play more games by this company.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|I really didn't care for this second GI Joe movie.  Killed off most of the characters in the first five minutes of the show.
B0036S4B6M|3.0|I appreciate the honest account of Kerman's personal experience serving a short federal prison sentence.  Having worked at a female state prison for several years, I was interested in things from the other side.  While I do agree with some of Kerman's critiques, I also found her assessment uneven and one-sided.<br /><br />I have not yet seen the net flicks show based on this book, but I believe the show has a strong sense of humor.  The book does not.<br /><br />Still, this was a raw and unflinching account.
B00F35B8F8|4.0|Very well done,good plot, great graphics. Views well in HD. I never got bored. Would recommend it to a friend.
B00DGN51O8|3.0|Watched this as a family movie one night. It was entertaining but probably not a movie I'll add to the digital collection.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I'm not joking. This may be the best cast, written, directed and produced (especially for it's budget) TV series of all time.  i marvel at the richness of the writing and it's movie finale SERENITY is the same.<br /><br />Clearly creator Joss Whedon has either been poisoned by success in Marvel's SHIELD - or the studio suit have ruined his genius.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|I thought the movie was entertaining and fun to watch. I was a bit upset in the beginning when the movie was black an white (which I expected as it was in the original), but mostly I was pissed at the screen size (3:4 format). But when Oz makes it out of the storm and everything turns color, the screen slowly widens.<br /><br />Slow start to the movie but it picks up pace and turns out to be pretty entertaining. Some sketchy acting here and there and you have to do a little thinking to connect the director's interpretation of the connections to Wicked and The original Oz, but overall at the end, it was a cool movie to watch and visually entertaining.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Read this life story of Adam Brown and be inspired to live life with honor, respect & love for others, family & friends and experience genuine faith in God by an elite sinner - Seal - and Saint! Thank you for allowing us into your lives! Godspeed.
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|Sorry I can's take time to give you a good review, It seems that I have spent so much time playing this addictive game that I can not take the time to tell you how good it is..... (its really great)
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|This game is great to play on my Kindle.  When I'm too tired to read I can work on my park!  It's interesting juggling expansion vs. acquiring wealth.  The &#34;code red&#34; challenge every so often keeps it interesting!
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|I love this app it works great and does everything I need so I can work on my computers without being right with it so when I am fixing one computer and I need to reference back on my computer I can connect to my computer and not have to stop
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Well written with good story line.  Looking forward to next book in series.<br /><br />Hope others enjoy like I did. George
B0093QHWLC|5.0|I watched this movie because I love all the actors in it. Never heard of it. I was quite surprised when it turned out to be a tear jerked! I've watched it twice and recommended it to all my friends. It's a &#34;real life&#34; story.<br />Linda in NJ
B0030ZOYHC|4.0|While this movie was great and I'm a happy owner, I have to say there is a significant flaw in this package...<br /><br />On the box it clearly states it includes a 20 page guidebook.  The problem is, it does not.  Super lame.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|It's been a long time since I've watched an entire series of a show, but I got hooked on this one!
B005OUHOLY|4.0|This is a thoughtful and worthwhile book. The author quotes extensively from &#34;The Sufi Message of Hazrat Inayat Khan The Mysticism of Sound, Music, The Power of the Word, Cosmic Language&#34; which is a must read for the more adventurous. He has distilled some of the truisms in this book and added his own.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|I loved this book! Can't wait for her others. She did an excellent job of \\"thinking\\" like a man. I laughed until I cried. Job well done Emma!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is soooooooooo awesome that why yhis is so coll that's why I picked thnis app for kindlefire so
B005ZB91KY|5.0|Great show if your a Marvel fan. Does not disappoint. Lots of action, great story line and really good acting. Wstch this movie.
B001PP9ALY|5.0|This is my second time biuying this movie. I let my friend borrow the first one and she never gave it back. Well let's just we arnt friends anymore.<br /><br />This movie is really good. Similar to a Fairytale like Cinderella with Whitney Houston and The Forbidden<br />Kingdom with Jet Li and Jackie Chan.<br /><br />It's one of those pick me up fairy tales I wished happend to me. Where a person come and pick you up and save you:Well if you don't pick yourself up from my present situation.  All in All a 5star.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|My granddaughter enjoys cutting, coloring, and blow drying the customer's hair.  It is fun to watch her enjoy the game.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|I enjoyed it.  Play at your leisure.  This game goes back and forth between scenes and takes a little time.  But it's worth it.  I'm glad I had the time.
B002DCLQOW|5.0|one gets caught up with the charming community of stars hollow and can't stop watching it ... it's healthily addictive
B005MLOKXA|5.0|My wife and I love this show.  She normally hates lawyer shows because they're usually preposterous.  Not The Good Wife. It is incredibly well written and very well acted.
B002ZG975Q|5.0|Loved the movie and especially the blonde male co-star! Very well directed & produced! Such a great romantic movie! Perfect!
0385535147|5.0|Arrived quickly and in condition as promied.  Though I have not read it yet, my husband has, and you know you just can't go wrong with John Grisham!!
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Neil Gaiman revisits a few old acquaintance's from the SANDMAN.  Who is that living in the house at the end of the lane?  What is the attraction of the little pond at the end of the lane?  For lovers of Fantasy of all ages.
B000AJIF4E|4.0|I have a small head, and I have to pull the headband ALL the way up to use this because the weight of it is so heavy it's hard on my neck.  Especially if you're working for long periods of time.  It does have very good sound quality, and I'm not sure how you could make these things more comfortable - to be over ear they have to be big, big means heavy I guess.  I don't trust blue tooth, I really wanted plug-in.  If you have neck issues, I'd say pay the extra money and get a more expensive pair that claims to be light weight.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I can not put this game down. I love it so much. sometimes it is slow but other than that its great!
B00821OX98|5.0|Love it.  Only seen the first 3 episodes though.  I only hope the rest is as good as the start.
B00CATSONE|3.0|This is an absolutely brilliant book and was absolutely worthwile reading. I gripped from the very beginning by the action and fast pace of the book. This is a truly remarkable story.
B00C6C6G8K|5.0|I had to watch this film for a German Cinema class that I am taking and I have to say that this is one of the most interesting films we have watched. It took us through many different scenarios following the same people and kind of gave off that fantasy vibe. You don't know what actually happened but it gives you the ending that you want.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I am not a huge Star Trek fan but the last two movies have really re-energized the franchise.  No pun intended.  Excellent plot,  cinematography, and good acting. Sound effects were great on the 7.1 surround system.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|Anyone who mucks about with those who cannot bleat is a hero. Watch this show it will change your life.
B009P5S11G|5.0|Once I started playing the CD I could not stop.  When you only have to skip one song on a cd, thats a pretty good buy.  The DVD was ok.
B00FF56IR4|4.0|I greatly enjoyed this. It was much more lighthearted than I expected, having just finished catching up on the show Arrow. However this is not a detriment. Arrow lacks in humor. Agents of Shield lack grittiness, at least in the first show.<br />That is the sole downside to the show after the first episode. The danger was not enough. You never wondered how they should get out of this situation and honestly the story was more bringing the team together. In fact the only thing I wonder about is how this array of characters will gel.<br />However they set up the ability to explore a number of story lines. We have four characters who clearly have backgrounds that shall be examined.<br />I love the wit. It gives hope that the great combination of drama and humor of the Avengers can be built upon. I also love the fact that there are as many women as men.<br />The special affects seem perfect for the show.<br />The show started out with minimal vulgarity and suggestiveness. The characters are familiar types with the promise that they can be unique. The acting is good.<br />This is a good start for the show. I recommend it if you enjoyed Avengers, or the shows Eureka and Warehouse 13.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Good cliff hanger-thought someone different was going to be at the door.  Acting well done.  Calinda is a complex character.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|The actors in this movie are wonderful together.  I enjoy this movie so much I have seen it 4 times.  Can't wait to see the next one.
B00AZ7V0W0|4.0|This is a great product to have if you are a nightmare on elm street fan it has all 7 movies on blue ray which look great. I have only 1 complaint (and the only reason for not giving this 5 stars) WTF were the makers of this collection thinking? why oh why on the bonus disc with the 2 episodes of freddy's nightmares do you not have the pilot episode (the best episode of the series btw!? It was directed by Tobe Hooper one of the best horror directors in history...This episode tells the origins of freddy with him getting off at trial, to the parents burning him in the boiler room to how he started invading dreams. Plus Robert England is in the entire episode as the burned and unburned version of freddy. Shame on them for this oversight, its like on the Friday blue ray box set not putting the unrated version of jason goes to hell in there intstead of the theatrical version. Another oversight, Cmon guys details, details, details. Pay attention to these little things!
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|The plot was rather predictable, the actors were stiff.  Appeared more like themselves rather than the character they were supposed to be playing
0385394233|3.0|I think Sheryl missed the mark.<br /><br />She lived an upscale, privileged life and therefore doesn't really connect with the majority of women out there. She had all the right stars align in her favor with a lot of the right people taking her under their wing. And most of us don't have a &#34;nanny&#34; to lean on as we lean in at work.<br /><br />Totally not impressed. but it was great for our book club as it generated a lot of discussion.
0316017930|5.0|Great book. my 12 year old had to read this for her summer reading and she really enjoyed it.  I couldn't find it anywhere locally so I was really pleased to find it here at such a great price.
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|After they had done so well with this series, this one was awful to sit through.<br />Bruce Willis phoned his acting in and the father/son relationship story was beyond bad.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I did love the first half of the book b ut  got weary of the soap opera story that followed, I am a huge fan of Hosseini so was disappointed .
B00F6HOW4M|4.0|Lyrics as usual keep you hanging on his every word, the beats are hot, oozes intelligence, a certain melancholy, and honesty. And he does it all with swag. Personal faves: Own It, Connect, Too Much, Furthest Thing and Wu-Tang Forever. And Worst Behaviour. Yeah, pretty much the whole album :)
B00DGNO3WE|2.0|Stopped viewing it after 5 minutes.  Was not what I anticipated.  Don't waste your time on this one.  Save your money
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved it how she make the people stand out in it mind and I relate so much to katness and love the character and wish she would write a book twenty five years after like how katness's life is and her kids life is after the fall of the capital!
B00EVCD9HY|3.0|Too many interludes... thought there would be more upbeat dance tracks. Overall, truly a good album, just not what I expected.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is different from most American television. It is captivating and entertaining. It is well produced and acted, very worthy of the prices and recognition it has obtained. Highly recommend it.
B00280LYIC|5.0|THE BEST BOOK I'VE EVER READ. MUST BUY SEA OF MONSTERS!!! Ugh it's just so good! I love it so much!
B005544V6A|5.0|This show is funny and witty. Both main characters are highly likable. The production is entertaining and positive. Highly recommend it.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Quick and easy to read, one I started it Ii couldn't putnitndown. Excellent storyline and characters. Quite eye opening because I was not aware of the orphan trains in the 1930s. I didn't want it to end.
B000ZHBB0Q|5.0|This movie is fun to watch, I did with my teenage grandsons. The subject is a bit grownup, however if it is watch with supervision it can teach a few good lessons.
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|I give it 5 stars because this album is excellent from beginning to end. Great music, great lyrics, this band is one of the best in the genre. To put a product like this out after so much controversy and hardships is amazing. I recommend it to any & everyone.
B00DBISUWS|4.0|Goldfrapp's sixth studio album `Tales of Us' is a fine and mature piece of work, possibly their best. Though it can sound on a casual first pass like a background muzak soundscape, repeat listening reveals the album to be a delicate mood piece with Alison's subdued and breathy vocals delivered with a finesse matched by the sensitive and imaginative instrumental work of Will Gregory. Orchestral strings feature in the arrangements as often as synthesizers.<br /><br />The song titles are one-worders, each a person's name. The tunes are rather traditional in structure, delicate and uncomplicated but the whole effect adds up to something special, each song building on the mood of the last. Like watching a film composed of different scenes, each adding to the story, the album works best when listened to as a whole from beginning to end.<br /><br />Party music this is not, but for the early hours of the morning, or for afternoon contemplation, it's perfect. True it may not be to everyone's taste, but it may be to yours. Give it a listen.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I had such high hopes for this book & was very disappointed. Who were all these characters & why were they part of the same book? The whole Tess/Felicity/Will storyline just didn't fit in at all. The way Polly's injury seemed to compensate for Janie's death was lame. Don't think I would recommend this one.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  John Green is a great writer and does an excellent job of making his characters very real.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time!  A great feel good story, i reccomend it to all.
B00C5R8364|5.0|I literally could not put this book down.  Starts well and picks up speed until the political regulations become a nightmare .  It's surprising our military can be so effective with their hands seemingly tied by politicians.  Great insight into the Muslim life.  Ray
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I started this book Friday night and could not put it down until I finished.  The ending was totally unpredicted but realistic.  A wonderful read.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book addresses many issues and makes you think about how you would react in certain situations.Much food for<br />Thought.
B009O2XY12|2.0|I really liked this game until I ran out of what I needed to continue.  I either had to buy (which I choose not to do)  or wait until time passed & I could get some more.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book opens one's mind to the endless possibilities that life has to offer. Given the chance to change your mind & expand your lens to believe in bountiful abundance.
B008AIGWVA|3.0|My 3 y/o great granddaughter likes when he repeats what she says.  I like when he burps. It's a cute game for little ones to get used to the tablets.
0316201545|5.0|THIS BOOK WAS A PERFECT 2ND BOOK IN THE SERIES.  I CANT WAIT TILL HE WRITES MORE!! SO GOOD I LOVE IT
B00F8L2VO4|4.0|I gave it 4 stars because it's easy to use, but I don't know how to pronounce the words.  I have a grandson & great granddaughter in Germany & I so want to learn to talk to them in their language.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Rented this movie at redbox. Didn't want to give up to the amazon price. Don't think any movie is worth 13 bucks.<br /> Anyhow, whatever you pay for the movie, you will likely enjoy it and laugh out loud. If you like sports, gambling, dancing, laughing, and feeling good, this movie will take you there. Don't let the negative reviews guide you.
B0096DFBZQ|2.0|I don't know what I was expecting but I sure didn't get what I hoped I would.  The game may have it's good qualities but not for me.
B00CM4VC7M|5.0|She came in yesterday and I can't stop playing with her. First, I'm 21 years old and I've been a fan of Sailor Moon since I was 5. This toy is the best thing that has ever happened to me! She's super posable (you can even rotate her pigtails and Luna's head and tail! ) and the interchangeable parts equals to hours of fun. I would love to see a few more face options though, but maybe they'll make add on sets? I hope so because I think a open mouth happy face, closed mouth sad face, no tiara open mouth, and maybe a winking crying face would be really cool. Either way I adore this doll. She's smaller than I expected, (about 6 inches tall) but she's so well detailed that it's worth the money. I'm so excited for the other scouts. I hope they do all the scouts plus, Chibi Moon, Tuxedo mask, and Artemis with the Venus figure. The dolls motion and changeable parts are stiff at first but after moving her around and changing her face and hands a few times everything loosens up and becomes quick and easy. I can't express how much I love her!
B00DJWV11I|5.0|This isn't some flowery love sap story. It's real, refreshing and raw. I love a book that can tell a story and make me believe that it's real and not some oversexed and scripted fake babble crap. The author is amazing at telling a story and bent real with it. Great characters and great details during the sexy parts lol. I think ppl will really appreciate this book because it's not just some love story it has a lot of life lessons and advice we all need.
B001974DG0|5.0|This was a wonderful read. Good enough to keep you wondering what's going to happen next when you have to put the book down, which was hard to do, by the way.
B00F35BV64|5.0|the jibes about Khan redux don't hold with me.<br />I like the parallel universe and the people in it.<br />It was good action, good character, fine effects.. very much<br /> a good watch!
B0074VTHKM|5.0|It's the Gresham Grisham I enjoy, made accessible to my son. We're reading it together and hands eating it up.
B00EB6F1TY|4.0|seems like an attempt to grow more appeal for jr. hs. kids.<br />in fact, I don't even remember much about it now.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|very useful to help you get rid of unwanted files. to get more space in the device. moving files to sd has not been possible...
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Very different from his other best sellers.<br />I learned a lot about different cultures.<br />Very engaging, and thought provoking. Good read.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Everything is right there for you to see at a glance.  You see your battery time, as well as how much time your battery has left  for music, videos, YouTube, etc. I really like the graphics:)
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Love the game<br /><br />fun to play. addictive. can't stop trying to get better/faster. fun to see how far I go.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|This app is awesome I am so glad I got it. I highly recommend you get this game. It is really great
B0010T75W6|5.0|Simply one of the best musicals out there !! Hedwig may only have an inch, but delivers a MILE !
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I absolutely loved this book, and I will recommend it to my friends. I am surprised, that I actually cried though. I rarely cry for anything. This book made me fall in love with the characters, and cry when one was lost. I cried from the second he told her, to the end of the book. Beautiful, heart wrenching book.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love this series.  Accurate historically.  This part is set in the 1920's England and the aristocracy is having to adapt to changing times.  Servants are demanding more rights and the mores of certain things such as childbirth, homosexuality and prostitution are discussed in new lights.  Fashion is changing also with the dress length continuously rising.  The vast estate is undergoing an income slump and figuring out how to bring in more money to keep the lifestyle presents problems.
B001QL5MAA|5.0|Very engaging...if you include the short stories this is a very long series. I love alternative universe/time line &#34;future opera&#34;....this is very well thought out and detailed...so much so it will take you getting thru at least one book before you start to get a grasp of all the involved subplots and story lines. I also suggest you go to Wiki and look up &#34;revelation space universe&#34; for background and suggestions for reading in chronological order....enjoy!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was a great book for my book club, not just for YA! Must read if you know someone with cancer.
B0035HKWLW|5.0|This movie was made when Jim Carrey was at his prime, and extremely funny.  Although I've seen it a 100 times, I still find it very entertaining. I recommend it!
B00DMEQP46|2.0|Its a pretty terrible album, the best song is only 2 minutes long. I will never buy any of this fake trash pop rocks band's music ever again, simply pathetic....
B005K17RU0|2.0|this used to be a good app, but over the years they have added too many confusing features. wish they'd go back about a year...
B0042JTDXK|5.0|Another awesome CD from an amazing voice.  I love listening to it and a welcome addition to my Groban collections.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows.  It is a sci fi drama but always used humor.  If you are looking for a fun show that is very entertaining this is the show.
B000I5X81K|5.0|I loved the CD.  Another awesome CD for my Groban collection.  I love listening to his voice.  It takes me to a comforting place.
B00F2J2LRE|5.0|Cher is definitely back!!  Her vocals are wonderful and the music choices suit her voice.  I am very impressed with this CD and would recommend it to anyone!!!
B00785P2QC|4.0|I like Virtual City Playground so far, it's a nice game, the only thing I don't like is that there's an energy bar that limits you on how much you can do for a period of time.
B003U4UPHG|2.0|Excellent premise for the show, great potential. Very poor execution: bad script, very unrealistic characters. Just a bunch of idiots with severe emotional problems. Paradise for a shrink, except they can’t pay. Writers are dragging this on for 6 seasons for a paycheck.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I am addicted to this game I recommend for  ages seven to seventy years spool awesome blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
B00DTDFSES|5.0|What an intense and gripping read, full of so much emotion, you'll feel bereft once you turn the final page!<br />I have to admit that this is the first Colleen Hoover book that I've ever read, I've heard of her before and know of her books but had yet to pick one up before being sent Hopeless to review.<br />But after reading this book which deserves all the praise and hype that it has and still is receiving, I will definitely be hunting down all of her other books as well, which unsurprisingly  seem to be as popular and loved as Hopeless, and after reading this book and seeing the talent that is Colleen I can see why.<br />I haven't read too many books in the New Adult genre, but what I have read including this masterpiece here will have me immersing myself in as many books as I can find, while wondering why it's taken so long for this genre to really take off like it has in the last year or so.<br />Sky and Holder make for one unforgettable couple, it's this plus the fantastic, heartbreaking and shocking plot that raises the bar for other New Adult books being released.<br />The story of both characters are so emotionally draining that you feel yourself in despair at what Sky especially has had to endure in her life and the tie that she has with Holder is a surprise twist I guess you could say, that really gives this book a life of it's own.<br />Once started this book will grip you until you lose track of time and whatever's going on around you.<br />I can't recommend this book enough, definitely pick this up you won't be disappointed!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|.......................................................very cool. Combination of subway surfers and many other games. It's awesome in short and very FREE although in-app purchases are available.
0307477479|1.0|I agree with all the one star reviewers. This woman's writing is overloaded with sophomoric metaphors and so many adjectives, and dangling participles that slogging through gave me a headache. The judges who voted a Pulitzer ought to cut back on their Doritos intake.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|Worst game ever since the day my brother was born. Some people gave this 5 stars there probably blind and if there not go to the eye doctor
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|This game is fun, but I don't understand how to keep going on the next level when it goes to
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|This game is challenging but it's still sweet  I love it no one can live without it my friend reported this to me and I am going to go buy her some chocolates
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We need more show like this, not only do you learn some history, but a great story. I love this show.
B009NFHF0Q|1.0|Started it, got to (I can't even say it), stopped there, wish I could erase it from my brain and my Kindle. Sorry, but I have a phobia; my problem.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|Clear and concise. A thoughtful demolition of the mythology that has given rise to so much of the violence, bigotry and discrimination in the world today.
B004YXE438|5.0|Super easy to navigate, not hard to use at all. Just a simple puzzle game that you can use your own pictures in as well as their stock photos. Love it!!
B00846F1YW|2.0|Time is too short for this one.  You have to touch the screen to move the light and that changes the work you have done.  Completely stuck with no way to bypass like others.  VERY frustrating.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game! It's simple at first but then you have to start really thinking where the lines join up. Really addictive!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I missed this show in 2002.  I did not learn of it until a couple of weeks ago.  Watching the first episode I was hooked.  This show is great.  Best of all, its heroes are people I would actually like and would invite into my home if they were real people.  This is a show where the good guys win.  It is extremely well written and the special effects are great.  I'm so sorry this show was cancelled after the first season - what a tragedy. I only wish they were making shows like this one today.
B00594XOZU|5.0|This is a good app to download,, it is a easy way to keep in contact with family and friends.
B00ADS98FC|4.0|Love this movie and now with the convenience of watching it anywhere, makes it just that much better. Great one for a good laugh and a stroll down memory lane with all of its good music.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|If you like Inspector Lynley, you will love this show. You really get involved with this story. Great plot and character development.
B0094KTCUQ|4.0|Love this movie and the fact that now we can view it just about anywhere now (from our instant library) makes it even cooler!
B0081336FO|5.0|Love this series - attention grabbing style, terrific writing, great acting and modernized take on old stories. I could watch this over and over. I love the modern day Watson- much more believable than his bumbling old fashion self. And Moriarty? Incomparably creepy. Good stuff, well worth the time and money.
B00ELD3MUW|5.0|I purchased an Asus Nexus 7 with the desire to run my GoPros and watch Amazon Prime movies. Turns out, the GoPro app works well, but Amazon Prime needs Adobe Flash Player to work. Big problem for Android machines. Not so with this app. I checked the \\"security\\" box and downloaded this. In about 2 minutes I had Adobe Flash Player installed and was watching Amazon movies. This product is going to be very popular.
0452295548|4.0|(3.5 stars) This book details the experiences of the author, a neuroanatomist, when she had a stroke at 37. There are several short chapters that give an overview of brain anatomy and function, but most of the novel details the actual event of the stroke, and her long pathway to recovery. She talks about how her thought function changed when one hemisphere of her brain was essentially silent, and how that has changed how she is as a person as she works to use the strengths of both sides of her brain in a more holistic fashion. She also gives some important advice on how to communicate and relate to someone recovering from stroke. This is a short, but perceptive look at stroke and the brain.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|I have read all the Jack Reacher books.  They are still wonderful when you get to the action parts but now there is way too much filler.  I scanned more pages than I read.  Wish the author would 're-read some of his earlier novels and go back to that kind of writing.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|Like all card games there is a learning curve. But it's worth giving a shot. It's not too little kiddish.<br /><br />If you know what I mean.
B00FEHXCIG|2.0|The third part is much worse that the previous two. I regret about the time and money spent. I wouldn't recommend buying this movie to anyone. Better go and grab some coffee.
B00E6F15HM|5.0|4+ stars.<br /><br />The core of this 2 disc set is Gabriel performing in Athens Greece in October of 1987 (supposedly the \\"full show\\", but probably culled from a multi date set),and it is a really great concert - a great band, great set list, and great audience - despite the dated clothing/appearances on stage - lol. I especially like that it is Gabriel as his dramatic self, but without all the elaborate yet somewhat distracting props that were soon to come (see [[ASIN:B00008977N Peter Gabriel - Secret World Live]]). This show alone would be enough reason to get this DVD, but the real bonus for me is that Youssou N'Dour was with him.<br /><br />The concert disc begins with N'Dour and his Senegalese band Le Super Etoile De Dakar as the warm up act with a set of 5 vibrant songs, that are a nice contrast to the slick PG show that follows. I think this is the first concert DVD I've ever seen that also shows the warm up band! Youssou is at the beginning of his meteoric rise here. He would on go to become an even more popular and famous performer than Gabriel (in 2004 Rolling Stone described him as \\"perhaps the most famous singer alive\\", I'd also add that he is perhaps in the top handful of the greatest vocalists alive). The inclusion of Youssou's set is a real treat, and having him and some of his band join PG for the last 2 songs of the main concert are the highlights of that show (the 15+ minute version of \\"In Your Eyes\\" is quite remarkable).<br /><br />Disc 2 is another great bonus; Gabriel's 23 music videos from 1980 to 2004. Gabriel always has had a reputation for theatrics and top quality production, and these videos show an abundance of creativity. They may not be the kind of thing you want to watch very often but they are nice to have - and express an era (early MTV) well.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I like what I like. I am not a film critic, but the series appeals to me. Can't wait until Season 3 appears on Amazon Prime.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|A great Friday night movie and I am not a &#34;zombie&#34;movie fan. More of a science movie, really. Good choice ...
B00CL68BK2|5.0|My husband and I both loved this movie.  Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Copper are fantastic actors.  They did an amazing job of portraying people with mental illness.  We highly recommend this movie!

B008220D7S|1.0|I like to think I'm fair minded, but watching someone using their Ipad in the bathroom, having his wife checking his hemmorhoids - come on! There's bathroom humor and then there is disgusting. The film went nowhere.

0131103628|5.0|I started programming with micros a little while ago.  I started my programming life with C++ and as such there was some holes in my pure C ability to code.  This book help me not just understand the syntax but it gives a perspective and philosophy to help mold the way a programmer should attempt to solve the programming problems.  This has been one of the best programming books I have owned.  I would highly recommend it.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book was one I could not put down. The first few chapters  introduced you to the characters and then began weaving the plot to bring all the characters together. Had a few twists and turns I did not anticipate and brought the conclusion to a satisfactory end. I would highly reccomend to anyone.

B00CM4VC7M|5.0|_____When I pre-ordered my first one_____<br />Got her in perfect condition, amazon could have packaged it better, especially being a collectors item. Packaging had only 2 pocket airbags on the left and right side of the box but no foam wrap.<br />All and all, paint job is beautiful, there will always be minor errors but it did not leave me in upset. Mostly around the boots and the skirt. Faces are brilliant! See common reviews of lunas crescent off center but mine was spot on.<br /><br />_____When I ordered after release_____<br /><br />I hear when you pre-order you get the extra faceplate and Luna, well I pre-ordered my first one via Amazon and it was great!<br /><br />I wanted to get a second one but did not have the funds then, even with the long wait we had to pre-order. Anyway, so I gave up my nerves to buy a second one in hopes to still getting the extra faces and Luna and I did! I dunno if it was cause I got her a few days after it was released but wow so happy! Now I have one in the box and one outside =)<br /><br />I noticed though when I did the 2 to 3 day shipping the packaging did come with a thin foam wrap, compared to my regular shipping on my first figure, dunno if this was coincidence or not. But overall, got here safely, no damage, lovely paint job with some minor factory issues, but this is common. Simply perfect!
B002SHD9E2|5.0|I love this movie..I have seen it on stage around the world.It is well worth your time to see.I do have all the Phantom that are out on dvd at this time.
0393343405|5.0|This book is not for the light fiction reader.  It is philosophical nonfiction about the discovery of an old manuscript and the oppressive eras that tried to eradicate it.
B00DYWKPAQ|5.0|We all know every band has that one album they can never top. For Alter Bridge it was AB III, Creed was My Own Prison, Coheeed & Cambria was In Keeping With Secrets of Silent Earth 3, Default was Elocation, Alanis was Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie, Daughtry was Daughtry, Nickelback was Silver Side Up; I could go on and on and on....Here, we see Kings of Leon getting the closest ever to Only By The Night! The same notes and melodies are inherent here, you feel a sense of continuation from Only By The Night. I don't want to you to rush to track 8 because you might end up repeating it so much that you fail to listen to the rest of the album,or track 1, 2, 7, 8 (I said that already), 12. Every track here is awesome, you can't go wrong!
B00CY5Y37U|4.0|Great collection, gathered for the collector on 3 discs, including the many videos! Awesome. What I don't understand is that she did this with 3 other albums, and the prices range from $17 to $23 - they all have 3 discs, with album and single versions on one, remixes on disc two, and interview and/or videos - so why aren't they all marked at the same price point?! And only one is available as an MP3 download...It seems they marketed each one based on it's popularity, not what they paid for it!

B0019IIPXQ|2.0|Very dissapointed in this movie. Most in the production and cinematography. Not really concerned with the acting cause lets be real, who watches a Vin Dissel movie for the acting.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Fun game that relives the old school missile defenser arcade game. Good for all ages and easy to play. May end up being one  one of my favorite games.
B009LQKHIO|1.0|First, let's consider the good.  For a romance, the plot is fairly interesting.  Now, let's turn to the bad.  The characters are shallow, the dialogue is trite, and the description limited and repetitive.  This writer wouldn't know a complete sentence if she saw it.  Run-on sentences and grammar errors are the rule rather than the exception.  If this is really an Amazon best seller, too many people must be satisfied with incredibly poor writing.  I'm assuming this book must have been self-published because no self-respecting editor would ever pass this off as a finished product.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|Love this game!!! You really have to use ur brain to figure out how to make the vehichle pass. Some of the levels r so hard though.
B00DGNOMB6|3.0|Great acting, but the story is somewhat contrived.  It has a predictable plot that pulls at your emotional heart strings.

B009MYARIK|5.0|I've loved Sophie's work for years. This book is no exception. It's funny, witty, endearing and a bit suspenseful (I mean come on, are they going to have sex or not?!)
B00A285OOW|4.0|This is the same review as for White Princess, White Queen and Red Queen<br /><br />I enjoyed reading this series in quick succession and found myself wanting the next book that would hopefully bridge White Princess to the times of Henry VIII.  I skipped the book more focused on the Neville's since I wasn't sure I wanted one more perspective on the same period of time.
B0029LCJJS|4.0|A very good period drama and historical soap opera. Overall, very enjoyable and gripping; if you don't mind its departure from historical fact.
B000001DYA|5.0|The ultimate Sixties album, starting out with the blues-ed out, freaked-out version of “Summertime Blues”, the story just goes on and on and on. “Rock Me Baby” is a beautiful old rocker that gloms and gloms, it feels sweet and beautiful and full of wonderful mojo. Nice. Love Dick Peterson’s vocals here – one of the best in the industry! “Doctor Please” is a nutty blues song that just wails – not as heavy on the guitars with this one, but a great long solo attached, beautiful!!! Longest song on the album. “Out Of Focus” is some nice blues, not quite different from the previous two blues songs. Great blues shouting, nice solo, everything else sort of pasted together. The next song “Parchment Farm”, however, is a true classic, that just blueses on and on, while “Second Time Around” veers into the blues stratosphere. Nice stuff.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was hard to keep up with, got kinda slow at some parts, it was hard to not throw the book in anger when unread things that can't believe are true. But I'm glad I read it.
B00AFOS6QG|5.0|I jumped ahead and got the cloth-bound limited edition book with CD and DVD. The CD is the best part; the book is pretty good too, with reprints of Cave’s magnificent lyrics, for people who can’t make out what he’s saying (although actually it’s never too hard to make out what he’s saying). The DVD contains in-studio videos for songs that didn’t make it into the final cut.<br />In a way the DVD should be fascinating, with the fanboys trying to imagine where they might fit on the album, or why they were cut; the fact is, of course, that they were probably pulled simply because they don’t really fit on the album. It might also be because they aren’t very good. But it is nice to see Nick and friends in the studio, looking very serious indeed.<br /><br />The album is great, one of Cave’s best in recent years (actually, this isn’t really saying much – they’ve all been good); it starts with songs that are a bit over-produced, like “We No Who U R” (pretty), “Wide Lovely Eyes” (stark and simple, with pretty keyboards), and “Water’s Edge” (a weirdly unsatisfying story about whorish DC chicks), although the latter ends on a great note with the lyrics “It’s the will of love, it’s the thrill of love, but it’s the chill of love that’s coming down – people!”.<br /><br />The album really picks up with “Jubilee Street”, a wild storytelling song about hookers – the song really cooks. Great vocal phrasings by Cave (including a Beggars Banquet era Jagger-esque “I’ve got a foetus… on a LEASH”), cool sparse guitar and jazzy percussion, before the swelling violin sounds kick in. Nice. He mentions a “10 ton catastrophe on a 60 pound chain”, wonder what that is. There’s good insanity in the final line – “I am an embryo eating dark oxygen. I am glowing. I am flying. Look at me now.” Crazy stuff. Nice build up to the end too, with the children’s choir bits (more Beggars Banquet era Stones-copying there too, actually…). “Mermaids” is a fun, tense little charmer, but the really good one is “We Real Cool”, with its weird reference to the distance of the stars, great Nick Cave roamings and groanings. “Finishing Jubilee Street” is a cool meta-songwriting exercise, memory ramble, a wild combo of moody music, talking, singing, and a wonderful children’s choir. Nice. The standout piece on the album is “Higgs Boson Blues”, a weird piece of Geneva melancholia that starts off like the Stones classic “Sister Morphine”; it is also the longest song on the album, nearly eight minutes. The lyrics sheet – which you need to read to understand what the hell he’s babbling about, with references to “mummified cats” and all – spreads out over four pages even! The final song on the album is probably the best – quite a feat, since “Higgs Boson Blues” should be pretty hard to top. It’s the title track and is dominated by Cave’s voice and a spooky church organ (there’s a bit of drum going on there too). Lovely.<br /><br />Overall, this is one randy album, with Cave referencing bimbos, girlfriends, Hannah Montana (and Mylie Cyrus), black patches, and a lot of girls.<br /><br />The two songs on the DVD are “Needle Boy” and “Lightning Bolts “. Both show the musicians playing their parts, with lyrics running along the side (they don’t appear in the booklet). “Needle Boy” is tinted red and is about a needle boy and all of the little objects he possesses, and musically it’s just Jim’s weird organ stuff and Nick’s lyrics. Nick is wearing a polo shirt and dancing dramatically in front of the mic. Warren Ellis is messing around with a mess of pedals and effects boxes that litter a persian rug in the studio, and at one point is grinding away on his trademark violin. The song ends in weird studio noise. “Lightning Bolts” is visually similar to “Needle Boy”, but it’s set in green. And while both songs are fairly sparse in arrangement, this song is faster and more electronic, with plenty of weird noises. It shows Nick working the mic again with his weird studio dance, Warren and producer Nick Launay in the control room, Warren playing a flute that is miced up to sound like an angel’s choir (or is it a stunt?), and then the Bad Seeds at the mic singing the backing vocals (it’s probably staged – I doubt that this song was recorded live). The song is interesting, a surreal tale of Nick’s encounter with Zeus over a pramful of lightning bolts.<br /><br />The cloth-bound booklet is cool, with pages of type-written lyrics with blackened-out sections (our mind wanders – what words did those sections contain?), and great pictures of the band interacting; I particularly like the one that faces “Finishing Jubilee Street”, showing Nick walking with Warren Ellis and listening to something that he’s saying, Jim’s hand gesture expressive in its own way. A bit of fantasy there too – I wonder what they’re talking about and if it’s fascinating, or if it’s just a bit of boring junk.his song is faster and more electronic, with plenty of weird noises.

B000002P72|5.0|Starting with the words \\"Ladies and gentlemen, how about a nice, warm round of applause to welcome the world's greatest blues singer, the king of the blues, BB King,\\" the band launches right into \\"Every Day I Have The Blues\\", with the full drum and horns, before that silky guitar sound glides over us, giving way to that shouting of the title, twice, and then the verses. Magic.<br /><br />The album is known for lots of great stage banter, and whooping by audience members during songs (great audience interplay here!), and BB King invites it all with his quaint onstage chat. \\"And now ladies and gentlemen, we would like to go back and sort of reminisce just a little bit, and pick up some of the real old blues. If we should happen to play one that you should remember, let us know by making some noise.\\" This was recorded on November 21st, 1964, and for us to hear it now, BB's \\"real old blues\\" from the perspective of now would make that \\"real real real old blues.\\" Many of the songs run together beautifully, and there are a few very short songs, like \\"Woke Up This Mornin' (My Baby's Gone)\\". The horn section is great, and very very tight.<br /><br />Considered one of the great blues albums of all time (despite BB King's relatively low consideration of it; allmusic.com notes that it is \\"A high point, perhaps even the high point, for uptown blues.\\"), the Wikipedia notes that some musicians, including Eric Clapton, John Mayer, and Mark Knopfler, have acknowledged using this album as a primer before performances. It's also rated as one of the best BB King albums; time may have been a bit less kind to the album, and I'd think that BB King's renditions of his songs on the Rolling Stones' Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out album were a bit more energetic and sound better. Of course, that recording doesn't include all of the songs that are on this, and on Live At The Regal you can hear wonderful moments like BB King's speech and interlude in \\"Sweet Little Angel.\\" \\"How Blue Can You Get\\" roars and rollicks, with some rocking crowd support. \\"Worry, Worry\\" is full of great yelling and shouting and big BB King licks, horns, great great rhythm and blues!!! \\"You Done Lost Your Good Thing Now\\" starts off with great guitar work, before those smooth vocals come in. Lovely.ollicks, with some rocking crowd support. \\"Worry, Worry\\" is full of great yelling and shouting and big BB King licks, horns, great great rhythm and blues!!! \\"You Done Lost Your Good Thing Now\\" starts off with great guitar work, before those smooth vocals come in.

B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|I play a lot off games on the Xbox, and this one is comparable to any racing game on that system! Getting used to the controls is probably the most difficult thing, but other than that, I give it a big thumbs up!! Gameloft, you are the Bom Diggitty!
B0057UA4FY|5.0|It's generally good, with interesting stories about the Battle of Ryloth, the hostage crisis. Master Yoda is overpowered, and there's a so-so ambush episode. The commentary from Dave Filoni is also quite good. There were generally lots of good episodes, I can recommend it.

B000002KB8|5.0|THE BAND: The best line-up of Black Sabbath:<br /><br />Ozzy Osbourne(Vocals)<br />Tony Iommi(Guitar)<br />Geezer Butler(Bass)<br />Bill Ward(Drums)<br /><br />THE SOUND:Good straight transfer,no volume maxing,limited only by digital equipment of the day.Great remastered.A rhythm section sounding as heavy as all hell.The vocals sound thin and all the attempted jazzy runs and smashing cymbals do my head in.<br /><br />THE TRACKS: Black Sabbath apparently wanted to create music that would have the effect of a horror movie.The band unconciously hit upon using trinitones in their music.It's a musical interval that spans three whole tones, apparently Iommi, like most of us, just thought that it sounded cool.In this CD they are clearly influenced by the BLUES.<br />FANTASY/MEDIEVAL/SATANIC/ LYRICS.<br /><br />-Black Sabbath:Truly a scary song,heavy riffs, and the ending once the songs in full flight, happily exciting<br /><br />-The Wizard:The rhythm section of Butler and Ward are truly heavy and thunderous here, blowing up sub-woofers the land over.Ozzy plays the harmonica.<br /><br />-Behind of Wall of Sleep:Is quite creepy for 1970,great song whit a friendly guitar riff.<br /><br />-N.I.B.:The style of the band encapsulated, the solo is scary and exciting, Ozzy sounds impassioned, the drums and bass both do their own thing and shining equally.<br /><br />-Wicked World:Whit a nice jazzy intro.You can pick out each and every band members part,isolate it,and just admire that.<br /><br />-Sleeping Village:Very dark and heavy tunes,change rhythm three times.<br /><br />-Warning:EPIC 10 minutes,Ozzy sings impressively throughout the opening,we've then got great slabs of schizophrenic instrumental playing covering a variety of styles - even Iommi's solo is a MASTERPIECE.HE MAKES HIS GUITAR SING.

B00B2PHSIY|1.0|Bought this to go on a scuba trip. Application is easy. Ahe difference it makes in the water is very good. Really drives home how important a filter is while shooting underwater video.  My biggest complaint was the quality of material.  It cracked the first time out. So my second dive I used the filter with a crack, it did show up on my video, bit not to bad.  The next dive out.....on the boat the whole think broke into pieces......what a waste of money.  Spend a little extra and get quality......it will give you good video to have a filter, just not this one.
