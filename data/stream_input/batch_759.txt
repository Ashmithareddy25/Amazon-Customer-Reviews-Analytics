1594489505|5.0|This is one of the best reads I have had in a long time.  When I bought this book, I didn't think this book would make such an impression on my thoughts regarding Afganstan, boy was I wrong.  Khalid, does a great job with making you feel you know the charactors as well as feel their pain.  This is a must read.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I'm sure you've heard this all before, \\"Beautifully shot with an unprecidented budged and filmed entirely in HD blah blah blah\\".  What you are truly getting is a sincere ode to the third rock from the sun.  My God we live on a gorgeous planet.  As an American, I frequently take my own country for granted and what beauties lie within our coasts.  I watched this expecting cool videos of Africa and South America, but I was surpirsed to see captivating views of redwood forests and mamouth caves.  In addition to this, take a tour of the ocean deep, the frosted top of the word, the peaks of the Andes and Himilayas and the deserts which turn into grasslands for three months a year.  I almost feel that if you don't watch this on Blu-ray on an HDTV, you are cheating yourself.  Finally, the info provided is not in any way \\"preachy\\" about a greener lifestyle.  The narrator allows us to do it all on our own.  So sit back, relax, and explore this beautiful planet we call home.
0226264017|3.0|While I believe Milton Friedman was an intelligent person with some views that are highly intellectually stimulating even when I disagree with them, this is definitely not his best work.  Capitalism and Freedom is unnecessarily brief and therefore, the arguments Friedman makes come off as overly simplistic and lacking any real depth.  If you're looking for a better read by Milton Friedman, read Free to Choose.  The arguments in Free to Choose are much more detailed and therefore, more convincing.
1569242739|5.0|Wow!! I bake at a coffee shop and have used several of the recipes from this book, and they were all a hit!! Love the pistachio rose water. You would never know that these are vegan! YUMMY!!!
B0010VD7EO|5.0|Pay no attention to the editorial review posted by amazon.  This is by far the best I've heard since the New Year.  Definitely going to be on Top 10 lists for 2008.
0452289963|5.0|This book makes me slow down and think about things more.  It helps to point out issues within yourself and others so that don't react negatively to things and situations.
B000TGJ8CQ|5.0|If you could see the future, would you be rich or a government slave?<br />Are we really more connected to some people than others?<br />Is there really a \\"greater good\\" that needs to be served<br />in the name of goodness?<br />The good thing about this movie is it gives you nothing about<br />\\"predestination\\" or loops in time.<br />The acting is very good, the script writing and setting are also fine.<br />They did maybe more than justice to Philip K. Dick's idea.If the Hollywood people would only learn to read sci fi for themselves,<br />Gordon R. Dickson's work<br />might also find justice in a script.
B0012QE4QC|4.0|It is the year 1518; after years of marriage, England's Queen Catherine has delivered a still-born daughter, much to the chagrin of King Henry VIII.  The ambitious Duke of Norfolk suggests that his niece, Anne Boleyn, become Henry's mistress and give him the male heir he desires.  The King doesn't take to Anne, but is attracted to Mary, her younger, married sister, and an affair begins.  Mary has a son, but Henry abandons her and pursues Anne who insists that Henry marry her.  To do that, Henry severs relations with Catholic Rome.  His short marriage to Anne is disappointing; when she produces a daughter, he tires of her.  She is accused of treason and adultery and executed.<br /><br />While the film's costumes, sets, and photography are truly sumptuous, something is lacking here.  As much as I enjoyed watching it, the film was immediately forgettable.  The story has been told many times before and there is nothing new here nor are the performances memorable enough to stand out from previous renditions.<br /><br />Scarlett Johansson (Mary), Natalie Portman (Anne), and Eric Bana (Henry) are all fine, but not remarkable.  The script plays fast and loose with historical facts and time and lacks a feeling of high drama, but it is a visual feast.  It's a pleasant-enough tale that could and should have been better.
B000VNMMPM|4.0|Luc Besson is definitely one of my favorite directors / writers of all time. I mean come on... we're talking the director of films such as The Fifth Element, Nikita (La Femme Nikita), and my personal favorite Leon (The Professional). He has an incredible eye behind the camera, knows how to tell an original story, and a style where you know you're watching something Luc has had his hands in whether it's producing, directing or writing.    Angel-A starts out with the down and out character, Andre (played quite well by Jamel Debbouze) finding himself in debt with a slew of different parties and no way out. In his despair he decides to climb on a bridge and jump off ending his worries and lonely life. However, as he is about to jump he looks over and sees a rather tall, beautiful blonde about to do the same. She jumps from the bridge and Andre jumps into the water to save her. Upon saving her life he finds out that her name is Angela (Angel-A). A series of events occur and we find it is Angela who is actually saving Andre's life. We also come to find that Angela is not your typical woman and \\"fell from the sky\\" to save him.    Filmed in black and white and with subtitles this film has some stunning cinematography often associated with Besson's work. The story itself is primarily about loving one's self and ultimately loving others. It's engaging, interesting and a beautiful tale. Highly recommended if you're a fan of Besson's work.
068484267X|5.0|This book already has a ton of reviews that give the gist of the storyline, so I won't repeat that here.  I do, however, feel compelled to share that this memoir is extremely well-written and I found myself teary-eyed several times.  When I was about 3/4 of the way through the book, I found myself busting out my checkbook to get donations out to charities that I've been putting off for awhile.  It has opened my eyes to the struggles that so many go through that I have no concept of here in my middle-class suburban world.  Angela's Ashes is not only a great read with emotional pull, it likely will change the way you look at the world and the place you have in it.  Happy reading!
1400079179|5.0|This is by far one my favorite stories of all time!  It was a superb murder mystery filled with lots of historical places, biblical themes, religious intrigue, and more!  It was the quintessential 'page turner' - and so much better than the movie.  If you like this one, you should check out 'Sinners and Social Workers' by Norah S. Bernard.
B000YABYLA|1.0|I really don't get how people liked this movie so much, or how it won awards.    This movie was painful to watch.  It was one of few movies that I was just waiting for it to be over.  When she had the baby I was relieved because that meant it would end soon.    I kept my mouth shut so my girlfriend could enjoy it, but she hated it too.    It was so wrong to advertise Michael Cera as a co-star.  He was in this film hardly at all.  Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner has much more screentime.  Cera was the reason I saw the movie, and his lacking just made it more disappointing.  If you like Arrested Development and Superbad, this is NOT the movie for you. (I love Arrested Development, Superbad was ok.)    The soundtrack was also horrible, just like the \\"art\\" (or whatever you call it) for the movie intro.  It was like Napolean Dynamite, except much worse and whiny.  This director needs a good slap on the head, to snap out of this stupid artsy garbage.  How can people buy that?  Did critics actually think it was artsy in a good way?  All it did was make me roll my eyes.    The story and morals of this movie are good.  I still found the overall story and message to be solid.  Ellen Page, the directing, the music, lack of Michael Cera, art, and dialogue - all terrible.  I can't tell if they tried too hard, or not enough.  This was torture to watch.  You can't pay me to see it again.
B0011HOEY4|3.0|The movie has some good bar room scenes with Denzel Washington and his gang members who outnumber Russell Crowe's group of cops. Russell Crowe has some good scenes in which he confronts the U.S. army. But the ending is a let down after all the buildup which promised a good conclusion.
1577312082|5.0|It is certainly recognized as a spiritual classic. It is simple to understand and has really touched the lifes of many. It is nice to have it in cd.
B000EWBKKI|4.0|The Terminator is one of the great action movies of our time. That's not what this review is about.<br /><br />This review is about the video quality of this Blu-ray disc. The menus are fantastic 1080p resolution, but the actual movie looks as though it was pulled from the same source used for the DVD, which is much better than VHS, but not as good as more recent, pure HD video.<br /><br />The movie is a fantastic one, but I'd say to save your money and get the standard definition DVD since the picture quality is about the same.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|I think this is a wonderful album.  I only own two Enya CDs at the moment, but I am slowly falling in love with her and her art.  It's nice to know that there are still people out there who are writing decent music that you can slip into like a comfy robe and that doesn't knock you over the head.  Easily my favorite track on the disc is \\"Amid the Falling Snow\\" -- there's a sweet, joyous delicacy to it that I just can't put my finger on.  Pretty much all of the songs, however, are quite memorable.  Some of them are lovely and sad; sometimes they sparkle with a hint of positivity and unattainable happiness, while others have a more haunting depth to them.  Another standout on this album is \\"It's in the Rain\\" -- when I first saw the video of this song on YouTube, I knew I had to buy the entire thing.    I have to admit, I have a harder time getting into Enya's more energetic, \\"tribal\\" songs.  An example of this kind of effort on this particular album is \\"The River Sings.\\"  These sound very unusual to me -- still, if you allow it some time to sink in and contrast it with the other tracks, it does become possible to appreciate it as well for what it is.  \\"Sumiregusa\\" is also another excellent highlight on this disc -- as you listen to it, you can tell she's trying to reach out to *something*, yet sadly it just seems to be slightly out of her grasp (that's my interpretation, anyways).  \\"Drifting\\" is probably the most plain and restrained composition on the list, but heartbreaking love songs such as \\"Amarantine,\\" \\"If I Could Be Where You Are,\\" and \\"A Moment Lost\\" definitely make up for that.  In addition, \\"Long Long Journey\\" sounds utterly triumphant.    I really only needed to give this CD a spin two or three times before I truly became swept away by its mysterious and poetic beauty.  I discovered melodies and lyrics throughout that are, put simply, not of this earth.  In short, I think anyone who is fond of the \\"New Age\\" genre will find it difficult not to enjoy this marvelous release from Enya (her style is certainly hard to pigeon hole, but I think in many ways it's fair to use that label to describe what she does).

B000001E7T|5.0|I bought this somewhat on a whim, having only seen the video for \\"Down By The Water,\\" along with PJ's other album Rid Of Me. Honestly, I expected to like the other better, but I have absolutely fallen in love with this record. It's so dark and haunting and beautiful--and not really what I was expecting based on just one song. But I suppose that's fitting of all of PJ's work.<br /><br />If you're at all interested in PJ Harvey, or alternative music or female musicians, you must own this album!
B000ZN803G|1.0|I went into the film with very little expectation.  I didn't make it through the first half hour.  I just didn't feel anything for the main character or his family.  A college graduate gives away his unearned college fund and abandons the life his parents gave him.  Whoop de doo.  He became homeless by choice.  I live in San Francisco and I see it everyday, homeless by choice.  For me it is not a revelation.  i just couldn't see myself watching this guy try to find himself for two hours.
B000NA28I4|1.0|I have loved the book. However the movie was a disappointment. It ruined the image completely. I think someone else could have done better.    However when not compared to the book the movie was alright.
B000031XCR|4.0|This CD has been out for several years now. This is a collection of what will prove to be her best songs ever.   Celine has always had a great voice. At this time she was singing wonderful songs that were well written. She had the best writers in the business and her songs showed it.  The Power of Love, Beauty and the Beast, Because you Loved Me, My Heart will go on, amongst others are included here.  To me the best song on this CD is her duet with the late Frank Sinatra  With today's technology she mixed her voice with \\"Ole Blue Eyes\\" and really out did herself.  This CD is loaded with classics.............
B0011Z7JRU|5.0|I love amazon mp3's. This Zep. CD is a must have. Great rock band and great drummer.
0439206472|4.0|When I first got this book, the Baudilaires looked like a family to me. Young adult mum, with a husband and a new baby. In fact, the three of them are orphan children. There is Violet, who is fourteen and a talented inventor. Then there is twelve-year old Klaus, more of a researcher and source of info. Last there is Sunny, who is still a baby and likes to bite things. BITE was her first word!  When they are on the beach one day, they are informed of a fire that killed their parents. A distant relative named Count Olaf gets custody of them and the adversity really begins for them...  It's a decent book but it isn't really one I'd recommend to people. The later books are better.
B000Z66RSS|5.0|I noticed that the Breaking Benjamin song is missing, and I really REALLY wish that the song/mix that they use at the end of the movie was on the soundtrack. Why is it they always leave off the awesome stuff?
0452289963|5.0|A New Earth is an eye-opening journey into the concious and how paying more attention to your unconcious thoughts and behaviors can manifest a deeper enjoyment of the present moment.  Tolle does an excellent job of explaining this very complex topic in a very thoughtful and non-judgemental manner.  Those looking for offense, in terms of Tolle's questioning of commonly held religious views, will certainly find it if they are looking hard enough.  However, those looking to expand their knowledge about how their mind functions and its possible connection to spirituality will find that Tolle's explanations are helpful.  I have been a Christian my entire life, but have been plagued by the inability to keep my thoughts in check which ultimately affected my ability to \\"walk in love\\" and \\"trust in the Lord.\\" Often I felt a prisoner in the noisy cage of my own thoughts, wondering why I couldn't seem to find any peace. The Bible, in this regard, had little to say about how your mind can sometimes be your worst enemy and what it did have to say did not seem to help me heal this.  A New Earth, and other books such as A Return to Love by Marianne Williamson, and Tolle's first best-seller The Power of Now gave me the tools that I needed to tame my mind and put my brain in the service of my heart.  It has not replaced my faith in God, Jesus, and the Bible.  In fact, it has made it even more important to me.  If you are a Christian plagued with anxiety, compulsive thinking, depression, or regret and you are willing to put aside a \\"spirit of offense\\" towards ideas that are unfamiliar you will find this book powerful and life-changing.

0975991477|5.0|Bruce Lipton has given each of us something to think about with this book.  The pathway between thought and thing, or between our thoughts and the physiological changes in our bodies, ties together ancient wisdom, \\"As a man thinketh, so it is done to him...\\" and modern medicine -- The Stress Response, The Placebo Response, Psycho-Somatic Illness, The Mind-Body Connection, and other concepts that, if understood, can give the reader a surprising degree of control over their own health and life experience.  This book isn't a book you should read because you heard it was \\"a good book;\\" you should read this book because each of us needs to think about the possibilities that arise when you approach life with this understanding.  If this book were required reading for middle-school students, America's health (and happiness) would improve dramatically.  This book will change the way you approach your life -- and the way you think about life.  Thanks for writing this, Bruce!
B000OBYLVO|5.0|I am admittedly a sucker for romantic comedies, but for some reason the preview for this film left me uninterested when it first came out, so I never got around to seeing it.<br /><br />After hearing enough of my fellow romantic comedy fans recommend it, I finally sat down to watch it and was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />For some reason I initially thought the casting seemed off, but I was very wrong - all four of the main characters were excellent, and the supporting actors were equally delightful. I was very skeptical about Jack Black as a romantic lead, but I was surprised to find I had a bit of a crush on his character by the end! Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet were there usual excellent selves, and Jude Law was pretty much just as gorgeous and charming as anyone could be.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Love Actually, What Women Want and all the \\"classic\\" romantic comedies, I'd guess that you'd be a fan of this one. It left me with a huge smile and excited to see it again.<br /><br />On a last note, my husband actually enjoyed this one as well, and let's just say that romantic comedy aren't generally his favorite genre.\\" Overall this is a perfect film for a girls night, a date night, or just a feel good \\"pick me up\\" for a rainy evening.
1582701709|5.0|The Secret has certainly created a stir; and that's one of the main reasons I give this book 5-stars.  This isn't my favorite book; but it has engaged many people in the search for something spiritual.  Though many people who have read this book are disappointed, my guess is that they were already disappointed and that many things in life disappoint them -- this book simply isn't the cure-all, or magic trick, they were hoping for.  The Secret is a book that will make you think about things you never thought of before (unless this isn't new to you); and this book was brilliantly packaged and marketed in such a way as to introduce many people to the power of their own thoughts.  There may be better voices; but this is a great song.  This is the first book in a long time to come right out and say many of these things without worrying about how politically-correct it was said -- extra credit for boldly delivering a potentially controversial message.  There is no doubt in my mind that the concepts in this book are useful; nonetheless, it is up to the reader to continue their own exploration.    The problems with this book seem to be that a very complex set of concepts was explored authoritatively by someone who is not really an expert.  These concepts make up a lifetime of study for some people; and cannot be fully taught in such a small volume.  The DVD was much more thorough, but was still only a brief introduction to only a handful of the people working in this field -- many of whom are really Entrepreneurs, and not spiritual gurus (though many have put on that mask since The Secret...).    The ideas that people bring bad experiences upon themselves with their thinking is too complex for such simple treatment -- and the people who are up in arms about this are not thinking properly either.  The fact is that all is well and balanced; judgments are simply judgments.  The world is much bigger than any of us can truly comprehend in a meaningful and useful way.  If we arethinking about the problems of others on the other side of the world, we simply aren't using our resources effectively.  We can't help those people until we learn how to think better (...not worrying about what we can't change, for instance).  We can become the change we seek in the world; but not by worrying and complaining.    The Secret introduces many concepts -- maybe oversimplified -- that we all need to be thinking about.  The critics who complain about \\"WHAT\\" people are, or might be, \\"asking for,\\" or using The Secret to get, have missed the point, too.  These are still just judgments; and the fact remains that, if The Secret were rubbish, the critics are wasting their time complaining about rubbish -- are these guides you want to follow?    The Secret shouldn't be viewed as one of the more important Spiritual works of our time; but it is undoubtedly a powerful work of consciousness to get the attention of so many people in such a short period of time -- and it should be remembered for the sheer number of people it introduced to the concept of taking more active control of your thought-life.  If you didn't like The Secret, look for more practical spiritual works, such as Jeff Maziarek's \\"Spirituality Simplified,\\" or \\"Ask and It is Given,\\" by Esther and Jerry Hicks.  There are many to choose from these days -- and The Secret is also responsible for inspiring more complete spiritual guides to fill an information gap left by this book.  But that isn't a bad thing -- hunger for knowledge is what makes you hunt and consume knowledge.    I think the variety of responses to The Secret is a bit reminiscent of Goldilocks and the Three Bears:  There are newcomers to the idea of a mental/spiritual Universe, who tried it and didn't like it because they didn't understand it enough to make it work; and there are \\"spiritual adepts\\" who picked the book up and found themselves casting judgments because of what the book wasn't saying, or the \\"bad\\" places it might lead readers;and then there are some for whom the book is just right -- those who know enough, but not too much, and those who simply accept it for what it is without judging it for what it is not.  The Secret is as good a starting point for the spiritual path as any; but keep walking and keep looking.  Your journey has only just begun...  There's much more to this story than any one book can give you.
0753820250|5.0|What a wonderful read and trip into mystery, suspense, love, hate, and desire in all of their truest forms.<br />I will be recommending this book to my book club and hope that they take my lead and delve into Julian Carax and Daniel Sempere.
1582701709|1.0|Buy this book if you believe:    People who get raped, abused, assaulted, molested, or murdered deserve it because they 'attracted' it with their thoughts.    You can get that fancy dress, car, or house by just 'wishing for it hard enough' - Tell this to the homeless, day dreamers, or assembly line workers of america.    You can be thin, just about thinking about being thin, and turning your back on fat people in your life and surroundings. - Tell this to the millions of overweight people who think about being thin constantly, and the thin people who NEVER think about being thin.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|Don't chuck this away after 1 or 2 listens. This is the type of complex sound that creeps up on you and opens up into one of the best albums of the year. From start to finish it is unique in that in has a cohesive sound (which in very rare in music). Standing tall above the fore fathers of experiments in sound Radiohead surpasses such iconic masters as early OMD, Kraftwork, and many of the Artists in the 4AD Label.  In Rainbows is a massive treat for the ears and the mind. I love this album from beginning to end, but if I had to pick a favorite it would be \\"House of Cards\\".    In Rainbows has some sounds that are a toss back to The Bends and other works from the Radiohead music library. Almost like a mixture of the best Radiohead sounds over the years have been put together to create In Rainbows.   This is something you do not want to miss out on - but if you are looking for a pop sensation or american idol - you are not going to find it here. This is art for the ears. If it could it would be hung in the Metropolitan Museum of Modern Art!
0393320928|4.0|\\"The scientist has a lot of experience with ignorance and doubt and uncertainty, and this experience is of very great importance, I think. When a scientist doesn't know the answer to a problem, he is ignorant. When he has a hunch as to what the result is, he is uncertain. And when he is pretty darn sure of what the result is going to be, he is still in some doubt. We have found it of paramount importance that in order to progress we must recognize our ignorance and leave room for doubt. Scientific knowledge is a body of statements of varying degrees of certainty--some most unsure, some nearly sure, but none absolutely certain.<br />Now, we scientists are used to this, and we take it for granted that it is perfectly consistent to be unsure, that it is possible to live and not know. But I don't know whether everyone realizes this is true.\\" Feynman, The Value of Science<br /><br />The book's title relates to Feynman's telling of his relationship and experiences with his first wife, Arlene, a victim of Hodgkin's disease. But the subtitle of this book would have made a better title than the one used. Feynman was indeed a curious sort, and he begins by telling how his father encouraged his curiosity.<br /><br />Feynman achieved a measure of celebrity that few scientists do, and as a result, he sometimes found a forum for his thoughts outside of strict science. He was a fun and likeable man, and an innovative thinker as regards certain scientific difficulties; he wasn't much of a philosopher (evidenced by the fact that he thought Voltaire was a good philosopher), and in fact didn't like philosophy. While he was intelligent enough to admit that his views on art, culture, history, religion, and politics should not be taken too seriously, he was generally happy, and perhaps anxious, to offer such of his views anyway, and they are usually entertaining: \\"I believe that a scientist looking at nonscientific problems is just as dumb as the next guy--and when he talks about a nonscientific matter, he sounds as naive as anyone untrained in the matter. Since the question of the value of science is not a scientific subject, this talk is dedicated to proving my point-- by example.\\" RF, The Value of Science<br /><br />It hardly seems correct to call the short articles he wrote `essays', so I'll call them writings. This volume is a collection of Feynman's personal writings, with some contributions from physicist friends Freeman Dyson and Henry Bethe. Most of the book is Feynman's account of his work as a Commissioner investigating the space shuttle Challenger disaster.<br /><br />This isn't a great science text, it isn't great literature; it's more like listening in on Feynman's thoughts and conversations. Apart from minimal aspects of Appendix F (Feynman's appendix to the Presidential Commission Report) his book isn't particularly technical. It's rather `light' and entertaining, and anyone interested in Feynman, in NASA and the US manned space program, or in bureaucratic `ethics' (or perversion thereof), will almost certainly enjoy it.sounds as naive as anyone untrained in the matter.

B000007MVD|5.0|This is a collection of Beatles songs on BBC radio between 1962-1965. It includes self composed songs and classic numbers performed by the Beatles. These are LIVE radio tracks, only one or two songs are live in concert. There are funny speeches and jokes as well. This CD was out of print for sometime but has been back in print since I bought it in June 2001. This is a must for any Beatles fan.
B000000OSE|5.0|Guns N Roses have many excellent albums but when it comes down to variety Use Your Illusion is full of variety. Both parts 1 and 2 are full of variety. But I am reviewing part one here and it is a masterpiece just like the second part. Not that their other albums aren't masterpieces.  Ok, this cd is as perfect as Guns N Roses gets if there is such a thing as perfection. Every track has a mood of its own and that is what makes the Use Your Illusion discs so special. There are songs that make you laugh, cry, party, depressed, happy, angry, anarchist, quirky. It's all here. Get them both. Every rock, metal listener and quite franky any music lover should have this in their collection.
B000002W9Q|5.0|This has a mix of 50s, 60s, 70s, and early 80s music. My personal favorites are \\"In the Still of the Night\\" and \\"The Time of my Life.\\" My friend Michelle sang \\"The Time of my Life\\" and I always think of her when I hear that song. This is a classic album for people of all generations.
B000M4RG42|4.0|If the movie hadn't have flopped, would Adam Beach now have an Oscar on his mantelpiece or sitting on his toilet tank or wherever he wanted to keep it?  I vote yes, his performance as Ira Hayes is indelibly seared into my brain pan now, and he doesn't even have that much screen time.  In fact Adam Beach's performance is bigger than the movie and maybe that's a bad thing, but look at La Vie En Rose, in which Marion Cotillard is giving a fantastic performance in a bad movie and she still managed to snag that Oscar.<br /><br />Anyhow Beach is sublime and almost makes me interested enough in the \\"real Ira Hayes\\" to read a biography of him.  His life seems tragic, the way everyone calls him \\"Chief\\" and then makes a mockery of his human rights with the next breath.  The sergeant summons him, \\"Get your red assright over here, Hayes!\\" an expression I've never heard before but maybe native Americans get this sort of abuse every day.  After the war is over he has one job, to sell war bonds by appearing at mass rallies, and eventually his love if alcohol burns him out completely, that and the memory of seeing too many ghastly things on that faraway Pacific island.  Eastwood photographs him as though he were Christ at Calvary, stumbling around towards other, divine place beyond this earth.<br /><br />We laughed though to see Tom McCarthy as the narrator, the journalist putting together the big inside story of Iwo Jima, when now we see the same actor on THE WIRE as Scott Templeton, the lazy journalist without scruples who just makes up his sources willy-nilly; if he can't find a great quote he just makes it up and ascribes it to an imaginary figure.  Sort of gives FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS a new light!
0743486285|3.0|The Heroin Diaries, written by Ian Gittins and Nikki Sixx, is a thoughtfully assembled project and quite a good read but I'm just not sure how much Nikki Sixx really had to do with it.    I am by no means suggesting that Nikki Sixx is not intelligent enough to write a book.  His brilliance is clearly evident in his success in making Mötley Crüe one of the biggest bands of the 1980s (who can also still fill stadiums 20+ years later.)  My suspicion stems from the impression that the book reads more like a story based on a year in the life of Nikki Sixx than an actual account.      Although it is written in diary form complete with dates, times and locations, it reads too smoothly and coherently to be a real diary.  Journals are not that thorough especially ones written by a strung-out, hard-core heroin addict.  The voice throughout the book also has a little too much \\"English\\" on it to be primarily that of Nikki Sixx.  Imagine Joe Elliot from Def Leppard telling you about a year in the life of Nikki Sixx; that's the tone.  I suspect Ian Gittin's did the lion's share of the writing after interviewing Sixx, as well as other players who are quoted throughout and maybe combing through some random notes from that time period.  Then Nikki Sixx read and rubber-stamped it perhaps adding a few more remarks.    Regardless of Sixx's level of involvement, it is a good book.  The diary approach with added comments from people who close to Sixx at that time, is a creative and refreshing approach especially considering how glutted the music biography market is right now.  Although Vanity (aka Evangelist Denise Matthews) was somewhat abused in the process.  Gittins and Sixx used her remarks as a bit of comic relief.  Nothing she said had anything to do directly with the entry before it or Nikki Six for that matter.  Her comments were little fire and brimstone sermons warning against a hedonistic lifestyle.  It's not exaggerating to say Gittins and Sixx portrayed her like a fool.It is also not surprising.  We learn in the Heroin Diaries that nice is not really Sixx's style.  He really lets it all hang out and is honest about his abusive behavior toward his bandmates, managers, women (he describes knocking Vanity out cold and dragging her out of his house by her hair) and basically anyone within earshot at times.  He also, of course, abuses himself with addictive substances including but not limited to pot, alcohol, cocaine and, of course, heroin.  There are very descriptive passages detailing the paranoia and depression that he suffered including chronic hallucinations.  The Added Comments section following each entry allowed the people Sixx hurt to vent what their feelings were toward him at the time.  It is interesting to see where they agree and where they react differently.  The level of awareness fluctuates fairly dramatically from person to person.    Occasionally, Sixx comments on his own entries.  Oddly enough he rarely shows much emotion in these instances.  He'll usually give some more background but does not show remorse.  Although, you do at times pick up a hint of pride or at least amusement.    I wasn't convinced that the more outlandish stories actually happened.  Tom Zutaut did corroborate that Sixx had sex with Zutaut's date right in front of him and others backstage one night.  (The authors also felt compelled to mention that girl was menstruating at the time.) However, it is about as believable as Alice Cooper's claim to have masturbated and then deposited the results in his sister's doughnut.  (A story Cooper has since retracted.)  Every hard rock memoir seems to require a handful of over-the-top, gross-out moments in the hopes of becoming lore.  It is also worth mentioning that Tom Zutaut seems to be the go-to guy to corroborate more than a few of these gross-outs.    Since it is only a year-long account from twenty years ago, it's not particularly clear whether Sixx has changed his evil ways.  He does include a bulletpoint listing of his life from the late eighties through 2006 in which he briefly recounts his numerous attempts to beat drugs, relapse then beat them again; get married, have kids, get divorced, get married to Donna Derico, have kids, cheat and get divorced again.  Suffice to say, he appears to be no angel but you get the sense that he is trying to find a balance.    One such effort at redemption is that Sixx is donating profits from the Heroin Diaries to Running Wild, a charity he set up with Covenant House to help runaway children.  He also states in the introduction that his intention behind the book is to discourage people from taking drugs.  I'm not qualified to determine if this book can make that kind of impact but I do believe he is sincere.  These last two considerations alone make Heroin diaries worth picking up but if you just want crap on the Crüe, you'll find that too.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|After having purchased this set, I must say that I am awestruck with the beauty and depth of content here!    The documentary contains both animals and views of nature that most people will never experience in real life. I found the quality and narration both to be top-notch.    If you have HD capability, this is the first set of discs you should buy!
B00024BHTC|5.0|God, I'm on my second spin on this CD (it's that GREAT!) & it makes me wonder why I didn't give Nightwish more of a chance years ago when I first checked them out. I guess at that time I wasn't able to fully appreciate metal of this caliber, but years later I can honestly say that I UNDERSTAND what this music is about now & I'm glad that I can blast it & really get into it! Over the last few years I've getting myself back into not only this wonderful kind of music which Nightwish produces (operatic/progressive metal) but also power & progressive metal. I think some music just takes time to really hit you, & when it does you really like what you hear & you just can't believe it took you so long to finally grasp it. Check this CD out if you've dabbled with operatic type metal before & didn't give it enough of a chance...you might be REALLY surprised! This CD is heavy & beautiful music wrapped into 1 tightly wound package which deserves to be opened!
B000YPUF9W|2.0|The Resident Evil series is one of the most famous video game sagas in existance, right up there with Dragon Warrior, Final Fantasy, Madden, Mario, etc. The stories are full of twists and dark secrets, and the games are nothing but fun, especially lately with Resident Evil 4 winning game of they year many times over and Resident Evil 5 looking amazing.    That being said, the movies are disappointing. I wouldn't call them bad, and they definately aren't good, but disappointing they are. I personally liked the first movie. It had style and environment, and that made up for the fact that it had absolutely nothing to do with they game. However, as the trilogy went on, the lack of the real story really hurt the series and ultimately doomed it.     While better than the mess that was the second movie, Resident Evil Road Warrior (i.e. Extinction) still comes up short of both the environment and style of the first movie as well as the whole premise of the video games which made Resident Evil cool in the first place.
0805079831|2.0|Naomi certainly makes some interesting points and has done heavy duty research. What she is saying strikes a chord with many people, which explains why this book receives so many positive reviews.<br /><br />Unfortunately, though, the vitriolic nature of this work makes Naomi seem like a loose cannon or a hammer looking for a nail. She doesn't pretend to hide her contempt for privitization, Milton Friedman, free market capitalism, Chicago school economics, and what not. There is no pretense of balance as she employees jackhammer-style reasoning (often with little proof). She doesn't account for the subtleties of the issues involved. In her her jackhammer approach, a spade is a spade and if it isn't--it becomes one. She flattens distinctions and broadsides nuances into flat surfaces. And, as it has already been pointed out elsewhere, Naomi uses every rhetorical trick in the book.<br /><br />Her attacks on Milton Friedman are particularly vitriolic. And yet the system she critiques as being \\"Friedmanite\\" doesn't even come close to implementing his ideals fully!  Klein attacks Friedman for supporting tyranny in Chile, but really, all Friedman did was advise the Chilean government, and those reforms were implemented to  some degree. Hardly cause to attack Friedman's character. And, of course, Naomi lists bad things that happened under free-market systems, but doesn't contrast that with what happened under those same countries under a government regulated economy. According to Naomi, the Cato Institute is neo-conservative and FDR's New Deal was not only good, but necessary. OK. I'll have to differ on that, but let's continue..<br /><br />Be prepared for nauzeating buzz-words with no value except for emotional and rhetorical: \\"Corporate new jerusalem\\", \\"balooning corporate power\\", \\"radical free market\\", \\"corporatist\\", \\"dazzling rich and disposable poor\\", \\"corporate supremisist\\", \\"the rise of corpratism\\", \\"ultra-conservative\\", \\"maniacal quest\\", \\"the corporatist alliance\\", etc.<br /><br />Naomi does have a valid critique regarding the way the government panders to big firms and, in privitization, plays political games. But that is not really a critique of true free-market capitalism, but rather it a critique of a particular form of government intervention over against another form of it.<br /><br />There's no doubt that Naomi is quite sharp and intelligent and that this book is no small feat. But, really, I suggest you look elsewhere if you want a balanced critique from a similar perspective. There isn't much in this book to commend it to you. The unique true facts in this book can be found elsewhere, and without the poisonous vitriol.<br /><br />And in closing, if you've already read Naomi's attack on Milton Friedman, do yourself a favor and read his ideas first hand--in \\"Capitalism and Freedom\\". He deserves a fair evaluation--without Naomi's sarcastic, slanted rhetoric.a valid critique regarding the way the government panders to big firms and, in privitization, plays political games.

B000001FDK|5.0|I love musicals, so this might make me biased, but I like this soundtrack. Although I would have to say that after the first four or five songs, they seem to repeat. That said, I had listened to the soundtrack before seeing the movie, and once I saw it the rest of the songs made more sense, but they all did have a bit of the same elements in them. I prefer Broadway music, not pop culture musicals. But still I good album.

0671015206|4.0|This is the second time I am reading this book and it has enlightened me once again on what it takes to be a wealthy.  I think some people who read the book give it an overly simplistic view, while there is a deeper insight that is often missed about millionaires.<br /><br />In the beginning of the book in the introduction, the authors discuss what the definition of wealthy is.  Millionaires seem to accumulate wealthy by investing their money rather then spending money.  The Authors break down what the media has us perceive millionaires are by showing their big houses, their luxury cars and expensive suites.  This is a good starting ground because you can see who the wealthy are.  They draw on the fact that true millionaires are Prodigious Accumulator of Wealth (PAW), who does things to build wealth.  They draw on Under Accumulator of Wealth (UAW, are great consumers, buying for status rather then for wealth.<br /><br />In the first chapter the authors also talk about the top ethnic groups who are wealthy and their likelihood of becoming wealthy. This is a good motivator because it suggests that most American can or should be wealthy.  One misinformed reviewer thought that Black was an ethnic group, when it is actually a race.  The authors did a splendid job in not making wealth a race issue, but wanted to separate which ethnic group is more likely to be wealthy.  While any one can become a millionaire, how long you reside in the United States is a big factor in that.<br /><br />Chapter two is about being frugal and how the wealthy preserve their capital while others are consumers.  They do not go over what types of wealth the PAW gathers, but they tell what they do not focus on.  They also break down the mental picture of who the wealthy are.  Do the wear Armani suites, drive Porches, and live in million dollars homes, no.  The answer may be surprising because the media has given us a different picture of what wealthy should be.  It is encouraging to note that most millionaires live in small towns, drive inexpensive cars, and wear moderate clothing.  The authors break down the idea that wealthy people may not look like they have money because their focus is accumulating wealth, not in acquiring possessions.  They recommend that this is counter productive.<br /><br />Chapter 3 gives you an insight on time, energy and money.  It goes over what the wealthy worry about and don't.  It also shows what the wealthy know about shopping, their finances and their life.  They most spend their time knowing the small stuff about their finances and how to save money.  This chapter is a reflection of chapter two.  It also goes over the consumption habits of the PAW and the UAW to show you how different they are.<br />Chapter 4 you aren't what you drive speaks about the kinds of cars the wealthy drive.  This chapter should have been shortened because they seem to repeat the central themes of the chapter over and over to drive their point home.  It was interesting to note that many of the PAW's drive used vehicles over 5 years old and rarely by new cars.<br /><br />Chapter 5 Economic Outpatient and Chapter 6 Affirmative Action, Family Style both lost me. Economic outpatient is when a wealthy parent provides a yearly gift or money to a PAW child which the authors suggest is why they are PAW in the first place.  Chapter six describes who typically gets the Economic Outpatient and gives the peril of these discussions.  This lost me because I could not figure out who they authors were talking to.  Were they talking to the reader as a parent, the reader as a child or the reader as both?  When thinking about, their vagueness on this issue I think it was written for both; one not to except it and one not to offer it.  I believe both of these chapters should have been combined and shortened to make it less confusing.<br /><br />Chapter 7 Finding your Niche and Chapter 8 Jobs: Millionaire Versus Heirs could have also been combines because both discusesthe types of jobs and service that one can perform to become wealthy.  While it may be common knowledge that the wealthy own business but what types of jobs do they have if they are not entrepreneurs?  Generally these types of jobs gives them a stream of income like lawyers, doctors, real estate professional, auctioneers and accountants.<br /><br />If you are looking for a book that teaches you a step by step approach on how to be a millionaire, this is not the book for you.  If you want a book that explains who these individuals are and how to be like them, then you want to read it.  What the authors did was give a well researched book on who the wealthy people and how to be like them.<br /><br />I gave this 4 stars because Amazon does not allow for me to give it 3 ½ stars because there is a wealth of information in the book.<br /><br />Enjoyrm to become wealthy.

0393316041|5.0|Think of every stereotype you can of the scientist:  stodgy academic wearing a herringbone blazer with suede patch elbows, mad scientist with a penchant for the over-the-top experiment, intelligent misfit with pants cinched too high and a pocket protector.  Feynman is none of these. He is so very much more.  A misfit more apt to find humanity in a stripper than a theologian.  A man who never outgrew the natural curiosity of childhood, coupled with an entirely un-childlike willingness to follow through.  I can only imagine what working with him at Los Alamos might have been like.  The glimpses into his personal life here are few, but telling.  In these pages, we understand why Feynman is considered one of life's remarkable personalities.  He's the nerd we aspire to be...or at least wouldn't mind having dinner with.  But perhaps more important, what is revealed is the heart and the mind of a man whose life is testament to the richness of the human experience...and how easily we can get in its way.  I am forever glad that I met this man in these pages.  It was worth every moment.

0375751467|5.0|Required reading for any serious biologist. This is the theory from the man himself. Also valuable for understanding evolution in a historical sense. Darwin got some things wrong, but, in my reading of this (which I have done many times over), I am struck by the brilliance of a man who figured all this out in the absence of understanding the genetic mechanism of inheritance. I think Darwin is one of the great minds of western civilization, on a par with Newton, and he deserves FAR more respect than he is given today.<br /><br />For all the stir this book caused, for all the stir Darwin's legacy continues to stir today, I am always struck by his modesty and dedication to the principles of scientific endeavor.  He seems such a quiet man to have  revolutionized everything we know and understand about life.
B00006I53S|4.0|This camera is certainly cheaper than the L series, but you certainly don't get more than what you pay for. The IS is great, and certainly allows for better shots in the dark, but the sharpness sometimes leaves something to be desired. Don't get me wrong: you CAN get awesome pictures with this camera, but it is definitely not the norm with this lens.  The AF is indeed quiet and fast. It is also a heavy lens, and despite the construct being relatively solid, the lens will make your camera tip forward unless you have the extended battery pack.  All in all, worth the price. I have taken some great pictures! But don't be surprised if most of your shots end up in your recycle bin.

I like my history done with lots of panache,passion,seduction,betrayal and SHOWTIME had me glued to the tube with this \\"cliffhanging\\" 10 episode melodrama.    First off, it is BEAUTIFULLY produced,and there is a tremendous amount of \\"zing\\" in the production value alone.It is eye-catching,splashy with color,moves along nicely,plots are followed through,characters are REALLY developed,and the casting is brilliant.The music of court musician Thomas Tallis is wisely and expertly run throughout the entire series....very nicely done for someone who pays close attention to musical detail in production!    I must say, at first, Jonathan Rhys Meyers would not have been my first choice for a Henry V111, but after 10 minutes I got over that and was completely won over.The actors in THE TUDORS are passionate and I have got to say that Maria Doyle Kennedy who portrays Catherine of Aragon,Sam Neill as Cardinal Wolsey and Jeremy Northam as Thomas More are so in command of their characters that it is an absolute pleasure to watch them at their craft!!! This is a must see.Some of the best entertainment I have had in a long time!Come have a bodice-ripping good time!Looking forward to Season Two!

'REMEMBER ME?' is just another in a long line of thoroughly entertaining, extremely funny and wildly successful books by Sophie Kinsella.  In this, her third stand alone novel, we meet Lexi Smart a beautiful and successful career woman with a beautiful home and amazingly handsome husband.  Unfortunately for Lexi she has no idea how she got any of it.  Last she remembers it is 2004 and she has a dead end job, frizzy hair, crooked teeth and has just been stood up by a guy named Looser Dave.  Now she wakes up in a hospital bed only to find that she has amnesia and doesn't remember the last three years of her life including how everything fell into place.  But as time goes on and Lexi tries to settle back into her life she begins to realize that all that glitters isn't gold.<br /><br />I loved 'REMEMBER ME?' it was fast paced and as I said before...hilarious (as usual)!  If you've loved Sophie Kinsella's other books this one will not disappoint and if you have not read anything by this amazing author 'REMEMBER ME?' is as good a place to start as any!

B0002WZTOI|1.0|[[ASIN:B0002WZTPC Top Gun (Full Screen Collector's Edition)]][[ASIN:B0002WZTOI Top Gun (Widescreen Special Collector's Edition)]]  1986 was a huge year for many young adult males.  At YMCA centers nation wide, the sauna talk revolved around the anticipation of what was rumored to be Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer's most risky films yet.  The title alone, \\"Top Gun,\\" sent many young men into a frenzy.  The torch had been lit and millions wondered who had the \\"Top Gun.\\"  Most believed that Val would prove to be the manlier of men but Director Tony Scott kept his audience waiting and waiting in what could go down as the greatest theatrical tease of all time.     Meet Maverick AKA Pete Mitchell.  His school boy looks contradict his bad boy and hot shot attitude.  The way he handles his crotch rocket reveals to all that this young stud knows how to take someone for a ride.  Then there is Tom Kazanski who goes by the call sign of Ice (Man).  Make no doubt about it, the boy is ice cold.  The setting is very promising as the two young men find themselves at a military training base full of well muscled men and hot showers.  Amongst the temptations confronting a young and naive Maverick in both the locker room and showers enters a civilian analyst, Kelly McGillis (call sign Charlie).  McGillis only adds to Maverick's confusion by tricking him into thinking he is straight.  I am not sure where Scott was going with this one but clearly, he missed the landing.      The most upsetting thing about this film, is all of the lost potential.  There was the volley ball game which should have been played in the nude, and also deep conversations between Maverick and Goose (Anthony Edwards) that never went beyond talking.  Even Viper (Tom Skerritt) was denied his chance to prove his Top Gun potential while consoling Maverick who had just lost his life partner in a training exercise.  Scott couldn't do better than a curious hand sliding across a sweaty Pete Mitchell.  The real tragedy in \\"Top Gun\\" is that with new military guidelines which allow women into the armed services, Hollywood may have missed its chance at portraying a love story amongst male pilots.  Even worse, we never do find out who has the \\"Top Gun.\\"
B0012Q94QW|4.0|First of all, the movie is great.  The epic nature, the chases, the battles, everything is done to the max.  The viewer can really get the feel of living eons ago, with the struggles of daily life.  I truly enjoyed the entire movie.<br /><br />However, it may as well have been called Apocalypto II.<br /><br />A village of people lives peacefully enough.  They hunt giant mastadons and their entire way of life is dependent upon the yearly migration of the beasts.  Basically it's the B.C. version of the tatanka from \\"Dances With Wolves\\".  Each year the hunt gets more and more difficult, and the hunger of the village follows downward.  They must use their specially honed hunting tactics to take down their prey (Apocalypto!).  Unfortunately, the wise, witchdoctor woman - who apparently is capable of some serious magic - prophecizes that with the last hunt comes the end of their way.<br /><br />Actually, this movie is so full of mysticism, voodoo, mumbo-jumbo, signs, and legends that it's a little bit much to digest.  It seems that everyone in the movie has some kind of tale to tell.<br /><br />Anyway, the hunters from this village, who all vie for the sign of dominance in the village (the white spear), are not able to stop a group of hunter-collectors from a far away land from capturing many of their people during a raid (Apocalypto!).  It's up to a select few to chase after the enemies, and free their loved ones (Apocalypto!).<br /><br />Along the way the protagonist encounters a great sabertooth tiger who is trapped under a log, in a giant pit, and about to drown (Apocalypto!)  The hero saves the beast and becomes some kind of prehistoric Dr. Doolittle.<br /><br />Naturally, they gather hundreds of warriors from neighboring tribes as they march on through snow, a jungle, as well as a desert.  And when they finally catch up to the abductors, they just happen to find thousands of slaves being used to build the great pyramids (Apocalypto!).  Before they are able to gather all of their strength, and convince the slaves to revolt, one of the members from the village is sacrificed (Apocalypto!).<br /><br />Eventually the overthrow happens, the bad guys lose and their leader suffers a demoralizing death (Apocalypto!), the good guys use their previously established hunting tricks against their enemies (Apocalypto!), and the star returns to his home to begin anew (Apocalypto!).<br /><br />The movie is incredibly worthwhile, told fairly well, with superb acting and action.

B000UNYJXQ|5.0|I have seen this decline in our system for years.  Being exposed to the medical field for so many years I always knew \\"wrong doing\\" was going on but this film finally gave me the details of \\"why or how\\".  Maybe the insurance system started out as a positive thing at first but like everything else in our government it gets corrupted.  If the American people demanded printed out statements just like a business does for its own accounting of where each earned dollar goes, we would be a much stronger country.  Do you ever think laws or control of our tax money will go in effect? Heck no, because the exact people who are making the laws are the ones pocketing the money.  You think not, then you are a fool. I had a politician in our family and many high ranked, retired military that knows very well what goes on and it made them SICK.  As they put it, they call it the \\"Government Mafia\\". One time my uncle was asked how much of a cut he wanted for something he was buying for his state. He was clueless what the heck they were talking about. Someone pulling him aside and told him how it works and he can make thousands for himself from the tax payers money. Since he was an honest man and truly believed NO ONE should ever make politics their career. He always ran his business and stayed close to the people when he put his time in as a Senator.  He wanted to make a different for a few years then go back to his normal life.  After what he learned what really goes on in the government he knew there will never be grand changes. It is getting worse and worse each year.  There are many examples of great things we start, small examples are,lotteries or wheel tax on your car plates. Started out real good, went to roads, went to the schools but in a short 5 to 10 years you would be lucky to see 10% going to where it is suppose to and the rest is unaccounted for, all gone in thin air. We have no right to even ask where the other 90% went either.  There was a comment in the movie from other countries, \\"Europe is afraid of the people,yet in America the people are afraid of the Government\\"  How true.<br />Working in the medical field I see the non working, or non-citizens getting better care and treatment for free.  Soon all the good hard working people are just going to move out of here. Lets see how powerful this country will be then. In my state, the free government health insurance has better benefits and cover more than paid insurance. For me, I have not had health insurance for my children and I for years. Why? my job does not offer it (even if it did it would cost me almost more than a monthly car payment would PLUS many are going to 1000.00 deductibles).  I make about 1,500 a year too much to get any help. This movie is SO on target!  You may want to not believe it, that is your choice or could be from conditioning from the government of the lies they try to make you believe.  They are scared, they do not want to loose their thousands of dollar bonuses and kick backs for not putting laws and regulations on ares like pharmaceutical companies.  We have many laws so companies can not be a monopoly etc., but you will not see any laws on medical supplies. It has became a second income for our government and a very good one at that.  Bad thing is everyone in office wants in on the action so it gets higher and higher to pay everyone off. Other bad thing is they have total control to prove the system will not work. All they have to do is jack up our taxes so HIGH (even though they DO NOT need that much and just waste the money to in proving a point) that we THINK universal medicine was not the right answer. They can manipulate it anyway they want so we will want paid health insurance again. If the government is the one filling their pockets on this great invention called health insurance who do we go to and get it fixed?  Feels hopeless, but it is not. As a whole we can do it BUT in America we are too busy working 2 and 3 jobs to make ends met (unlikeFrance) to do anything about it.  We need to wake up for the future of our country and our children.nce) to do anything about it.  We need to wake up for the future of our country and our children.
1897299192|4.0|Tove Jansson's Moomin is a delight and a pleasure. The characters are beautifully drawn and interact with complex human emotions, but their stories are told in such a simple way that children can enjoy the book quite easily.  This comes HIGHLY recommended.
0307388840|5.0|It's odd that a book with so little action taking place can be so gripping. It was truly hard to put this book down, despite the fact that page after page is spent on character reflection.<br /><br />Atonement follows the story of Briony Tallis, who witnesses the beginning of a love affair between her sister and the son of a charlady. But, being thirteen and prone to a vivid imagination, Briony's interpretations of what she sees causes her to accuse her sister's lover of a criminal act. This accusation goes on to change everyone's life, Briony's included. All of this is backdropped by the coming of World War II.<br /><br />While at heart this seems to be a story about a young girl ruining lives due to her own ignorance, or the story of two lovers torn apart by circumstance, at heart this is a novel about the act of writing, about characterization, narrative development, and the act of an author playing God in the world he or she has created. It is for that reason that the long passages of character reflection are so engaging. This book asks the question, how can you atone for sins in a world that you created, where you are God and answer to no one?<br /><br />I felt at times that the extended opener to the story dragged just a little--that at times McEwan tried to draw out the dramatic and tension in a scene to beyond its breaking point. There are also some who might find the ending completely unsatisfying in its lack of concrete answers. This is not a cut-and-dry war-time romance piece, so anyone looking for a story of that nature need not pick this up. But for anyone interested in the art of writing--whether you're a writer yourself or just an avid reader--this book is simply not to be missed.
B0000C0FJB|2.0|Um but ISN'T THAT THE JOB OF THE ENGINEER?!?!    Insane performance. Insane Brazilians. What else can you expect?
B00003CXAA|5.0|Obviously this box set is going to be incredible.  The Godfather series is classic, and anyone would be happy with this purchase.  Perfect gift for that special guy in your life!
B000AMPZF8|5.0|I bought this album a few years ago after buying Absolution and Showbiz. What surprised me was how this was by far their best album. This album has a much darker feel and uses distortion alot more without a single weak track:     1. New Born 10/10. An amazing intro track which starts in a quiet piano riff and turns into a loud and distorted guitar riff. Grabs you at first listen with his amazing vocals.     2. Bliss 8/10. Matt Bellamy claimed that he was attempting to mix in dance music with their original sound. Although that's not the case the song is still very good but doesn't stand out that much on such an amazing album.     3. Space Dementia 9/10. Sounds very classical and has a great piano ostinato (AKA riff) mixed in with Matt's sinister vocals wailing 'You make me sick, because I adore you so' and then goes in to an electronic chorus. The ending drags on a bit but with great dramatical affect.     4. Hyper Music 10/10. Once the song starts its twisted riff with Matt oohing manically in the background you may assume that this song is very dark, but then it stops and becomes very light with Matt chorusing like a wounded angel. This song goes in and out of these styles throughout the song. It sounds amazing.     5. Plug in Baby 10/10. The most famous song on the album. The riff kind of speaks the entire song for itself. Powerful and complex(ish).     6. Citizen Erazed 10/10. Kicks in with a powerful bass and a screeching guitar. With all that going on Matt just has to sound like he's slightly sane. Then they go into a chorus where he shows how high he can go (for now) and the bass/guitar duet beginss again. Then there's a middle part when it gets all quiet and Matt says 'wash me' and some other stuff. Then it continues. It's seven minutes of this. Sorry if I killed the song for you.     7. Micro Cuts 10/10. This is when Matt gets falsetto (high). Really falsetto. Operatic falsetto. Women operatic falsetto. It sounds eccentric and is one of the best songs on the album.     8. Screenager 8/10. Very quiet and subtle and in contrast to the other insanity doesn't seem special. But give it time and the creepy guitars will grow on you. I promise.     9. Darkshines 9/10. Starts off cowboy like and then gets quiet. He then beats up a piano and then starts the chorus. That's about it but it's better than screenager.     10. Feeling Good (Oh no! A cover!) 8/10. Don't worry it's not that awful. He wails into microphone which makes me laugh (no offense).     11. Megalomia 8/10. Starts quiet bursts into the chorus with an organ. The ending could have been better but still...     If you want to like Muse for their talent buy this album. If for their commercialism buy Black Holes and Revelations and hope they never make something that commercial again. Or buy both I don't care.
0345347951|5.0|-- REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS --    The story starts with alien ships flying into the Earth's atmosphere and parking themselves over the major cities of the world. The ships remain over the cities doing nothing, just waiting and letting the poor, scared humans running around like rats. Then, they announce themselves via radio. They don't show themselves -- they just communicate. The United Nations Secretary-General is the only contact between the aliens, actually one alien, and humanity. The meeting occurs in a room in one of the space ships. This one lonely human never sees the alien, but the alien sees him through what turns out to be a two-way mirror.    The story progresses with the aliens ending war, animal cruelty, bigotry, etc. The the human race has entered a golden age -- but the aliens still do not reveal themselves. The head alien promises they will reveal themselves in 50 years. At this point, one of the characters observes that in 50 years humanity will have forgotten all about freedom and only remember the *good* new days.    Fifty years pass, humanity has peace and prosperity. Now the day has come for the aliens to reveal themselves. On that day all the ships that have existed over all the cities disappear, except for one. It turns out all the ships, except for that one, were projections -- fakes. A small ship comes from the mother ships and lands. The door opens and out steps an alien with wings, a tail with a diamond shaped end and horns. Some people faint -- they have seen the devil, or what appears to be the devil.    The story continues. People now accept the Overlords, as the aliens are called. The Overlords move freely among us humans. They talk to us, help us, lend us their tools, and -- they study us. The Overlords are mental giants compare to humans. They control nature as humans could or would never have been able to control.    One night at a party, attended by both Overlords and humans, a Ouija games starts. People are asking questions andthe Ouija board is answering. One of the humans, a physicist, asks a question -- where do the Overlords come from? The answer is something like, NGC blah, blah, blah. Meaningless gibberish to the average human, but to our hero the physicist, it's an astronomer's catalog entry pointing to a star. The physicist does not understand the source, a woman in a trance playing with a Oiuja board, but he does know what it means. He has knowledge and intends to use it.     Our physicist hero manages to stowaway on an Overlord ship and actually travels to one their planets. The Overlord home world, or better, an outpost, is 40 light-years away. This means that because the Overlord ship travels near the speed of light and time *slows* down on the ship relative to Earth, the physicist has only aged a few months, but more than 40 years have passed on Earth. When our hero returns to Earth after another few month journey for him, but another 40 years back home on Earth, he finds a world that is almost dead.     The Overlords reveal to the physicist their real mission -- to prepare the human species, the children really, to take the next step in *their* evolution. However, this is a lie. The Overlords came to Earth to prevent humanity from developing psychic powers (suspension of disbelief is required here). Unchecked, humanity would have spread like a cancer among the stars the Overlords say. So they stopped us. They gave us what we wanted most, what we craved -- peace and contentment, and they waited for the real master to show up.    The children begin to change. They start losing their personalities, they lie around doing nothing. Their little personalities are lost. The older children take longer since they have more memories. Babies are lost almost immediately -- but to what? The reason is a galactic mind, the Overmind as the Overlords call it. The Overmind absorbs races, only certains races. The race's children slowly lose their individuality and become part of a larger hive mind. This takes decades to happen. In the end nothing is left of the individual minds, just a group mind which becomes part of the larger Overmind.    While this so-call evolution occurs, humanity dies. Without children, there is no future. Humanity and society collapses into chaos and dies. By the time the physcist returns to earth only the children are left, living in Australia separated from the rest of the planet. At this point, one of the Overlords makes the statement that he would have put the remaining humans out their misery, but it was not what they do. How nice.    The Overlords, even with all their technology and representing the ultimate in individuality, are trapped. They cannot take the final step to join the Overmind. They lack the psychic component that allows humans to take this step. The Overmind, even with all it's power, still needs the Overlords to prepare species for the final step, the step to individual oblivion, but galactic consciousness.     In the end, our physicist hero stays on earth as it is destroyed during the final step as the now *evolved* children transform into pure mind. The Overlords continue trying to learn why they cannot take the final step and hoping to free themselves or join of the Overmind.    The Overlords are really the ultimate hyprocrites. They destroy entire races, billions of lives, so the Overmind can absorb the children. As they do the Overmind's dirty work, the Overlords sit there and pity themselves -- envious of a trip they cannot make. Other species are sacrificed and die so the Overlords can study the Overmind. How interesting -- the Overlords put a complete end to all animal cruelty on Earth (a bull fight has a very interesting result), but they, the Overlords, are guilty of the ultimate *animal* cruelty -- destroying entire *lower* races for the benefit of a galactic parasite.     The story is one of Arther C. Clarkes best. In my opinion, far better than 2001.
B00001SIES|4.0|Back when Muse were younger they belonged to Maddona's label Maverick. Which made this more poppy. But it's still very good. The only problem is the arrangement of the album.     1. Sunburn 10/10. Great piano ostinato (AKA riff) and evil vocals from Matt. The chorus is also very evil and never tires throughout the song.     2. Muscle Museum 10/10. Very intersting guitars (they sound Italian but I could be wrong) intersting vocals 'I have played in every toilet, but you just want to spoil it' and the mix of vocals and guitar at the end is pure genius. Sounds very epic.     3. Filip 7/10. I assume that this is Maverick's doing because it starts off very poppy. The chorus is okay and there is a point where it goes slow and Pink Floydy. Fortunately this is the worst song of the album.     4. Falling Down 8/10. The chorus is Pink Floydy and the rest of the song sounds Bluesey. A grower.     5. Cave 9/10. Distorted guitars, emotional vocals and an instumental part near the end showing that Muse has potential for great things.     6. Showbiz 9/10. Has a crescendo (gradually getting louder) of drums and then bursts in with screeching guitars and screeching Matt. A very good song.     7. Unintended 9/10. A quiet song that sounds all lovey. Depends what mood you are in really but Matt seems very in love with something.     8. Uno 10/10. Starts off in an explosion of distorted sound and then turns into a rocky tango getting louder in the chorus. They did say they liked Flamenco music.     9. Sober 9/10. This song makes me laugh so much when he does the keyboard solo. It sounds just like John Shuttleworth (if you know who he is you'll understand). Besides that it's a pretty cool song.     10. Escape 9/10. Matt says your unlovable, then says he doesn't care. Regardless though this song is very emotional with some decent guitaring in it.     11. Overdue 10/10. For some reason I like this song. It explodes in with loads of sound then goes quiet with Matt singing like an unhappy schoolgirl. A great song regardless of its simplicity.     12. Hate this song and I love you 8/10. A quiet and sound effect filled end. They may have overdone it a bit but Matt is singing well so that kind of balances it out.     Muse were not famous at all at this point. Therefore you know this album is trying to get your attention. Let it talk to you and you won't regret it (unless you listened to Origin of Symetry first then you may be disapointed)
B0012QE4OO|4.0|It cracks us up how much money this film made, but yet most reviews are neagative.    What movie did these bozos go see?    What we saw was a rollercoaster ride of a movie that felt fresh and exciting. C'mon, man! Sam Jackson, baby! He was cool as the paladin leader with Anakin Skywalker as the jumper. (We actually liked the european bad boy jumper somewhat better! Good actor.)    JUMPER had loads of mystery and action/adventure excitement - as well as a huge surprising ending - that will leave you wanting more. Liman yet again proves he is a top-notch director. We loved his original Bourne movie. The first beat the other two by leaps and bounds! (The last one was a total bore fest!)    And then, with Mr. and Mrs. Smith he took the comedy/action genre and sent it through the stratosphere! Although Jumper isn't as great as that last film, it is still WAY better than most junk coming out these days, all geared towards teens.    Sure Jumper leaves open questions at th end. There are several books out in this series, and Hollywood loves a sequel. And we want one!     And we'll bet every reviewer who gave this movie bad marks would go see it too! One way or another.    Sure the movie had its problems, but director Doug Liman handles the movie in a quick pacing with loads of beautiful special effects, great action sequences that were very original and huge in scope. Very refreshing. Also, if you want to see some of the most impressive sights in the world, Jumper takes you there!    Excellent movie, despite its few quirks. We'll buy the DVD, and hope to see an even bigger and better sequel in the future.    With all the money this film made, that should not be a problem.
B00009V7T2|5.0|After the hardcore years of At the Drive In it feels really refreshing to listen to something so insane and full of ideas. All of the musicians pulled their weight even Flea (bassist of RHCP). It does take a few listens to sound amazing but it is worth the wait.     1. Son Et Lumiere 8/10. Synthesisers and keyboards are used to create an atmosphere when Cedric's voice appears like an alien in the background. Then the drums and guitars keep bursting and disappearing again and again until silence...     2. Inertiatic Esp 10/10. The chorus explodes into action with such emotion and power. Although half of the things Cedric says are pure gibberish they are said with such feeling why care? After the chorus verse combo the guitars start making some distorted sounds for a while and then for a few bars it's only guitar until the chorus explodes into action again. This song got me into Mars Volta and is one of the best songs on the album.     3. Roulette Dares (The Haunt Of) 8/10. Starts off absolutely insane with sound flying everywhere but then calms down loads with Cedric quietly whispering in falsetto until the chorus 'exoskeletal junction at the railroad delayed' the chorus sounds commercial but who cares. It then swings from insane to calm for the rest of the song. You may have noticed a bit of an instrumental section from Omar (guitarist) at one point. Get used to it because there are alot more of them.     4. Tira Me A Las Aranas 7/10. Just an instrumental link with some sinister keyboards and guitars. It builds up to...     5. Drunkship Of Lanterns 9/10. Very fast drumming with marracas. And random guitar notes with Cedric shouting 'Is anybody there?' starts off insane and stays insane. One of my favourite parts is when the guitar goes from plain accoustic to electric distorted for a few bars. The chorus (at least I think it's a chorus) reminds me of Jeff Buckly a little.     6. Eriatarka 9/10. Starts very calm and whenever chorus1 came in they would suddenly get faster and slightly louder. After a while they reach chorus2 at which point they remain loud and insane until it fades at the end. Pretty good.     7. Cicatriz Esp 9/10. Starts off like they are in space with Cedric singing like a man on the edge and Omar making minor chords. Then it goes silent for a few seconds and explodes with the chorus 'I'M DEEEFECTIVE!' after a few of these there is a very very very long instrumental part that starts off barely noticable but then gets louder (reminds me of Yes). It then ends how it started twelve minutes later. What a journey.     8. This Apparatus Must Be Unearthed 10/10. I like this song because it is distorted and dark. Cedrics put his voice through a machine of some kind because he sounds like a broken robot. Near the end it sounds like the CD's got stuck but wait about 30 seconds and you'll realise it's all part of their crazy plan.     9. Televators 8/10. One of the singles and is very laid back. It may sound more boring because of the lack of energy but what they lack on energy they increase on emotion. Especially with that organ based chorus.     10. Take The Veil Cerpin Taxt 10/10. THE BEST SONG!!! The guitars start off twisted with Cedric sounding twisted. Then there's the beautiful chorus which works so well with the atmosphere. A bit later it goes quiet and then there is an insane instumental masterpiece by Omar and the drummer and keyboards (and Flea). Until the seond chorus explodes in. Then Cedric gets amnesia and starts asking 'Who brought me here?' A MUST LISTEN.     11. Ambuletz 9/10. Most people think that this bonus track is pointless and doesn't go with the album; I disagree. The concept (man in drug induced coma fighting his good and evil side) goes well with this because it sounds like he is back on the drugs again. A lot of weird sounds involving some evil giggling and gurgling.     If you like experimental music that tries to push the boundaries. Then it is likely you have already bought this, and if not it's not to late to buy it now pleeeeeeeeeeeease.
B000YEUUCK|5.0|I tried to see the show in Vegas many times, but always sold out.  This is the next best thing to being there.  Celine is the most fantastic entertainer. She keeps the show moving and her voice is beyond compare.  I also liked the behind the scenes video, not many times you can get into the entertainers world.    BLU-RAY IS FANTASTIC!
B00004YRQA|4.0|All you need to know is that this is a card that will save your progress on PS2 games. With plenty of memory you can take it to someone elses PS2 and load your progress onto it instead of internal memory which is just stuck to its own console.     ...its a card with memory you don't need to read a review about it do you?
1596009209|4.0|I love Harry Bosch, and this novel doesn't disappoint.  It leaves you guessing up to the end as to 'who dunnit'.  If you love crime stories, this one will thrill.  Highly recommend this one.
B000AMJDHY|4.0|When I got this album I was still finding out what kind of music I liked. And I've got to say that this genre isn't exactly my favourite (being more into experimental music) I will still rate this album fairly regardless of the commercialism.     1. Introduction 5/10. Some random static and a voice that links to the next song...     2. Only Difference Between Martyrdom and Suicide Is Press Coverage 8/10. A catchy song with a good chorus and is quite interesting at the end.     3. London Beckoned Songs About Money Written by Machines 8/10. PATD singing about their fame and that the weather has something to do with critics, very intersting lyrics.     4. Nails for Breakfast, Tacks for Snacks 7/10. Not a very interesting track and the chorus isn't particulary catchy but an OK song nonetheless.     5. Camisado 8/10. A strong song with the chorus 'Can't take the kid from the fight take the fight from the kid.' Very good.     6. Time to Dance 9/10. A nice synthy beginning with Brendon singing with a nice hint of emotion. Shotgun wedding.     7. Lying Is the Most Fun a Girl Can Have Without Taking Her Clothes Off 9/10. Like the other song full of emotion but slighlty less complex and has a better chorus.     8. Intermission 6/10. Some random piano... but it's an intermission so I can't say much about it can I?     9. But It's Better If You Do 9/10. The single about the burlesque. It's very simple so all you need to know is that it's burlesque themed.     10. I Write Sins Not Tragedies 10/10. It doesn't get ten just because it's the song that everyone's heard but because it was the first one I heard three (yes THREE!!!) years ago. Has interesting lyrics about a wedding gone wrong and is very catchy.     11. I Constantly Thank God for Esteban 8/10. A basic song with a catchy chorus...what more can I say?     12. There's a Good Reason These Tables Are Numbered Honey, You Just Haven't... 9/10. Has an interesting them to it and sounds very jazzy. Something about Brendon being aCancer...well I'm a Libra.(sorry that was cheesy)     13. Build God, Then We'll Talk 10/10. Starts off nice and weird about intimacy and then has some loud chellos near the end.     If you're into this music then be my guest and buy but don't attack me for not being interested in this music; not everyone likes the same thing.
B001041JLE|3.0|If you're a Michael Jackson fan there is a chance you already own the original Thriller album. If you are an ocasional fan (like me) this is a good opportunity to own a history making album in a nifty shiny cover. The extra material is a few bits of dialogue by Vincent Price (not very impresive) and a original unreleased song from that time (which is nice). The \\"new version\\" songs are not that good. Only one of them feels like a new take on the original song, the rest are basically remixes with no soul or feel to them whatsoever.   From a collector point of view sure, buy it. From a fan that wishes to own the original Thriller sure, buy it. For somebody wanting to hear new takes on old MJ songs, not a good investment.
B000FVQYYK|2.0|...now I wrote this review on the UK amazon and got voted down...alot...but I think this needs to be said...    ...the album Origin of Symetry literally changed the way I thought about music (before you say anything I'm not that old) and absolution and showbiz tie in for a close second...mainly because absolution tried many different styles even though some worked and some didn't...and showbiz was a very good debut but the mainstream production (thank you maverick) and the randomness of the song order spoiled it ever so slightly (I think sunburn would have done better nearer the end...) and then we have this...muse always want to try new things...and what do we get? Some commercial drivel...Origin of Symetry grabbed me in one listen...showbiz in two and absolution in three...I listened to this about 8 times only to be appalled at the commercialness...and what's more you have magazines like NME supporting them for creating such an awful awful (in my opinion) and also uncomplex (descending scales in Knights of Cydonia...really? Wow...) um...crap basically...and let me show you why...    Take a Bow 6/10: Showbiz started with a piano ostinato...as did Origin...absolution started with marching...then a piano ostinato...so although it's nice that instead they started with a bass that reminds me of an aeroplane...the lyrics \\"Corrupt your corrupt/you destroy all that you touch\\" anti political? Um...not really...then it goes dance(ish) but unlike Bliss doesn't keep any interest...and gets boring...    Starlight 7/10: Now I'll admit there were times when I thought this song was good; the pianos were soothing and Matts voice went pretty well with the distorted bass line...and then the explosion of synthy keyboards...followed by repeating the name of the album...then it's more or less the same...a pretty good concept but the radio over played this song so much I can't stand it...Matt's voice sounded slightly more annoying then I first thought and hearing the piano makes me wantto find some prozac and flush it down the toilet (pointless metaphor #67)...but yes....it's all about what music you like...it's too poppy for me...    Super massive Black Hole 6/10: Another song the radio decides to kill...along with MTV2...which is a shame because Floria made the video very dark and sinister...but Matt's cheesy falsetto lyrics just don't work...this is the kind of stuff you'd hear at a club trying to say \\"Yeah we like rock music too look we played Moose...I mean Muse...\\" And glaciers melting in the dead of night...is he singing about an innuendo or is he trying to be political again I just don't know...my instinct says I shouldn't care but my common sense says...this has all been done before and I expected more from muse...    Map of the Problematique 6/10: Ugh...dry...very bland...I think they're trying to be atmospheric...which they could if they weren't so relient on a mix of synths and pianos...I'd expect this from mediocore bands...not muse...    Soldiers Poem 4/10: I sense someone trying to make a new Blackout...which I thought still wasn't a great song but it had it's moment of touchingness...two minutes long...something about soldiers in Iraq but it's too short to pay attention...songs like this need time to progress...    Invincible 6/10: They say this song was inspired by David Bowie...well I don't know much of his work so I can't really say...but it kind of moves in this dreary and calm cheery manner...it feels like there's going to be a cliax...and then there's a key change and suddenly this vaguely interesting solo...it's fast but remains in the key we were already in...therefore I don't feel that interested...sorry...my expectations of muse were too high...I'm so arrogant...    Assasin 8/10: Hmm...yes...ok...I see...probably the best song in my opinion...so I'll keep it a surprise...oh what joy suspense gives...not really...    Exo Politics 7/10: Wow...very simple riffs...a guitar solo that follows after the second chorus...predictable? Yes...but it is done pretty well and would be acceptable...not until our leaders tell us why? I see...my sarcasm is irritating me now...    City of Delusion 7/10: My opinion about this song changes alot...not inspiring when I heard it...but when seen live the chorus did indeed feel much more epic...but of course the epyleptic light show did help that...on the album the big explosion in the chorus just isn't as grand as you think it would be...and kind of hits the tipof the jug without knocking it over (pointless metaphor #96)...good live...mediocore otherwise...but of course Muse become gods when they're live...    Hoodoo ?/10: ...um...I forgot what this song sounded like...this was probably the reason I got voted down so much due to inaccuracy but obviously if it didn't stand out would I want to listen to it again?    Knights of Cydonia 6/10: ...well...what to say...it's a cowboy themed spae man ninja (thus the music video)...and yes it has a lot of notes and it has a mosh worthy part...but it's just a descending scale and doesn't interest me as much as it should...hmm...yes it's an ok song...but not the best choice for GH3 either...I would hae used plug in baby...    ...so all in all...yes I don't like this album...I don't like the way they sound slightly like Rush (PLEASE PLEASE DON'T TELL ME THEY DON'T I ONLY SAID SLIGHTLY) and it's commerical...I would advise you to buy Origin of Symetry first...as that is where the spacey proggy journey starts and peaks...can you vote me down more then the UK...they voted me down 17 times...I'd like to see you try and beat the stereotype...weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee...
B00069FLC2|5.0|As a big Shadows fan dating back to the sixties I found this to be a good DVD. Fifty years on, their sound is still as good as ever. This is a very enjoyable concert to see and listen to especially in DTS. This is a have to have DVD for any music collection. A real foot tapper!!?? go \\"Apache\\" The Bonus feature has an interview with Hank Marvin, Bruce Welch and Brian Bennet which is very interesting as you hear their comments on starting up joining Cliff Richard and how the band went through some turbulent times etc but were still able to carry on. With a total time of 180 minutes this DVD is geart value.
B0001LJC2K|4.0|I'll admit it would be difficult to top Origin of Symetry. But this album is still amazing it just takes more time and has a few more disapointing tracks:     1. Intro 7/10. Hard to rate an intro but they could have made it better. A crescendo (gradually getting louder) of marching with some guy saying something and then...     2. Appocalypse please 8/10. Crazy pianos with Matt claiming it is the end of the world. Don't knock it until you've heard it a couple of times.     3. Time is running out 9/10. The popular song that gets everyone cheering in a live performance because all the posers only remember that song. Starts quiet and electronic and builds up to a rocky chorus. Mainstream but good.     4. Sing for absolution 9/10. Very calm and creepy pianos with some high echoey vocals from Matt. It's very atmospheric and has a gargly guitar solo near the end. One of the growers.     5. Stockholm Syndrome 10/10. Amazing beginning riff with Matt wailing emotionally. But then the chorus along with a piano and choir comes in and it feels really beautiful. If you don't like this song I'd suggest a different album. One of the highlights.     6. Falling away with you 9/10. It starts off quiet and then explodes into a chorus with a chirpy guitar. Another grower.     7. Interlude 8/10. Well it's better than the intro. A guitar version of some opera which I've forgotten the name of.     8. Hysteria 10/10. One of Chris' best bassline quick and menacing. The guitars are great and Matt sings with power. The chorus is a bit simple though...oh well. Will grab you instantly.     9. Blackout 7/10. Very quiet. This song didn't do it for me and that's a shame because it sounds okay. I'll let you be the judge.     10. Butterflies and Hurricanes 9/10. Matt uses piano mainly on this track which is a refreshing change. He belts it out alot but deep down it reminds me of Queen's 'we are the champions' (don't ask why). Has a small piano solo as well which is pretty good.     11. The Small Print 10/10. Guitars are good and rocky and then Matt sings with great emotion. Short and sweet.     12. Endlessly 5/10. A filler. Keyboard is used but emotion hasn't been put into this track.     13. Thoughts of a dying atheist 9/10. A creepy song with Matt saying 'It scares the hell out of me!!!' A good song and has a interesting bawling guitar solo.     14. Rule by secrecy 4/10. Why carry the album on when it is fine as it is? Disapointingly dry and lack of anything in particular.     A very good attempt by Muse and one of their best. It would come second to Origin of Symetry but still has more of a variety of sounds whether they work or not.
B001041JLE|5.0|I WAS 13 Y.O WHEN THE ORIGINAL THRILLER WAS REALESED. I GREW UP WITH MJ AND  25 YEARS LATER IT'S STILL THE BEST RECORD OF ALL TIMES!!!!!!!!  NOW EVEN BETTER!!!!!!!!!!
B000002C1W|4.0|\\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\\" is the first post-Roger Waters version of Pink Floyd.  The cd does not maintain the consistent quality of their mega-cds such as \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\", \\"Wish You Were Here\\" or the commercially successful \\"The Wall\\".  However, the cd contains several songs that capture the essence of the Pink Floyd style, if not quite having the same substance.  \\"Learning to Fly\\", \\"One Slip\\" and \\"Sorrow\\" contain the quintessential Pink Floyd mixture of keyboards, percussion, and signature vocals of past Pink Floyd.  \\"Sorrow\\" particularly captures the dark moodiness present in Pink Floyd's earlier works and a hidden treasure on the cd, containing excellent guitar work by David Gilmour.      \\"The Dogs of War\\" has grown on me, although it is a stripped, down light version of the typical Pink Floyd sound, lacking the musical complexity they are known for.  The same can be said about \\"On the Turning Away\\", which is pleasant enough and a nice break from the noisier songs on the cd. \\"Yet Another Movie/Round and Around\\" is a good track buried in the cd that never got much radio play.  The horns on \\"Terminal Frost\\" do not work and the song never really seems to find itself.    In the end, there is both enough of the traditional Pink Floyd sound and quality tracks on this digitally remastered cd to make this a worthy addition for any fan of Pink Floyd.
0446677450|3.0|I thought this book was an easy, entertaining read, written in a first-person narrative style.  If you are trying to find ways to change your financial lifestyle, or trying to find some inspiration and different perspectives on how someone else \\"made it\\" then this book is a worthwhile read.    At less than 200 pages and anywhere from $2 - $12 USD, it's a fairly inexpensive book to peruse.  I don't think he \\"dumbed down\\" anything; rather, he took a subject that many find confusing and intimidating, and radically simplified it.  That has a lot to do with how successful this (I think his whole \\"Rich Dad\\" series) has been.    Don't expect to find many / any specific \\"how to's\\" in this book; rather, read it to inspire you to action to find out about more ways to leverage your financial growth.  I think this is a good introductory text for anybody, but especially if you feel the least bit intimidated about financial growth and investing.    I recommend this book for beginners.
B000W1V5VU|5.0|...to the top reviewers who gave this a 3-star rating.  My take is this: If you enjoyed 11, and pretty much hated 12, you'll find 13 to be a perfect match of the style of 12 and the substance of 11.<br /><br />The thing I liked the most in Oceans 13 was the \\"cool factor\\".  While it is stylish, as 12 was (almost to a motion-sickness fault), it also features a lot of dialogue back and forth between the characters that clearly are having a great time being a part of this plot. The interaction and chemistry (not to mention inside jokes pertaining to their real-life celebrity personalities) is smooth and seamless, and the movie flows better than 11.<br /><br />Back again is the impossible theft scenario that unravels as the movie unfolds.  Granted, on second viewings the surprise is gone, but I found myself enjoying the scenery even more on additional viewings, and there are some genuinely funny moments that I missed the first time.<br /><br />I can't speak for everyone, but I loved it.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE!  It was very well done and I have watched it many times; love the actors.  I have several versions of this movie and this is by far my favorite.
B0002YLC24|3.0|This small film needs a second look.  More than ten years after they made Before Sunrise, [[ASIN:B00002E224 Before Sunrise] Delpy and Hawke meet again, this time in Paris.  Don't expect a travelogue, although there are some nice scenes around the Seine.  It's adult talk about their relationships, life since the first one-day meeting in Vienna, and it demands full attention.  It has more in common with \\"My Dinner with Andre\\" than the usual romance movie. It could not have taken many days to shoot and has the look and sound of dialogue that was off the cuff at times.  But for the most part it works and his earnestness and her quirkiness keep our interest.   It ends suddenly, but about the only way it could. Nice way to spend part of an evening.
0553805460|1.0|The book is written in the prose of a high school english student. So badly written and way out, it is just a total waste of time. Filled with boring profanity, not believable scenes. The quality of the book binding and paper is way better than the book.  Comic books are advanced reading compared to this pathetic piece of work. I feel like suing Batam Books for publishing such a piece of trash.
B0014Z4ON4|4.0|The details of new DVD editions of the three classic classic Indiana Jones movies with all-new special features have been announced.  They'll be available separately for the first time on DVD, or as a set.  They were previously only available on DVD as a set.<br /><br />The new releases will coincide with the new movie, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, which comes out on May 22nd.  They'll have new special features designed to introduce new Indy fans to the old movies, and to introduce old fans to the new movie.<br /><br />The Indiana Jones movies are George Lucas's recreation/update of the serialized adventures of the 1930s and '40s.  The original three movies were made in the '80s and set in the '30s.  They feature Harrison Ford as a mild-mannered archeology professor who moonlights as an adventurous seeker of priceless antiquities.  This takes him to exotic locations across the world, and gets him in some very tight spots of the kind that only a movie hero could get into, or out of.  He invariably finds himself opposed by dangerous men with evil plans for the powerful objects only he has the skills to recover.  There are elaborate set pieces with creepy critters, ancient traps, fights with weapons from bare hands to airplanes and tanks, and sometimes supernatural forces.  Along the way Jones manages to have some romance too.  Humor is a big part of the fun.<br /><br />This is the second in the series but is set one year earlier than the first Indy movie, Raiders of the Lost Ark, in 1935.  After barely surviving an attempt to acquire an antiquity in China, Indy finds himself in India with a woman friend and male sidekick (a trio as in all three films).  They're enlisted to recover a village's sacred Sankara stone and kidnapped children, both held by an evil man with designs to find and unite all five Sankara stones to rule the world.  This project involves ritual human sacrifice and an underground mine, each of which provide close calls for the heroes.<br /><br />This film, while incorporating light humor as before, is somewhat darker in overall tone than Raiders (reportedly by design, as Lucas and Speilberg were each in a dark mood after romance/marriage failures).  Not especially violent by current standards (PG, though it played a part in leading to the creation of the PG-13 rating), I think most kids and parents will be fine with it.  It's still all for fun.<br /><br />The creepy crawlies featured in this installment are lots and lots of exotic insects.<br /><br />If you don't want the whole set and don't want to wait until May, you could get a used copy of the old Temple of Doom DVD (people sell them out of the sets).  The difference is in the extra features.  The bonuses from the old set are on their own disc, so what you get when you buy just the old Temple of Doom DVD is pretty bare.  The new release, on the other hand, has the following, all new:<br /><br />-- \\"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom: An Introduction\\" by director Steven Spielberg and creator/producer George Lucas<br /><br />-- \\"Creepy Crawlies,\\" in which Spielberg, Lucas and co-producer Frank Marshall reminisce about snakes, bugs and rats<br /><br />-- \\"Locations,\\" on where the films were set and where they were actually shot<br /><br />-- storyboard sequence: \\"The Mine Cart Chase\\"<br /><br />-- DVD galleries of illustrations, props, production stills and portraits, FX/Industrial Light and Magic stuff, and promotion/marketing materials<br /><br />-- \\"Lego Indiana Jones,\\" a demo and trailer for a game based on the trilogy<br /><br />If you like a few extras, you'll probably prefer this new DVD, though maybe not enough to upgrade from the old one, or to wait until May.  I like audio commentaries, myself, and since they're easy to produce and tend to bring out points not covered in other features, I subtract one star for a special edition without any, but I look forward to the rest.  If you don't care about commentaries, this may be a five-star DVD for you.<br /><br />There have been rumors of deleted scenes, but none are included.<br /><br />Some will want to wait for a high-def release, which makes sense if you have the equipment or plan to get it.  Many speculate that a Blu-ray release will come out for Christmas, but that's sheer guesswork.<br /><br />There's also some speculation that an even better edition with all four movies will soon supersede this new DVD.  The four movies may get bundled, but I doubt that there will be a better edition of this movie soon, if ever, on standard DVD.  Keep in mind that the previous set came out over four years ago, and if not for the new movie, it would probably still be the only release in the over ten years of the DVD era.  The next upgrade may be high-def only, and may not happen for a while.<br /><br />If you do want the whole trilogy (highly recommended), the new release is [[ASIN:B0014Z4ONE here]], the old set is [[ASIN:B00003CXC5 here]].  If you want to pick up one of the others from the new set, the new edition of Raiders of the Lost Ark is [[ASIN:B0014Z4OMU here]], Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade [[ASIN:B0014C2FX8 here]].ant to wait for a high-def release, which makes sense if you have the equipment or plan to get it.

0393039765|1.0|Sorry this is not a review, it's more a complaint. It's the second book I recieve from you with the pages badly cut. How can you deliver a book in that state? And please don't tell me that I can send it back, that would be really a nuisance... my time is valuable. I'm afraid that I don't feel like buying anything more from you, thank you...
B000WZAE1I|5.0|Great, fun movie.  I read the book before seeing the movie, and I thought the movie was better than the book!  That doesn't happen too much for me.  The cast performed superbly.  The story is charming and entertaining.  I think any 8 year old would find it great as well.  I particularly liked the movie device of having the ghosts of the dead brothers be a secondary audience of the film (similar to the two old guys in the balcony for the old Muppets show).
1400082773|5.0|I found this to be a very well written book and excellent page turner.  Mr. Obama must have spent a great deal of time writing this book with the extensive detail he included.  I have lived a somewhat sheltered life with hardly ever leaving Michigan, so I found it very interesting learning all the different areas of the world Mr. Obama has lived in, and all the different cultures he has encountered.  This is one part that made the book so great; learning about his times in Hawaii, Indonesia, Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, and Kenya.  What lands, what people he has seen, so intriguing.  Another part I found great about this book is Mr. Obama learning about his Kenyan family.  I found his Kenya trip most inspiring and emotional.  He really wanted to get to know his father's life and his father's family and he really wanted to embrace his family in Kenya and his heritage.  I even had a tear in my eye as I read the last page of the book.  Mr. Obama wrote so passionately that he almost made me feel what he was feeling.  I cannot say enough complimentary things about this book; I felt a wide range of emotions reading this book.  No matter your political views, this is one book we call can enjoy.
B000065VA1|5.0|I know it's very 1980's but still, this CD has long lasting depth. I noticed the reviews on the first page are all by guys. I can't understand it since I believe \\"In your eyes\\" to be one of the most heartfelt love songs. I guess I'm just a hopeless romantic. But if a girl sang this song to me, my knees would no doubt buckle.    I was lucky enough to see Peter Gabriel live in San Francisco in Golden Gate Park at a WOMAD concert in around 1998. He energized the whole park. He brought out surprise guest Sinead O'Connor and they started immediately into a song. She got some boos because of her recent protest of the pope on SNL. He stopped the song and scolded someone near the stage saying, Don't do that here man! That's not cool.\\" The boos stopped and then he counted \\"on four\\", and they got right back into it where they left off!     I think this CD will go down as one of his best. It's hard to top.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|I loved this musical and I had been playing it one day when my granddaughters were over and they went home and were reciting the words and music to the movie.  I decided that they should have this.
B000000WJ2|4.0|No sense in comparing him to the Stones. No musician doing a solo album wants to sound like his signature band. This was just another project Richards did. Looking at it that way, I think it's pretty good. It's not his typical hard driving guitar licks. It's more melodic which I kind of like. The songs \\"Eileen\\" and Yap yap\\" are well written. \\"Wicked as it seems\\" is more reminiscent of his more typical songs with a strong guitar solo.  This seems like a concerted effort and although not his best,  I think it still deserves recognition as an interesting, different, and worth owning CD from Kieth Richards, who in my mind IS the Rolling Stones.
B000AP04OM|5.0|I saw this movie at a theater in Chicago when my husband of 39 years and I were dating.  My grandchildren now know and love this movie from watching it on TV.  When they learned the music to the movie I decided they should have it to watch whenever they wanted.  Good movie, good story, clean!!!!
0060007737|5.0|To be successful at branding is increasingly challening with so many media options and control of advertising shifting from the advertiser to the consumer. For anyone in business this book offers extremely valuable facts, case studies, experiences, and outcomes that will make them better informed about the process of branding and what they must do to be successful at getting the market place to believe and accept their product or business as a true brand. I would make this book mandatory reading for every college marketing curriculum and anyone who has a job with\\"advertising or marketing\\" in their position title. It is better than any text book.
B000VAPZM2|5.0|My granddaughters saw this on TV and learned all the music and words to the musical.  I had to get it for them.  They watch it all the time.  It's nice clean fun!
1401300529|5.0|After his early work on Vietnam 'The Best and the Brightest', this is another masterpiece from Halberstam. His mixture of battle narrative and character analysis is irresistible; one really cannot put it down after Chapter 1 on the Yalu River and China's entry into the Korean War. It is also provocative and convincing about the errors of the late 1940s and early 1950s that led to so much grief for the USA, indeed up to the recent bogdown in Iraq. Much of Halberstam reads like Titus Livius, especially the Roman historian's account of the war with Hannibal.
0452289963|1.0|Tolle's book contains many philosophical errors. His idea about relativism (page 70 is simply wrong.) Tolle's writing is wordy with very little substance. I gave up reading this intellectually empty book at page 72.  Best wishes to those who choose to go further.
B000ZN802W|4.0|I did not know this was based on a true story. How insane that someone would attempt this journey without the appropriate gear and necessary requirements to live out in the wild in total solitary. I guess it's a form of suicide and how sad it turned out for this young man. I was looking for a survival only type of story in the wild, and not the story that was presented here.  Still it is recommended. The music is great and plays a character in the story. See it with a friend or family and not alone.  Humans are not meant to live alone in this world.
B00005GL0R|5.0|WHAT CAN BE SAID. WHAT WORDS CAN EXPRESS ONE OF THE GREATEST MOST CREATIVE ALBUMS IN THE HISTORY OF POPULAR MUSIC. FOR ME, IT HAS NOW BECOME, THE MONA LISA. SORRY IF YOU DON'T AGREE! I HAVE NOW BEEN LISTENING TO THIS ALBUM SINCE 1967. BEING ONE OF THE LUCKIEST BABY-BOOMERS TO GROW UP LISTENING AND LOVING THE BEATLES SINCE 1963! THIS ALBUM IS ESSENTIAL TO ANYBODY WHO LOVES MUSIC, AND LOVES CREATIVITY IN MUSIC. WHEN YOU HEAR PEPPER FROM THE START, YOU GO THRU A MARVELOUS AND WONDEROUS MENTAL AND STIMULATING ADVENTURE. THE ALBUM IS LIKE A STORY THAT MAKES YOU RELAX, AND MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD ABOUT LIFE. FROM THE VERY BEGINNING WITH SGT.PEPPER, AND IN TO \\" WITH A HELP FROM MY FRIENDS, \\"LUCY IN THE SKY WITH DIAMONDS\\" IS LIKE A STORYBOOK SONG. \\"GETTING BETTER\\" IS A POSITIVE STATEMENT THAT THINGS IN LIFE WILL BE BETTER! ONE OF MY FAVOURITES IS \\"FIXING A HOLE\\". THE SOUND OF PAUL'S VOICE AND HARPSICHORD IS STUPENDOUS! \\"BEING FOR THE BENEFIT OF MR. KITE\\" ABSOLUTE GENIUS, THE SOUND OF A GREAT CIRCUS. ON SIDE 2 GEORGE MAKES US THINK A LITTLE AND TO REFLECT, \\"WITHIN YOU WITHOUT YOU\\". \\"WHEN I'M SIXTY-FOUR, YES PAUL WE STILL LOVE YOU. FINALLY \\"A DAY IN THE LIFE\\" THE FINAL SONG AND THE PEAK OF GENIUS! I HOPE THAT THE YOUNG PEOPLE OF TODAY WILL OPEN THEIR MINDS AND TRY TO APPRECIATE GREATNESS! JUST BECAUSE IT IS OLD DOES NOT MAKE IT BAD OR UNENJOYABLE! I GREW UP ADMIRING HUMPHREY BOGART AND HE HAD PASSED WHEN I WAS TWO. I REALLY RECOMMEND TO ALL YOUNG PEOPLE OUT THERE, TRY IT, YOU'LL LIKE IT! IT SURE IS WONDERFUL TO KNOW THAT THE FABS MADE MY LIFE WORTH LIVING,LONG LIVE THE FAB 4!
B000QUCNOK|5.0|\\"Perfume- The Story of a Murderer\\" holds true to the title.  I did not read the book, which probably was best because it would have spoiled the journey.<br /><br />The movie moves slow and seems longer than it probably is, but if you enjoy mystery, great acting, the strange, unusual, and an unpredictable ending...then this movie is for you.<br /><br />A young man who should have died minutes after birth lives.  The audience is made aware of his incredible sense of smell from the beginning, but trust me you will not be prepared for just how incredible his sense of smell really is as he get older.  After a hard and abusive life, the young man wants to make a perfume that is the world's finest.  He becomes intrigued with wanting to capture the essence of a woman's innocence and beauty which just happens to be found in lovely young virgins.  He achieves his goal and the rest is so unbelievable that you must see for yourself.<br /><br />The writer either has a sick and twisted mind or is just incredibly imaginative.  The movie left me speechless.  Very unpredictable.
B000BK1RNI|1.0|BEWARE! This CD is a top of the line FORGERY. Technical term Russian CD-R. These CDs are have been flooding the market. Especially places like Amazon and really bad on eBay. If you see a Mini Gate Fold LP Replica for a Buy-It-Now for under $20 there is a very good chance it is a fake.  I collect rare Cd and Japanese Lp Replica's. I strongly suggest that you read the sellers feedback before you purchase and Replica LP's. You would be surprised at what you will find from other buyers.  Also check the UPC number if it is given. They are also made up and if you do a search it will come back no match.
B000ULQV0W|5.0|After Pearl Jam's recent mediocre albums, Eddie Vedder decided to release a solo album for Into The Wild.  Very catchy songs that do not get old after many listens.  Every acoustic song on the record is very good, but the one harder rocking song \\"Far Behind\\" is my least favorite song on the record.  It's like all the lastest Pearl Jam albums which isn't saying much.  He has a kind of Johnny Cash tone to his voice, maybe he should cover some of his stuff for his next album, If he makes another one.
B0000AUHQT|4.0|I had the pleasure recently of re-reading the book and then watching both film versions. This version is definitely the one to watch. Not perfect by any means, the Robert Redford, Sam Waterston, Bruce Dern, and Mia Farrow version essentially captures the subtext of F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel of the vapid lifestyle of the rich before the 1929 crash. Thanks to a superior script by Francis Ford Coppola and great acting by the entire cast, the meanning of Fitzgerald's novel become very clear without overstating the obvious. This film is a perfect companion to any discussion of the novel. Reviewers who cannot see what Gatsby sees in the flighty Daisy miss the point of the novel.
0618918248|5.0|i found this book to be quite interesting. I did not read it, it was read to me by the author and i enjoyed it so much more because of Dawkins cool British accent! I used to be agnostic and now I am full blown atheist. So i can say this book has changed my view of the world and it was a success.     HIGHLY recommended read even if you are a person of faith (whichever)
B00144J6RO|5.0|Barack Obama's first book, though autobiographical, reads like a novel. I wanted to know what makes this man tick, and this book painted a straightforward and fascinating picture. After having been the first black President of Harvard Law Review, Obama wrote this book the year following his graduation from law school. Though I can't afford the signed, limited edition, I'm buying a another paperback to send to my Mom. It's a great way to learn a great deal about what's behind this remarkable, historic figure who has drawn millions of people -- young and old, men and women, all races, even all over the world. Next, I'm going to read Audacity of Hope!!
B000WCBPOG|3.0|If you are a Beatles fan and also love to discover new artists, this is the disc for you. These wonderful artists sing our old favorites in new and beautiful ways. Their voices are amazing and the fact that they stick to the meaning of the songs as well is fantastic. I would recommend this to anyone who loves Beatles sung by anyone.

B000ZLFALI|3.0|If you are a Beatles fan you will enjoy the way that their music was reinterpreted into visuals. This did not seem like a movie trying to make the Beatles fit in  somehow. You could tell the writer loves the Beatles and wrote the story around the songs and the era. It was beautifully flimed and told a great story. There are some amazing artists and they sing beautifully. The story is simple but it is well made. I enjoyed this a lot.
074325144X|4.0|I haven't completely implemented Chi Running but am headed in the right direction. Book is well written and easy to follow. I am really enjoying the book and it's goal of making running easier.
B0011FXLCC|5.0|Seventh Tree is definitely a departure from Goldfrapp's previous albums, as has been mentioned elsewhere numerous times; its appeal does not stem from the same place as the danceable, energetic tracks of Supernature and Black Cherry.  It's a beautiful, soft, and sweet work--for me, it may be the best since Felt Mountain.

B0011NVC9I|3.0|First of all I am a sword and sorcery buff so this type of movie is the type I like. When I saw the ads for this movie I was excited to see it. But when I bought it last night and inserted the DVD I discovered this movie was a \\"cartoon\\"!!!  Strike One. And the CG \\"actors\\" were no better than the \\"Final Fantasy\\" movie done a decade ago. While the faces were ok the feet and hands looked cartoonish.     The second strike was the deviation from the story. They soaped up the story and in doing so, the final result was less than it would have been if they had stuck to the original story. Net result was the story was weak and contrived. The first half as ok but the 2nd half was \\"out of gas\\".    The good part of this movie was the CG effects (other than the people). I am a sucker for sword/monster sequences....even if it was just a cartoon. And I found them pretty entertaining.    Would I have bought this if I had known it was a cartoon and had a weak story....nope. Should have iTuned this one.     One has to wonder if the LOTR \\"gold standard\\" will ever be achieved again. So far, nothing is even close.    From now on I am reading up on any potential purchase BEFORE I blindly buy it. If I had just come here first I wouldn't have wasted $23.
B0009MDPYM|5.0|Wow, the number and quality of negative reviews for this movie are amazing.  This is not Shakespeare.  What is very good about this movie:    Music.  I bought the Soundtrack and it's one of my favorites.    Action and special effects.  Very well done.    Story.  It's from a comic book, people.  It's fiction.  Fantasy/horror.  If this isn't your cup of tea, then skip it!    Acting.  No matter what you think of Keanu, the supporting cast is very good.  I think Keanu was perfectly cast in this, but I can see where some would disagree.    This movie is pulp fantasy.  It's well done, and I enjoyed it immensely.   So much that I've watched it 2 or 3 times and I still want to buy the DVD.    If you liked [[ASIN:B0002V7ODI Hellboy (Director's Cut)]] or [[ASIN:B000F6IOC0 Underworld - Evolution (Widescreen Special Edition)]] you'll really like this.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|This is a story of a street musician played by Glen Hansard in Dublin who has let a breakup with his girlfriend send him into a type of depression. He meets and develops a friendship with a Czech immigrant played by Mark&eacute;ta Irglov&aacute; who sells flowers on the street. They both share an interest in music and she is the catalyst that awakens him so that his life and music can begin to move forward.<br /><br />This is a new type of romance film where the music is not only great, but is also the star and tells us the story. The music itself is a lead character in this movie. This newfound friendship is the motivating force in pushing his music career. I like that the movie also gives us a small glimpse into the creative process of the music.<br /><br />It is hard to believe these two are not actors for they were so natural. It may be because they are musicians, so they were just acting naturally. This low budget film but the chemistry of the two main actors and music make it a must see film. I cannot remember the last time I bought a CD, but I will definitely consider buying the soundtrack to this movie.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|Never compare the movie to the book. You will only be disappointed. I loved this movie based on its own merits.
B0010V4TZU|1.0|Been a long time since we've had a disc this over-hyped with so little to back it up. I keep wanting to find something memorable on the CD, but it just isn't there. Thankfully, Vampire Weekend will be forgotten very soon and we'll get back to music that means something.
B000NA2776|5.0|Superb.  Simply superb.  Truly a major talent and an extremely well produced album.
B000OYC3J8|4.0|My stepdaughter actually turned me on to this group, she knew that I liked a lot of \\"CLASSIC\\" rock, and she thought this group had a sound like some of the older rock groups.  She had me listen to Seven Nation Army, and when I heard it I'm thinking do you really think I'm supposed to like this?  But the more I listend,the more I did become to like them.  I guess I compare them to Led Zeppelin, because Led Zeppelin put out so much great music with just three people.  Jack and Meg are also putting out a lot of great music with just two people.  Led Zeppelin never considered themself a tour group, because a lot of their work had to be done in the studio.  Jack and Meg do an excellent job touring.  They sound great playing live.  That said, I'm 50 plus and I love this entire album.  I think  there is a whole new market out there that the White Stripes would appeal to, so maybe some of you kids might have to force your parents to listen to them, especially if they like groups like Led Zeppelin.
B000VJAICK|4.0|Having been a fan of the Tremors series, there was a high expectation from the HD-DVD version of Tremors. Boy did this disc exceed my Expectations!!.    First of all, let me point out the best feature of the disc - the visuals.  Every scene is crystal clear in glorius 1080p. The sense of clarity and amount of detail found in this disc I have not seen in any other HD-DVD title to date, and I own over 20 titles. Lets say the amount of detail you can see now with this HD-DVD spoils the movie a little as things start to look fake, or you can see wires and cables along the ground. I guess thats one problem found with the re-release of older non-CGI movies to a high-def format.    As with most of these old movies, the sound was a bit lacking. It sounded like most of the movie was coming through stereo with little surround or bass action. Once again, the sound was crystal clear, just not much descrete surround seperation. The film was made in stereo, and thats where it stays for most of the movie.    If you wanted to purchase this film to show off your HD-DVD player, there are probably some better selections out there to choose from. If your a fan of the series, do NOT hesitate to pick yourself up a copy. This is the best way to see Tremors, in 1080p    So go pick up this Motherhumper, before the inhabitants of Perfection leave due to the Graboids!!    Rating 3.5 out of 5
B0012K1ILW|5.0|Great cd, does not follow any form, but It really works. Might put off people who go for the formulated sound, but to everyone else I would say, purchase right now!
B000GG4XHO|5.0|CONEY ISLAND BABY recorded after the debacle that was METAL MACHINE MUSIC, is Reed at his most accessible. Songs full of melody with real hooks to them, lyrics that are funny, poignant, and personal sung in a tone that varies from jaunty to haunting, this is Reed for people who are afraid of the Lou Reed they've heard about. There's still challenge here for one who listens closely, but it is covered by a veneer of polish and nostalgia. This   is a nice entry into Reed's long and eclectic career, and can be enjoyed by the casual or long time fan.  The extras are interesting add-ons, but the original 8 songs from the happy-go-lucky \\"Crazy Feeling\\" to the evocative title track hold together as well as anything Reed has ever done.

B0012Q94QW|4.0|I don't think anything about Roland Emmerich's \\"10,000 B.C.\\" is accurate, historically, geographically, or culturally. But who cares? I see these movies to be entertained, not to be enlightened. Indeed, this is Emmerich's most entertaining film since \\"Independence Day,\\" to say absolutely nothing of \\"Godzilla,\\" \\"The Patriot,\\" or \\"The Day After Tomorrow.\\" This isn't to say that it's a masterpiece or even that it's great. In all likelihood, it will be completely forgotten ten years from now. But as long as we do know about it, we might as well make the most of what it has to offer; \\"10,000 B.C.\\" is a mindless adventure epic that achieves exactly what it wants to achieve without laboring over complicated details. The special effects and the action effectively serve as padding for a story so paper-thin and routine that it goes well beyond an archetypal cliché.    How could I possibly recommend a film like that? That's easy: I knew ahead of time to not expect cinematic genius. If you hope to get anything out of it, I recommend you do the same thing. Not that there's much to get out of it, anyway. The story is about as simple as they get, boiling down to a hero on a journey to save the woman he loves. Taking place in the distant past (and you'll forgive me if I don't take the film's title seriously), it begins when a young girl is brought to live among the people of a mountain tribe. As the sole survivor of massacre, she sets into motion a prophecy stated by the wise elder, called Old Mother (Mona Hammond)--a warrior will prove himself upon the return of the now-elusive mastodons, meaning that the girl will forever be his. But this will not happen for a long time, so naturally, years pass for the sake of the story. As adults, the girl--Evolet (Camilla Belle)--and the destined warrior--D'Leh (Steven Strait)--address each other kindly yet distantly, rubbing in the fact that he has yet to become what he was destined to be.    After slaying a mastodon in a long-winded huntingsequence, D'Leh is awarded with his tribe's special spear, a long stick topped with pointy animal bones. He feels unworthy, not only because the mastodon's death was more of a fluke, but also because of his past. His father abandoned the tribe years ago, leaving D'Leh feeling ashamed about his own existence. All that changes when a warring tribe attacks the village and kidnaps almost everyone, including Evolet; D'Leh and his surrogate father Tic'Tic (Cliff Curtis) are determined to save their people, even if it means traveling for weeks over steep mountains, through cold snows, through hot jungles, and across arid deserts. They face all four conditions on their journey, and that makes me wonder what region of the world this film takes place in, since (1) no such place exists in real life, and (2) they end up in Ancient Egypt. Never mind--I forgot that I'm not supposed to question this movie.    Evolet, meanwhile, is in the clutches of a tribe who make it its mission to gather slaves. A deep-voiced warlord (Affif Ben Badra) has taken a special liking to Evolet, especially since she has a rebellious streak (she's been dropping items on the ground for D'Leh to follow, like a trail of breadcrumbs). He tries to reassure her with calming words, no small task considering he speaks a foreign language she's not familiar with. By the time they reach Egypt, we begin to wonder whether or not we're supposed to hate him. It's quite possible he was meant to be somewhat of a sympathetic character, despite kidnapping Evolet and whipping her hands for being sneaky.    D'Leh and Tic'Tic eventually team up with a warrior tribe. This is for reasons other than a connection between the tribe and D'Leh's father; D'Leh is able to tame the heart of a saber-tooth tiger with no effort at all. Apparently, this tribe had prophesized the arrival of The One Who Speaks to the Spear-Tooth, and this is why they welcome him with open arms. D'Leh soon befriends Nakudu (Joel Virgil), the one member that conveniently speaks many languages; together, they convince a number of neighboring tribes to join forces. Thus the foundation is laid for the final major sequence, which sees D'Leh in Ancient Egypt fighting a group of slave-owners claiming to serve a living god.    I can describe the plot until I'm blue in the face, but to really understand how derivative and mindless this movie is, you will have to see it for yourself. \\"10,000 B.C.\\" is like a summer-popcorn version of Mel Gibson's \\"Apocalypto,\\" with everything even remotely complex and meaningful stripped away for the sake of action and special effects. But again, who cares? If the ads haven't made it clear by now, this was never meant to be a compelling human drama, even with Omar Sharif's continuous narration. It's an escapist movie and nothing more. It's meant to be entertaining, and to hell with pesky details like originality, character development, and substance. Yes, it would be easy to tear this film apart, but since it's not trying to be anything more than what it is, maybe we should just leave it alone. At the very least, we were spared a sequel to \\"Godzilla.\\" Surely something can be said for that.
B000002KGT|4.0|I used to think this was the greatest rock/pop album ever made.  However, as the years go by, and we learn about more musicians and bands out there, what we once considered some of the best music we've ever heard gradually falls by the wayside as our minds begin to realize this isn't the ONLY good pop rock worth listening to.  Rumours is a perfect example.      While not the best Fleetwood Mac album (I prefer the Peter Green period more because of his brilliant guitar playing) nobody can deny the songwriting is quite strong and melodic, and most of the songs will immediately sound familiar to those of you (fortunate) enough to not tune in to the radio every often.  For those of you who DO listen to the radio all the time, you're probably sick of most of these songs, and rightfully so.    So yeah, it's a good enough album filled with plenty of good, recognizable songs.  As for some other (better) pop bands of the 70's, check out bands like 10cc, Big Star, Be Bop Deluxe, Electric Light Orchestra, and Badfinger.  These artists are very talented and it's hard to believe they aren't more well-known among classic rock fans.  You can change that though, by giving them a chance.
B0015HS5TA|3.0|\\"Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day\\" is like a comedian trying so hard to be funny but only coming off as annoying. The two main characters have personalities that clash to an incredible degree: one is tightly wound and the other is always bright and bubbly. Together, they're about as incompatible as oil and water, and watching them is ultimately a tiring experience. This isn't to say that they don't have moments of effectiveness; they actually get more bearable as the film nears the end, at which point the theme of pretending to be something you're not is made clear. Based on Winifred Watson's novel and taking place in England at the dawn of World War II, \\"Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day\\" tells the story of how down-and-out governess Guenivere Pettigrew (Francis McDormand) inspires American actress Delysia Lefosse (Amy Adams) in the course of one day. Something about this idea doesn't sit well with me--maybe one day is not enough time for such big changes.    It would be too much to say that I disliked this film, but I definitely didn't appreciate the direction it wanted to go in. The story begins when Miss Pettigrew is once again fired; because it's happened so many times, her agency is unwilling to give her another chance. But as her boss berates her, one of Delysia business cards is left on her desk. Right away, a golden opportunity for arises for Miss Pettigrew to pose as an employed nanny. But as she quickly discovers, meeting Delysia is like walking through a sugary hurricane. Here's a young woman that's all fluff and frill, with a bouncy gait and a voice that would give Minnie Mouse a run for her money. Her girlishness is second only to her lust for fame; despite only getting work as a film extra, her ultimate goal is to be a singer/actress, first on London's West End, second in Hollywood.    Miss Pettigrew meets Delysia in her boyfriend's elegant flat. Dressed only in a robe, Delysia is in a panic because it's after ten in the morning and Phil has to get up. Miss Pettigrew is more than willing to help, believing that Phil is Delysia's son; upon entering the bedroom and tossing back the covers, she finds a naked nineteen-year-old man instead of a child. As it turns out, Phil Goldman (Tom Payne) is the son of one of London's best-known stage producers, and Delysia is sleeping with him because she wants desperately wants a part in a new musical play. Clearly, this is an entirely different situation for Miss Pettigrew, who's so old fashioned and bland that she feels completely out of place. Her feelings only intensify when she learns why Phil has to leave right now: Delysia's club-owner boyfriend, Nick, is on his way home. She also has to get ready to attend a fashion show (as an observant, not as a model).    By the time Miss Pettigrew meets Nick (Mark Strong), she realizes that Delysia stays with him for financial security, not because she's in love with him. In realizing this, Miss Pettigrew takes it upon herself to guide Delysia in matters of love, life, and happiness. Delysia is so grateful that she oversees a complete makeover of Miss Pettigrew, from her clothing to her hair to her makeup. It's through this that we meet Edythe Dubarry (Shirley Henderson), a fashion designer, and her ex-fiancé, Joe (Ciarán Hinds), also a fashion designer. Their relationship is on the rocks, which is understandable considering Edythe is snooty and scheming while Joe is honest and even-tempered. Things take an interesting turn when both women remember seeing each other the night before: Miss Pettigrew saw Edyth passionately kissing another man, and Edyth saw Miss Pettigrew waiting in the soup line near a homeless shelter. Each knows something about the other, and neither wants to be exposed. To show her authority, Edyth blackmails Miss Pettigrew, forcing her to convince Joe that the engagement should be called on again. She seems to be doing a good job with Delysia, anyway.    And speaking of Delysia, there's yet another man in her life.His name is Michael (Lee Pace), and he's and Delysia have an act of sorts at Nick's club--he plays the piano while she sings. Despite the fact that he doesn't have a penny to his name, he loves Delysia with all his heart. She loves him too, but she's also afraid of commitment since he can't give her the financial security she craves. He's understandably tired of her constant running around, and he immediately gives her an ultimatum: if she doesn't leave Nick and Phil, then he'll sail to New York and leave her forever. Miss Pettigrew can see that he's a wonderful man, but Delysia apparently doesn't know a good thing when she sees it; she's completely blindsided by the possibility of fame.    As the film nears the end, much of the grating comedy is replaced with more tolerable moments, largely defined by a deeper emphasis on character development. It isn't until the final twenty minutes that we learn of Delysia's past and Miss Pettigrew's former love life, and that's bad because both back-stories could have helped the story earlier on. Consider the fact that Miss Pettigrew and Joe show signs of having feelings for one another: had the audience known why she keeps her emotions under lock and key sooner, they wouldn't have seemed so ill fitting. Ultimately, \\"Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day\\" is a film that relies too much on character quirks and not enough on a substantive story. When you stop and think about it, does the title character really live for a day? Yes, she wears fancy clothes and attends parties, but she remains the same frazzled, nervous, emotionally distant woman all throughout. I don't consider that a way to live.
B00000IQW5|5.0|I didn't think of this movie as strictly a fantasy, or a romantic film.  The story was entirely possible to happen in reality, with a pilot unable to lift his airplane away from danger as a burning forest ignites the motor in the plane (and leads to the plane going down).  This movie had plenty of sad moments, and moments you were hoping the characters would find a way to escape the danger they were facing.  Sometimes they escaped, other times they didn't.    The story mainly focuses on one man who died in an airplane accident, and a few months after he dies, he has to come back as an angel and help his girlfriend and her new boyfriend (who also happened to take an interest in the same kind of airplane job involving planes flying over forests and putting out fires).      Many times the guy who died would whisper in the ears of the people he was trying to get a message across to, and every time he said something, his thoughts would be put into the heads of the people he was trying to communicate with.  This was very interesting and made you really wish he was able to talk face to face with the people instead of trying to get a message across through brain thoughts.    Overall, some very good emotional moments mixed with adventure and fantasy makes this a family movie well worth watching.
B000J103OI|4.0|When I first saw this movie in the theaters, I was disappointed, because they made it seem hilarious in the previews. The movie was not laugh out loud humor, but a clever and witty humor. Nothing that was gut busting laughter. I viewed it for a second time when I bought it and I love it! Now I know its true form of humor. Meryl Streep plays an excellent role   (as always!)as Miranda Priestley and Anne Hathaway also shines in her role as Miranda's new assistant trying to get used to her new physically demanding job. All in all it is a great movie in its humor, excellent acting and originality! This is a definite must see for movie lovers!
6304698798|5.0|This movie is the extended english version (over 3 hours) and it is one of my favorites. It is not you typical western, but is well done.
B000W4KT6E|5.0|I love this movie so much! It has great songs, great cast and a positive message! Anyone can achieve what they put their mind to. John Travolta plays an excellent role as Mrs. Turnblad and so does Nikki Blonsky as Tracy Turnblad! She is an overweight teen whose dream is dance on the Corny Collin's Show and won't stop to make integration the future . If you love musicials or love John Travolta or great comedy, give this movie a try! It a a definite must see for all movie lovers!

B000K7VHSM|5.0|I cannot tell you how much we have enjoyed this HD-DVD version of Brokeback. Of course we purchased the item because of the sad passing of Heath Ledger. However, we also enjoy the film for its incredible beauty.     The story is handled so artfully. The cinematic wide-screen images are beyond imagination. Annie Proulx is a wonderful author. We also purchased \\"Brokeback Mountain: Story to Screenplay,\\" which contains the original story and great essays by Proulx and the screenwriters.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|Ok...this album...SUCKS and thats putting it lightly. Long gone are the days of Hybrid Theory and the good mix of rap and rock. This was a waste of my money (which i ran out and bought the limited edition the day it came out). I mean...come on guys seriously who wants to listen to a bunch of whiney emo songs from yet another sellout band? I have lost all respect completely for this band and this album is to blame. Yes it does have evolution but its not a good one. I understand that they arent gonna put out another hybrid theory but could you atleast keep the awesome guitars and the hard rock beat to it? And wheres Mike on this one? It seems he is disapearing from the band which i dont like. All in all i recomend this album to no one who respects rock music its a waste of money
1400063515|2.0|Nassim Nicholas Taleb is, in equal parts, enthralling and utterly infuriating. He has written a book so sure of its own certitude, that has one effective lesson: there can be no certitude. Taleb makes the enormous mistake of believing (and saying) that he's solved the eternal verities - that after millennia of philosophical, ethical, political, economic and social debate: thrust and counter-thrust - that mathematics and physics can save the day.<br /><br />While there is certainly value in this book - if you can bear the cloying self-regard with which it is expounded, it's a pretty ripsnorting read - Taleb is also very, very inconsistent (or confused) about some very, very fundamental things which he doesn't seem to have read or thought nearly hard enough about. Early doors he praises the virtue of having unread volumes on the shelves of ones library: I was continually struck that it was a pity Taleb hadn't dipped into one or two of them along the way.<br /><br />Firstly, he calls himself a philosopher and an intellectual, but writes off people who \\"took too many philosophy classes\\" or \\"read too much Wittgenstein\\", and who may therefore be under the impression that language problems are important, when infact such intellectual niceties have \\"no serious implications\\".<br /><br />This, naturally, makes him look a bit of a Philistine, which would be okay, were it not to bear directly on the content of his book. The principle problem which Taleb sets out to solve is that of the misleading narrative discipline. Better familiarity with Wittgenstein might have helped him here. The Continental view is that we *cannot* make sense of with the world but through one or more narratives. Our daily labour is to untangle and jury rig all our working narratives so they can steer us in a broadly satisfactory path through the data. \\"The Truth\\" doesn't exist independently of our relationship to the physical universe, but rather is a function of our narratives. Narratives can't get in the way of truths; narratives are containers in which truths are packed and brought to market. Taleb might not like Platonicity, but it is the human (Humean?) dilemma that we're stuck with it.<br /><br />This might seem a petty, arcane, weekend-ish sort of objection, but I don't think it is. In overlooking this, Taleb fails to recognise that beloved physics and mathematics, by which he would sweep aside the dismal gaussian-inflected social sciences, are simply narratives themselves, with no epistemic priority over the social sciences (the priority that he cites is - must be - a narrative!). Indeed, he calls himself an \\"sceptical empiricist\\", but conveniently overlooks that the social scientists tend to be far more enthusiastic collectors of empirical evidence than physicists (a point made eloquently by in a recent book by [[ASIN:0521644119 Nancy Cartwright]]).<br /><br />Taleb's narrative is a rather quaint (and I would say uninformed) form of essentialism: He is a thorough-going reductivist who says things like \\"one may have a million ways to explain things, but the true explanation is unique, whether or not it is in our grasp\\" and seems to take it as read that all true learning, reduces to and can be extrapolated from a few essential, internally consistent logical truths.<br /><br />Pragmatists like [[ASIN:0226458083 Thomas Kuhn]] and [[ASIN:0691020167 Richard Rorty]](doubtless volumes on his Eco-esque Anti-library: his reading in the philosophy of science seems to have stopped at [[ASIN:B000T499GS Karl Popper]]) had a radically different (and to my mind more compelling) view about essentialism, but would agree about the pitfalls of what he calls \\"Platonicity\\", but would mark them down as facts of life. Taleb, curiously, isn't entirely antagonistic to Platonicity, and is happy enough to fall into it when it suits him (reductivism/essentialism about science is hard core Platonicity, in this humble reviewer's opinion).<br /><br />Taleb is also a contradictory on thevalue of the narrative. For example, he rails at length about Platonocity - to mistake the map for the territory - by dint of which we privilege \\"crisp constructs\\" over \\"less elegant objects with messier and less tractable structures\\": this is the sort of data compression that encourages the observation of \\"fraudulent\\" gaussian distributions - yet uses the opposite argument when warning against overly-detailed empirical \\"knowledge\\": \\"listening to the news on the radio is far worse for you than reading a weekly magazine, because the longer interval allows the information to be filtered a bit\\". That is to say, I suppose, that sometimes allowing a little bit of narrative weeding helps the Platonic garden grow.<br /><br />Such inconsistencies make Taleb seem like a buffoon (but not quite so much as his own needlessly self-aggrandizing tone does!), and his repeated harping about the injustices of the Nobel prize process suggest a bruised ego somewhere on the way.<br /><br />The fundamental point is that it's in the very nature of *any* intellectual or scientific enquiry to impose some order and organisation - a narrative - on otherwise unstructured data - we have to, to separate the significant from the irrelevant. The dilemma of induction is precisely that, ahead of time, it is impossible to know what will be significant, so the exercise of making that call, QED without evidence, is inherently fraught. Taleb would benefit immensely from reading Thomas Kuhn's wonderful and classic book [[ASIN:0226458083 The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]. Without that insight, Taleb's much vaunted \\"sceptical empiricism\\" amounts to not much more than saying \\"expect to be surprised\\".<br /><br />It might, as he points out, seem rational to calculate the forecast proitability of a casino on the odds available through time at the tables, but that is to ignore the risk of something unexpected happening such as a bomb going off in the lobby. But the nature of unexpected things is that you can't anticipate them. That's what it means to be unexpected.<br /><br />That's ultimately the conclusion of this unnecessarily long book: \\"Stuff happens\\". The interesting material is mostly covered in existing books written by more talented and less egotistical authors (I would highly recommend Philip Ball's [[ASIN:0374530416 Critical Mass: How One Thing Leads to Another]]) and the implication of the power law on the behaviour of markets is the subject of Benoit Mandelbrot's very good [[ASIN:B0010NYHGE The (Mis) Behaviour of Markets: A Fractal View of Risk, Ruin And Reward]].<br /><br />The Black Swan certainly rollocks along, but its author isn't talented, rigorous or informed enough to rate this book as a serious entry.<br /><br />Olly Buxtongth about Platonocity - to mistake the map for the territory - by dint of which we privilege \\"crisp constructs\\" over \\"less elegant objects with messier and less tractable structures\\": this is the sort of data compression that encourages the observation of \\"fraudulent\\" gaussian distributions - yet uses the opposite argument when warning against overly-detailed empirical \\"knowledge\\": \\"listening to the news on the radio is far worse for you than reading a weekly magazine, because the longer interval allows the information to be filtered a bit\\".

B0000029DD|5.0|If you have heard Buckley's definitive version of Hallelujah (apologies to John Cale) and want to buy the cd based solely on that, there is not a thing wrong with that.  But be aware that Buckley had very eclectic musical taste and all tracks will not (at first anyway) be for everyone.    That taste went across all types of genres and tempos and his first and only studio album had a loud alt-rock counterpoint that showed off the power of his amazing voice.  He was much more than just a sweet voiced crooner with an uncanny ability to unearth little known classic songs.  He could have been a great songwriter in his own right, given more time.    But never fear, if you like to keep things a little mellow, but still with a little edge, then buy this cd and program these tracks into your player-    -Lilac Wine  -Hallelujah  -Lover, You Should've Come Over  -Corpus Christi Carol  -And if you're feeling really adventurous- Last Goodbye.    There is more than enough in those five tracks to appreciate his incredible talent.      If you're musical tastes are a bit more eclectic and you can equally enjoy Nirvana, Pavement, Nina Simone, Richard Thompson, Neil Young, Cat Power and the Beasties, then go for it and listen to the whole thing. It's well worth it.
0316001821|1.0|I found the writing in this book to be rather trite and cursory.  The story was quite fluffy and the ending very Hollywood.  I really don't get all the hype around it; it was the hype that led me to it, and I was sorely disappointed.
B000069AUI|3.0|A Rush of Blood to the Head by Coldplay isn't a perfect album but they are some beautiful tracks like The Scientist, In My Place, Warning Sign, Clocks, and God Put a Smile Upon Your Face. The rest of the songs are kinda boring. Frontman Chris Martin's vocals can get annoying after awhile but the music this band creates is quite stunning, the piano and the guitars on Clocks still gives me chills!

Brilliantly acted and filmed. Love the music. We TIVO it every Sunday night ... but typically can't wait and watch it live. It's been a very long time since a TV show has been that good for us. Genius, Genius, Genius. I don't know what to say without burning my hands up with typing .... you've GOT to watch it. We (my wife and I) always feel more and more anxious about next week's show when this week's ends. Hungry for more.
0143038419|3.0|I picked up this book based on a friend's recommendation. I read the first chapter, which prompted me to buy the book, due to its comical and sarcastic tone. I could identify with her in a lots of respects, but as the book progressed I became exceedingly more annoyed with her general attitute that expressed nothing more than, \\"Poor me. I have to live in an ashram in India for another three months. Boohoo. Poor me. My marriage is falling apart and I have all this money to travel the world, but I'm dissapointed in everything... Waaaaaaa\\". Mindless and constant complaining. I got tired of hearing her complain about everything midway through India... I felt like I wanted to tell her to get over herself.    However, the reason I give it 3 stars is because it was entertaining and humorously written, and I did like it at first. Perhaps if I made it past India it would've redeemed itself, but I had to put the book down halfway through (a rare occurance for me).
B00007LTIB|4.0|Once maligned by fans and press alike for its uncompromising, complex soundpicture, this 1974 release has been given a fairer hearing by subsequent generations of fans. And quite right too. I suspect that many people (myself included, I'm ashamed to say) who originally slated the album as self-indulgent muso twaddle never really gave it a proper listen. Perhaps if we'd known what the crisp digital remaster was going to sound like, we'd been doing the Mexican wave instead of giving the thumbs-down.<br />Having said that, Relayer is definitely a departure from the tried-and-tested Yes formula of sunny, pastoral rock on which the band built up a huge fan base and record sales to match. After Close to the Edge, the group made a conscious decision to forego accessibility in favour of experimentation. Whereas Close to the Edge had been generally sunny and harmonious affair, Relayer is more chaotic and unhinged. And darker.  And this is the key to appreciating Relayer - these songs take you to a darker place than previous Yes albums. The jazzier overtones makes this the most urban-sounding of Yes records (Sound Chaser wouldn't be out of place in a Dirty Harry soundtrack). Patrick Moraz makes as valuable a contribution to the Yes line-up. His tasteful arrangements allow space for Chris Squire, Steve Howe and Alan White to stretch out musically, and you can sense that the guys are having the time of their lives.<br />As a result this is possibly the most spontaneous sounding Yes album to date, but also takes the longest to get into.
B000Y7ZHCU|1.0|I saw the show and thought it was very good even for people like me who are not big Celine Dion fan because it wasn't just a concert, it was a stage show where she provided the music. Unfortunatly, the DVD is disappointing and I feel ripped off because most of the show is cut out to make it just a concert DVD i.e. it went from a complicated show that had a flow to it to just a bunch of songs one after the other, like any other concert DVD.<br /><br />Also, the camera never sits still for more than a second. I nearly got sea-sick watching it. It is rapid fire: here's a closeup of Celine...here what it looks like flying over the stage...here are some people in the audience...here is a shot of the show...here what the show looks like from the worst seat in the house..now we are flying backwards over the audiance...here is the back of Celines head...here are more people in the audiance... and on and on.<br /><br />They also seemed to have cut parts of the show out. I know some songs are missing. Also, there were periods where the show continued while she changed and rested that are cut out as well.
B00130UFY2|1.0|This has to be the worst rendition of a rental service.  Downloading this movie via TiVo and amazon.com Unbox makes me feel this is the worst idea ever.  I was rejoicing in the idea, but on a 60\\" Sony screen delivering 720p, this movie should have made me feel like I was there.  This made me feel like I had wasted the $4.00 and will be unsubscribing from the service immediately.  The \\"widescreen format\\" turned out to be only 1/4 of the screen size, and *any* motion within the movie caused ghosting, creating a big headache for watching.  I'm sure this is at least a good movie in content, but in the end, it's in the quality of the end product.
B000Z27HLS|5.0|The family enjoyed all of the recent PBS Masterpiece Theatre Jane Austins, but this is my wife's favorite.
B000SOQDNQ|4.0|Okay, so that was a cheesy title. But the book was not chessy! I was intrigued by the premise - four very different people meet on the roof of a London highrise on New Years Eve. They are all there for the same reason: to commit suicide. All four characters have different reasons for wanting to off themselves. Some situations are certainly more dire than others, but none are treated as insignificant. In spite of the humor and wit, Hornby does actually manage to illustrate the point that when pain is your own, it seems insurmountable...and then as the book goes along, it drives home that nothing is worth jumping to your messy death. I laughed out loud a few times, even when I wanted to smack a couple of the characters. And Maureen, bless her heart! That's all I've got to say about her.     A perfect book? Of course not. So few are. But a very good one, especially if you enjoy Honrby's sense of humor.
B0000CABBW|5.0|This is a story about the Maori tribe's struggles to carry on their traditions as they have for the past thousand years.  However, when the first born son dies during birth and his twin sister, Pai, survives, it creates much tension in the tribe since females are not allowed to be chief under any circumstances.  She is constantly shunned as an outcast by her grandfather and most of the tribe.  Her grandfather attempts to train their indigenous ways to the other boys while Pai secretly watches from afar.  With minimal help from her uncle and from watching the other boys, she learns all of the traditions and performs better than any of the boys trained by her grandfather.  With the final test, retrieving the whale tooth, the boys each came up empty handed.  While out on the ocean later with her uncle she asks about the tooth and then immediately dives deep to the bottom and finds it much to the dismay of the others.  Her grandmother keeps it from her grandfather knowing it would hurt him further and he would never accept it.  After her performance one evening, they find the beach covered in whales refusing to return to the sea.  Their efforts are useless and Pai, watching from afar, knows why.  As the rest of her people begin to leave, she confronts the largest whale and magically returns it, as well as all the others, to the ocean while riding on its back.  It is at this point her grandfather finally accepts her special powers and abilities to lead their tribe.    Additionally, this movie reflects many aspects of indigenous people and their religions.  The tribe is a very close knit community, typical of many indigenous ways.  Pai's beautiful chanting in the Maori language is magical itself along with her emotional storytelling of her family's past.  While Pai's grandfather is unable to get the spirits to listen to him and guide him, they do listen to Pai and help guide her through this journey.  Pai acts as a shaman with her abilities to return the whales to the ocean.  Other examples are the grandfather teaching the other boys a sacred dance and how to fight with the sticks like a warrior, and his token of a whale.  The many references to the whales guiding the family are made even with them preventing Pai from moving to Germany with her father.  The clash between the tribe's indigenous ways and modern influences are also apparent especially with Pai's father moving away to pursue his artistic talents, thus, leaving his parents to raise her.
B000002UB3|5.0|As the band was breaking up and each member was getting into his own music this final recording is a fine legacy and wonderfull gift to their fans.<br /><br />Strong contributions from all, don't let anyone tell you Ringo was not a very good rock drummer. He adds significantly to the Beatles sound. George's \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" and \\"Something\\" saw him come of age as a song writer, Frank Sinatra called the later song the greatest Love song ever written, I wont argue with Frank.<br /><br />This, their last recording was recorded after Let it Be but released before,all the Beatles went on to successful solo careers, however never individually captured the quality of Abbey Road. Truely earning the Classic label.
B000YXMMAO|1.0|This rating and review refers only to the vinyl version of \\"In Rainbows\\" and is not a reflection of the actual music or the CD and MP3 versions that I also own and are superior to this offering. I was glad to see Amazon set up a vinyl record shop since there has not been a music store in my town that sold new vinyl releases in years. I thought \\"In Rainbows\\" by the \\"worlds greatest band\\" would be a good first purchase. What a disappointment. I own over a thousand lps and this is the worst pressing I have ever heard. It is completely dead. Maybe I just got a bad copy. It happens. I would hope Radiohead is as concerned with the quality of the format as they are the music that is on it especially now that they are not chained to a giant corporate record company. When I opened the record I was impressed with its heavy weight. Upon closer inspection I noticed what appeared to be a grainy texture in certain sections. I thought this may have just been residue left over from the pressing and that a good cleaning would help but to no avail. Upon further inspection I noticed what were distinct depressions running across the record's grooves on side 2. Still, I decided to play it and see how it sounded. The first thing I noticed was how incredibly low the volume output was, far more than most records. I then cranked the volume to a normal reference level with horrible results. In the 20 plus years of owning the Denon DP-47f turntable, I have never heard the rumble or feedback that I was experiencing while playing this record. I thought my Denon DL-110 cartridge was damaged the sound was so bad. No problem as I have a Sonographe SG-3 turntable with a Grado Blue cartridge set up on a separate system. No rumble this time but the SPL meter registered 20-22 dBls below the CD version. Additionally there was a noticeable lack in high and low frequencies, detail, and imaging when compared to the CD at the same listening level. Many audiophiles love to claim vinyl's sound is superior toCD, with good justification. Unfortunately with this record, that is clearly not the case. I thought of returning it. But, looking at previous Radiohead vinyl releases, in a few years I'll more than make up for it on the used market. In the meantime, I can always share with friends what a terribly pressed record sounds like. Get this record if you are a Radiohead collector; avoid it at all costs if you are a serious vinyl lover.
159562015X|5.0|I wish that this book had been written years ago.  It is an excellent read.<br /><br />Knowing myself has always been a challenge.  Having read through Strengths Finder 2.0, a well-written quick read, and having completed the supplemental online survey, I have a better understanding of myself.  This material, garnered from years of research with the Gallup organization is thorough, understandable, and accurate.  The results of the online survey were astounding and have helped me in developing my strengths.<br /><br />-- Bryan Entzminger
B0000009RX|5.0|Before  there were The Residents, Negativland, and Ice-T, there was Frank Zappa and his Mothers, offering us biting cynicism in music and bending the musical ear in acid-induced spirals!<br /><br />This album spells out Zappa's opinion of the late 60's \\"Flower Power\\" movement.  My brother turned me on to it when I was just a kid.  He said it was as if a Mad magazine was made into a record, and he was right!  Much as The Residents did with their \\"Third Reich and Roll\\" album, Zappa reinterprets that era's pop music with his own original biting and totally weird sonic adventures!<br /><br />The core message of Zappa?  \\"Plastic People...oh baby, now you're such a drag!\\"<br /><br />The core message of \\"We're Only In It For The Money?\\" \\"Snork-Snork!\\"
B000F3A7LE|5.0|The art of a novel was initially released in June 1979, as Robert Fripp presented 15 brilliant chapters between the Preface and Postscript.<br /><br />Through the ripping, punk-inspired, You Burn Me Up I'm A Cigarette, a special elegance in Mary, the enchantment in Here Comes the Flood and the Beat Generation colliding with new-wave in the title cut, this is a landmark release that retains a freshness and urgency some 30 years later.<br /><br />The 2-disc set contains the original album release and 22 bonus cuts, with a booklet which has excerpts from Fripp's personal notes during the remastering process. Exposure is a portrait in sound where every listener will find a biographical sketch in the mix.
B0012QE4OO|3.0|[[ASIN:B0012QE4OO Jumper [Theatrical Release]]]<br /><br />\\"Jumper\\" is a good movie that will appeal to science fiction lovers, comic book junkies and anybody who's ever wanted to travel the world without blowing their bank account.  The story is simple, the special effects and international sets are amazing, and the acting is ... well you can't have anything.  The young actors here are given very few lines to work with and might not meet the high standards of those who want every movie, including an action fantasy movie, to have award worthy acting.<br /><br />Many people will have to wonder what I wondered when I first read the reviews here: did I see the same movie as everybody else?  Why has this movie been panned by so many people?<br /><br />Fans of the original novel tend to be against this movie because it deviates from the original story and offers a much more film-friendly short version. [[ASIN:0765357690 Jumper: A Novel (Jumper)]]  There was a \\"prequel\\" story written to transition fans to this story, and you can check out those reviews to see their reactions. [[ASIN:1932664939 Jumper: Jumpscars - The Official Prequel to the Film (Jumper)]]<br /><br />I appreciate great acting, but I didn't expect Indiana Jones to win for best actor.  I likewise didn't expect too much from this acting-wise. Hayden Christensen may not the most expressive actor, but the kid is young!  Be realistic!  Actually, Bilson's portrayal as Millie was much less impressive, an overly flirty one-dimensional take.  And Samuel L. Jackson was almost getting paid twice for the role he played in \\"Unbreakable,\\" except here his character has the weapons and the strength to really fight the heroes.<br /><br />Many people also seem to want more back-story and explainations for the science behind his ability to teleport.  Yet don't the backstories in most movies like this make them even less believable?  How often in life do people stop in the middle of something to explain how and why everything is happening?  I was glad that they didn't waste time trying to explain a work of imagination.  This is a science fiction concept, nothing more.<br /><br />This movie, when viewed as just a movie, is great entertainment and very fun to watch.  Coming into this just as a movie-goer with no preconceived notions, I loved it.  I could suspend disbelief because I know how to let my imagination go when it comes to science fiction.<br /><br />Essentially, Hayden Christensen plays a young kid who is bullied at school and harassed by an alcoholic father.  He discovers his ability to teleport, and soon is making a new life for himself teleporting all over the world.  He soon discovers he's not the only \\"Jumper\\" out there, and that a group of paladins are determined to find and kill jumpers.  He returns to his hometown to find his high school crush, and has to deal with telling her his secret ability.<br /><br />The pacing was really well done.  This movie moves along very quickly.  It may leave a lot of unanswered questions but it also never leaves you dragging.  The score is well done, but there could have been more songs to create a real soundtrack.  They make up for it by moving from location to location with amazing cinematography.<br /><br />And let me tell you, the sets are amazing!  The camera work on top of Big Ben, at the Sphinx, on the Pyramids, and on and on, it was all amazing.  For those wide shots alone it's worth seeing in the theatres.  I was so jealous this guy could go wherever he wanted, from Europe to Africa to Asia.  I can't wait for the DVD to find out which locations were shot on set and which were created via CGI or some other means.<br /><br />Other special effects are impressive as well, as we see the \\"residue\\" of the jumper's as they teleport.  The paladins also have their own tools which are perhaps not as cool. There's also an amazing couple of fight scenes that are peppered in.<br /><br />The movie does end very quickly, and is clearly based ona plot designed for sequels.  That leaves the story with a lot of loose ends.  Still, I for one would gladly subject myself to a sequel, even look forward to one.<br /><br />If you want realism, going to see a fantasy thriller isn't going to give it to you.  If you want fun and love science fiction or comics, this movie is fun to watch.<br /><br />Enjoy!, I for one would gladly subject myself to a sequel, even look forward to one.      If you want realism, going to see a fantasy thriller isn't going to give it to you.  If you want fun and love science fiction or comics, this movie is fun to watch.    Enjoy!

B0012QE4QC|4.0|[[ASIN:B0012QE4QC The Other Boleyn Girl]] is bound to give historian's mixed feelings, and has elicited a wide range of reactions from audiences.  It benefit's from and adds to the interest surrounding King Henry VIII's royal court.  Showtime's [[ASIN:B000P12LWY Tudors]] miniseries has heightened interest in all things related to English royal history.<br /><br />Yet the writers have taken enough artistic liberties to raise questions regarding the accuracy of these accounts.  This story is based on the historical fiction novel [[ASIN:1416560602 The Other Boleyn Girl]] by Philippa Gregory.  Despite the artistic liberties taken with the story it  is very well put together and interesting to watch for those willing to broaden their historical views on the period.<br /><br />The Story and the Acting<br /><br />The story of King Henry VIII's many romantic exploits are well known.  He married Catherine of Aragon for political gain, yet engaged in many well publicized affairs. Eventually, each of the Boleyn sisters landed in his crosshairs.<br /><br />Eric Bana is very good as the king, though his isn't the best written role in the film. Anne Boleyn's character is dynamic and vindictive, and Natalie Portman shows her range here.  Her sister Mary, played by Scarlett Johansson, catches the King's attention.  Though she is newly married, her husband is disposed of and the King has soon added her to his list of conquests.<br /><br />But Anna will not be outdone.  She coyly preys upon the King's desires, and soon becomes the object of his affections.<br /><br />All three of these actors put in strong performances.  Johansson's role is understated and Bana's is exaggerated.  Only Portman has a character with full range, both manipulative and vulnerable.<br /><br />Jim Sturgess, whose star seems to be rising, has a somewhat understated role as the brother, George Boleyn.  His role is ultimately manipulated by the powers that by to undermine Anne when her perceived value falls.  He is perhaps the most under-utilized actor here, with few lines and a role not in keeping with the importance he played in history.  Yet with his lead role in [[ASIN:B0018CWW5K 21]] to add to this one, he is clearly not hurting for work.<br /><br />Yet the sets and the costumes are also characters here, as in any period piece.  The castle is made shadowy with expert lighting.  The costumes and the makeup are also beautifully done, though I can't comment on just how historically accurate they are.  Yes, we can expect Academy Award nominations in many categories, including costumes, set design, art direction and cinematography.<br /><br />The DVD Extras<br /><br />While the DVD version of this includes the standard commentary track to accompany the film, it is the other extras that really add dimensions to the story.  There are bios and back-stories of principal characters which were close in production value and content to something one might watch on The History Channel.  Including the standard author, cast and crew sound-bites, there were also interviews of historians to put the story in context.<br /><br />Warnings and Considerations<br /><br />At the close of the picture, after the inevitable historical event which everyone familiar with the story will be expecting, there is a somewhat strange montage of all the characters which includes brief captions explaining their fates and the historical significance of the events they took part in.  The notes are hard to read, somewhat prosaic and are definitely subjective.  Yet they do seem to convey a message which I conclude was intentional: that the somewhat petty sexual and interpersonal exploits of this group of people had tremendous historical consequences for the UK, Europe and the world.  This is very subjective, yet it partly justifies what is otherwise a very convenient and abrupt technique to end the movie and tie up all the story lines neatly.<br /><br />This is definitely a version that is not for kids.  Thestory deviates in sometimes shocking ways, with the sex turning violent in at least one scene.<br /><br />Some of the actors do suffer from a loss of their accents in some scenes, yet the in-the-moment performances make that easy to ignore.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />If you're a fan of period pieces and all things English royalty, this movie is already on your list.  It's worth the price of admission.<br /><br />Enjoy!ne.     Some of the actors do suffer from a loss of their accents in some scenes, yet the in-the-moment performances make that easy to ignore.

B000WTNCYA|5.0|What a fantastic talent! I just heard an interview on Ms. Gardot on NPR and immediately ordered the cd!    Her voice feels like a wonderful cross between Eva Cassidy and Norah Jones and her story is so interesting. I'm sorry about her physical disabilities but the gift she is now giving back because of those disabilities is a joy to all! Thank you Melody Gardot for your fabulous talent...
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|I actually went to our local indie film house for this and loved it. Of course, my husband is British and we love all the British farce we can get our hands on. Classic slapstick, it will keep you laughing right up until the end. If you liked \\"Muriel's Wedding\\", \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\" or even \\"Very Bad Things\\" (American) you'll like this. It is a bit on the dark side of funny...ok, it's a LOT on the dark side of funny but it's so worth the watch. Peter Dinklage was an absoulute scream. Literally.
6305537321|4.0|Overall, this is a well-done movie, with the exception of Mickey Rooney.    My problem is not in the adaptation of the Truman Capote novella--it IS a very different story than what's being told here.  Could you film a version that's closer to Capote's story?  Of course.  But this film works as a stand-alone piece.      My problem is:  how old exactly is Holly supposed to be?  Audrey Hepburn was 31 when she made this movie, and while she's absolutely enchanting in it, SHE LOOKS 31.  But when Buddy Ebsen shows up, he tells George Peppard that Holly was just shy of 14 when they married, and that his first wife died on the 4th of July, 1955.  Since the movie is set in 1961, that would make Holly (at most) all of 20 years old.
B0010ZR160|3.0|The movie begins with a sappy voice over from the male lead ( Ben Affleck's little brother Casey ), Describing the toughness of the people from his Boston neighborhood, with the same drippy sentiment that Tim Daily describes the life of islanders off the coast of Maine, in The Stephen King mini-series \\" The Storm of the Century\\". As the camera eventually settles in on the gathering of neighbors, cops, and press, we discover the root of the story, a four year old girl has been abducted. Out of the infinite number of possible directions this film could of gone on from here, the twisted path it eventually chose is not one I would of imagined or concidered. The first monkey wrench tossed into the gears is the introduction to the lead character and his live in girl friend, Private detective Patrick Kenzie ( Affleck ), and Angie Gennaro ( Michelle Monaghan ). For starters, Casey Affleck looks like William Peterson, and John Pankow from \\"To Live and Die in L.A.\\" had a baby. Added to this, his voice sounds like he has a rather stuffy head cold. He does not strike me as leading male material. Then there is the way that his character is drawn out. He is so cock sure of himself, that he can verbally threaten and insult a Haitian drug lord in the drug lord's own home, and stair down the agitated Haitians locked and loaded 9MM without so much as blinking. I have heard that Boston folk can be a tough sort, but the unflinching way in which he handles these life and death situations, and the actual life and death situations themselves stuck as far too macho to be real.    I can and will acknowledge that there is some rather fun and thrilling moments to be had in this film. For starters I thought that The Academy of Motion Pictures Sciences were dead right in nominating Amy Ryan for an Oscar for bad parent Helena McCready, but not letting her win. She had some rather racey dialog and solid scenes, and did outshine her costars in this film with her treatment of her collorful material, but I did not think it warrented actually winning the trophy. I also found the shootout between the hero and the elder crack head couple The Trett's and their live in pedophile friend Corwin Earle ( Matthew Maher ), to be pretty nail biting. Unfortunately, it is when this film passes this point that my interest gets put to an endurance test. It is as if someone took two seperate films and tried to stick them together in the middle, and quite frankly, I had plenty of problem with the premise of this film, which is what the second half is all about.    \\" You need a licence to drive a car, you need a licence to catch a fish, but the will let any *bleeping bleepidy bleep* be a parent.\\"    Sorry to have to let the cat out of the bag and spoil the ending, but the whole premise of this film is faulty at best. We are suppose to buy the notion that just because someone is a lousy parent who neglects a really cute child, that it would inspire an uncle, and a group of high level police officers to cook up some elaborite scheme to abduct the child themselves. All so it could be raised by a member of their group who once lost a child, and thus would not take this poorly mothered cutey for granted. To make this scheme even more hair brained, they would attept to hide their envolvement in her abduction by trying to fake the childs death. In order to do so they would also get into a staged gun battle with The Haitian drug lord at night and in the woods, so that the staged witnesses would only sort of see what transpired. More preposterous still, is that they now have to have transcripts and other documents forged, a self firing of the lead abductor and new parent set up, and even go so far as to have a staged armed robbery. When you add in the fact that the press is all over this case, it makes the entire premise to the story completely asinine. Now, the obvious question is, what is Capt. Doyle ( Morgan Freeman ) going to do with this child? He can't enroll her in school. Hell, he can't even take her outside in public because of the off chance that the child would be recognized. So again I ask, What is Morgan Freeman going to do with this abducted child? I can only guess that he has to keep her locked in the basement of his house like the proud parent of a circus freak.     Near the end of the film, we have the big show down speech between Casey Affleck and Morgan Freeman, but whatever meaning that was suppose to be involved in this wrap up is now completely lost on me, mainly because my mind is too logical to buy any of it. The film ends with cute little Amanda's mommy once again doing what a good crack-ho does and leaving her tyke for Casey Affleck to watch. He of course looks at little Amanda with the same longing and sadness that Morgan Freeman did signifying that not only does he now understand Morgan's inner pain, but he himself could be capable of abducting this child, just to give it a better life.    Being that I am the age I am, and have become realistically dissipated by people and life events, I.E. Jaded, I found myself wanting to shout out at how blatantly stupid I found these child lovers to be. In what way would it possibly help this child to be abducted and kept in hiding for years until her appearance changed and the public forgot? That hardly seems like a vast improvement on her current life situation, and if caught, the consequences for the abductors seem hardly worth the risk. Secondly, sure little Amanda is cute now, but just wait a few years. She is probably destined to become a skank herself, with or without the abduction. Ultimately this is a film you should rent first to see if you like it enough to own, because if you are at all like me, you will be turning your copy in for trade or dropping it off at your local library.
B000001EL7|2.0|I remember when this came out. I was learning to play drums and Rock and Roll Over was the last studio album KISS came out with. That album rocked!<br />I could jam on it! Love Gun was filled with so much mediocre non-rocking filler, I could not play through it. Listening to Love Gun today it still feels like a product delivery deadline and a cash in from the band. They were not hungry and probably burned out. Only for Kiss Kollectors.
B000RJO57I|4.0|British comedies remain an ilk of their own - smart, sassy, full of quips rendered so quickly that many are lost in the ether that propels the plot, and characters who often are such finely-honed parodies that they make us laugh at ourselves.  HOT FUZZ is a fine example and it is a film brimming with a cast of some of England's finest talent who seem to be having as much fun as the viewing audience.<br /><br />Sgt. Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is one of London's finest new policemen, expecting a smart career in the big city, but instead is transferred by jealous superiors (including Bill Nighy) to a little village where his rigorous training seems wasted on the sleepy town.  After a first night's arrest of youthful pubsters and an inebriate driver, he reports to duty to discover the that his first 'arrest' is to be his partner PC Danny Butterman (Nick Frost) who just happens to be the slow son of the chief, Inspector Butterman (Jim Broadbent). The staff at the police station resembles a vaudeville team played by such fine actors as Paddy Considine, Rafe Spall, Timothy Dalton etc, not exactly what Angel had in mind as a career advancing  opportunity.  But soon enough the threads of evil that are beneath the silly facade of the village begin to unravel and what follows is a hilarious, almost Keystone Cop attack on the loonies in this take off of an Agatha Christie plot that curdled.<br /><br />And that only touches the surface of this witty little farce: the innuendoes pop up out of every situation, giving the astute viewer quiet chuckles throughout the film.  Hidden from obvious view are little vignettes by such luminaries as Cate Blanchett, Steve Coogan, and Peter Jackson! Director Edgar Wright, who wrote the script with Simon Pegg, knows his way around the genre and the result is an hysterically funny evening's entertainment.  Grady Harp, March 08
1594489505|4.0|I had read several reviews on this site complaining that this book was somewhat trite and not as good as \\"The Kite Runner\\", so I was a bit biased against it when I picked it up. However, it's a lot better than I expected, and I really enjoyed it.    There's a genre of books involving abused women escaping brutal, piggish husbands that I've gotten bored with, for example, Amy Tan's novels like \\"The Kitchen God's Wife\\" and \\"The Joy Luck Club\\". After a while they start sounding repetitive. I'm not arguing with anybody that domestic abuse is a real and serious problem - my high school friend's father used to beat up her and her mother - but there's only so much mileage you can get out of it on the literary front. People don't primarily read novels to \\"educate\\" or \\"enlighten\\" themselves, but for entertainment; education is secondary.    However, Hosseini's writing is good enough that it's not JUST the same old story of saintly victim/devilish husband. The descriptions of Maryam and Laila's respective childhoods and the development of their relationship with one another are interesting enough to add some \\"meat\\" to the book. The one thing I think the Maryam/Laila interaction is missing is the total absence of humour. Not that they had a life that was funny at all, but in the sense of \\"black humor\\" or \\"gallows humor\\" that people in bad situations use as a way of commiserating.    Also, it's generally fun to read about everyday life in cultures other than the middle-class Southeast Asian I was born into or the middle-class white American I'm familiar with.    What really scared me was when Laila and her childhood friend Tariq were introduced. Given that most readers of this book have probably read \\"Kite Runner\\" I don't think it'll surprise anyone to say that I instantly assumed that something horrible was going to happen to Tariq. In spite of my assumption, it's nice that there was a happy ending, but in some ways Laila's rescuer was something of a deus ex machina too, although Hosseini justifies it.    Aside from this single plot hole, it's a good book overall and definitely worth reading.
0375846735|5.0|Philip Pullman's \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy may be suffering somewhat from the lackluster film adaptation of \\"The Golden Compass,\\" but there's no denying that Pullman's three books are among the best novels the fantasy genre has to offer.      With \\"The Amber Spyglass,\\" Pullman brings his series to a shattering conclusion as Lyra and Will fight in the war that has been building for thousands of years.  While angels, witches, specters, and creatures from various parallel worlds kill and die, Lyra and Will struggle for the most basic and critical of prizes - love and mastery of one's destiny.    There are too many plot twists and surprising developments for me to attempt to summarize the story in any greater detail.  Suffice it to say that some villains are redeemed, some heroes lose their way, and that Pullman never panders to his readers.  This is not one of those books that builds to a cliched ending that has everyone standing happily together at the end, a la the medal ceremony from \\"Star Wars Episode 4:  A New Hope,\\" where everyone gets cheered after the Death Star blows up.  This is a more complex, subtle tale, and don't be surprised if you shed a few tears as Lyra and Will complete their journeys.     This is a wonderful series that any parent can feel good about giving to their child - or reading themselves.  This is intelligent, deep stuff.  Yes, yes, Pullman has had the audacity to write an allegory about religion, but his strong opinions shouldn't scare anyone who enjoys the free exchange of ideas - very few ideas are as well-expressed as this.  The only caution I would consider making is that these books can be a little scary, so you might want to think twice about letting younger kiddies get their hands on it.  But judge that for yourselves.    What a wonderful series.
B00003CXA2|5.0|One of the greatest films of all time... and definitely one of the two best Tom Hanks performances EVER!  The other, of course, is Philadelphia... with a close third for \\"Cast Away\\".  My opinion, of course.      I highly recommend this film for everyone.  Male, female; young, old; conservative or liberal.  Everyone will find something in this film to relate to and love.
B000002MZ6|5.0|There's an optimism to Mike Oldfield's music that is not for everybody. I can understand that some people would find it cloying. But I'm not one of them. I admire artists who are hopeful and melodic. The icing on the cake is the inclusion of Frank Borman's reading of Genesis from lunar orbit. This is a wonderful album, I never tire of hearing it.
B000ZOXDFA|2.0|i loved the first but i feel the second comes up a little short, great if you catch it on HBO, but i wouldn't buy it again.
B000ZOXDFA|3.0|I wanted to see this film when it was in the theatres, but it seemed it was gone in the blink of an eye. Having watched this long-awaited DVD, I can see why it had a short run.<br /><br />I loved the prequel, \\"Elizabeth\\", and had eagerly looked forward to this sequel. Upon viewing it, I was a tad disappointed.  It totally omits a pivotal character, Robert Dudley, the Earl of Leicester, the man who was Elizabeth's confidante and played a vital role in the events of the day. Instead, the screenplay chooses to focus on a supposed romance between Sir Walter Raleigh and Elizabeth, which plays itself out against the backdrop of a serious threat of war with Spain. Unfortunately, this supposed romance simply does not ring true, striking a false note, and therein lies the rub. The screenplay was poorly written, and the film came across as choppy and poorly edited. Consequently, unless one is familiar with the historical events of the day, the viewer might find the plot confusing. On the plus side, the costumes, the sets, and, above all, the acting were magnificent.<br /><br />Cate Blanchett, as always, is terrific as Elizabeth, although she looked like a woman in her thirties rather than one supposedly in her fifties, which has a somewhat jarring effect. Geoffrey Rush is once again excellent in the role of Sir Francis Walsingham, Elizabeth's spymaster. Clyde Owen makes for a very virile and dashing Sir Walter Raleigh, while Abbie Cornish is delightful as Elizabeth \\"Bess\\" Throckmorton, the Queen's lady-in-waiting and Raleigh's true love.<br /><br />While I love period films, I would recommend that one rent, rather than buy, this DVD.  Although I enjoyed the film, somewhat, I was torn between awarding it three or four stars. In the end, however, the crappy script overwhelmed the efforts of its stellar cast. I only hope that if there is to be another sequel that the script rises to the level of the talented cast. Unfortunately, here it does not.

The concert was very good, and the overall feel is excellent. If your a Doors fan I highly recommend it. If your a casual fan, I still recommend it, if you want to hear something different from a legendary band.

B00000JGHM|4.0|Fabulous Los Angeles based cops and robbers movie, full of action without the Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels nonsense that is all too pervasive these days.  Robert DeNiro plays bad guy Neil McCauley with brilliant subtlety.  Val Kilmer is a good shamefaced gambler in love with and doing it all for Ashley Judd.  But Al Pacino.  My god, the man is incapable of delivering a line without either inserting. a . pause . between . each. word or SUDDENLY HOLLERING WITH BULGING EYES AT INAPPROPRIATE TIMES.  He is clearly trying to trade on his 'dangerous man nearly unhinged' persona of Godfather days, but he is just embarrassing.  He can't play a love scene worth beans either - he is blank eyed, monotone and unlikeable (Scent of a Woman - dire).  Shame, because the movie is otherwise a corker.
0385338724|5.0|I love Sophie's books and this held up to my expectations. Great summer read! I recommended this book whole heartedly!
B000MV8AE0|3.0|I wanted to like this.  I mean, really like it.  You know, how we all loved Amadeus and even Immortal Beloved.  But this film, while it has its moments, just doesn't quite make it. Indeed, Copying Beethoven copies scenes straight out of both Amadeus and Immortal Beloved. And I probably will catch heck for this, but although Ed Harris is an accomplished and talented actor, I feel that he is miscast here.  Ok, maybe I'm biased towards Gary Oldman and I imagine that the director, Agnieszka Holland, probably considered casting Oldman and then second-guessed herself.  But Oldman really \\"got\\" Beethoven. I was just more aware of watching Ed Harris, the actor, than really tuning in to Beethoven, the man.   Diane Kruger, on the other hand, really steals the film.  She is perfectly beguiling and beautiful as the 23 year old Viennese music student, Anna Holz.  The film does have several beautiful moments of convergence such as when Beethoven begs forgiveness from Miss Holz because he has insulted her music, or when he is describing to her the \\"silence in between the notes\\", (who better to know this silence than the deaf Beethoven), and that this is our only true connection to God and thus, the inspiration for music (only his is the greatest music!). The scene with Beethoven, Anna and Anna's beau is both riveting and brilliant. I fear that a newcomer to classical music may not be as inspired as I was, given the film's overly-brooding tone, dark photography, and sense of trying just a bit too hard to impress. That being said, I would still recommend it.  Afterall, the score is still Ludwig Van.

B000VI70WM|5.0|Okay, from what I have read so far, either you love or hate this cd.  Personally, I think of this cd is a branch of a Duran Duran that was a very successful experiment.    They tried something new and sounded great doing it.  It may only be for one cd, but what they did was bold and daring.  They experimented with a sound that works for them.  An ex-boy-band member (who, by the way, was born after their career started) who produces the longest-surviving boy bands cd.  That's a chance they took and it was a great one!!    I haven't listened to a Duran Duran cd this much, in it's entirety, since Rio. I'm not saying that Duran Duran needs to keep this style of music going for the next 20 years, but it is so worth this cd.  They have great dance tracks (that are sounding very current, for the times), some great ballads...just simply, some great material that's great to listen to (especially, if you're into dance music).    THANK YOU Duran Duran, for ever-expanding your range and style of music.  You keep with the times, and still try to keep your own style.  Keep up the great work and I can't wait to see how many singles come off this release.    THANK YOU again,    Bill Karnes
0743270754|5.0|[[ASIN:B000OVLNII Team of Rivals]] is not a light, fluffy popcorn portrait of Abe Lincoln. It is serious, scholarly and comprehensive examination of his relations with the cabinet before, during and immediately following the U.S. Civil War. In 750 pages, noted historian Doris Kearns Goodwin does an admirable job covering Lincoln, William Seward (Sec. of State), Salmon Chase (Sec. of Treasury), Edwin Stanton (Sec. of War) and Edward Bates (Attorney General). Except for Stanton; who was a Democrat, each was a political rival of Lincoln's for the Republican nomination of 1860. Seward and Chase were both heavily favored over the one-term former congressman from Illinois. Bates was also a dark horse, but more experienced and better known. Somehow this uneducated prarie lawyer found a way to maximize his fantastic political skill to engineer a victory on the third ballot. This alone makes for a remarkable story.<br /><br />Kearns Goodwin begins [[ASIN:B000OVLNII Team of Rivals]] comparing the early lives of each rival. Seward from New York. Chase from Ohio. Bates from Missouri. And Lincoln moving from Kentucky to Illinois. She vividly paints the family tragedies, personal sorrows, failures and successes of each. It is my best part of the book and the historian is at her grandest in the first hundred or so pages. Once the narrative moves on to the Civil War, she treads on more familiar historical ground. Major battles on the field and with the Congress and press are highlighted only briefly and intermittently. All the big names of the age get their due. Lincoln and Seward were closest and their relationship gets more ink than any of the others.<br /><br />My sole criticism of Kearns Goodwin is that she presents the assasination of Lincoln and attempt on Seward as almost an afterthought, rather than a compelling beginning of the post-civil war era. It is almost as though her editor explained at the last minute that she could go no longer than 750 pages, and chopped out 30+ from the fascinating assasination plot. Aside from this, there is a master work of history in [[ASIN:B000OVLNII Team of Rivals]]. Readers will get a good sense of Lincoln's humor, fairness, passion and genius. Civil war history buffs may not like her skimpy treatment of the battles, guns and Generals--but that's not the story this author is choosing to tell. The rarely discussed, crucial bond between Lincoln and his oft-contentious team of rivals is what the talented historian is interested in. Each cabinet officer came to love and respect a personality that everyone counted out in 1860. The legend of Lincoln is well-deserved, we have had no greater president before or since.ating assasination plot.

1582701709|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I've applied it to several areas of my life and in less than a month I have never been happier or more excited about the control I have over my own life. I started small like they said, with just a parking spot and there it was the first day. After that I applied it to several other areas and in only days I recvd. an unexpected check in the mail for over $400, I no longer weight myself every morning because I finally love my body, and my husband has been happier than I've ever seen him. These are just a few of the many things that I have brought into my life with the power of the secret. My next goal is $100,000,000.00 I believe it's coming. I don't know how, but I'm confident it is. Just believe. If you have been drawn to this book like I was, there is a reason. You attract in your life what you most think about. Thoughts become things. BUY IT!
B00008RH3L|5.0|I watched this for the first time yesterday, and I have to say that I can't believe that I've gone all these years without watching it. I've always loved the Coen Bros. work, and this is no exception. I would rank it up on the list of some of the best gangster/noir flicks of all time. It is most definitely one of the best films of the '90s. The performances are all great, especially Albert Finney who is simply amazing in his role. The score by Carter Burwell is haunting, and one of the best.     I will be buying this DVD along with the soundtrack very soon. Recommended, especially for those who have not seen it yet. Please do not miss this one!
B0000TB01Y|1.0|Banal, mainstream fluff for the crowd that enjoys musical adaptations of Legally Blond and Disney movies.  A great concept completely ruined by music composed for the lowest common denominator.  Simply singing your dialogue does not make it a \\"song\\" -- and such lame, corny dialogue at that.  Utterly agonizing to sit through.  Somehow, it managed to knock Phantom off the top of my worst musicals list.  If there were a Musicals for Dummies book, this would be the first chapter.  Parents do themselves and their children an utter injustice by seeing this; what a way to warp one's conception of what musical theatre can and should be.
B00004RF8J|5.0|This excellently rendered film version of the quirky Broadway musical can be enjoyed even by people who are not usually fans of the genre.  Like the recent HAIRSPRAY the setting is the early 60's and the two films also share the rather unique fact that they are filmed versions of Broadway musicals that were inspired by non musical films. Rick Moranis is perfect as nerdy Seymour who finds fame and fortune when the the plant he cultivates - Audrey II - grows in to a media sensation but not without a few complications.  Ellen Greene is great as Seymour's blond love interest (the original Audrey) who is looking for a nice guy like Seymour but doesn't think she deserves one. Vincent Gardenia is the other lead playing Mr. Mushnik the owner of Skid Row Florists and Audrey and Seymour's boss.  Steve Martin creates  Audrey's sadistic dentist boyfriend unforgettably.  Smaller cameo roles are played by Christopher Guest, John Candy, Jim Belushi and most memorably Bill Murray.    I've never seen the original 1960's film but I understand it has a dark  ending similar to the stage version which I have seen.  Though this film  concludes in a lighthearted manner it is not without a suitably ominous final touch.
B000ZLFALS|5.0|This film is a stimulating and emotional provoking masterpiece. It fills the senses with the nostalgia of classic Beatles songs coupled with late 60's era picturesque scenes of the lives of young hearts in love and in conflict with the world and themselves.  The renditions of timeless songs like \\"I wanna hold your hand,\\"  \\"Let it be,\\" and \\"Dear Prudence\\" are both original and memorable.  Apart from a few brief interruptions of the flow of the film, this movie/musical sends wave after wave of poetic expression at the audience.  Making older Beatles fans misty eyed, and newer fans open to the genius that was and still is some of the best music ever written.
0618918248|1.0|Dawkins continues to appeal to reason and to logic. He frequently appeals to moral values when critiquing religion. The fact of the matter is, if he is to be honest about his position, then the notions of reason, logic and morals, not to mention natural laws must be considered to be purely human conventions. The universe is irrational, having come about by pure chance and nothing else. Our ideas of reason and logic, morality and our perception of \\"natural laws\\" are also, at the core, irrational themselves. They are a product of an irrational and chaotic universe. There is no way of knowing whether it is right to murder or not. Even if one would respond by saying, \\"it is wrong to murder because it harms the progress of the species\\". However, that is again an appeal to morals - for in the atheist point of view, who can say that it is actually better to exist than to not exist?    The atheist is being dishonest by appealing to logic and reason. He simultaneously says it is a convention of man impressed upon to the world to make the universe rational (rationalizing the irrational is by definition, absurdity) and acts and speaks as if Logic and Reason were existential principles which exist above and beyond the plain of the material world. Logic and Reason are both immaterial, but the world is assumed to operate according to these laws which contradict the very idea that the universe is irrational, having come about by pure chance with nothing guiding it at all.     The atheist is also making the mistake of assuming his observations are correct. He himself is part of the very system he is observing. He is attempting to rationalize the irrational by appealing to notions which he simultaneously denies are existential and immaterial and accepts as existential and immaterial. The atheist has no right to appeal to logic, reason, or to critique religion's actions through the ages based on morals. He speaks from within the system; himself an irrational being. How can he believethat his observations about an irrational universe are rational?    Dawkins hurls insults at God, or rather, the idea of God. He attributes evil intent, malice, bloodshed, and various other wrongs to God. He critiques the morals of Christians who have led Crusades in the Middle East. Granted, Christians have done horribly un-Christian things in the name of Christ; but Dawkins has no right to judge Christianity.     Why?    He denies morality as an absolute - even if he does not admit it. His position necessarily believes that morals are simply an idea impressed by man upon the irrational world around him. Man is an irrational being, morals are irrational, and have no metaphysical foundation which make them \\"real\\" or worth paying any attention to. They are the creation of an irrational creature. On what basis can he say that murder is wrong? It is simply the Western mindset that says life has sanctity (and not all life at that!). On what basis can he ascribe what he considers vile human characteristics to God when the content of his moral categories have nothing behind them. His morals are simply a human invention, forced upon the world. They are in actuality, absurd and meaningless.     Furthermore, why is he a virulent atheist? Why does he hate the notion of God so much? If God is an empty idea and morals have no real value (in fact, even the concept of value has no actual content), then why is it \\"good\\" to attempt to smash the idea of God? Because humanity will accomplish so much \\"good\\" and will \\"advance\\" if the idea of God is squashed? Besides the fact that Godless institutions (Communist Russia, for example) have failed miserably, on what basis can Dawkins make an appeal to progress or continued survival as being beneficial? It is pure absurdity - it is purely random and arbitrary. Dawkin's view leaves room for nothing but arbitrariness.     Dawkins cannot argue his position without appealing to the Christian idea that the world around us is ordered and understandable. He appeals to the Christian idea of logic - that man has a rational mind and can reason to understand a rational world created by a rational God. He appeals to the laws of nature and reason as if these were immaterial things. Simultaneously, he denies Christianity and the status of reason and logic as immaterial and existential. He denies all spirituality and hence has no where to turn for any of his bases of belief. All of his ideas are arbitrary and without foundation - simply the ideas forced upon a world in order to understand it. He denies God at the outset, and then uses the concept of absolutes to deny there are absolutes. His atheism presupposes theism because he cannot escape the theistic ideas of logic, reason, and natural laws being established, unchangeable, ordered, and operating in a predictable manner.
0792841344|4.0|Is this movie.    It's not often I give a horror movie 4 stars,but this one has a likability and freshness that makes it watchable.    Unlike other horror films(i.e. Jeepers Creepers)this one is genuinely not stupid or cliche.    For what it is,I have no major dislikes.
B000TGJ7ZY|2.0|I disliked this in 1992, when I didn't know anything about movies, and now that I work in the movie industry, and see it again, I see why I didn't like it; it stinks. Every great director has an embarrassment, this is Coppola's. Bad casting ( Keanu Reeves must be the most mis-cast actor in history ), bad screenplay. 20 minutes into the movie they start throwing gags at you, like rats running upside-down on the ceiling, and shadows that move independently - every 5 minutes, non-stop; no subtlety, no mystery.  Production value is good, which keeps it above 1 star, but still very weird, and weird in a way that does not work, lots of clashing, gawdy designs.

B000TX7B5U|5.0|I have listened to this album about 200 times and I still love it.  In my opinion just as good as SOAD.  The bonus is that Serj sings all the songs, unlike the last few SOAD albums where he gets about half.

0321544080|5.0|I recently finished the book \\"The moment it clicks\\". I'm writing to recommend it unreservedly. The format is two page spreads: one side is text including a \\"how to make this shot\\" column, and the other side is a (usually) full page image demonstrating what's being talked about. Much of the advice is about controlling lighting when you can, and dealing with it when you can't. Even though I don't have multiple radio controlled strobes I learned some useful stuff. There's a section in the back which is just stories about being a photographer, and a couple of pages showing all of the author's gear.    One very enjoyable piece of advice from the book: \\"to be a better photographer, stand in front of more interesting things!\\"  I need to take that advice!
B000002ADT|5.0|I'd been playing jazz piano for eight months before I \\"discovered\\" this album. It came into my collection at the right time and really increased and renewed my interest in jazz. I'm not sure how I missed this album for as long as I did. Anyway, there are almost 700 reviews for this CD, so all I'll say is, this is a classic, must, must, MUST have CD, and if you like jazz and for some odd reason don't have this one, you must make it a priority to get this CD before you buy anything else. You will be ecstatic.

B000002GAF|5.0|This cd takes me back.  When I was stationed in Germany, I made a very close friend in an Italian guy who was stationed there at the same time.  We both loved our music.  One day he pulled out this vinyl of some guy I had never heard before.  I was floored.  The music was stirring and the vocals were dynamic.  Since that time, the songs from this album have been in my head.  I listened to the sample tracks and knew right then I had to have this CD.  My MP3 is going to be giving this one a lot of playing time.<br />This is kind of a jazz, soul, pop thing.  I highly recommend it.  A must have for your audio collection.

B000094HMU|5.0|Wow! Before I purchased this dvd, my experience with Turandot was \\"Nessun Dorma\\" by Pavarotti. When I saw the Domingo/Marton Met Opera version, I found a clip on YouTube and loved it. I heard this on surround sound, and it was quite overwhelming. Just a joy to see and hear-I have heard criticisms of both Domingo and Marton, but I couldn't find a single note to complain about!<br /><br />BUY THIS!!!!!
B0009S5AEE|4.0|Both books by David Allen: \\"Getting Things Done\\" and \\"Ready for Anything\\", are amazing. I recommend starting with the first book and then proceed to the second one. I have reviewed \\"Getting Things Done\\" on January 3, 2003, and since that, did not find a better English-writing author on productivity and time management. The only one who is as influential as David Allen is Gleb Arkhangelsky, with his famous book \\"Time Drive\\" and other titles.    \\"Ready for anything\\" is a shorter reiteration of David Allen's principles first laid out in the \\"Getting Things Done\\", but this reiteration has deeper philosophical approach.    The most valuable technique that I have borrowed from David Allen is e-mail management habits. While there are many books devoted to email like \\"The Hamster Revolution\\", \\"Never Check E-Mail In the Morning\\", \\"Time Management for System Administrators\\", for me the framework by David Allen is the most actionable, which I'm using successfully for five years so far.    I can also recommend the audio version of \\"Ready for anything\\".
B00005JPNY|4.0|A super film which suffered from attacks from the religious right. It deserves being seen as it is exciting entertainment with a serious side. I hope they produce the sequel.
B000ZN8036|1.0|This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen and I am a movie fanatic. And I have worked in the industry in Production. The story was weak as well as Sean Penn's direction. The acting was good, but the disconnect with the characters made it hard to become emotionally involved.   Skip it!!! Unless you are a hippy and plan to follow in the main character's footsteps. Emile Hirsch was great and the only reason I watched the whole film.
B0002KQNJU|4.0|This vampire comedy is akin to a Hammer Horror production with more goofs than ghouls. If you like Hammer Horror, or the works of Polanksi, then you may want to investigate this production but it doesn't take itself seriously. The other interesting reason to watch this is that Sharon Tate, Polanski's late wife (who was murdered by the Manson's followers) stars in it.<br /><br />The film has a number of titles, the most popular of which is the European title, Dance of the Vampires. The USA title of The Fearless Vampire Killers or: Pardon Me, But Your Teeth Are in My Neck, was introduced probably to reveal its a comical content.<br /><br />Jack MacGowran as Professor Abronsius is pleasing amusement. Even Roman Polanski as Alfred, Abronsius' Assistant, puts on an interesting comical performance.<br /><br />It is not all comedy. The vampire's fangs are certainly some of the biggest you will see and the ball is errie, but the star of the show is the castle and its the main reason to watch this film. The castle is every bit as good as what Hammer has put out and then some more. The set designs from the local village pub to the castle that overlooks it, the bedrooms covered in spider webs, are first rate and inspiring.<br /><br />Dance of the Vampires, is certainly more than watchable. If you have an interest in Hammer, Polanski or just good old fashioned fun, then you can't go too far wrong with this.
B0000025JT|5.0|I wore out the album, I wore out a couple cassettes, and this was the first CD I bought.  A favorite and must have for me.
B000000W5N|5.0|how any one! can give beggars,exile,sticky or let it bleed anything but five stars are mad!  sticky fingers is a great album..thats the problem with stars etc  some people would give a new u2 album five stars and they havent produced a decent album since achtung baby and that was in the same league as goats head soup!  apart from the big tunes brown sugar etc sway is a great song.
B000MRA5NS|1.0|I'm no stranger to product placement, nor am I against it, but when I saw this movie, I couldn't help but feel the experience was cheapened by all the close-ups on Sony products.  When the camera purposely zooms in to show Blu-ray on a disc, PSP on the back of a videogame system, or Cybershot on a camera, it gets a little annoying.  It's no surprise that Sony placed all those products, it is a Sony Pictures film, but the purposely placed shots of Sony products was too much for me to handle.  There wouldn't have been an issue if there were a Pepsi sign in the background, or if a character used a Cybershot camera; but when a shot zooms in to show the brand, model, or format, I call commercial.  If this is what all James Bond movies are going to be like, I might as well just stay home and watch TV.  I don't pay to go to a theater to be bereted by a two-hour long Sony commmercial, and I won't pay to do it again.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|What of the best films I have seen in a long time. The direction is superb, concept exciting and the musical adaption brilliant. Should have received an Oscar.
B0012K1ILW|5.0|This is the kind of work that will initially confuse and confound a lot of fans but will be hailed a masterpiece years from now. Well...I'm not waiting that long. \\"4th World War\\" is the deepest, most organically funky album Ms. Badu has produced yet and it finally does something I was beginning to lose hope of ever happening; it raises the bar! R&B is usually a big yawn to me with copycat divas, generic crooners and phony 'neo soulsters' flooding the market with a glut of pedestrian, unlistenable works, so it's extremely pleasant to hear an already established and popular artist take some risks and produce an unconventional, loosely structured, ridiculously brilliant and crafty work from deep inside her mind, by sheer will, it just works. Mind you, \\"4th World War\\" isn't just great because it's different; it's great because it covers a myriad of topics (love, hate, paranoia, depression, war, sexism, addiction, love for hip-hop, aging, maturity) at such a blinding pace and without being preachy that the happy listener feels both exhausted and exhilarated after the experience. Erykah has done it again. Don't miss this one! A Masterpiece.
0064430227|5.0|I love this book and i just had to get it for center i work for!  It's a book no daycare center shold be without!
B000GCG59W|5.0|I personally love Flamenco music. I was introduced to Buika on public radio. I love this cd her voice is rich and soulful I recommend this album to anyone who likes the genre you won't be disappointed.
B000OVLBFS|4.0|I hoped the movie would do justice to the story. It almost does. The problem is not with Tom Selleck - he's perfect for the part. The problem lies in the way the story was butchered to make the film. They could have done much better - hell, I probably could have done better and I've never written a script. Still it was good and entertaining.
0735619670|5.0|If you're an experienced software developer or a newbee in the world of commercial computer programming this book will give a good kick in the right direction. Steve McConnel will keep you hooked by mixing the right guiding concepts with real-life knowledge and examples.
0316113506|5.0|A very impressive informative resource. Had the pleasure to finish the book today and be able to advise a client that exercise for my patient (her dog), will improve not only his body but his mind.
B00104W8T6|3.0|While this album does provide the essential music from the motion picture it does not seem to have too much to offer outside it's Moldy Peaches tracks which grow tiresome without the reliable backdrop of the movie. A solid enough album to reminisce on the movie but doesn't quite hold up on it's own.
0316067598|5.0|Lone Survivor is riveting, eye-opening, and educational.  Written in the voice of a true American hero, this read's simplicity is the ultimate form of sophistication.  After being captivated by this first-hand account, I purchased another copy to a friend that loves war history-but lacks the attention span to read.  Seven days later, he asked if I had any other recommendations of this nature.    Although, a few technical errors are made (C-130 called a Boeing rather than Lockheed), this recount offers amazing looks at Navy Seal School, combat strategies, muslim traditions, and an inside look at Pashtun tribe traditions and mentality.    Do yourself a favor and read this book before the movie comes out sometime next year.  Buy one copy for the family and watch how quickly it gets passed around!
B000ZLFALI|5.0|Julie Taymor's musical, Across the Universe, featuring 34 Beatles' songs plus cameo appearances by Bono, Eddie Izzard and Joe Cocker is a film I did not think I would   manner that would usually be improbably quick - but the cultural layering is both subtle and not so subtle, and the audience enjoys this phantasmagoria of a ride.    Max soon receives a notice from - you guessed it - The Selective Service - and promptly tries to think of ways with his friends to get out of appearing before the draft board. The song I Want You is layered with a poster of Uncle Sam and Max's appearance before the draft board. You have to see this scene to believe what happens next.    One of the flat mates, Prudence (T.V. Carpio), suggests that Max tell the board that he 'wants to pillage the towns and rape all the girls and women who look like her ' (she is Asian) and whammy - the painful reference to the My Lai Massacre has just been thrown.    Sadie channels Janis with her booming voice, and then, in a huff - Sadie walks off stage, leaving singing and bed partner Jo Jo (Martin Luther McCoy) alone on stage, as she channels Tina leaving Ike.    JoJo's story in the movie is worthy of a mention. JoJo (who is channeling  a softer Jimi Hendrix),  arrives in New York after his younger brother was killed in the Detroit race riots. JoJo's younger brother is seen, open coffin, in a deliberate reference to the 1955 murder of 14-year old African American Emmett Till by white men in Mississippi.    It is exactly these types of references layered in with the magical mystery tour of singing, dancing and special effects that makes Across the Universe more than just another song and dance movie or much more than another pop movie or another movie referencing the Fab Four.    The dance numbers themselves are worthy of big-time Broadway attention.    Lucy, (Evan Rachel Wood) is the high school student who lives in (a tony Connecticut suburb, the backyard to NYC) and who takes up with the leader of the student radical group SDR - Students for a Democratic Republic, as the group channels the radical SDS  - Students for a Democratic Society.    What starts out seemingly innocent enough for Lucy and the SDR does not end innocently at all. The protest movement is alive and well.    Yes, Lucy and Jude fall in love. And no, the love story is not simple. They break up at one point, and Jude later finds Lucy at a Columbia anti-war demonstration in which both are arrested. The complication of course, is that Jude is a British subject.    By the time we see Bono -  we are now post mid-1960s in the plot timeline -  somewhere around 1967 - having heard such songs as Girl, Helter Skelter, Hold Me Tight, All My Loving, It Won't Be Long,(performed by Evan Rachel Wood) Let it Be  (performed by Carol Woods and Timothy T. Mitchum),  Come Together  (performed by Joe Cocker and Martin Luther McCoy), and Why Don't We Do It in the Road? (performed by Dana Fuchs.)    Max, Lucy, Jude and others board a 'magic bus' with Dr. Robert, a shaman,  (played and sung by Bono, who - with an American accent, channels Ringo and is even Dylan-esque in his cultural references) who sings I Am the Walrus.    Joe Cocker appears as three separate street characters: Tramp, Pimp, and Hippie.    Selma Hayek appears as 5 digital representations of a nurse in the song Happiness is a Warm Gun. Another stunning set of images of song, politics, dance.    Even though the 34 songs are all songs originally written by Lennon and McCartney between 1963 and 1969, all are redone here as original compositions for the movie. The pace is slower, the songs are all sung live, with only a couple of exceptions.    If you are such a die-hard Beatle fan that seeing a newer treatment of Beatles material seems anathema to you, then I still think you will enjoy this movie. I don't know of one person of the generation who lived this who hates this movie.    If you are a fan of musicals and if you enjoy clever 1960s references, then you will  enjoy this movie. The famous song featuring Lucy only appears in the credits with Bono singing it.    Other featured songs include Revolution, While My Guitar Gently Weeps (as a tribute to MLK),  Strawberry Fields Forever. In the DVD, Jullie Taymor mentions that Strawberry Fields forever was shot live, not as a digital composition, something that surprises all viewers of this fantastic footage, graphic and realistic as it is, like a newsreel.    Stunning. Simply stunning. Art, culture and politics interwoven.
B000XB5WHW|5.0|And yes. I was one of the lucky few who didn't catch on to this CD until well after the platinum edition was released.<br /><br />THANK GOODNESS. :)<br /><br />Not that it's good to sleep on a decent pop artist these days, but if I would have bought the original release of I'm Not Dead in 2006, I would be less inclined to have purchased this one!<br /><br />And yes, Fingers is one of the greatest offerings!<br /><br />I liked it at first, but was like, \\"I thought this was gonna be better.\\"<br /><br />What makes it wicked is it's got a Dance/House beat with rock riffs. I love it so, so much!!<br /><br />Infectious.<br /><br />Addicting.<br /><br />Awesome.<br /><br />All of the above describe the beat. And the lyrics are very...thoughtfully explicit. :)<br /><br />Anyway,<br /><br />the standouts are<br /><br />Who Knew (a slept on ballad), Nobody Knows, U + Ur Hands (Bimbo Jones Remix), I Got Money Now, Fingers and Heartbreaker.<br /><br />Ones who have yet to purchase Pink's I'm Not Dead CD PERIOD, should buy this version!!!!<br /><br />For 6 bucks more than the 14-track original, you get 4 awesome, awesome bonus tracks that were only on import versions of the original release and 11 videos in all. Well worth the money.<br /><br />I bought this edition on a 2-day shipping deal, which was six dollars and ninety something.<br /><br /> Not even 7 bucks!! Now, I'm enjoying this album so much and I'm sure I'll watch the videos more too!<br /><br />Nobody Knows being my favorite. So damn relate-able. I like how in the video Pink is looking down, kind of out of tune, and then one of her friends looks over at her, and smiles, wanting her to participate, and she feigns it. &lt;3<br /><br />4.6 stars.
0786838655|5.0|Percy (short for Perseus) Jackson is a thoroughly modern hero with a long string of school failures that have been attributed to ADHD and dyslexia. As the story unfolds, he turns out to be the son of a Greek god.  No wonder he has such trouble with reading English--he's wired for ancient Greek! Who knew that those Ancient Powers still look down on human antics from Olympus, which is currently located several thousand feet above the Empire State Building? And would you believe they still take part in events that can change the course of human history? After being thrown out of yet another school, Percy finds himself at a summer camp for half-bloods like himself. There he teams up with his loyal friend, a satyr who has trouble finding footwear for his goat feet, and a wise-beyond-her-years grey-eyed daughter of Athena. What a string of adventures they have as they undertake a quest to recover a lightning bolt that was stolen from Zeus to avert a cataclysmic confrontation between the gods! Team work, cooperation, advance planning and resourcefulness solve a whole slew of problems with assorted malicious forces and monsters. Good triumphs over evil. Virtue is recognized and rewarded. Bad guys get their come-uppance.  Kids will surely clamor for more, and start fighting over the dusty tomes on the library's mythology shelf if they can't immediately get their hands on Book Two of Percy Jackson and the Olympians.<br />Janet Gingold<br />author of [[ASIN:1590923855 Finch Goes Wild]]
B000IY06CK|5.0|I never write reviews, but I heard this recording on a PBS station and had to own it.  There are no disappointments here in either the sound recording or the soloist, Julia Fischer.  What a talent!  I'm a new fan.
0439813786|5.0|This book was recommended by a family member for my children. Upon receiving the book I read it to determine if it was within my child's ability and interest. I was delightfully surprised! The book is filled with excellent illustrations consistent with Hugo Cabret's story. The story is wonderful. I enthusiastically recommend this book for young readers and adults alike. The author did a superb job with drawings, story and fact finding. Hugo Cabret is a worthy addition to any library.
B000026258|5.0|I heard parts of this cd on a show on npr radio and was intrigued enough to look it up and order a copy.  The entire cd is a beautiful flow of and interesting mix of instruments not really like anything else I've heard.  It's relaxing and inspiring at the same time.  I recommend it to anyone who enjoys instrumental music that is much more than the usual.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I love, I love, I love this movie. It is the only movie I can watch again and again. It is superbly cast and beautifully presented. Matthew Macfadyen truly IS Mr Darcy - he has bewitched me body and soul. I am sorry I can only award five stars for it is worth at least ten!
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I'll be the first to admit I was drawn in by the cute faces of the main characters. But this show is a lot more. There's something in it for everyone, including the complex Chinese subtitles that come with the DVDs, allowing even my skeptic of a non-English speaking father and mother to watch with me. Don't read Chinese? Well I don't either!  The plot is subtle, at times episodic but if you've watched your horror films (but don't worry, this show's not like that, and take it from a person who doesn't watch graphic horror anymore) then you'll recognize the references made all throughout this show.    From great classics of mullet rock in its soundtrack to witty one-liners to awesome action to a story you'll really get into, Supernatural's worth it (like Loreal). Take the time to watch an episode or two for free if you're skeptical. Thursdays on the CW.
B0009X75UG|5.0|I never really thought of Andreas as being just a New Age artist.  Sure, due to the numerous influences and the serenity of the music and the lack of a then, better term, you might be tempted.   I would say this is first rate world music.     I own several of Andreas' recording and for me, this is the best of them.   The music has more of an edge and the instrumentation is a bit different from is other recordings.  The world influences are more pronounced and delineated.   There is also a cinematic feel to this music also.       The beginning of this recording \\"Unto The Burning Candle\\" starts with a melody line that conjures the early \\"James Bond\\" thems but quicky, within seconds distinguishes itself from that and segue into an exotic mesh of eastern influenced music, complete with tablas, wordless vocals and a rich textured arrangements.  It then segues in that imitable Vollenweider style to a different mode and lighter mood to a style much like \\"Caverna Magica\\".  This, \\"Dancing With The Lion\\" (the title cut,  is lush beautiful music.   Again the vocals are well done, subtle and lend a nice texture to the music without take the focus away from the concept.  \\"Hippolyte\\" is a shot piece with a strong eastern mood which is a strong segue into one of the best pieces(movements) of this recording.  Actually it's my favorite movements, which entitled \\"Dance of the Masks\\".  It starts out elegantly and with great subtlety makes it way to a full rich  piece that features an unusual instrument for Andreas, to feature which is a rich guitar lead, followed by a very interesting piano solo, where the pianist does something piano players very seldom due, he explores the lower registers, rhythmically, then to the upper registers melodically.  It's a wonderful solo which always keeps the piece in mind, well within the concepts but bringing new accents to light.     This piece is a real highlight.   This pieces closes with lovely, cascading harmmonies leading into \\"Pearls and Tears\\"which feaures a wonderful violin solo and more well placed guitar work and harmonies.   \\"Still Life\\" features a big bodied tenor saxophone solo which fits in perfectly.   Never over powering, but embellishing.     I could go on piece by piece but suffice it to say that this is a recording well worth getting.  If you like Andreas Vollenweider, this is can't miss.  If you've never heard him, in my opinion, this is the one to get.     It goes straight to the heart, transcendent, with rich multi-cultural influences.  Of all the Andreas Vollenweider recordings, I have, this is the one I come back to most.
B0012GVKVY|3.0|I was, and am still impressed by the special effects. I really wish to see how the Blu-Ray version brings out even more of the visual excitement. I realize this has been stated once or twice before but it bears repeating, I just hope that anyone who has read the book is NOT expecting the real deal. Some reviews suggest that it holds faithful to the book in spirit if not in any other fashion. Asimov's vision of the future is at best some backdrop for car chases, shoot em ups, fight scenes and occasional witty banter. And even as a backdrop the book provides a scale and storyline the movie can't even hint at. I'd like to give it another star but to use the title and then go such a different direction, it doesn't seem fair.  Enjoy the action, enjoy the color and flair - then read the book. Perhaps in another decade or so special effects will be able to handle a more accurate rendition.
B000065DWH|5.0|Great record by an important artist!  One of Randy's best (maybe THE best) wherein all elements (composition, orchestration and lyrics) come to fruition.<br />He IS an American Institution you know.<br /><br />Oh, for the hard of thinking, the lyrics are satirical.
B0001GMIOE|5.0|As a wedding photographer, I can't waste time swapping batteries all the time.  I'll never buy the inferior fakes again.  After 6 months the fakes don't hold a charge.    Yes the Canon battery costs more, but even after 4 yrs of continual use, it's still superior to the fakes.
B000GUJHD0|5.0|I knew from over the years that a significant number of technical jobs were heading overseas; Daniel Pink does a great job of really making the loss personal. However, he doesn't just set a doom and gloom stage for left brain thinkers, but systematically explains how to slowly begin using your right brain to create new opportunities at home.    There were several key takeaways that I found to be extremely helpful as I transform myself from and Electrical Engineer to Artistic Engineer. First, and most importantly, we \\"must perform work that overseas knowledge workers can't do cheaper, that computers cannot do faster, and satisfies...[the] emotional...demand of a prosperous time.\\" The focus for me was on the emotional and \\"high touch\\" aspects of this powerful comment, since the other two aptitudes are already commoditized. I realized that for mine, and other's future, it is important to get in touch with our right brain.     The second key takeaway was how important it is to use the six senses Pink describes in order to start thinking more with your right brain. Most of the information and activities were \\"touchy feely\\", but looked more fun than grinding away at numbers. I specifically enjoyed reading the Story and Empathy aptitudes. It is true that in order to sell design that there needs to be some emotional story attached to it. Basic product attributes are no longer enough...they can just be copied. Designers need to capture the story behind the product need, and incorporate that into the design. I could not agree with Pink more when he talked about empathy and healthcare. The story about the two postmen with anthrax was tragic, but proved a point. One needs to try and put themselves in another person's situation.  This is not easy to do, especially when developing new products. Many of us are taught just to focus on the specifications and product attributes and not on the user. By being more user-centric on both a physical and emotional level, one has a better chance of developing a successful product in the Conceptual Age.    The last key takeaway that I see as extremely important is the transformation of how people perceive money. Those in the eighties felt \\"greed is good\\". Those same people are now aging baby boomers who see money as less important, and meaning or purpose as more fulfilling. Some popular examples are Bill Gates and Warren Buffet. The two wealthiest people in the world are turning a lot of their time and money towards philanthropic endeavors. In fact, Bill Gates plans to take an even smaller role at Microsoft to work on his own foundation. While these are two very prominent business people, they are a microcosm of the baby boomer generation. Pink sites many examples of services are geared towards this \\"purpose\\" generation. Where he sees services, I see products. For instance, the explosion of yoga or the holistic hospital experience will require products to fill these new needs. Through market research and user-centric design we will be able to create products that are not only functional, but touch the human emotions and give the products a higher purpose.    Daniel Pink does an excellent job of capturing the reader right from the beginning. I like how he eases the left brain reader in by technically explaining what goes on in the brain when images and emotions are show during an fMRI. He validates the \\"touchy feely\\" part that left brainers are skeptical of. This sets the reader up for a natural transformation into right brain thinking.    I also liked that Pink doesn't come off as pretentious, but as \\"one of us\\" struggling to transform his thoughts. There are several examples how he self deprecates himself or more dramatically sacrifices himself for the good of the reader. A few examples are the terrible and embarrassing self portrait and the laughing group in India. I really got the sense that Pink wants to share his experiences for the good of the reader.     It's not easy convincing a left brained thinker to believe that Design, Story, Symphony, Empathy, Play and Meaning will shape the next Age in American history. Not only does Daniel Pink convince me, but I've already bought some books (Story) and music (Mozart) he recommends. Pink did a wonderful job of not only explaining the six senses, but at the end of each chapter gave helpful information on how to continue the conversation. I wanted more, and I got it.  I will use what I read and incorporate into my daily routine. I'm off to join a laughing club.
B000002GB6|4.0|For many listeners, like myself, this album and especially the title track \\"Feels So Good\\" provided the introduction of the horn and jazz. This album was timely as it was a fusion of talent display, great jazz progressions, while staying consistent with the music style of its day.     The song, \\"Feels So Good\\" is legendary because it is the first song that comes to mind when one thinks of horn and mainstream jazz. It truly put Chuck Mangione on the map.    All tracks have the jazz session musician feel. As a listener, you are drawn in (no matter how many times you've heard it) - as if you were there in the studio with the players.    Thanks Chuck and band for countless hours of enjoyment with this one!
0767824571|5.0|By far one of the funniest movies I have ever seen, Monty Python and the Holy Grail holds up to repeated viewings. The knights of the round table are all delightfully dimwitted on their quest and it is a perfect mix of song, hilarious one-liners, and physical gags: \\"Your mother was a hamster and your father smelled of elderberries!\\"; the Black Knight ('tis but a scratch); the Killer Rabbit; the Holy Hand Grenade; \\"cut down a tree with...a herring!\\". It is hard to believe it was made for just peanuts and only in 5 weeks, this comedy has stood the test of time.
0975991477|2.0|There's a problem in Lipton's thesis, and I will be brief. Take a cell from any part of the body. Raise in a tissue culture of varying chemicals. You can create a fat cells, a muscle cells, a skin cell, or even a brain cells. The cells has all the information to become various kinds of cells and this doesn't have to be stem cells. That's is by far significant, but to go from a tissue culture to a brain controlling the makeup of the cells that can become fat cells, and other cells is somewhat of a fundamental leap gone too far. Even if the brain were to have instructions to cause, mostly electrical, for a cells to become different cells, that would be interesting. But in science this remains to be proven. Even if I were to speculate that your given the power of transcendental meditation or your own thoughts to create a heart or a missing organ such as a spleen is going too far. It hasn't been done yet, although a more realistic claim would be to put chemical baths to create that would have been more of a real world science. To go from hard science to mysticism here is not science, but a speculation of sorts. Even if this speculation were to be true, it is beyond applications what me the reader can do. The only way the brain can do anything to cause a regeneration of an organ is not presented in the book at all, but we are left with just speculation. Speculation is fine but where is the beef? I know it might be there, but it would be nice if I can see the beef. That's the basic weakness of Lipton's book where in the world can we make a quantum leap from a tissue culture that can create any cells in the body to a brain that can do everything? It leaves me wondering. I would rather let Lipton explain how to make my fat cells on my overweight body just by the power of the mind to become a muscle cell would be a far more interesting idea. Now it leaves me empty in my stomach and just me alone as to how he did that in his laboratory without detailed explainations. Certainly a more rational theory in change cells to be anything you want, more likely is best explained away by an even simpler hypothesis: you are what you eat. Body builders has been doing that for years in controlling obesity: take plenty of proteins and avoid the carbohydrates and fats. That alone I think would be a far more interesting thesis in itself. If I were to speculate a brain can regenerate the organs, than why doesn't it regenerate when a doctor remove the spleen. Something's wrong with the brain or that we aren't getting enough stem cells or is it that we haven't found a way to regenerate the cells yet. Perhaps we will, but at the very least I think Dr. Lipton should at least try to provide some tissue culture sampling that he can create different cells with just electrical stimulus with a general media tissue culture that resembles more like a blood instead of specialized chemical TO CREATE various specialized cells. That alone, I would applaud his work..but the thesis of the book is not a good one. What I can offer positively to regenerate the missing organs is obviously what brain signals is sent to the stomach or liver, and record that electrical signals. Then we stimulate the tissue culture using a standard blood medium, if the tissue specialized, then that alone would pave away to a much more powerful science of being able to prove that electrical signals from the brain can regenerate or heal the body. But I am sorry to say Lipton has disappointed me greatly. It's one of my dreams as a biochemist student over 30 years ago to do this very phenomenon, but I ended up doing computer plumbing and selling woman's perfume instead. It can be done and I have done that before, at least on the amputations of animals to regenerate limbs. Organs can be possible. But for those who is down to earth, I might just try the scenar machine to heal my wounds.
B000PKG7I4|5.0|In my opinion, the CD, 'FRANK' by Amy Winehouse is VASTLY superior to her second release, 'BACK TO BLACK.' And 'BACK TO BLACK' is a GREAT piece of work. It is as one reviewer pointed out. 'FRANK' is ABSOLUTE PERFECTION. ABSOLUTE PERFECTION! It is the ONLY CD I have been listening to for the past month. I just cannot get over it! It brings tears to my eyes. Its beauty is beyond description. As with another reviewer, it is the only CD in my truck.    My favorites are EACH and EVERY song. Particularly, MR. MAGIC, IN MY BED, TAKE THE BOX, STRONGER THAN ME, and YOU SENT ME FLYING, KNOW YOU NOW, WHAT IS IT ABOUT MEN, I HEARD LOVE IS BLIND, AMY AMY AMY, MOODY'S MOOD FOR LOVE, OCTOBER SONG, OUTRO, and F*** ME PUMPS. In that order. If Amy is able to solve her drinking, and man problems, she just may go on to become the greatest female singer/songwriter of our time. I wish her well.
B000002UV9|5.0|I've kept up with Queensryche through every album. Empire has a special place in my heart, along with all the rest of their albums, from G. Tate's incredible voice, to all the rest of the band, and the talent they have at matching music and lyrics.    They didn't miss a beat with this album, keeping me entranced all the way through to Anybody Listening? I honestly can't give a favorite song, because the whole album is full of them. Only one thing beats this album, and that was watching them play it live.    They will always have a spot in my top 5 list of favorite bands, and this album is a big reason for it.     I'll only waste time on the \\"this album is better than that album\\" to make one point......there IS no bad Queensryche album....
B0012Q94QW|2.0|I went to this movie expecting it to be a fantasy; therefore, I suspended my logic. I just wanted to enjoy the special effects. They turned out to be a mixed bag. They are riveting, and look real in the scenes where the doldos (giant birds) chase and kill the men. The mastodons look impressive and convincing too. However the saber-toothed tiger look obviously fake. The ending scenes where the pyramid was being built are one of the most spectacular I ever seen. It looks huge, lively and beautiful.     The plot is an exact copy of Apocalypto. Yet this film does not have the suspense and intensity of Apocalypto. The acting is not convincing either. At the end, a few people laughed when the female character was resurrected from her death but I didn't mind. I had already expected it to be a fantasy.     Overall, it's worth watching once for curiosity. Everybody who likes dinosaurs will certainly wants to see this picture. As for me, after seeing this, I pulled out the DVD copies of \\"Walking with Dinosaurs\\" from BBC and viewed them. They look  real and much more interesting.
B0000E6XKN|4.0|I was really looking forward to receiving this disc.  Although I think he wails for a little too long in some of his solos, I have to admit Santana is one talented musician.    I won't go into each song individually as some reviewers have done here.  I personally believe you already know the songs you're getting when you're buying in this format...  perhaps you own the CD / have heard the songs before, and you want to hear it in a new light.    Well, overall the songs are great.  They really are.  Santana brought in great talent to accompany him, and I do NOT see it as a sell-out album, like some people have said here.  True, this makes this album more \\"poppish\\" than previous works, but there are still many tracks that are true to his old style.    That said, I was expecting a little more from this DVD surround mix. The sound quality itself is great - something we demand from these type of discs.  And you DO get the sense that you're being enveloped by sound better than the CD.  But it's the mixing itself seems like it was lazily done.  The rear channels weren't utilized for much more than accentuating the occasional piano track or reverb.    Would I still recommend this disc?  Yes, I would.  Would I recommend this format?  I would, solely based on the fact that it sounds cleaner and crisper than the audio CD version.  Just know that the \\"surround\\" that's being advertised is more from reverb than anything else.
B000K15VSA|5.0|That pretty much says it all.<br /><br />I'm not going to go into the plot.  That has been hashed and rehashed here over and over many times.<br /><br />Warner Brothers finally gives Scott's Sci-fi masterpiece the treatment it deserves.  5 different versions of the film, commentaries, interviews, documentaries, etc.  Any and all of your questions are answered in the extensive bonus material.<br /><br />The final cut is a sight to behold.  If you have a widescreen TV and a good sound system, you're in for a real treat.  Watch it at night with all the lights off and the sound crancked.

Bagger will stop at nothing to exact his revenge and kill Annabelle ... slowly, luxuriously and very, very painfully!<br /><br />Meanwhile (one might say, back at the ranch!), someone is assassinating past members of Oliver Stone's elite 666 squad, a CIA assassination team. Three down and two to go. John Carr, \\"officially\\" dead, killed and buried many years earlier, lives disguised and in deep cover as lowly Oliver Stone. The only remaining \\"live\\" members of the team are Senator Roger Simpson, a front-running candidate for the big seat in the Oval Office in the White House, and Carter Gray, director of the CIA. They're so worried that Gray reaches the decision to exhume John Carr's coffin thereby revealing the fact that John Carr is still alive and well. Oliver Stone is being held out as bait for the assassin.<br /><br />\\"Stone Cold\\" is jam-packed with fast paced Hollywood style action and dialogue to be sure but it's completely successful and enjoyable nonetheless! A great reprise of some international cold war style spy vs spy intrigue together with a story revolving around a sleazy, despicable crime boss and his quest to exact revenge on the babe he might have loved but who stole his respect and honour instead.<br /><br />Friendship, loyalty, love, honour and duty are themes that ripple through both interwoven stories and the ending, in particular, while shocking (in great thriller style) is warm and pleasing. It's certain to bring a lump to the throats of many readers.<br /><br />That said, some readers will be disturbed by the extent to which a few threads at the end of the story are left untied. But, for me, that just spells sequel and I'll spend the next few months waiting with bated breath.<br /><br />Highly recommended for lovers of suspense thrillers and fans of David Baldacci and his wonderful creation, The Camel Club.<br /><br />Paul Weisssequel and I'll spend the next few months waiting with bated breath.

B0011NVCO8|4.0|Denzel Washington plays the part of Frank Lucas, a gutsy black gangster who sets himself apart from the Mafia by importing and selling drugs on his own.  As he builds his empire, an honest and persistant cop (Russell Crowe)sets out to catch him.  As Lucas's money and power increase, Crowe closes in on his operation.  This is a compelling and well-done movie which shows the hypocrisy of a gangster, living an orderly family life, while other people's children die from the drugs that he distributes.  Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe play the fascinating cat-and-mouse game of two men who are both very good at what they do, and they provide a very good evening's entertainment.
0767827902|3.0|At the time I saw this movie I was probably under age 30.  Didn't really pay much attention to the story line but loved many of the old songs remembered from childhood. I saw it on TV but was in-and-out of the room in which it was playing.  In the very last scene, a radio can be heard in the background: a comic recording (a la Arlo Guthrie) telling a very funny story of a town's use of Grandma's lye soap.  At that point I lost all interest in the movie characters as I had been looking all my adult life for that recording.  I turned up the volume to hear the very little of the recording that was included and missed the dialogue between the characters.<br /><br />I continued to search for the recording (it may have been entitled \\"It's in the Book\\") off-and-on for many more years with no luck.  After reading so many of the reviews here I want to sit down and watch the entire movie again.  I will still love the music but it's now more than 35 years later, I'm far more mature, and I'm certain my rating will be higher than that of so long ago.  I shall purchase both the movie and the soundtrack.  No one has indicated anything on the soundtrack other than songs, but I'll settle for that.

B0012QE4QC|3.0|With so many good actors, they could have done so much better. And yet, we get this, a rather boring, inconsistent and inaccurate film full of fluff. I was expecting a great and passionate love story. Granted, it is really hard to make a love story where Henry VIII is involved. In the story of the two Boleyn girls as mistresses  (and one wife) of Henry VIII, Johansson and Portman do the best with what they are given. I have nothing much to say about this movie because I didn't get much out of it. It was boring and I could not wait for it to end. The end was fitting of a Lifetime movie and the budget seems to have gone to costumes rather than producing anything of serious value.
B000000WI6|4.0|To me, after the 70's Johnny sort of hit a wall. Wasn't too crazy about his 80's stuff (hey, it was the 80's. Besides the NBA, pretty much everything sucked). But this cd kicks a**!! Sugaree, Illustrated Man, You're Humbuggin' Me--really good. Medicine Man--one of his best recordings ever. Talk about some top-notch stuff!!  This one, though not quite up there with the first two CBS records, is absolutely a must-have for Johnny fans. Nice, stripped down production. It's like they just got some good levels in the studio and went to town.
B0012Q94QW|2.0|I deliberately chose to watch this movie on a languid afternoon because I expected it not to be intellectually challenging and it happened to be true.  To a certain extent, it felt like Acapalypto but it didn't have the intensity.  It felt like an epic National Geographic's special on an IMAX screen.  The tour started in New Zealand and the Maori actors, actresses and the Central Otago scenery betrayed the location.  The special effect was less than perfect and in many scenes, we could detect that the performance was acted in front of a green or blue screen.  As the main character chased after his girl to a warmer climate, that's when we shifted the focal point to Africa and ended up in Egypt.  The greatest flaw of the movie was having the characters speaking English as if it's already been established as the lingua franca of its time.  Then, there were scenes of sabre tooth, mammoths, giant vultures and doldos which didn't seem to fit in with geography of places that they went to.  The soundtrack was a bit syrupy for my liking and just imagine if Hans Zimmer was used instead, it would have increased the impact quite significantly.  The script wasn't tight at all and the dialogues were corny at best.  Cliff Curtis, arguably the veteran among the youngsters here added a bit of grunt and screen presence.  Otherwise, the rest were simply bubble-ish and forgettable at best.  There were instances we were reminded that we were back in Jurassic Park, Godzilla or even King Kong with the stampede scene.  I think Roland has the same problem that George Lucas might have during filming of Star Wars where technology ruled supreme whilst character development was relegated to second priority.  Amid the tight structure that's imposed into this movie, there's no much margin the crew could really work on.  As a result, the overall performance became rather trite and wooden.  It really could have been better.  Alas, another hit and miss.  The best way to enjoy this movie is not to have any expectation at all prior to watching the movie.  By the way, Omar Sharif's narration was overcooked too!

B00062IVKS|5.0|Jake LaMotta:one of the most talented and successful boxers of his time. Also,one of the most turbulent boxers of his time,who's personal life would,eventually,work its way into his career.    And,in \\"Raging Bull\\",all of that is covered here. Shortly after \\"Raging Bull\\" has opened(the opening scene may be in 1964,but that really doesn't take part until the end of the film),we are taken back to 1941,at the start of(Jake)La Motta's boxing career. Here,it all begins. Back and forth on \\"Raging Bull\\",we see several fights of Jake La Motta documented. Everything--the personal part of the fight--the violence and grittiness of the fight--and the fight itself--are rolled up into one. It's really quite impressive. It's like watching an actual fight,De Niro and all of the actors having their complete emotion rolled into it. The suspense and \\"beauty\\" really work well here. Not only did Robert Chartoff and Irwin Winkler(who won the Best Picture Oscar at the 1977 Academy Awards for \\"Rocky\\")produce \\"Raging Bull\\",the creativity/imagination of Martin Scorsese and the brilliant technique used by Scorsese(only one camera to film the boxing,as opposed to three,the usual method)really help a lot.    The parts that focus on La Motta's personal life stand out quite well,also. With the screenplay,direction,and acting of Robert De Niro,you get to see who Jake La Motta was as a person:violent,angry,and crude,how  he preferred to be with people \\"he liked\\",and how he preferred to be with people he \\"didn't like\\". \\"Raging Bull\\" succeeds on focusing on every other person of Jake La Motta's life and giving them enough recognition,without forgetting who the film is about. Joe Pesci can get annoying at times,but otherwise,the acting in \\"Raging Bull\\" is richly executed and contributes to the beauty of the film.    It's worth noting that most of(minus about ten-thirteen minutes)of \\"Raging Bull\\" is shot in black and white. Some people may be iffy towards actions like this for a film. But,here,it's brilliant. Through the black and white,you get immersed in the 40's,50's,and 60's. You see what the life of Jake La Motta was completely like,the time period for which it was being documented the way it is helping a lot(history fans are in for a treat with this aspect of \\"Raging Bull\\"). \\"Raging Bull\\" actually has the characteristics of any \\"old\\" film from the time period in which it takes place. Yet,it still has the same,modern standards of any film made today.    As you may have noticed,this is the two-disc,special edition of \\"Raging Bull\\". The title lives up to itself. The extras(three audio commentaries--one from Martin Scorsese and Editor Thelma Schoonmaker,the Cast and Crew Commentary,and the Storytellers Commentary,four behind-the-scenes feauturettes,and \\"The Bronx Bull\\" making-of documentary)really do spread one issue--learning about the making of the film--out. It's a very successful method. The eight bonus feautures let viewers of \\"Raging Bull\\" learn every aspect of the film being made(thumbs up for letting the real Jake La Motta have a helping hand),and all offer a fair amount of interesting and intruiging facts. The newsreel footage of Jake La Motta defending his title and the shot-by-shot comparison of Robert De Niro and Jake La Motta are impressive touches. The booklet is also quite nice with fun trivia/facts and some pictures that happen to stand out,while the actual \\"case\\" that holds the DVDS has a lot of creative and strong touches to it,as well.    If you are a harcore,American Film institute film fan,\\"Raging Bull\\" is one film not to miss.

They join together to find out.<br /><br />  This story has good characters, some romance, lots of action, and lots of excitment, but as the plot thickens it gets too thick.

Regrettably, I have very little good to say and that serves as my motivation in actually sharing my opinion with you... the potential buyer/reader.    I have one word that would describe the material in this book... AMWAY.  There is no substance at all in this book... just a bunch of one-liners and motivational speak.  If that is what you're looking for in a financial book then by all means, give your hard earned cash to Mr. Kiyosaki.  He doesn't give you one piece of solid advice.  On the contrary... he actually attempts to get you to put all of your financial eggs in one basket.  That is just one example of the wisdom this book promotes.    The only other thing it tries to get you to do is to purchase more of his products beginning with a board game he developed and now sells.  He says that it will teach you and your kids how to get out of the rat race we all find ourselves in and promote fiscal independence.  Apparently Mr. Kiyosaki has never heard of the classic board game of Monopoly.    The most useful, single page in this book is the Recommended Reading page which actually gives you some sound advice towards books which are useful except for the one authored by Zig Ziglar, another AMWAY crook.    Stay away from this book like the plague.  As far as financial advice goes, you'll do better by depositing the cost of the book into a savings account and at least get some return in your investment.  Not to mention the absolute waste of time it actually takes to read through this garbage.  They should have printed in on toilet paper because that's about the most useful use for the material printed on its paper...
B000SINT52|4.0|Let's face it. Chances are you either loved or hated this film before you even saw it. Personally, I liked it a great deal. I liked the fact that Michael Moore uses the politicians' own videotaped words to indict them, but I also disliked the insinuation in the film that American soldiers were jar-heads who enjoyed or were callous about the killing and suffering of ordinary Iraqis as a result of the war. His final thought in the film is an important one - after all the lies told about why we went to Iraq, why would anybody ever trust us again? This lack of trust is important in the context of the current 2008 Presidential election cycle. It has seen an unusually high level of participation of young people and it has seen voters of all ages largely rejecting potential nominees perceived as Washington insiders. Much of this can be traced back to the level of cynicism Moore displays in this film.<br /><br />Also, and somewhat off-topic, I have to wonder how it is that Michael Moore was able to see the damage that such quotable quotes from conservative politicians could do, and yet then-presidential candidate John Kerry could not? If I had been running Mr. Kerry's campaign I would have been constantly rewinding and replaying the moment when President Bush is speaking at a fundraiser talking about \\"his base - also known as the haves and the have mores\\". What could have done more damage to the President's faux image as some average Joe who enjoys clearing brush on his ranch in Texas? At any rate, I think that although it is somewhat dated at this point, it is still an important film and is worth viewing - just realize that this IS Michael Moore we are talking about and that he does like to go over the top quite a bit.
B00005JPOO|5.0|In this funny, cute movie, Christina Ricci stars as the young heiress Penelope. Penelope has been struck by the Wilhern family curse which causes her to have the snout and ears of a pig. The curse can only be lifted until one of her own kind loves her, which the family interprets as getting a fellow blueblood to marry her. Poor Penelope has to deal with rejection after rejection as one handsome, well-bred suitor after another pursues her for her good family name and large dowry and then flees in terror (jumping out windows to do so) as soon as he catches sight of her face. What makes it even worse is that her well-meaning but utterly shallow mother (Catherine O'Hara) is too ashamed of Penelope to let anyone but the carefully selected suitors see her daughter and keeps her isolated within the family mansion. She even went so far as to fake Penelope's death as a baby to avoid the press from getting any pictures of her cursed daughter. Furthermore, she constantly reminds Penelope that the curse is also a burden for the entire family and Penelope's goal in life is to break the curse and become prettier. Penelope's long-suffering father (Richard E. Grant) loves his daughter and is obviously exasperated by his wife's attitude, but seems too hen-pecked to stand up to his wife and insist that they allow Penelope out into the real world (the two parents remind very much of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet of Pride & Prejudice).<br /><br />When one particularly excitable and nasty suitor, Edward Vanderman (Simon Woods), runs to the press with the story that there is a pig-monster in the Wilhern household, no one believes him and he is made a laughing stock of the city. However, tabloid reporter Lemon (Peter Dinklage), who lost one of his eyes attempting to get a picture of baby Penelope, believes the Vanderman heir and agrees to try and prove Penelope's existence. Lemon tracks down a handsome young gambler with the appropriate lineage, Max Campion (James McAvoy), to pose as Penelope's suitor and get a picture of her. Max and Penelope start falling for each other while Penelope is hidden behind a two-way mirror and Max starts having second thoughts about his participation in the scheme to expose Penelope. After revealing her face to Max, Penelope takes his reaction as a rejection and decides that she's tired of waiting to break a curse that she's starting to think can never be broken. So, armed with a scarf to hide her nose, Penelope runs away to experience life outside her mansion. In the city she makes friends with the eccentric bike messenger Annie (Reese Witherspoon) and sees how much she was missing out on life by hiding from everyone.<br /><br />I went to see this movie with three female friends and we all completely loved it. It had a cute, whimsical feel, somewhat reminiscent of Pushing Daisies. Christina Ricci is charming as the sweet but weary Penelope and James McAvoy proves once again that he's great as the romantic lead. My favorite minor character is Lemon, who starts out as the possible villain, seeing as how he wants to expose Penelope to the world, but who is really not a bad person at all. Catherine O'Hara as the mother is a scene-stealer, although her character's tragic focus on beauty keeps her from being one of my favorite characters (what is even scarier is that there really are mothers like this out there).<br /><br />The biggest complaint my friends and I had was that James McAvoy wasn't allowed to keep his Scottish accent, which was odd because the movie wasn't set in any particular city or country and several of the extras did have British accents (McAvoy did a fine American accent, but we would have preferred his original one). It was also a bit silly that the suitors were so horrified by Penelope's appearance that they'd jump out windows to escape her, considering that even with a snout Christina Ricci was still pretty darn cute. The movie also got a little cheesy near the end, but it kept itself from going completely intocheesy territory with the mother's continued shallowness. This is highly recommended for anyone who is looking for a light, diverting film and I definitely plan on buying the DVD.h the mother's continued shallowness.

B000UNYJXQ|4.0|Why not socialized medicine? Well, most conservatives will tell you that socialized medicine brings long waits/no treatment at all, nightmarish bureaucracies, inflated health care costs, and detrimental government interference in people's lives.<br /><br />But, as \\"Sicko\\" reveals, the American health care system already has all those problems.<br /><br />I didn't like other Michael Moore documentaries, but this one is very well done.  He shows (correctly) that the health care industry is damaging from top to bottom.  It doesn't help people, and it isn't designed to.  In fact, in many instances, the industry destroys peoples' lives.  The only people it actually helps are the C.E.O.s and shareholders of drug and insurance companies.  Having insurance in America is like pre-paying at a restaurant, and then having them try their best NOT to feed you.<br /><br />Still, I did have a few problems with this film:<br />1) In a documentary about health care, Moore gets slightly off-topic when praising the French system by praising French society in general.  I won't spoil the movie for you, but I will say that some of the lavishness the French government doles out on their citizens seems excessive, and I kept wondering \\"who's paying for this?\\"<br />2) Moore does a sub-standard job addressing criticisms of socialized medicine, especially higher taxes.<br />3) He briefly (by way of interview with a former British politician) injects the idea of a conspiracy to keep Americans sick so they will be more docile for the phantom powers-that-be.  This undermines the credibility of the film as a whole.<br />4) Being Michael Moore, he has to mention Iraq in the film.  He does so twice, once in relation to health care, and another for no reason at all.  The latter bugged me.<br /><br />Even so, I feel every American should see this documentary, whatever your position on health care.  While I can't speak for the Cuban, French, or British systems, this is really what the American system is like.<br /><br />I already supported socialized medicine before seeing \\"Sicko\\", and I still do because of my family's history with insurance and HMOs (I have family in both America and Canada).  I see health care as a right, not a privilege, and definitely NOT a business.cine before seeing \\"Sicko\\", and I still do because of my family's history with insurance and HMOs (I have family in both America and Canada).

From here all manner of chaos ensues involving the MI 5, corrupt police officers, Michael X and a porn dealer named Vogel.     It's an entertaining enough ride, though pretty much a typical crime genre movie in most respects. But the setting in 1970's London takes it a notch higher in terms of entertainment value. Also the fact that it is based on such an extreme and outrageous true story makes it more interesting. This is a darker and more violent side of British society than most Americans are usually exposed to. But it's a fun escape for those seeking some fast paced entertainment.
0060512806|1.0|This is the first book by Neal Stephenson I have ever read, or I should say I have ever attempted to read. I got to page 400 and had to stop. I probably should have put the book down after 100 pages, but after so many glowing reviews and endorsements, most notably from the New York Review of Books, I thought I would give it as much of a chance as I could. What a mistake.    Maybe I should even go back farther in time - I purchased the book thinking it would be an incredibly fast read, something in the same vein as a Dan Brown or Stephen King book. I was sadly disappointed to find that all of the people who said that this 1000-page monstrosity would be a quick read were terribly, terribly wrong (I also found at least two other people who thought the same thing and I wish I had listened to them when they told me to stop).    The book bounces back and forth between World War II and the present day, between grandparents and grandchildren in an all-over-the-map techno-thriller that is simply too dense to be readable. The pacing can only be described as plodding. I find Dickens a quicker read.    I think I may have started reading this with the wrong-mind set and maybe I should give it another go in a few years. But for all those looking for a nice-light read, stay away. And for those looking for something that makes you think or something where you can enjoy the texture of the language, stay away as well. Go out and pick up some Virginia Woolf or even some Dickens. It will be time much better spent.

Of course the videos are great - all of them - but the extras that make this the \\"Ultimate Collector's Edition\\" are what really stand out.

B0013J559S|4.0|Despite a weak, B-rate feeling opening, The Bank Job manages to pull itself up and shape into a wildly engaging, gritty, realistic heist film that holds nothing back and does not have the comfy, playful feel of the Ocean's films. And here's the kick: its' based on a true story.      Yes that's right, it is based on the true story of the 1971 Baker Street Bank robbery in England, considered to be one of the biggest bank robberies in British history. Terry Leather (played by Jason Statham) is in a spot of trouble. He owes money to some criminal bigwig, so when an old friend Martine Love (Saffron Burrows) comes along with a proposition for him and his two mates to rob a small bank's safety deposit box vault, he takes it. As they begin their job everything fits perfectly into place and moves along at a smooth pace...an almost too smooth pace as very quickly the little proposition spirals madly out of control with secrets and double crossing being revealed, all before coming to a surprising ending.      I was disappointed that characters were not as fleshed out and developed as I would have liked. However, Terry is done very well and I feel Jason Statham, the most underrated action movie star, has an almost Bruce Willis-type presence.      The acting and dialogue was good, Saffron Burrows gives a bristling nuanced performance, and Terry's two mates Daniel Mays and Stephen Campbell Moore both bring a balanced energy to gang of criminals.      The Bank Job is a rough, somewhat violent heist film that does not have a fun feel to it, however as it picks up from the mediocre beginning it holds you with a raw intensity that rewards you even more once the credits roll as you read the real life aftermath of the characters.
B000W93CHC|5.0|I read pillars for fun, never looking for great lit, but at the same time realizing it was getting later and later into the night and I was not putting the book down.     I felt the same way about World. I read both back to back in one week.     If I can read 2000 pages in a week, Follett is doing something very right.
B0012Q94QW|4.0|The trailers for 10,000 B.C. says \\"...Journey back to a time of darkness, Journey to a world lost in time\\" and boy oh boy, do you journey. From the opening of the film you are swept up into a stone age village in the lofty peaks of the Himalayas, next a jungle filled with prehistoric creatures, then it is an African desert plain complete with a saber-tooth tiger, all before coming to the banks of the Nile to witness the building of the Great Pyramid. All this and more is delivered to you in the diverse locations covered in 10,000 B.C. a film about the beginning of time and civilization.      The film opens with narration from Omar Sharif and the story begins in a tiny mountain top village of mammoth hunters which is ravaged by \\"four-legged demons\\" (Hun-style soldiers on horses) who capture and kill most of the villagers, save for a handful. Among that handful is a man, D'leh (played by Steven Strait), whose lover, Evolet (played by Camilla Belle) was among the many dragged off as slaves. D'leh and two other warriors waste no time in setting off in hot pursuit of demon raiders. So the journey starts as they trek across every possible extreme landscape up until they find their villagers have been put to work as slaves to build the Great Pyramid. As the three warriors plan a way to free them they are joined by thousands of other African tribe warriors who have also lost loved ones to the slave-seeking raiders, and the final climax is one spectacular epic battle atop the pyramids including more mammoths (they apparently helped the Egyptians pull the massive stones to build the pyramids, debunking the long held theory that aliens did!).      10,000 B.C. is complete eye-candy with its' extravagant CGI, vast sets, detailed costumes, and sweeping cinematography. The acting is average, nothing amazing, but nothing bad. The script is very basic but it works because you would not expect our prehistoric ancestors to break out in eloquent or snappy dialogue.      Overall I was highly entertained and satisfied with outcome. Despite the film having less historical accuracy than even the recent atrocious flop, The Other Boleyn Girl, it still manages to be a good film that holds your eyes with its' magnificent visuals as well as your interest with its' characters that have just enough emotion and heart to be able to invest and connect with them (even if just slightly). 10,000 B.C. is pure exhilarating entertainment, and does what a film should--lets you escape back to a time of darkness, to a world lost in time!    (8/10)
B0011NVC9I|4.0|I loved this movie, it really keeps your attention. The animation<br />and special effect were really good. I would go see a sequel of this movie in a moments notice. Could hardly wait for it to come<br />to DVD to add to my Collection. JH
B000Y7U98C|5.0|Ever since \\"Trainspotting,\\" I've been a fan of Danny Boyle and his work.  After watching it for the second time, \\"Sunshine,\\" Danny Boyle's latest opus, is now my favorite film of his and one of my favorites in general.  It's a simple story with complex characters, strong visuals, wonderful direction, and a beautiful score.    In the near future, our Sun is dying.  To save it, the Icarus II is sent into space to deliver the \\"payload,\\" an atom bomb, into the Sun to hopefully reignite it.  As the crew is getting closer to their objective, they receive a distress beacon from Icarus I, the first spaceship sent on the mission, which was supposedly lost seven years earlier.  Icarus II decides to board, knowing that now they will have two bombs, two chances...but it's not the only thing they find.    What I just stated above is a fairly loose description of the entire story.  It's not that I left out major plot points, but more that it doesn't seem that interesting on paper.  I had this same worry coming into the film, wondering how I wasn't going to be bored the entire time.  I knew the story was going to be character-driven, but for some films, that's either good or bad depending on the way it's handled.  Fortunately, it was pulled off perfectly.    The crew of the Icarus II is full of well drawn out characters not because the viewer knows so much about them.  Rather, it's because the viewer wants to know more about them as the story progresses.  As the film unfolds, character choices and backgrounds are not flopped out on the table, but instead, revealed slowly.  Everything that is done by the crew is never ostentatious, but subtle.  From physical movements to choice of words to decision making, the viewer is allowed to observe how the characters react and interact and then make their own decision about how they feel about the certain person.  The characterization in this film is one of the best I've ever seen, due to the writing and impeccable acting.    Out of the cast, there were a few standouts that made the film outstanding.  Cillian Murphy simply draws you into the film, either with his expressions or distress.  As the only one who knows how to actually set the bomb off, he has the heaviest burden on his shoulders and he makes that evident throughout the film.  The captain of Icarus II is played by Hiroyuki Sanada, whose tenacity to get the job done no matter what the cost was shown greatly and believably.  Finally, the actor who keeps the entire film together is Chris Evans.  Known mainly for the \\"Fantastic Four\\" films and \\"Not Another Teen Movie,\\" he's definitely broken out of that mold and into something great.  For me, he was the glue of this film, holding it all together.  As much as he may seem hot-headed at one moment, he is passive and relaxed the next.  His character always knows what's at stake and what must be done to complete the mission and Evans knows how to portray that.    Besides the acting, the film is also a visual feast.  The sun itself is something to behold and the complex design of Icarus II is wonderfully rendered.  Watching the spaceship surrounded by the darkness of space, Mercury passing in front of the sun, and the design of the \\"payload\\" are standouts in a film stock full of them.    As the film ended, the first thing I did was search for the musical score.  John Murphy and Underworld have crafted music that is haunting, lonely, but most of all, uplifting and inspiring.  There were many times throughout the film that the score made what was happening on screen stronger and engaging.    Danny Boyle is on the ball as always.  His shot composition is perfect when it comes to dialog and when it comes to action and suspense.  The effect he used to portray one of the characters in the story is effective and compares nicely with that of the Sun.  Boyle moves the film along at a fairly slow pace, but it never feels like it.  He's truly created a spectacle to watch.    \\"Sunshine\\" is my favorite film of Danny Boyle's and one of my favorite films.  It's not an action, special effects blockbuster like \\"Armageddon.\\"  It's much more than that.  Filled with complex characterization, awe-inspiring visuals, and a beautiful score, it moves the viewer to places that other films never can.
0525950079|2.0|This book was about 300 pages too long.  So much unnecessary detail, so much rehashing of the plot. At 1,000 plus pages I guess Follett felt it constantly necessary to remind readers what happened at earlier stages along the way.  It was insulting to read recaps of the character's crucial junctures as they moved ahead to new, life-altering moments.  One saving grace was the historical aspect.  But where the outstanding \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" showcased that with tightly constructed characterizations and plot, this one felt contrived, with many implausible twists and instances of writerly \\"showing off.\\"  It will keep you reading, but mostly because you just want to be finished with it.
B000F5GNX8|4.0|After thinking about how to review this film, I think I've finally got it. The reason I'm having a problem with writing about it is because I don't really know how to place the film. It's got comedy, but it's also got drama. It's got mystery, but it's also got action. \\"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang\\" is a pot full of different genres mixed together into one final product...and it's awesome.     New York small-time crook, Harry (Robert Downey Jr.), accidentally ends up in California, where he is to be screen-tested for a movie being made. The character is a detective so to make him better acquainted with the role, the producers bring in \\"Gay Perry\\" (Val Kilmer), a detective consultant. After a routine stake-out, Harry and Perry end up with a dead body on their hands. Everything goes downhill from there.     Written by Shane Black (\\"Lethal Weapon\\" films and a little gem called, \\"The Monster Squad\\"), \\"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang\\" is clever, action-packed, filled with great characters, and riddled with hilarious, witty dialogue. If you're a true fan of movies, this a film you must see. It's ideas about Hollywood, actors, and happy endings are unique and refreshing. It also doesn't hurt that Harry narrates the entire story either.     Robert Downey Jr. is an actor I never really thought much about. This isn't because I didn't like him as an actor, it was just that I couldn't place him in any certain film. Well, now, I'm always going to think of him as Harry Lockhart. At times, he's sarcastic, while other times, confused or angry or scared. Whatever the case may be, he plays them all to a T. Val Kilmer (the second best Batman) is a true presence in this film. Whenever he shows up, you're even more glued to the screen than you were before. Michelle Monaghan could have easily played the damsel in distress card and phoned it in, but she really makes the most of her character. Both her and Downey Jr. are great together.     The look and feel of the film were exceptional as well. Color filtering and rich textures created a glitzy, yet dangerous atmosphere that worked well with the film's story.     \\"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang\\" is a film that should be checked out by anyone that calls themselves a movie buff.  Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer are outstanding and the story is intricate and fun.  It's incredibly entertaining, fast-paced, and ridiculously funny.
B00005JNJV|5.0|I have seen every Batman movie, from the Adam West \\"BAM\\" romps of the 60s to George Clooney's impersonation of the American Detective, and feel that Christian Bale's Batman is the best. Bale is quite an underrated actor. From the Empire of the Sun, American Psycho, Reign of Fire, Equilibrium, to Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, Bale has done a superb job in each film. I am actually thrilled to see him being cast for the role of John Connor in Terminator 4.<br /><br />Bale's Batman reminds me of Kevin Conroy's voice acting for the Animated Series. Batman is supposed to be a figure of the night, striking fear into the hearts of evil doers. That includes voice acting that would give the darkest of souls goosebumps in an alley at night. I never understood how the other Batman costumes could realistically do that, especially with nipples molded into the chest plate.<br /><br />One of the more memorable scenes in Batman Begins include the Tumbler chase scene. The Tumbler is a welcome change from the more traditional representations of the \\"Batmobile\\" and looks more like a candidate for the next military tactical vehicle than a superhero's car.<br /><br />I look forward to viewing The Dark Knight as many of the trailers show a similar amount of professional acting and a solid plot. If you have not seen Batman Begins, I highly recommend borrowing, renting, or buying a copy especially if you are interested in the Batman story line.
B00008WT49|5.0|I've listened to this in standard stereo CD, SACD stereo and SACD multi channel. SACD stereo sounds much better with this. She's sitting there right in front of me. I love the music and they did a superb job on the 2 channel SACD. Out of about 30 or so SACD's (and 400 CD's) I have this is one of my favs.
B00003CY6M|4.0|This is a great John Cusack movie (but aren't they all!).  If life were only this way.  I highly recommend this movie
B00004I9VE|5.0|Regarding the SACD sound on this CD - it is one of the best in my collection. It is 2 channel, which is how it was recorded and thus sounds more alive and natural than the CD layer sound. Surround sound ruins many good stereo recordings and I'm glad they didn't do that to this one. If the sound from this doesn't come at you primarily from the center, then your stereo isn't setup correctly.
B0001MDP3G|5.0|This will go down as a classic-along with \\"The Notebook\\".  What else is there to say if you're a romantic?  I never tire of watching it.
B000WTNCYA|5.0|I heard Melody Gardot on NPR and was mesmerized by her voice. I went right to the computer to find out more about her and her CDs. I love the timbre of her voice. There's a certain \\"earthiness\\" that is very engaging. I think this young women is destined for greater things.
B000X5KSWM|5.0|Forget Nightwish, Tarja's back with a vengeance!<br /><br />Given the extremely disappointing CD Nightwish gave us with their new singer I wasn't expecting much from Tarja, heck I didn't know she was even working on anything. However, even though I adored her work with Nightwish, I always thought Nightwish was a huge reason those CDs were so good. One listen to My Winter Storm and you'll quickly find out that that wasn't the case at all. The first three songs alone put Nightwish's newest offering to shame on all fronts.<br /><br />What I love about My Winter Storm is the fact that it has these gorgeous, sweeping interludes that play perfectly into each and every song. Thus making this one of those CDs you can listen to completely, without hesitation. Where Nightwish CDs were sometimes exhausting to listen to completely, Tarja's solo effort doesn't fall victim to that...which is definitely a good thing.<br /><br />Did you love Tarja before? You'll love her even more now. Some of the music that accompanies her on here is nothing short of breathtaking. Take the symphonic heaviness of Lost Northern Star for example. Or even the calm, toy-esque beginning of My Little Phoenix. It just doesn't stop! Then you also have the classic moments you know you're gonna be left wanting to hear over and over again, such as the climax of Boy And The Ghost most notably. I'm hardpressed to think of a single hole in this CD, all the bases are covered magnificently.<br /><br />My favorite songs are I Walk Alone, Lost Northern Star, Boy And The Ghost, Our Great Divide, and Ciaran's Well. Not enough good things can be said about this release. Most anything good you hear about My Winter Storm will have merit behind it, it's just that good. Listen and enjoy!
B000ZINGIK|5.0|Fans of Edguy and Tobias must get this album.  It is different in many ways from a standard Edguy album, but excellent nonetheless.  It's more geared to wards rock, but with a few heavy songs.  The Scarecrow is a great piece of work.  The song \\"I don't believe in your love\\" is another fine song with an awesome mixture of vocals.  Overall the casting if you will for this album was nothing short of genius.  Get it.
B0011NVC9I|3.0|I enjoyed it.  The graphics are amazing, and the story is a new re-imagining of a classic epic.  Fun.

B0011HOEY4|4.0|I wanted to see this film because there was a lot of buzz about it and because I like gangster films.  However, I never read much about it first, and therefore didn't realize that it was based on a true story which happened in the 1970s.  I saw it simply as another Hollywood formula flick with Denzel Washington cast as the drug kingpin and Russell Crowe cast as the honest cop who brings him down.  That said, I relaxed and enjoyed the film, but I must say that I laughed out loud often because of what seemed like a very contrived plot.  For example, the cop character turns in a million dollars in unmarked bills making him hated by other cops and therefore incorruptible.  And the African American drug kingpin from the South buys a house for his mama.  Denzel Washington plays it cool, so cool in fact that he seems unreal, especially in the scenes where he goes to Southeast Asia to buy drugs from the source.  He is always dapper and in control of all emotions.  His role called for little if any subtleties.  Russell Crowe, on the other hand, had a more difficult role to play.  His character was always full of self doubt.  In spite of that, or perhaps because of that, it became a mission for him to arrest Denzel Washington.  How it all plays out makes a fast, well paced film, which held my interest throughout.<br /><br />It was only at the end of the film that I realized that the story was real, and then I went flying to the internet to learn more background.  This gives the film a different context and I appreciated it more.  But I just can't help remember how funny some of the stereotypes were.<br /><br />Recommended for some light entertainment, but American Gangster doesn't even get on the playing field when compared with a show like the Sopranos.
0385338724|5.0|Lexi reminds me of Becky from the Shopaholic series and I think that's why I love this book so much. The idea was clever and the characters were awesome. I can practically picture Jon right in front of me, he's so realistic, and I want him to be my husband!! Good job with the chemistry between him and Lexi. Can't wait for Kinsella's next!
0143038419|1.0|This book is one of the worst books I've ever read. I can't believe all the hype and good reviews. What a load of twaddle. It was painful to read. If I hadn't had to read it for my store's book club I wouldn't have made it past the first section, and I rarely will not finish a book, even if I'm not particularly too impressed with it. The author is a self-congratulatory, insincere, shallow, whiner. Even her depression seems fake. She travels to Italy, India and Bali and all she can do is whine about her breakup with the boyfriend that she had before even before she was divorced. She can't stand to be by herself and there is good reason -- there's nothing there. I don't know how she could have travelled to these places and yet none of the places themselves seem to have any impact on her other than the shallow anecodotes we get of her interactions with other people. Mostly, it is whining and tedious, inconsequetial detail about how wonderful she is. Anyway, don't waste your money. Not one person in our book group liked it. All we came away with was that the author is a really unlikable person.

It seems to have the perfect balance between mystery and action and comedy as well with a teeny bit of romance in there too!

B000AYEL6U|3.0|I heard about this film from a friend and found it to be one of my favorite timepiece films.<br /><br />It takes us through the life of a woman who lived in the southern rural part of England with her parents.  He father abruptly moves their little family to the northern urban part of England, with a faster-paced city life, which takes its toll on the family.<br /><br />In the process, however, much good happens to the family, and they are able to change their ways and also end up changing their attitudes on things that they had before prejudged.  The cons are that it does move pretty slow and seems to be more of a sad tale, with a happy ending. See what you think about it =)

0307386864|4.0|The core character in this novel is Elizabeth, an attractive and intelligent 20 year-old and the second daughter (out of five) of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet.  .  Her mother's main interest is to see her five daughters, all eligible, nicely settled down and married to respectable and rich gentlemen.<br />Elizabeth's personality, very unlike her mother's, unfolds throughout the pages in a crescendo of  emotions resulting from various issues connected with the whole family saga and especially to her own contrasting feelings towards a certain young man, Mr. Darcy.  Will Elizabeth's passionate and sensible nature, combined with a certain degree of boldness (for those days), make her discover what lies beyond his seemingly unpleasant and unreadable personality?<br />The graceful politeness in the prose is charming, delineating a faithful image of life at the end of the 18th century in England.<br /><br />The intrigues beyond wished-for marriages are very accurately described by Ms. Austen, with a touch of humour \\"hither and thither\\".  I could  not help myself comparing similar issues with nowadays. Beyond the characterisation and a part from the language, style and general progress, I believe that human nature, as depicted, is the same as it always was and it is not all just about \\"love\\", it is also about people attempting to incorporate into a higher position in society, seeking integration at a greater level.  It was also interesting, I thought, to see how relevant (or irrelevant) the \\"worth\\" bestowed on the female gender was back then, compared to the present day in most societies.  This, combined with the rapidity with which one fell in love, got engaged and/or was forbidden or denied to marry, could be stimulating subjects for ensuing conversations.

0201633612|5.0|Most of the books I have read about object oriented programming were about some specific language and failed to provide a more general way to think about solving problems without writing a lot of code.  This book was a missing link for me and I wish I had read it sooner.  The authors provide you with elegant ways to use object oriented language features to simplify your programming solutions.    When the specs on your project change and you have to re-factor your code, you may be able to use a design pattern from this book to simplify your solution and make your design more flexible with regard to the parts of the spec that are changing quickly.

B000002LIX|4.0|Jane's Addiction-Ritual De Lo Habitual ****<br /><br />Easily the bands strongest album released with the original line up of Perry on vocals, Dave Navarro on guitar, Stephen Perkins on drums, and Eric on bass. As far as the Strays album which was released with another bass player it was good for an arena rock band, but not for an alternative act of Jane's callober. Released in 1990 before a world tour which would be the bands last due to creative difference this would only be the bands second studio before they imploded.<br /><br />In a nut shell the album is based and centered around the focal point of the album, the song 'Three Days' which is the story of a three day sexual experince Perry had with two other women, which is also dipicted on the albums cover. This song is a roller-coaster filled with slowed tempos and fast breaking instrumental assaults. Dave Navarro's guitar solo is easily the best thing he ever recorded. Other highlights on the album include the opening track and minor hit 'Stop!' which starts the album off perfectly. 'No One's Leaving' is another rocker which keeps the albums going nicely. 'Been Caught Stealing' is the albums big hit single, and went on to be one of the 1990's most memorable songs. 'Classic Girl' closes the album and may very well be the very best song that Jane's Addiction ever pinned. Describing the song would do no good as you really must hear it to understand it, and beside describing it would be damn near impossible. 'Ain't No Right' and 'The She Did...' are also memorable.<br /><br />Ritual was quite the swan song for Jane's Addiction. I brought everything the band stood for and wanted to convey with their music and art to the mainstream even more so then their fantastic debut, Nothings Shocking. After this Navarro would join the Red Hot Chili Peppers for a short stint and Perry would form the great Porno For Pyros but none of those side projects could compare to Jane's and Ritual in prticular. Navarro never played better guitar before or after, and Perrys lyrics are his all time best. This is the album to get if you want Jane's Addiction.r, and Perrys lyrics are his all time best.

B000IAZ6W4|4.0|Patrick Watson's voice is so eerily like that of the dearly departed Jeff Buckley....they both share a range and sweetness that overwhelm me at times.  Listen to the passage from around 1:00 to 2:00 minutes on \\"Daydreamer\\" (track 2) and you'll hear what I'm talking about.  My one quibble with Watson is that he sometimes overproduces his songs.  \\"Daydreamer\\" is also a good illustration of that point -- the melody is lovely but Watson chooses to clutter it up with all manner of rather low-end special effects that would have been better kept in his synthesizer's memory.  \\"Luscious Life\\" (track 8) also reminds me slightly of Sufjan Stevens.  I'm hard pressed to detect any influence by Debussy or Satie, no matter what Watson's bio says.    This is a promising effort, and highly recommended.
B000002AH7|5.0|Miles Davis-Sketches Of Spain *****<br /><br />On a personal note, Sketches Of Spain is with out a doubt my all time favorite Miles Davis album. Now I am not saying that it is his best album, I'm just saying that for me personaly it is a favorite.<br /><br />Considered his third straight masterpiece with arranger and conducter Gil Evans, Sketches Of Spain is a jazz album to me unlike anyother, especially in the cannon of Miles Davis. Now many say that Sketches is in the same category as his best, Kind Of Blue, as well as Porgy And Bess, and Miles Ahead. Yes it is in the same category as Kind Of Blue in the sense that this is a masterpiece along side it, but the two albums are nothing alike, which is why the few that don't enjoy Sketches don't enjoy it. As for Porgy And Bess, and Miles Ahead it is only comparable with those because those too were recorded with Gil Evans, but in this reviewers opinion not to the same results.<br /><br />Made up of a backing orchestra completly put together by Gil Evens and conducted to back Miles as he plays the trumpet and fleugolhorn. This sort of contrast makes for an interesting listen all around. It was around 1959 and Miles was introduced to a spanish-classical piece intitled 'Concierto Do Aranjuez' (which appears here as track one) by the composer Rodrigo that he was so inspired by what he called 'the spanish tinge' that he researched everything he could on Gypsys and flemico music; thus inspiring him to record the Sketches album with Evans. Though the original was in guitar Davis transcribed it over into trumpet adding a new flavor to the piece. The last track on the original album, and number five here is 'Solea' which is a Evans piece branching the blues with flaminco, and to sumerise with a word is breathtaking. Between the open and close we have 'Will O The Wisp' which is a classic ballat piece. 'The Pan Piper' which is much along the lines of 'Wisp.' 'Saeta' is a favorite off the album combining jazz moods with spanis tones and tons of latin feel. Davis shines his brightest during 'Saeta' especially toward the end.<br /><br />With the new remaster of Sketches Of Spain are three bonus tracks the first of which being 'Song Of Our Country' which feels more like Sketches of Brazil than Spain but still suits the album nicely as it was recorded during the same sessions but not realeased uintil the early 1980's. Also included is the very first take of 'Concierto De Aranjuez' which upon listening is easy to understand why they chose to rerecord the piece. Finally is analternate ending to the track 'Concierto' which once again not as wonderful as the album version but still a cool piece to experince.<br /><br />Sketches Of Spain is the perfect jazz album for any mood. It is easily among the top five Miles Davis albums of all tilme and in my opinion among the top ten jazz albums ever! This is essential to any Jazz or Davis' collection. Highly, highly reccomendedeel. Davis shines his brightest during 'Saeta' especially toward the end.

B000TNF7OC|4.0|That would stand for 'Identified Rockin' Object.' From the first time I heard 'Lights Out,' I was a UFO fan. I wouldn't say exactly a diehard fan, but they were right up there. After hearing Lights Out, I did a little retro-scouting for the other UFO recordings and Phenomenon was probably the second UFO LP I owned.<br /><br />They had been a very good band - in my estimation - all along. Since my familiarity started with 'Lights out,' there were two components that WERE UFO. Without one or the other, they were good, but only waving at the greatness they could achieve.<br /><br />Original vocalist Phil Mogg is one of those components. His voice and just the way he phrases lyrics very quickly become an inextricable and extremely identifiable feature of UFO without which... Well, I can't imagine that part.<br /><br />The other component wasn't an original member, but I think it was this release where Michael Schenker joined the band and quickly became an immediately recognizable and quite important part of UFO.<br /><br />(That being said, Vinnie Moore ain't no slouch, either, and the new UFO stuff is picking up where the old UFO stuff left off.)<br /><br />Anyway, this is all a roundabout way to get to the main point, which is that Phenomenon is a great recording. All songs are solid, and ANY release featuring the two songs 'Doctor Doctor' and 'Rock Bottom' is destined for greatness!<br /><br />These reissues are a fantastic way for folks who may not have been around during the time of any particular artists' heyday to become quickly innoculated. The 'bonus tracks' generally included are just that - a true bonus. The CD release of Phenomenon is no different in that respect.<br /><br />The only part that surprised me was that there are two bonus tracks here ('Sixteen' and 'Oh My') that were produced by Dave Edmunds. There's another artist who's been around for a while. And for an idea of whether or not he knows what he's doing, just take a listen to 'I Hear You Knockin' from the mid-sixties (I believe) all the way up to \\"I Knew The Bride\\" and a few subsequent quality releases that just don't seem to attract any critical attention despite how deserving they are.<br /><br />Maybe it shouldn't be such a surprise though. The same 'malady' seems to afflict UFO. This release (Phenomenon) will show you exactly why they deserve an expanded spot in your music library, but they've slipped back into semi-obscurity as far as much of the press is concerned.<br /><br />Getting this CD reminded me of how much I like the band, so I checked into them a bit further. I had no idea that not only did they release another CD in September of 2007 (Monkey Puzzle), but they're expected to start touring again in April of 2008.<br /><br />Grab Phenomenon and you'll be checking to see when UFO is coming near enough to you to catch them live. Either of these (buying 'Phenomenon' or catching a live UFO show) will be acts I promise you won't regret.Knew The Bride\\" and a few subsequent quality releases that just don't seem to attract any critical attention despite how deserving they are.

B000001FMX|5.0|New York Dolls *****<br /><br />Easily one of the all time greatest rock n' roll albums and bands, not to mention one of the most influential albums of all time. The New York Dolls came on like culture shock on high. The mixture of raw, raunchy, true-blue rock n' roll and drag was just more then some could take. Concidered by many to be one of the main precurcers of punk along with The Stooges, The MC5, and The Velvet Underground among a few others, and this is not far concidering the attitude, the fast, sharp delivery, JoHansens vocals, and well Johnny Thunders. But when it comes down to it, the Dolls are just a really great rock band and this is their self-titled debut album.<br /><br />The model like David JoHansen handling vocals, the silent Arthur Kane lending some bass, JT soulmate Jerry Nolen on drums, the fantastic showmen that is Sylvain Sylvain on guitar, and of course Johhny Thunders (JT) on lead guitar. With a line up like that you just can not go wrong. The writing team of Thunders and JoHansen brought us such classics as the bands signature 'Personality Crisis' as well as 'Bad Girl,' 'Subway Train' which JT would later redue, and the live favorites 'Private World' and 'Jet Boy.' Sylvain also lent writing credits to such classic as 'Frankenstien' and the anti-smack song 'Trash' which is among the bands best songs. 'Looking For A Kiss' 'Vietnamese Baby' and 'Lonely Planet Boy' were all penned by JoHansen. Plus the one cover 'Pills' which the Dolls made their own. These are the songs that fill up the majority of the bands set list in concert and are the songs that they are known for more then they songs on their second album, Too Much Too Fast, and later with a second lineup.<br /><br />Growing up very much in love with the sounds of sixties girl-groups, especially those produced by the crazy, yet brilliant Phil Speckter and basic three minute don't-bore-us-get-us-to-the-chorus rock n' roll the New York Dolls tried to fuse the two into one and as a result we have one of the most important albums of all time influencing everyone from David Bowie to Sid Vicous to Aerosmith to just about every late 1980's band to come out of L.A. This is very much one of the greatest albums of all time, and is one album that desearves to be in EVERYONES collection.st important albums of all time influencing everyone from David Bowie to Sid Vicous to Aerosmith to just about every late 1980's band to come out of L.A.

0143038419|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and was surprised to see so many uncomplimentary reviews that have been posted. I admire Elizabeth's courage and honesty to tell the world her personal experiences. Throughout the book she lets the reader into her private world.    In each of the 3 sections of the book I felt included in Elizabeth's life.    While Elizabeth was in Italy, I felt her passion for food and empathy for her while she weaned herself off anti depressants (that certainly takes courage in my book). While in India, Elizabeth tells us about how she learned to find balance.  One chapter that stood out for me was when Elizabeth speaks of how when the harder she tried to quiet the voices in her head, the louder they got, and when she finally stopped trying the voices quieted on their own. In Bali, Elizabeth found balance and love. I truly enjoyed this book.    Another book, by renowned authors Ariel & Shya Kane [[ASIN:1888043180 Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment]] also a book I really enjoyed and highly recommend. The book consists of short stories about transformation.

B0001EKZOQ|5.0|Aparte de la calidad de grabacion realmente buena , entre el concierto  en directo y el disco encontre pocas diferencias mas alla de lo obio.    El bolero cubano y la voz flamenca se juntan en este disco y dan lugar  a un disco irrepetible , por la edad de Bebo por una parte y por que sera dificil que se vuelvan a conjuntar estos dos estilos tan dispares de  forma tan acertada .    Altamente recomendado ,no para puristas sin mente abierta
B000Z6MIQS|4.0|I've been a fan of Simple Plan since first hearing their huge hit, \\"I'd Do Anything\\" years ago. I bought their first album and loved it, and then i grew up. I still like the album, but at times it's definitely targeted for a younger generation.     With their second album, \\"Still Not Getting Any...\\" I was highly disappointed. I hoped that Simple Plan would have branched out and created something more amazing with the little bit of talent that they had, but I was met with more whiny teen angst and ridiculous lyrics of how bad the world is.     A few years have gone by and I figured that since I hadn't heard anything new by them, that they had broken up, but then I saw this album had just come out. I figured I'd give it a listen, just to check it out at to my surprise, it didn't sound too bad. With high hopes I bought it, and to my amazement this album is pretty darn good. They finally have grown up with the rest of the world. I really enjoy this album, its good to hear Simple Plan with a fresh twist. I would recommend this CD to anyone for some good ol' pop punk at its best. Give them a chance, they finally figured themselves out.
1594489505|5.0|Khaled Hosseini is officially my new favorite author. If you like The Kite Runner, you will love A Thousand Splendid Suns. Hosseini has such a flowery, poetic grasp of language. I have never read anyone else who injects such emotion into every phrase he writes.    Although there seem to be similar structures and themes in both books, I don't find this to be repeatitive. After all, the themes of love, loss, betrayal, etc. are the most universal. Hosseini's description of Afghanistan has opened my eyes to a country that I never knew much about, aside from the one-dimension image I had from the news. He makes the reader feel part of the rich culture and turbulent politics. I can say that I cried several times throughout the book. The touching family dynamics and heartbreaking circumstances are so touching and all too real. I could not stop reading this book and finished it in two days. It is hard for a book to capture my attention that fast but both of Hosseini's books do that. I highly recommend this book.
B000Q6GUTI|4.0|First off, let me say that this was surprisingly good. I didn't think that it would be considering that Mark Wahlberg is the star, but he has proven himself. With movies like this and The Departed, he will make a name for himself not only as an actor who can utter 'F*ck' like there's no tomorrow, but also as one who can act behind it.    Everyone gives a pretty solid performance throughout, except for Danny Glover and Wahlberg's lady friend. Glover has a lisp so bad that it's almost impossible to understand him. In fact, it is downright annoying. I was glad when he walked off screen, thankful that he didn't play a major role. I mean I know he has braces, as visible in some shots, but he is just hard to understand. If he didn't have the lisp, then there would be no problem. Also, the girl does not seem too intelligent. She is typical and predictable, obviously not one of the film's strong points.     Besides that, the film is very good. Yes, the plot has some spots, making it a unbelievable (especially the whole FBI partner-thing), but then again movies (especially this one) are not supposed to be realistic     Once you get past that, accept it for what it is and nothing more or less.     Verdict: Rent or buy cheap
B0008ENICU|5.0|For almost 60 years, \\"The Women\\" has proven to be a camp classic of high society at its worst.  The claws come out (Jungle Red) and the backbiting never stops. Holywood has seldom given us banter that is this quick or this biting.
B0013FDM7E|4.0|Spoiler Alert!    Will Smith stars in a movie that is worth all the hype. In marketing this movie, they did a good job to show absolutely nothing as to intrigue audiences. Even though this is technically a remake, it stands up by itself as if it wasn't.     The plot is masterfully crafted . The end was somewhat expected, as finding a cure would be only the way to go, but Smith dying was totally unexpected, at least in my opinion.     There is little to gripe about this one. But what needs to be griped about is the insanely bad CG. In this age where every other cartoon movie is CG, to have such horrendous animation is inexcusable. I guess all the budget for the movie went into paying Will Smith.    Another thing people complained about was how Will Smith seemed to act like himself. With Will Smith, this seems to work in almost every movie he stars in. If you see this movie, you will not be disappointed, except by the CG.    Verdict: See this moving, great film now.
B000R7HY0K|1.0|Death Proof all but killed the whole \\"Grindhouse\\" experiment last year. So much so that the Weinsteins were going to split the two movies to try and recover from box office disaster. Rodriguez got it soooo right with \\"Planet Terror\\" and set up QT beautifully, only to strike out. I'm a fan of Quentin T's but he really blew it big time in this one. Even Kurt Russell (his usual goodness here) couldn't save it. I can understand what QT was trying to do with all the boring girlie banter, that just went on, and on, and on, and on. zzzzz. We stayed though and were treated for the most part, finally, to some great raw car/stunt action but it wasn't enough to save this stinker. And now it's an EXTENDED RELEASE, omg don't watch this with any sharp objects nearby. Mercy for the dvd fast forward I suppose, it could save lives here. Every time Rosario Dawson or Tracie Thoms open their mouths hit that ffwd button for a bout 3 minutes and you'll be good to go.     I'm very glad they split up the dvd releases, skip this one and go straight to Planet Terror.
B000W4KT64|4.0|Hairspray is a surprising hit. I didn't think that I would like this movie, but I actually did, very much in fact.     The songs and singing are great, along with the acting and plot etc. There are many \\"hidden\\" innuendoes that many little kids would not get that adults will.     It keeps moving and grooving and has a good sub plot (Hairspray Queen) to make everything flow nicely. The only thing that I didn't particularly like was John Travolta dressed as a woman. That was not only frightening, but hard to look at as well. Either way there wouldn't have been a way to get out of some man looking awful, I'm sure. Thank God him and Christopher Walken did not have a full on kiss anywhere in the movie.    Verdict: Worth a rental or a purchase, depending on how bad you want to see it.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Movies and DVDs are so hard to give a review for because everything is subjective.  I may really enjoy something that the next person can't bring themself to watch.  This being said, I think anyone who enjoys a good action movie will enjoy this series, and at $43 it was impossible for me to pass up.  For me, in my mid-twenties, it really gave me a new perspective on how hard some people did have it during the wars.  There were no choices to join the force, you were drafted and that's the way it was.  And the concentration camps...  They make serving in war and fighting for your freedom seem like something you'd do for fun.  Overall, in my book it is well worth the $40+.  I don't buy many movies that I end up watching multiple times, but I could watch this at least once a year.
0345494997|4.0|I bought this book because it was listed in one of the best books of the year in Amazon, but I don't think it's that good. The true story of what happened with Mamah Cheney and Frank Lloyd Wright is interesting in itself - and I liked that the author wanted to write about Mamah Cheney's point of view: what makes a woman abandon her husband, risking never seeing her children again, not seeing them grow, etc.    It's also interesting to see how a feminist thought at that time, in particular when she went to Europe to find other points of view there. I imagine that even if this book is fiction, it is true to the woman who Mamah Cheney must have been, a woman who fascinated a man like Frank Lloyd Wright.    I like the way it is written, but I don't believe it's a 5 star book, although it was interesting to read.
B000QUCNOU|3.0|I had a very difficult time getting past the arrogance in Robert Graysmith's book (on which this movie was based and named) and was relieved to see the same self-boosting egotistical writing had not been used in the creation of this movie.  Yet, it still had a difficult holding my attention.<br /><br />Viewers of this movie are simply not given enough to become personally attached to the characters or the outcome.  In a movie such as this, you don't want to just see it..you want to FEEL it; and it's absent here from beginning to end.<br /><br />This is one of those movies that I recommend watching when there is nothing else available.  It's okay, but don't expect a masterpiece.
078581325X|5.0|I have been a fan of Sherlock Holmes from the time I was a boy.  I am not alone.  How else could you explain the longevity of a character who was created primarily as a mass entertainment in the Strand Magazine, the Victorian equivalent of a television show.  But, unlike his contemporaries in the Strand, Holmes has gained immortality.  As time passes, he moves in and out of fashion, sometimes newly popular and cool, and at others hopelessly old fashioned and quaint.  But, there's something about that monomaniacal probably bi-polar, self destructive and vain character that keeps him bouncing back.<br />I have many editions of Holmes stories, in print, in film and in television episodes, most remarkably and satisfyingly, the Granada series with Jeremy Brett, but I had to have this one.<br />In most of the collections the one thing that is achingly absent is the series of drawings by Sydney Paget.  In \\"The Original Illustrated Sherlock Holmes,\\" that defect is corrected.<br />\\"Here,\\" the flyleaf proclaims, \\"are the original Sherlock Holmes stories ... as they first appeared in the British Magazine, the Strand.\\"  These are facsimiles of the pages of the magazine, so the layout of the narrative in two columns with illustrations inserted in the text, is exactly as it was a hundred years ago, down to the choice of font.<br />All of the stories are not here.  This is not a \\"Complete Sherlock Holmes.\\"  (That volume, sadly, is out of print and is only available, in limited quantities, at some booksellers.)  However, all of the stories that were published in their own volumes as The Adventures, The Memoirs, and The Return are here, as well as the serialization of The Hound of the Baskervilles.  So, since the stories are available elsewhere, I shall concentrate on the illustrations which are really what make this volume distinctive.<br />Sydney Paget, who along with Sir John Tenniel, pretty much defined Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Century illustration, is the source of much of how we visualize Holmes.  He is the man who created the cape and deerstalker that has come to be most associated with the character. (The calabash pipe was the contribution of stage actor William Gillette.)  In Paget's illustrations we see Holmes expertly portrayed in all his bi-polar glory, from his languid despair over the lack of imagination in crime to the monomaniacal pursuit of a clue once his interest is aroused.  The clients who seek his aid and the villains he threatens are no less clearly drawn.  Paget is meticulous in his presentation of significant detail and, as good illustrations should, match perfectly with the moment in the text when the imaginative \\"snapshot\\" is taken.  He is, perhaps, at his most impressive, though, when the scene calls for darkness, as in the attack by the Hound.  The brilliant highlights surrounded by the subtle grays, with just enough detail to suggest the scene, cast against almost complete darkness, is pure genius.  Paget is a master of light.  As far as I know, this is the only place where the original illustrations and the text appear together and fully justifies its purchase even if, as I have, you possess many other versions of the tales.Holmes.

B0013D8LOU|5.0|This is a brief condensation of all the reviews posted here regarding the film version of \\"SWEENEY\\"...that affect my appreciation of the film.<br />1).  Technically brilliant on ALL levels.<br />2).  On its own, a great film.  As an adaptation of the stage show, sadly lacking, especially in the \\"singing\\" department.<br />3).  Burton creates a strictly dramatic version of the story... Sondheim's wonderful black humor is terribly missed.<br />4).  Although many of the musical cuts added to the film, cutting \\"The Ballad Of Sweeney Todd\\" is very sorely missed- without the chorus, we don't appreciate the horror of Sweeney's bloody deeds effect upon the community.  Also- Christopher Lee and Anthony Stewart Head were SUPPOSED to be part of that chorus... it's inexcusable to not mention in the film's credit that they were dismissed due to Burton's changed take on the script.<br />5).  Bonham's take on \\"Mrs. Lovett\\" is dead-on in context of the film, although a daffier take on her(re: Lanbury's balmy version and LuPone's sexier one) would have lightened things up a bit.<br />6).  With all said, this IS the superlative version of any Sondheim show in films, although I will equally treasure the filmed version of the original Harold Prince staging with the touring company, as well as the San Francisco \\"Concert\\" version(the recent Broadway revival is available as a bootleg, but does not measure up to the previous three).
B0012K1ILW|5.0|When I first read the mixed reviews for New Amerykah, I somewhat had doubts of buying this CD, but when I went to Best Buy and noticed that the New Amerykah CD's were completely sold out and had to re-order another quantity, I knew I had to cop it.  A week later, I picked up the CD and just finished listening to it yesterday and Erykah Badu finally put my doubts to rest and came through with assurance.  New Amerykah is a blast of clean; fresh air that doesn't sound like anything else right now.  This is exactly what music desperately needs right now with an unconventional approach that's deep, yet moves progressively in the right direction and relevant with the times.  With some of the reviews complaining that she's losing direction, one needs to understand that if an artist wants to evolve, they have to challenge the 'status quo' and not become subjectively complacent to the same commercial cookie-cutter formula that the radio is constantly feeding us. Every once in a while, you just have to go against the grain and take that risk to take your creativity to a new dimension.  Fortunately with New Amerykah, it was a risk that was calculatedly wise that paid off brilliantly.  New Amerykah, in my opinion, is her best and most innovative LP to date.  I definitely can't wait for pt 2.

It was better in some ways, and much worse in others.<br /><br />What it lacked in vapid emotionalistic romance, it made up in a heroine who is horribly self-centered, feministic and manipulative, a story in which the heroine doesn't take responsibility for her questionable actions, has a very egocentric morality and behaves reprehensibly, lying to police investigators, luring a mutinous brother to town which causes the death of a man, insulting her apostate father's successor at his vicarage, stringing along an obviously still-smitten former suitor while it suits her needs.<br /><br />Add to this the BBC's relentless socialist touches to the film, sloppy modern additions like the ridiculous kissing scene in the train station, and cardboard characters on par with the later Star Wars movies, and you have a real mess.<br /><br />There's much, much more to dislike.  Don't waste your time.<br /><br />Just wretched.
B000YEUUCK|5.0|I had the privilege of seeing the Celine Dion concert live in December of 2006, and it was an incredible experience! I recently purchased the concert DVD and was amazed with the high quality. It brought back such great memories of the concert itself and is a must for anyone who enjoys great music, whether they saw the original concert or not!
1577314808|5.0|There is only NOW.  This point is made over and over in this book; and it is true each time.  We all need to be reminded to be present, and in the moment, from time-to-time; and this book is a great reminder.  The message of being fully present is compounded in so many different ways, a wide range of readers can relate to what is commonly referred to as \\"esoteric spiritual wisdom\\" -- as opposed to more \\"mainstream\\" ideas about existence.    Critics of this book complain about the absence of practical tools for eliminating fears, worries, and other negative, limiting, or distracting thoughts -- those things Tolle says keeps us out of our NOW.  The book does offer meditations; and, although many people may not be able to learn meditation from a book, it is up to the individual to seek further instruction.  It is not sane to think one small book could answer all your questions and solve all your problems while teaching advanced spiritual practices and skills along with energy psychology techniques to release trauma and negativity...    Critics, however, do shed light on a valid point with all such spiritual works -- they are only part of the story.  It is up to the individual reader to seek out alternatives and techniques for releasing limiting beliefs and thought patterns.  Thanks to books like, \\"Spirituality Simplified,\\" readers can contextualize where a book like \\"The Power of Now\\" fits into their spiritual journey; and thanks to other books like, \\"The Biology of Belief,\\" individuals can see a more practical picture of how being in the moment changes your life, and how to change your thoughts to be more in the moment.  For readers looking for hands-on tools for releasing these problematic thought patterns that keep people frustrated, check out modalities like Grant Connolly's The Z-Point Process for Instant Emotional Healing, or Gary Craig's Emotional Freedom Techniques -- both are amazing ways to eliminate doubt, fear, negativity, etc, so you can spend more time thinking the way Eckhart is recommending you think.    It sounds like a tall order; but I have personally made this shift -- and it is worth it.  The Power of Now may be one of those books you have to read a couple times, or it may be a book you need to read AFTER learning Z-Point or EFT (so you can eliminate problem thoughts...), but you should read this book as \\"one more piece in a very large puzzle.\\"  The more you hear (or read) this message, the better.    I am now on my way to read A New Earth...
B000002VQQ|5.0|I should preface this review by saying that I don't listen to rock anymore, having long since left it for Miles, Mingus, Monk, Coltrane, Coleman, Cecil, and Braxton.  However, there are still some few albums that \\"do it\\" for me, and I think these are among the albums that are definitive of rock'n roll: Hendrix's Are You Experienced?, Dylan's Highway 61 Revisited, The Velvet Underground and Nico, The Stooges' debut, Zappa's Hot Rats, Captain Beefheart's Trout Mask Replica, Joni Mitchell's Blue, Bowie's Ziggy Stardust, The Stones' Exile on Main Street, Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon, The Clash's London Calling, The Sex Pistols' Never Mind the Bullocks, The Violent Femmes' self-titled debut, the Pixies' Doolittle, Alanis Morissette's Jagged Little Pill, Nirvana's Nevermind, and, perhaps above all, Patti Smith's Horses. Smith's lyrics stand with Dylan's, Joni's, Leonard Cohen's, and Bob Marley's as the most influential popular poetry of the twentieth century.  And her music is pretty good, too...
B000FDEUFS|5.0|Man oh man oh man - THIS is the best of the best, the best remaster of the best of The Masters of American Rock/Jazz/Blues ever, The Allman Brothers Band when they were at their peak. The sound engineering on this CD has to be heard to be believed, but take my word for it, it is freaking excellent! Eat A Peach, when I first bought the album as a heartbroken junior in High School, was a great testament to the band and to their fallen leader, the greatest guitarist ever, Duane Allman. Of course the stuff Duane played on was excellent, but what we fans were ultimately saved by were the new recordings they made without him. They were so damn good with Duane, and yet the band was still damn good without him ( or should I say, without Duane's guitar playing, for he was certainly there in spirit when they recorded these songs.). And this superb remastering makes it all sound awesome. AND: added to all this is the second disc which features the entirety of the Brother's performance at the closing of the legendary Fillmore East. The sound quality of this disc is damned good, just a shade less than the original Fillmore recording, but hardly noticeable, I'd say. It's great to hear Duane talking between songs, great to hear his mind-altering guitar playing, great to hear Berry still playing the best bass in the world, and man does Greg sound good here. And of course Dickey Betts is awesome, and Jaimoe and Butch laying down the great double-beat...Jesus Christ! What a band they were! So glad they were with us while they were, but so damn sad Duane and Berry were gone so soon after these recordings. This CD is the best way to remember what was the greatest American rock band ever. Amen!<br />Now here are some more words a couple of months later. I now think that the second disc here sounds BETTER than the original Fillmore show. The mix is absolutely superb. Perhaps Duane and Dickey are playing a little more loosely here than on the Fillmore CD, but the overall sound here is just perfect, especially on headphones. This Deluxe Edition of Eat A Peach would definitely be on my Desert Island list. It has almost everything Fillmore has, plus the great studio songs they recorded just before and just after Duane's tragic death. I cannot recommend this CD enough - absolutely worth every penny. Listen and enjoy, rejoice and cry, it's all here. Duane Allman was a musical genius. And his band was the best this country ever produced. There's never been anything like him, or them, since.t perfect, especially on headphones. This Deluxe Edition of Eat A Peach would definitely be on my Desert Island list.

B00111L0MY|4.0|We almost turned this off after the first 30 minutes of one nasty word after another but the story was interesting so we kept watching to the end.  Makes you talk about the ending and figure out what you would've done.
B000QUCNOK|1.0|I hated the movie.  It was just too freaky.  The baby was oh so sweet and I wanted to hold the poor, little unwanted thing.  But that was the only part of the movie that moved me.  The rest of it was so ridiculous, that I was ashamed that I rented it or even spent the time watching it.  I like period films but this was just inane.  My opinion, of course. If you want to waste a couple hours of your life like I did and regret it, go ahead and spend the money. But take my advice and pass on this one.  It is just tooooo stupid.

0345406680|5.0|I was standing in a college bookstore and saw this title as the text for a class on Asian history. I typically have no interest in this genre but this book was riveting. The detail and genuine quality of the author's words are unique. One expects a POW who was tortured to seek out the torturer for revenge not forgiveness. This story has a beautiful, eternal message to the rest of us who hold grudges over much smaller offenses.
0321544080|4.0|Before ordering this book I had seen JoeMcNally give a foreword in a video; Didn't think much of him from that.     This book opened a whole new perspective to JoeMcNally and more importantly, photography. He really really knows his stuff. The book has nice photos and the whole book rides on a concept where he lets you have a piece of his mind, like kind of explaining what led to a shot.     It really doesn't go much into the stuff of what aperture or shutterspeed and whatnot.   What the book is really about, is about learning to think, and see perspective to things. And in that, it's absolutely wonderful! The book is full of insightful advice and know-how. Good stuff.

0375707972|5.0|I read this book years ago [prior to Oprah's endorsement].  Five stars are not enough for this well written, engaging story that stays with the reader for years & years.  In many ways, this is a morality tale; however, it is also so much more.  Schlink provides a thought-provoking evocation of one of history's darkest times.  Everyone I've given to this has had only positive things to say.  Recommended without hesitation!!

That changed the entire documentary thank you bbc for putting out a resounding piece of art for cultural awareness and new art media (high definition).

B000ICLRIE|4.0|This movie is an exuberant epic uunparalelled in it's year when it didn't recieve any critical acclaim or rewards but pish posh what do they know, this movie is fantastic! Watching it through a couple times makes me like it even more a great adition to any blu ray library that captures the essence of a profound theatrical experience, with amazing costume, set design, and stunning but ultra realistic visuals, the only surreal thing about this film (on blu ray at least) is the vibrant colors! super duper viually pleasing not very realistic but very entertaining, we watch movie for enterainment not reality, unless its a documentary!
B000XUOIQ4|5.0|Nostalgic artists' views of pre-WWI Paris and the French countryside are the backdrop for this sweet Disney classic.  The colors and crispness of image on this DVD are truly amazing.  I would love to see this movie on Blu-Ray. It is hard to imagine this film looked much better in the theater.  The story is the tried and true Disney formula of separation and struggle to be reunited.  Innocent enough for the youngest kids, this movie has plenty to offer their parents.  It is a shame there aren't six stars for a film like this.  The DVD also lets you isolate the songs and skip everything else.  It's like buying a separate soundtrack disc but with full animation.  I'd like to see this feature on ALL musical movie DVD's.
B000OCY7JE|5.0|It would be a shame to spill the story of this movie! Other reviewers have callously done so; don't read them! The artistic triumph of After The Wedding is the slow revelation of plausibility and motivation where at first there seems to be only implausible coincidence and random behavior.<br /><br />It's a sad movie with scenes of genuine love. If you automatically find sadness just a synonym for depression, you won't like it. Is it a melodrama? Perhaps, but it probes far deeper into the emotional cores of its four main characters than any melodrama I've seen since Bergman.<br /><br />Is it a pleasure to watch? I found it so, chiefly for the riveting performances of the actors, especially Rolf Lassgard as Jorgen, whose actions are pivotal in the lives of the others. The cinematography is also truly skillful; each visual has emotional weight. Mainly, I confess, my pleasure came from watching virtuosic acting and directing for a rare change, rather than from the content of the film.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|I never grow tired of hearing this soundtrack!..the music is extremely enjoyable even if you have never seen the movie(which i strongly recommend also!)Being a Beatles fan, I am always skeptical about remakes of their songs but these are not attempted sound alikes..they are done in the spirit of the artist singing and tell a story..A must to have for anyone's collection
B000OCXFCO|5.0|...I take that back. Megadeth hasn't mellowed out that much. the arrival of the Drover brothers put more fuel in its fire, so MD has more intensity. my favorite song off this album is \\"A Tout Le Monde\\" which he sings with Cristina Scabbia of Lacuna Coil. this is the first time that Dave ever sang with someone. the afforementioned song is also on their 1994 album Youthanasia. rock on Megadeth!
B000000JO3|5.0|What can I say about this album that has not already been said?  If you love music or even simply have a fascination with culture and society, this album is a landmark in its century.  Many albums can be remembered for creating a genre, or for catapulting a social movement, or for coining a subculture, or for inspiring so many others, but not many albums can be credited for doing all of these things and more.  Minor Threat - Complete Discography is one of those albums.  This album changed my life.  The lyrics are angry, but not negative and they are positive, but not happy.  All of the songs are short, fast, and hit you like a ton of bricks.  The lyrics deal with straight-edge ideals, friendships, loyalty, and social issues.  If you are new to this kind of music (80's hardcore) and are looking at this album as a sort of stepping-stone into the genre, let me give you some advice.  These songs were recorded and produced by a group of poor musicians from between 1981-1985.  If you are not used to this, you can be distracted by the poor sound quality.  As are most great things, this era of hardcore is a very acquired taste.  Listen to the songs, read the lyrics, and research the culture.  If you are new to hardcore, don't get caught up in hearing every band that every old-timer says is the best.  Listen to this album.  This is THE album for 80's DC hardcore, THE album for straight-edge lifestyle, THE album for hardcore inspirations today.  If you need to know one thing about hardcore, know Minor Threat.
B0013ND30M|5.0|In 1959, the New York Times called Sleeping Beauty \\"a crisply stylized fairyland where the colors are rich [and] the sounds are luscious.\\" In his book [[ASIN:0786881372 The Disney Films]], critic Leonard Maltin writes that Sleeping Beauty is \\"a very good film, but more so for older audiences than for young children.\\" [[ASIN:0664225918 The Gospel According to Disney]] says the movie illustrates \\"an eternal promise of resurrection,\\" while [[ASIN:0292702736 From Walt to Woodstock]] claims it is a \\"therapeutic experience\\" that celebrates \\"a male-female relationship based on true equality.\\"<br /><br />As for me, I'd say that regardless of what you read into it, Sleeping Beauty is a must-own. A true Disney classic, the movie has such stunning visuals and such a strong villain that it makes up for its one major flaw: the lack of a good lead character.<br /><br />The art, for example, is astounding. Full of bright 1950s color, each background is a graphic collage of rectangles and straight lines that is filled to the edges with meticulously sharp detail.

0385338724|3.0|I'm a HUGE fan of Sophie Kinsella's books. I've read every single one and each of them I've loved. I was a bit disappointed in this latest release. There wasnt many laugh out loud moments and I just didnt enjoy any of the characters as much as her previous books. Hopefully Kinsella's next book will be more along the lines of her previous books.

B000ZK4466|5.0|so i've been a TMV fan since De-Loused, i hadn't heard the band until i was dragged, kicking and screaming, to the concert in 2004. and i fell in freaking love. De-Loused and then Frances grabbed me, haunted me, gave me nightmares, made me cry (and still do). Amputechture...didn't. so ok, let's fast forward to Bedlam. TMV is one of very few bands that will have me running to scoop up the latest on my lunch hour the day of release. no different for Bedlam. i couldn't get it in my player fast enough. and wow, i was not disappointed. while i haven't fleshed out the backstory as of yet (i know the general idea, but i'm not really feeling it like i do with De-Loused and Frances), the musicianship is amazing. Cedric...the wailing, screaming, the force and distortion ('does it make you feel alright?' heck yeah!). scary stuff, love it. he reminds me of early Kate Bush, just totally unabashed and free. Omar...Omar is amazing, and i'm not a guitar riff/solo/show-off kinda gal. he's inventive, creative AND can pull it all off without being annoying or flashy. i never thought Jon Theodore could be topped on drums but Pridgens is incredible, i can't believe some of the stuff he pulls off. the real test is when i see him live, whether he beats out my beloved J.T. (who i adored from first sight when he wore his F*** Bush t-shirt). Juan Alderete is radical on bass. Ikey is insane on Goliath. i won't critique song-by-song, others here have done a fine job, but my faves are...geez i love them all, save #6. but i skip The Widow on Frances too so i guess slow melodic TMV isn't my thing. so thanks for reading, i urge all music lovers to check out one of the most talented, emotional and interesting bands i've yet to come across.
B001041JLE|5.0|THRILLER 25TH ANNIVERSARY DELUXE EDITION IS SIMPLY AWESOME!!!!!    I just can't stop playing THRILLER 25..Did you all see the 2006 World Music Awards, where the GUINNESS BOOK OF RECORDS awarded Michael Jackson an award for selling at that time over 104 million copies of THRILLER worldwide? Now, that is a record that is simply amazing. Congratulations, MJ. We your fans miss you terribly, MJ. Please come back to the stage real soon. I haven't been to a live show since your live show and am anxiously awaiting your return, MJ. The imitators and perpetrators are simply BORING me to tears. GREATEST ENTERTAINER EVER!!!!!
B00008RH3L|4.0|As for the story, we have a rather intricate one here involving a man by the name of Tom, played brilliantly by the Irish actor Gabriel Byrne, who jumps with his loyalty between two of the biggest crime bosses in the city.  Tom is dissected with each scene, and for this we are excited to see who Tom will really become at the end of the movie.  There were great shoot-out scenes in the movie, particularly when Albert Finney's character takes on a whole group with one single Tommy gun.  Taking place during Prohibition, this movie comes alive with corrupt Irish police, mayors shifting allegiance to crime bosses, speakeasies springing up left and right, and blood; blood spilling, blood pouring, and head shots in view of the camera.  This was the Coen Brothers' third movie and the third and final movie in which Barry Sonnenfeld worked as the cinematographer. As Sonnenfeld says in a special feature on the DVD, this is a handsome movie.  The shots are long and artfully paced. The colors are dark and smooth. For lover's of cinematography: the hats, trees, long shots, vomit color, and police clothing are sure to please.

B000GIXEIG|3.0|I thought this was a pretty good telling of the Beowulf story, but it's not a story I care much for, anyway.  Both Grendel the troll and Gerard Butler as Beowulf display sufficient beef to satisfy viewers who are interested in that sort of thing, as I am.      I really liked Sarah Polley's film \\"Away From Her\\", but I wasn't familiar with her as an actress, so I was eager to see her in this.  I had a hard time enjoying her performance,though, just because her accent (I thought it sounded Midwest, but I guess it's Canadian) seemed so incredibly out of place in the  story.  Couple that with Butler's hard Scots accent and Grendel's unintellible grunting and braying, and you have a really incoherent linguistic hodge-podge.  I kept waiting for a Dane from Brooklyn to chime in, but alas, it didn't happen.

0385338724|4.0|I am a huge fan of Sophie Kinsella, and while the Shopaholic series still remains high on my list of favorite \\"chic lit\\" books, I find the books where Sophie departs from Becky Bloomwood to be thoroughly enjoyable. Waking up in a hospital bed, as a virtual stranger to even to yourself and not knowing what happened during the last three years of your life, is enough to push anyone over the edge. I often wonder how much stress a person must endure to send them into a state of amnesia, and perhaps it is Lexi's work, and her loveless marriage that subconsciously makes her want to forget those three years...regardless, the book provides great insight into how quickly life can change, and the paths that each of us take to get from point A to point B. Despite everything, Lexi eventually found her way and was a much better person for it, in the end.
B00005JNQS|5.0|This is such a neat movie for kids and adults alike.  Very clever, well written and moves quickly as to not bore young ones. Robin Williams as Fender steals the show, but all the characters are very likeable and teaches a good lesson about self-image.

B000CNFC76|5.0|This is an uncomplicated and pleasant movie that gives you a little bit of everything: Comedy, drama, class clash, romance, father/son struggle and a feel good ending.  The acting was perfect by all, especially the kid caddy who deserves an oscar for his comical and endearing performance. He had us laughing out loud everytime he opened his mouth.    Great for kids too - there is no gratuitous sex, violence or langauge.     Even if  golf isn't your \\"thing\\" (it's certainly not mine!), I think you will enjoy this emminantly likeable movie.
B000ZOXDFA|4.0|Although I liked the first Elizabeth better than this sequel, it is still a great flick for fans of period pieces, Cate Blanchett and all things British. Elizbeth's want as a woman and duty as a Queen is evident throughout this story. As she pushes Bess towards Sir Walter, she flashbacks to her own lost youth. I was surpised to learn that Sir Walter Raleigh was indeed, secretly married to one of her ladies-in-waiting. I do think however, much liberty was taken in the telling of this 'romantic' tale. The costumes are amazing, the story entertaining and acting first rate. England never looked better than when those Spanish ships were sinking and Liz was on the hill looking like the mighty warrior.
B0010X8NF0|5.0|I am especially communicating to those who have seen Wes Anderson's movies but haven't seen this yet.    I am a big fan of Wes Anderson's movies, and I think The Life Aquatic is his best.  My favorite things about his movies are the way they look (in both the technical and artistic sense), and the understated lack of normalcy of the way the characters talk.  On the weirdness rainbow, it's more mature than quirkiness, and milder than eccentricity.  Also, everything is deliberate, so there isn't that \\"improv\\" vibe at all.    If I had never seen this movie, and I was dropped in a seat in front of a screen with this on it without me knowing what it was, I'd figure out it was a Wes Anderson film as soon as Adrien Brody was running for the train in slow motion to some song from the 60s or 70s.  That is a compliment.    Wes Anderson has the best formula around, so I think he'd be an idiot to mess with it.  All his tricks and gimmicks, and many actors from his previous movies can be found in here.  I get enough variety from all the movies made by everyone else, so when I see a Wes Anderson movie, I want to see a Wes Anderson movie.
0765316889|4.0|(Note: Spoilers for the previous book.)    After \\"Mistborn: The Final Empire\\" left the prototypical Dark Lord dead and the heroes triumphant, \\"The Well of Ascension\\" starts with, well, \\"What's Next?\\"  The overarching plot of the middle book of the Mistborn trilogy is the attempt by Elend (now King) and the other heroes to maintain power in the face of old nobility and their armies.  This is largely ignored territory for Epic Fantasy, and it's handled well here, although the slow pace of siege warfare makes plotting it trickier.    Sanderson builds heavily on the foundation he established already; the Feruchemy of the Terrismen Keepers, such as Sazed, is further developed, and another allomatic metal is added.  The biggest improvement here is the better development of the supporting cast; while not everyone was fully developed it was much more balanced than the first book.  Elend, Vin, Sazed, and newcomer Zane get more screen time, and are fascinating.  The fight scenes return and Sanderson manages to keep the variety up, although Allomancy now looks to have a large number of unknown metals.    There are a few missteps, however.  Much like with Alendl's diaries in the first book, notes from the philosopher Kwaan are placed above the chapter headings and in the book proper.  Again, they're used to foreshadow a subtle but crucial plot point; however, they are somewhat overused in the attempt, becoming annoying rather than mysterious. A certain use of Allomancy - one that is key to the plot - is poorly explained, and there are a few too many questions at the end.    Still, it's fairly clear that the questions will be answered, even if this book doesn't end as cleanly as the last.  Sanderson handles the issues that arise out of being the middle book of a trilogy better than most in a book that covers mostly new fantasy ground.  Anyone that liked \\"Mistborn: The Final Empire\\" should definitely stay with the trilogy.
B00102F5WK|5.0|This is an excellent movie for 2007 films.  And I kept wondering why it wasn't even mentioned during the Academy Awards.  Roger Ebert gave it full four stars.  This movie is excellent in that it is relevent to today's issue about torture, terrorism, and covert agencies, with wonderful actors all around.  Very good thriller, with intelligence.
B000002H97|5.0|I was so excited when this finally arrived in the mail. I'm a big fan of Metallica and always wanted their \\"epic\\" Black Album. I look forward to adding more Metallica to my collection and I think they are incredible. I love this CD. It is intense and awesome from start to finish. It is Metallica in their prime. The riffs and songs are amazing. Since I purchased their 1991 Black Album, I have listened to it everyday. I can't get enough and it has become one of my favorite Rock albums in my collection. I recommend this album to any true rock/metal fan. It is an instant classic. Songs like \\"Wherever I May Roam\\", \\"Sad But True\\", \\"The God That Failed\\", and \\"Enter Sandman\\" are among my favorite tracks. I had heard a lot about this album over the years and now I see what all the talk was about. This album represented a change for Metallica. They hooked up with producer Bob Rock and altered their sound. I could see how die-hard Metallica traditional fans would hate this album. The guys of Metallica definitely slowed down their playing on this album and I feel that it was a great change. When this 1991 album came out and sold over 10 million copies, Metallica ruled the world. Every single song on the Black Album is incredible. I pretty much wore this album out when I first got it and I will probably continue to do so.

B00006V9A0|5.0|I was so happy to purchase Nirvana's self-titled Greatest Hits album. What can you say about this awesome band that hasn't already been said? From the time period of 1989 to 1994, Nirvana were on top of the world. Nirvana lead the grunge movement of the early 90's that included bands like Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and Alice In Chains. Nirvana's impact on music cannot be denied. Despite the tragic suicide death of Kurt Cobain, their music still lives on to this day. The trio that also includes Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl & Krist Novaselic had so many great songs. Classics like \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\", \\"Come As You Are\\", \\"In Bloom\\", \\"All Apologies\\", \\"About A Girl\\", \\"Lithium\\" and \\"Rape Me\\" can all be found on this Greatest Hits collection. I definitely recommend this purchase for any rock music fan that wants to get caught up on Nirvana.
B00005B5L4|5.0|One of their best albums remastered by Mick Fleetwood...I heard things on this that I had never heard before and it sounded sweeter on my Home Theater/Multi Channel (5.1 Klipsch Heritage) \\"stereo.\\"...No Movie or Video on this one just nice music perfectly recorded.
B0011HF6GE|5.0|Bon Iver's debut really growed on me. It's become the only thing I want to listen to, because after repeated listens there's more and more depth revealed. His voice is a higher-pitched falsetto, which sounds unique coupled with the indie/folk instrumentation. It's guitar-based, but it's not boring; he uses some orchestral backings and subtle electronic additions/manipulations, but first listen invariably yields the response, \\"that's beautiful.\\" Perhaps the most striking aspect of this album is the emotion in his voice, especially in \\"Skinny Love\\" and \\"For Emma, Forever Ago,\\" ranging from frustration to sadness to acceptance and hope. This is an uneniably raw, empassioned work by this exceptional songwriter. None of the songs sound the same, and although it's quite short, it begs to be played again. I give it my highest recommendation; a singer-songwriter with real un-commercialized talent.
0679809015|5.0|My 13 month old son LOVES this book.  It is small - just right for his little hands.  He brings it to me wanting me to read it with him all the time and often indicates that he wants me to read it *again* right after we finish!  He loves opening the flaps on cue and then closing them again once I read what animal is inside.  He is not always gentle with the flaps, but the book is holding up well.  This kid has a LOT of books and this is definitely his favorite right now.

She wakes up and vows revenge.  The movie is all about her revenge and how she gets it.<br /><br />Warning gobs and gobs of blood.<br /><br />Not something I'd let small children see, in fact I don't believe I'd let children of any age see it.<br /><br />If you enjoy Quentin Tarantino you'll enjoy this movie.

B00104QSOM|4.0|It's interesting to note that of the five films Paul Thomas Anderson has written and directed in the past 10 years, \\"There Will Be Blood\\" is his most famous and his most lucritive - pulling in a modest yet impressive 38 million dollars at the box office. His last \\"hit\\" was \\"Boogie Nights\\" (26 million dollars). It's quite an accomplishment.     Still, it must be said that though I thought \\"There Will Be Blood\\" was an excellent film, easily the best of 2007, it's not at all one of Anderson's better films. Leave that for the far superior \\"Magnolia\\" and \\"Boogie Nights\\". Even \\"Hard Eight\\" and \\"Punch Drunk Love\\" surpass \\"Blood\\", at least in character study. Still, even with that said, \\"There Will Be Blood\\" is really good- bloody good.    However, you've got to give Anderson some credit-and a hell of a lot- for such a departure. He leaves his familiar and beloved San Frenardo Valley setting in the dust for . . . dust and dry deserts; the old west. His elaborate ensemble mosaics are a thing of the past. Instead, his story is a period piece shot in the past (the late 1800s). Besides the masterful direction, there's nothing to even indicate that Anderson had anything to do with this film! It's so wonderful to see such a talented director actually stretch his talent and leave his comfort zone to see what he/she's capable of. He succeeds admirably.    \\"There Will Be Blood\\" is a carefully thought out idea from using Upton Sinclair's novel, \\"Oil\\", as inspiration to recruiting Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood to score the music, which I must say would have won for Best Original Score had it not been for the Academy's silly rules for selecting its nominees. *Speaking of the Academy's rules, there should be a rule that the nominees in the Best Director catagory should in fact be a director (singular) not directors (plural)! But that's a whole other story.*    Anyway, \\"Blood\\" boasts exciting preformances from both Day-Lewis and Dano (who also should have at least been nominated-at least!). The cinemaphotography is stunning. The story of greed and corruption is timeless. The ending is nothing but satisfying. Those who are already fans of Anderson will have no problem enjoying this. Those who aren't familiar with his work are presented with an open door inviting them to explore his other films. Either way, \\"There Will Be Blood\\" is a great film from a great director that will one day have his shot at Oscar glory. Let's just hope it doesn't take as long as it did with Scorsese!
B00005JMUA|2.0|Kill Bill Number 2 DVD<br /><br />Kill Bill Number 2 is a continuation of Kill Bill Number 1, of course, this time Uma Thurman finishes her revenge.

B000RO9PXC|4.0|Not one, but two more complete, uncut Doors shows recorded for Absolutely Live, both of these from Boston, 1970.<br /><br />As has been noted by everyone, Morrison is clearly drunk for the performances.  This is a grittier show, with all the good and bad the band was apparently capable of.  The music is excellent as the band carries the singer through most of this.  It's unpredictable, it's not always pretty, but it's definitely a welcome release from a band that keeps re-releasing their studio albums.  And despite the famously inebriated singer, there are many excellent moments here as years of live performance experience propel the band forward.<br /><br />Unlike the older Doors live releases (Absolutely Live, In Concert), this one has no overdubs, and is from single sources, uncut and unfudged.  Once again, Doors engineer Bruce Botnick is responsible for the mixing here.  Some funny moments, too, such as when the Boston house management shuts down the power, effectively ending the show, with Morrison warbling \\"Hey!  Hey!\\", and the crowd booing.<br /><br />Very nice package, three discs, liner notes, nice photos, and original poster art.  The recently released Pittsburgh 1970 disc is a better overall show, with a sharp Morrison.  This is definitely recommended for diehards and completists.  More casual fans may want to pick up one of the other excellent Bright Midnight releases (Detroit, either Aquarius package, Philly, or Pittsburgh).
B0011NVC9I|3.0|I was wondering while I was watching Beowulf, if they had to make the characters look human and the animation so realistic, wouldn't it have been wiser to make it a real film and not an animation.First, this is no kids film.. its an out and out R film. So why the animation. If Lord of the rings can pull of such magnificent imagery in a real movies I fail to see reason why Beowulf couldn't have. The story is of the old english epic Beowulf and his adventures. Though I don't recollect Beowulf having an affair with Grendel's mother but I think it was put in to put the spotlight on Angelina Jolie (playing Grendel's mother).. Of course Grendel the monster looked underfed, oozing with gooey stuff... and the battle did not etch any lasting memory. Somehow the film in my mind ended up being more of an Angelina Jolie playing the seductress and the focus being shifted from the real protagonist. And also I think the directors took too much license when they got a son thrown in as a result of a successful seduction of Beowulf by Grendel's mother (in reality Grendel's mother gets killed). The film missed its point and failed to register and became just a pop-corn flick to be watched in imax.
B0011U8NZ2|5.0|Another Doors show recorded for the Absolutely Live album makes its appearance from Bright Midnight Records, once again uncut and complete.  (Actually, Doors engineer Bruce Botnick notes in the liner notes that a couple of snippets are forever gone, so a portion of Light My Fire has been inserted from the Philadelphia '70 show, as well as another short piece).<br /><br />Shorter than the previously released shows, this is nonetheless excellent.  Unlike the recently released Boston 1970 3-CD set, Morrison is completely with it here, and the band is spot on.  The singer becomes more talkative as the show goes on, and the set list is fantastic, a true gem for any Doors fan.  This is the first and by far the best recording of the ultra-rare Someday Soon.  (The other version, recorded in Seattle weeks later, pales in comparison with a drunk and distant Morrison).  This version has appeared before on the bootleg boxset Stages, though it was incorrectly labeled Baltimore, 1970.<br /><br />Highly recommended for fans new and old.  The liner notes and packaging are very nice, in keeping with the fresh job done for the Boston shows.  Looks like the bulk of the material recorded for Absolutely Live has been released, with Detroit, Philly, Boston, two Aquarius double-disc sets, and some (but not all) of the Felt Forum material having already appeared over the last decade.  A complete set of those four Felt Forum shows are ripe for proper release.<br /><br />Apparently, no overdubs on this one, either.  Just the original tapes, remastered by Botnick, who continues to be involved with every Doors release.  Skip the 50th greatest hits package they've put out, and get this instead.  Much credit to the band for releasing these shows.  Though they still release far too many redundant packages of the studio albums, they finally got to the vaults for the material fans have been asking about for decades.  Easily one of their best live albums.
B0013FXWU6|4.0|\\"There Will Be Blood\\" - Paul Thomas Anderson's ambitious adaptation of Upton Sinclair's 1927 novel, \\"Oil\\" - runs for a good fifteen minutes before a single word is ever spoken.  Yet, that prolonged reticence is probably the least peculiar aspect of a movie that becomes progressively more bizarre the longer it goes on.<br /><br />In the role that won him an Oscar, Daniel Day-Lewis - who, with his stentorian tones, sounds as if he's channeling John Huston for large portions of the film - plays Daniel Plainview, an ambitious oil man in turn-of-the-century California who, in his ruthless quest for money and success, finds he has no room left over in his heart for either God or his fellow man.  Plainview's main antagonist is Eli Sunday, a fire-and-brimstone faith-healer who turns out to be every bit as opportunistic and empty-souled as the godless Plainview (and considerably more hypocritical).<br /><br />With two such unsavory and unsympathetic lead characters, Anderson really didn't have much choice but to go for the abstract in his approach, turning Sinclair's tale into an exercise in art house style that is as liable to alienate \\"general audience\\" viewers as pull them in.  Anderson is dealing with some mighty resonant themes here - greed, deception, abandonment, religion, filial relationships, Man's place in the universe - and he brings an appropriately \\"grand opera\\" sensibility to the film.  He lets Day-Lewis swing for the fences in his performance, resulting in a mesmerizing admixture of over-the-top histrionics and soul-searing subtlety.  Anderson has mounted the film in such a way as to make the visuals and the landscape as integral to the storyline as the characters - at times even more so, as the script frequently fails to sufficiently clarify the motives for why the characters do what they do.  Their actions often feel so arbitrary and inexplicable that we begin to wonder if crucial portions of the film might not have actually ended up on the cutting-room floor.  This is particularly the case in the later stretches of the movie as Plainview descends ever more into paranoia and madness.<br /><br />Paul Dano (\\"Little Miss Sunshine\\") and Dillon Freasier are both excellent as the callow preacher and Plainview's young son, H.W., respectively; and Robert Elswit's award-winning cinematography evokes the beauty of the setting without ever downplaying its bleakness.  Finally, Jonny Greenwood's haunting score nicely underlines the purple-prose nature of the piece.<br /><br />Alternately visionary and pretentious, \\"There Will Be Blood\\" may not be for all tastes and audience demographics, but its uniqueness, daring and style remind us of why many of us enjoy going to the movies in the first place.particularly the case in the later stretches of the movie as Plainview descends ever more into paranoia and madness.

B000ETRCMQ|5.0|I was taken by surprise about how good this movie turned out to be. There was a lot of buzz about Felicity Huffman's performance, and certainly a lot should be said about her poignant portrayal. Without Huffman there wouldn't be a movie; however, the script is amazing too. There are twists and turns to the plot, and just when you think the characters have hit their lowest point, they manage to do something even more heartbreaking. This movie is an experience to be partaken. And maybe, in the process of watching this film, we all learn something about each other and those around us.
B000YABYLA|5.0|What a fantastic movie.  Some points:  * One of the most entertaining, unusual and fantastic Soundtracks I have     heard ....Since Kill Bill. Music tells the story and is great.    * The true strength of the movie is its writing. Just out of this world     dialog between those wonderful actors. The dialog is so quick witted,     sharp, adult, pointed, funny, precise and economical. What a pleasure     to hear some hear the language used well and dialog that is so natural     with the words just flowing.    * Thank the lord we have found a movie that captures teens who are not     boring, boorish, empty headed, who mature, who are intelligent and have    something to say.    * The photography was absolutely first rate and was part of the great       \\"rhythm\\" of the movie that is consistent with the dialog, acting and     soundtrack.    *  Given all I discussed, what a pleasure to have such wonderful ACTORS      with a capital \\"A\\", delivering some much great dialog. Plenty of      substance in each role, given by actors of substance. There are no      words to describe the performance of the Ellen Page. She spoke with     her voice, but also with her wonderfully expressive eyes and facial     gestures. Marvelous performance, as they all were.     I did have a soft spot for the actor who played the Dad. As a Dad to      three boys, two in their 20s, one 12, I really felt for him and was so     \\"proud\\" of him as well. So low key.        *It didn't take me long to forget the other time I have seen him,         in HBOs \\"OZ\\", where he played one of the most unforgettable,      frightening, charismatic, white supremacist in a prison. When I first     saw him I said to myself immediately, \\"Its the Nazi !!\\". That was      forgotten about in about 2 seconds as his performance as Juno's Dad      flowed through. For those who saw \\"OZ\\" as a regular basis, it is no      easy task to get through the stereotype of how powerful his character     was in OZ.    Jon

0143037757|4.0|I won't add my opinion to the cacophony of voices on either side of the Tony Judt issue. I actually think that there are some accurate viewpoints expressed in the 5 star reviews as well as in the 1 star ones. I would only like to point out to future readers that, if they are expecting a history of Europe since 1945, as the subtitle promises, they will be disappointed.     Like many anglocentric historians, Judt seems to think that Europe consists of England, France and Germany, with a little bit of Russia thrown in whenever the Russians are making trouble for the former three. Why else, in a 800+ page book, could he spare only a very few pages on Spain, Portugal and Greece? His explanation that they are on the \\"fringes\\" of Europe does not seem to apply to Italy, also a Mediterranean country separated from the rest of Europe by mountains.     O.K., Spain and Portugal were living in their own world for much of this period, with little interaction with the rest of Europe. But does that mean that their history should be ignored, especially since their isolation was largely imposed by the rest of Europe and the US as punishment for their reluctance to take part in the rest of Europe's mass insanity during WWII? And do not Spain's and Portugal's transition to democracy deserve a more careful analysis, especially since it was accomplished without the destruction that Germany delivered to it's neighbors in making the same journey? Apparently Jundt thinks not.

First, it has a unique prologue introduction to the cult phenomenon in a Mini-Documentary style around 5 minutes unavailable on any other commercial relase of this movie. Secondly, this features a new stereo remix (Chase Surround) of the orinial audio (frankly, I like this better than the new 5.1 remix on the DVD) and untouched color picture giving the film a unique campy look.<br />This anniversary video also contains a music video of 'The Time Warp'<br />taped at an actual showing of the film complete with Audience Participation which you can't find on any other release of this film as well.<br /><br />Another special detail about this anniversay video is the VHS tape. It's tape head and pin rolls are Red and the outer tape canister is Black giving it a unique style similar to the RHPS logo on the box.<br />Unopened copies contain an application to the RHPS fan club.<br /><br />Great for collectors, hard-core fans, or avid VHS users who won't swtich to DVD as this video has now been vailable on DVD since 2000.

B000ZLFALI|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater and knew I had to own it.  I only have a small handful of movies and now this one of them.  I think Julie Taymor is very creative - the way the Beatles songs and production numbers are incorporated into the story; the interpretation of many songs are quite different from my interpretation of over 40 years.  Using \\"I Want You\\"  and the Uncle Sam poster and army initiation was perfect. A condensed slice of history presented in a beautiful manner that spoke to me.  I have loaned the DVD to my son, 24, who also enjoyed it very much.
B000H7J9S0|4.0|A few days ago I finally decided to get a new TV. I went for a 1080p LCD and a Blu-Ray player to go with it, and as soon as I got these I wanted to get a movie to try out the 1080p definition.  This film seemed like a good choice, since I thought that the colors and characters of a fantastic story would allow the player to showcase its qualities. I really did not expect the plot to be all that great, but that was not what I was interested in at the time.<br /><br />The quality of the image was absolutely breathtaking, and superior to a couple of other Blu-Ray movies I have watched afterwards. But what was even more surprising was that the story was actually pretty good. The film immerses us in a town in the Germany of the early nineteenth century. But this is a fictional Germany, which is occupied by France, and in which we find a town next to an enchanted forest. The brothers Grimm are con artists that go from village to village feeding people's fears and charging them for eliminating the evil spirits. Running into the real thing is a rude awakening.<br /><br />If you enjoy fairy tales, this movie will keep you entertained throughout its duration, with an amusing story, satiric elements connected to famous fairy tales, and beautiful scenery. The performances of Damon and Ledger are actually pretty good. Even though it is hard to play roles that are a little \\"silly\\", these actors do a decent job at it. That is not the case with Peter Stormare, who plays the role of Cavaldi, an evil torturer who has a change of heart after meeting the brothers. Stormare is absolutely outstanding in his role, and leaves a long lasting impression.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie to adults that enjoy fairy tales. But beware; this is not a movie to watch with your small children, mainly because in the same vein as the actual stories from the Grimm brothers, there are some scenes that may be too scary for little ones.
B00005JPNY|2.0|The filmmakers tried to make 1) an original and fresh Harry Potter size franchise for the studio, 2) a film that wouldn't offend religious viewers, 3) a film that would still promote the author's atheist/anti-church agenda.    1) Fail  2) Fail  3) Fail    The result was a watered down story that appealed to no one.

And, perhaps to me the strangest decision of all -- probably in an effort to succeed at number two (see above) -- they didn't include the amazingly powerful closing scene of the book.    Highlight of the film for me? Sam Elliott as Lee Scoresby. Perfect casting.    Stardust was the better film. Wish it had had Golden Compass' marketing budget.    Pass on this one.
B000ZLFALS|5.0|I was never the Beatles fan that others have been - especially my husband.  But after seeing this movie, I have a whole new appreciation for what all the fuss has been about my entire life.  Visually stunning and a nice story to boot.  The soundtrack is now a staple in our music library.  A wonderful way to introduce a new generation to the brilliant songwriting of Paul McCartney and the much missed Jon Lennon.

We were looking for celtic style music to walk down the aisle to and thought that this would be a good place to look.  I really think this is an excellent sound track.  There is one song in there that we may use for our party named Flaming Red Hair.  Also, I think the bridesmaids will walk down the aisle to excerpts from The Shire.  We'll see how it goes.  Anyway, even if we don't use the music, I think it is an excellent soundtrack.

B0011NVC9I|5.0|Beowulf (Unrated Director's Cut)      The quest for immortality has burned in the heart of the human soul since time began on this planet of limitations.  From the ancient past, the hero song of glory can be heard today if time is taken to listen to the aged wind melodies which sing about us.    The retelling of the Beowulf saga fits in with the current emphasis on legends and heroes that the current society seeks to find.  This seeking, at its essential core, is discovering a link to the past, perhaps a heritage lost in the current system of K-12 or the complexity of our techno existence.    In many ways Beowulf is a tale loaded with sadness and eventuality.  Fate can be a cruel taskmaster for a hero.  Most heroes of ancient lore did not get the Princess in the end and live happily ever after.  These epoch stories are not children's fairytales.  They deal with the essentials of the human soul in conflict with good and evil.     There is an undertone of sadness for the first two acts. King Hrothgar is a tragic figure.  He is introduced as a drunken king with a young wife who loathed him.  The reason is revealed later on in the movie.  His death is a necessity born in his youth by those decisions that a young hero foolishly made.    Beowulf's arrogance is only overshadowed by his prowess as a warrior.  His boasting is a mixture of actual fact and pure fantasy. Self promotion was not a stranger to Beowulf.    He did not care for gold.  His quest was glory, and thereby songs and stories of his exploits would give him the immortality which life did not afford to a human on this planet.  The afterlife was a vague, uncertain realty.    Beowulf and his men walk into the story without any idea what they would be facing.  To them Grendel is just another monster for heroes to dispatch to the forgotten regions where monsters go at death.    Every hero needs a companion who is a true friend.  A true friend accepts the hero with all of his faults. Wiglaf is such a friend.The fight with Grendel, a creature part human and part demon, demonstrates that even the bravest heroes are destined for disappointment.  Beowulf's defeat of Grendel is a shallow victory.  The receipt of the golden dragon horn from King Hrothgar was an enchanted treasure which concealed a deadly curse.    Beowulf had to face Grendel's mother, a water demon, whose beauty was only known to those who had succumbed to her carnal snares.  Beowulf was a hero, but he was always a mortal man.    In act three, Beowulf must face a creature born of a moment lost in time.  He realized that the curse concealed in the golden dragon horn had to end with him, or it would continue from generation to generation.  In many ways the ancient hero knew when the time for his death was on the horizon.    Before he and Wiglaf rode off to face the dragon, he said to Wealthow, his queen and wife, to remember him not as a hero or king, but a man--a mortal man scarred by human weaknesses. The man, who once loved her with all of his heart, was the memory that he wanted her to hold in her arms at night, especially during the long nights to come without him.    The battle of Beowulf and the dragon is one of the best fight sequences that I have ever seen.  The old warrior must call from his inward being every ounce of what the songs and stories told of him--to be the hero of the legends once more in order to save his queen and his people.  He did rise to the challenge.      The ending of the hero is always an emotional journey for the viewer of these movies.  You have invested your time and money into watching this presentation of these new story tellers of our age.    Beowulf rewards this investment.    The ending, as the sun sets, is one of the most insightful moments for Wiglaf.  I will not say more except that everyone must face that moment sometime in life--\\"temptation, sadness and indecision\\" as my son-in-law stated as we finished the movie. My daughter did not care for the movie.    This version of the movie is not suitable for children.  It is an adult tale with many adult themes.  It is unrated for a definite reason.
B0002V7O3I|5.0|I haven't seen this in a very long time.  I have to say, it still makes me laugh.  Its effects still look pretty good today.  The actors were all the right ones for the parts they played.  It's a good romping movie.  It's also, I think, everyone's dream when they are a kid.  I mean, how many of us wished we could have done this?  How many would have killed to do this?  It's a good \\"family\\" movie as well.  Yes, there is the scene where they sip from the beer, but it isn't like they are knocking back a six-pack.  Most of it gets squirted around as if it were champagne anyway.  It is still a very good movie even after all these years.

I've not heard any of the other recordings, so I cannot comment as to how it compares to them.  I can't see any being better than this, but there is a small chance I could be wrong.  But, if you own the DVD (or VHS for that matter) three words: PICK THIS UP!
B0012Q94QW|3.0|About a year ago I saw a teaser for this movie and I must say it really got me excited.  I think, however, the preview is a bit misleading and I will wager that a lot of men are gonna be complaining after seeing this movie, which disquised itself as an action film, and is in truth at its core, a love story.<br /><br />  The story follows D'leh (played by actor Steven Strait) a young man who lives in a snowy village of hunters.  The villagers have been slowly loosing their food supply (wooly mammoths) and the leader of the people, a woman called Old Mother, prophesies the rise of a leader during the last hunt of her people.  She makes this prophesy after a small group of hunters bring to the village a young girl with piercing blue eyes, called Evolet, who was abandoned after her people were killed by four legged demons (men on horses).  Over time, D'leh and Evolet fall in love and part of the prophesy is that the man who rises up to lead their people will also take Evolet as his wife.<br /><br />  After the men on horses arrive and take many of the villagers, including Evolet, D'leh and his mentor, Tic Tic, follow the captors and their new slaves in hopes of freeing their family and friends.  Along the way, they come across other tribes who have also been attacked and enslaved by the mauraders and whose remaining members will join the fight if their own prophesy of a warrior to lead them comes true (which, does indeed with D'leh).  The rest of the story is these men trying to find a way to retrieve the slaves from the huge city occupied by the mysterious men who enslave the tribesmen and villagers to build their expanding empire.  And, for D'leh, to free the girl with whom he bonded years ago and swore his love.<br /><br />  The whole time I was watching this film I was struck at how similar the plot is to Mel Gibson's \\"Apocalypto\\", which is a much better film.  That said, I don't think its as horrible as some reviewers are posting but its not the action-packed, prehistoric war epic I think many fan boys were hoping for.  The saber tooth tiger, which looked so awesome and fearful in the teaser, basically had a cameo but the scenes with the mammoths were impressive and great to watch.  Steven Strait, the lead actor is a handsome, charming guy who may have a career ahead of him.  I think he has possiblity, if given time to work on his acting.  The rest of the cast did fairly well in their roles but its more of a popcorn summer film that relies heavily on action sequences and special effects.  If you are in the mood for something to watch, its an okay movie to see.  But you might prefer to stay at home at wait for the dvd release.epic I think many fan boys were hoping for.

B000K7VHJQ|5.0|Really, this film is about Christ's passion.  Hence the title.  Most of the films about Jesus' life previous to this didn't really show the extent to which he suffered.  By the time he is hung on the cross, he doesn't even look bloodied or beaten, just serene and tired.  Most depicitons of Jesus on the cross (paintings, etc) don't show much in the way of what he endured.  It seems sanitized.  I think this tends to make us think that it wasn't so bad for him.  After all, he knew he was going to rise again, right?  So where's the stress?      Well, this movie shows that it WAS tortuous.  It WAS an ordeal.  He did suffer, and suffer greatly.  It's the whole blinkin' point of the movie.  I won't know until I get to heaven (God willing) whether the film is historically accurate, or whether the violence was depicted \\"over the top\\".  I wasn't present on Good Friday, and neither were any of the detractors reviewing here.  But I think the film accomplishes it's point.  It reminds christians of Christ's suffering so we don't go about thinking it couldn't have been that bad (based on the sanitized images we have everywhere).      I think bashing the movie for not having a story line is ridiculous.  It did have one.  And the audience it was intended for knew the story line very well.  This wasn't meant to be entertainment.
B000002IAS|5.0|Unable to purchase this cd which seems so important to all Clapton-fans even in the best equipped music stores in Amsterdam I ordered it through Amazon received it swiftly by mail. Since then I have played it over and over. It captures the energetic performances of a band that knows how to combine musical drive and soulful bliss. As for Clapton: just listen to that solo in 'I don't want to discuss it': without any redundancy this stripped down minimalistic approach epitomizes power and tension in a superbly timed monochordic drone. This is truly stepping down to reach higher.
0230531423|3.0|Yes it is an entertaining story. But it is not up to the standards to which I hold Lord Jeffrey. Similarities to Dumas notwithstanding, I found the tricks and turns that the author is so known for to be entirely transparent and predictable. Further, the characters were much shallower than I am used to in his work. Nevertheless, the book did hold my interst and I did stay up far too late one evening in an effort to finish the book. I enjoyed myself that evening, but I didn't quite respect myself in the morning.

B000FSME1A|4.0|The movie stands up wonderfully -- indeed, it is even better than I remembered. Watching it brought the whole miserable Viet Nam experience back to life. Performances are super -- not just Marlon, either. It's a hoot to see Harrison Ford in a bit part, and Martin Sheen's character surely provides rich back-story for Jed Bartlett, rather the way John Wayne's previous roles made True Grit so persuasive.    Just one reservation: the Redux version is slower, due to self-indulgent editing, and less effective than the original.
B000MXPE7O|3.0|Robert DeNiro's 2006 \\"The Good Sheperd\\" is a thinly fictionalized account of the founding of the Central Intelligence Agency.  It features an array of talented actors, promising plot material, and some incredibly atmospheric cinematography.  It is also a long, dark, unhappy journey into a world so complex as to almost defy translation into a feature length film.<br /><br />The story centers around Edward Wilson, a counterintelligence officer who at the opening of the movie is investigating a security breach affecting the failed CIA-sponsored 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion.  In a series of extended flashbacks, we learn that Edward was a young, idealist Yale graduate recruited into the Office of Strategic Services at the start of the Second World War.  He learns his trade from his British counterparts, already locked into a cutthroat duel with Nazi Germany.  Edward moves on to Berlin at the close of the war to recruit former Nazis and to size up the Soviets, who will be America's postwar competition.  In particular, he meets his Soviet counterpart, a spymaster codenamed Ulysses, who will haunt his career for the next two decades.<br /><br />Edward returns to America in 1946, to a new organization that will become the CIA and to a loveless marriage with a woman he got pregnant right before the war.  His duties will involve him in CIA adventures in Guatemala and Cuba and in handling Soviet defectors.  As the movie circles back to the present, Edward traces a series of clues to the shocking source of the leak on the Bay of Pigs.  The answer will threaten his career and what remains of his family life.<br /><br />Matt Damon plays Edward Wilson as a quiet, dedicated but guarded man; he learns the hard way that no one can be trusted.  The hazards and hard moral choices of his career turn a likeable poetry-loving student into a man all but emotionally inaccessible by movie's end.  Angela Jolie puts in a anguished performance as Wilson's wife, who lives a sterile life with a man often gone and withdrawn when home.  Alec Baldwin has a nice turn as an FBI agent who works with Wilson on a number of cases.  John Turturro is superb as Wilson's long-time assistant.  Billy Crudup and William Hurt play fellow OSS and CIA colleagues.<br /><br />This movie gets a lot of things right about the espionage business.  The founders of the OSS and CIA relied on ties among Ivy League alumni as a substitute for a vetting process.  The spy and counterspy business between the US and Soviet Union did become a wilderness of mirrors.  The Edward Wilson character seems loosely based on James Angleton, the CIA counterintelligence chief who spent years looking for Soviet moles in the CIA.<br /><br />The story is extremely complex, even for those familiar with the history of the CIA.  The average viewer may be challenged to keep track of the characters and their motives.  The focus of the movie is really the effects of the spy business on its practioners; action is infrequent apart from the deaths of several agents.

B000929AJQ|3.0|It took almost six years since Nine Inch Nails issued [[ASIN:B00001P4TH The Fragile]], and Trent Reznor has undergone a lot of changes since then. First and foremost, Trent was pushing 40, had cleaned himself of his substance problems, and had seen the scene he created - for the most part - dissipate. Given the sprawling double disc that preceded it, the concise, meticulously created \\"With Teeth\\" bore the sounds of an artist settling into his skin.<br /><br />While many musicians would meet that phase with strings, ballads and maybe a duet with Celine Dion, Reznor took the anger and angst he'd mustered through the first three NiN albums and became an adult about them. Where other songs dealt with politics marginally and from the screaming outsider perspective, this time Reznor took focused aim and let the barrage of \\"The Hand That Feeds\\" fly straight into the tempest of life after 9/11. (Not that great a leap...\\"The Fragile\\" was made while Bill Clinton was still in office). There is a lot of rage against the machine here, but there's still plenty of noise to be brought on. The title track and \\"All The Love In the World\\" are exactly what you'd expect from a Nine Inch Nails album.<br /><br />But with maturity comes wanderlust. Funk enters the equation with \\"Only\\" and \\"Sunspots,\\" making a different kind of dance music and not completely removed from [[ASIN:B000001Y5Z The Downward Spiral's]] \\"Closer.\\" Just made from a steadier and more experienced hand. There is still plenty of muscle here, what holds \\"With teeth\\" back is that Trent has tread this path all too well and better. I still dig this, I just don't pull it out for play as often as I still do the first two CD's. The good news is this focus was a precursor to the wildly superior political concept album [[ASIN:B000O178BY Year Zero]]. Both of these albums in the new century show that Trent Reznor still has a lot left to say.
6305910340|4.0|Great movies are never what they seem to be about on the surface, they always touch on larger themes.  \\"Searching For Bobby Fischer\\" is not about chess, although a lot of chess is played in the movie.  It's not about Bobby Fischer either, although Josh (Max Pomeranc), the movie's central character, mythologizes about him quite a bit (as a player, not, thankfully, in light of some of Fischer's bizarre proclivities, as a person).      This film is about not living vicariously through your children, and having a full and complete life.  The movie's tagline: \\"He wasn't afraid of losing a match...just his father's love\\" makes the whole affair sound more cloying than it actually is.  Josh Waitzkin is a real person (and still the highest ranked player in the US in his age group) whose father is a sportswriter.  Fred Waitzkin (Joe Mategna), after getting over his initial discomfort at losing to his son in chess, realizes how talented the boy is and arranges for lessons with chess teacher Bruce Pandolfini (played by Kingsley) and, later, signs him up for tournaments where he discovers that, while being a certified prodigy, Josh lacks the killer instinct we generally think that our champions have to have in any competitive endeavor.  How the adults in Josh's life cope with this, and how they help him cope with it, forms the core of the movie.    How Steven Zallian (who wrote the screenplay for Schindler's List, also released in '93, but directing for the first time here) managed to get this cast I'll never know.  Mantegna is a Tony award winner (for Glengarry Glen Ross), Ben Kingsley is an Academy Award winner, and Joan Allen and Laurence Fishburne are Academy Award nominees and those are just the lead roles.  In addition, Laura Linney, William H. Macy, and David Paymer also went on to become Academy Award nominees and people like Tony Shalhoub, Dan Hedaya, and Anthony Heald turn up in small parts.  Needless to say, the performances are outstanding.    But it doesn't stop there--the talent behind the camera is equally as impressive.  The Producer is Scott Rudin (who accepted the Oscar for Best Picture this year for No Country For Old Men) and the film was exec produced by Sydney Pollack.  Two time Academy Award winner (for American Beauty and The Road To Perdition) Conrad L. Hall is the movie's Director of Photography and, like any movie he ever shot (Butch Cassidy and The Sundace Kid, All the President's Men), the film is absolutely gorgeous to look at.  Even the film's composer, James Horner, is an Oscar winner (for Titanic).    In the that's-kind-of-cool department, real life chess champions (Joel Benjamin and Kamran Shirazi to name a few) turn up as themselves and the real Bruce Pandolfini and Katya Waitzkin (Josh's sister) have cameos.    The film handles the questions on the importance of winning and the sacrifices it sometimes entails (nobody would want to have lived Bobby Fischer's life) with grace and sensitivity.  Add it all up and you have a wonderful gem of a movie, one that isn't just for chess lovers.    This particular DVD release is not a good one--there are no extras of any kind which is odd since even the VHS version of the movie had some extras.  Still this is a movie to treasure.
0152048049|1.0|Antoine de St. Exupery's The Little Prince is one of the most beautiful, insightful, and touching works ever written in any language.  It is not really a story for children, although children do enjoy it.  Do read it as a child, and over again through the years.  Yet it is only after a lifetime experienced in love and disappointments, joy, loss, sorrow, hope, and resilience, that one can most deeply appreciate this beautiful jewel.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Howard's translation is disappointingly bland and, in places, actually inaccurate.  Don't waste your time.  I'm surprised that the publisher permitted this travesty, which reduces de St. Exupery's richly descriptive prose to a ten-minute bedtime story.

B0010X8NF0|4.0|\\"The Darjeeling Limited\\" tells the story of the Whitman brothers: Francis (Owen Wilson), Jack (Jason Schwartzman), and Peter (Adrien Brody). The brothers haven't spoken since their father's funeral and each one finds himself at a crossroads. Francis has just attempted suicide by crashing his motorcycle into a cliff. Peter and Jack's problems are with the women in their life. Peter is about to be a father and he is terrified at the prospect. Jack can't let a girl (Natalie Portman) who treats him like crap go. Francis brings his brothers together for a train ride through India aboard the Darjeeling Limited. He hopes that the trip will  allow them to be brothers again. The combined effects of years of not trusting one another, Jack getting too friendly with the help, overusing prescription medications, or bringing a lethal snake on board get the boys thrown off the train and stranded in the middle of nowhere with tons of luggage and a laminating machine. As they continue their journey by foot they stumble into a village where  tragedy  strikes that changes each of them for good. The acting is exceptional with Adrien Brody as the standout. His character is the one who gets a real wake up call in the village and the way he  plays these scenes is just beautiful. Wilson, whose own suicide attempt marred this film's promotion, does a sad and funny job of balancing the wild man aspects that cant' hide the deep loneliness and sadness that Francis feels. Schwartzman, who co-wrote the screenplay with his cousin Roman Coppola, and Anderson, gives a very mature performance as a heartbroken young man who manages to find a new romance aboard  the train. His rebound fling with the stewardess Sweet Lime is very sweet to watch. The script is perfect at capturing all the pain and regret that the brothers have been coping with but also coming up with bizarre and hilarious adventures for them to get caught up in. There is a lot of truth in the writing that makes you wonder how much of the script comes from real life events between the three men. Coppola lost his older brother young, Schwartzman's father died, and Anderson's brother is a frequent collaborator on his films. Anderson's brilliant use of music works to great effect here unearthing such gems from the Kinks and The Stones as well as using a lot of great world music as well. These songs, especially during the funeral in the village, the boy's reunion with their mother (Anjelica Huston), or the final shot of the boys trying to catch their train are pure poetry.  Some people have complained that the symbolism towards the end where the boys let go of all of their baggage before hopping the train home is a bit heavy handed but if you're going to get hung up on a point like that you've  completely missed the point of the film. My only complaint with the DVD is that I wish the extras were more substantive. This film begs for a Criterion release complete with an in depth making of and a couple of commentaries: one from the stars, the other from the writers. What we do get is a Walking Tour that is supposed to serve as a behind the scenes but that doesn't have any interviews. The other bonus feature, and at least it's a good one, is the short film \\"Hotel Chevalier\\". Despite featuring a super sexy and nearly nude Natalie Portman it serves as the back story for Jack. It explains why he can't let a wild woman like this go and sets up all of his hangups with women. True fans of the film can only hope that Criterion will do this film justice some day. Despite a disappointing selection of extras this film alone is  jam packed. There are moments where you're  laughing out loud and then in a matter of minutes you're fighting back tears. It's  a beautiful film visually and emotionally.  For the first time in a long time I can agree with Peter Travers who declares on the front of the DVD \\"I love this movie. More than one of the year's best films.\\"

The story has some good twists in it, but it was particularly the grace that got me more than anything. But if you are wanting a fast paced action thriller then this is not for you. Make sure to watch it in the Mandarin version with English subtitles unless you understand Mandarin, as the movie just isn't the same when it is dubbed.

Anyone who has been following Badu since 1997's brilliant debut BADUIZM knows that Ms. Badu is certainly not your \\"typical\\" R&B star. Badu is rich in the influence of the mystical, spirituality outside of what most would deem \\"normal\\" conventions, which has always translated into her music.  Combine this with a five year hiatus (2003's WORLDWIDE UNDERGROUND EP was her last release) and heightened sense of politics, and you get the chanteuse's most colorful and most puzzling album, 2008's NEW AMERYKAH. No surprise, most people won't understand it, even following several listens.  Critics will both adore it while others will practically \\"damn it to hell\\".  Either way, this is an innovative, creative endeavor on the part of Ms. Badu.<br /><br />The album starts off with a bang with the funky \\"Amerykahn Promise\\" which is less about singing and more about Ms. Badu's political ruminations.  To call it a strong vocal performance would be an overstatement, but it certainly does make a statement - whatever that statement may be.  \\"The Healer/Hip Hop\\" is a certified hit, one of Ms. Badu's best.  The production is first rate and Badu's lazy, Billie Holiday influenced vocals are stronger than ever as she croons \\"this one is the healer, hip Hop\\".  She also namechecks the late J-Dilla in this awesome track.  \\"Me\\" keeps up the speed and is perhaps the most mainstream track up to this point. Think mainstream Erykah when you listen to \\"Me\\" as opposed to artsy, indulgent Erykah.  Three tracks in, NEW AMERYKAH is certainly something to talk about.<br /><br />\\"My People\\" throws another curve ball.  It begins with a radio broadcaster stating \\"I'm a bad motherf***** and I don't mind telling you\\". Then Erykah mumbles through a repetitive hook (\\"my people\\") with a few inserted ad libs.  Not exactly conventional, but interesting to say the least, which is the general sentiment of NEW AMERYKAH.  \\"Soldier\\" brings Erykah back to the mainstream for one of the album's strongest tracks. The production is conventional and Erykah sounds top notch. On \\"The Cell\\", Badu experiments once more, but she combines the best of the experimental and the accessible here, which makes it much better than say \\"My People\\".<br /><br />\\"Twinkle\\" is another experimental track, but it is effective, if not stellar.  \\"Master Teacher\\" is truly political in which Erykah mentions anti-slave sentiment making parallels to the past.  \\"That Hump\\" is another five-star track in which Badu has never sounded better. Erykah sings her head off on this one and the production is ingenius. \\"That Hump\\" is followed up by the excellent \\"Telephone\\". NEW AMERYKAH is definitely more foward steps than back steps, despite how odd it really is.  Finally, standout first single \\"Honey\\" shows up, albeit a bonus track. As strong as it is, there are tracks just a strong as \\"Honey\\" if not stronger.  If you tend to favor more mainstream Erykah, \\"Honey\\" and similar tracks such as \\"Me\\" or \\"Soldier\\" will be more up your alley.<br /><br />While NEW AMERYKAH isn't perfect, it is nearly, even if it is in some sonic facet as opposed to a mainstream R&B facet.  It is more experimental than neo-soul, though there is plenty of soulful backdrops coupled with hip-hop sensibilities to grap onto.  Honestly, I had to listen through NEW AMERYKAH before I could truly begin to understand it or even hope to review.  With that said, this album is one that could possibly stand the test of time where innovation and such is concerned.  A bit over the top sometimes, but genius always in my opinion.  4 stars.oldier\\" brings Erykah back to the mainstream for one of the album's strongest tracks.

B00005O3VD|5.0|This movie is such a great movie! I just bought it the other day and I really got my money's worth. I didn't realize how long it was, but in a good way! It is one where you don't mind how long it is because it is so good.<br /><br />If you love the classics you will love this movie! It is a musical and the music I think is really pleasing to the ears.<br /><br />Parts of it are also really FUNNY! I know why they called it Funny Girl. With a more serious ending that really brought the movie together and gave a whole new meaning to the title.

B000002I6T|5.0|In a monumental career that has spanned four decades, David Crosby was never better than on his debut solo album, If I Could Only Remember My Name. Not with the Byrds, Not with CSN, not with CSN&Y, not with CPR. Though all of those configurations have produced wonderful moments and consequent legendary status, Crosby himself has never shown so brightly as he does here. His story telling ability showcased in Cowboy Movie, a thinly disguised tale of the ill fated CSNY tour is a riot to decipher. His ode to music, Music is Love featuring a waif like vocal from Neil Young, His glorious vocals on songs like Song With No Name, Tree With No Leaves or Orleans, this record demonstrated all that was and is great about David Crosby. Such a shame that drug abuse stifled this wonderful talent for so long.     If anybody ever wants to know what the aura of San Francisco was in the late sixties, go no farther than this wonderful record.
B000VWE5OY|5.0|Kind of reminds me of Farscape but set on Earth.  I'm not sure how to explain it or even if I need to do a review on it, what with all the others.  But I will say this - IT is worth any price.  [...]  It has good stories, warm, charging characters who are NOT the same people by the end of the season as they were at the start, and it really has that epic, end of the world, feel that one demands in a Doctor Who? spin off.  Sorry Sarah Jane Smith, but you and K-9 could not cut it.  Captain Jack and the Gang CAN.
0765348780|1.0|I have loved the fantasy genre since I first read Robert Jordan's \\"The Eye of the World\\" over ten+ years ago.  I have read series by Tad Williams, George R. R. Martin, Stephen King, etc., so I'm not an unseasoned (or unintelligent) afficianado.  But let me tell you, I started reading \\"Gardens of the Moon\\" five times before I finally forced myself to finish the entire disgraceful mess.  What does anyone see in this series??  Yes, Martin's \\"Song of Ice & Fire\\" series piles on too many characters, but at least he develops them and makes them come to life.  There is not one paragraph of substantial character development in this entire book.  It's all plot and all action, and even these are given fragmented, slice-and-dice treatment.  It's like Erikson conjured a hundred or so Dungeons & Dragons type names, gave them each some pointless action and cardboard dialogue, then threw them all together in a type of mish-mash stew that looks like a fantasy epic but tastes like rat dung.  This is the most painful experience I've encountered with the genre.  Anyone can write 600 pages of nothing, but it takes at least a little talent to fill those pages with something resembling a good, enjoyable story.

0452289963|5.0|[[ASIN:0452289963 A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose (Oprah's Book Club, Selection 61)]]Eckart's writings affirm what I have grown to know over the last 20 years, that our ego is what seperates us from that which created us.  He makes complex issues simple to read and to understand.  With a Master of Pastoral Studies and a focus in Spiritual Direction, I guide people in and through their \\"dark night of the soul\\" in which, they become aware of the ego and how the ego, \\"edges God out.\\" I then move them into the awareness that they are one with that which created them.  This empowers people to become volunteers in their own life and not victims of society, their past, ect.  This is what Tolle is doing with his book, I know the people who read this without resistance will begin the process of freeing themselves from the bondage of self and awaken into a life of peace, love, joy, and happiness.  I encourage all to read this book as well as The Power of Now.[[ASIN:0340898917 Power of Now]]. We recently completed our book study on A New Earth, it was amazing the insights so many people recieved.  We were able to see ourselves in the book. With the awareness of ourselves, we were able to make necessary changes in our lives.  It is definitely a book to read and reread.  I am greatful to have facilitated the book study because it forced me to focus and really apply the information in my life in order to effectively share the book with our group.  Our group consisted of men and women with varied ethnicity and religious beliefs.  We were amazed that we all found value in the book.   Another book which is a powerful and life changing book is Left to Tell by Immaculee Ilibagiza,[[ASIN:1401908977 Left to Tell: Discovering God Amidst the Rwandan Holocaust]]. This book is about a Rawandan Holocaust survivior who experienced her \\"Dark Night of the Soul\\" in a 3 X 4 bathroom for 91 days with 7 other women as approx. 1 million of her tribe were slaughtered.  It is her journeyof facing her ego, her beliefs, her pain and fear and awakening to the power that dwells within all people.  It is a powerful story of forgiveness and claiming our truth that we are one with that which created us.  It is an applied book of what Tolle is teaching.  I am so excited that Oprah chose this book.  I believe when we awaken to the truth of who we are, we are able to accept all people in love and compassion and we will know peace.  When we have peace within ourselves, we will experience peace on our planet.  Enjoy your read,  Becky Benes, Onenessoflife.com
184195425X|1.0|The Life of Pi is one of the worst books I have ever read. When I first heard about it, I thought it was about \\"PI\\", you know, 3.1614 etc. That would have made a much more interesting read. I read it because it had been mentioned in some negative reviews of \\"A House for Mr Biswas\\" by V S Naipaul, as a positive example of a book about India/Indians. How absolutely incomprehensible. The Life of Pi is ridiculously pretentious, and has about as much spiritual depth as \\"Jonathan Livingston Seagull\\" (and about as much hype as that book did). A truly pathetic book.
B0006GAI6Y|3.0|**1/2 2004. Directed by Peter Chelsom. Average Hollywood gauged product about a man who discovers that he likes to dance. No artistic ambition here, just a camera that films Richard Gere, Jennifer Lopez and Susan Sarandon as if they were passing in front of the camera of your cell phone. The definitive movie about ballroom dancing still is Australian director Baz Luhrmann's [[ASIN:B00005V1Y0 Strictly Ballroom]]. This one is already forgotten.
B000I5YCCO|5.0|I usually don't care for country, but I have music in pretty much any genre and am willing to expand.  I found that I really liked Carrie Underwood's stuff, and then I heard about Taylor Swift.  I downloaded the album on Zune and put it in with my 2500 plus songs to be shuffled as I made my way around from place to place.  Every song that came up have proven to be lovely gems.  She gives it a lovely country twang but doesn't overdo it, and her lyrics relate well to an 18 year old college freshman like me.  My favorite has to be \\"Teardrops on My Guitar\\" because I relate the most tp those lyrics.  Like Taylor in the song, I have had my share of unrequited crushes.  I also like the contrast of her homely style to my more epic stuff like U2 or the Les Mis and Spring Awakening soundtracks when I put my Zune on shuffle.  It wouldn't be fair to compare her to Carrie Underwood as they're 2 different performers and Ms Underwood has a few years on her.  Apples and oranges, I like both.  I am happy that I have found this treasure :).

0553381687|2.0|This book is meant for the fastidious avid reader. A reader that doesn't mind sifting through a couple hundred pages before the fun  begins. With endless lists of names and titles the first half of the book is reminiscent of history text books. However once through the tedium of learning who all of the characters of the book are and the author finally finishes his base the action begins. All in all not too bad, but i wouldn't recommend it to anyone looking for a fun book to read.
B0010ZR160|4.0|Casey is a strange choice for the leading role. He is a small guy and has a laid back approach. When he does decide to take action, it is a little unsettling. It is like a Smurf stabbing you in your big toe with a big knife you didn't know it had. It actually works. The setting is South Boston in its rawest and grittiest form. The story seems straightforward, until you realize no one is as they seem. How Affleck reveals the mystery and the motives of the characters is fairly interesting. The moral dilemma the characters make at the end can be easily defended from both ends and makes for good conversation. Ed Harris, Morgan Freeman, et al. do a great job in this movie. Ben Affleck does a great job as director. It is an interesting movie.    The only downside is that the movie drags a little in the middle and the accents are a little hard to understand at times. The movie is interesting and pretty intense for most of the movie.
B000ZN802W|4.0|Christopher McCandless, in becoming 'Alexander Supertramp', holds a mirror to us all, a meditation on what the ideal life completely in tune with nature, surviving only on ingenuity and adaptation skills, leaving the increasingly burdensome conflicts of society behind in order to become at one with the universe.  Based on Jon Krakauer's reconstruction of McCandless' journey from his diary, from letters, and from notes found after his death at age 23, IN THE WILD has been transformed into a Waldenesque film by Sean Penn who provided both the screenplay and the direction.  While some may argue the very loose technique of relating this story, few will come away form this film untouched by the sheer dreamy valor of a youth determined to find his own connection to the meaning of existence.<br /><br />The bright McCandless (Emile Hirsch) graduates from Emory University and faces a celebratory dinner with his wealthy but dysfunctional parents (William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden) and his adoring younger sister Carine (Jena Malone).  During the stilted and revealing dinner Christopher declines his parents' gift of a new car and instructions on how to proceed with his life of success, instead electing to leave it all behind and secretly set off on a personal journey to live in the wild. Stripping himself of worldly possessions he begins his road trip with the ultimate destination being Alaska. Along the way he encounters various people: Wayne Westerberg (Vince Vaughan) who offers him work harvesting grain and camaraderie; Jan and Rainey (Catherine Keener and Brian Dierker), two middle-aged hippies who offer him a sense of family; Tracy (Kristen Stewart), a 16-year old who offers him physical love Christopher cannot condone; a Danish couple he encounters while rafting; and the elderly Frank (Hal Holbrook) who has no family and lives alone making leather trinkets, eager to 'belong' to the young man whom he sees as needy yet courageous.<br /><br />Christopher's journey pretty much covers America and Mexico, from the plains and farms to the homeless streets of Los Angeles to the splendors and natural cruelties of nature in Alaska.  His struggles survive are balanced by his inebriation with the wonders of the natural world untouched by society. Yet in the end he faces his own dissolution into the dust of nature alone.<br /><br />Hirsch immerses himself in this physically demanding role and manages to hold onto our hearts all through his journey.  The flow of the story is at times discordant with the over voice narration by Jena Malone and the insertion of bits and pieces of quotations that aren't pieced tightly together enough to avoid sounding superficial.  Yet the supporting cast is very strong, including a brilliant little cameo by Cheryl Francis Harrington as a social worker with heart.  The photography (Eric Gautier) is stunning and the musical score, courtesy of Michael Brook, Kaki King, and Eddie Vedder, fits the mood through the film. And throughout the film Sean Penn has the restraint and taste to keep the story vital without ever making it maudlin.  A very fine film.

B000ZN258W|5.0|I think the gist of this one can pretty much be summed up with the line, \\" we've been scribbled in the margins of a story that is patently absurd\\" ( Lie Down Here & Be My Girl).<br /><br />Cave & the Bad Seeds' 14th  pretty much picks up where Grinderman left off. But where that album's Garage/ Blues lampoon was more of a lark, the stakes have been raised on Dig.  Mad carny swirls of organ replace the tickling ivories of yore. Lashing Fenders duke it out with sleazy bass lines. There's even a lute (courtesy of the criminally gifted Warren Ellis). Throughout Cave holds court with self-mocking swagger. In short, this is a Bad Seeds record unlike anything that ever came before.<br /><br />I will say that fans of Cave's Boatman's Call balladry are likely to be disappointed. The only things that would remotely qualify as ballads are hauntingly atmospheric numbers like \\"Hold Onto Yourself\\" & \\"Jesus Of The Moon. Lyrically, Cave empties out the asylum here. The songs are sprawling, surreal narratives that hark back to the Dylan Subterranean Homesick/ Desolation Row tradition. Some might say the man needs an editor, but they'd just be missing the point. In terms of the writing, he's hit on a perfect mix of the literary & the profane.<br /><br />I've always maintained that fans & critics often take Cave far more seriously than he does. Never has this been more apparent than on Dig. This is a playful, groove laden & hilariously over the top record. Cave's sense of satire & contempt has never been so off the cuff.<br /><br />The title cut is in the Lyre of Orpheus tradition, once more yanking the carpet out from under an established mythological figure. In this case, the victim is poor Lazarus, resurrected from the dead only to be so mortified, he yearns to dig himself back into the grave. His spade of choice---debauchery.  One listen & you'll be chanting, \\"Lazrus dig yourself\\" for days. Suffice it to say, Cave wields the double entendre like a switchblade.<br /><br />\\"Today's Lesson\\" seems to be nothing more than, \\"congregating around the intersection of Janie's jeans\\". Guess it all could be summed up by the song's refrain, clearly echoing the Stooges classic \\"Real Cool Time\\". By far the eeriest track is \\"Night Of The Lotus Eaters\\" seconded by the ominous travelogue, \\"Albert Goes West\\". Classic Cave. Word play reaches a fore with \\"We Call Upon The Author\\" which manages to merge the meaningful with the absurd. For my money, \\"Midnight Man\\" is one more on the list of standouts.  The shamelessly catchy \\"More News From Nowhere\\" closes the door on a suitably warped note.<br /><br />In this age of downloading I say this one makes a strong case for the validity of the album format.

0452289963|3.0|I read this book cover-to-cover and it didn't change my life. The \\"teachings\\" contained within are nothing new and spritually minded readers will best be served by continuing on their own faithful journeys. It doesn't hurt, however, to take in the message of losing one's ego and an evolution of thinking. Read it as a study the way you would read something on any topic, but don't read it with the notion that it's going to change your life.

The storytelling is phenomenal, even though the story is difficult to swallow. The craft of the author, however, brings the characters to life and it's impossible to put it down until the final page.

0393061310|2.0|Reading this book I wasn't able to buy into his arguments.  Too many sweeping generalizations and too many factual errors in the text.  For example, when talking about bananas he writes about early man selecting for smaller and smaller seeds until there weren't any more.  Modern seedless bananas are that way because they are triploid and sterile.  This is something that has happened fairly recently, probably within the last couple of hundred years.  Sloppy terminology, factual errors and the sweeping generalizations ruined this book for me.

0060931736|5.0|Imaginatively asking and answering questions to and for her students, protagonist Miss Brodie leads her set of six young women from the ages of 10 to 18 --  a journey that they define to be the \\"main influence of their school days.\\"<br /><br />Each girl in the set is different.  Like the seven dwarfs, you could nickname the six girls: Rose Stanley (Sexy); Monica Douglas (Brainy); Eunice Gardner (Splits); Sandy Stranger (Pscho); Jenny Gray (Actor) and Mary MacGregor (Sleepy). This eclectic group of naive minds are entranced by the nouveau concepts and manners of Miss Brodie -  a uniquely gregarious and open character of the feminine gender in the 1930's Scotland.<br /><br />Chapter 3 starts with a definition of this woman and her peers. \\"It is not to be supposed that Miss Brodie was unique at this point of her prime. . . there were legions of her kind during the nineteen-thirties. . . who crowded their war-bereaved spinsterhood with voyages of discovery into new ideas and energetic practices in art or social welfare, education or religion.\\" Such \\"normal women of the 1930's\\", who otherwise would be anomalies in their society, were brain trusts which excited and engaged the minds of their students.  The author had such a role model with a Christina Kay whose personality was the foundation of this fictional character.<br /><br />Amid the book, as the girls mature in age and mind, the secret society of the \\"set\\" grows stronger with Miss Brodie. They behave - say little (Speaking is silvery, silence is golden.) and reticently defy all inquiries by the headmistress of the school who only suspects the worst of Miss Brodie.

0321544080|3.0|The Moment It Clicks certainly entertains as you read along. Reviewers, such as Scott Kelby, laud its conversational tone, and the tone works both for and against Mr. McNally. (In some stories, he comes off as less than charming.) The book seems made to be consumed in bite-sized chunks. Each two page spread illustrates an individual \\"secret\\", sometimes accompanied by \\"how to get this kind of shot\\" instructions. Overall, the book is an enjoyable read without being at all complex. There's something in it for beginners and more advanced photographers.     My primary criticism of the book is that the tips range from those that are so simple as to be easily overlooked (\\"don't light all of it\\") to so odd as to be irrelevant (\\"use a mime\\"). In my opinion, there were too many tips of the latter type. As a result, the book feels needlessly padded.
B00003CWOL|1.0|I found DOGMA to be such a monumental waste of time that it set a real precedent in my life for a wasted evening.  As someone who can enjoy almost any well-intentioned movie this film was a total waste of time, energy and resources.  Since I am a lifelong confirmed horror and sci-fi fan I am not the least \\"high brow\\", nor do I hold any strong opinions regarding organized religion. I also would not consider myself to be prudish in any way and irreverence towards organized religion has never bothered me enough to spoil a good film.<br /><br />When I went to the theater to see DOGMA I was on vacation in Newport Road Island with my wife when a trusted friend recommended that we see this film. The party in question shall remain nameless, but after seeing this movie I questioned his sincerity and certainly his advice from that day on. We also were not able to see the very excellent GREEN MILE which was also playing, and I suppose I regret missing that film as much as catching this one.<br /><br />I am also dismayed at the number of multi-star votes this film received on Amazon. It would appear that the producer, director or some vast left wing conspiracy must be members of a large \\"family\\" (or some other organization) who have a vested interest in this film.  I simply can't believe the outcome of the Amazon statistics. Someone has been stuffing the ballot box!

B000Y7U98C|1.0|The title of my review says it all. I have watched and studied manned spaceflight since the Apollo missions and the conflicts that the crew engage in on board this fictional spacecraft would never have occured with a crew carefully selected and vetted for a mission as important as this one (save humankind from a dying sun). I think the actors themselves are great from other roles I've seen them in but the characters that they portray are just terrible, from a navigator that does a number of calculations and cross checks them three times yet still puts the spacecraft in a situation that nearly destroys the mission, spacecraft and crew to a pilot with such a huge ego he engages in a fistfight with a physicist on board for whatever thinly explained reason (didn't have as much testosterone as the pilot?) and so on and so forth. The premise of the movie sounded interesting but I'm glad I only rented this as the overall experience was so negative and false as to rank this with some of the worst movies I've ever seen. I'm glad I only rented this, if I had bought it the DVD would be getting good use as a coaster or frisbee.
0385341067|5.0|Mister Pip by Lloyd Jones, is a story about so many things, it is hard to make any definitive statement about it.  It is a story about literature, and at least one student's journey to falling in love with it, it is about family and the struggles with loyalty and resentment, it is a story about war and the destruction it caused to one village simply minding their own business, and it is the story about the impact one person can make on so many lives.  The novel takes place on an island in Papua New Guinea and centers around a thirteen year old girl named Matilda, who seeks refuge from her life on the island where a civil war has broken out, and finds that refuge in an unlikely school teacher and the novel, Great Expectations.   When all of the teachers flee Bougainville to avoid the war that is coming their way, it is Mr. Watts, the last white man on the island, who steps us and volunteers to teach these young minds.  However, with limited resources and no real teaching experience, Mr. Watts relies on his copy of Mr. Dickens' Great Expectations to teach the children.  Every day he reads another chapter of \\"the greatest novel by the greatest English writer of the nineteenth century\\" and every day Matilda finds herself drawn to the story and the characters.  Lloyd tells a story about the impact of stories.  In a way, Great Expectations saves Matilda's life.  It is what gives these kids the power of imagination and we learn, through Lloyd, how truly important that is.  As a prospective English teacher, I found this novel endearing and it reinforced in me the reasons I want to teach English.  The characters in this novel come to life and it is nearly impossible not to completely invest yourself in Matilda.  Be prepared to feel a wide range of emotions, as the novel is everything from horrifying to inspiring.  There were times while reading that I found myself to be truly sad, with an awful feeling in the pit of my stomach, and it was then that I realized how powerful this novel is.
B000YDOOU0|4.0|Great playing by the leader, as well as bassist Christian McBride and drummer Antonio Sanchez. Very nice new compositions, as well arrangements of previously recorded Metheny tunes (the red one, when we were free, snova, son of thirteen). Similar in nature to previous trio recordings by Pat. Nothing really new here, just good music played with excellently by 3 musicians in complete rapport.
0312330871|4.0|arguably Agatha Christie's best work. And it is good, and my favorite of hers, but upon rereading I found that the ending was slightly cheapened. There truly was no way to solve this mystery other than being told at the end just how it happened. And I felt the death of one of my favorite characters at the end was just not fitting. But it is a great premise (and I correctly identified the killer, though not the way but somewhat of the reason). And it is one of the finest mystery writers at her finest.
B000WTNCYA|5.0|As mentioned by others, Ms. Gardot did an interview on NPR this morning and if there were no samples of her music, I'd still be ordering her CD. She was articulate, smart, engaging and expressed and old soul. But indeed there were samples and that was the icing. One wonders how many hearing the interview could resist getting the CD.
B00009RDGA|5.0|In 1971 Peter Bagdanovich gave us the superlative \\"The Last Picture Show\\". With a cast of virtual new commers, Timothy Bottoms, Cybil Sheapred, Jeff Bridges and Randy Quaid, Bagdanovich caught lightening in a jar. Then in 1973 he chose to pair father and daughter, Ryan and Tatum O'Neil to give us one of the seventies most memerable movies, Paper Moon.    \\"The Last Picture Show\\" was a glimpse into the lives of lonely and misbegotten characters, living in a down-and-out, oil-bust Texas town. They're all waiting for that last flicker of hope to shine before the camara winds down and the movie house goes dark. \\"Paper Moon\\" explores the incredible journey of two unlikely souls adrift in the American heartland during the depths of the great depression. The background sounds of radio broadcasts connects the viewer with the popular figures of the times. The voices of Jack Benny and Fred Allen along with the music of Ozzie Nelson, Paul Whiteman and Tommy Dorsey all remind us of the innocence of the day. The voice of \\"Frankie\\" Roosevelt tells us of the hard times Americans faced amid sky-high unemployment, record drought and even bank failures. As in \\"The Last Picture Show\\", Bagdanovich knows exactly how to integrate the background \\"radio chatter\\" into the scene with perfection.... \\"Yes folks, let's have another cup of coffee and let's have another piece of pie\\". For Addie and Moze that next cup of coffee is a sleepy little town out across a dusty corn field...and that next piece of pie is some poor, unsuspecting widow waiting with false hope and a kind heart.     Easily two of my favorite movies, \\"The Last Picture Show\\" and \\"Paper Moon\\" are absolutely brilliant. Kudos to Peter Bagdanovich for such picture perfect and finely crafted motion pictures. Surely he caught lightening in a jar yet again. My only hope is that he has at least one more up his sleeve before he packs it all in. Bravo!!! and Thank you Mr. Bogdanavich!!!    P.S. A little triva...Who's the only actor or actress who had parts in both films?

1582701709|5.0|I haven't seen the DVD or heard her voice on the CDs yet.  I just read the book.  It resonated with me.  But I do believe your heart has got to be open to the teachings.  I did not feel I was being scammed since there doesn't appear to be any follow-on \\"let me sell you this class or work book\\" or anything like that.  It was pure and simple and quite personal to the individual reader.  I found every page to offer me some reminder to stay positive about my life.  Thinking positive rarely fails anyone.  I was pretty surprised to read the other reviews left behind.  I think the basic message is if you are positive energy, you will attract positive energy.  Bad things will still happen, but you can face them with positive energy and get through it more quickly.  We now have scientific proof laughter helps us feel better.  Special lighting reduces the need for sedatives in the hospital setting.  Why not feel better and positive from the inside out?  If you thought this read was a waste of time, perhaps you aren't ready to receive the positive energy yet.  If you keep an open heart and open mind, I do believe this one will stick with you.
0201485672|4.0|Refactoring is the process of changing a software system in such a way that it does not alter the external behavior of the code yet improves its internal structure. It is a disciplined way to clean up code that minimizes the chances of introducing bugs. In essence when you refractor you are improving the design of the code after it has been written.    When I first got this hardcover in December 2000, there were no integrated development environments (IDE) that would have easily allowed applying refactorings like Extract Method or Inline Method. Now, in 2008, any IDE like Delphi allows to refactor in one click. So now this book is even more valuable than it was at a time of first publication.

B000YXMMAE|3.0|Radiohead has grown a lot since The Bends and has gone through so many different stages of sound and each album is amazing [with an exception of Pablo Honey, I have not listened to it because no one likes it] and now here comes In Rainbows. Probably the biggest disappointment to me as a new CD of one of my favorite bands. It's boring and absolutely mediocre, they could have done so much more. The sound just goes right through you it's awful, I don't know why I paid 10 Euros for it honestly, I should have just bought it for free. This album is not worth your time.
0375424474|5.0|A great book. Well written with an easy to read style.  Author starts with an imitation into searching for fossils in the field and introduces us to Titaalik a fossil that is the important step between fish and land animals.  Shubin then takes readers on a tour of the human body. He starts with DNA and then proceeds to discuss in detail bone structures, teeth, head development, smell, vision and hearing. In each case he shows the reader the similarities to earlier forms of life and how humans have developed in alternative or more complex configurations.  The reader is left in amazement at the complexity of the human body and the detail of its build up and operation that science has amassed. Case for evolution from fishes is well proven.  If you like this book I recommend another \\"Evolution\\" by D Prothero. This book takes an alternative course and provides a detail review of the fossil evidence that life evolved through simple cells and fish to humans. It will further amplify the material in Shubin's book.

B000021XS0|5.0|Dream Theater is the most musically gifted band on Earth.  Period. While their style is certainly not for everyone, there is no mistaking the sheer musical prowess of all five members of this awesome band.  Their virtuosity is mind-blowing... we all know that, but can these guys actually write songs?!  YES!  They can.  This album proves it better than any of their other efforts.  Often criticized for being overly-technical yet utterly inaccessible, this album blows that notion out of the water.  These songs are very well written, and unlike many other supposed \\"concept albums\\", SFAM actually has an underlying theme, both musically and lyrically.  Very artfully done.  A+

B00012QM8G|5.0|I teach 11th grade history and most of my students have no idea about the \\"Holocaust\\" because it is not talked about much anymore.  My students were mesmerized by this film and disgusted at the same time.  Fascinated by what was happening but also disgusted to think that something like this could actually happen. I recommend this movie to everyone.
B00004T6V4|5.0|I do not know where to start. I originally bought the VHS in the used section of the video store, mainly because it was described as a similar movie to the Full Monty. It as I described to my friends was a diamond in the ruff.   I immediately went out and ordered the DVD and bought the soundtrack. Everyone I have lent the DVD to has gone out and bought it. If you love Rock and Roll this is a must addition to your collection. By far the best Rock and Roll movie out there, I will not go into the details of the movie, as there is not a negative review in any of the other reviews on this sight. . YOU just have to watch it and you will be buying the soundtrack because the only thing bad about this movie is they only play 3 songs in their entirety.

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Not usually one to get overly engrossed in a TV series, Dexter grabbed me from the word \\"go\\".  This is BRILLIANT stuff!  Perhaps the best show I have ever seen.  The acting is top-notch, the character development is extremely well done, the music and cinematography are really artful as well.  Dexter's back story unfolds over the course of the entire season, little by little.  Secrets are revealed in nearly every episode, all of which culminate in a mind-blowing season finale.  Wow, this show totally rocks my face off.  (That's a good thing)
B000ZN8036|3.0|This movie is an adolescent boy's nocturnal emission, and while I found it entertaining, it was far from the profound experience it means to be.    Likeable and intelligent, Christopher McCandless was also self-centered, selfish, and extraordinarily--nay, fatally--foolish.  This movie romanticizes that foolishness to make McCandless's death have \\"meaning.\\"  The fact is, though, he died an idiot's death, and he died desperate. In the movie, his parting written words are, \\"I HAVE HAD A HAPPY LIFE AND THANK THE LORD. GOODBYE AND MAY GOD BLESS ALL!\\"  Those words are accurate--he did write them--but the words that the hunters who found him read posted on the door of the bus were no less believable: \\"S.O.S. I need your help. I am injured, near death, and too weak to hike out of here. I am all alone, this is no joke. In the name of God, please remain to save me. I am out collecting berries close by and shall return this evening. Thank you, Chris McCandless.\\" Not the heroic smiling existential death the movie portrayed and that teenage boys imagine for themselves, is it?    This kid was a lousy son, and a lousy brother, and the movie shows this but distorts his real-life relationship with his parents in order to make his abysmal selfishness less damning.  He took off without leaving word to his family, and never let them know where he was or how he was doing. He disappeared, and 2 years later Mom and Dad found he was dead.  And now this hagiography paints them in a very unflattering light and will haunt them for the rest of their lives.      Chris chose to go into the bush with minimal gear and no map.  Had he taken a map, he'd have realized that only 1/4 mile from where he tried to cross the river he would have found a manual tram in which he could have easily crossed; he wasn't stranded, and he needn't have starved.  He starved a a couple days' hike from the highway, in the middle of summer.  This movie suggests (probably based on early versions of Jon Krakauer's book) that he accidentally poisoned himself by eating a toxic plant that is very hard to distinguish from a certain edible one.  That was speculation, and was proved false by the toxicology report.  McCandless died from simple starvation.  In the middle of summer.  20 miles from a highway.  At one point 1/4 of a mile from a river crossing.  That isn't romantic; it isn't heroic.  It's stupid.  Let's call it what it is, so other young men aren't seduced by the same juvenile hubris.      If this movie didn't purport to be a true story, and didn't romanticize what is really an unhappy story, I wouldn't have a problem with it.  It's well acted and maintains tension from beginning to end.  There were some Hallmark Card moments, but I enjoyed it and would watch it again.  But the movie is a sorry representation of the truth, and if this movie is about anything, it's about truth.

B000YXMMAE|2.0|Perhaps too much substance, not enough SONG STRUCTURE.  Noise is noise.  Anyone can make noise, but crafting a SONG requires a certain skill set that the radiohead boys simply do not have, or have chosen to abandon for some ungodly reason.  There is not a single song to be found here, making it very hard for me to listen to.  Layers upon layers of nonsensical noise for noise's sake.      If I receive one single comment that I am just not sophisticated enough to understand Radiohead, please, save it.  You're only kidding yourselves.
B000I5YCCO|4.0|I was late to jump on the wagon, but I have recently become a Taylor Swift fan. I liked \\"Tim McGraw\\" and \\"Teardrops on My Guitar\\" when I heard them on the radio. \\"Picture to Burn\\" is what finally tipped me to buy the full CD. I also enjoy \\"Cold as You\\", \\"The Outside\\" and \\"Should've Said No\\". She seems very mature for her years and it is refreshing that she does write her own material. Let's hope taylor Swift can stay real.
0451205766|4.0|The book version of the Godfather is a must-read for fans of the movie trilogy. The book (which of course preceded the movie by several years) includes a few minor characters not making the cut for the book, and it expands on the back story of several minor characters, such as Rocco Lampone, Luca Brasi, Al Nieri, Johnny Fontane, and Lucy Mancini).     The book is not, however, as enjoyable or well-done as the movie. Part of the reason certain minor characters were left out of the movie, and other characters roles lessened, is because their plights don't seem to relate much to the dominant storylines, those being the Corleone Family's struggle to remain the most powerful of New York, and Michael's rise to Don. The storylines of Johnny and Lucy especially are there to show the far-reaching influence of rhe Corleones, but still seem to sidetrack the main story.    Parts of the book also seem repetetive, such as the in-depth discussion of Johnny's taste in women. Also, there are certain sequences (such the deaths of Sonny and Appolonia) whose suddenness can only be properly depicted through a visual medium.    Overall a good read, especially for fans of the movie, but don't expect to come away feeling you just read an amazing book.
0307387178|4.0|Do not read if you're about to see the film - Unless you already know the ending. Prospective readers of the book carry on...   Reason being that the book tells all on the first page, whereas the film alludes nothing as to the conclusion.     Into The Wild is surprisingly succinct in its description of Chris/Alex's background, although it comprehensively postulates and details - based on evidence - his motivations and the most salient reason for his decisions and travels.    From page one there are no doubts as to the tragic and ultimately heartbreaking resolution to the young man's travels, which seems unfortunate at first given that we're all lovers of suspense, but this is an account of true events and to dramatise it in that way would be trite and tantamount to exploitative.     From there on out this is a beautifully told, meandering story of Chris/Alex's travels, in his search for a nihilistic escape from property ownership, commercialism, societal and personal anchors, and, most importantly, the restrictions of human relationships.      Whether you believe he was foolhardy, arrogant, naïve, or justified in his exploits - opinions aired by many, in either direction, following Krakauer's published first article in Outside Magazine - there is simply no escaping the fact that his actions were those of a truly free spirit.    As a battle weary and stoic fighter of a hard life lived, the prospect of dread at a harder life yet to be lived, and the experience/knowledge of tragedy and human affliction beyond compare, I'm rarely moved or emotional by the harrowing tableau of others these days, but  I was genuinely affected by Into The Wild. In particular the chapter concerning Ron Franz, the eighty year old with no remaining family, is difficult to not feel saddened by.    Also extremely enjoyable are the two chapters in which Krakauer details his own exploits in the wilderness. His attempt to establish his subject's motives in a context we'd understand through the re-telling of his own story in no way comes across as self-indulgent, but rather an exceptionally interesting account of his own experience and the subsequent reason for the interest, empathy and compassion he feels towards what became of Chris/Alex.    Chris/Alex's journey ends in Alaska, and in a heartbreaking deathbed epiphany he writes one final tragic line that really stuns with its gravity at his painful realisation, that happiness is best shared.  This is a beautiful and inspiring read, extremely well researched and written.      Off-the-beaten-track recommended reading (aside from those books which inspired Chris/Alex) would be: The Mosquito Coast (Paul Theroux, fiction) any of the \\"Extremes\\" by Nick Middleton (factual), and How De Body (Teun Voeten - factual, but infinitely more tragic in its examination of Man's Inhumanity to Man, as the great Burns put it.)
B000002UAX|3.0|The music-buying public has always had a certain love affair with the vaunted \\"double album\\".  Often considered the defining album in a band's career, the double album is rarely that at all.  Instead, it is usually a two-sided album for the sake of being long and \\"epic\\".  The Beatles' White Album suffers from this syndrome, and its a shame.    There are some tremendous songs here, however there is also alot of trash.  Cut the fat and give me 13 quality tracks ANY DAY OF THE WEEK.  \\"Abbey Road\\", and \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\" stand out as much stronger albums in my opinion, and I believe it is due to the selectivity of the material, not necessarily the strength of the best songs on each album.    I liken the White Album to Led Zeppelin's \\"Physical Graffiti\\" - both heralded, both considered by many to mark the pinnacle of each band's respective career.  I see it much differently!  Each of these albums is loaded with good tunes, yet equally chock full of material not suitable to be released.  Trim the fat.  Don't make it long, make it great! The same comparison can be made, albeit to lesser extent, to the Smashing Pumpkins' \\"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness\\" (1995) and the Foo Fighters' \\"In Your Honor\\" (2005), each of which reeks of the same non-selectivity flaw that pervades the majority of double albums.
0446577391|5.0|I felt THE COLLECTORS really didn't end and after reading STONE COLD is the third in the Camel Club Series, I see I was right. STONE COLD picks up where the second book left off.<br /><br />If you've read the previous books, Oliver Stone's past has remained a bit of a mystery. Oh sure, we knew some, but in this one we'll find out all the little details. And for those of you who have been feeling a bit tepid about the first two books, this one will rock your socks off. That said, you'll need to read (or for audio buffs, listen to) the first two books in order to be emotionally invested for this third book. Baldacci has an ending that will leave you absolutely stunned.<br /><br />What a fantastic series!
B000GG4ZBI|1.0|Bought this and read it during a month-long Boulder Outdoor Survival Course in 1994.  It was fascinating to read, but I always had a sense I was being duped, and little alarms kept going off - telepathy? Quarters in Australia?  Come on...  It did not ring true then and it has since become obvious since that it completely misrepresents the Australian aboriginal culture and is a complete work of fiction and self-promotion.  Very disappointing &#34;new-age&#34; fantasy and example of cultural misappropriation.
0790742780|5.0|Take the hottest day of the year, a traffic gridlock, cracked pavements, dirty streets, unwarranted hostility and a general feeling of being short changed. Then add the frustrations of having an estranged wife and child, an extremely jaded and unbalanced mindset, and the frustration of being obsolete with no marketable skills. Set them against the decadent back drop of modern day LA where if you are 'Not economically viable,' you are of no use, and the result is Falling Down.     The tag line 'The Adventures of an Ordinary man at War with the Everyday World,' makes Joel Schumacher's masterpiece sound like the benign story of a working stiff with issues. However Falling Down is a dark and engrossing urban fable, a study into the mind of the disenfranchised and reminder to all that the removal of comfort is a lot closer than we care to believe.     Full of clichés, like the cop on his last day before retiring, Falling Down bravely meets all expectations of stereotypes, rather than challenging them, making for a realistic reflection of a failing society. Here, a man in extremis, without the feral cunning or killer instinct required for a life in the street, makes his way on anger and luck alone, somehow surviving to leave a paper chase of violence and destruction behind.     Relying heavily on symbolism (watch for the Stars and Stripes being knocked over) illustrating a flip side of America running parallel to the hunky dory world occupied by the successful, the over all message of 'No Matter, Never Mind,' is clear in this world where children play next to vagrants dying from AIDS and where Korean grocers can legally steal from the public with their overpriced goods.     Michael Douglas displays some hitherto unseen talent as the unbalanced D-FENS, as he casually totes gang weapons (complete with rubber bands on the grips) in his formal shirt and tie, does battle with store owners and comes up against fast food restaurants, homeless people, gangsters and Nazis. RobertDuval is equally brilliant as the desk jockey on his final day, determined to stop anyone else from being hurt, including the perp.     There is, of course, a small amount of Hollywood sentimentality thrown in for good measure, however the dynamics of such a strong narrative make this completely forgivable and it's possible to overlook this as a flaw given the film's overall strengths.     Praise surely has to go to Ebbe Roe Smith for writing one of the finest scripts ever to grace celluloid. Known for bit parts and cameos, who the hell knows who Ebbe really is? Look on IMDb to find out (if you're a geek like me) or release him into the ether if you don't care. The truth is, he's out there. The question is: Where's the next script?     On the whole, Falling Down is a powerful and dramatic indictment of American culture, societal decadence, and the failing values of the West. It's not for everyone and will most certainly offend some, but if approached with an open mind, will provide plenty of fuel for thought. It's a shame though that the DVD doesn't come with any extras (mine didn't, anyway) because there's so much to this film that you just want to know more and more.
B0000508U6|5.0|This is beautiful music.  I distinctly recall direct comparisons to Radiohead at the time of this release, and I must say, I can draw virtually no comparisons between the two artists.  Radiohead stinks.  Radiohead is useless noise.  Coldplay really delivers some beautiful, oftentimes powerful melodies throughout this disc.  Sentimental moments abound here.  Minimalism WORKS when it is executed correctly, and \\"Parachutes\\" is a testament to that.  This album is extremely relaxing and even gives me the chills at times.  Songs like \\"Don't Panic\\", \\"Shiver\\", \\"Sparks\\", and \\"Trouble\\" are tremendous achievements.  Solid album through and through from a terrific band.
B000YPUF9W|2.0|Watching this third installment of Resident Evil is like watching The Empire Strikes Back without having seen any other Star Wars movies.  The T-virus has devastated the world and Alice has escaped from where she was et the end of the second movie.  Everything is dying and there are few remaining survivors.  Alice meets up with a convoy of survivors while the Umbrella Corporation is trying to find her to further their own research.  Alice knows some of the people in the convoy and there is a history.  There are references to events not in the previous movies.  Alice exhibits some new talents.  But in the end it seems like very little has happened or been resolved.  I really enjoyed the first two movies but was at a loss with this one.  I am convinced that in order to appreciate this movie you have to by the two-movie edition of the first films that includes the important linking story.  I wish they had included it with this movie as I don't feel like buying the other two a second time.  This movie is set in the desert and the daylight thus giving it a different feel than the other two.  But it is the lack of a complete story that is its downfall.  With no real beginning or end this is just a snapshot in time.  I can't really recommend this one.

B00003CXZ4|5.0|Memento is a truly complex and engrossing thriller, full of twists and ambiguous peripheral sub-plots which only the most observant of viewers will catch. If you can get interested enough to explore beyond the basic experience, it's as about as cerebral anything committed to celluloid in its depth and deliverance of narrative.     Leonard Shelby has a memory span of around 15 minutes (not a hard and fast rule - this can change dependent on stress) due to Anterograde Amnesia - meaning he can remember the past but cannot make new memories - as the result of head trauma suffered during an attack in which his wife, we are lead to believe, was killed. Now, with only notes and Polaroid pictures to remind himself of what he is doing, he's searching for the killer in order to extract revenge.     Okay, so it's an original story, and it's also really original insofar as it's a plotline which is told in neither a linear or non-linear fashion, but in reverse chronological order, however even beyond that (if you followed it) there's so much more beyond the confines of what we do see and hear, that it leads to an incredibly complex and wonderfully intricate story.     If you only watch it once and understand it completely you're a genius because it's taken me several viewings to get the entire picture. I was also lucky enough to find the \\"Easter Egg\\" (possibly the best Easter Egg on any DVD ever - if anyone knows of a better one, please let me know) and found that even after watching Memento in chronological order, it was still engrossing and deeply intricate.     The special features delve a little deeper into the history of storyline also, giving us some hints and clues as to how Leonard Shelby ended up in the time and place we join him (not to give too much away - but he's an escaped mental patient), and even the special features themselves are cryptic and accessed only through careful examination, analysis and exploration. EVEN THEN, there's a great deal of symbolism (torn out newspaper clippings in the shape of America, references to the nihilistic nature of a life lived without cognisance of actions etc.)     It's clear that writer/director Christopher Nolan invested a lot in this, creating a story that can be disregarded as `decent' or explored as magnificent in its dimensions.     Top marks, and some of the best special features on a DVD, but I can also see how some people wouldn't enjoy it simply because it's not mindless enough. However, if you're an obsessive mind and the sort of person who likes to look beyond the surface, you'll love this film.
B000020617|5.0|This is a great album.  No doubt about it.    The songs are extremely well written, but what has always endeared me to this album is the phenomenal RECORDING.  TINLTL ranks very high amongst my favorite rock recordings by any band, EVER!  Each instrument is balanced perfectly and shines through uninhibited by the others, creating a truly remarkable sound scape.  The drums are rock solid and crystal clear.  The guitars jangle with remarkable clarity and Grohl's ever-improving voice has never sounded better.  Some of the more recent FF albums have suffered quite a bit from muddy recording techniques, in my bold opinion.   However, it also helps that this collection of songs is amongst the best you'll find on any rock album from this era.    While this album can be considered the FF's foray into pop rock, there is still plenty of crunch and plenty of that unmistakable trademark Grohl loud/soft dynamic.  \\"Generator\\", \\"Aurora\\", and \\"Headwires\\" are a few unheralded standout tracks.  BUY THIS!
B000Y7U98W|5.0|Incredible to behold in high definition, Sunshine sets high expectations with the ambitious plot and lives up to them marvellously, albeit in a more \\"movie-ish\\" manner that sci-fi connoisseurs could distaste.  Things must go wrong in this mission to make it a movie.  As much as I didn't like the way they happened, (poor judgement by captain), I still found myself immensely entertained by the suspensful scrambles of the crew to overcome these obstacles and by the visual style of Danny Boyle.  Sunshine ends as an allegory on humans and god with extremists on both sides creating an enthralling climax.  Should men alter the course of nature to prevent his own demise?  When considering an event of extreme magnitude, (like the sun dying), the answer could become more controversial for religious fundamentalists.   The visual, suspenseful, and philosophical elements kept my interest after dismissing the scientific validity of the plot.  My remote scientific knowledge does contain the fact that the sun will outlive humans by billions of years so I decided to not question the circumstances of these astronauts and let the film's virtues shine.  And they shined ever so brightly.
0452289963|5.0|I have never read a book that had the full scope of our human condition,  and the reality of what is going on.  This is that book.  This is a book that can help you in your awakening.

Anybody who \\"knocks\\" this book and doesn't see its value, obviously isn't ready for that transformation.

B000GDH9JQ|4.0|A movie with ballet - but not a ballet movie! The opening scene showing Mikhail Baryshnikov's mind-blowing dance piece against turbulent orchestral music sets the scene for a serious, complex movie. He plays Nikolai Rochenko, a Russian deserter who defected to America but crash-lands back in the Motherland (some of the best air-crash footage I've ever seen).    Stuck back in communist Soviet Union, he tries to escape back to the USA but is thwarted by Colonel Chaiko and a bugged apartment. Enlisting the help of Gregory Hines (who is amazingly radiant in this movie) and Nikolai's ex-girlfriend Galina (played by a wonderful Helen Mirren), together they try to escape during the sun-lit night of a Russian Summer. This movie was also Isabella Rossellini's first dramatic role and she is sublime as Raymond's Russian wife.    This movie will not disappoint - with drama, suspense and some of the best dance moves on film, it is a wonderfully satisfying film.

0743298039|5.0|That's probably the longest title I've ever written for a review, but I think it sums up this book (and review) rather well. \\"The Thirteenth Tale\\" is this interesting, creepy, almost ghost story but real, Gothic-style (as everyone is so quick to call it) book that glides along smoothly (and a tad bit slowly, because of the elegance) and will provide readers with a fascinating tale. Whew. A lot of words.<br /><br />What's not to like? Some readers may be put off by the slow feel. Stories within stories written eloquently and beautifully that build up slowly and carefully to an ultimate point may not be for all. One needs a certain level of appreciation for the classics (such as \\"Jane Eyre\\", one of the themes in this book) and the ability to read books that believe in telling the whole story in order to like this book. But for those who do, it's so easy to fall in love.<br /><br />I liked \\"The Thirteenth Tale\\" quite a bit. I found the plot twists intriguing and the writing clear and well done. I, interestingly enough, was not bored by the book at all, and in fact could not put it down. I see how others might not like this book, with the air of mystery, the occasional disturbing parts (creepy or just frightening), and the overall old-fashioned air, but on the whole the book impresses. It's just kind of cool and yes - I enjoyed reading it. It's a good book.<br /><br />It's not a book for all, but it's a pretty solid, comfortable recommendation to those who think an interesting, dark tale will be perfect for the night.
B0015HS5TA|3.0|When I first saw the trailers for this film, I thought, \\"Oh no, not another _My Fair Lady_.\\"    \\"Miss Pettigrew Lives For A Day\\" is a whole lot more than the 'fix her up to catch a man films' that get sold to the public on a daily basis.  What ends up happening is that Miss Pettigrew (Frances McDormand) and Delysia Lafosse (Amy Adams) end up teaming up to help each other.  You see, the unattractive failed nanny who's been eating out of soup kitchens and the lovely ingenue inhabiting a wealthy man's penthouse while she juggles two other boyfriends have more in common than you would think.     \\"Miss Pettigrew\\" takes place on the first day of the London Blitz, so add pre-war tensions, and you've got an interesting film on more than one level.  Don't get me wrong, the film's still predictable and light, but it does both quite adequately for a snowy afternoon. If you enjoy that time-frame's costumes, music, and just a dash of history (not enough, sadly) this is a film worth catching.

You'll want to cry.<br /><br />7. Every chapter reveals a portion of the picture. It shows you a bit of your own life (especially for teenagers, but also for adults). It reminds you of things you'd forgotten, and points out things you never thought could hurt another.<br /><br />8. Teens will relate. Because in every character is a part of you or someone you know. Readers will find people they know among these characters and walk away from this incredible book all the wiser.<br /><br />9. I read this in one intense sitting, desperate to hear the whole story. I didn't want to miss a thing, didn't want to lose a clue. It felt like I was walking around town, headphones clamped over my ears, listening to a girl's final story.<br /><br />10. You just have to read it.<br /><br />11. I think what I liked most about this book was that it accurately described teenagers, depression, and a person's loneliness. Hannah may have taken things to the extreme with her ultimate end, but it is so honest and true.<br /><br />12. I loved every part of this book. I found myself absolutely taken with every aspect of it, unable to put it down and incapable of thinking of anything else. It sucked me in from the first page and still has me enraptured.<br /><br />13. But it's just so, so important. And that's what's heartbreaking in the end. Hannah's tale is, sadly enough, one of many. Clay, listening to these tapes, finds himself thinking often \\"I should have...\\" at so many small things. Things like he should have noticed.

B00005JKG5|5.0|This movie is probably considered a chick flick, but it's more than that.  It has great music and really fun dance scenes.  The 2 plots lines are very good.

0061122416|2.0|Or, to be more accurate, one that does not bestow flattery. Because for me, there is little in this book that particularly enchanted, charmed, or even made for an enjoyable read. Why? The following reasons:<br /><br />\\"The Alchemist\\" is written extraordinarily simply. Now, perhaps along will jump a fan to say, \\"Well, of course! Therein lies the beauty!\\" But I say, \\"No.\\" While sometimes books DO manage to pull of the \\"beautiful simplicity\\", \\"The Alchemist\\" simply does not. The writing is bland and flat. The dialogue is pretentious and frustrating. Most of all, though, I found myself rather bored. The writing did not amaze.<br /><br />The plot, meanwhile, remained at the same level. Mostly because there wasn't much of one. It's an intriguing story, I'll grant you that (thus the two-star rating), but not much more. I didn't like a lot of the messages thrown in, didn't appreciate having many thoughts rammed down my throat ten-thousand times, and I really didn't like the character. \\"The boy's name was Santiago.\\" So why is it that I had to turn back to the first page in order to remember it? Why did he impress me least of all, with his blandness?<br /><br />What, I must wonder, is it that draws others? I have no idea. I didn't like the messages constantly rammed down my throat, the odd connections Coelho made, and the seemingly non-existent plot. I found myself bored by the writing style after the first few pages, annoyed by certain things (his love - he loves her for absolutely no reason. Also, his whiny attitude grew annoying), and utterly unimpressed.<br /><br />A fantastic tale? No. At least Coelho kept this odd read short. I did not particularly enjoy it and would not recommend it. Either I'm missing something, or everybody else just failed to see what I saw in this not-so-great book.
B000K7VHQE|1.0|I looked through my pile of unwatched DVDs looking for something bright, original and warm.  You have got to be kidding!  Little Miss Sunshine is vile, hateful and is populated with NOTHING but cardboard stereotypes.  I was hoping for characters that were quirky but ultimately loveable.  The screenwriter and director think that pornography, the F-word uttered in front of a 7 yr old and yelling arguments are \\"hillarious\\" as some reviewers have deemed this film.  I was looking for something bright and truely insightful and funny with the viewing of this film.  Instead it made me physically ill not so much because it was such an ugly hateful film but because so many people have bought into the hype of whatever other people tell you is good is therefore good.  Very, very disturbing...

As for the live dvd, the story speaks for itself, going onstage in the wee hours in the morning has its downsides but you get to see Joe perform with the cards(no sleep) stacked against him, with a crowd that seemed to care less. Glad I'm here to experience the performance and appreciate it!

Duran Duran reinvent themselves every album and this one is no exception. Givin that it does not have that new romantic feel, it still delivers a dynamic that true Duran Duran fans will appreciate.   being a fan of d/d since the 80s i have followed them from the top to the bottom and back again, i have always been a fan of their b songs more than their a songs, however unlike astronaut and poptrash the essence of darkness isnt there, with tracks like box o honey and skin divers the general question is huh?. if you look back even in the days of notorious and liberty you can feel a certian essence of oh whats the word..oh yeah lack of feeling, however this album isnt without its good tracks, tempted is a nice catchy tune and falling down is probley the best work on the album, but of you are looking for the dark romantic duran duran you wont find it on this album.

I found the book uplifting and adding the webcast with Eckhart Tolle and Oprah was definatley an enjoyable addition.

0446401307|5.0|The thing about the Harry Bosch series is that there isn't a book in it that is bad. The characters are some of the best conceived, real, and evil that are out there. It has to be considered one of the best of the LA crime fiction series ever.  It is up there with Marlowe.  As a fan,  it would be nice to see about fifty more books about Harry Bosch.  There is room for it too.  The series started in the late middle of Harry's career, it mentions Vietnam, his earlier LAPD ventures, the youth halls.  That would all make some very interesting novels.  What we are witnessing with the lastest three novels is the autumn of Harry's life.  While necessary to keep the series fresh, it is  so sad.  This is one that you just don't want to see die.

0446401307|3.0|Connelly's recent novels have suffered increasingly from a sense of their being the pro forma efforts of a writer who has become a brand name and is feeling less and less creatively invested in his work. I was initially drawn  to Connelly's novels because they were simply the most literate and intelligent mystery/crime fiction novels I had encountered in many years.  The police background felt convincing and well-observed. And at his best, Connelly can write with Chandleresque resonance and construct moments of haunting prose that transcend the genre.    But THE OVERLOOK is a slight effort betraying its serialized roots.  Connelly's prose is clean and servicable, but nowhere near some of his earlier efforts.  And, for the first time with a Connelly mystery, I guessed the ending early in the novel and I suspect many other mystery readers will as well.

006135323X|4.0|If you had to sit through Econ 101 in college, you'll love this little book because it confirms those sneaking suspicions you had all along about the validity of economic theory in the real world. Guess what? That overpaid tweedy professor up front was way off the mark with his \\"rational consumer\\" model and neatly intersecting lines. We often DON'T act in our best interests...for a variety of interesting reasons.<br /><br />Kudos to MIT professor Dan Ariely for documenting this phenomenon in a highly amusing, easy-to-read format. His book is a welcome addition to the growing library of popular econo-psych-ology texts that includes \\"The Tipping Point\\" by Malcolm Gladwell, \\"Freakonomics\\" by Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner, and \\"The Wisdom of Crowds\\" by James Surowiecki. What a great time to be alive if you're interested in this fascinating topic.<br /><br />Let's start with sex. Ariely conducted an experiment that demonstrates the dramatic effect of sexual arousal on our decision-making process. Volunteers (all college-age men) rated their willingness to engage in specific sexual acts -- with data collected on two separate occasions. The first set of answers was collected WITHOUT sexual arousal. The second set was collected WITH arousal (use your imagination here, fellas). Turns out that arousal had a measurable, predictable affect on their decisions...often in direct conflict with their best (i.e., \\"rational\\") interests.<br /><br />For example, volunteers who were definitely against unprotected sex with a new partner became MUCH more willing to take this risk as they became aroused. Ditto for a wide range of other sexual acts and situations (e.g., sleeping with someone over 50). Some of these results where downright shocking. The implications for sex education and HIV prevention are compelling.<br /><br />Ariely applies this same method to other forms of irrational consumer behavior, such as our willingness to buy more merchandise than we really want if \\"free shipping\\" is included, and the so-called \\"decoy effect\\" that retailers use to stimulate sales. Other chapters focus on honesty in test-taking, household saving rates, real estate buyers, credit cards, employer-employee loyalty and even dating.<br /><br />I haven't seen the raw data or survey methodology used in Ariely's various experiments, and other reviewers have pointed out a few holes in his approach. But keep in mind that \\"Predictably Irrational\\" was written for a popular audience. It's an intelligent conversation starter -- not a Ph.D. thesis or peer-reviewed journal article.<br /><br />At the end of the day, this is one terrific read with an important message for all of us: Our decisions are deeply influenced by non-rational influences and attitudes. And if you don't believe that, just check the latest news on the housing collapse. Bravo, Mr. Ariely...I can hardly wait for his next book!so-called \\"decoy effect\\" that retailers use to stimulate sales.

B0011NVC98|1.0|Like any modern moviegoer, I value good to excellent storytelling, special effects, and acting. There is not much else as entertaining as a good action film. Unfortunately, that is not the goal or result of this film, which is the primary reason why I did not enjoy it. The storytelling was not good, neither the special effects, nor the acting regardless of the BIG names involved. I have seen better work from all of these individuals. However, there is something of deeper value to this film that should be examined. Many have noted this movie is not \\"Beowulf\\" as the title suggests, but rather it is a parody of Beowulf. It is common knowledge that film makers tend to re-interpret works for various reasons. Parody serves an important function in the world. Writers have always used it to examine current political, social, and religious concepts. It is a safe way to comment on the reigning people and values in a culture. It has been the practice to reinterpret works when there is motivation in a culture to do so. Therefore, Works tend to reflect the conflicts present in the culture that creates them. There are motivations present in our culture that allow a re-interpretation of the values in Beowulf to take such a negative direction. It is important to realize that, currently, there is right-wing leadership in our nation that very closely resembles the figures portrayed in this version of Beowulf. Currently, the people in leadership are touting their own perfection and complaining about the undeserving OTHERS they so obviously detest. Unfortunately, current leaders have been repeatedly shown through their actions to be vainglorious liars, drunks, and fornicators. However much they may pretend to be righteous, they are not. Approval ratings for this group of leadership is at historic lows, for any group of American leaders, for good reason. Basically, they are the antithesis of the values set forth in the Beowulf manuscript. These values, honesty, bravery, love, and noblesse oblige, are the underpinnings of a moral society. Though very old, the values presented in the elder Beowulf manuscript are the basis for a democratic society based on law and order (Our early American government is quite similar to Iceland's Althing - though there are some differences). That is why you will find numerous reviews of this film, in which the reviewers react so negatively toward this film's portrayal of Beowulf's heroes. The reaction is strong because, as Americans, we highly value these ideals. We are essentially good people. At this time in our culture, the values set forth in the Beowulf manuscript are under attack. People are greiving the loss of innocence and goodness in modern American culture. This work heavily underscores that loss (note that this film is rated PG 13 instead of R) and is, unfortunately, even sadly, timely. It makes no difference if the film makers are republican or democrat, Christian, Jewish, or Pagan, or if the intent was purposeful or accidental, the result is the same. This film reflected the decline in the morality of our nation's leadership the moment this negative portrayal of Beowulf was conceived and executed.
0716703440|5.0|I have had access to this book for only about a month. Most physics-oriented books mix abstractness with errors, making their books of less value than being useless.

The book \\"Gravitation\\" by Wheeler, Thorne, etc. is the best book I have seen both from the viewpoint of the mathematics, as well as Physics. Hoever, I still suggest using the book \\"Gravitation\\" with the books by Spain, Sokolnikoff, and Civita by your side (as a double check). I also suggest books that provide more comprehensive coverage of subjects such as Manifold theory and the Calculus of Variations, and even a book or two dealing with Differential Geometry.
B00003ZKS1|5.0|At the height of his prowess in 1979 Michael Schenker acrimoniously split from UFO.  He had just given the note perfect performance of the century on the best live album ever made and then decided to disappear! I feared the worst for the unpredictable German genius that was and still is my favourite guitar player. Then came The Michael Schenker Group album, his first attempt as a solo artist and still probably the best. Although not really a group at all this is a classic, period!!  The album featured the rock find of the decade in Gary Barden on vocals along with the finest session musicians of the period (Simon Phillips on drums, Mo Foster on bass and the legendary Don Airey on keys)     There are obvious parallels with UFO where Schenker was a creative force, yet this is altogether an edgier guitar-indulgent album that compensates for the loss of Mogg's lyrical mastery. The album is still rammed full of great rock songs laced everywhere with technically brilliant lead guitar work that never forsakes the melody or compromises the song structure. Lost Horizons is awesomely mesmerizing and moody, Armed & Ready is straight ahead power chord rock, Tales of Mystery has beautiful acoustic tones and a real gem of a lead break, Feel's Like a Good Thing has great interchanges with Barden, in fact every track has plenty on offer. It goes without saying that the musicianship is excellent, all wrapped up in a solid production job by Roger Glover. Schenker was by far the best guitarist on the scene in 1980. If you like lead guitar based rock and roll rather than the strumity-strum stuff of today then this is for you.

B00005JNNZ|5.0|Samuel L is one of the greatest of all time. A powerful & very touching movie that gives a good & very realistic view of life for the neglected societies. Yes, yes yes!
0613035976|2.0|Read this book because of all the great reviews. Good world but really need more info as to how the bells etc and how all the creepy people work. Characters are flat and there doesn't ssem to be enough people in the world to flesh out the reality. Wouldn't recommend it and won't read the next one. May not even try to read any other of Nix's books. I am an adult and read a lot of fantasy.
0767803434|5.0|Everyone knows by now that this movie is about an American president (played by Harrison Ford) who must fight for the lives of his family and staff on an Air Force One that has been taken over by terrorists. It's a great movie; I had seen it on TV one weekend and had to buy it.<br /><br />But here's the thing: the product description is not quite right. While this DVD is fullscreen, it's not the 1.85:1 that's it is said to be. I know, a truly minor, even nitpicky little  thing, but some people actually worry over such things. I do. I was happy to find that this *is* actually fullscreen which it wouldn't have been if the product description was right about the aspect ratio.<br /><br />'Ron
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|Unlike many \\"directors cuts\\" which are released primarily to squeeze more money out of the consumer, this version is Scott's vision brought to full glory and it is a must see for anyone who likes either spectacles or just great filmmaking. As is sadly the case with many big budget films, the producers have cut Scott's original film and greatly reduced it's impact as shown in theaters. Now, with this version, the whole feel of the piece is different. There are many questions answered here that left one wondering just how it was that a blacksmith knew the art of war. I won't give away these scenes, but I will leave it be said that the first thirty minutes of the film is a rich and well laid out foundation for what is to follow.     It is also worth noting here, that unlike many critics reviews, this film is NOT just an excuse for large scale battle scenes and carnage, but rather a carefully crafted and craftily thought out parable for our own times.  It is essential to watching this film to realize that history unknown is history to be repeated, yes. Scott is one of only a few master film makers active today, and part of his genius is he understands character, plot, and most of all has an amazingly complete grasp of what makes great cinema. The only thing that ever stops Scott from making great films is a lack of great scripts.     I would rate this film among the great epics ever made, alongside such films as BEN HUR, ZULU, GLADIATOR, and a hand full of others. What separates this film from most other large scale action dramas, is that it contains a complex view of competing religious and moral stands. And, nlike many spectacles, this film uses spectacle to make a salient point about the religious and moral dilemmas of our own time. Unlike other films where the spectacle BECOMES the point, Scott utilizes huge battle scenes not for an almost pornographic blood letting, but uses these scenes as extremely graphic demonstrations of the consequences of war. He uses the venue of an historical epic to illustrate the unending moral upheaval that has marked all of human history, between those who want tolerance, and those whose fanaticism to a moral or religious dogma blinds them and has been the cause of countless deaths and suffering.     That is what makes this film great and also makes it challenging to viewers; it presents two sides to a very heated topic, rather than giving a simplistic view of one side being evil and the other good.     Great films are always parables that intend to illuminate the present through the past. In that sense, Scott has  again triumphed in this compelling and complex film.    If anyone can watch this film without being moved by it, and made to question one's own views, that one's heart is made of stone.

B0010YSD7M|4.0|I guess I got it early from Amazon, but watched it today.    First of all, I'm a fan so pretty much unless it was a total bomb, I was going to like it...    Hopefully, without giving anything away, it was a good story.  Satisfying closure? to the Ori thread, IOA back making things harder for the SG-1, and somewhat corny at the end, but I liked it.    On a sidenote, I enjoyed the extras, ie. the SD Comic Con highlights were funny...
B000HT3P7E|4.0|\\"How I Met Your Mother\\" is a wonderfully heartwarming and humorous show rehashing the courtships and surroundings of a late 20s early 30s man named Ted Mosby as part of an overarching story arc of a future Ted Mosby recounting to his future children regarding how he met their mother.    The stories are wonderfully shot, and brilliantly rounded by a diverse set of characters played by Alyson Hannigan, Cobie Smulders, Jason Segel, Neil Patrick Harris, and Josh Radnor.  The individual episodes are cleverly linked and tied together, with foreshadowing and callbacks ranging through complete seasons.  The writing is punchy, and the humor is tailored to easily fit with each character, never feeling force.  It's enjoyable, heartfelt, and intelligent.    However, the transfer to DVD has one small problem and one really big problem in it, from my point of view.    Small problem is the menu system does not allow for consecutive playing of the episodes without returning to the menu.  I consider this feature a must for TV shows transferred to DVD.    The biggest problem I have is that they changed much of the scoring and music selections within the shows.  Instead of containing the songs and music from the broadcasts, they have been replaced by unknown and less evocative music.  For example, in the episode \\"Drumroll Please\\" they replaced \\"You Don't Knom Me\\" by Michael Buble for this heartwrenching romantic scene with some neutral generic waltz music...detracting from the scene considerably.  In the same episode, the final scene was originally done to Pavement's \\"Spit on a Stranger\\" which brought lovely color and climax to the finale of the episode, but on the DVD, it was another generic piece of music.  I imagine these were cost saving measures to prevent paying royalties, but it lessens the greatness of the show...and the show really is great.    For this transgression, I have penalized the DVD one star for taking a great show and not keeping it intact during the transfer to DVD.
B000JVT09C|4.0|As blasphemous as it might be to say it, I like this cast, this director, this film a good deal more than the original. Metropolis feels like it did in the 1930's cartoons. Superman flies and soars as he never has. Lois Lane is bitchy, as she should be. Lex Luthor is perfectly sinister. But I think jimmy is the best cast of them all, personally.    This is a film to add to your blu-ray collection for sure. No questions asked. It may not be the perfect film but it is beautiful to look at and well acted. Brian Singer gave up X-Men 3 to do this one and I think it shows. X-Men 3 was awful and Superman Returns was excellent.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|Boston's 1976 self-titled debut is a masterpiece that all classic rock fans need to own. The late Brad Delp's vocals shine throughout the whole record, and Tom Scholz's keyboards and guitars are great as well.    If you've never heard of Boston before do check this record out. It's a landmark record. And while I love 'Don't Look Back,' that record can't hold a candle to this one.    Highlights are the underrated 'Hitch A Ride,' 'More Than A Feeling,' 'Foreplay/Long Time,' 'Smokin'' and 'Let Me Take You Home Tonight.'    This is highly recommended for any Boston or rock and roll fan. A true masterpiece.    ENJOY!!!
B0011HOEY4|4.0|I'm not going to give a synopsis of the movie, plenty of that here already. I'll just give my thoughts. I thought it was a good movie and showed the corruption that goes on within the police as well as what people will do for money. The acting was good by both Denzel and Crowe, however neither performance was as good as several of their other movies. The DVD quality of this is poor and a lot of chroma and blocking and poor black backgrounds. Its frustrating that they can make some DVDs with crisp clean transfers and others like this one with poor quality. Soundwise it was excellent and should do well on any 5.1 or 7.1 system. Overall a must-see.
1563894696|5.0|The Long Halloween is a masterpiece.  The premise of the story is that a serial killer is taking down the mob, one gangster at a time.  This killer has a unique method, killing on holidays, therefore the killer is called Holiday.  Batman, Gordon and Harvey Dent make a pact to discover the identity of Holiday and to stop the killing.  However, the identity of the killer is not so easily discovered, and many gangsters die.    The tone of this story arc is dark, which suits Batman very well, without being overbearing.  Batman spends more time trying to figure out the identity of Holiday than punching out villains, so you really get a sense of Batman as a detective.  However, there are various chances for Batman to show his skills--the best of which is a midair battle with Joker.  This is recommended for all Batman fans and is a must have.
B0004Z33EQ|4.0|After the first Rambo film 1982`s \\"First Blood\\" which reached a certain success with the audience,Stallone returned as John Rambo in \\"First Blood Part II\\" in 1985.This sequel is often remembered more than the original Rambo,who was based on David Morrell`s \\"First Blood\\" novel but was entirely rewritten for a movie but still keeping many of the basic elements of the book.Stallone gave us once again a great action movie that he can be proud of and that we can enjoy over and over again.It was filmed entirely in Mexico,not that it really matters,i just tought i`d add that in for extra information.It certainly has it`s own story and doesn`t copy the first at all,add to that it has even more violence than the first film.It seems that with each Rambo movies the more violence they have and that was proven to me with this one,\\"Rambo III\\"(1988) and \\"Rambo\\"(2008).<br /><br />In \\"First Blood Part II\\" Rambo is currently serving five years in prison for his acts in \\"First Blood\\" at the beggening of the movie,until he gets released by Colonel Trautman if he accepts the mission the colonel gives him.As you could or should have guessed he accepted.Rambo must head for the P.O.W camp he escaped from in 1971 in order to find out if there are still some P.O.W.`s held in the camp.If he succeds he will be pardonned from jail and once again be a free man.Rambo does find many american hostages there and you can expect plenty of action from there.He must face many dangers that are very real.He also meets a young vietnamese girl whom he has a good relationship(not sexually)with and they become good friends.There are some flashback scenes from Rambo`s past in which he was tortured by the ennemies and we see how he got that big cut on his chest.I don`t want to give way the movie in every single details but there is plenty of action,killing,guns and other materials that can be 1)cool or 2)offensive depending of you,but be aware that all these aspects are in the film.<br /><br />The special features.It is known already that the movie itself is incredible as well as a must see classic.The features from previous releases are gone for

1582701709|3.0|of course, skepticism to things that could help you is the very attitude that the book is trying to discourage.    my advice is - have a healthy balance of skepticism and faith.  the principles in this book are universal and the book does a great job in reminding us of that.  albeit, in a style that's exaggerated that it is almost laughable.      they must have paid all those resource person sums of money for them to say those absolutes.  and that is, why, you the buyer paid a pretty steep price as well for buying something that's repetitive, preachy and attracts by way of hype and nice paper.    bottomline though, did it help the readers?  if so, then the book serves its purpose, regardless of how it was written.
B000C1ZXEU|1.0|I appreciated Adichie's exploration into the everyday of a traditional Nigerian family; it is easy to form a picture in one's mind.  However, I expected more.  I came away thinking and feeling \\"is this it?\\".  The book seemed to lack a certain substance.    Anyhow, I am proud of her accomplishments and have her other book \\"Half of a Yellow Sun\\" waiting to be read.  I hope it is better!
B0006IIPIK|4.0|\\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\" is a masterpiece.  The movie was made with a blue screen, and the backgrounds were added.  They could have chosen to give a totally surreal feel to it as you have with the Batman series or \\"Dick Tracy\\", but it fit the setting perfectly.<br /><br />I would call this the 2000 attempt of \\"Raiders Of The Lost Ark\\".  There are many similarities between the two pictures, such as the time setting, the homage to 40's serials, the action, having a foreign sidekick, one graphic horrific death scene toward the end, and even having some of the action in Nepal.  This movie also borrowed from other action movies including Jurassic Park.<br /><br />This movie was very well done, but I actually didn't like it.  A movie like that is of course a time waster, but this one made me feel the time was wasted.<br /><br />One drawback is that the target audience seems to be an under thirty viewer who enjoys 40's movies.  This movie captures the 40's films even more effectively than Raiders, and that may be its undoing.  For this person who is more at home in the '70's and '80's, I found this movie in some ways before my time and in other ways after my time.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|This show gets better and better with every season. It is one of the most intelligent and compelling shows I've ever seen. Season 3 continues the story of the Winchester brothers, it's riveting, it's scary and it's a MUST SEE!
0452289963|5.0|The book was delivered promptly and in excellent shape. I would definitely buy from them again.
0609610570|2.0|Execution is one of the popular business books of 2002. I sometimes refer to this kind of books as \\"airport books\\" since airports have stacks of them and thats where most business people seem to buy them.<br /><br />Execution was recommended to me as a book that really gets to the root of many organizational dysfunction. After reading the book, I tend to disagree. Execution does make some good points, but it's surprisingly not very concrete for a title which suggests concreteness.<br /><br />The book describes how moderns leaders \\"get things done\\" through the three processes in a company: the strategy process, the people process and the operations process. The authors argue that in many organizations \\"execution\\" is lacking because the three core processes are not performed well and are not well linked together. It gives examples of businesses where this was the case and counter examples of businesses which, according to them, execute well (like GM and Enron...)<br /><br />To me, the book was way too much \\"leader focused\\" and not real enough. It had a lot of blah blah about good leaders should do this and that, while much of it was not really concrete. I do not think I got any idea from this book which I would be able to execute.<br /><br />The one thing about the book I DID like was it's focus on getting the right people and educating them correctly. The book, again and again, states that having the right people is essential in well run companies. Though, after that, the amount of stuff about rewarding was, in my opinion, not very good.<br /><br />My conclusion is that the book is ok to read. I think I would not recommend it to anyone, but it wasn't a complete waste of time. I did expected a lot more. So, better leave it at the airport and pick up another airport book.
B000WCBPOG|1.0|True Beatles fans (like me), who know their catalog like the back of their hand will absolutely abhor this CD. The film itself was not in the least designed for meaningful content that does justice to The Beatles or their music, but to use the medium of film to manipulate the best music of all time to make millions of dollars, which it has certainly done.  Furthermore, the covers were absolutely horrid! I watched the film with a group of people, and the music was so embarrassing to me that I honestly blushed through the entire thing. In addition to being completely lacking in quality or imagination, they were taken completely out of context. By transfixing The Beatles' music with certain images and events, it attempts to define the songs and/or demonstrate a clear-cut interpretation of them, which is wholly unwarranted. For example, Strawberry Fields Forever is about growing up and developing an identity, not the frustration of some artist who just happens to be working with strawberries. Note: When Bono sang \\"I am the Walrus,\\" part of me died inside.  In short, this CD is supreme blasphemy to The Beatles, their music, and their fans, and is only designed to greedily take advantage of the best music of all time for the purpose of making a ton of money. One can see from reading the other reviews that those who are ignorant of The Beatles are the ones who like it. Get real. You need to listen to this CD like you need to experience death by audio stimulation (or lack thereof).    P.S. To appreciate this film you must be ignorant about The Beatles and their music. To those who profess to be fans, that's impossible.
B000PTYPAC|5.0|Having never heard any of Paramore's music and being constantly baraged by a friend to get this album and give them a try I took the leap. There's only one thing to say when referring to this album and the band altogether, they're the future of rock music and Hayley Williams has a bright future ahead of her.<br /><br />Very rarely I listen to an album in its entirety and enjoy every song as much as the last. To compare Paramore to No Doubt is ridiculous, No Doubt are of a completely different genre of music to Paramore and let me say Paramore are much better.<br /><br />If you were to compare Paramore to a popular female musician the only one that could come close to comparing to Hayley Williams would be Avril Lavigne. Although I wouldn't expect Hayley Williams to sell out to the pop princess image. Long may Paramore have a very successful and prestigious career and this album is an excellent stepping stone to greatness.
B000ZLFALI|1.0|True Beatles fans (like me), who know them and their catalog like the back of their hand will absolutely abhor this film. When watching the previews it looks great, in concept and in style, but nothing could be further from the truth.<br />Like I said, the idea of a musical featuring covers of Beatles songs throughout, and amalgamated with the turmoil of the 60's would/should have been great, but this film goes about it the wrong way. One can easily tell from the all too conspicuous lack of a plot (more so than in any movie or musical I have ever seen) that the film was not in the least designed for meaningful content that does justice to The Beatles or their music, but to use the medium of film to manipulate the best music of all time to make millions of dollars, which it has certainly done.<br />Furthermore, the covers were absolutely horrid! I watched this film with a group of people, and the music was so embarrassing to me that I blushed through the entire thing.

By transfixing The Beatles' music with certain images and events, it attempts to define the songs and/or demonstrate a clear-cut interpretation of them, which is wholly unwarranted. Also, the film is riddled with myriad disjunctions and arbitrary events so as to pump it full of mediocre-at-best performances. Note: When Bono sang \\"I am the Walrus,\\" part of me died inside.<br />In short, this film is supreme blasphemy to The Beatles, their music, and their fans, and is only designed to greedily take advantage of the best music of all time for the purpose of making a ton of money.

B000TLYEEI|5.0|I'm sorry, but I can't believe anyone who listens to this album can't get into it, also it boggles my mind that anyone can put this album down just because Tarja Turunen isn't the vocalist anymore! In my opinion, I actually like Anette Olzon's vocals better than Tarja's. Now when I say that I'm not saying that one singer is better than the other because they ARE BOTH TALENTED, but I prefer Anette's style more because I feel Tarja's vocals are often too strong for this kind of music. I just think Anette's vocals fit metal music more. Anyway, other than that I feel that this new album not only opens a new chapter in Nightwish's magnificent history, but also exceeds anything they've done before...it's heavy, dark & beautiful...everything you can ask for!
B0011NVC9I|1.0|Robert Zemeckis said that he hated the original story of Beowulf. Then why did he waste his time and ours making this movie? Why doesn't he spend his time making something he does like and stop trying to redo a literary classic. About the only thing this movie has in common with the original story is the title. There are two reasons this movie was made: 1) To show off CGI effects (which could have been better and still look artificial); 2) to show off Angelina Jolie in a supposedly nude scene as Grendel's mother and Boewulf's seductress. I'm sure pre-pubescent boys everywhere got excited at the thought. Of course, as Hollywood is constantly reminding us, she's irresistible, isn't she and all grown men with a brain or not can't resist her can they? Just once I'd like to see a movie where the guy isn't a complete moron and doesn't fall for it. And of course they leave the ending of the movie with the possibility of a sequel just in case it's a success and they can make a sequel and lots more money from the teenage movie audience for whom these types of movies are made for. Rent it or download it, but don't waste your money buying it. Better yet, skip it altogether.

0060558121|3.0|I'm a fan. The more I travel around the US, the more I enjoy this book. But, I also had a strong knee jerk reaction to some characters--do you know who's reading your books, Neil? How familiar do you think they are with Norse mythology? I felt like I wasn't supposed to catch on right away to who certain characters were supposed to represent, but dude--I love you, but not for your subtly.
B0011FXLCC|5.0|Goldfrapp has easily become my favourite music group.  Each album they do is unique, and they seem to get better with each release.      Seventh Tree is the mellow follow-up to 2006's electro-disco breakthrough Supernature.  Their last release was a true stunner, with catchy dance songs that were popular in clubs, and of all things, t.v. commercials.    Fans who loved Supernature may be disappointed by Seventh Tree's folky, laid-back mood.  But it's a perfect follow-up to that album.  While Supernature is the party album, Seventh Tree is the after party album, yet just as entrancing.  Goldfrapp has a knack for creating moody, atmospheric, enhanced by Alison Goldfrapp's ethereal vocals.  This is one album you will want to keep playing because it is so enigmatic.  Brilliant.
B000FA5QEK|3.0|I enjoyed this book (I bought it for my kindle, which is awesome) but enjoy Dave Ramsey's books much more.  This seems to repeat the same things over and over.  It mainly talks about taking chances and that we must \\"be our own boss\\" before we will ever be able to have financial freedom.  It reiterates again and again that we will not have wealth without being afraid we will lose it unless we are our own bosses.  This is wonderful and great but I just like the tone of the Dave Ramsey books better.  He focuses a lot on values and putting family first and is a Christian, which I love.  This book doesn't do that at all.  It just talks about taking a risk and being your own boss.
B000VNMMR0|1.0|This is without a doubt one of the worst films I have ever seen. A tired, lazy procession of cliches which lacks even a fraction of the flair or imagination of any of its predecessors. What Bruce Willis was thinking when he signed up for this God only knows; next time an A-list action movie star announces that he only signed up to revive a well-worn franchise \\"because the script was right\\", you should go ahead and assume they got the word \\"script\\" confused with the word \\"money\\". I just wish for once they would be honest about it and save everybody's time.     The film itself is merely a succession of highly improbable action set pieces joined together by clunky expositional dialogue and interrupted by moments of abject boredom. The sequence where Bruce engages in hand-to-hand combat with a fighter jet (yes, really) is just plain ludicrous. Maggie Q's henchwoman(she's Asian, so of course she is an expert martial artist) must have been a terminator, it's the only way to explain why she took so long to die. Timothy Olyphant's villain must rank as the dullest screen villian in living memory; he was given literally NOTHING interesting to say or do. Oh, wait, I think he kicked a chair once. He was angry, you see. Not as angry as I was at the thought that the two hours of my life I wasted watching this drivel are now lost forever. And if I see one more pretty estranged daughter in peril/daddy's coming to save the day/I love you daddy subplot I will puke. Can whoever thinks this is an interesting dramatic device please just STOP ALREADY.     In summary, if I wanted to spend two hours watching things get smashed up I'd visit my local junkyard on crushing day. Everyone involved in this limp excuse for a movie should hang their heads in shame.
0230531423|4.0|Jeffrey Archer's \\" A Prisoner of Birth\\" opens on a cheerful note.  An East-Ender named Danny Cartwright gets down on one knee and proposes to his pregnant girlfriend, Beth Wilson, who happily accepts.  Bernie, Beth's brother and Danny's best mate, joins the happy couple at a pub to celebrate.  The revelry ends abruptly when four drunken men pick a fight with Bernie and Danny, who depart with Beth to avoid a row.  Unfortunately, the three are confronted by their antagonists and a vicious brawl ensues, leaving Bernie dead and Danny arrested for his murder.  Although Danny's conscientious young attorney, Alex Redmayne, does his best to defend his client (who refuses to plead guilty to a lesser charge of manslaughter), the four men from the pub, who call themselves the Musketeers, concoct a bogus but credible story and stick with it.<br /><br />The actual killer is Spencer Craig who, ironically, is a barrister specializing in criminal law.  Craig is a sociopath who has convinced his three friends, Gerald Payne, an estate agent, Lawrence Davenport, a television, actor, and Toby Mortimer, a drug addict, whom he has known since their days at Cambridge, to lie on his behalf.  The wealthy and privileged Craig has contempt for the uneducated Cartwright and is elated when the jury finds Danny guilty.  The sentence:  twenty-two years in Belmarsh high-security prison.<br /><br />\\"A Prisoner of Birth\\" is reminiscent of Dumas' classic \\"The Count of Monte Cristo,\\" with Danny playing the role of Edmond Dantes, who was also the victim of a gross miscarriage of justice.  While in prison, Danny undergoes a major transformation.  His cellmate, Nick Moncrieff, is an sophisticated and cultured individual; under his tutelage, Danny loses his accent and begins to speak and behave like a gentleman.  He also takes courses and proves to be an intelligent and gifted pupil, especially in mathematics and business.  Although his future seems bleak, a series of unforeseen events provide Danny with the opportunity to clear his name while taking revenge on the people who wronged him.<br /><br />Archer has written an engrossing tale that is blessedly free of the sensationalism, gore, and explicit language that is common in today's fiction.  Archer's style brings to mind the novels of yesteryear, with a beginning, middle, and end, and no distracting flashbacks.  On the downside, Archer offers no shading in his characterizations; the villains are contemptible and the heroes are loyal and steadfast.  Since most people are somewhat familiar with the Dumas story, there are few surprises in store.  Still, once the reader becomes invested in Danny's fate, he will be interested to see how the young man's problems are eventually resolved.  There is something here for everyone: scenes of intense courtroom drama, a touching romance, high-stakes financial intrigue, and a few delectable twists and turns in the final chapters.  Although \\"A Prisoner of Birth\\" is not subtle, edgy, realistic, or brilliantly written, it is a good old-fashioned yarn, and that alone will earn it an eager audience.ty to clear his name while taking revenge on the people who wronged him.

B000LXH0AE|2.0|I was expecting great things from this. \\"Stranger Than Fiction\\" has been lauded by the critics, but unfortunately it never lives up to its reputation. While Will Ferrell's performance is strong, the script suffers from a lack of true invention; its intriguing central premise is never fully exploited, instead becoming bogged down in the same old tired romantic comedy conventions (boy meets girl. Girl hates boy. Boy wins girl over by playing the guitar and singing badly). Ferrell's and Gyllenhaal's characters are so patently incompatible that their relationship never rings true. Dustin Hoffman plays another cookie cutter eccentric who's not nearly as interesting as the screenwriter thinks he is (see \\"I Heart Huckabees\\" for another example of this) and Emma Thompson's character is simply annoying, a stereotype of an \\"important\\" novelist who just comes across as maudlin and self-absorbed. Indeed, it is her character's voice over narration which robs this film of its credibility: she is supposed to be a novelist of major talent and importance, a writer whose work is the subject of academic study and fevered reverence; yet the language she uses in her narration is so full of trite cliches and amateurish idiom (she uses expressions like \\"But little did he know\\" and \\"he found himself standing outside the building\\")that anyone with even a passing interest in or knowledge of \\"proper\\" literature will find it laughable. The audience is asked to believe that she is Jane Austen when in fact she writes like a housewife who's attended one evening class in creative writing; a hugely irritating flaw which, for this viewer, almost rendered the film unwatchable. There are one or two striking visual moments (watch out for the bulldozer) and Ferrell's character is given a couple of funny lines, but on the whole this film is a major disappointment. It is as though, in attempting to give it a broader appeal, screenwriter Zac Helm has smoothed away all its rough edges. With a 15 certificateand a good deal more imagination, it could have been truly innovative; instead it must go down as a wasted opportunity.
B000VWE5OY|4.0|Great series, but beware: If you watch all the features on the DVD disks in order, you'll be spoiled for episodes you haven't seen yet. And you should avoid the commentaries until you've finished the set as well. (Time saver: The post-episode behind-the-scenesers are, I think, entirely recycled in the longer \\"Torchwood Declassified\\" segments on the last disk, so you can skip these.)
B000K15VSA|5.0|If you're a Blade Runner fan, any review of this product will simply be superfluous. For everyone else, I hope the following is a useful review of this particular box set.<br />Suffice it to say, the package pretty much satiates any need you may have in connection with this haunting, gorgeous film. Be warned, though: even the most ardent lover of Blade Runner is likely to walk away sick and tired of the damned thing if it is watched in one session.<br />It is breathtaking in its scope: The 1982 Domestic Cut, the 1982 International Cut, the 1991 \\"Director's Cut\\" (falsely advertised as such, but closer to our man Ridley's intentions), the 2007 Final Cut - a true director's cut - and the Workprint, previewed in Dallas and Denver three months prior to the film's general release.<br />The 'making of' documentary runs to a staggering 3 1/2 hours, and talks to every surviving person you would want to hear from. Everyone. And that's not the only documentary. There are profiles of the late Phillip K Dick, the late, lamented cinematographer Jordan Cronenweth, and features on costumes, graphic design and the making of the Final Cut. And there are trailers, audio interviews with Dick, and other assorted segments.<br />There is also a 45-minute sequence of deleted scenes and alternate takes, tastefully edited into a linear narrative, featuring unused voice-over material from Harrison Ford. It doesn't quite work as an alternate version of the film (if you saw it without knowledge of the real film, you'd likely be lost), but it is a fascinating document.<br />The briefcase is plastic, and contains a plastic faux-origami unicorn and a miniature spinner, plus other little bits and bobs. This briefcase release is the only one to feature the workprint and the documentary on the Final Cut.<br />So: curious about Blade Runner? Check out the Final Cut [[ASIN:B000UD0ESA Blade Runner - The Final Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition)]], which includes the 3-hour doco. A confirmed fan?

0452289963|3.0|Just wasn't as inspirational as I thought it would be given all of Oprah's hype.  Maybe I've read too many other really deep thinkers to be impressed by this.
B000WMFZMY|4.0|Gorgeous epic about a hero too conflicted to hand over invading marauders he's captured who then promptly kills his girlfriend's father over a perceived slight. (Okayyyy.) That sets up a feud with his betrothed, which informed by Sophia's erotic petulence, is the best part of this picture.  (The second half isn't as good.)  Chuck's impressive, but still in his heroic phase lacking the ironic, arrogant self-loathing on display in Major Dundee and elsewhere.  Anthony Mann takes his time framing each shot. Great extras.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|Ciarin Hinds has to among the top of the list (if there is one) of the greatest actors in the World.  The entire cast in this movie consists of great actors.  This film is so believable to the point that I forget that I am acutally viewing a movie when I watch it.  The expressions, responses, gestures portrayed by these characters are so realistic. Nothing in this film is over dramatized like that in typical American movies. I guess I would have to give much credit to the producers, editors and others involved in the making of this film.      I have to admit that when I first watched this film, I was completely  bored.  I guess I was so condition to expect extraordinary amounts of action packed drama.  My problem still remains with most romantic films.  At the point that the characters are able to connect and share each others love, that is when the story ends.  Very, Very disappointing.  I would have given this film 4 stars for the very reason that the romantic part is far outweighed by the facets of suspense and contention leading up to the much-too-brief romantic end, but with this story, something else would have been left out.  My recommendation to this problem is for the filmakers to produce sequels to these films such as Pursuasion 2 or a more romantic title - where people can see the happily-ever-after portion of the story.  It would be great for the film makers, actors. etc and the movie viewers alike.  More money for the film makers, actors etc. and more quality entertainment for the movie viewers.
B000WTNCYA|4.0|The 23 year old  Philadelphian turned to music while recovering from a horrific accident and her recovery process led to a new career.  Before the accident she'd already been working part-time as a lounge pianist to help fund her studies, playing tunes by Duke Ellington or Billy Joel against a hubbub of hecklers and clinking glasses, and one of her doctors said she should try music-making as part of her recovery process.   The recordings she made in a wheelchair at her hospital bedside were eventually released in 2005 as \\"Some Lessons - The Bedroom Sessions\\".  Picked up by the same DJ who discovered Norah Jones, Melody started gaining acclaim and signed to Universal/Verve.  Well, if you liked Norah Jones and Madeleine Peyroux's beguiling mix of jazz, blues, country and folk, then check out this young singer-songwriter-guitarist, whose voice is purer than Peyroux's but just as characterful and charming.  \\"Worrisome Heart\\" will appeal to anybody fond of Norah Jones or Madeleine Peyroux, though its understated bluesiness also seems to reach further back to the heyday of vintage American songwriting.  She displays a rare knack for imbuing music that can sound false or clichéd in lesser hands with a shivery sense of intimacy, as though she sneaked up behind you to blow in your ear. She looks the part, too, smiling quizzically from behind a Veronica Lake peek-a-boo hairstyle. Add a penchant for crimson shoes and lipstick and fishnet tights, and you have the kind of dame who'd know how to keep Humphrey Bogart in his place.  It is extremely sexy and intimate - listen no further than the title track or the groovy \\"Goodnite'\\" - and on swinging numbers, such as \\"All I Need Is Love\\", it has the bounce and ebullience of a young Billie Holiday.   It's also true that tracks like \\"Sweet Memory\\" and \\"Goodnite\\" have similarities to Norah Jones' standards but unsurprisingly this survivor also has an edge.   A rising star of the modern jazz scene, this album has 10 songs which evoke nights in dark, intimate clubs before smoking was banned.  This album deserves to have the same cultish success as Peyroux's Careless Love and Jones' \\"Come Away With me\\".   It's quality stuff and ideal for turning the lights down low to and allowing you to sink into the mellow, seductive sounds of Melody.

B000683VI4|2.0|This movie seems to have taken its inspiration from The Stepford Wives, except that all the men are perfect. The women are not bad, either, which makes for a pretty boring story. There are no real conflicts, no really hard choices. Noah and Allie supposedly argue a lot, but you never hear what they're fighting about. Some of it's just kind of stupid - for example, you would think that Allie would check the mailbox at least once in a year. Some of it's just a bit absurd - for example, why does Allie answer the door wrapped in a blanket? Noah starts off charmingly crazy - dangling by one hand from a Ferris Wheel - and quickly becomes dotingly earnest. Well, there's something to be said for men who are passionately devoted to their wives. But I'll let someone else say it.

B000JLTRKE|5.0|I'm not an Oliver Stone fan, but I have to give him credit for this film. The terrorist attack on 9/11 is the background, but this story transcends that and becomes a universal story of large-scale tragedy and individual courage and survival. There is nothing gratuitous or overdone in this film, and it somehow manages to be both sensitive and direct.<br /><br />However, there is one point I am confused about, and perhaps another reviewer can clear it up. When the first tower collapses and the port authority police team are trapped under the rubble, there is a roll call. It seems to me that four or five men call out their names, but shortly after we only see three men, with no clue as to what happened to the others, and the story continues from there.

B000SINT52|1.0|Moore uses the hammer of partisan demagoguery to pound another nail into the coffin of the once-venerable documentary. There's so much to criticize our government about, yet Moore feels it is necessary to mislead and distort the facts. I wouldn't hold this movie up as a shining example of First Amendment rights; using Moore's standards of free speech, all of the evil politicians and corporations are exercising their freedom of speech to mislead and distort, and anyone can be made to look incompetent or evil, even Moore. Moore has some good points to make, but he fights fire with fire. A documentary should be made about documentaries!

B0000041BX|5.0|The Quartteto Italiano is easily my favorite string quartet. I have owned and enjoyed their complete Mozart and Beethoven sets of string quartets for many years. I was particularly pleased to find this two-disc set in the Philips Duo series of mid-price cds that includes Franz Schubert's last four quartets, because it has confirmed what I suspected even before I heard the recordings: the Italians are premier interpreters of that master composer's work as well! For me, the dramatic intensity they display in the \\"Death & the Maiden\\" is unsurpased; this is my favorite performance of the No. 14 quartet in D-minor. They are exceptional in the quartets Nos. 12,13 & 15 as well. The Philips sound is fine throughout, and at such an attractive price, this set is a real bargain. A must have for those who admire the Italian Quartet, as well as those who love the music of Schubert. Highly recommended!
B00133KFGW|5.0|In the end, Faith is a yearning for Home that's stronger than Death itself. Many of the great spiritual sages have said this in some form, including Robert Frost, Frederick Buechner, Rob Bell and Jesus himself.<br /><br />Of course, this all depends on how we conceive the idea of \\"Home\\" -- and \\"August Rush\\" takes the evolving \\"music video\\" genre into a transcendent, higher plane to explore one boy's profound yearning for a \\"Home\\" he never even knew, first hand. If you want something to be thankful for this year, buy this gloriously inventive movie that uses music as a metaphor for this abandoned boy's transcendent desire to reunite his shattered family.<br /><br />Freddie Highmore plays August Rush, whose fantastical musical gifts turn the whole story into a fable about the deepest human desires for Home. The movie borrows liberally from \\"Oliver Twist,\\" with Robin Williams playing a desperate and, eventually, an absolutely despicable Fagin-like character. Williams is a street-savvy con man who teaches abandoned children to become street musicians in the hope of someday striking it rich by managing a true musical star.<br /><br />At first, this Fagin discovers and befriends August -- but, when the boy's musical talents blossom, he winds up nearly destroying the boy.<br /><br />While that may make the movie sound like a rewarming of leftover storylines, the homage to Charles Dickens only adds to the fairy-tale quality of the film. In fact, it's the magical fusion of musical styles throughout the movie -- from rock and folk to classical to jazzy new renditions of natural and urban soundscapes -- that make this a theatrical experience you won't want to miss.<br /><br />Note to Rob Bell fans! If you love Rob's Nooma film, \\"Rhythm\\" -- well, \\"August Rush\\" is like a feature-length meditation on Rob's \\"Rhythm\\" theme. It's not as theological as Rob's reflection -- but it's the same message loud and clear with similar creative elements in the storytelling.<br /><br />\\"August Rush\\" opens with the abandoned boy who will become famous as a musical prodigy standing all alone in a lush green field of chest-high grasses, conducting the breezes that paint swirls in the moving sea of green and raise whooshing sounds into a symphony of natural noise.<br /><br />He narrates the opening sequence, inviting us to: \\"Listen! Can you hear it? The music? I can hear it everywhere,\\" he says. \\"In the wind. In the air. In the light.\\"<br /><br />By the end of this film, you'll be hearing it, too, and soaring with little August as high as you'll let this glorious music carry you.e famous as a musical prodigy standing all alone in a lush green field of chest-high grasses, conducting the breezes that paint swirls in the moving sea of green and raise whooshing sounds into a symphony of natural noise.

B000067J1H|5.0|I'm amazed at how few reviewers understand the message of this movie is:Modernity is inherently alienating and dehumanizing, ANY kind of re humanization is better than none or rather that it's inevitable that humans will eventually be thrust back together in more tribal-type relations and that although the form that this will take will often be ugly the process is both necessary and better than the alternative (the cube,the suburbs etc). The fight club doesn't represent the corruption of the characters, it is their salvation! The fact that they have to be saved in such an ugly way just high lites how pathetic their normal lives are. The fight club represents a true society  albeit one that is very brutal and unsustainable (versus one like out own that is temporal,artificial ultimately irrelevant[since it really can't inform the future]).  Maybe it's just because I have reading so much about Bedouins for the last 2 years but it just was very recognizable to me.  The fact is that wherever or whenever you go, a real economy of human relations will have certain basic traits:it will be relatively small (50-200 people),it will have a hierarchy based on ability and needs, it will be efficient and it will be intimate. A beautiful,timely film.    Matt
0307388840|1.0|I had very high hopes for this book when I purchased it, thinking that it was going to be a thrilling, heartbreaking romance-mystery and that I would be brought to tears by the end.  However, I was thoroughly disappointed after finishing it, and if I had been brought to tears, it would only have been for wasting my money.  For one thing, McEwan's characters never quite ring true.  Especially in the beginning, the characters' actions are difficult to see as realistic, and McEwan seems to be making them act in ways that are most convenient to move the story along, rather than having them act in a way that is understandable.  Cecilia's actions are difficult to believe, (does any woman, in any time period, *really* believe that taking their clothes off in front of a man is a good way to punish him for something?) The relationship between Cecilia and Robbie seems to have been far too rushed and incomplete to have lasted for so many years with censored letters as the only way to interact, as well.  Call me unromantic, but I found it hard to believe that two people could be so completely and purely devoted to one another when their romance began as, basically, a spur-of-the-moment hookup.      McEwan also seems to have difficulty deciding what sort of story he wants to tell.  At first, it appears to be a mystery: you know that a terrible crime will be committed, and perhaps McEwan hopes that readers will be kept guessing as to \\"who done it.\\"  However, it seemed so obvious to me from the beginning that I did not think the book could have been intended as a mystery.  Then I thought that perhaps the book was supposed to be a collective memoir, the kind that switches points of view in order to tell the whole story.  But this point of view switching is done too unevenly.  Briony gets most of the book devoted to her and her actions, Robbie gets a brief part in the beginning and the middle section all to himself, Cecilia only gets an inconsequential part of the beginning, and even Emily Tallis, Briony and Cecilia's mother, gets a chance to have the story told through her eyes, even though she is of little to no importance to the rest of the story, and her insights serve no purpose.  McEwan's switching from one point of view to the next is done very clumsily, and hinders the storytelling by giving the reader too much information rather than enhancing it.  He seems to want to show off all the research he must have done to write the novel, and consequently makes the whole thing extremely tedious and full of useless details.  Of course, the book could also be called a romance, but since it is told mostly from Briony's point of view and the feelings of Cecilia, one-half of the romantic duo, are largely ignored, the \\"romance\\" label isn't quite there, either.      In the end, McEwan suddenly jumps to the present day, and explains most everything that's happened to Briony since we left off in World War II. The ending seemed tacked on and unnecessarily drawn out. McEwan could have easily ended the book before his modern-day jump, even though we do not get to know what eventually happened to Robbie and Cecilia.  It is enough to know that Briony stole years from their lives and happiness, and his rushed explanation of what became of them in the end only makes Briony seem all the more self-centered, rather than making the book any better.  I, at that point, had long since stopped caring about Briony whom, even through her intense remorse at the crime she committed against her sister and Robbie, still keeps the spotlight focused on herself and her feelings rather than the plight of those she wronged.      I finished the book only so that I could criticize it from beginning to end--it is by far the worst disappointment I've ever had in a book.  I did not see the movie because of it, and I believe the only way that it could be any good at all is if Hollywood has done what it usually does with novels (that is, completely rewrite them.) I just know I'm notgoing to spend any more money on anything related to 'Atonement.'

B000ZOXDFA|3.0|I wonder: why do filmmakers bother to tackle an historical subject, if they are intent on changing so much of the facts that the result bears only a vague resemblance to what actually happened? What's the point? Why not simply revert to fantasy altogether? In this film about Queen Elizabeth I's \\"golden age\\", the time around the Armada attack of 1588, maybe the most surprising thing is the choice of protagonists. One gets the impression Francis Walsingham and Walter Raleigh were the two dominant forces in the Queen's life, which in fact they weren't by a long shot. Her most influential advisor and mentor, William Cecil, doesn't even appear on the cast list, and nor do the Earls of Leicester and Essex, who both ranked much higher on her list of favourites than Raleigh ever did. The latter character is turned into a swashbuckling hero, while in real life he was a vain and arrogant coxcomb, who wouldn't have dreamed to show himself in the slightly shabby, unvaried costume Clive Owen has to make do with - on the contrary, he loved expensive clothes and jewelry. He was also deeply unpopular at court.<br /><br />The Raleigh in this film is actually a conflation of Walter Raleigh and Francis Drake. It was the latter who brought the potatoe to England and who spent a great deal of time at sea. It was Drake, too, who vanquished the Armada, and though that is in the film, the notion of Raleigh being aboard and Drake seeking his advice is patently absurd. As is the idea of Elizabeth watching the burning ships from Tilbury, for the fleet engaged in battle in front of the French coast, not the English. Nor would she have seen so much flame: the fire ships scared off and dispersed the Spanish, but only one of their ships was actually burnt. And as for Tilbury: why do we get such a botched version of Elizabeth's celebrated speech? Even its most famous line (\\"I know I have the body of a weak and feeble woman...\\") is not in the film.<br /><br />Fortunately, the dealings with Mary, Queen of Scots are depicted somewhat more accurately, that is, if we forget that Mary would have had a French, not a Scottish accent and that Fotheringay wasn't set in majestic highland scenery but in the Northamptonshire flatlands. We get a good sense of the devious, scheming man Walsingham was - the J. Edgar Hoover of his day. Of course, Mary's exact role in the plot has never been established beyond doubt the way it seems here, but the interpretation is defensible. However, Walsingham's brother William, supposedly embroiled in the catholic plot, is entirely fictional: Francis was an only son. It's a far-fetched invention to add some psychological drama to Walsingham's character, something that might have been better achieved through a decent script. The scene where Elizabeth is held at gunpoint by Babington is another flight of fancy that relegates this film to the realm of Narnia and Lord of the Rings rather than that of historical drama.<br /><br />The main redeeming feature is Cate Blanchett's portrayal of the Queen herself. In its perfect combination of humanity, pride, temperament and regal dignity it seems closer to the real Elizabeth than others have ever come; one is made to understand why the English people worshipped her like a half-goddess (and made to forget that at the time of the Armada the Queen was actually a woman of 55; her teeth would most likely have been black. The makers themselves seem confused about her age, having her considering suitors and talking about her fertility). Blanchett's performance is helped in no small way by the terrific costumes, which exuberantly reflect Elizabeth's extravagant taste in dress. In general the film looks gorgeous. It is strange though, and rather absurd, that while the era of this Queen produced a great number of magnificent palaces in a style even named after her, the filmmakers insist on having her live inside Wells cathedral (we get a single, nighttime glimpse of a great Elizabethan house, Burghley, whichis apparently where Dr. Dee lives!). The gothic entourage, decorative as it may be, is entirely out of style.<br /><br />This film is quite different from the earlier one about Elizabeth's rise to the throne, both in style and accuracy. In both regards, the earlier instalment has the edge. This one can be watched for the eyecandy and Cate Blanchett, and as such is enjoyable enough, but as historical drama it is way off.Dee lives!).

B0010YSD7M|5.0|I was able to see this in a pre release version and was very pleased with the movie overall and though I have not received my copy from amazon yet can only assume that the \\"finished\\" product that will appear on the dvd will be equal to or most likely better in production value then what I saw! If your a fan of the series this is a must buy for a few reasons! 1. its a good movie and although they cram a big story into it to give closure to the ori story arc, which could have (and should have) been another season or 3 movies!!!!! it does give you closure.... 2. The producers and mgm have slated a second movie to follow this one dealing with a different storyline and have alluded to more possible movies in the future so the better the sales of this dvd the more chance we have on new and expanding stories in the sg1 universe!
B0000028VT|4.0|The song \\"With Out You\\" was alone worth Buying the Cd. Some of the songs are luke warm but, all in all, it's not a bad Cd.
B0011NVC9I|2.0|I remember the reviews were very mixed when it was in the theatres, but I was still looking forward to watching this on DVD.  However, I found it to be disappointing.  I thought it was a mistake doing the entire film in motion capture animation.  It was also unnecessary - even though a number of the action scenes couldn't have been done completely in live action, greenscreen technology could have been used for those while using the real actors the rest of the time (see any of the Lord of the Rings films).    And how many times can the guy scream his own name (probably about as many times as they used the Austin Powers \\"hide the salami\\" bit)?    I thought the fight with the dragon was outstanding (hence the second star), but the movie could have been so much better.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|SG-1 is searching for an artifact that can supposedly defeat the Ori once and for all, when they are unexpectedly attacked by a group of Ori followers. Teaming up with an unexpected ally, SG-1 heads out on the Odyssey to track down the Ark of Truth. But when the Odyssey is sabotaged, SG-1 finds themselves under attack from two dangerous enemy forces.<br /><br />Picking up where the end of season ten left off, Daniel (Michael Shanks), Sam (Amanda Tapping), Teal'c (Christopher Judge), Cam (Ben Browder), and Vala (Claudia Black) are all back and better than ever.  The main cast is just as fantastic as ever. And there are surprising guest stars that do a wonderful job of bringing in emotional connections.  The CGI and special effects of the action scenes and alien technology were as good as a big budget film. But then, Stargate has always excelled at producing high quality visual effects on a limited budget.<br /><br />SG-1 ended on a high note, with a cast that had amazing chemistry. And as one who owns all ten seasons of SG-1, I have to say that the last season was my favorite.  With the same wonderful humor, action, and special effects, the Ark of Truth makes for a super-charged, thrilling continuation of the one of the greatest and longest running science fiction shows in American history.  From laughing aloud to edge-of-your-seat excitement, this is one movie no Stargate fan should miss.
B0012K1ILW|3.0|Let me start off by saying I am a HUGE Erykah's fan. In a world of blandness and crappy songs, Erykah is one of those artists that will use music to challenge you. She is inspiring, different, creative, daring, unpredictable and a saver of soul music. On this record, I don't know what Erykah is trying to do. I usually love kilter and uncommercial music by Erykah...but I am really at lost with this project.    The album starts off with \\"Amerykhan promise\\". Despite its weirdness, this is one of the few tracks I dig. The song sounds like it came from a soundtrack to a 70s blaxploitation movie. Erykah is trading lines with a male narrator and the bassline and horns are blaring. This song will surely cause some religion folks to sit up because Erykah is basically saying hip hop is \\"bigger than religion or the government\\".     The song \\"Me\\" is autobiographical and deeply personal. Erykah gives us a look into her world as she confronts some of the decisions she has made in her life. This song basically tells us to accept her for who she is and nothing else because she is comfortable in her skin. The music can be described as a smooth jazz set to 70s soul.    Erykah's \\"Honey\\" is retro-contemporary funk song that sounds out of place on this strange project. It's probably the only song that is radio-friendly, which explains why it is a hidden track and is the first single.     \\"The cell\\" (jazz), \\"Master teacher\\" (psychedelic) \\"That hump\\" (crazy bassline), and \\"Soldier\\" (great message) deserves special recognition from me. However, it took MULTIPLE listenings for me to understand these songs.     As for \\"My people\\" and the other songs, I probably will never like (and trust me, I have tried). However, I don't consider this cd a lost cause. Erykah plays by her own rules and this is why I respect her so much. So I will say this to Ms. Badu, even though I am struggling with this project please keep challenging and provoking us with your music.
B000Y1ZXUM|3.0|I thought buying this on Blu Ray format would make a difference.  I guess I'm trying to compare it to Celine Dion's A New Day Blu Ray version.  But regardless, it's just okay for me.  The concert is not that awesome.  It's a typical concert.  The show lacks \\"umph\\" in to it.  Plus, the majority of the songs are in spanish and I don't understand it.  There are a few english songs which are her hits.  Other than that, you can skip the rest if you only prefer to hear the english songs.  If I have to do it again, I would've just rented it from Netflix.
B00000ING2|3.0|The Hudsucker Proxy is somewhat formulaic in the way it delivers it's story, with nothing really surprising in much of the plot or stylized windy dialogue.  It's not bad, but it's not great either.  Thankfully it throws in one or two curve-balls, but there are more forced laughs than clever moments. I'd give it three stars for the three stars: Newman, Robbins and Leigh.  It does take a few unconventional turns in reaching it's predictable ending, but outside the hula-hoop, there's not much of a twist in this story.
0345347951|5.0|Great book, loved the characters and the approach to the story was original. One of Arthur's best; recommend for utopian novel fans.
0743486285|4.0|This is a very cool product. I expected a straight-ahead diary, but found a graphic scrapbook of sorts; very engaging. He starts out quoting one of my favorite rockers, Alice Cooper, which roped me right in. Like most diaries, it left me wanting to know more, but it's a very honest, often funny look at one year in the out-of-control life of an addict--who happened to be a rock star.
0751529818|1.0|I don't know what all the fuss is about. I didn't think this book was that good. I have read a lot (!!) of memoirs and this one I could only rate at a 1-and that is stretching it. I didn't really get any new (or old) life lessons from Morrie..sorry. I was glad the book wasn't very long because I couldn't have read much more.  :(
B00005JPS6|4.0|I had NO DESIRE to see this movie.  I had promised my 10 yr old that I would take him so, off we went.  I was pleasantly suprised.  I thought it was a precious movie with a great message!
B000R5N1MC|5.0|Needless to say, I'm a Blade Runner fan.  I've owned practically every version that was released, including the first VHS, two different laser disc versions including the Criterion \\"International\\" cut, and the original DVD \\"Director's\\" cut.  But, the HD DVD release, including the Ridley Scott \\"Final Cut\\", is genuinely the ULTIMATE.  The new Final Cut has footage never before seen, omits the hackneyed narration, and in HD with Dolby True HD sound, is like viewing the film anew.  The HD image is so sharp one can discern every individual light in the Tyrell complex' huge building, and every wrinkle in J. F. Sebastion's face.  The sound, with that beautiful Vangelis music, is simply overwhelming.  Buy it!  And, even if you don't yet have an HD player, I recommend you buy that version.  Having ALL the various versions together on such a great media is worth every penny of the purchase price.  And, the price: best I've seen at on-line and brick-and-mortar merchants!  Oh, and the brief case with the other goodies?  Just frosting on a rich cake!<br /><br />Finally, I can't end without a hardy 'Well Done!\\" concerning Amazon's excellent service, and their exemplary attention to customers' needs.  They are second to none in the mail-order world.  It is a genuine pleasure dealing with them.
B0013D6LEM|5.0|I'm not the biggest fan of dance or R & B music, but this album cuts across several genres and has long established itself for the pop landmark that it is. Being a longtime listener of top 40 music, I have to say that Michael Jackson's \\"Billie Jean\\" is one of the most well written and well crafted pop song ever. It was a multi-million dollar best seller and soared to the top of the pop charts in 1983. The video was great too being a landmark clip that broke the color barrier for exposure on MTV. No one can escape the infectious beat of \\"Billie Jean\\", and frankly most of the other songs on the album too.<br /><br />Stand outs include \\"Beat It\\" with its heavy rock backbeat and \\"Wanna Be Startin' Something\\", a real get off your seat kind of dance track. And then the tender \\"The Girl is Mine\\" duet with Paul McCartney picks up where Jackson left off on his previous album and a solo McCartney tune he did on his own called \\"Girlfriend\\".<br /><br />Pure pop genius for its time, \\"Thriller\\" has withstood the test of time to make it one of the greats in pop music right along landmark albums by The Beatles, Fleetwood Mac and the Rolling Stones.
0385474547|1.0|I wanted to spoon my eyes out every time I turned a page. \\"No more!\\" I cried. \\"No more!\\" It made the things in my brain fall apart...but then I was on acid. I saw yams for twelve straight hours. I thought I was a yam. I stripped down naked and called myself Ikemefuna, I thought my roommate was Okonkwo coming to kill me. I banished myself to the linen closet which I thought was the evil forest. Except I couldn't fit my three wives in there with me, so I beat them and sent them to the neighbors house their motherland.
B0011KQSZ4|3.0|Well I am going to admit that there are some hillarious spots where the sheer oddity of the movie makes it funny. Obviously there are a number of strange events that take place in order to bring about the resulting situations. The movie starts out very dry and somewhat confusing. The dryness then continues throughout the film with some more crazy antics coming to light. Maybe it would be a good film to rent or add to your Netflix list but wouldn't recomend buying it unless you like dry humor.
B000P12LWY|2.0|I am no historian, merely a casual fan of the time period in which this show takes place, and in the story of Henry VIII and how he changed England and history itself because of one woman.  When I read the reviews here, I scoffed, telling myself that people were too married to historical accuracy to really appreciate a good show and that no errors would take away from my personal enjoyment of it.<br /><br />However, even my casual knowledge of the actual events behind this show made it impossible for me to watch with any real appreciation.  The historical errors are so glaring, so shameless, that I eventually got bored watching all together.  I can't see this appealing to anyone with even scanty knowledge of the time period; it will drive you nuts.  But if you don't know anything about it, don't care anything about it, or love Jonathan Rhys Myers enough to forgive everything and keep watching (I thought I did, but alas, I'm afraid I don't.) then more power to you.  I probably won't finish watching all the discs, and I don't consider that a loss.  So I can't review the special features, because neither of the discs I saw had any.<br /><br />I should also add that neither of the discs had any closed caption either.  This is a shameful thing, because people who are hard of hearing will not be able to get any enjoyment at all from this program.  As it is, with all the different accents in play, it's sometimes hard to understand what is being said and without captions, I am at a total loss.  This is another reason I lost interest so quickly.  I couldn't follow all the details of the story -- however inaccurate that story turned out to be.
B000WTNCQS|5.0|To answer that question.....NO...it was delivered in the time frame I was given,it was packaged and undamaged.....and the simple fact it was U2 made it TOO good a deal to pass up....Beautifully priced,2 CD's,1 LIVE DVD,bonus pictures of the Joshua Tree Photo Shoot and a Book of the Band with more Photos and Lyrics to the songs to go with it....all brand new and fits nicely into One Box so you dont misplace any of it.....thankyou,from a very Happy U2 FAN....
0618918248|5.0|Say what you want about his philosophy, but he certainly is a good writer. The audio-version is nice because the readers, Dawkins and his wife, both have a good voice. The written version is nice because it contains many quotes and references that you can look up.     Kind of silly, review # 1114. Very helpful, I guess.
B0010V4TZU|2.0|I have to say that this album is overhyped.  It's catchy, yes, and, for that reason, is good for a few spins.  But the album is short and the songs get tiresome after a very short while.  It's nothing to blow anyone's mind, but seems more of a Strokes rip-off band with a tinge of Paul Simon.  I'd say go buy Graceland by Paul Simon and you'd get more value out of your money.  Of course, there's nothing wrong with a more \\"classic\\" indie sound.  Just wish this album offered something at least a little new and original.
B00008DDSC|2.0|It is hard to catergorise this film. Whether it is a romantic comedy, a black comedy, a drama or a sexual thriller there really is only one word I can use to describe it...Boring.<br />I bought this without seeing it for one reason and one reason only. Maggie Gyllenhaal... She is an amazing actress and I am a big fan of her talents and while I was expecting this movie to be left of centre, not even her performance could stop me from falling asleep in parts.<br />Its not that I bought this without knowing anything about it, I researched it and read many reviews, the storyline did interest me but I was just always waiting for the movie to get into it. James Spader is stale, as was the rest of the supporting cast. Two stars however for Maggie Gyllenhaal, who's performance alone will no doubt attract fans of hers to this film.
B0010V4TZU|5.0|Highly recommended. It reminds me of a mix between poppy-punk and Paul Simon's \\"Graceland\\"; an African sound with a punk flavor. The combination is so fresh and fun, lots of energy. I now need to purchase another one because I lent my copy to a friend and she won't give it back!
1400031362|4.0|Another great read from the ladies detective series.  I'm ready for the next book.
B000VBJEFK|5.0|Some movies in HD (either HD-DVD or Blu-Ray) look and sound only marginally better than their standard definition counterparts.  RATATOUILLE, however, is one of those movies that can really be appreciated even more if you are fortunate to own a Blu-Ray player.    I have watched both the standard def and the Blu-Ray versions on my Blu-Ray player.  The Blu-Ray version looks better than the standard def version (although the standard def version looks quite good too.)    For me, HD (both formats) really excel in the audio mix.  Small, subtle details are more easy to discern in the HD version and that is certainly the case with this movie.  Center channel dialog is crisp and clean.  If you have a really good monitor and home theatre system, do yourself a favor and spend the few extra dollars for the Blu-Ray version.    Oh yes, I suppose you'll also need to buy a Blu-Ray player or PlayStation 3.    Disney really understands the value of turning out a superior product.
032147404X|5.0|I got a lot of good tips out of this book.  I liked his writing style which made it an easy read.  Skip the first several pages if you are not into lame jokes.  Not near as bad in volume 2, which I also recommend.
B0010ZR160|5.0|This is a great flick. So many twists and turns, probably more than I have ever seen. Very well done picture with suspense throughout. There isn't a moment when the film drags, it is turned up all the way until the last scene.
B000002KGT|5.0|Fleetwood Mac's \\"Rumours\\" stands on its own strength.  That strength is a continuation of strong tracks from start to finish.  There's not a weak song in the house.  Reminiscent of \\"Sgt. Pepper\\", Rumours captivates the listener from start to finish and is a pleasurable music experience.
0452289963|5.0|THIS BOOK HAS TAKEN THE COUNTRY BY STORM!  EXCELLANT FOR HELPING ONE CHANGE THE VALUES AND  CREATING STRENGTH IN THEIR LIVES
B000WTBMBK|1.0|This is one of the worst albums I've had the displeasure of hearing in some time. The entire albumn is like a tease or a extended prelude or intro to a song that never happens and goes nowhere. Every beat is almost exactly the same (with slight treatment variations) except for the song \\"rave\\" which is 4/4 beat - uninspired really. I do like some of the atmospheric sounds and noise, but its way subtle and does nothing to move any of the songs forward or beyond meandering. I've read all the reviews here and thought this was going to be somthing big, deep and dark but it felt like it hardly got outta' bed. It's dull and repetative. The stale sounding beats conflict with the low level atmospherics and the male/female voice stuff is pointless and laughable. Are there any actual lyrics? Nothing about this is dark or deep, more like the cover colors of the albumn, gray and dull.   I'm a huge fan of Portishead, DJ Shadow, DJ Spooky,Third Eye Foundation, Final, Aphex Twin, Massive Attack and Tricky. Does this compair to any or one of these mentioned? Not even close. One song by DJ Spooky contains more atmopherics than this whole albumn. The first track (all 5 sec. of it) was useless. The first time you hear the beat kick in, it's kinda interesting in it's sycopation, but the same or similar beat is used on almost every track. There is no bass or back bone to the track's and the meandering nature of music and voices (do the voices say anything beyond Ohh, Ahh, Hey and such?). Oh, did I mention that the Vocoder get's used too? Uhg, this effect was old when Cher used it, and Daft Punk over-uses it to annoyance. The voices are sparse and at times come across in an \\"Alvin and the Chipmunks\\" fashion that pulls you out of the \\"atmospherics\\" within the tracks. I get what this artist is going for, but much of this is so backround and forgettable that that I really am flumoxed over the praise that this is getting. Each track goes nowhere and leaves you with no impression. I'd rather listen to the actual evening sounds than this contrivance and ill representation of anything remotely trippy dub drool. I was fooled by the cover art as well, but maybe I should have paid attention better to the graphic of what looks like some fellah' in a hoodie falling alseep waiting for his coffee to cool down, because I certainly felt this way while listening to this. zzzzzzzz.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|I read a review about this movie last summer and made it a point to see it as soon as it was released on DVD.  First of all, this movie is very raw and the fact that the leads are not really actors, you feel as though you are watching something real.  The two leads are obviously well suited for each other both on and off screen, just look at the way is looks at her, it gave me chills!  Not to mention the music is awesome and Glen Hansard is such a fantastic musician, I immediately downloaded the soundtrack AND some of the music he did with The Frames.  Any award this movie won was well deserved!  Buy this DVD, because if you rent it, you will go buy it anyways to watch over and over!!!!
B000IMV4IW|3.0|Back in 1994 I was pretty much fed up with grunge, specially the way the music industry had exploited the alternative rock genre, but in late 1994 I saw the video for \\"Live Forever\\" by a new band from Manchester, England, Oasis and made an instant impact on me, I tought these guys are going to be huge, and they were. Their debut album \\"Definitely Maybe\\" was an instant classic and in less than a year they followed it up with their sophomore album \\"What's the Story (Morning Glory)\\" and they were on top. In reality the Brit-Pop Scene had been started a couple years before by Blur and Suede, but Oasis were the biggest band of them all. Now was Oasis destined to be the next great Rock N Roll band and release more great albums? We now know that wasn't the case, they became bloated. The albums they released after, weren't as nearly as good as their first two albums. In 2006, 12 years after and with their contract expired with Sony, it was time to release a retrospective of their hits. This was not Oasis first compilation, in 1998 they released \\"the Masterplan\\" a collection of B-sides up to that time. So Noel Gallagher took the task of assembling the greatest anthems this band ever produced, which to me is a no brainer, right? It looks like Noel had a very different idea, he selects 4 B-sides already included in \\"the Masterplan\\", ignores \\"Be Here Now\\" completely and almost \\"Standing on the Shoulder of Giants\\" by including only one song of it. They pressed 2 CDs but only put nine songs on each. I knew all this but the reason I bought this compilation was an improvement in sound, it was minimal. To be honest if you already have the albums, you don't need this, if you are just getting into the band there is no way around it, buy the first two albums, they  are classics, as for this compilation the one good thing about it is the price. I see now a box set in the future which should be more comprehensive, but for now this is my ideal song listing:    Disc A: 1.Rock N Roll Star,2.Live Forever, 3.Supersonic, 4.Cigarrettes and Alcohol, 5.Slide Away, 6.Roll With It, 7.Wonderwall, 8.Morning Glory, 9.Don't Look Back In Anger, 10.Champagne Supernova.    Disc B: 1.D'You Know What I Mean, 2.Stand By Me, 3.Don't Go Away, 4.Go Let It Out, 5.Who Feels Love, 6.The Hindu Times, 7.Stop crying Your heart Out, 8.Layla, 9.The Importance of Being Idle, 10. Stop the Clocks (I heard they recorded a new song, but for some reason didn't include it in this compilation).
B0010V4TZU|3.0|This is a decent little pop record, but that's all it is. Airy, sunny, afro-pop tinged melodies about nothing much at all.     Remember Haircut 100? Yeah, this is them, just a younger incarnation. Heck, they even LOOK like Haircut 100, sweaters and all.     The Strokes? Are you kidding me? This is nowhere close to the Strokes. Not even in the same universe. Some of the Paul Simon comparisons are apt, if you go back to Graceland or Rhythm of the Saints. But if you really want a parallel, all you have to do is dust off that old Haircut 100 record.      It's a shame, that people are going to be slagging this band a year from now. They neither deserve inordinate praise nor ridicule. This is simply an innocuous pop record to put on in the background while sunning in the backyard on a spring Sunday, gin and tonic close at hand.

B00004RF83|5.0|I READ THE BOOK WHEN IT WAS FIRST RELEASED.  THEN I READ THE READER'S DIGEST CONDENSED VERSION.  THEN I WAW THE MOVIE AT THE THEATRE WHEN IT WAS RELEASED.  SEVERAL YEARS LATER I SAW THE MOVIE ON TV, AND RE-READ THE BOOK.  MY NEPHEW WAS TALKING ABOUT A GOVERNMENT TAKE OVER CONSPIRACY WHEN I WAS AGAIN REMINDED OF THIS MOVIE.

0525950079|5.0|There are books that you read, with vaguely interesting stories, that sometimes within less than a month have been forgotten, ignored, barely recollected except for title, author and a minor recall of plot. Then there are books that change your mind on life, that give you a thrill as you read them and think about how much you're loving to read this particular book, and how it's making such an impression on you, and how you're going to remember it for a long part of your life. I don't need to tell you which kind of book World Without End is. I'm also not going to give you a formal, regurgitated plot summary that you can find in just about any review of this book. I am however going to try to convince you why you should read this book with the intention that it will have the same pivotal impression on you as it did on me.    While I have never been a fan or proponent of the seemingly omnipotent Oprah and her book club, she nevertheless has the power to make a considerable number of Americans do, and more importantly, read whatever she tells them. In January of this year, Oprah nominated Ken Follett's Pillars of the Earth for her book club and overnight people of all different kinds, and of unexpected types, picked up this lofty paperback tome set in the Middle Ages and documenting the fascinating building of a giant cathedral with immense architectural detail. It's one of my favorite books, and to see so many people buying it and reading it made me happy. Naturally, once these people got to the last page of Pillars of the Earth, and assuming they enjoyed it as much as Oprah said they would, they would then turn to World Without End. Follett's new book has been labeled as the sequel of Pillars of the Earth, which is not exactly correct, for none of the original characters are in the new book, and it is set in a later period, however it involves descendants of the main family in Pillars of the Earth, and there is the memory and impression left by characters both in historical record and physical form, such as the cathedral. But World Without End takes many giants leaps further forward as a deeper and more complex book than Pillars of the Earth ever did, equivalent to an ant making its way along a path, while a person looks down upon the ant as they walk by. Perspective is the key here, and if one has some knowledge of the fourteenth century, one will enjoy the book all the more.    Don't look for the good guys to always win out, and the bad guys to fail in World Without End because, like real life, this world does not reward those who do good and punish those who do bad; it's a harsh world that gives more opportunity to the survivors of the fittest. You must also remember that this is the fourteenth century, the time of the peasant and noble, a time where class distinction was at the most severe and was a defining character of every person. Though while there is all this suffering, one cannot help but think at some point it must get better for the characters you like, and worse for the characters you hate, and this is after all a novel, but don't expect Follett to do anything you might predict.    The fourteenth century had a lot going on throughout Europe, and what makes World Without End an incredible novel, is that Follett uses the monumental and catastrophic events in microcosm focused on couple of small towns in England. There was a cooling of temperatures, which led to crop failure and starvation for many peasants, known as the Great Famine; coupled with this was the uprising of peasants against their noble overlords, who had subjugated and oppressed them for so long, known as the Peasant's Revolt. There was the growing guild system, where anyone wanting to become skilled in a trade would have to be invited to become a member of a guild. Then there was horrific plague that was estimated to wipe out half the population of Europe, known as the Black Death. There was also the moving of the papacy from Rome to Avignon, France, which created a fission in the Christian faith and led to questioning and critique of the absolute religion. Finally there was the seemingly never ending Hundred Years War.    Follett skillfully uses these events in World Without End, weighing in at 1024 pages, but never overtly calls out any of them for what they are, partly because a lot of the terms and names for the events were not yet in existence, and because he seeks to be less overt and obvious, but to have these events occur in most cases beyond the scope of these small towns, to be events occurring far away that have little importance and effect on the citizens of the town - much like the Iraq War is for the American people today. At least this seems the case at first, and then the subliminal effects come into play, where men head off to war, craftsmen have to fight to get into guilds, peasants are suffering and in some cases starving, the church is overbearing in its control and being questioned, and finally with the arrival of the plague, the people's lives and the towns are changed forever.    World Without End takes you on a journey through the fourteenth century, but not via a history lesson, but in the important and complex lives of some ordinary townspeople of varying classes, their loves and losses, their hopes and dreams, their despair and suffering. It's a moving and some might say depressing book, but as I mentioned, the fourteenth century was a tumultuous time to say the least. But when you get to the last page, you'll wish it had never happened, you'll wish for more story, for more characters, you'll wish to remember this incredible story for a long time.    FOOTNOTE: Just as World Without End has 1024 pages, conveniently (and maybe with a little effort on my part) these review has 1024 words.    [...]  [...]
B000GGSMB2|5.0|Its funny how one of the most repulsive movies I have watched has quickly become a cult classic favorite in my eyes.  Though some people who love this movie see it for entertainment purposes (and the \\"Say hello to my little friend\\" scene is certainly one of the most entertaining in cinematic history) much more can certainly be said about the real purpose behind Scraface.  A simple message is implied by the end of the film, though its pretty obvious from nearly the beginning as well, and that is, now matter how much you \\"fly straight\\" in this dirty business, your fate is basically already written.  Its almost ironic.  Scarface is easily the cliche of a film you never want your children to see, yet at the same time, the message and the way that is portrayed is something they need to understand, though with the 200+ \\"f\\" words and the excessive violence and drug content, it probably is better to play it safe about allowing younger audiences to watch Scarface.  However, compared to films like the present day American Gangster with Denzel Washington, Scarface is beginning to feel milder all the time.<br /><br />Al Pacino is the star here, naturally, and its amazing how different his acting abilites for his Cuban character \\"Tony Montana\\" are compared to his famous role in The Godfather.  It takes a bit to get used to the accent, but his lines become those you love to quote, and eventually you want to both love and hate Tony Montana at the same time.  The supporting cast is just as impressive, but considering the film was released in 1983, you have to expect a couple of cheesy, overacting at some point.  Same goes for the music.  I actually love the score, though it is very 80's with songs like \\"She's on Fire\\" played in the club.<br /><br />The movie takes a patient watch, running a little under 3 hours in time.  Scenes either move along quickly or get dragged down, but when the action roles it stay real and perfecly in flow with the story.  Aside from the final shootout in the film, the gun fire scenes and other forms of violence are just enough to progress the plot, instead of providing mass entertainment (though with this kind of film, violence for entertainment purposes begins to tread over tricky waters).<br /><br />Scarface has become one of those films everyone needs to watch at least once.  Whether you will like it or hate in in the end, it has become so popular you just have to find out what all the hype is about.  It really is a great film, and chances are you may only dislike it for the obsessive dirty business protrayed.  It can be entertaining to some, but also realize the film makes a point and says something.  With that said, I believe its possible for anyone to enjoy this film.  Scarface doesn't have the best action, acting, etc. in a film, but it certainly goes down as one of greatest Gangster movies of all time with a teriffic story.<br /><br />The Platinum edition has been remastered, both video and audio.  The video wasn't overaly impressive, but the audio was fantastic, especially the gun explosions in the finale.<br /><br />Acting - 4<br />Action - 4<br />Characters - 5<br />Story - 5<br />Overall - 5gun fire scenes and other forms of violence are just enough to progress the plot, instead of providing mass entertainment (though with this kind of film, violence for entertainment purposes begins to tread over tricky waters).

B0013D8LOU|3.0|Despite having a good score, enjoyable songs, and excellent performances by both Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter, there was one problem I had with this film.<br /><br />The plot centers around Barker's (or Todd's, I suppose) pursuit for revenge against Turpin (Alan Rickman is great, by the way) I don't have a problem with this crusade. In fact, that would have been a great movie. The problem for me is that in order to \\"practice\\" he slits the throats of countless extras while waiting for Turpin to arrive.<br /><br />Why is it such a big deal that Turpin tore Barker's life apart, yet the audience isn't supposed to think twice about the wife and kids of the men whose throats Barker slits without a second thought? It's seems condradictory to me...<br /><br />What is the thing that people love so much about anti-hero films? Whatever it is, I seem to have missed it.<br /><br />But really, the acting is good.

B0000DZEA1|5.0|I am quite surprised by the number of reviews that don't give this five stars. Never has there been a score that can provide such depth and emotion in every second.

B000VBJEEG|5.0|When I saw the teaser for this on the Cars DVD, I was actually quite dissapointed. A cooking rat? Pixar was trading superheroes and stock cars for a rodent and cooking utensils?<br /><br />And then I went and saw it. The five stars it gets are more than well earned. While I can't put my finger on exactly what made it so good, I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed the time I spent in that theater.<br /><br />The voices were good, the music adds a very nice aspect to the film, and Anton Ego is one of the best characters Pixar has cooked (I'm not trying to be funny, I swear) up yet. The animation is ever improving and the dialogue was snappy and funny.<br /><br />It won best animated feature for 2007, but I might go so far as to say it's the best animated feature in film history.
B0014CQNTK|4.0|There was a lot of hype buzzing around this movie back in 2007 and then 2008 when \\"Award Month\\" came around in January and February. Nevertheless, I, like I usually do, wrote it off as just another \\"Indie\\" movie not worth the weight in merit or anything else, even if I was curious enough to admit that I wanted to see it myself. So somewhere at the end of December I scrounged up some money and went to see the movie in the theaters.     As I sat there and watched it, two things occurred to me; (1): The movie wasn't half-bad, it was actually entertaining and different outlook on teenage pregnancy. (2): I wanted to strangle whomever thought it was good idea to subject the audience to the terror that was aptly named \\"Indie-music\\" throughout the entire movie instead of investing into finding a composer to create a score --- hopefully not akin to Thomas Newman`s score for \\"Pay it Forward\\". And if there was one... I didn't hear it.    Anyhow, Juno follows the story of a sardonic [and easy-going] teenager, Juno MacGuff (\\"X-Men\\" - [The Last Stand`s], third shadowcat, Elle Paige), whom, after taking at least three pregnancy tests (aided by entire gallon of Sunny-Delight) -- must comes to grips with the fact that a night of first-time sex with \\"boyfriend\\" Paulie Bleeker, has lead to her inevitable pregnancy. She contemplates getting an abortion, but a moment of mortality hits her and she decides to keep the baby. After telling her father, Mac (J.K Simmons) and step-mother Brenda (Allison Janney), her friend Leah (Olivia Thirlby) suggests to put the baby up for adoption. Enter Mark and Vanessa Long (Jennifer Garner), a couple seeking a child to love and raise, as they apparently cannot conceive one of their own. This series of events had Juno contemplating her relationship with her \\"boyfriend\\" Paulie, creating a friendship between herself and the Longs, and dealing with the leering eyes of her fellow schoolmates... Among other things.    Simply put, I did enjoy this movie.Its probably one of the most refreshing movies in 2007 that I've seen, next to Waitress, which you just have to see (Keri Russell is just amazing). Both these movies are a 100 times better in quality and humor, compared to that grossly overrated debacle of a movie starring Katherine Heigl, which I will not utter here. Diablo Cody manages to create a storyline concerning teen pregnancy that doesn't become a cliché within itself; The characters don't make a big drama out of the fact Juno has gotten herself pregnant. Juno herself doesn't whine about this fact; She has no big plans that were suddenly ruined by this turn of events, nor does she even fret about her education or her status in school. Her parents don't even act like it's the end of the world, they just help her whenever the help is needed and give out advice when its needed.     The relationship's between the characters are believable and never feel rehearsed. I especially love, how Garner's character -- a obvious preppy, and a slightly uncomfortable with Juno at first -- develops throughout the movie. Jason Bateman's Mark Long, at first, is a pretty interesting guy, who at first seems like the husband under the suppressive directive of his wife [if you get my meanin']. But as the movie goes on, it turns out that's just the opposite and not even the vice-versa. The humor is sarcastic and sometime's witty. Performances are fresh, especially from Ellen Paige.     She was one of the main reasons I really didn't want to see this movie; I didn't enjoy her performance in X3, and I thought she was just plain overrated in Hard Candy. But thankfully, Ellen Paige manages to breathe life into a quirky character that would've otherwise been a product of watching too much Buffy The Vampire Slayer and Gilmore Girls (two perfect examples of sardonic characters, who drawl in the monotone and use sarcasm daily), and thus just a carbon copy full of lines worthy of Whedon-isms. Besides 13 Going on 30, I've never really watched a movie where I enjoyed Jennifer Garner's performance. Even if she's in this movie very little, most of the time, she is also another good reason to see this movie. The montage featuring her character (whose face you never see until she greets Juno and Mac MacGuff) sprucing up her house, herself, and placing parenting/baby magazine's on the coffee table to showcase her devotion in Juno's decision to help her achieve motherhood --should she agree-- give you insight into what kind of her person she is on the surface, but she's much more underneath. Her awkwardness around children in one scene reminded me of myself (I haven`t been a kid in so long (four years), its weird to be on the other side of the looking glass now).    Now for the movies downsides: Juno's replay value is very little. I thought watching this movie a second time would be like watching any other movie. However, as I sat through the first half-hour, I found myself getting bored and my attention was wandering elsewhere. So for me, its not a movie you watch again. Diablo's dialouge in mosts parts, were just plain silly (and obviously inspired by Joss Whedon's ability to create some quirky dialouge or catchphrases that only works on TV), and sometimes overbearing. As I said before earlier, the \\"Indie\\"/pop music was really lost on me. Its not my kind of music and honestly, its just terrible. It hurts my ears. Why on earth would I want to listen to a \\"singer\\" drawl on with lyrics that make absolutely not seen whatsoever, with instrumentals that stirs nothing within me? All in all, Juno turns out to be a very entertaining movie that doesn't make a big deal out of the subject matter its covering. Highly Recommended --- [4 out of 5] - [March 10TH, 2008]
B000NA28I4|1.0|I am a large fan of the book, and was looking forward to seeing this.<br /><br />IT WAS TERRIBLE!<br /><br />It was so Hollywoodized I could barely breath, complete with cheesy one liners that should have found themselves on the cutting room floor.<br /><br />I the middle of the movie, I couldn't stop myself from standing up and screaming: \\"LOOK OUT FRODO SKYWALKER! DARTH VOLDEMORT IS COMING TO KILL YOU WITH HIS LIGHT WAND!\\"<br /><br />It was shortened to a painful length, and the battle scene wasn't even good.<br /><br />I say a remake...Alfonso Cuaron for director.

0451169514|3.0|Stephen King's \\"It,\\" clocks in at 1,090 pages. Many people consider it his masterpiece, others believe it's too long...The former claim that you just need to have patience, but, honestly, how much patience can one have with a book like this? I saw the TV-movie \\"It\\" about 8 years ago and it's a pretty disturbing, well-made piece of work for a TV-movie. In fact, oddly enough, it may be better than this book (it's been a few years I saw the movie). But, anyway, a brief synopsis of the novel: 7 friends from Derry, Maine are now successful adults with no memory of their childhoods, but soon they're called back to Derry by Mike Hanlon to keep the promise they made years ago as children. As children, they were terrorized by It or Pennywise the Dancing Clown, a boogeyman of sorts who goes around killing children. The novel transitions back and forth from revealing what happened during the character's childhood and what's happening through adulthood. But, was it really necessary to use 1,090 pages to tell this story. The movie (which was about 3 or 4 hours, if I recall) really cut it down to the essential of the story...And, let me ask the people reading this a question. Who is the most interesting character in this story? It's Pennywise! And his character, in that form, is small (almost nonexistent) in this novel. And it's 1,090 pages! They are parts of this novel that are really good and few writers are as good as King at writing people, the kids seem very realistic...But this novel is way too long and the editor clearly wasn't doing his job very well. Also, there are a lot of typos in the Signet edition of this novel. And, no, I'm not one of those idiot's who mistakes a word in the cadence of the character as a typo. There's a few times in there, where there are actual misspelled words...And they're very noticeable. \\"It\\" has great moments, but ultimately fails as a whole. Many parts are tedious and the pacing is way off. Sad to say since I love Stephen King, but...There you go.    GRADE: C
014017821X|1.0|This is bad writing at its worst because it is apparent that it could have maybe been good.    The imagery is dull, cliché, and facile. The stories are predictable and, worst of all, uninteresting. Everything is over-stylized, obvious, and with very little sense of anything novel or surprising. In reality, they are unintelligent and prepubescent. In general, a waste of time.
B0000027EP|5.0|Since Lemmy has been hauling this outfit known as Motorhead along now for over thirty years, I will have to call this 1991 album one of the bands, \\"mid-year\\" albums. This album is not in the same realm of brilliance as the original line-up, still it is not like the later era 'Head albums, the 'Time to play the game' type stuff that I think have more of a dark and sinister tone to them than any other albums before them. This album falls right in between, and it shows a few sides to Lemmys act that are not on any other of the bands discs. For that reason, this album holds up as one of the bands best and most unique albums.<br />Theres a good amount of hard rockers in the true Head spirit, but also some few very well polished tunes that still sound really good. I've always thought of Lemmy as the type of guy that can mold his act to whomever he plays with, only still always remaining true to the token theme he looks for in music (nasty, loud etc.) Here he does wonders with his new band, and some early nineties recording values, and comes up with 1916. An essential album in any Motorhead collection as far as i'm concerned. Less on the sinister though. And of course you should get Ace Of Spades, Overkill, Bomber and the self titled first. Some may say '88's Orgasmatron after those, but this is my next favorite.  Although, they're all pretty good.

B0010X8NF0|4.0|Synopsis: An ornate and psychedelically colored train known as the Darjeeling Limited transports three estranged brothers; Francis (Owen Wilson), Peter (Adrien Brody) and Jack (Jason Schwartzman) to destinations unknown (actually Francis is attempting to arrange a rendezvous with their constantly disappearing Mother (Anjelica Huston) now living as a nun in Tibet). It has only been a year since their Father's tragic death and each brother carries their own personal heartache over his passing and their Mother's disturbing absence from the funeral.<br /><br />As one comes to expect when traveling with others, close proximity, annoying behaviors and old wounds eventually surface which must be dealt with as they arise. Add to the mix unforeseen events both aboard the train and at intermittent stopovers along the way and you have the makings of a transformational experience unlike anything the brothers could have anticipated.<br /><br />Critique: The '07 film `The Darjeeling Limited' begins painfully slow and incomprehensibly weird but if you have the fortitude to survive the first 40 minutes you will eventually find yourself on a delightfully oddball, unpredictable trek across the Indian subcontinent on a spiritual journey in search of physical, emotional and relational healing. Serving as a metaphor for life's journey, one might say that we are all aboard the Darjeeling Limited headed in the same direction to parts unknown. In the final analysis one learns that it's not where you're headed but how much baggage you drag along with you.<br /><br />There's a lot of food for thought hidden away in this film for those who are willing to put in the effort and watch until the very end. Give it a try if you're in the mood for something obtuse.

It includes their most famous song - Fairytale of New York, sung in duet with the late Kirsty McColl, but there many other great songs, like If I should Fall from Grace with God, Fiesta, The Broad Majestic Shannon, Streets of Sorrow/Birmingham Six, South Australia. Obviously, if you want to have just one album of The Pogues, its greatest hits it's probably the one to buy, but this comes right next to it.
0060755598|4.0|E-Myth Revisited was assigned to me as a class reading project. I read slowly, so I purchased the book on CD. The material ties together everything a business student learns in coursework and brings the concepts to life in real-world examples. E-Myth provides very sound advice in a no-nonsense fashion. The reader/author's voice is a little hypnotic, which makes me sleepy, but fortunately I could \\"rewind\\" as needed and listen to everthing I missed. I love being able to do little chores while I listen to books, so the format is perfect. I would recommend all business students from any concentration read or listen to E-Myth revisited. Amazon hooked me up amazingly fast so my book report will be on time for sure.
0618001905|4.0|Adam Hochschild resurrects with much talent the forgotten story of the particularly brutal colonization of Congo in Central Africa under the leadership of Leopold II, the second king of Belgium, and his henchmen.  Hochschild gives enough background information so that his audience gets a better appreciation for the context of that saga.  Hochschild does not spare readers the atrocities that European colonizers perpetrated in the Congo Free State at the turn of the 20th century C.E.<br /><br />Hochschild excels in depicting the main protagonists of that story.  To his credit, Hochschild does not gloss over the shortcomings of the courageous men and women who helped expose the misdeeds of King Leopold II and his henchmen.  King Leopold II appears as a man whose greed, cunning, duplicity, and charm were a fearsome combination for any of his interlocutors and detractors.  Hochschild also reminds his readers about the importance of the media, especially the written press, in convincing the international community (read the West) to put Belgium under heavy pressure to take over the Congo Free State from King Leopold II.  Unfortunately, that takeover did not mean a total stop to the exactions committed against the local population.<br /><br />Hochschild rightly draws parallels between what happened in the Congo Free State and what occurred after the decolonization of Congo in 1960 C.E.  Congo confirms once more that history tends to repeat itself.  Congo remains a dysfunctional state at the beginning of the 21st century C.E.  Colonization cannot be blamed for everything that has gone wrong in Congo since 1960 C.E.<br /><br />Perhaps most importantly, \\"King Leopold's Ghost\\" is a shocking revelation to most Belgian people.  The book shatters the image of the king-builder and the benevolent character of the Belgian colonization of Congo that has been traditionally taught in Belgian schools.  It would be interesting to know what the Flemish, French, and German-speaking Communities in Belgium, whose competences include education, respectively teach to their students on that subject in the aftermath of Hochschild's book.  Unlike Germany, which has atoned for the Holocaust, Belgium has not yet dealt appropriately with the mass killings of colonized Congolese as Hochschild shows in his afterword of the paperback edition.competences include education, respectively teach to their students on that subject in the aftermath of Hochschild's book.

B000NVIXFK|3.0|Rush's latest album, Snakes and Arrows, continues in the heavier vein of their previous release, Vapor Trails. However, while that release had a lot of great songs and a lot of passion in their performances, here it sounds like the band is going through the motions. This is not a return to their glory years of the late-70's and early-80's. The instrumentals are back (\\"The Main Monkey Business\\", \\"Malignant Narcissism\\", \\"Hope\\") as is Alex Lifeson's acoustic guitar on many of the songs. However, none of the instrumentals touch \\"YYZ\\" or \\"La Villa Strangiato\\" although \\"The Main Monkey Business\\" grows on you after awhile. There are a few good songs here like the first single \\"Far Cry\\", the melodic \\"The Larger Bowl\\", and the progressive \\"Armor and Sword.\\" However, many of the songs (\\"Workin' Them Angels\\", \\"Spindrift\\", \\"Bravest Face\\", \\"Good News First\\", etc) rarely deviate from their sluggish tempos. All told, while the music on Snakes and Arrows is still better than most of the new stuff out there, this isn't up their usual high standard.
0060557818|5.0|Neil Gaiman has obviously read much about old myths and the legends of \\"old\\" gods. He has taken his knowledge and produced three (American Gods, Anansi Boys and Neverwhere)wonderful fantasies. Other reviewers have summed up the plot to this one so I won't do it again. I will say that the plots of the three books mentioned above are very twisty and the author strives to avoid the obvious, very often going off in an unexpected direction that surprised this reader at least. I read the three books almost one after the other and I will say that the protagonist in each bears a similarity with that of the others. That is, he is a quiet sort of lost soul who almost inadvertently tumbles into a fantastic world. That is not a problem with these books but I sense a danger of the author falling into a kind of formula regarding his books.     The writing style is as imaginative as the plot, an increasingly rare attribute in novels these days.     For those who want more of such superior urban fantasy(for grown-ups)I would recommend also, \\"Winter's Tale\\" by Helprin and \\"Saint Jack and Toad\\" by Carraher, both of which are also thoroughly enjoyable. [[ASIN:0156031191 Winter's Tale]] and [[ASIN:0741433249 Saint Jack and Toad]]
0893815233|5.0|I think the world owes Sally Mann and her family some kind of karmic debt for the beauty and grace that they share with us in this book. I know many of the shots were painstakingly staged and that her printing skills (and lenses) intentionally warp certain scenes, but this collection still allows you to escape into the feeling that you are witnessing an endless carefree summer in one of the most idyllic settings a child could imagine. The shots of her cabin and the river scenes alone could probably result in millions of unfilled prozac prescriptions -- it's that calming. I recommend this book to photography buffs, nature lovers, stressed-out insomniacs and mothers everwhere.

He gave me the book and I whizzed through it so that I could talk with him about it.  We did.  I found the book thought provoking and interesting at the time.  Since returning to the book a couple of times since my original reading, I've found the book rewarding.  There's so much more I wish I could talk to my uncle about concerning this book, but he's gone now. Ah well.<br /><br />This book can be enjoyed on a couple levels.  One, it's semi-biographical. There's also a sci-fi edge to it.  Obviously, pretentious blow-hards cling to it for... well... obvious reasons.  The ideas in \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\" are profound and hopefully you'll think about them for a bit.<br /><br />\\"Lylia\\"  (I think that's the name) is Zen's sequel.  While it too has strong thought provoking segments, it is windy and not too interesting a story... unless you're into sailing I suppose.  I'm not going to fault a person for passing it up, but if you have a chance to read \\"Zen and the Art...\\" and don't take it... well... that I can't understand.

If you've already started a business and you're struggling with either the one-man/woman show, or you're suffering from the growing pains of hiring help that isn't getting it done to your satisfaction, you'll find solace and very practical tips here.

Santiago, a shephard, discovers his purpose early in life, through a dream, which is to search for a treasure at the Egyptian pyramids. He meets several characters during his travels who prod him into fulfilling his destiny.  At times, the life of a married shephard, (Santiago falls in love during his trip)appear much at odds with his dream to roam the world.  However, his meeting and friendship with an alchemist cements his decision to follow his dream.      You have to read the story to discover the outcome.  I believe you will be pleasantly surprised

0307387151|1.0|Forgive me but, I didn't like this book at all.  Can't even get into it; have tried several times.  Wanted to read the novel (because it's what sold Keira Knightly on doing the movie) because the film isn't yet out on dvd.  Did not like the writer's style at all. Can't figure out who to pass it on to.  I know the author and the book have great fans; sorry not to be one of them.  But at least, now I'm even more eagerly anticipating Joe Wright's movie of same.    LATER: turns out I didn't like the movie either, except for the luscious and taughtly drawn first third (before it got bogged down in Dunkirk) and the last scenes of the movie with Vanessa Redgrave's marveleous performance. Actually all of the movie performances were good; and after I saw the whole film I listened to Joe Wright's commentary on the first third, and he's astute as always, but the final 2/3 of the movie was too slow, in spite of the acting. Too convoluted a conceit for me, I think, --to see everything through a thirteen year old child's eyes, or her memories (at a temporal distance) of what she saw in either enhanced reality, or later in her imagination.  Hard, then for the movie to stay rooted in the present. The only time I felt any real immediacy was the scene where Briony is sent to the bedside of a wounded French soldier, to comfort him in his last moments with her childhood/school days French.
B0002IQEHI|5.0|I noticed a number of reviews complaining about \\"bad discs\\", and saying the problem occurred in the auction house scene. Recently, I had a chance to see NBNW on cable TV in Europe. Right at the auction house scene the picture snapped from anapmorphic to 1:33. Manually resetting the aspect ratio worked for a few seconds, then it snapped back to 1:33. Once out of that scene the film held the correct aspect ratio for the rest of the broadcast. Intrigued, I bought a new R2 PAL DVD of the film at a local store. Sure enough, the exact same thing happened at the same place in DVD playback. All these complaints based on problems right at the same point in the film must be due to an error in the original transfer or mastering, as it seems the transfer, in whatever medium, whether on disc or on TV broadcast, is sending some sort of aspect ratio or film/video flag glitch to the display of the poor viewer. The PAL version of the film is anamorphic 16:9, whereas I think the US NTSC version is a letterboxed 1:33, but both have in common synch or playback problems reported at exactly the same point in the film.
B000002H70|5.0|disintegration is the ultimate cure album. it has everyhting that makes the cure, well the cure. there are songs of sorrow, heartbreak, lies, but also joy, eternal love and the ideals of word forever. this album was created as an answer to the reaction of \\"kiss me kiss me kiss me\\". Robert wrote this while the planning of his wedding to his wife, mary, was going on. Now this might sound bad but u have to know robert and it all makes sense. some of the highlights include: the whole album, there isnt a bad track on here so buy it now and thank me later!!
B000002KKD|5.0|I has taken me many years to get the cd version of the original masterpiece, but I finally have it.<br /><br />When I look back to when this first came out and how it caught everyone's attention in the school smoking area, it truly was an amazing time. This stuff was certainly something new and refreshing sounding and totally off the wall. Hell even the Zeppelin snobs like myself were diggin' it.<br /><br />Clearly these guys and girls had found a new sound that was just so bizarre it rocked! Over the years the B52's have put out some pretty good stuff, but this release is something special and was the one that got everyone's attention from the get go. Its pretty amazing it still sounds new today some 40 years later.<br /><br />Rock Lobster and Planet Claire alone are just amazing tunes and well worth the price of the cd.<br /><br />Great stuff!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000R7I3LY|5.0|It has been a LONG time since a new musician has grabbed me the way Sara Bareilles has. We caught her performance of Love Song on the Tonight Show and bought her CD on a whim. WOW! Now that I have read the lyrics and played along with my guitar (yes, she's that inspiring!) I am happy to report that the rest of the album lives up to the brilliance of the first single. Catchy melodies, great hooks and poetic lyric writing...  It doesn't get any better than this. Favorite songs: Between the Lines, Fairytale, Morningside and Gravity. If only we could still purchase that elusive first album... My prediction is that Little Voice will be HUGE.
B00005OCMR|5.0|Being from the Atari generation... it's clear to see that TRON was a revolutionary movie. This movie must not be judged by its inherent bad acting, and 'prehistoric' CGA sequences - but rather judgement based on the genious endevour depcting what might occur inside of a CPU assuming that programs, disk utilities, and general computer functions have conciousness.  A must for any techno-dorks like myself that revel in our computer age world.  This is where it all started. TRON. dont miss it.
B000OVLBFS|5.0|Anyone looking for Magnum P.I. in the Jesse Stone character should look elsewhere.  Tom Selleck does a magnificent job in his portrayal of a rough, very flawed, but brilliant sheriff as he cracks the case, but interacts genuinely with his fellow officers and the people he serves.  I enjoy this series and have all of the Jesse Stone DVD's.  PLEASE GIVE US MORE!  Terrific series!  Intense, dramatic, wonderful sound track and scenery...you really care about these people.  Don't miss this one!
0891419195|5.0|In simple powerful prose, E.B. Sledge recounts the horrors of the war in the Pacific in his memoir With The Old Breed. Dr. Sledge, who was a professor of biology at the University of Montevallo in Alabama for almost fifty years, wrote his book for his wife and children so they could understand what he had endured in combat. His wife realized the importance of his book and convinced him to publish it. It is considered to be the best memoir written by an enlisted man from World War II, and some have even put it in the same cannon of literature as The Red Badage of Courage and All Quiet on the Western Front. It is equaled only by the memoirs of President U.S. Grant.<br />  A native of Mobile Al, Sledge served in the Marines from 1943 to 1946. After boot camp in California, he was shipped to the Pacific. In his memoir, he admits that as his ship was nearing Peleliu, he was so frightened that he was afraid that he would lose control of his bladder and then the other men would know he was a coward. One of the biggest miseries faced by the men was the filth they were forced to live in during combat. Drinking water was too precious to use for bathing and brushing teeth and Dr.Sledge said it brothered everyone he knew.It is an important part of the stress suffered by the men on the battledfield that has not been given much attention by historians or even discussed in memoirs written by veterans. While he watched men die around him, Dr. Sledge survived the war. He was only twenty-two when the war ended but he would never be the same again. There is a picture of Dr. Sledge at the end of the book that was taken in 1946 after he had returned from duty in China. It is of a handsome man in full dress uniform with eyes that are much too sad and old for one so young. As World War II fades into history and passes into legend and myth, first-hand accounts like E.B. Sledge's are vital to understanding the sacrifices made by millions in defeating one of the greatest foes in human history..
0440236738|5.0|Absolutely Brilliant.  IMHO the author's best work.  A must read book for anyone into mystery, or fiction in general.  It will consume you.  A virtual lock.
B000MGVCFO|5.0|The Moody Blues were very much a part of my teenage years via all of that great AM radio. I thoroughly enjoyed every single I heard. But did I buy any of their releases? Nah. A few of my friends had them, but I couldn't understand what they heard in them. Single releases fine, but the LP's? Didn't get it. Also, they kinda dressed funny too. But then the summer of '71 came along and a friend had just bought \\"Every Good.....etc\\". Unbelievable!!!! Now I get it! And it's due to this album that I now know understand all that I had missed before. To this listener's ear, this is their PEAK! A stunning album from beginning to end. For anyone who is not familiar with the Moody Blues, except possibly the releases, I recommend this title in their catalog as a starting point. I should also commend this CD company for the fantastic job they've done on reissuing the Moody's first seven albums. They are all essentials for every collection! But if your new to it all, start here first.
B000OYC7A8|4.0|Yes, I like David and yes I think he's a fantastic guitarist.  Yes he owns the strat (that's \\"Fender Stratocaster\\" before you ask) and could probably make it dance across the stage by itself if he were so inclined.  And getting to hear \\"On an Island\\" in its entirity was wonderful.<br /><br />However, I can't help notice the pattern of the second set.  It seems the arrangements on some songs had bits cut out (most notably, \\"Shine On...\\") so that the guitar aspects are highlighted but the other parts are skipped.  \\"Echoes\\" (originally 18 minutes) is dragged out to well over 22 minutes and lacks the ferociousness of the original studio version (save for a great climax just before the last set of vocals).  Its great to see Richard Wright perform with David but on \\"Echoes\\" I do miss the wonderful organ during the build-up, replaced here with seemingly random tones and unorganized playing.  And during the song's close-out, where the two typically play off one another just before the ever-growing voices gently key in, David seems out of touch with Rick.  A better version of this is on the DVD in an Easter Egg where the last 6 minutes of \\"Echoes\\" is played during a rehursal with David on an Accustic guitar.  After I converted the tracks to mp3 files, I much rather hear this version than the ending of the live version.<br /><br />But enough knocking of \\"Echoes\\" (as I'm sure to get flamed for it!).  I did give this DVD 4-stars, however, because I did enjoy it and I do listen to it all the time on my iPod.  The sound and visual quality is supurb (despite getting speaker distortion from Guy Pratt's stand-up bass on no matter what sound system I listen to it on - probably my fault in that my settings are wrong).  I also enjoyed the accustical add-on to end of \\"High Hopes.\\"  David Bowie was fantastic on \\"Arnold Layne\\" (see the single release by David Gilmour and David Bowie) and he added quite an interesting turn to \\"Comfortably Numb\\" (as Rick says in the interview, \\"He took Comfortably Numb and turned it into a David Bowie song... and it worked really well.\\").  Another great thing about this DVD is hearing a live performance of \\"Wearing the Inside Out.\\"  Hearing that song performed live was great (still waiting to hear \\"Lost for Words\\" live, too, but oh well).<br /><br />It's a great track list and, with all the extras tracks and extra goodies(their are a lot), plus the Roger Waters run-in at a studio during the documentary, this DVD is a great buy and a must-have for Pink Floyd and/or David Gilmour fans.  I hope he does another!turned it into a David Bowie song... and it worked really well.\\").

0807126063|3.0|I know many many people love this book. I have read excellent reviews of it from many readers of it. But I found that I could not really get into it. It seemed to me as if the whole joke of the thing was there in the beginning, and it was repeated over and over. I did not find aside from an occasional surprise the book to be truly funny. In fact what I felt almost from the beginning was an underlying sadness and despair, a kind of desperation. The mixture of the low and the high which so many comment about did not really work for me. For I found the low just not very interesting.<br />I know I am a minority here. The writer Walker Percy who is responsible for the book's publication calls it a comic masterpiece. And perhaps he knows and feels and sees something I was just not capable of.
0894803123|5.0|Enjoyed reading the book very much.  Can't wait to try the recipes and save some money.
B000VWYJ8G|5.0|I am not much of a movie buff, but my husband and boys really wanted to see the Bourne series, so we watched them all. From the first to the last, all three delivered action, drama, and excitement. I was a little confused (i think that was the point) when the Ultimatum started, but it quickly came together and did not disapoint. There is action/violence in each one so my younger girls who are prone to being scared and night terrors did not watch with us (a good choice).
B0012K1ILW|3.0|Common, Cee-Lo, Andre 3000, Mos Def.  These four artist have something in common.  All three took risk during their music careers to try a different approach to what they're use to bringing out to the public.  Only 2 of the 4 artist I mention above have had success with taking a new and different route (one winning a Grammy for best rap album, the other nominated for Best song), while the other two artist didn't get much praise from casual music fans (one having to turn to Kanye West to redeem his career, the other still hasn't recovered from his experiment). Now we have a artist which all casual music fans should expect to take a different route with her music, the one called Erykah Badu.  It seems to me that people have double standards when it comes to artist who switch their whole vibe on another album.  It's like why can it be the same for all artist who make the switch? Music is about change, and if you expect the same thing with each album your only going to get bored and want more from that paticular artist (a la Common who seems settle with just Kanye West production and afraid to take another chance with a different sound).<br /><br />Erykah might not have that Dilla/Questlove feel to this album as she had with her recent albums.  She trades those in for (the new millinieum Dilla)-Madlib/ and former Little Brother member 9th wonder, to give you a very purplex style that works in most areas and miss in other areas.  She kicks things off with the Madlib produced \\"The Healer\\" which sets the tone for the rest of the album with haunting melodys and heavy baselines.  She goes back for a millasecond on to her old roots with \\"Me\\" with smooth groves and thought provoking lyrics.  Other notably impressive songs \\"Soldier\\", crazy sounding but addictive \\"The Cell\\", 9th wonder produced \\"Master Teacher\\" are great songs that gives you a new sound that casual music fans won't like.  But they will like the baseline heavy \\"That Hump\\" which many will pick as the best song on the album.  There were some misses like \\"Twinkle\\" which really felt like a filler, \\"Telephone\\" will put you to sleep, and \\"My People which when I first heard this song I liked it but could Erykah could've added some bars instead of making it a full chorus.  And the pointless Madlib movie sound effects could've been left out.  Still a nice balanced album from the one they call Badu.  If anybody can go out in left field and sound good its Erykah.<br /><br />Quick note:  She's coming out with 3 more volumes this year rumor has it so keep an ear out!! Casual fans don't give up so soon!!<br /><br />3 1/2 stars. Casual music fans beware!!! Everybody else, get the album!!um.

0452289963|5.0|Eckhart Tolle has gifted all of us with this most profound book.  The elegant clarity and connection of age old Spiritual principles allows so many of us an opening and/or enhancement of understanding.  This beautiful  guide to a \\"shift\\" of consciousness is a treasure to behold.  I personally am filled with daily gratitude for its contribution to my life.
B000000LZV|4.0|This isn't actually a real review I just wanted to commented on something somebody said. That this isn't punk. For one, punk isn't a sound. Secondly this is more post punk. Its DIY that's what is punk about it. Oh and this guy actually said \\"IF U PPL THINK U CAN HANDLE TRU HARDCORE PUNK THEN CHECK OUT OLD KORN AND LIMP BIZKIT P.O.D. OR STAIND.\\" lmao. What? Are you serious? True hardcore punk=old korn, limp bizkit, pod, and staind? There is a sound associated with punk even though punk its self doesn't have a sound. And that sound is defiantly not the sound of any of those bands. Minor threat, black flag, circle jerks, fear. Thats true hardcore punk in my mind (sound anyways). lol...limp bizkit.    Now, too the album. Not very many standout songs. I feel myself wanting to like it more than I do. It has a good bass and unique sound. I just think the songs themselves could be better. Though there are gems like corona and vietnam. I'm not sure I can justify buying this album at it's current price =/. So why the four stars? Corona and vietnam are hella good songs. Some others too.
0060730552|4.0|As many other reviewers have said, the subtitle of this book is true: the story is indeed miraculous.  The book is a quick read, and the terror, desolation and troubling moral questions of the experience are palpable.  I found myself squirming and uncomfortable at several points, and this is due mainly to Joe Simpson's talent as a writer.    It must be said that it is apparent that this is Simpson's first book, and this is why I deducted half a star.  There is the occasional awkward sentence, and the book ends on a pretty weak poker analogy.  Still, he displays a great clarity of insight throughout that easily overcomes these small problems.  His craft may be in the fledgling stage here, but Simpson clearly possesses a writer's mind; he is able to clearly articulate complex ideas and emotions in a very immediate, engaging way.    I would hope people don't dismiss this as a book for climbers or outdoor adventurers.  The story, as well as Simpson's writing, definitely transcends this narrow category and becomes a universal story of perseverance, moral ambiguity and courage.  There is quite a bit of technical description of climbing here--which is absolutely essential to telling the story properly--but as someone who knows very little about climbing, it was not a hindrance to me at all.  If you've seen even a few pictures of mountains, or caught a few minutes of climbing on the Discovery Channel, a quick read through the short glossary is all you need..you will find that things like cornices, abseiling, etc. are easy enough to visualize.    By the time you finish this book, you will be astonished.  Joe Simpson's torturous ordeal, as well as Simon Yates' battle with his conscience over cutting Joe free, make for a terrifying and moving story.  It's worthwhile to follow the book up with the excellent movie.
B000NA28I4|5.0|This movie was better than I thought it would be! I don't know when this movie came out, but I wished I would have seen it in the movies..I will be letting my friends know that this movie is a great film. Hope there will be a sequel...

B000IMV4IW|3.0|I am one of those people who've always thought the Gallagher Brothers to be one of rock's over-rated pair of siblings. They made two killer albums, [[ASIN:B000002AS3 Definitely Maybe]] and [[ASIN:B000002BBY (What's the Story) Morning Glory?]], then fell into the trap of believing their own hype. Once you get past the Beatles mimicry of their best single, \\"Wonderwall,\\" there's precious little here that suggests originality.<br /><br />Not like that ever stopped a rock band from being great. These two CD's make a case for Oasis being one white-hot singles band, even if they skipped [[ASIN:B000002C25 Be Here Now]] to do it. There's plenty of spot the influences to play here, from \\"Cigarettes and Alcohol\\" ripping off T Rex to the Stonesey swagger of Liam's vocals. There are a couple of anthems to be found here, like \\"Don't Look Back In Anger\\" and \\"Go Let It Out.\\" Oasis always did one other thing right; when all else failed, make a glorious big racket even if the song wasn't perfect (\\"Rock and Roll Star\\" or \\"Champagne Supernova\\").<br /><br />I hesitate to rate this higher than average, mostly because of the spotty selection. Noel and Liam seem to berate their own work - publicly voicing their distaste for \\"Be Here Now\\" for instance - at the cost of leaving gaps in the chronology. For someone looking to dig deeper into what Oasis is supposed to be legendary for, it shorts the band. For a casual listener, this will probably do fine. And frankly, getting those first two CD's will also probably give you all the Oasis you'll ever need.

0307237702|5.0|For anyone interested in Barrack Obama, this is a must read.  If you've followed his campaign speeches you will find the context from which he has fashioned them.  He's not carving his speeches out from the polls but from what he's worked on for twenty years.  This book will offer you the meat between the lines of what he's been saying from city to city and state to state.
B0012NVGHU|5.0|There's no other word for this movie except fantastic! I would put it up against any of the top releases. So moving! It is a must see!
B000X1Z0BU|1.0|I bought this movie after falling in love with the song and seeing the video.  I was not impressed with the movie though.  I enjoyed most of the music, but I expected to see a movie NOT a musical.  The copy that I bought froze, which hopefully was just the copy that I purchased.  The movie seemed to drag out and left the viewer waiting for something to happen.  I also found myself changing the volume throughout the film because of the inconsistency in the recording.  Once was enough for me and I LOVE independant films especially when they center around the UK.
0143038419|1.0|I think this is probably the worst book I have ever read in my life.  I purchased it at the recommendation of someone, not even wanting to buy it, but thought maybe I'd give it a try to give this person honest feedback.  I can't even bring myself to talk to this person, I feel I will never trust their opinion on anything else ever again.  This is absolutely the worst writing ever.  Horrible, horrible writing.  She is constantly using parenthesis to explain herself, good writers don't need to do this every few sentences.   She stops, if you can say stop because there is no flow to her writing, and says things like \\"let me explain something first\\" and \\"if you must know\\" and goes on about how she doesn't have time here to explain something, but why even bring it up at all?  You sure do have the time to tell us you're not going to tell us.    Besides the bad writing she tries to describe things and people and make herself sound really hip but she comes off as a lame, pampered, yuppie girl who doesn't know what's cool besides what the media and her lame brain has told her is cool.  She also shows us through her lameness that she's never had any real life experience so she had to go off and do some cool things and meet some cool people in order for her ego to feel credible and justified.  She is SO whiney.  \\"oh, cry cry, I'm so broke, by husband won't let me sell our mansion in Manhattan so I have to rent an apartment on the upper eastside\\" or some other such drivel.  I just really don't feel like having to suffer through the book again to get those facts completely straight.      This whole book is supposed to be about how enlightened she has become yet even at the end through her bad writing she displays how unenlightened, snobby and elitist she still is.  There is a part where she is with the medicine lady and someone comes in asking for help for their \\"god awful constipation\\" and the author writes: \\"I was thinking, Sing it a little louder, honey, and we can all danceto it...\\"  What?  You're the lame, rich, healthy, my-poor-suffering-soul whiney white lady sitting all day with the medicine woman in Bali, and you're complaining about hearing people with real physical ailments coming in for help?  Guess traveling for enlightenment doesn't teach tact, class, or compassion.       Eww.  This book was so lame I can't even pass it off to someone for fear they'll actually read it.  I only forced and struggled my way through it to make sure I would find nothing redeeming so I could absolutely bash it to the person that recommended it to me.  Richard, the character from Texas, says a few interesting things that she captured alright, but that's about it.  Do not waste your money on this piece of junk.  And if you find it for free pass it up anyway, please don't waste your time and energy on this.
7119005901|4.0|I bought the book with some background of the subject(s) so I had a good idea of what it would be like. It is written differently than most American writers' style, which may be weird to somebody that does not realize how authentic the subject and writing actually is. The book is very detailed and for anyone that loves Chinese history of the 150-200 AD period, this book will give you a good description of it.    The characterization and background of the main parties is very in-depth and you get a great idea of the temperaments for all the main characters.    What keeps me from giving this a 5 star rating is that some words are missed due to translation errors, as well as some poor attempts at dramatizing certain moments. Other than those few awkward moments, I am really enjoying the books. I love the story, characters and overall cultural depictions.
B00AMEZDK6|5.0|Fun movie.  No way on earth this would ever happen, but so much fun to watch.
B00003CWPL|4.0|Finally caught this last night at a midnight type showing. I'd love to give this all my thumb's up but a few elements within the movie I just couldn't take. One being the squiggly tape-wormish creatures that appear during periods of the film. Another being the menstruating miniature chickens and worse of all the alien looking newborn.<br />But.....and I want to emphasis the but, aside from those quibbles I was drawn and mesmerized by the whole of this film.<br />I loved the constant sounds of the film. The aural background. The steaming, the hissing, the industrial pounding. The black and white visual textures reminded me of the look of David's next film Elephant Man. Right from the start I was interested in Henry(Jack Nance)...his movements, his speech, his expressions. His small apartment where an old phonograph sits near the door and Henry will place the heavy arm on the black plastic which envelopes the room with an antique music hall caliope courtesy of \\"Fats\\" Waller. (the night before I had seen \\"Be Kind Rewind\\"). This music perfectly enhances the atmosphere of this scene. Spooky, really. And the needle skips back and forth at the end of the record as the circle goes 'round and 'round. But all of it....Henry's girlfriend, her mother and father, the sitting round at the dinner table. The frozen look on the father's face after asking Henry what's doin'. With the introduction of the baby my interest began to wane and when the scene where Henry is not allowed to leave his room for the crying out of the 'baby' I let sleep enter and I awoke with the final slicing sound from the soundtrack at picture's end. So, you could say I missed a lot. On the other hand, Eraserhead definately made an impression on me and I shall try to stomach the unpleasant elements with a further viewing/rental of the DVD.<br />update:march 25, 2008<br />finally did rent this. the dvd included an bonus interview with David Lynch himself. An extremely lengthy interview I must say. I do not know if all versions of this film on dvd provide this extra. But the interview is superb! David gives a T H O R O U G H account of the history of, the making of and his thoughts, opinions and anecdotes pertaining to Eraserhead. I learned watching this and listening to Mr. Lynch speak what a wonderful story teller he is.  There is archival footage of the actual shooting of the film too that screens while David is speaking. This entire extra bonus feature interview was a whole evenings watching all by itself. And, what do you know, I never got around to watching the film before I had to return it. But try and seek out the dvd version that comes with the Lynch interview. A must!ns of this film on dvd provide this extra. But the interview is superb! David gives a T H O R O U G H account of the history of, the making of and his thoughts, opinions and anecdotes pertaining to Eraserhead. I learned watching this and listening to Mr. Lynch speak what a wonderful story teller he is.  There is archival footage of the actual shooting of the film too that screens while David is speaking.

B00005N5S5|4.0|I also like this movie very much. Saw it in a theator when it first come out. That is the reason I bought it.
B000V79JKY|5.0|To my way of thinking, this is the best Motorhead anthology ever released. Every cut on this single CD is prime, and at 20 tracks you are not getting the abridged version. All the truly best stuff is here, with no extraneous \\"extras\\" to detract from the overall impact, plus outstanding cover art. It's a shame this disc is out of print, because nothing really compares to it. I previously had the original CD, which was eaten by my old CD player, and just bought a $40.00 replacement from Amazaon stores. Worth It!    This does not replace \\"Ace of Spades\\" as their best studio album, you can't be without that either. But the two discs together are da bomb(er)!    Beware also that this is NOT the same CD collection as \\"All the Aces: The Best of Motorhead\\", which has the same cover art. That is an abridged set from a multi-set collection, and is not nearly as good as this single disc.
B000ZN802W|5.0|When I first read John Krakauer's book, I was inspired by Chris's (or Alexe's) call to \\"get out now and do the things you've always wanted to do.\\"  He also mentioned that it is every American's right to see the Grand Canyon at some point in their lives.  It is because of this story, I took two train rides across the country.  The first ride was from Syracuse, NY to San Francisco, CA to see my brother.  The second ride was around the perimeter of the country where I stopped to see the Grand Canyon as Chris had suggested.  I also visited my brother Jeff one last time before he passed away in 2004.  I always waited for \\"the right time\\" to take this trip, but after reading this inspirational story, I decided that \\"Now\\" was the right time.     The movie excellently transformed Chris McCandless's journey onto the big screen.  I especially appreciated the scene in the movie when the old man played by Hal Holbrook took a trip up a scenic Gondola with Chris. With great acting, Emile Hirsch showed the expression on his face that Chris may have shown the old man which said \\"this is what life is all about, doing the things you've always wanted to do without giving into the limitations invoked by our societal norms\\".  Chris was with me on those train journeys in the same way.  His body may have been given to the Earth, but his spirit is still with those who dare to accomplish a supreme enjoyment in life without giving into the self-imposed limitations.  Thank you Chris, Thank you Mr. Krakauer for telling his story, and thank you Mr. Penn for creating this movie.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Sean Connery. Wow, he may be the youngest but the change from dark haired sophisticate to a younger less hard edged agent is a good step towards revitalizing the franchise.   Fantastic action. The story line is a little sparse but action packed as any Bond movie.
B000ULPFGS|5.0|A low visibility blockbuster.  Definitely worth checking it out.  Denzel and Clive are great in this movie.  I highly recommend this film.
B000DZIGDU|5.0|An outstanding look at the training of, and the life of a Marine.  I would say that the story line is quite factual, and that the  scenario is quite realistic..... including political intervention into  a combat situation.  I have told a Marine buddy about the movie and  he will be viewing it soon.  I fully expect him to agree with my  assesment. Semper Fi.
B000YPUF9W|4.0|It all really started back in the late 60's with what would eventually become a cult classic. A film-maker set out to do something that hasn't been, at that time, really seen on the silver screen.    The film-maker was George A. Romero, and his film was entitled night of the living dead.     It was, in essence, the birth of what is considered to be the `modern' style of zombie. Slow, virtually indestructible unless you destroy the brain, un-stoppable and insatiable.     A single bite and you're doomed to rise as one of the undead to forever more hunt for the flesh of the living.    Since that initial movie, there have been a handful of similar zombie movies. Romero is responsible for four. We've seen black comedy styles, in the form of the Return of the Living dead and the masterpiece that is known as Shaun of the Dead.     And then there is Resident Evil - a zombie trilogy that is totally set apart from the others in the genre.     Originally conceived as a video game, it quickly became a best selling franchise which spawned three movies to date. Resident Evil, Resident Evil: Apocalypse, and Resident Evil: Extinction.     Each movie progressed the story a little more. The first movie was set in an enclosed environment, the Hive. The second dealt with the T-virus, the source of the zombie infection, escaping into the city above the Hive, Raccoon City. Hell, if I didn't live so close to a city called Moose Jaw, I wouldn't have been able to swallow that name.    With the third movie, many years have passed. The infection wasn't contained in Raccoon City, it spread first across the continental United States, and then the rest of the world.     Resident Evil: Extinction is a true post holocaust movie. The few remaining survivors travel, never remaining in one place for more than a short period of time. They salvage what they can from small towns and avoid the major cities because of the undead.    The Umbrella corporation, the creator of the T-virus and the architect ofthe Apocalypse still survive, hidden in massive facilities all over the globe, trying to co-ordinate with one another to discover, if not a cure, a means to control the undead population so that they can one day return to the surface.    Of course, Alice, the heroine of the first two movies is the key to this returning to the surface and the domestication of the undead population.    But, enough spoilers for now.    The movie was action packed. The combat sequences are quite well choreographed and intense. The survivors are hardened and know what needs to be done.      The nice thing is to see the return of a couple of familiar faces from the second movie.    There were the inevitable plot holes that one would expect in any movie, and without really giving anything away, such as how there could be hundred, nay, thousands of zombies surrounding a fenced in facility and NOT cause the fence to collapse under the sheer pressure of the bodies surrounding it.     How dozens up dozens of zombies could fit in a single container...    Things like that.    They cut back on Mila's nudity in this one, upped the gore factor a bit, but not to the point you're watching another SAW or Hostil. Funny, I used that exact same line in another review.     Over all, I personally found it to be the best of the three movies. I really enjoyed it. And, as one expects, they left it wide open for Resident Evil 4. And you know something? I wouldn't mind it.    The rest of the review covers the two disk special edition DVD.     Once again we're at that part where I comment on the special features included on the DVD. First and foremost, you have the commentary with director Russell Mulcahy, and writer / producer Paul W.S. Anderson, and producer Jeremy Bolt.    There are five making of featurettes - Alice Vision:  Preproduction; The Big Bang: Shooting Resident Evil Extinction; Bigger, Faster, Stronger: The Undead Evolve; and Vegas Visual effects, and Beyond Racoon City: Unearthing Resident Evil Extinction.     My personal favourite of all special features are of course the deleted scenes, of which we're treated to a whopping eleven scenes, and as usual have varying degrees of effect on the overall plot of the movie.     There is also a very brief trailer for the upcoming CG movie called Resident Evil: Degeneration, which takes place seven years after the events in Racoon city.     There is a preview for the Resident Evil: Umbrella Chronicles video game for the WII system, and a preview for Devil May Cry 4 game.    Lots of great features, so check it out!    4 out of 5
0812550706|5.0|I know there are so many reviews for this book that adding another one doesn't matter very much.    But over the past 45 years, I've read over 500 Science Fiction books.    This is still my favorite.
0140861645|4.0|These comments are for the Freddie Jones reading of Hound for Penguin Audiobooks.  It's abridged -- the packaging doesn't make this clear; it's in fine print on the back. However -- it's a very good abridgement; unless you know the story practically line by line, the cuts are very unobtrusive.  My advice is have a copy of the print version, and listen to this one in the car or at bedtime, knowing it isn't complete.  Freddie Jones gives it a very good reading, absolutely drenched in Victorian gothic atmosphere.  I would recommend it.
B000MNP2K8|1.0|Somewhere, for some reason, someone at Sony thought it would be a great idea to add some sort of new copy protection to some of their DVDs.  Unfortunately, in doing so, these DVDs will NOT play on many older models of DVD player.  I have an older Toshiba player which does not recognize this DVD.  Sony's solution of \\"just buy a new player\\" is completely unacceptable.    I've heard the movie is very well done, but it does not appear I'll be seeing it any time soon.    (1 Star for Sony's idiocy, not for the movie.)
B000J66VSU|3.0|As you might expect if you're a fan of \\"A Cook's Tour\\" and \\"No Reservations,\\" Bourdain's writing style is brisk, flip, ironic, and (perhaps self-consciously) hip. \\"Kitchen Confidential\\" reads like an extended episode in which Bourdain takes you on a tour of his life. To his credit, he doesn't give a kitchen-god/rock-star revisionist version, doesn't glamorize the drugs and the squalor. Bourdain portrays his career as a coked-up stumble from one misjudgment to the next, and seems as surprised as anyone at his eventual success. \\"Kitchen Confidential\\" is no vanity piece. But reading the chapter \\"A Day in the Life\\" gives a glimpse of the enormity and Byzantine complexity of a chef's job, and makes you appreciate how much Bourdain had to master before most of us ever heard of him. Bourdain clearly loves food (and barely controlled chaos), and this chef can write. Is \\"Kitchen Confidential\\" a great work of autobiography, will Bourdain appear on a grad-school syllabus next to Benjamin Franklin, Anais Nin, and John Stuart Mill? Of course not. But if you already know you like Anthony Bourdain, you'll enjoy this book.
B000MRAAJM|4.0|Planet Earth is one of the most in depth nature series I have ever seen and I am a big buff. The video quality is utter perfection, however, it does switch from obvious upconverted SD to HD footage, but not often enough to be a problem or to spoil the \\"you-have-go-to-see-it-to-witness-true-HD\\" visualization (both artistic and technical) of the series. The only reason I gave it a 4 out of 5 was that although I am into nature and have learned a lot of trivia, I have to admit that one episode per day is about all the information I could intake, this being a personal preference. Overall, this series is wonderful in every way.
B000TX7B5U|1.0|Serj \\"sings and sings and sings\\"?  No - Serj doesn't sing; he talks, howls, grunts, and whines like he's trying to channel some inexplicable hybrid of Alanis Morisette and Boris Karloff...  Obviously, this is a question of taste, 'cause the average review here is stellar.  If you're into SOAD, I suppose you'll love anything Serj does, but when a friend tried to get me into this album, it made me wonder about my friend.  And, when Serj opened for Foo Fighters the other night in LA, I thought it was the absolute worst opening act I'd ever seen in my life.  Again, I guess I'm wrong, 'cause he was pretty well received by the Foo Faithful, but as his act wore on and on and on, I wasn't the only one growing restless for him to take off his ridiculous top hat and get off the stage.  I find his stuff devoid of melody, and his lyrics remind me of the kind of thing you might find written in a cynical, self-absorbed, pseudo-intellectual high schooler's journal.
B000TLMWMY|5.0|If you love music -- any kind of music----and/or have an appreciation for set design and art direction of the lo-fi variety, this is a must. Early 70s baroque, a bit of modernism, and an eclectic hootenany of good times. If you do nothing else, read the liner notes booklet.    JC's a bit Tennesee Dracula in his finery, and I loved every minute of it.
B00005JPOO|4.0|The premise is simple--there's a curse on the Vaderman family, and Penelope (Christina Ricci) is caught in its cross hairs. Born with a pig's nose and ears, she's lived her whole life in solitude. Her overprotective parents (Catherine O'Hara and Simon Woods) can't bear the thought of her being treated like a freak. So rather than let her develop character outside, they've kept her locked away inside their mansion, away from the cruel dark world. This unfortunately sends the message to their beloved daughter that looking different is the worst of all fates.<br /><br />There's only one way the curse can be broken. Once Penelope is loved by one of her own kind the pig nose will disappear. So her mother has made it her mission in life to find her daughter a suitable, blue-blooded gentleman to marry. It's no easy task. Every guy who gets close enough to see Penelope's nose in all its glory ends up jumping out of a window to escape. But then Max (James McAvoy) shows up with an ulterior motive, and things take a turn no one expected. Could he be the one?<br /><br />At first glance you might not think a movie about an otherwise beautiful young woman with a snout could be both entertaining and inspiring. It's true that in less skilled hands this film could've been comedic to the point of ridiculous. It could've overemphasized its message. Thankfully it's done neither. Penelope blends humor into its fairtale premise with all the right flourishes. Catherine O'Hara in particular delivers the best dead-pan lines. Reese Witherspoon's supporting but all too short role as a street-wise courier who befriends Penelope reminds us why America awarded her its People's Choice Award for Favorite Female Movie Star and Favorite Leading Lady in 2008. She's also one of Penelope's producers, so her influence runs even deeper than her performance.<br /><br />Viewers looking for romance won't be disappointed. James McAvoy delivers yet another terrific performance here as a scruffy, down-on-his-luck gambler. This time around his accent is American, and he pulls it off well. Though why an actor with a Scottish accent in real-life would go American in a film that appears to take place in Britain is a little confusing. And am I the only one who can't stop thinking of him as Mr. Tumnus of Narnia fame? Perhaps the stand-out role belongs to Peter Dinklage, a reporter with slightly nefarious intentions and a nagging conscience. Interestingly, Dinklage also has a Narnia connection. He's slotted to play Trumpkin the dwarf in Prince Caspian.<br /><br />Without giving too much away, let's just say there is certainly some predictability in the film's plot. But that's to be expected in the romance/comedy genre. Yet Penelope manages a refreshing twist you might not see coming.<br /><br />Rated PG for some language (h-- and d-- are uttered several times), and a few off color remarks, Penelope is still a film families can enjoy together. Maybe it won't win an Oscar, but Penelope's top-notch cast and redeeming storyline make it worth the drive if it's not in your local theater. Hopefully this little gem won't get lost in the shuffle of the blockbusters.<br /><br />--Reviewed by C.J. Darlington for TitleTrakkround his accent is American, and he pulls it off well.

B000OQF6N6|4.0|I have never been one to blindly exalt the Smashing Pumpkins despite being a child of the alternative rock era.  Many of my friends seemed to succumb to the hype that was \\"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness\\", despite the fact that it was seriously flawed, both sonically and musically.    Well, dare I say it, \\"Zeitgeist\\" might actually be my favorite Billy Corgan release (is this REALLY Smashing Pumpkins without half the original band?) since \\"Siamese Dream\\".  Now I'm not 100% confident in that statement, but I can say with certainty that I like this album more than Mellon Collie.  While the trademark Pumpkins wall of sound is evident here, it is a lot more accessible than on previous efforts.  There is actually something IN that mess of noise, and you can hear it if you listen closely! Heh.    I have always thought that Corgan sounded much better on the slower more sentimental numbers such as Disarm, Today, and 1979... and I feel the same way about Zeitgeist.  Some of my favorites include \\"Starz\\", \\"Neverlost\\" and \\"That's the Way (My Love Is).  It is also worth noting that Billy's voice is considerably less whiny (and thus less distinctive) than it was in his youth.  For some, this may be a welcome change.    Jimmy Chamberlain has, and remains, the most talented band member.  His snare is as distinctive as ever and crisp throughout the album.  All in all, not a bad effort!  Give it a try.
0440238609|3.0|The story line is interesting but by the third book it becomes a little incoherant.  We saw far too much of irritating characters and too little of intriguing ones.  Much has been made of the anti Christian aspects of the story line.  Even those while seeming to develop in The Golden Compass have deteriated to incomprehensibility by the third book The Amber Spyglass.  For a childrens book series it is remarkably devoid of hope.
0312379293|3.0|Most of Jeffrey Archer's work ranges from 3 to 4 stars--from middling to good, but not great, although he has some very fine short stories.  Prisoner of Birth is more of a 2 1/2 star book--there are just too many plot elements which do not seem believable.  Some of Archer's novels and books of short stories are on my shelves to be read again:  I suspect that Prisoner of Birth will get donated to my local library.  Archer can write well, to be sure, but the problem here is originality and coherence.    Danny Cartwright is arrested and convicted for murder:  4 wealthy friends have blamed Cartwright, a lower-class hardworking East Ender for the crime.  This occurs at the start of the book, and it bodes badly for what follows:  the fracas begins in a pub and finishes outside.  The wealthy friends claim that Danny was arguing with his soon-to-be-murdered pal and that they were minding their own business.  The bartender, the other patrons (this is prime time at a popular upscale pub!) and a taxi driver outside the pub who witnesses the killing either do not come forward or claim they saw nothing.  In a seedy joint where the patrons are anti-police this might fly, but here it seems a very long stretch indeed.  So Danny, who has no previous criminal record, winds up at Belmarsh, a maximum-security prison.  He is put in a cell with Alex Moncrieff, a former officer, who commanded troops in Kosovo, and against his orders not to fire, one of his squad shot and killed an armed insurgent.  For this Moncrieff gets 8 years in prison for murder? Hah?  The same prison also houses a psychotic killer and later a man with no previous record found guilty of possession of drugs (personal use, not resale). This seemed to me a strange collection for a maximum-security prison: made slightly more credible when I found that Archer himself had spent time there on his perjury charge.  Maximum security for perjury or simple possession? Ah, the inscrutable Brits!  Another piece that didn't seem right was that Cartwright was also stabbed in the leg in the fracas:  it appears that even though he was promptly arrested and kept in jail, nobody examined, treated, or even noticed this severe and bleeding wound.  This injury plays an important role later in the book.  These are just a few of the problems with the main plotline--too many coincidences, too many incongruities, too much that simply feels wrong and unlikely.    There are plenty of novels about someone who is wrongly imprisoned, who escapes, and seeks revenge. Archer picks up on Dumas, who in turn got his idea from another author.  You find similar themes--lots of them--in movies, on TV (e.g. The Fugitive).  Even O.J. Simpson (who was not convicted, other than in public opinion) keeps seeking the True Killer.  What is needed is a reasonable degree of originality, of creativity, to make it worthwhile, and Prisoner of Birth has neither.  Stephen Fry's fine novel Revenge (a.k.a. The Stars' Tennis Balls) is such an exception:  it's as surrealistic as Kafka's The Trial at times, and you'll see revenge that is truly diabolical--Cartwright's revenge in Archer's book is kids' play by comparison.  The rich man/poor man theme in Prisoner of Birth has been done by Archer before, and not just once.  So try one of Archer's other books instead:  almost all of them are better reading than this.
B000I5YCCO|5.0|This cd is great, I wish there were more tracks on it.  Each song is a hit!!!
B0011NVC9I|5.0|In the medieval ages of Denmark, the nobel king (Anthony Hopkins) and his village have been terrorized by the hideous monster Grendal (Crispin Glover) for many nights. Scandanavian hero Beowulf (Ray Winstone) comes to the rescue as he destroys the beast and becomes a hero, Grendal's sexy mother (Angelina Jolie) seeks revenge for her son's death and Beowulf must try to slay this creature or fall into her hands.<br /><br />Highly entertaining and wonderous CGI animated fantasy epic for adults! the film co-stars Robin Wright Penn, Alison Lohman and John Malkovich, this is a visually stunning animated feature for the eyes and imagination. Sure it isn't quite faithful to the poetic story but the film does have some cool photorealistic-CGI that is a slight improvement over director Robert Zemeckis's \\"The Polar Express\\" and as good as \\"Monster House\\". I think Zemeckis and company especially writers John Avery and Neil Gaiman have really done a well made and enjoyable CGI animated romp for adults loaded with animated gore and some nudity, it's great fun for anyone who loves fantasy and animation.<br /><br />This DVD contains never before seen footage that was cut out of the original theatrical PG-13 version and some good extras like deleted scenes, Featurettes, Art gallery, a behind the scenes making of and Theatrical Trailer.<br /><br />Also recommended: \\"Heavy Metal\\", \\"Conan The Barbarian\\", \\"Willow\\", \\"The Dark Crystal\\", \\"Krull\\", \\"Princess Mononoke\\", \\"Lord of the Rings Trilogy\\", \\"300\\", \\"Braveheart\\", \\"Dragonheart\\", \\"Legend\\", \\"The Princess Bride\\", \\"Fire and Ice\\", \\"The Black Cauldron\\", \\"The Secret of NIMH\\", \\"The Last Unicorn\\", \\"The Flight of Dragons\\", \\"Clash of the Titans\\", \\"Wizards\\", \\"Excalibur\\", \\"The Sword and The Sorcerer\\" and \\"Ladyhawke\\".
B0007LCNKM|5.0|This album renewed my faith and love in recent music.  I bought it a couple of years ago and, as soon as I popped it into the stereo, was unable to take it out.  It's rare (or impossible) that most people get to say this about any record, but I'm saying it:  it's on a short list of albums that have changed my life.
B00005JPTK|4.0|I read Matheson's \\"I am Legend\\" just a few years ago and I loved it.  I had read \\"Hell House\\" and I was just so amazed at the wide scope he could take in the horror genre.      When I heard they were making or re-making \\"I am Legend\\" I was really excited.  When I read that they were having it take place in New York I become a little suspicious as the book takes place in L.A.  What other changes would they make to the original story?    Well it turns out the New York setting worked quite well.  Seeing Will Smith hunting deer on Broadway or driving down the empty streets of America's most populated city had a great dramatic effect.    Much of the original book was changed however, some for better and some for the worse.  Most notably was the ending.      As others have pointed out, the first half of the film is just so powerful, packed with the shock of seeing what the world has become after this vampire virus spreads as well as the emotional plot turns.  The second half of the film seemed somewhat rushed to me.  Now I have no way of knowing in what order they shot the scenes but I felt that maybe the writing could have been better for the second half of the film.  For instance, and this may be a slight spoiler, the scene at the pier at night, I thought it would have worked perfectly if they had stuck more to the book and had the \\"civilized\\" vampires rescue him from the other vampires like in the book instead of how they did it in the movie.  But that's another part of the book they left out entirely; the different classes of vampires that sprang up.  Yes I know that Matheson never actually calls them vampires but we all know that's what they are.    Overall, this is a good film and I intend to actually buy it when it comes out on DVD.  There are few apocalyptic stories that I think pull it off and this is one of them.  The visual effects for the transformed New York are stunning though the vampire creatures could have been better.    Will Smith proves in this film that he's not just an actor who is suited for comedy or light drama.  His role in this is somewhat similar to \\"I, Robot\\" though so much of the film depends on him and he pulls it off quite well.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|There's just one thing I wanted to say:  Thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you.  Thank you so very much for satisfying my soul so thoroughly and exquisitely.  Now I know there's no trouble or pain big enough that can't be put into perspective by these songs. And no delight which can't be intensified by the perspective brought by these songs.  So, from the deepest of my heart: thank you. No one else is making this world as beautiful a place to live as you do.
B000Z27HLS|5.0|A wonderful Jane Austen classic.  I ran out and picked this one up, ok bought online via Amazon Prime :)  Love the characters the portrayals, the scenery.  Yah, it could have been longer, and more indepth, but I applaud Masterpiece for creating these gorgeous and sexy dramas.
0312360266|2.0|It is an easy read, a little too easy for me.  The actual plot moves very fast but then the story seems to slow down when it comes to describing the more tedious parts of the day.  There are too many pop culture references in the book, which I found distracting and did not add to the plot or the characters.      The idea of a vampire school for kids intrigued me but the book really is not original.  I thought of Harry Potter repeatedly (i.e. kid does not like home, is \\"chosen,\\" has a special mark on her head, and does not get along with the cool kids--think Malfoy).       I bought the second book in the series and started reading it.  I'm 50 pages in and already starting to regret my purchase.  There just is not much creative in this series.  It is certainly no Twilight.
B0012Q94QW|4.0|I LOVE primeval or primitive-type films like \\"One Million Years B.C.,\\" \\"Conan the Barbarian,\\" \\"Planet of the Apes,\\" \\"Beneath TPOTA,\\" \\"Sands of the Kalahari\\" and Tarzan, which of course explains my interest in seeing Roland Emmerich's brand new \\"10,000 B.C.\\" (even despite the mediocre reviews and the fact that I dislike other Emmerich films like \\"Independence Day\\" and \\"Day After Tomorrow\\").<br /><br />What does one expect in seeing a film titled \\"10,000 B.C\\"? \\"Citizen Kane\\"? No, you would likely expect raw, primordial landscapes, mountains, deserts and jungles, 'cavemen' (and women), chisiled bods with zero fat, giant beasts of terror and ominous music. \\"10,000 B.C.\\" has all this and, surprisingly, more.<br /><br />THE PLOT: The mammoths are slowly disappearing in the mountainous regions where D'Leh's tribe dwells, but when a herd finally appears he proves his courage by slaying one of the mighty beasts. Suddenly slavers from the deserts raid D'Leh's \\"village\\" (more like a campsite) and make off with his beloved Evolet and numerous others. D'Leh and three more pursue them into the jungles and then the desert. Along the way, many different tribes and peoples join their cause to end the tyrannical slave raids. The journey and climax brings profound spiritual growth to D'Leh as his \\"Circle of love\\" expands to include far more than merely Evolet, blood relatives and fellow tribe members.<br /><br />In a film like this I demand great locations and \\"10,000 B.C\\" delivers spectacularly! Seriously, the landscapes are so breathtaking that seeing 'em on the big screen is a must. The rugged mountainous scenes were filmed in New Zealand, the jungle scenes in South Africa and the desert segment in Namibia.<br /><br />Many of the visuals are just magnificent, like the slave ships and their red butterfly sails. Needless to say, incredible cinematography.<br /><br />Much of the F/X work is great, like the woolly mammoths, but the sabertooth tiger is a tad fake-looking, albeit serviceable. The entire mammoth hunt segment is incredible filmmaking and truly thrilling.<br /><br />D'Leh and his associates are all likable while the slavers & pyramid people are all fittingly loathesome. Great casting.<br /><br />D'Leh is played by Steven Strait and Evolet by Camilla Belle. You'll note that Camilla has one of the most beautiful faces you'll ever happen to see, especially in the close-ups near the end.<br /><br />Some have criticized that D'Leh's tribe speaks English (while other tribes speak different languages). Aduh, the filmmakers are hoping that viewers have a brain and can figure out that they aren't really speaking English (modern English didn't exist for another 9,750 years or so); D'Leh's tribe are obviously speaking some caveman lingo like every other tribe, but the filmmakers have translated their language for our convenience so we don't have to read subtitles the entire film.<br /><br />Contrary to what some say \\"10,000 B.C.\\" is not a remake of 1966's \\"One Million Years B.C.\\" (the one with Raquel Welch and her infamous animal-skin bikini). The basic plot is the same as Mel Gibson's \\"Apocalypto\\" but there's enough differences to make \\"10,000 B.C.\\" worthwhile if you've seen the Gibson film. In fact, even though \\"10,000 B.C.\\" is a bit more cartooney than \\"Apocalypto\\" you get more bang for your buck. \\"Apocalypto\\" may have more action but \\"10,000 B.C.\\" has a better variety of locations and breathtaking landscapes. Not to mention \\"Apocalypto's\\" message is simple: Civilization bad, rural tribes good, invaders from across the sea evil incarnate. (That last part's a joke, sort of).<br /><br />By contrast, \\"10,000 B.C.\\" surprisingly has a spiritual depth that transcends the usual action/adventure fare. Love is a strong theme here. There's a scene near the beginning of the film where D'Leh (still a kid) grabs Evolet's hand and declares his undying love for her. Unrealistic? Not really. Kids back then would naturally be more developed at an earlier agedue to the fact that they weren't spoiled or distracted from spiritual growth by absent parents, materialism, video games, Britney Spears, MTV and the internet (or whatever). Anyway, D'Leh's love for Evolet later propels him to take the long journey to rescue her and the other tribe members. During this journey his \\"circle of love\\" grows well beyond just Evolet, blood relatives and fellow tribemen to encompass many peoples of varying races and even a sabertooth tiger (!) (think Marvel's Ka-Zar, Lord of the Hidden Jungle). I wasn't expecting this.<br /><br />That's right, the film even adresses love and respect for animals. For instance, D'Leh has the opportunity to slay a ferocious beast but instead decides to save it despite the possiblity of being devoured or mauled. Also, his tribe regularly kills the mighty mammoths for necessities but they clearly respect the beast. Later in the film they are shocked to see the \\"civilized\\" pyramid people abuse the great animals.<br /><br />In \\"10,000 B.C.\\" love is like a warm life-giving ray of sun in a cold, rugged world. This is very different to the subtext of \\"One Million Years B.C.\\" which blatantly states (in the narration) that the world is a hard and unfriendly place. Generally speaking, the message of \\"One Million Years B.C.\\" is that life in this world is hard, hateful and meaningless, whereas the moral of \\"10,000 B.C.\\" is that life is indeed hard, but it doesn't have to be hateful, hopeless or meaningless, and love indeed conquers all (that is, if peoople are open to it).<br /><br />Some have criticized the many mystical elements in the story but, despite what Spock-like intellectuals would have you believe, life extends far beyond the limited parameters of science and reason. How do we explain the numerous mysteries of life and the universe? How do we explain the amazing prophecy the Aztecs had concerning Cortes and his arrival? A few years ago a prophet who didn't know me from adam called me up (from my seat) and spoke over me for a few minutes. He miraculously knew things and \\"predicted\\" others that he couldn't possibly have known apart from a powerful spiritual gift. People who view life exclusively from the narrow scope of reason and science are proud fools. Enough said.<br /><br />\\"10,000 B.C\\" is reminiscent of a few other films aside from \\"Apocalypto.\\" The slave raider's attack on the village strongly brings to mind \\"Conan the Barbarian\\" (in fact, the entire film has a strong Conan vibe) while the giant birds in the jungle recall the raptors of \\"Jurassic Park.\\" You'll also see glimpses of \\"Last of the Mohicans\\" here and there.<br /><br />If you're a fan of these pictures and primeval/primitive-style films in general \\"10,000 B.C.\\" is a must. Don't listen to the overly critical reviewers. No, it's not a perfect film -- the final Act falters, losing the captivating appeal of the first two Acts -- and, yes, there's a bit of cartoonishness, but \\"10,000 B.C.\\" surprisingly exceeds the superficiality of most action/adventure flicks with a profound subtext.th by absent parents, materialism, video games, Britney Spears, MTV and the internet (or whatever).

B000Q66PXE|5.0|If you enjoy history and historical drama, this is a great series for you.  Very high production values, real historical characters that come to life, and excellent writing make this a smash hit.  This series is produced by HBO, which is known for high quality work.  Also, this series has been highly rated by critics and the public.  You will see much violence, blood, and passion, which is an historically accurate look at the 1st century Roman Empire.  The are many characters you'll both love and hate, and will enjoy watching how they evolve as the story unfolds over the course of two seasons.  Highly recommended.
B000AOEMXM|5.0|Amazing series! I saw a few episodes on the sci-fi channel not too long ago and decided to purchase the entire series. It has been hard to walk away from and I'm hating the idea it will be over.. well, at least now I have the entire series, I can watch it again (and again!)

B000UX6THK|5.0|Its a Bewick's Wren, darn it! There were no scenes missing from my copy either.<br />Sorry, I just had to get that off my chest. Magnificent Gold Box from a magnificent television series. The sound was pristine with no dialogue degradation on either 5.1 or the original 2-channel. Now, I didn't get the post cards, but the vendor offered to replace or refund 10%. I took the refund, as I wanted to watch it then and there. This was the only issue that was close to being a complaint about this remarkable box set. The video was as crisp as I remember it when new. Fantastic package. NO flaws.

B00003CXB4|5.0|Ok, I love Disney.  I am a 22 year-old male.  I have no shame about the fact that I love these movies.  They were a part of my childhood, so now I am buying them.  It's just too bad I can't buy the Lion King brand-new because of that STUPID vault!!!  Sure, Disney has some genius minds that realize if they withhold something, people will pay more for it.  But do they really need to?  If my company had the money and assets like Disney does (considering they own ESPN) i believe that i would not lock up my greatest films just so I can sell them for 30 or 40 dollars five years from now.  True, it's a smart move but it makes some of the fans resent them.  I just wanna buy The Lion King.

B0011FXLCC|4.0|Honestly, if Seventh Tree wasn't Goldfrapp odds are I wouldn't like it and not even give it a chance, so I can relate to some of the naysayers. However, this is Goldfrapp so I know to expect something exciting and new and different.     Contrary to popular belief, this isn't a new direction in sound or style for Goldfrapp. It seems like those who are disappointed with Seventh Tree completely forget how quiet and ethereal Felt Mountain was. Remember Lovely Head? Paper Bag? Pilots? Those tracks could easily fit on Seventh Tree. Perhaps most of those who are disappointed jumped on the Supernature bandwagon, delved into Black Cherry and dismissed Felt Mountain altogether. Frankly, the shift in sound from Felt Mountain to Black Cherry was more of a WTF moment for me than the shift from Supernature to Seventh Tree.     It took a few listens at first to get into Seventh Tree.  This is definitely an introspective headphone album.  Upon first listen each song seemed to blend into the next with the exception of A&E with which I was already familiar.  Once I donned my headphones with the lyric book in hand, everything came together wonderfully.  Seventh Tree is a beautiful and hazy listen like dust motes in a ray of summer sunshine. Each track strongly stands on its own and evokes so much emotion. Many compare this to the works of Nick Drake and I can see that comparison but for me, it's Victorialand-era Cocteau Twins all the way.  Lightly strummed guitars, chirping birds, the faintest shimmer of electronics and Alison's purely angelic voice.    Read the lyrics along with listening to the beautifully dreamy yet funny opening track Clowns (which is about fake breasts) and see how Alison's voice shimmers and warbles nearly indecipherable words. The second half of Little Bird swoops and soars as Alison reaches a Liz Fraser inspired crescendo and her vocal delivery on Eat Yourself, amongst the softly strummed guitar and crackly static, is total Cocteau Twins.    Happiness and Caravan Girl are the most upbeat tracks that will satisfy those who need a substantial beat but for me I have always been a sucker for the softer side of Goldfrapp a la Hairy Trees or Let It Take You. It's refreshing to have an entire disc of slow and mellow tracks. Clowns is hands down my favorite track with Eat Yourself a close second. Other stand outs for me are Some People, Road to Somewhere, Monster Love and the second half of Little Bird.    Seventh Tree is likely to polarize Goldfrapp's fans like Black Cherry did, but as the lyrics to the closing track Monster Love says: \\"Everything comes round again, bringing us back again\\". It's lovely to see Goldfrapp coming back around to where they started.     Finally . . . the follow up to Felt Mountain.
B0001L3LUE|4.0|The Fog of War: Eleven Lessons from the Life of Robert S. McNamara (Errol Morris, 2003)<br /><br />What stuns me about The Fog of War is that Robert S. McNamara, unlike so many of Errol Morris' subjects, does not come off a moron. Rather the contrary.<br /><br />When you go into an Errol Morris film, you can be sure of what you're getting. Morris' directorial style is one of transparency (and, as Billy Wilder said, the best director is the one you don't notice); he sits back, lets the subject talk, and things take their course. Almost every time, the subject finds a way to make himself out to be a complete idiot. Whether it's coincidence that Morris often films some of the most hated people on the planet, or people in the most hated professions on the planet (in the case of the short-lived and highly underrated series First Person), I don't know. After all, most of us are morons.<br /><br />McNamara, on the other hand, is very composed throughout. If he's not entirely honest the whole time (and for all we know, he might not be), he at least comes off as someone who's earnest and unapologetic-- someone who stood up for the things in which he believed in the face of a government who were committed to stupidity. (Unlike many reviewers, I didn't see the \\"I am not responsible, but will accept responsibility\\" bit as evasion; I saw it as a grand \\"up yours\\" to society. \\"This ain't my mess, but you're going to blame me anyway. Why should I care?\\".) We're all well aware that Robert McNamara made mistakes during the Vietnam War. We're all well aware that he made decisions based on incomplete, or erroneous, data. (Those are far different from mistakes.) That it was too late to do him any good when he learned of, and from, those mistakes, is irrelevant. It seems to me that the point being made by McNamara-- and, by extension, by Morris-- is that the real tragedy here is that no one else, especially no one in the current administration, has learned from Robert McNamara's mistakes, either. ****
B000ZLFALI|5.0|If you are a Beatles fan, you will love this movie.  The songs, sung by the actors, set to a story, and danced to by all, sounded wonderful!

B000WQWPJQ|4.0|I liked the movie, good performances all around. While you can be excited for Hank's survival skills, you also know the inevitable. It is a very long movie, full of emotion, and for suckers like me that have to have a happy ending, this may be the one to skip.     Hanks is on a fedex job on Christmas Eve that he really doesnt want to do, but he does it as he is a workaholic. The plane crashes, and Hanks survives with the many packages in transit.     It was a good movie, worth seeing, but I wouldnt own it as I know seeing it once I wouldnt be in the mood to see it again.
B000XA5K48|4.0|It is amazing that this film is not rated NC-17.    I don't know how much down and dirty sex and murder you can have and still be \\"R\\", but this movie definitely pushes that envelope for all it's worth.   In any case, keep the kiddies away from this one and enjoy a full-on nitro-fueled rocket sled of a movie.   One of the most intense action films of recent years and a real treat for fans of that genre.
B00080Z53O|4.0|The Sea Inside (Alejandro Amenabar, 2004)<br /><br />When you know how the story ends, and you still can't believe the director is going to end up there, that's a sign of one of two things-- either the director has the message chip on his shoulder in a big way, or the director is very, very good at what he does. I suspect, where The Sea Inside is concerned, there's some of both going on here.<br /><br />Amenabar (The Others) gives us the (true) story of Ramon Sampedro (Javier Bardem, Spain's greatest export), injured in a diving accident twenty-five years before and paralyzed from the neck down since, who wants only one thing: the right to end his own life without anyone getting arrested for it. Arrayed against him are, well, all the usual suspects: his family, the church, the government. Added to this is a new friend of his, a disc jockey named Rosa (Volver's Lola Duenas) who saw him on TV and has added her voice to the chorus against him. As Ramon and Rosa get to know each other better, his longtime lawyer Julia (The Orphanage's Belen Rueda) starts getting jealous.<br /><br />It's impossible to discuss the implications of this movie in detail without spoilers; I'll try to avoid them by saying it seemed to me that, perhaps, Amenabar himself was less than satisfied with the way the case actually turned out, and leave it at that (any examples would constitute spoilers). This cast something of a pall over the movie for me, despite all the many things going in its favor. Javier Bardem is, of course, an incredible actor, and just about anything he does is well worth your time. The interactions between Bardem, Duenas, and Rueda, in their various combinations, are fascinating, and if much of the rest of the film had been trimmed away, they would still make for an excellent piece of cinema. Not that I mean to imply, though I guess I have, that the love-triangle aspect of the movie is of any prominence (or, for that matter, much importance) in the greater scheme of things; it's a grace note at best in the midst of a symphony. But this is, perhaps, why I have been letting this film simmer in my head for almost a month without writing a review of it until now; so many of the things about which I wanted to see more were in the background, while my original reason for wanting to see the film (which, for once, wasn't Javier Bardem; I consider Ramon Sampedro a hero, despite the ultimate futility of his crusade), which did take center stage, seemed to pale in comparison.<br /><br />A good film, but a tough one to rate. It's one of those rare movies that manages to be very good and yet still show plainly that it could have been so much more. *** ½t in the midst of a symphony.

B000ZLFALI|5.0|This is simply the best musical I have seen on the big screen in the last few decades. I am extremely disappointed that it was so over looked by the award shows as well as by the public.  The music is simply superb and creative while leaving the integrity of the Beatles originals intact - the core and the nuances.  The visuals were outstanding and the creativity fabulously unique as was the telling of U.S. history in the 1960's using the music of the Beatles (at the same time going through their musical evolution.)  This movie reminded me of what Billy Joel did in his fabulous production of \\"Movin' Out\\". The smart writing which often tied the characters to the original musical characers was really fun for the true Beatles' fan.  And, the chorography - outstanding!!!!   Costumes, outsanding!  Having lived through this time period and through the music of the Beatles, I feel fulfilled with this production.

B000HEWEDK|4.0|Forbidden Planet (Fred Wilcox, 1956)<br /><br />Interesting how much debate there is over whether this is a great film or not. I've been following it, admittedly halfheartedly, on the IMDB fora for about a month now. And both sides have some very good points. From the standpoint of moviemaking, it does wear its B-movie origins on its sleeve. The acting is competent at best and mawkish most of the time. The direction isn't awful, but it's certainly nothing inspiring (though this can be said of most sci-fi films; Alien and Bladerunner are the exception, not the rule). The script, which borrows liberally from both Shakespeare and Asimov, sounds more like a dime novel than either of its supposed forebears. Still, I can't deny that all that pales in comparison to the atmosphere that Fred Wilcox (Lassie Come Home) and his crew cooked up for this movie.<br /><br />The plot: Commander Adams (Leslie Nielsen in his second big-screen role) and his rather small crew have travelled to a planet where a colony had set down twenty years before, never to be heard from again. When they get there, they discover the colony's sole survivor, Dr. Morbius (Walter Pidgeon), and his beautiful daughter Altaira (Anne Francis). Unfortunately, they also discover something else-- the something else that killed the rest of the colonists.<br /><br />It's a pretty skinny plot, but you're not watching this movie for the plot. Much of what became standard, if not clich&eacute;, in the science fiction realm (thanks to the many knockoffs of this movie that followed, as well as the Twilight Zone television series, which reused many of the film's props and sets over the years) emerged here. And, yeah, a lot of it does look clich&eacute; now, especially if you're a big fan of Twilight Zone. But if you can think about it as a lot of tropes that had never, at the time, been seen before, you may be able to catch a glimpse of the magic here.  In fact, that so much of the film has become clich&eacute; in the ensuing four decades should tip you off to just how profoundly influential it's been. Couple that with the B-movie script-- and one thing you can say for B-movies, they were usually well-paced and fun, if shallow-- and the movie does still hold up very well after all this time. Bottom line, it's a lot of fun. ****ust how profoundly influential it's been.

B000GPIPT2|4.0|Frankenstein (James Whale, 1931)<br /><br />The first is still the beat in the case of the many film adaptations of Mary Shelley's novel Frankenstein, or, the Modern Prometheus. James Whale's 1931 classic has it all: a fantastic script, top-notch effects for its day, atmosphere in spades, a superlative stable of acting talent, and a director who was willing to take some risks. The result was a blockbuster, pulling in twelve million during the Depression (on a budget of less than $300,000, no less), and a film that has stood the test of time admirably.<br /><br />What is there to say that hasn't already been said? Seventy-six years after the film's initial release, thankfully restored (as much as possible) to the original state it was in despite the work of film censors in 1938, it's just as good as it was back in the day. Why? Because it's not just a horror film. There's a lot more going on here, and Whale coaxed every subtext out of the material he could. The idea that the monster could be the tragic hero, which became so prevalent in monster movies soon after, was adopted and nurtured by Whale and screenwriter Peggy Webling (one assumes that most adapters of the time would go with a straight good guy/bad guy approach), and it's done with flair. There are very few humans of any merit to be found here, and those who have any seem to come to bad ends relatively quickly (inadvertently, as in the film's most famous scene, or no); we're left with nothing but Boris Karloff and his neck electrodes to latch onto. And we do. Still wonderful after all these years. ****
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Uplifting is the demeanor you get to see when listening to this CD. It was a blur before but now....well. Let's just start here:<br /><br />When I first listened to this CD, I was like, OK. It's OK. But besides the single, a lot of the songs just came and went.<br /><br />Good thing I didn't sell this or give it away because deep inside the lyrics, the melodies and the piano arrangements, is a pleasant gift from Gavin to you. He's very, very smart and in tune with how he feels which is great to hear these days.<br /><br />Not that other men don't do this, because it's rampantly-common these days. But Gavin just has a way of doing it so, so, so well! So give this CD a chance! I know it took me a while to love it!<br /><br />I already rated the normal album with the second Stripped version and now I'm gonna do this. So you'll obviously notice that I like the songs much more now.<br /><br />Follow Through - 4.5 stars. I love this song. It's so innocent.<br /><br />Chariot - 4.5 stars. We've all heard this one a million times. Inspirational and features great piano and a nice arrangement.<br /><br />Just Friends - 5.25 stars. What I thought about this song initially has changed. It's a great, honest tale of a lying cheat. Gavin's still willing to forgive if they just put the thought in the past and they admit that they really do love each other.<br />I'm with him, but hopefully will only be stepped on once and then they're off!<br /><br />(Nice to Meet You) Anyway - 5 stars. xoxoxox<br /><br />Chemical Party - 4.3 stars. This is a good song. It speaks about a girl who has fun at a party and enjoys everyone but Gavin. He's drunk and she is high...too high to realize him. \\"I think I like you but you like this whole room. You sexy machine!\\"<br /><br />Belief - 6 stars. This song is kind of weird, lyrically, at first. But give it time.<br />\\"When you came to my defense with a knife in the shape of your mouth in the form of your body\\" didn't make too much sense to me then. But I've always liked the ending, continue to like it, and I totally understand what he means and is talking about now; love, trust, understanding, affection and sex. My favorite by him so far. Can't wait till the next album comes next month.<br />Mariah Carey is actually my favorite singer ever, and I'm looking forward to this release more so than her next!!<br /><br />Crush - 5 stars. Thank you, Gavin. You delivered another strong track. I love the composition of this song. Once again, good job!<br /><br />I Don't Want to Be - 4.75 stars. Gavin's first single. It's a great one at that. Gives off a good message. Tells the world that Gavin isn't afraid to be his own self. In fact when people expect him to be different, he totally blows it off and finds the power inside to stand out as him and no one else.<br /><br />Meaning - 5.5 stars. This song didn't really do much for me before...but now it's so not skip-able! In fact it's my second favorite song here. I just love the lyrics. And the falsetto notes he hits a few times.

B000M341QE|5.0|this is the best movie ever, i have seen it over 30 times.<br />i luv it.<br />watch it.
B0010358CG|3.0|alright...so ive been lookin around the web and find a lot of people who have a large number of complaints about the original appleseed from 2004.  IMO, the first was AMAZING.   The voiceovers, in english and japanese were if you ask me very well done.  the animation was unique and cell shading felt like the perfect type for the movie.  The new appleseed...Ex Machina, just didnt have the same feel.  The voiceovers are by new people for both Deunan and Briarious, and honestly, if you liked the originals, i dont see why you would like these.  i began watching parts of the movie and just didnt feel satisfied with it so i skipped ahead to just see the end and understood everything that had been going on through the rest.  No filler felt needed and everything just seemed so...rushed?   My other big complaint, in the first appleseed there is a short clip (dream from Deunan's perspective) which shows a bit of Briarious and if you ask me, in this movie, his 'clone' looked far from the same.       This is all just my opinion.  I loved the first one and would reccomend either a rent or download this.  Not worth the 20 dollars and space it takes to keep.
B00008RH3L|4.0|Miller's Crossing (Joel Coen, 1990)<br /><br />I've seen piece of Miller's Crossing many, many times over the years, but somehow I'd never gotten round to sitting down and watching the whole movie until recently. I think this has to do with my ambivalence towards the Coens, who are capable of cranking out an amazing film one day and an awful one the next; I'm never quite sure what I'm going to get. I'm quite happy that both my last two Coen experiences (this and No Country for Old Men) have been more than satisfactory.<br /><br />Gabriel Byrne plays Tom Reagan, a triggerman for crime boss Leo O'Bannon (Albert Finney). As the movie opens, Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito) is asking O'Bannon for license to kill Bernie Bernbaum (John Turturro). O'Bannon refuses; Bernie is the brother of Verna (Marcia Gay Harden), Leo's girlfriend. Caspar and his loyalists go rogue, setting up their own shop; when it's revealed that Reagan has been having an affair with Verna, O'Bannon ejects him from the gang, and he, too, goes over to Caspar's outfit, which is now struggling with O'Bannon's for control of the city. Between gobs of flying bullets, Caspar's right-hand man Eddie Dane (J. E. Freeman) is embroiled in the mystery of where Reagan's loyalties truly lie; is he loyal to Caspar? An agent for O'Bannon? Or, most dangerously, is he loyal only to himself?<br /><br />Loosely based on two Dashiell Hammett novels (The Glass Key and Red Harvest), Miller's Crossing is a fast-moving, violent look at the golden age of the gangster that manages to be a lot more at the same time. Barry Sonnenfeld's cinematography, on the penultimate film before he moved to directing, is a joy to watch. (Please, Barry, go back to cinematography. It's something you're good at.) The script is sharp, by turns funny and heart-wrenching, and the actors are uniformly excellent. This is good filmmaking, pure and simple. ****
0060987464|5.0|I had a roommate in college that used to wake me up to \\"Smells like Children\\", it was the most insane thing I had heard at that point.  She kind of scared me a little with all that!  Now years & years later, I am an avid fan of Manson.  I got the book on a whim, I had just seen him live for the 3rd or 4th time & thought I'd like to finally read it since it's been out for so long. So when I ordered my husband's birthday presents I ordered the book for myself.  I could not put it down!     This is a captivating book!  I find myself looking at 'Manson' now as Brian, a human who feels, loves, & hurts.  With this telling of his lifestory hopefully more people will realize that he's just trying to open your eyes to the hate & craziness around you, not bring it into your life.
B000PKG7I4|5.0|Very good CD.  You can listen through it the whole way through.  Calm and mellow.
B00004RITP|1.0|As usual, Simon Rattle ticks all boxes. All meticulously done and calcurated, and manages to kill great spirit of Mahler's music as happened to most of Rattle's Mahler recordings. Where is warmth of humanity, violent primeval force, and spiritual depth so essential to Mahler symphonies? This is a prime example that most of conductors today can not match greatness of the music.
B00004THAY|3.0|Riding With The King is a CD that sounds exactly like what it is: A blending of BB King and Eric Clapton. Bringing these two guitar legends together makes for a good album, but there are no surprises or anythng unexpected. It's a solid blues-fest. I picked this up here on Amazon used (very cheap like a dollar) because I'm a big Clapton fan that respects but doesn't listen to a lot of BB King. So this is a cool CD for my collection, but not one I'll listen to every day.
6305428220|4.0|I remember seeing this movie when I was 15 and it creeped me out. Having seen it again recently, it's still good. It is clever, not too gory, and the suspense was perfectly built up. It was written by Kevin Williamson, who brought us Scream. Highlights in this movie for me were Elijah Wood's Casey, Bebe Neuwirth's Principal Drake and Josh Hartnett's Zeke. The rest of the cast is fairly amazing as well: Jon Stewart, Robert Patrick, Usher and even Piper Laurie (who starred in the original high-school horror movie Carrie). It is a little cliched at times, but moves at a pretty quick clip and when it was over I was not disappointed.
B000RJO578|4.0|This is a great homage to the \\"classic\\" buddy-cop movies and film, with references to [[ASIN:B00018D3RI Starsky & Hutch]], [[ASIN:B00005JLEY Miami Vice]], [[ASIN:B000GUJZ4G Point Break]] and the [[ASIN:B00004STUL Bad Boys]] franchise.  Simon Pegg is the stud, and Nick Frost is the (apparent) dud, and as expected they both mature, learn a bit on the way, and become friends as they solve the mystery and take the bad guys down, down to downtown, baby.<br /><br />There's quite a bit of British English slang throughout the film, so pay attention.  It's not nearly as challenging to decipher as [[ASIN:B0002ZMITY Ali G Indahouse]] or [[ASIN:B0001XALTG Trainspotting]], but if you're not listening you're not going to get it.  This is especially true when they're interacting with the locals, and with the crew at the precinct, while not as quite as wacky as [[ASIN:B0001XAODE Reno 911]], still a great bunch of interesting and funny supporting characters.<br /><br />The story is as predictable as can be, but still fun.  It was clear from the very beginning who the bad guys were, and where the film was headed, and it just seemed to me to take a little bit too long to get there.  The big shootout and chase at the end were great, but left me feeling a bit disappointed (more below).<br /><br />The violence:  This film was positively schizophrenic when it came to its violence.  Given [[ASIN:B000R8YC3G Shaun of the Dead]], I expected at least the same level of violence, but this time with a lot more guns.  The deaths of the hapless murder victims were as bloody as you can get, progressively so, more graphic that Shaun of the Dead, but not quite to the masturbatory excess of [[ASIN:B000UAE7O0 Grindhouse Presents, Planet Terror]].  The one scene where the cathedral stone falls on the reporter is so over-the-top bloody it's absolutely hilarious, but as comical as it is, it's still quite graphic.  And when it finally comes time for payback with the murderers--and we know that they deserve it--there is almost no blood whatsoever.  Pegg and Frost blast away at the bad guys with a cop-movie-appropriate arsenal, but nobody gets blown away; there is no [[ASIN:B000GGSMB2 Scarface]] bullet-dance, no bloodbag squibs going off in glorious succession.  It's as hokey as the Lone Ranger winging the bad guy with a single shot to the wrist so he'll drop the gun and be all docile and recalcitrant for his ride back to town.  It's a very strange dichotomy; all of the innocent victims are not-coming-back dead, while none, not a single one of the murderers ends up that way.  Yeah, I know Pegg's character is the good guy and won't kill unless he's forced to, but come on.<br /><br />You could argue that this film has been softened up from the relative honesty--Shaun having to kill his zombie-mom--of Shaun of the Dead.  That's what happens when you're aiming for a wider market; you start worrying about demographics who could be turned off or otherwise offended by your content.  It's not a sellout, not quite, but it seems to be trending in that direction.<br /><br />The shoot `em up was okay, but the entire cast could have done a few more days worth of intensive practice with their weapons.  You can tell England has a ban on firearms, the way both the men and the women were carrying and employing their weapons, even the cops.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the office scene in which Pegg is sent off to Boring-Upon-Stoat, with each succeeding superior--Martin Freeman, Steve Coogan and Bill Nighy--stepping in as anticipated, planned and rehearsed to tell Pegg to shove off.  That's some serious British comic horsepower interacting there, and the gag reel shows just how good it was.<br /><br />The DVD extras were pretty good.  The deleted scenes were surprisingly good, not the typically dry, boring and terrible stuff that you get.  The goofs and gags were excellent, really funny, delightfully vulgar, and went on for a good long time--this is the way a gag reel should be done.  Andkeep your eyes peeled for the Cate Blanchett and Peter Jackson cameos.<br /><br />Bottom line:  This is not Shaun of the Dead with a change of wardrobe.  While the buddy aspect is still there between Pegg and Frost, its development is different, and arguably better done.  The story is predictable from the outset, but that does not lessen the laughs one bit.  It's a fun and easy story, told well and very comically, with some highly cheesy gore to spice things up, and a satisfying blowout at the finish.Jackson cameos.

B0013D8LOU|5.0|I've been a fan of Sondheim's musical Sweeney Todd for a long, long time. It's one of the few Broadway musicals that appeals directly to my sensibilities and pulls no punches. No sappy love story this; though love certainly plays it's part in a twisted fashion. This show has none of the typical trappings of musical extravaganzas. It is a show ripe with daring escapes, lust, revenge, duplicity, mischief, and murder...lots and lots of murder! Even the dietary elements of the show have a machismo that cannot be denied: greasy meat pies served with generous quantities of ale.<br /><br />I was thoroughly delighted when Tim Burton was named as the director of the screen version of this great show, and hopefully expectant when Johnny Depp was chosen for the title role. The rest of the casting was masterful - brilliant choices throughout. Notable actors rounding out the cast included Helena Bonham Carter as Mrs. Lovitt, Alan Rickman as Judge Turpin and Timothy Spall as Beadle Banford - all familiar faces from the Harry Potter movies. Some key roles were filled by relative unknowns: Jamie Campbell Bower as Anthony, the gorgeous Jane Wisener as Johanna and perhaps most impressively, a very young Ed Sanders as Toby. The casting coup of the entire movie was Sacha Baren Cohen as the smarmy, vile barber Pirelli. He quite nearly stole every scene he was in - anybody less charasmatic than Depp would certainly have been overshadowed.<br /><br />I admit to being somewhat concerned that Depp and Bonham Carter wouldn't have the necessary singing chops to carry off such powerful roles. Truth be told, if this were a play on Broadway they probably wouldn't have been able to pull it off. But this is a movie and projecting their voices to the third balcony wasn't a concern. Their somewhat quieter voices worked remarkably well in this context, especially since Burton shot many of the shots in mid to extreme close-up. Mrs. Lovitt's voice seemed a bit whispy at first, but after about ten seconds, it didn't bother me in the least.<br /><br />As for the look of the movie...perfect in every sense. The signature gloomy groddiness of many Burton films was the ideal setting for this dark and disturbing movie. As would be expected, every detail seemed completely appropriate to the time. From the clanking gears as the Tower Bridge on the Thames river rose, to the imperfect glass panes in the buildings, to the festering sewers under the city, it all seemed real and plausible. Thank goodness they haven't introduced digital smell, as I'm sure it would have stunk to high heaven!<br /><br />This movie did not disappoint in any respect. This is one of the best movies of the year and quite possibly the best Burton film of all times. I suspect it won't achieve the popular success it deserves (I couldn't get my 16 year old son to go with me.

0670034711|4.0|This was written by a talented author who got paid to travel for a year and produce this book. Both good things and bad things came out of this.    The book has three parts and the quality of the writing is unequal between them. The first part - about Italy - is good, even delightful at times, as she explores the country in an unconventional way, by learning the language and trying the food instead of doing the regular sightseeing. The second part - about India - is like a slap in the face. She's obviously interesting in meditating at the ashram, but the talk about God finds her rather unprepared. She had to fill up pages with something, and it came out quite boring (It also made me think she was paid by the number of pages). The third part - about Indonesia - really gets better, although not as good as the first. There are some interesting characters and things happen, though you can tell that people there are just not that complex or refined.     Four stars for the good parts and some thought provoking ideas to be found in there.

B000ZN8036|5.0|I was taken by surprise completely by this excellent movie. All the critical reviews were very good, but, even so, I expected some kind of light family entertainment (and that's exactly what you would expect if you ever watched the trailer, so don't get fooled by it).     It was much much more, one of the most beautiful movies ever made, and very touching and moving. None of the 2007 movies produced the same effect, and had me thinking about what I watched even days afterwars.     Here's a movie that has been ignored (in Hollywood's high places, not by the critics or the public). I don't know why. Is its message about nature and the place of man in it a little old-fashioned for Hollywood? Is violence a cooler topic? I don't know, maybe they're just ignoring director Sean Penn for being rebel and outspoken.    This coming of age tale is a travel of self discovery, that has to do not only with nature itself, but equally with human nature. Through the experience of Chris McCandless (the real person that inspired the movie), we are faced with the question of how our relation with nature has to be. Maybe the biggest mistake of Christopher was to think that it demanded total detachment of social relationships, and in the end he may have learned a valuable lesson. And we become completely identified with his adventure.    I really didn't expect this kind of movie from somebody like Sean Penn, whom I would associate more with political or controversial projects. This movie is a culmination of a labor of love of his, that took 10 years to finally see the light. I admire the great respect with which he treated the subject, because he leaves space for us to draw our own conclusions.    Is it a little heavy handed? Maybe. Is McCandless portrayed as a \\"too good to be true\\" person?. Maybe in some instances. But none of this elements distracted me of the real deal here: we get the message through the EXPERIENCE of the character, not through his wisdom. We don't lose sight for a moment that he's an unexperienced youung man, even naive, someone that in the end gets a lesson the hard way. He's so blind that he doesn't realize that the interaction he had with other people while he was travelling was a clue to his search.    If the message is heavy handed, for some, well, that was the way Sean Penn wanted to present Christopher's story. That doesn't diminish the story's merits.     Emile Hirsh, as the main character, carries the movie really well. A physical combination between Jack Black (come on, look at his face) and Leo DiCaprio (his manners, his voice), he has made a breakthrough performance with this movie, and is one of the stars to pay attention to in the near future.    Kudos also to Eddie Veder for his songs, so well placed into the movie. His merit is to have composed the songs, but Sean Penn, leaving space for them, has shown how sung music has to be inserted in a movie, a long lost art in movie making.    I didn't find very much in the SPECIAL EDITION to justify its existence as a separate item. I mean, there are two very interesting documentaries, one about the story (but from the point of view of the people who participated in the film, not documentary-type), the other about the filming, but they are relatively short (over 17 minutes each) and along with the trailer included, they could have been put in a single disc with the movie. So this is what I call a \\"forced\\" special edition. This specific version is an item only for completists who are willing to spend some dollars more.

B000G759LW|5.0|The Back to Basics Intro pretty much sums up how the listener feels after listening to the first note of this record.     As a Christina fan from the very beginning, I have been continually amazed by her versatility. Whether it be bubble-gum pop, soul, gospel, r&b, or even hard rock, Miss Aguilera has always pulled it off perfectly. Her changes always go beyond the studio and into her appearance, so when the world saw The Artist Formerly Known as Xtina ditch her assless chaps and dreads in favor of a \\"Baby Jane\\" title, Marylin platinum curls, and siren-red lips, I knew the record would be something unlike anything the world has heard before from the multiple Grammy winner.    Back to Basics does not disappoint. Some criticize the record for being less-personal and raw than Stripped, but really, it is just as honest as the previous record. The only difference is, the artist in question is just happy now.     The newly married Mrs.Bratman is clearly finally finding inner peace, and her husband's love has cured the previously visible emotional scars from her tumultuous childhood.    Songs celebrating her love for her husband and new outlook on life dominate much of the first disc, with songs like \\"Makes Me Wanna Pray\\", \\"Without You\\", \\"Understand\\", and, of course, the Grammy-winning \\"Ain't No Other Man.\\"    Since Christina refrains from parading her private life in the public, some songs also serve to send messages to her fans about her life. \\"F.U.S.S.\\" is a completely skippable track, but it serves to answer the lingering questions concerning Scott Storch. \\"Thank You\\" is also by no means a hit single, but it's sweet and nicely brought to life in concert.     Many tracks, for that matter, are clearly meant for perfoming. \\"Nasty, Naughty Boy\\" is not much to listen to on the album, but when seen live on her Back to Basics tour, you realized why the song was there. The same applies for \\"Welcome\\", and the two intros.    Overall, Back to Basics is different, fun, and a display of stunning talent. I speak for many of us when I say that we cannot wait to see what the next album will be like, especially since she is now going to be writing from a totally new perspective: Mommy Christina.    Stand-out tracks are:  (Disc 1):  Ain't No Other Man  Understand  Oh Mother  Without You  Still Dirrty  Here To Stay    (Disc 2):  Hurt  Mercy On Me  Candyman  Save Me From Myself

B000O75F7C|5.0|The more I delve into the utterly daft but still hugely popular 'prog' sub-genre, the more I feel manipulated and ever-so-slightly seduced. It's all very glamorous and mystical of course and the more I hear of it (as if the music's important!), the more I feel myself slowly initiated in.<br />It's like art-quicksand: the more you resist and deny, the further you get ever-so-gently pulled in.<br /><br />Thing is; I'm enjoying myself immensely. The music just comes in floods, sweeping me along deliriously. I feel like a grinning Robinson Crusoe, shipwrecked from the security blanket of my punk, indie and art-rock, but loving every second of the isolation. My dreams are now in colour too....(yeah, I know)<br /><br />So far 'Inner Marshland', 'Going for the One' and the superb 'Blues for Allah' have entranced and mystified me, I feel like I'm passing tests and now this Porcupine Tree are another challenge on the horizon;<br />So, deep breath, 'FOABP' (yes, and I'm not a bit shocked..) is outstanding in every department. It's fierce, gentle, haunting, cinematic, brazen (lol!), profound etc etc.<br />It's like a good-music intravenous, as I lay dazed and confused in the Garcia Clinic for people who thought they were years ahead, but are really just catching up.<br /><br />'FOABP' is SO good (in a modern sense) it's almost un-reviewable. If it was born in the 70's lets say, I'd be standing on my tail on this very page, telling you how they don't make 'em like this anymore; another satisfactory category for 'FOABP'.<br /><br />It's got fiery rock guitar, vast banks of whirling string-synth, staccato drumming, and a vocals-man, who obviously understands the lunacy of it all, singing brilliantly tongue-in-cheek lyrics with deadpan seriousness. Irresistible combination that takes some topping.<br /><br />If prodded with something sharp, I'd say 'My Ashes' is my favourite song on 'FOABP', but it's a close run thing (Important point here pop kids: 'FOABP' deals in the song side of 'prog', not like that utter waste 'the Wall', that deals in pretension and regressive self-congratulation).<br />The 17 minute (feels like 5, you just don't want it to end!) 'Anesthetize' is obviously the centre-piece and HAS to be superb to fend off all the other goodies which are attacking it from all sides, and 'Sentimental' is another classy ballad. Sort of 'My Ashes'2, with ethereal piano driving it along to a strutting conclusion. I really can't fault it (and believe me, I've tried!) and this is no knee-jerk notice; I've inhabited said Blank Planet for a good two months now; each sojourn bringing new, previously undiscovered jewels. Yes, it does THAT as well.<br /><br />So (breathless reviewer pulls himself together), must go. Things to do, life to be lived etc; everything doesn't revolve around 'FOABP' y'know. Ha.<br />Just one more spin....hat deals in pretension and regressive self-congratulation).   The 17 minute (feels like 5, you just don't want it to end!)

B00005NTNM|3.0|I know there are 5 films with Clint Eastwood playing the \\"Dirty Harry\\" role,but because of the time between the third and fourth installment and the commercialization of the franchise, I only really look at the three Dirty Harry films from the 70's as part of the series.    I don't need a complexed plot to enjoy a Dirty Harry film. Clint Eastwood acts fine in California based cop flicks with little dialogue as he did in his great Westerns during the 60's. There is decent shot-popping action in \\"The Enforcer\\" as Callahan and it is surely a watchable and not boring film.    If you are looking for a continuation of the Cop vs. Bureaucracy tale that made the original \\"Dirty Harry\\" so compelling, you may come away unsatisfied as \\"The Enforcer\\" tacitly embraces some of the PC stupidity so cleverly attacked in the first go-around. It's a bad move for the franchise and the world introducing future \\"Cagney and Lacey\\" star Tyne Dailey as Harry's quota-hire female partner. Subtle message here is one of \\"gender equality\\" and shows Callhan developing deep respect for the lady cop he was reluctant to work with. Maybe Eastwood wanted to do something he hadn't done in the first two Harry flicks and show some sensitivity and maybe even deflect some of the media criticism of his macho and rule bending character.There's not that much of the PC nonsense, but enough to make one wish they took a script another way.Preach in church, not in action movies..  Good villians help me forgive the PC pandering undertone. Lunatic leftist revolutionaries styled after Patty Hearst kidnappers the Symbionese Liberation Army are the culprit here, with a full-70's ambition of helping the poor fight \\"the man\\" and \\"off the pigs\\". Nice appearance by Robert Mitchum brother John as a fellow lawman.

0812550757|5.0|Orson Scott Card does it again! Speaker for the Dead is a must read for sci-fi lovers. However, this series isn't solely for those fantasy lovers out there. This series of books is about much more. If you want a good book to read that will keep you interested from the first sentence...read this and the other \\"Ender\\" books.

B000R7HY0K|1.0|I know it's supposed to be a homage to B-movies, but this was just terrible.  Aside from the characters Arlene (Vanessa Ferlito), Pam (Rose McGowan) and, of course, Stuntman Mike (the one and only Kurt Russell), I didn't care for any of the other characters.  Usually, the conversations in Tarantino's movies are entertaining, but in this movie it was just awful.  It's one thing for conversation to go on when it's engaging and amusing.  But in this case,  I couldn't wait for them to shut the hell up.  I have thought that if most of the actresses had been different, then it MIGHT have been more entertaining (a big \\"MIGHT\\").  It almost seemed like most of the actresses were trying too hard to sound \\"cool\\" because they were in a Tarantino flick.  I found myself fast forwarding through most of this babble to save myself from literally falling asleep.  And the character Kim?  The worst of them all.  I REALLY couldn't stand listening to her talk WHATSOEVER.  Just irritatingly sassy, if you dig what I'm saying.     As mentioned earlier, the only bright spots were Vanessa Ferlito, Kurt Russell, and Rose McGowan.  I was really hoping for more out of Vanessa's character, Arlene.  She was the only one of the \\"girls\\" that was really interesting to watch and had any redeeming qualities (NO, I am not favoring her because of her dance scene).  As for Kurt Russell?  By the time all of the asinine dialogue is through, I'm pulling for him.      All in all, this movie was a HUGE disappointment.
0805082662|4.0|I love his book and the original tape that goes with it of Bill Martin reading the book and the book being sang.  Gwneyth Partrow should stay with acting or bed time stories.  My students reacted better to my off key singing than to her sleept voice.
0887307280|4.0|If you can get past the wordiness and personal storyline in this book, there are two important messages. 1) There's much more to having a successful business than having a great idea or a talent. 2) A successful business is one that can operate without its owners. The book strives to provide guidelines on how to accomplish the latter. But there are other business sources that are more concrete - like Brad Sugars' series. And this book missed a major business component: money. It fails to address how to afford the labor that frees the owners - ex. through seed money or profit converted to a cash reserve. It also fails to address cash flow (not sales or profits) which poses difficulty for many small businesses    I'd recommend this book as one of many books to read if considering a business venture.
0143038419|1.0|Oh, Dear!  The New York Times Book Review says, \\"If a more likable writer than Gilbert is currently in print, I haven't found him or her...\\"  There must be something wrong with me, then.              There is much I admire, certainly: her humor, energy, and fearlessness.  She's a wonderful writer.  But I'm afraid she's also spoiled and shallow.  Why the personal attack?  Because she laid out her personal life for profit, so sure she was that we would love her: \\"There, don't you find me as fascinating as I do?\\", and her purported wisdom was hyped to such a degree that book clubs all over the country were duped into selecting it.  Yes I'm irritated.              Because I assumed Gilbert was a grownup, or I'd never have read this thing.       Poor Richard, the husband she dumps because she \\"didn't want to be married anymore.\\" She loftily says she will not expose his \\"issues,\\" but subtly emasculates him in print anyway.  She is a cliché, only the genders are reversed.  More often we hear it's the man who grows restive; finds an attractive package who \\"understands\\" him (in Gilbert's case it was a handsome actor and skilled womanizer named David); dumps spouse but not before the safety net of the new relationship is in place (Gilbert mentions somewhere that she never went five minutes since puberty without a boyfriend); is incredulous that the rejected spouse makes it difficult for him to leave.   One thing I will say for her.  She didn't have a baby.          But David, as Richard before him, is wrung out by her neediness.  I thought he sounded relieved when it was over.  In Italy, the dreamy Giovanni, ten years younger, is improbably wise and nurturing.  He seems older than she, she explains, and right out of the gate, on the first page, she is wishing he would kiss her.  Good Lord, this is embarrassing.  Meanwhile her conversations with God are flip and self-regarding, she seems to notice nothing of the poverty and suffering she must have been exposed to, never fora moment steps outside herself and knows, really empathizes with anybody--for all her new friends, she sees them as supporting actors in a play starring herself.  Predictably, she is in the middle of a heavy affair before the end of the book.  That she marries and hauls this guy back to New Jersey of all places is just funny.      The first year after it was published, hardly anybody had anything bad to say about this book.  I think that's because people who sensed it was not their sort of book didn't read it.  Then Oprah-fication in the fall of 2007 resulted in a great many people's reading it for book club, because they were persuaded by friends, etc.  Or the hype finally got to them and they thought, Maybe it's good and I should read it.  I feel like a bear who was poked awake in February with a leg of lamb and got a cold bean burrito instead.  It's some comfort that I'm not the only one.  Lately as many people hated this book as liked it.         If all you expect is a breezy good read, then Eat Pray Love won't disappoint.  If you expect wisdom, then spare yourself the aggravation!
B000VR824S|5.0|I enjoyed it so much!  I bought 2 copies besides my own; one for my son and another for a good friend. My friend manges a couple of bands and he told me when they were on the tour bus before and after the DVD was always on.    My son loved it to...the best of the best. I talked it up quite a bit so he didn't know how it could meet up to his expectations but after watching it he said it was even better than I said.
1558908420|5.0|Mr Stallone is fantastically successful and, I'm sure, needs no praise from me. But for me, this is his best work. The all-star support cast are good and easily dislikeable, and Liotta is on form, but although the film is not perfect, that is precisely what makes it so good.  Stallone's regretful, never-quite-good-enough Sheriff is the best character of all. Well worth a look. I wish he'd made more films like this. Take it for what it is and you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Yours,<br /><br />Baby Cromwell, Nottingham, England
B000ZLFALI|4.0|The plot for this movie may be razor thin, but it's definately worth seeing for the music and art direction alone. Not to mention it features a scene in which Joe Cocker sings \\"Come Together\\" while dressed as a pimp.

B00011RPB0|4.0|I just saw \\"Lost in Translation\\" for the first time today and I was impressed.  However, in view of the many super-negative reviews, I should clearly state that the movie came together in the final minute or two.  Had I not watched it to the end, I would not have has as positive reaction.  Indeed, the bulk of this movie is sheer boredom.  The writer and director want us to experience being in a lonely place (and boy do they suceed!).      Haven't you ever spent a week one day, or a month one week, or a day one hour in a place where you just didn't fit in?  Whether it be at the height of your career or as a child in a room full of adults, there is a real sense of loneliness when you realize that you are truly and profoundly all alone in a crowd; no one to relate to, nothing to entertain you, nothing to distract you, and you don't have the power to get up and leave; you're stuck!  I know that I can think of a number of times that has happened to me and there is a lonliness and sadness unique to such an experience.  Now think of similar settings on whose several occassions, there WAS someone who, for that otherwise interminable moment in time, was someone who made the experience turn into an manageable one.  It wasn't any \\"love at first sight\\" experience, it wasn't a \\"let's exchange phone numbers\\" (or even just Christmas cards) experience, and certainly not a \\"let's do this again\\" experience.  It was a place you never should have been but with someone who made the experience bearable.  That's what I saw in \\"Lost in Translation\\".  Moments like that come and then they are gone.  \\"Lost in Translation\\" is a tribute to all the misplaced persons who found each other briefly and then moved on.  It is a beautiful movie with exactly the right ending.  Share the boredom but share the blessing as well.
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|My husband and I are bid fans of NCIS and series 4 was all we have come to expect and more.... I highly recomend this series, we live in Australia and this series is not yet available here
0810994739|5.0|Excellent book! My 8 year old son has read it 3 times and has passed it along in his third grade class. I have recommended the book to several parents and they went out to get it. We have the first and second book and can not wait for the third. The two classmates he recommended the book to loved it.
B000UJ48O0|5.0|I was tempted to buy the DVD season sets individually to save money. Thank God I decided to get this instead! Here's the breakdown:    PROS:    1) The actual book's packaging is simply amazing to look at. The front cover of the book is a special lenticular material that mimics the shimmering moving water from the DVD menu as you view it from different angles.   2) The glossy photos interspersed throughout the interviews/commentary and episode summaries are very high quality and stylish, many I've never seen before. It's easy to navigate the episode guides and the excerpts of the Atomic County comic are fun to read.   3) The outside is a hard protective plastic shell that protects the inner book from dust and stuff, and you won't ever have to worry about it being damaged if you have to move or something.  4) Season 1 is completely remastered in widescreen. 'Nuff said.  5) Lots of extras and commentary on the extras DVDs.  6) I personally haven't had any problems with DVD's skipping or being scratched.    CONS:    1) I've never been a fan of cardboard DVD sleeves. Sure they're alright I guess, but I'm always paranoid I'm going to scratch the DVDs when taking them in and out, and sometimes the discs fall out if you're too rough.   2) This is a minor nitpick, but if you're a TRUE fan of the OC, you'll notice that the awesome animated shorts of Atomic County are not included on here. You'll have to buy the Atomic County collection on iTunes for a mere 2 bucks :)    Overall I am very, very satisfied with the set, this series really got the complete boxset treatment it deserved!
0810993139|5.0|My son first found the book in his school library and read it cover to cover in a couple of hours. He never put the book down. He asked for the second book and I purchased both books for him. He read this book all over again and then read book two. Excellent books! My son is 8.

B000BB1MI2|1.0|Saw the premiere. Waste of time. Burton will prob do much better with corpse bride. It is along the lines of a nightmare before Christmas. but about Charlie. Depp was typical Depp. Burton was typical Burton. The story, however, was told better the first time WITH music. don't give me the story how this is not a remake, but a more accurate to the book telling. Who cares?? There are much worse movies that vary from the book that should have been re-made long before this one. At many points I found myself waiting for one of the famous lines or songs only to see this film try hard not to be the first film. I hope the dahl family enjoys their more accurate junk. I feel bad for all the families that will get sucked into seeing this garbage with the whole family. At todays rates....ouch!! Just buy a copy of the old movie, microwave some popcorn, and sing along with the family instead. Sleepy Hollow and Scissorhands it ain't.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Pixar has made terrific movies over the last decade, this one is one of their best ever!   The story of a small mouse with the desire to cook and just be different from his peers is moving. The photography is superb as well as the sound. It offers the option to see it in Spanish, French and English. The plot is very easy to follow for small children and very entertaining! We have enjoyed this movie very much.
1933784032|5.0|Well.  This Star Wars book is go good, you can taste it.  The book takes you behind...really behind the scenes of every single thing that was ever conceived in the model shop of all the Star Wars films.  The details are very meticulous, including a two page spread on the new Vader's mask in Episode III.  I have read this book cover to cover already, but it is extremely easy on the eyes to go back several times to browse.  Buy it.  It is worth the listed price.
B000UR9T8C|4.0|I bought this product for my 5 year old son who is a enthusiastic fan of Spider Man. He loves spidey since he was 2.  Well, this is a very well made movie with incredible special effects, awesome sound and sound editing and a great photography.  Spider Man 3 is argueably the best action hero movie in many many years and surely the best third part of any action hero movie ever!<br />The plot portrayes a Peter Parker caught up in the emotions of having a tremendous success as a loved and well recognized Spider Man and, on the other hand, having a not so good real life as a struggling photographer at the Daily Bugle and a difficult relationship with the love of his life Mary Jane Watson.<br />The friendship of Peter and Harry Osborne goes thru different stages of partnership and bitter rivalry. New personages shares the scenes with Spidey, like the so expected Venom and the well handled Sand Man. Although Venom has a very short appearance, it is filled with excitement fighting Spider Man at the end. The Sand Man is protrayed as an ordinary man trapped in the terrible situation of getting money for his illed daughter and doing things he regrets deep in his heart. He became a monster as a action figure and as man by doing the wrong things time after time.<br />Overall, this is a 140 minutes master piece achieved by Director Sam Reimi and his crew.  A movie for the whole family to enjoy!
0345494768|5.0|Well.  As of 34 year old kid who simply loves Star Wars, and as a collector of all the \\"art of\\" and \\"making of\\" Star Wars books, this is the cherry on top of the sundae, even though I would not touch a cherry with a ten foot pole.  This book is for any huge fan of Star Wars who has wanted to sit down with George Lucas and ask him:  \\"How did you do this?\\"  and \\"Why did you do that?\\" or \\"How was this done?\\" and whatever else you might want to know.  There is a lot of information in the book about the exchanges between the studios and Lucas.  Not pleasant how it all went done, but the details include how obviously George was the victor.  The illustrations are many, familiar, and all beautiful.  To put it plain:  If you are going to own one Star Wars book,...this is it my fellow fans,...this...is...it!!!!
B000WCBPOG|5.0|Always a pleasure to listen to!  I enjoy that many songs have diminished instrumental accompaniment -- they focus on the beautiful voices and words.    I had considered ripping the audio from the DVD, but the soundtrack _is_ worthwhile because it removes background noises and talking (which I found annoying and distracting).    It is missing a couple songs, the one I missed was \\"I want you (she's so heavy)\\".  My desire for this song is evident, I ripped it from the DVD (which I also own).  It didn't have distracting noises/talking...
B000WCBPOG|3.0|Interesting versions. I guess the music without the film scnes loosses some of it's emotion.
B0006SSOHC|3.0|I've managed to miss this one over the last four years. Doesn't deserve four stars in my view. For a film that was obviously made on a reletively low budget it mostly works well though.<br /><br />The story reminded me of the sort of thing Clive Barker might have written in his Books of Blood (a series of short stories). OK there are a few inconsistencies in the plot but I thought it was pretty well acted and the twist at the end is well done. There are some genuinely creepy, not to mention grisly, moments scattered throughout the film.<br /><br />However do not be mislead by the hype and the advertising blurb. This isn't a touch on 'Seven', which is better written, acted and in a totally different class. I have watched 'Seven' many many times, but having just finished watching 'Saw' I really have no desire to see it again.
0783225482|5.0|This is so funny. Enjoyed so much. If you like to laugh then sit back and enjoy
B00079FUI6|1.0|How can anyone compare it with \\"Sex and the City\\" is beyond me. \\"Sex and the City\\" is art and there is beauty in it (especially in the relationship of four friends). \\"Desperate Housewives\\" is a desperate attempt to bring something funny and engaging, but it is not, so please stop trying. The only reason I even decided to watch it was Jesse Metcalfe (not that he is a great actor or anything, but he is nice to look at), but even he couldn't make me sit through the second set of discs of Season 1. The acting is stiff so are the characters, the writing is poor and the whole thing is ridiculous.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I have read the entire series of Dexter novels and was pleasantly surprised to find out that Showtime has dramatized the series. Ye potential readers and viewers, be aware!! The Showtime series differs from the books in several ways. The ending of the first book and the first series are not the same. The TV version fleshes out the other characters, such as Rita. the girlfriend and the police lieutenant, La Guerta  and introduces a new character in the person of Esme. The book is an intense ride within Dexter's mind with a focus on his relationship with his Dark Passenger. The details of his relationships with other humans are not as detailed as in the series.  Having said this, I highly recommend both. It will be interesting to see how Showtime adapts the second novel.  I think Showtime has done a great job of casting in this series. I remember Michael Hall from \\"Six Feet Under\\" and I think he makes a perfect Dexter.  Also, CBS is now showing Showtime's Dexter on Sunday evenings at 10 pm. It cuts too much from the Showtime series for my taste, but it is better than most of the junk on TV.
B000Y7U98C|5.0|This movie was given as a gift to a person who loves Sci-Fi Flicks and have mentioned just how good this movie is.  They have seen the movie more than 6 times in almost 1 month.....I think they like it.

B000WCBPOG|5.0|it got here pretty fast, i was surprised and the price for being a double album was really cheap. i would definetely recommend this item to people who liked the movie and the beatles music.
0452289963|2.0|A fundamental Buddhist teaching of mindfulness, or awareness, is the main subject of the book. I find it of interest to read how different people express the experience of awareness. Eckhart's writing is filled with passion (sometimes too much so) and length. Most of the book is devoted to describing what ails us, ego of course, with awareness being the antidote.     He does take tangents into the world of new age spirituality and grandiosity (we are in the dawn of a world wide awakening which is news to me) as well as scientific or historical topics which he is misinformed about. This  can distract from what he does well, descriptions of ego and descriptions of awareness from a very personal perspective.     Perhaps his book will lead people to dig deeper into the subject of Buddhism and awareness. For more reading on the same basic topic, which includes instructions on HOW to practice and develop awareness, (something that is lacking in Eckhart's book) pick up; \\"Mindfulness in Plain English\\" by Gunaratana.
B000JLSLZQ|5.0|Just fantastic!  I think that this is really a good film.  Everything is well done:  music of course, photography, casting, acting, dancing, special effects, etc.  Any film student could learn a lot watching several times this film and learning from it.  And if you are not an student you will enjoy it a lot.  I promise.
B000Y179KO|5.0|It's been nearly three decades since The Eagles released a studio album of brand new material, and the loooooooong wait was definitley worth it. The  band have toured over the years and had the ocassional new song here and there, but nothing compares to an entire new CD. And what a new CD it is!. Upon first listen, it's as if the years in between never happened. The guys have picked up where they left off and continue making music together as if they never stopped. The familiarity of the sound and tone is refreshing. They aren't trying to be what's \\"new\\" or trying to connect with what the youngsters would like. They just make music. Straight forward, unapologetic, and simple. Just good music.    The CD is a sprawling 2 discs that runs for nearly an hour and a half. Out of these two disc, disc 1 is easily the best. Disc 2 is great, but the first one is definitley 'The Eagles'. \\"How Long\\", a JD Souther song, is a classic tune for the band. It has a very easy going, charming vibe to it like \\"Take It Easy\\". \\"What Do I Do With My Heart\\" is a beautiful ballad sung by Glen Frey, with a little assistance at the end by Henley. Lovely song. \\"Waiting In The Weeds\\", sung by Henley, has a late 80's/early 90's sound to it that wouldn't be out of place during his \\"End Of The Innocence\\" period. Joe Walsh gets in on the action with the rocking \\"Guilty Of The Crime\\", a up tempo tune that harkens back to their late 70's/early 80's rock. Timothy B. Schmidt knocks it out of the park with two songs, \\"I Don't Want To Hear Anymore\\" and \\"Do Something\\". Each one, especially the latter, match his previous singles with the band. Henley gets a little old school rocking done on \\"Fast Company\\", and Frey ends the first disc with the short, but pretty, \\"You Are Not Alone\\". My favorite track, however, would be the Henley sung \\"Busy Being Fabulous\\". An absolutely great and charming ditty that is currently the second single.    Disc 2 is where things get a bit more rock and roll, and sound much more like their edgier sound once Joe Walsh had joined the band. The epic 10 minute \\"Long Road Out Of Eden\\" starts things off in classic Eagles tradition. This is a song that could of come out of any of their earlier albums. \\"Somebody\\" is a great little rocker from Glen Frey that sounds as if it would belong with his mid 80's solo stuff. Walsh contributes the cool \\"Last Good Time In Town\\", while Henley delivers three knock-out songs. \\"Frail Grasp Of The Big Picture\\" and \\"Business As Business\\", are vintage Henley tracks that also wouldn't be out of place from his own solo career. \\"Center Of The Universe\\" is a beautiful little song that features those great Eagles harmonies. The disc ends with Frey singing \\"It's Your World Now\\". The lyrics are meaningful. Is this it?. Is this the end of the road for the band?. Let's hope not.    \\"Long Road Out Of Eden\\" is a superb CD filled with wonderful music. There are a lot of great artists and bands who deliver wonderful harmonies, but there is just something special about these 4 guys. Nobody sounds like them, and this CD sounds as if time has stood still. There is so much good stuff here. They are already on their second single, but there are at least another 3-5 tracks here that belong on the radio. It's just good music. Henley and Frey are usually the most with the vocals, but Walsh and Schmidt's contributions are wonderful. They all do their part. It should satisfy fans and, hopefully, gain new ones. I can't stop listening to it.
B000MRAAJW|4.0|Most of the photography is GREAT! However, too many shots seem to be less than High Definition. I would have preferred a higher-quality sound as well. Overall, I'd still recommend this DVD.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|I've enjoyed Radiohead for a long time, and have been quite eager to hear some good music from them again. I was rather disappointed in their previous three (Kid A, Amnesiac, and Hail to the Thief). While these albums had good individual tracks, they were not the complete albums that Radiohead produced in The Bends and OK Computer (OKC is, IMHO, one of the best albums of all time...) I didn't like the initial track at first, but the album quickly improves. Thanks for a wonderful album, and for renewing my faith in your band!
B000002J1I|5.0|Yes' 1978 underrated masterpiece 'Tormato' is a lot better than people say it is. In fact, I personally think it's one of Yes' best records. I've always loved it. There isn't a single song on this disc I don't like.    Who doesn't like 'Don't Kill The Whale'? It's rare not to see it on compilations. It recieved the most commercial success out of all of the songs.    I think 'On The Silent Wings Of Freedom' is a mighty fine jam session. Rick Wakeman plays some fine keyboard, and this has to be among Chris Squire's bass songs.     Another great song where Squire shines is 'Arriving UFO.' This strange, but wonderful piece of music is one of my favorites on the record. 'Future Times/Rejoice' is a classic, and I believe it should have gotten radio airplay.    Overall, Yes fans should give 'Tormato' a chance. I love it. But, this is the last record to feature the classic five Yes lineup until many years later. Jon Anderson would depart to focus on his solo career, and so would Wakeman. They were replaced by Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes of The Buggles (of 'Video Killed The Radio Star' fame).    Overall, this is a great record. Highly recommended for any Yes fan. ENJOY!!!

B000002GBJ|5.0|I am longtime Strawbs and Yes listener, so I know Rick Wakeman's music very well. I am a proud owner of the album. It's one of the best records ever. And, with musicians like Bill Bruford, Chris Squire, Barry De Souza, Dave Cousins and Alan White lending a hand, you know it's going to be great.    The record was released in 1972 on A&M records, and features six songs based on all six of Henry VIII's wives. As Wakeman describes it, he tries to put the women's stories into music, which is a brilliant concept to me.    And, it paid off. 'Anne Of Cleves,' 'Anne Boleyn,' and 'Catherine Howard' are also masterpieces. Consider this rock and roll with a touch of classical.     Rick's unique keyboard style really shows on this record. I prefer this over 'King Arthur' and 'White Rock,' believe it or not. This record has a charm that no other Wakeman record could quite capture. But all of Wakeman's records are great!!!    Overall, this is highly recommended for any prog rock, Yes, Strawbs or Rick Wakeman fan. This is a very entertaining record that I love.    ENJOY!!!

B00005ASIL|3.0|Jethro Tull. They are a legendary progressive group whose music has made an impact on many generations. Led by Ian Anderson, the legendary flute player and singer and Martin Barre, Tull has made some of the finest music ever put out.    'The Very Best of Jethro Tull,' unfortunately doesn't document it. There are so many songs missing. And, 'Thick As A Brick' and 'Heavy Horses' are both edited. 'Thick As A Brick' is chopped down from 40+ minutes to just 3:03, and 'Heavy Horses' from 8+ to 3:20.     And, if you're going to issue 'The Very Best of Jethro Tull' AT LEAST MAKE IT TWO DISCS!!! Where is 'Teacher,' 'Crossfire,' 'A Song For Jeffrey,' 'Warchild' and 'Dharma For One'? These are key tracks to Jethro Tull's legacy, and yet, they are all not on here!     This disc does fill 78 of the 80 minutes that can be held on a disc, so it's not skimpy, but it could be a lot better. If you want a Jethro Tull collection of songs in their full-length versions, check out 'Classic Masters' or 'Through The Years.' It doesn't matter, considering they are identical.    The bottom line is Chrysalis could have done A LOT better.
1878424777|5.0|This book has helped my relationships and my general outlook on life. It has given me peace. What more can you ask? I really love the audio versions.
B000002J23|5.0|1980's 'Drama' was unusual. Not only did famed keyboard player Rick Wakeman depart, but legendary vocalist Jon Anderson also departed as well. They were replaced by Geoff Downes and Trevor Horn, aka The Buggles later in 1979. The Buggles had achieved success in late '79 with 'Video Killed The Radio Star.'      This record has recieved mixed reviews over the years. Some love it, others hate it. I love it. It's got a unique sound that no other Yes record has. Sure, Horn is no Anderson, but he has his bright spots. The real highlights are 'Tempus Fugit' and 'Machine Messiah.' Those are two of Horn's best songs.    Overall, if you can't bare to listen to Yes without Jon Anderson, don't buy it. But if you truly love Yes like I do, than chances are you'll enjoy this record. And, Steve Howe, Chris Squire and Alan White are still here, so it's not THAT bad!    Highly recommended for the experimental Yes fan. ENJOY!!!
B000TLMWMY|5.0|I was on my way home from Nam when the JC show premiered. And I had alot of catching-up to, so I didn't watch too much tv. But Thank God for recordings. The Best of the Johnny Cash TV Show 1969-1971 is awesome! GET IT! You won't be disappointed. There's a little bit for everyone, and a whole lot for some! For me, it's all good. Especially, Tony Joe White. But that's the way Johnny Cash wanted it. Screw the producers...

B000FVNX2Q|5.0|I've been using an HP-12 since it first came out. (Before that I used an HP-8.) It does everything an old financial guy needs; mortgage calculations, discounted cash flows, etc. I was pleased to find that this calculator also has added algebraic functions. Nothing scarey and very helpful. Also, the HP is 'bulletproof' and its batteries last a very long time.
B000ZN8036|2.0|There is little to fault in an individual's search for an alternative way of being, especially in the context of the consumer culture we currently inhabit. And there is even less wrong with the desire to articulate and express the realities of such a search, especially when derived from genuine experience and events. But Mr. Penn's film actually addresses none of this.<br /><br />First, consider the issue of form: Is this story better told as a documentary or as drama?  My vote would be documentary, a vote that surely truncates the potential audience and, from a purely subjective perspective, severely curtails the rampant scale for creative self-indulgence on display in every aspect of this movie. And second, consider that the choice to use drama here ends up borrowing so heavily from the visual language of soft drink advertising: vast nature as witness to the thrown back head and widespread arms of momentary human exultation derived from what? Carbonation? Freedom? Who can tell? And after a more than two hour torrent of such clich&eacute;s, who could care? And still, that image and gesture -- amid some of the dumbest directing and gratuitous stylistic gestures I've seen in a long time -- are as close as the movie comes to providing any acknowledgment of life elsewhere, let alone any understanding of the promise of \\"escape\\" and its unsurprising shortfall.<br /><br />Since the details of the actual events are so scant anyone taking up this story will be reasonably expected to acknowledge its fundamental unknowability, or to (responsibly and consistently) fill in the fine points. When, near the end, the narrator tells us that the story can now only be told by its principal character Penn instead goes on to give us the whole cloth of a sunshiny family reunion-at-death, completing the movie's collapse into unadulterated kitsch. Penn clearly wants it both ways, through the experience of the man who lived it and through Sean's own fantasy interpretation. If nothing else, this is hugely sloppy and indulgent work. By trying to extract a happy end from an as-it-should-be unhappy ending, the audience is left not happy/sad but stupefied by club-fisted sentimentality and bleeding profusely of a million paper cuts from the purely Hallmarkian screenplay, left as the credits pass only able to acknowledge that the original meaning of \\"bewildered\\" -- to be lost in the wilderness -- remains the best and only meaning available.y and indulgent work.

0385338724|5.0|Another HYSTERICAL book by my favorite author. I'm always interested to see how Kinsella handles the stand alone books, as the Shopaholic books hold a special place in my heart and are difficult to top, but Remember Me? certainly delivers! At first I must admit the beginning was a little slow to get into, but after the third chapter I was hooked, and beginning to laugh out loud as usual. Remember Me? has the perfect mixture of sentiment, humor, and \\"Oh my god! I can't believe she just said/did that\\" moments that make Kinsella's books so enjoyable to read. As the world's slowest reader it say something that I finished all 389 pages in four hours! This gem is a page turner, and Lexi, the new heroine, is a character that I closely identified with, as i know others will. If at least the toilet scene doesn't have you falling off your chair laughing, well then, you must not have a pulse!
B000RIHBIE|5.0|I usually never bother to write a review but after listening to this CD for close to 100 times I felt compelled to expose its greatness! The above review said a lot and what i would add is this CD is as great as Green Days \\"American Idiot\\"! Its a shame that the Band decided to release the first 2 tracks which is what many will judge the entire CD on. They are good typical Sum 41 songs but not represntative of the diversity and depth of the cd as it progresses. \\"March of the Dogs\\", \\"Pull the Curtain\\", and culminating in \\"Confusion and Frustration in Modern Times\\" are more representative. If you are reading this you probably are a fan of the genre and maybe Sum 41. Get this CD you won't be disappointed. P.S. I am an averaage fan and not associated with amazon or Sum 41 in any way!!

B000MRAAJM|5.0|Hollywood could never rival a star so tremendous as our Planet Earth. This Blu-Ray disc series is simply amazing. Everything from shots of gigantic bird migrations to the smallest splashes of water from a stream is so, for lack of better expression, \\"Hi-Def.\\"     This feels like the closest you will ever be to the real thing, sometimes I feel like these shots are more detailed than what my eye would see in real life. If you want to amaze your friends or ever need to convince the wife that the two and a half grand you put down for that 1080 LCDHD and Blu-Ray player was worth it, this is the series to prove it!
B000HC2LI0|2.0|Many, many dvd's in this collection are scratched. This was brand new, wrapped in plastic - so that's hard to explain other than poor production quality. Sadly, I'm finding this out as I go along on the series....very disappointing for the price.
B0012Q94QW|2.0|In a nutshell: This movie was long and boring. There were many wasted scenes with pointless activities during the movie, where I had to wonder what the hell was going on. I kept seeing this old woman who kept almost dying (eventually she did), and a bunch of people in some barbaric activities. To me this movie was a dissapointment, and was almost impossible to follow. I have to admit, the fight scenes are awesome, but they are few and far in between in this movie, and you have to sit and wait for them to come. I mean the movie was about 1 hour and 45 minutes, but if those waisted scenes were trimmed, it would have been cut down to an hour. Thats how long and boring this movie was. Either way, I cannot recommend this movie, or atleast wait for it to come on DVD so you can rent it. Peace.
0452289963|5.0|I chose to read A New Earth because of a feeling of lack as far as life, as I thought it was, was concerned.

I'm able to breathe every moment in appreciation for a still, calming Presence that rules. It's magnificent!
B0010ZR160|5.0|This is a fine film, worthy of the book that preceded it.  (If you don't know the Kenzie/Gennaro books that Dennis Lehane penned before he focused exclusively on standalones, discover them now.  They're terrific.)  Affleck's direction is excellent.  The high points: the Dorchester feel, the use of local, non-professional, actors (and, hence, brilliant casting); the pitch-perfect accents; and last but certainly not least--Casey Affleck's award-level performance.<br /><br />The plot exudes and sustains a great deal of tension, but it is in no way claustrophobic.  The ending comes in stages.  This gives the plot a different type of rhythm, as the layers are removed.  Only one slight cavil--Bubba is the most memorable character in the Kenzie/Gennaro books--an invincible earth scorcher who, fortunately, likes Patrick and Angie.  He plays Hawk to their Spenser or Joe Pike to their Elvis Cole.  We should know more about him in the film, so we can place him in proper context.  The actor who plays him should also be much larger in physical stature, much kinder/gentler with regard to Patrick and Angie and far more menacing with regard to the bad guys.  This was a missed opportunity.<br /><br />Let's hope this becomes a franchise.

B000E97X66|5.0|This is my favorite rock and roll album of all time.  An electrifying, hungry, and unforgettable Bruce Springsteen performance as he and the E Street Band are on the brink of greatness in their first overseas gig: London in November 1975.  The energy of the crowd, the time and place in history, the band, and the Boss rushes out of the CD and, as your heart begins to race, you feel as if you are truly there.  I have never felt so alive listening to an album.      To Sony: please release more Springsteen concerts from the archives.  His place in music history demands it.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|Will ferrell, Queen Latifah, Dustin Hoffman, Emma Thompson, and Maggie Gyllenhaal at their best.    From the opening, the picture runs with smooth transitions, cunning camera angles, and clever mathematical overlays. Emma Thompson narrates in a beautiful and intelligent british accent. The plot behind the movie is revealed quite quickly, but it takes some patience to get to the climax and resolution. The movie drags quite a bit, but overall I believe it is worth the wait.    Stranger than Fiction is a clever, comical, yet deep heartwarmer that is a \\"must see\\".

B000002MIF|5.0|This is my favorite Smiths album, hands down. Great songs, just the right amount of mope and wit. The only blemish is the presence of \\"How Soon is Now,\\" but only because it was the closest the band came to a top 40 hit in America and got WAY overplayed. Although I'm sure the song's success helped keep the band clothed and fed, it also diminished their specialness somehow. The rest of the album is sublime.
B000YENUI6|5.0|Eastern Promises is one of those multilayered films that you should be REALLY cautious about reading reviews about. You don't want to learn key parts of the plot before you go into the movie, because it is fascinating to watch them unfold. This is a completely spoiler free review for that reason.<br /><br />Eastern Promises is about the Russian Mob scene in London, England. Viggo Mortensen is Nikolai, a Siberian-born low level mob member - a 'driver only' as he constantly makes clear. He is the support of the boss' son, Kirill (Vincent Cassel, recently famous for being the French Thief in the Ocean's 11 series). Kirill is a bit of a wastrel and needs all the help he can get. Into this world comes Naomi Watts as Anna, a midwife at a local hospital. She delivers a baby for a 13 year old Russian girl who then dies on the table. Anna finds the girl's diary and wants to track down the baby's family. Unfortunately for her, the diary is in Russian.<br /><br />Of course it becomes clear pretty quickly that the girl in question was a prostitute to the Russian mob, an unwilling prisoner. Anna's quest to get the diary's information runs up against the mob who would much rather the whole issue go away quietly. Anna can't let it go, and Nikolai gets caught in the middle as the enforcer who needs to follow the rules.<br /><br />Both Nikolai and Anna have to \\"hide their emotions\\" and only let out glimpses of how they feel. Nikolai as a mobster must always be as close-to-the-vest as possible. Anna, a midwife who has just had a miscarriage herself and had her boyfriend leave her, is also keeping her emotions under wraps. To see the glimpses shine out through their eyes is very powerful.<br /><br />To give away any more would do a great disservice to this fantastic film, so let me talk in generalities. The actors are *superb*. I grew up in a Ukrainian household and Viggo's serious research into his part has really paid off. He actually went to Siberia to hang out with \\"tough guys\\" and picked up many of the mannerisms and speech patterns of that area. He also did a great deal of research into the tattoo culture of the mob and his research was then used in the movie.<br /><br />Interestingly, Viggo says in the director's commentary that he once went out for lunch with the tattoos still on, and realized that a Russian couple was staring at the marks with fear. It both made him happy that his research was well done and also very guilty that he had inadvertently upset them. He made sure never to wear the tattoos out in public again after that.<br /><br />Much has been made about a multi-minute completely nude fight scene he has in a steam bath. It is amazing in this day and age that women are routinely asked to go completely naked (and the prostitites sometimes are in this film) but if a *guy* is nude it's shocking. Maybe this says something about the level of equality in the world. Interestingly, Viggo said right out that he had no problem doing this scene and I think it really shows just how vulnerable his character was, to have nothing but his own wits to save his life.<br /><br />If other actors had handled these parts I imagine it would have been all in English which really would have cut down on the immersion factor. Instead, because of Viggo's language talents and the talents of the other actors, fair parts of the film are in Russian, which really gives you a great sense for the richness of the language's sound.<br /><br />Highly, highly recommended. This is one of those DVDs that is great to own, because every time you watch it you see one more layer in the way the characters react to dialogue, glance at each other and emit a wealth of emotion in the subtlest of looks.d picked up many of the mannerisms and speech patterns of that area.

B000EXDS5M|1.0|Despite by being over 50 years old, I had never seen this movie before so I was actually looking forward to finally experiencing it.  Talk about style over substance...  I kept on saying to myself \\"what's the point...?\\"  What was the point of the bicycle scene (except to promote B.J. Thomas's \\"Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head\\"?)  What was the point of that ridiculous New York montage sequence?  This film was too cute, too pretentious, and too vapid.  I guess I wasn't missing anything these past few decades.  I can see how it could appeal to adolescent sensibilities, though.
1400077915|5.0|The women in Munro's stories don't seem to fit in, and the narrative gives the reader a vantage point unlike any other. She shines a bright light on many self-limiting beliefs women cling to even today, as they did in the stories set decades in the past. She exposes taboos that are so ingrained they seem like \\"just the way things are\\" This is required reading for every woman and girl.    Munro's singular talent is in forcing the reader to challenge assumptions. You never see it coming, but every story has at least one of these moments where everything that came before has to be re-evaluated.     The story-worlds are described with an anthropologist's naivete. Her depictions of southern Ontarians (I am one) make me want to gasp and say \\"so I'm not the only one who notices that??\\" In everything she writes about, she picks up on things I have never seen anyone else articulate.    A truly enriching an captivating book. Had me reading into the wee hours of the morning.
B000VWYJ86|3.0|***1/2<br /><br />The third film in the \\"Bourne\\" series finds itself descending a little bit into redundancy. While the first film found Jason Bourne, amnesiac assassin, reclaiming his humanity while trying to find his identity and the second film found the character beginning to make amends while facing the consequences for his past, Jason Bourne seems to be on auto-pilot in \\"The Bourne Ultimatum.\\" The character's motives seem unclear ... although his goal is still to get to the source of his past and condition, he doesn't seem sure what he intends to do when he does. Is he looking for redemption or just revenge?<br /><br />As with the first two films, the action, acting and direction are all top-notch. It's just that the subplots don't ever really go anywhere. The supporting characters are all intriguing, but they're not really given much to do. Julia Stiles' character never gets to reveal her history with Bourne, and an interesting scene that finds her cutting and dying her hair, mirroring the scene with Marie from the first film, is never fully developed. The subplot of the corrupt CIA agents setting up Pam (Joan Allen's character) to take the fall for the entire Treadstone program is also introduced and then never really fleshed out. The film repeatedly chooses long chase scenes instead of character development.<br /><br />Also frustrating is how little about Bourne's past is actually revealed in the film. Although Bourne claims at one point \\"I remember everything\\", the viewer really gets to know very little of it. After three films, the audience deserves a bigger payback for their investment.
B000063JZQ|4.0|As an English teacher, this a great version to complement the reading of the play.  However, you must exercise caution as there is lots of blood and gore with this version.  There is also a nude scene that is generally unappropriate for school viewing (I cover the lens of my projector so that the students just hear the dialogue of Lady Macbeth).  If you are able to handle the extra, this a great addition.

B000063COX|5.0|Just because Iron Maiden were mostly succesfull with Bruce Dickinson as their signer and that the albums were huge hits and all,it doesn't neccesarily mean that the previous signer Paul Di'Anno didn't do great albums with Maiden.In 1979-1980 the New Wave Of Brittish Heavy Metal exploded and Maiden were amongst the best of them and one of the surviving ones.Actually the two albums he did with the band \\"Iron Maiden\\" and \\"Killers\\" in 1980 and 1981 respectively can be considered as very good albums and influential ones as well,this first album especially.This album is actually a \\"chef d'oeuvre\\"(yeah a big word or two never hurts anybody)of the heavy metal genre.Well actually this album is showing their Punk-Rock roots and Di'Anno did have a pretty good voice for the genre of music they played at the time and has a special voice that I have grown to appreciate and its too bad that the band didn't make any other albums with him,even if i consider the Bruce era to be my favourite and the best.The songs on this one are classics of metal and are still great today,like the praised \\"Phantom Of The Opera\\" and the excellent \\"Prowler\\" that have a very classic sound and a good appeal with most Maiden fans.<br /><br />Iron Maiden have been around since 1975(Christmas day,heheh)and all I have to say is why?Why didn't they release an album sooner but anyway the songs on here are some of the ones they had been playing since the debut of their careers and became some of their early hits.\\"Prowler\\" was in fact on the band's 3 demo songs on their first LP,\\"Soundhouse Tapes\\" issued in 1978,and Iron Maiden caught attention from their beggenings as they sold five thousand copies in weeks.The lineup on this first album is the lineup of Steve Harris on bass,Paul Di'Anno as vocalist,Dennis Stratton as guitarist,Dave Murray on guitar and drummer Clive Burr.What's impressive is that the album reached # 4 in the UK charts in its first week of release!This album may not be considered as their best but this was a very influential album back then and it was the seed that would help generate many bands and most notably the \\"Trash-Metal\\" genre.<br /><br />The songs on this one are very Punk-Rock inspired as I said but with an element of metal in it that makes it a true Iron Maiden album.The songs are very good and my personnal favourite and it shouldn't be a surprise is the much praised \\"Phantom Of The Opera\\",its an amazing piece of metal with terrific guitar playing and great vocals by Di'Anno,this is the masterpiece od the Di'Anno era and its worth hearing as this is one of Maiden's best songs ever.\\"Prowler\\" is a song from earlier days and has a nice wah-wah guitar intro and a catchy chorus that will get stuck in your head.\\"Transylvania\\" is a solid instrumental song but not much more,its good tought.\\"Running Free\\" is one of the famous songs of the album and with good reasons,as this is a great song with solid lyrics and a great guitar riff and a solid song overral,one of the best on the album.\\"Remember tommorrow\\" is nearly an instrummental with less singing but it shows each musician's capacities and the guitar solos and the riffs are amazing!It has great harmonies going from a slow part to fast one and from fast to slow.Strange World is a ballad,yes a heavy band doing a ballad and there is nothing wrong with it if its as good as this,very good track.Charlotte The Harlotte And Iron Maiden are both very good songs and finish the album pretty well to say the least.And last,the unreleased song \\"Sanctuary\\"(I don't know if it really is an unreleased song)is excellent with a great rebelion feeling that can be felt while listening to it and its one of the best tracks on the album!<br /><br />This album is very good and is actually a solid album but its also must I say,the most underrated.Its full of classics and any fans should get this as every fans from every band in the world should get the opportunity to hear the debut and the basic idea of the band,if not just tocompare how good they've comed.If you don't like Maiden with Bruce you might like this more as it sounds like classic Punk Rock but a metal and more harmonic touch in it and with with very solid lyrics.\\"Iron Maiden\\" is a great album well deserving of a place in any metal fans's musical library.Its a great album but not a great one to start with,at least in my opinion if you are starting then as your first move get an album from the Bruce era as with those you are sure of liking them.If you are an older fan and have listened to most of the Bruce stuff then this is recommended(you'll know what Maiden sounded then).y've comed.If you don't like Maiden with Bruce you might like this more as it sounds like classic Punk Rock but a metal and more harmonic touch in it and with with very solid lyrics.\\"Iron Maiden\\" is a great album well deserving of a place in any metal fans's musical library.Its a great album but not a great one to start with,at least in my opinion if you are starting then as your first move get an album from the Bruce era as with those you are sure of liking them.If you are an older fan and have listened to most of the Bruce stuff then this is recommended(you'll know what Maiden sounded then).
B000MCH5P4|4.0|A Japanese hunter gives a riffle to a Moroccan tour guide in thanks of a pleasurable hunting trip.  That Moroccan man in turn sells the riffle to a family that lives nearby.  The man who purchases the gun tells his two young sons to use it to kill jackals that have been eating their animals.  The boys instead decide to shoot at a tourist bus, and thus begins this harrowing story that spans three continents and four families in pursuit of a greater truth; that we only want to hear what we want to hear and if we ever want to truly be understood we must be willing to listen.  `Babel' is an extremely well done film that, while never as a whole reaching levels of miraculous greatness, has moments of truly tender and emotional brilliance.<br /><br />I have been a fan of Inarritu ever since watching `Amores Perros' and so `Babel' was high on my list of films to see in 2006.  Surprisingly it took me a while to actually get to this film, but I finally did and I'm happy the time had come.  While it is probably my least favorite film but Inarritu (collectively) it actually has some of my favorite scenes he's ever directed (especially when involving the character of Chieko).  There are a few strands missing from this film in my opinion, a few loose ends that could have been tightened up; but overall this is a very rewarding experience.  This is one of those films I feel could have run a tad longer; maybe that would have deepened some of the sequences.<br /><br />The film centers around a stray bullet that hits an American tourist named Susan.  Susan and her husband Richard are vacationing in Morocco in an attempt to find some connection they lost between themselves.  Before they have a chance to manage anything more than a handhold Susan's life is put in danger.<br /><br />Back home in San Diego their children are being kept by their nanny Amelia.  Amelia is supposed to leave for her sons wedding in Mexico but due to the accident in Morocco she is left to care for the children longer than was expected.  Finding no one who can take the children she decides to take them with her to Mexico for the wedding.  All seems fine for a time but upon trying to reenter the country she is met with trouble.<br /><br />Back in Morocco the two boys responsible for the shooting are trying to keep their involvement a secret but when the gun is inadvertently traced back to their father they are forced to uncover the truth.  The families decision there after places them all at risk.<br /><br />The final storyline takes place in Tokyo where Chieko, a young deaf-mute Japanese girl, is coming into her own.  Feeling outcast by her peers, her disability becomes a hindrance to her emotional growth.  She feels jaded and left out as she watches her friends date and interact in ways she only wishes she could.  This in turn causes her to seek affections in the most obscene and inappropriate of manors, not ever really understanding the consequences.  This storyline is probably the most rewarding yet the most damaging to the film.  Instead of focusing on Chieko's father (the hunter responsible for placing the said riffle in dangerous hands) the film focuses on Chieko.  Chieko's story is the most fascinating and overall the most emotionally resonant of the entire film but it doesn't fit.  Each of the other three stories are all connected to one incident whereas Chieko's story feels like a complete deviation from the plot of the film.  It's not a terrible thing but in the end I feel like it takes a little away from the film.<br /><br />The performances within this film are all beautiful to witness.  Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett are touching and so brutally honest with their characters.  Watching the guard surrounding Richard slowly fall away until he is stripped bare of any protectors and thus becomes raw emotion is so tragically effective.  The scene where he breaks down on the hospital phone is memorable and gripping.  Adriana Barraza is marvelous as Amelia, especially as the film draws to a close.  Her final scene with immigration is heartbreaking and so gritty and real.  The standout here though is the marvelous Rinko Kikuchi who is utterly flawless as Chieko.  Her character is so well fleshed out to where you feel her inner struggle and become one with her pain.  The scene where she breaks down after her advances to the police officer are turned down is so painful yet so immaculate you can't help but embrace it to the full.  It is probably my single favorite scene in the entire cinematic year that was 2006.<br /><br />The point behind `Babel' is that we, as humans, don't take the time to truly listen.  What I found so wonderful about this film is that really, other than Richard and Susan's situation, language barriers really play no part in the lack of understanding.  True, with Chieko there are some who don't know sign language and thus must read her writing to communicate, but at least they have that.  No, in `Babel' the lack of understanding comes mostly from the selfishness that engulfs us.  Quite frankly we too often don't want to listen.  When the police are mercilessly shooting at the Moroccan family instead of allowing them to explain and or surrender, it's not language gaps that prevent them from rationally dealing with a problem, it's stubborn pride.  When Amelia and her nephew are stopped at the border it's not language gaps that prevent them from explaining their situation, its blatant assumption and carelessness.  When Chieko accuses her father of never listening to her you get the impression that no one ever truly has listened to her and that's what makes her breakdown so much more moving; it was a long time in the coming.<br /><br />`Babel' teaches us a powerful lesson about relationships with others and the responsibility we have as family, friends and in general human beings to take the time to truly listen to others.  If we weren't so preoccupied with our own interests then maybe this world would see fewer tragedies.th immigration is heartbreaking and so gritty and real.

B0006OBPTA|5.0|I am pleased with it.  Don't be alarmed that there are only 3 discs in the set, KKIII and Next KK are combined on one DVD.  This set took me back to the 80's, and to see it again, in DVD quality and in widescreen format, I think it's great.  I recommend for any Karate Kid fan.
B000ZN802W|4.0|One thing that can't be overstated about Sean Penn's `Into the Wild' is that it truly is a breathtaking cinematic experience.  The films vivid scenes are beautiful to watch and come alive in the viewer.  There are moments of such crisp realism that we feel we are right alongside McCandless in his journeys.  The Alaskan countryside is flawlessly depicted (although pictures never do anything justice...I've been there and I can honestly say it is the most beautiful place on mother earth...`Into the Wild' comes very close to capturing it though).  The action sequences are masterfully edited to where we feel one with them, like we are in that canoe or on that train or crossing that creek.<br /><br />Sadly though, what is visually breathtaking is no so much emotionally breathtaking.  By the close of the film we don't feel as though we really understand the man that is Christopher McCandless.  We come to know Alexander Supertramp but McCandless is a mystery.  Maybe this is because McCandless never truly found himself, but as the film draws to a close and we are supposed to feel the revelations this man is finally realizing I have to cry wolf.  As McCandless scribbles into his journal that he feels scarred and lonely I found myself scratching my head, because I never got that from him.  The film paints McCandless as one thing and one thing only; self absorbed.  He runs from human interaction and thrives on being one with nature.  That is all fine in itself but as the running time starts to give way to credits Penn tries desperately to prove McCandless has seen the folly in his ways and come to realize he needs human interaction to survive.  I guess maybe he attempts this too late in the film and only give the audience a good five minutes to embrace this concept.<br /><br />It doesn't quite work.<br /><br />The film follows the two-year journey of Christopher McCandless as he picks up after graduating college and sets off on an adventure of a lifetime.  He donates his entire saving to charity, burns whatever money he has left and hitches his way across the continent with nothing really but the clothes on his back and a few awkward supplies.  He sets his sights on Alaska, but he's not opposed to a few stops along the way.  From Colorado to Mexico and just about everywhere in between McCandless meets many people that supposedly shape the outcome of his outlook on life.  McCandless grew up in a house filled with yelling and fighting and threatened divorce.  Not that that doesn't take place in 75% of all homes in America but regardless, this is what he was up against.  Feeling as though he had no family he decided to leave everything behind and find himself.  What he found, or so we're told, was loneliness and fear; but of course that came after all the fun and excitement.<br /><br />Whatever must be said for the portrayal of McCandless it has nothing to do with the performance given by Emile Hirsch.  I am not usually moved or even impressed with this young man but this has to be his finest performance to date (the fact that he does all of his own stunts and loses Christian Bale amounts of weight here shows great dedication and also plays in his favor).  He seems to understand the selfishness that lives within his character and he exudes it in a very subtle way, one that could be justified by some as free-spirited but is without doubt selfish dependence.  The only place in which his performance falters is when he is asked to portray an ounce of regret as the film closes, but again I feel that is not his fault as much as it is the fault of the unfair time restraint placed on him by Penn.<br /><br />The entire cast rises to the challenge in this film, and while much of the film revolves around McCandless in his solidarity there is much to be said for actors who can do so much with so little.  Harden and Hurt may not be seen much if not within flashbacks, but they each have their own scenes of splendid bliss (the scene where Hurt collapses inthe street broke my heart).  Jena Malone is poorly underused (I just love her) but makes an impression as Christopher's sister Carine.  I've never seen her look so beautiful, that's for sure.  Vince Vaughn seems a little out of place for me here but he manages to deliver well, and Kristen Stewart is just delightful as Tracy.  I remember watching her in `In the Land of Women' and thinking that she had much to offer if it were only tapped a little better and here she proves that that tapping is well underway.  Catherine Keener develops a beautiful character in Jan and Brian Dierker works off of his co-stars wonderfully as Rainey.<br /><br />Above all else, Hirsch included, is the magnificent Hal Holbrook.  His beautiful and touching portrayal of Ron Franz, the old man who takes Chris under his wing, is the most memorable supporting character in the film.  What Ron does with his small screen time (roughly fifteen minutes, give or take) is really more than anyone else does here.  His final scene with Hirsch is so moving, so touching and ultimately so heartbreaking.  I'm almost moved to tears just recalling it now.<br /><br />As a whole I think that `Into the Wild' is a well done film, it just misses the biggest mark it sets out to make; and that is of making McCandless a real person.  I have a few issues with some of the decisions made production wise with the film (like the horrible yellow writing that scribbles across the screen...which makes the film appear kind of cheap in a way) but they are not enough to knock stars off for.  No, the only reason this film does not receive a five star rating from me is the mere fact that the final five minutes or so try and paint Chris as a changed man, and five minutes is not long enough to convince me of that.  Had Penn given Hirsch a good twenty minutes to nurse the idea then maybe it would have been convincing, but sadly it was not.alone is poorly underused (I just love her) but makes an impression as Christopher's sister Carine.

0385338724|4.0|This was a great book.  The main character is easy to like and care about.  The author gave information at just the right pace, in my opinion.  I enjoyed it thoroughly!
0743298039|5.0|I couldn't put this one down...what more can a person say about a book they enjoyed?  Seeing the reviews here makes me realize that one mans trash is another mans treasure...you can't know if it will take hold of you unless you try it.  Don't be afraid to try it.  It's a spellbinding tale, rather like Wuthering Heights, Rebecca and Jane Eyre all rolled up into one.  I had a wonderful weekend reading it and I highly recommend.
B000ICL3KG|3.0|I'm a conservative guy.  I'm open minded.  The fact that your knee jerk reaction was to laugh at the thought of an open minded conservative reveals how \\"open minded\\" YOU are.  In addition, yes, i just read your mind.  Ok, now that i've engaged you with my firm wit...allow me to continue.     Al Gore is here found to be passionate (for what that's worth in a debate that potentially equals either world wide destruction or a global economic meltdown to prevent it.  Al Gore says NOTHING to the contrary in this video.  He merely asserts, via that time honored political highway  known as \\"Platitude Way\\" that we can \\"make this work.\\"  On a side note, \\"Platitude Way\\" is currently experiencing long delays due to heavy usage by the Obama campaign.)    Al Gore uses cool graphs, and braves a mechancial lift!  (though compelling, I'm not sold on the graphs and their message of doom.  however, i was proud of Al's courage to scale the heights...and to go to china!)    Al Gore grew up on a farm and had a car wreck.  I like black angus, and by golly, Al Gore knows a thing or two about black angus!  (aren't cows creating co2 issues?)    Al Gore wants to save the planet and clearly believes, with all of his heart, that his crusade is just.  No pun.  This DVD really shows that Al Gore is not MERELY politically motivated.  his heart and mind have been engaged with this stuff for YEARS now.  I can and do respect that.  I'm unconvinced by his position, but i'm listening.    Al Gore doesn't mind the idea of raising your taxes.  I'd like to see the graph on THAT in conjection with global warming!  I'll bet he'd need a bigger lift!      it's worth watching.  Now that the hype has died down, you might be able to view it with an open mind.    stem
B000Z27HLS|5.0|You'll recognize the typical Jane Austen themes but here the protagonist seems more real, more naive than usual. The parodies of salacious novel material made me smile every time - creating a stark contrast with the very realistic subject matter of the story. Fun!
1594489505|4.0|Great book - would highly recommend.  Not usually a type of book I would read, but I loved it and will read similar books in the future!    Book is split into different sections (or different books)  Didn't realize this starting out and it threw me off when I got to Book 2.
0452287588|5.0|I'm blown away by the depth of this book. This is hands down the most profound book I've ever read. I have read countless `self-help' books but none like this. My quest has always been to go deeper and almost all the literature I've read only skim the surface of what I was searching for without actually know it. Tolle's honesty and truth is astounding.     This is a must read for everyone who knows that they are more than the physical.     Claudia
B000E5KJHA|4.0|My family enjoyed this movie in spite of several bad reviews, it was very cleverly done and never ceased to hold our attention. Our children six and almost three, ended up watching it three times in less than twenty four hours. I'm a huge Johnny Depp fan and have to admit that this is the film that I least enjoyed seeing him star in, but it was a good story.
B0013L2EDQ|4.0|The Judas Strain is the first novel by James Rollins  that I have read, and I plan to come back for more. He has done enough research in the areas of biology, history, and religion to create a plausible hypothesis that reads well in today's world. His heroes have enough believable strengths, though his villains, in my opinion, fall a little short of the mark in being truly evil. His writing is easy, and he breaks his book into short chapters like the old cliff-hangers that used to play in the movies of the 1940s and 1950s. I enjoy this style of writing because the reader is constantly changing between scenarios without getting bogged down in trying to remember who is who and what is happening.<br /><br />The only area that I found somewhat difficult to work with was his secret government agency SIGMA, and the ever popular malevolent world-dominating force known as the GUILD. It's a bit of a throwback to Ian Fleming's bad guys known as SMERSH or SPECTRE. Clive Cussler's NUMA is believable because it's transparent with a good purpose though its personnel always seem to get into a heap of trouble. Other than that one area I found The Judas Strain highly entertaining and has made me want to read up on the travels of Marco Polo.<br /><br />I believe that anybody who buys The Judas Strain will be highly entertained and even gain some knowledge regarding biology and histrory.
B000002UAX|4.0|I really enjoy listening to this album and thoroughly enjoy about five tracks. But I must admit to skipping several tracks \\"Honey Pie\\" being one of them, which is unbearable for my ears. However I do recommend the CD for eighty percent of the tracks. A great CD to add to your collection if you are a true Beatle's fan. \\"Dear Prudence\\" is absolutely one of their best tracks ever.
6304698623|3.0|I remember loving Frances Hodgson Burnett's books as a child. Secret Garden was always my favourite, and I own the DVD, and the sequel, Back To The Secret Garden. I found this on DVD ages ago, but it's taken me quite a while to get around to being in the right mood to watch this.<br /><br />I don't ever remember seeing A Little Princess before. Some scenes seem very familiar, but I don't remember seeing it. I know my mum owns the Shirley Temple version & I definitely haven't seen that one!<br /><br />I was shocked to discover that Liesel Matthews that was quite a good little actress, and even more shocked to discover that she hasn't done anything since this, apart from Air Force One and something called Blast.<br /><br />Everyone should know the story, but if not I'll give you a quick recap. It's centres around Sara in 1914, living with her father in India, until he gets called up for the war. She gets sent to a very posh boarding school, where she initially causes some trouble with her daydreaming, and vivid imagination. Gradually she makes friends, until the worst news comes - her dad has been killed.<br /><br />Look out for the late great Vincent Schiavelli, the lawyer who comes to inform the boarding school headteacher that Sara's father has been killed.<br /><br />Sara gets kept on as a servant and is made to do some awful work. But she gets through it, quite successfully. Who won't shed a tear as she tackles everything that is put in her way?<br /><br />A Little Princess is one of those movies that will make any female, no matter what age, feel like a little girl again, believing you're a princess and having everything you could ever want. Not as great as the Secret Garden, but still worth a quick look. Just to know that inside every girl is a princess.

B00009RDGA|4.0|Nine-year-old Addie Loggins is the centerpiece of Peter Bogdanovich's affectionate 1973 comedy set during the depths of the Great Depression. The filmmaker was on a roll at the time as he made the coming-of-age saga, 1971's [[ASIN:0767827902 The Last Picture Show]], and the screwball throwback, 1972's [[ASIN:B00006FDC9 What's Up, Doc?]], in quick succession. Cineaste that he is, Bogdanovich filmed this episodic, character-driven comedy deliberately in black and white, inspired by classics as diverse as Charlie Chaplin's [[ASIN:B00017LVNC The Kid]], Vittorio de Sica's [[ASIN:0571125611 Bicycle Thieves]] and even John Ford's [[ASIN:B000O599ZS The Searchers]]. The result is charming if a bit overlong for the simple story being told. As the film opens in Kansas, Addie just lost her mother, and she is to be taken to live with relatives in Missouri. Enter traveling Bible salesman Moses Pray, a small-time grifter who bilks recent widows out of cash under the pretense that their late husbands had ordered personalized Bibles before their deaths. As a chronic womanizer, he knew Addie's free-living mother and promises to take her to her relatives after he extorts $200 from a local business owner.<br /><br />The rest of the story is an entertaining road movie centered on the evolving relationship between Moses and Addie as she shows to have a greater gift for scams than he does. A tough-talking smoker who loves radio, Addie is a tomboy frequently mistaken for a boy, while Moses constantly resists his paternal feelings toward her even though they are kindred spirits. Complications occur first with the appearance of a tawdry carnival stripper named Trixie Delight, who threatens to come between Moses and Addie, and then with a bootlegger and his look-alike sheriff brother, who are in hot pursuit over a scam around crates of illegal whiskey. As Addie, Tatum O'Neal still has the distinction of being the youngest actor to win a competitive Oscar, and in her film debut, her unprecocious performance reflects refreshingly confident work from a child. Perhaps fearful that his daughter was stealing the movie, a well-founded fear it turns out, her father Ryan does some of his best screen work as Moses, better cast here than as bumbling musicologist Howard Bannister in \\"What's Up, Doc?\\".<br /><br />As she proved with her hilarious portrayal of Howard's persnickety fianc&eacute;e Eunice in \\"What's Up, Doc?\\", Madeline Kahn is an unparalleled scene-stealer as Trixie, especially as she tries to coax a belligerent Addie off a grassy hilltop. Just before peaking in Mel Brooks' farces and reunited with the elder O'Neal, Kahn shows what she can do to maximize less than half-hour of screen time. Almost as funny is the eye-rolling cynicism of P.J. Johnson as Trixie's indentured servant Imogene. The 2003 DVD has two substantial extras. First, Bogdanovich offers a full-length commentary full of his personal remembrances and sharing a deep well of cinematic knowledge. The second is Laurent Bouzereau's \\"The Making of Paper Moon\\", an exhaustive making-of featurette divided into three parts, which covers all aspects of the film's development and production and includes comments from Bogdanovich, his then-wife Polly Platt who did the production design, cinematographer L&aacute;szl&oacute; Kov&aacute;cs, and producer Frank Marshall.rmance reflects refreshingly confident work from a child.

The second is Laurent Bouzereau's \\"The Making of Paper Moon\\", an exhaustive making-of featurette divided into three parts, which covers all aspects of the film's development and production and includes comments from Bogdanovich, his then-wife Polly Platt who did the production design, cinematographer László Kovács, and producer Frank Marshall.

Also has a great section on making your own brewing equipment and a few good recipes to get the novice brewer up and running
0739340131|4.0|I am not a zombie fan by any means.  This book was actually pretty good, many of the earlier reviews didn't like the style of the writing and the charactors but they all except for the ninja guy where pretty good.      It is a interesting story that is simply told from a different view which is a nice change from the normal writing styles    I would recommend this one to anyone
0452289963|5.0|This book is must read, it is the 2nd best book I have ever read the first being \\" A Return to Love\\".  Buy this book you will not regret it.
B000J10ER4|5.0|Saw this on cable and my little boy discovered Superman.  Had to get it for him to keep and he loves it.  It's a little long for kids- he usually does not make it through the whole film.  But it's pretty tame as far as violence and focuses on being good and doing the right thing.  Good messages for kids.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|This powerful romantic drama is so heartwarming even a loving man (like me) can submit a solid \\"5\\" for this superb piece of life...reality.  If only more of us could treat our family and friends (and our husbands and wives) with the love exuded in this film, we'd be able to sing the old Beatles' song \\"All You Need Is Love\\" in past tense.  Take the one you love by the hand and watch this film...candlelight...wine...and...and...you figure it out.  Don't miss this one...even if it's only ONCE!
0452289963|1.0|I was very disappointed that I did not receive the book in a timely manner.  I was told a week after I ordered that they did not have it in stock as they thought they did and I could cancel if I did not want to wait for it.  I then tried to cancel and was told it had been shipped.  I had to wait 2 weeks before getting it and was very frustrated.

B000ICL3KG|4.0|After reading a number of negative reviews, it occurred to me that many are missing a key point of this film, that being that the Earth is tremendously complex, and that global warming presents problems that reach far beyond melting ice. While many of the effects of global warming are less than fully documented and scientifically validated, as critics are quick to point out, those who view this film as being purely political propaganda are reflecting their own biases more so than Mr. Gore's. I found this documentary to be very informative and entertaining. While Gore's personality is often referred to as \\"still\\" or \\"decaf,\\" he seems less so in this film than he did on the campaign trail, and at times he's witty and folksy. The documentary does have a political bent to it, without question, but that reflects less on Gore's speeches on the issue and more on the choices of the filmmaker to put this in a political context. And Gore's political references have less to do with Republicans and Democrats than with a general political culture that does not handle a problem until it grows to gargantuan proportions. My sole complaint about this film is that it focuses almost entirely on causes and (sometimes potential) effects, rather than solutions. This is to a purpose. His case is meant to tie enough issues to global warming that it simply overwhelms objections. If you view this film with an open mind, as I tried to do, it's an interesting and informative, but not entirely unbiased look at what is quickly becoming a critical issue. If you come into it aggressive in defense of your own biases that this is a non-issue, then you'll likely not enjoy it.
0783240287|5.0|When I was a kid, for Donny Osmond, my mom took me to the Fox Theater in Detroit, MI to see this play.  Donny Osmond was Joseph when we went, it was his first night back playing him.  It was an amazing concert that got me into music.  When this movie was released years later, I loved it because it's the imagination of this play meant to be seen by kids in a major hollywood production.  I love it, I love it and I love it, and I'm not even Christian.
B00005R23Z|5.0|This movie is a post modern classic. Wonderfully filmed, with a great story. It is not science fiction, though it might sort of fit the genre. It is more along the lines of Farenheit 451, a Clock Work Orange, and 1984.
0805047905|5.0|People are drawn to this book for its eye-catching illustrations, but the rhythm and simplicity of the text are also wonderful.  As you read this book aloud, it almost feels like singing. The story is straight-forward and engaging enough to hold a toddler's attention. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Review by Sherry North, Author, [[ASIN:0810994828 Because You Are My Baby]]
B000BRBA8S|2.0|The trailer was better than the movie. Though it was beautifully filmed it was to long. The trailer was a bit misleading, but no spoiler here. If the movie was 30 minutes shorter it would have been better, it had more false endings than Lord of the Rings. I would have loved to give it a five, but it just didn't make the cut!
0920668372|3.0|Review by Sherry North, Author, [[ASIN:0810994828 Because You Are My Baby]]<br /><br />Love You Forever explores the unbreakable bond between mother and son, but goes too far for many readers.  It has an appealing refrain to reassure your child you will \\"like him for always\\" and \\"love him forever.\\" The rhythm of this refrain makes it a good choice to read to babies. However, as children get older, they may feel uncomfortable watching the mother climb in through the window of her adult son's bedroom. Boys seem particularly uneasy about the illustration of the grown-up son rocking the aging mother in his arms.
0307388840|4.0|The best aspect of this book is the writing because it is flawless, but there are more problems than most reviewerslead on. Though interesting, the story does not really start for about 100 pages, and part II is very tedious to keep reading. I thought the war scenes were incredibly pointless and added nothing to Robbie Turner's character development. The ending is also very devastating. Overall, this is worth reading, but you will have to be patient.
B0007YN74A|4.0|Review by Sherry North, Author, [[ASIN:0810994828 Because You Are My Baby]]<br /><br />Ten Apples Up on Top is a good introduction to counting and addition for preschoolers. My 3-year-old loves it. He counts the apples on every page and never gets bored. Me, on the other hand - I would have liked the book to have more of a storyline.
1593080255|5.0|`So, Henry, how is that young Prot&eacute;g&eacute;e of yours progressing, hem?<br />Lord Henry paused to saviour his glass. Pleased, he set it down, just so, beside his dinner plate, and turned to Lord Fermor.<br /> `Pundits say troubles come in threes, Uncle,' replied Lord Henry. `What the pundits omit in their gabardine rush to spread their misery to others in a foolish attempt to alleviate their own, is that the best in life never travels solo. Take, for example, the wine and dinner before us. Both French. Together they constitute a meal to entice the gods down from the Mount. When did you ever come across a bad French meal, or a good French man? Yet when wine and food march together, they repay the Creator.'<br /> `No doubt,' replied Lord Fermor, `but you evade the issue. I asked about the young chap you have taken into your entourage, you know.' Lord Fermor struggled to recall the name, `that chap who poses for Mr Hallward here.'<br /> Basil Hallward felt the heat of recognition first on his brow, then running through his whole body. A retiring man, more at home with his easels and sitters than at high table, he shrank from the public glare.<br />Recognising the signs, though failing to sympathise with them, Lady Agatha piped up.<br />`Mr Hallword has many sitters, do you not, Sir.'<br />`Er, yes, indeed I do,' replied Mr Hallward, grateful for the prompt. `For example, just today I encountered a young man of exquisite appearance, youth in all its pomp. He has promised to sit for me. Lord Henry, I fancy, will try to take him away and teach him of the world, thereby spoiling him as a object d'art.' He laughed to denote humour, simultaneously glancing at his friend to convey the serious meaning behind his joke. Keep away Lord Henry, the glanced announced, shielded behind the laughter. Keep away from this young man lest you send him on the eternal search for fulfilment and in so doing corrupt his soul.<br />Lord Henry roared.<br />\\"Why Basil, you surpass yourself! Hiding a serious message behind a joke so that you may deliver it in public. Would that the Good Book decked itself in such garlands, the better to frighten the masses. You are a greater artist than your canvasses know.'<br />`I fear my husband is avoiding your question, Lord Fermor,' laughed Lady Victoria. `When it comes to hiding a serious message behind the veil of farce, he may rival Dante himself.'<br />`What is the name of your young beauty?' Inquired Lord Henry amidst the general humour. `I only ask,' he pressed, `so that I may avoid him. Let us hope I have more success than Eve, who expressed no desire to harvest the only tree in the garden that contained a serpent, until admonished not to. Of course,' Lord Henry continued, `our Creator did not warn off the firstborn with laughter on his lips. Had he done so, perhaps we would be consuming ambrosia still. Mind you,' he reflected, `this French cuisine is an adequate substitute.'<br />`Yes yes yes Henry,' broke in Lord Fermor, `but what about your young Prot&eacute;g&eacute;e? Has he a fine future, seeking the dark mysteries of life of which you profess to be so fond?'<br />`Should he avoid hubris, I see for him a long, comfortable and satisfactory life.'<br />`And should he fail to avoid hubris?' teased Lady Agatha.<br />`Then I see for him immortality in print and prose. Hubris is man's affirmation of his living soul, his insistence that all must be as he ordains, and his rage that it is not. Should Basil paint hubris he would reveal Caliban.<br />`Modesty, on the other hand, is pleasing to the casual senses but fleeting, like snow on the chimneystack. Modesty and prose combine to produce the barely adequate. Hubris and prose combine to produce immortality, but not personal happiness.'<br />`And this choice, modesty of hubris, is one you see before Dorian Gray?' queried Mr Hallword.<br />`Dorian who?' Lord Henry responded. He reached again for the reassuring certainty in his wine glass. `I was referring tomy Prot&eacute;g&eacute;e, Oscar Wilde.'
B0006Q1UL6|5.0|Review by Sherry North, Author, [[ASIN:0810994828 Because You Are My Baby]]<br /><br />I loved Are You My Mother? as a child, but I wasn't sure how my son would react. His world is filled with Spider-Man and Transformers, so how could a baby bird hold his attention? It turns out my concerns were unfounded. The story of a baby bird looking for Mama is as timeless as they come. My son's brow furrows with worry as the bird approaches a construction site looking for Mama. When the baby and Mama are reunited, my son is content. This story shows that, as bad as things might seem, everything turns out alright in the end - a very reassuring message for young kids.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|Episodes in their extended versions  Beautiful boxset  Great little book included  Nice bonus features  Perfect
B0011KQSZ4|2.0|saw this movie over the weekend and it was predictable and the punch lines were a dime a dozen. the pacing was hit and miss as well. I expected to like it once the actual funneral started but then the film became one big cliche and it reminded me of a few other better films in the same vein which this one was desperately trying to channel.
6301640659|5.0|I remember seeing this when it first came out.  It was a rather taboo movie because it didn't hold back on the hard core gay leather life that is incorporated in the movie.  Pacino did an excellent job of pulling off what the gay leatherman acted and looked like in the 70's and early 80's. The scenes of the clubs are pretty much the way it really was like
B000WCBPOG|5.0|These are great renditions of classic Beatles songs.  I am a Beatles fan despite growing up in the 80's and 90's, and this movie and soundtrack have really done John, Paul, George and Ringo proud.  They have effectively ushered these songs into the twenty first century for a new generation to enjoy.<br /><br />Songs from the Beatles' early days, such as, \\"I want to hold your hand\\" and \\"All my loving\\" especially benefit from an updating that tones down a bee-bop doo-whop sound that people now just in their twenties and thirties will never understand.  No fault to the Beatles, they were just victims of the time period.<br /><br />As someone who grew up on musicals like \\"Annie\\" and \\"Grease\\", it's great to see a new musical after many years geared to adults in movie format that somehow manages to avoid being totally corny.  This is a great collection of songs that I will be sure to enjoy for years to come...alongside the incomparable originals, of course!<br /><br />Of course the purists aren't going to like these covers, that goes without saying.  I am not sure why such an individual would even leave a review here, except for the opportunity to complain.  Bottom line is that it's an inspired and creative album, period.<br /><br />I saw that one reviewer claimed it is sinful to remake Beatle's tunes.  If Paul and Ringo themselves don't mind, (which they don't, they both praised the film), then it shouldn't bother anyone else either.
0810993139|5.0|I had read a good review about this book and wanted to give it to my 12 year old great nephew.  As I skimmed through it, I found some really funny stuff that reminded me of my childhood thoughts. So I read it!  Didn't take long, but it was quite funny and my great nephew thought so too!
B000YEUUCK|5.0|I was very impressed with the image and sound quality of this Blu-ray disc.  It made me feel as if I was actually in Las Vegas watching the show.  This is what I purchased my Klipsh surround sound, Sony 1080p  LCD television, and Yamaha receiver for. It was candy to my ears.  Oh, by the way, the actual concert was very good also.  This is a must own even if you don't like Celine Dion.
B00003CX5P|5.0|This DVD was the last part of my Star Wars DVD collection. It's a great item. Discs contain lots of features that you can't see everywhere easily. You should listen to the orchestra conducted by John Williams. It's amazing!
B000WMFZMY|2.0|Overall disappointed.  The DVD gave me some trouble, but most of all while the soundtrack was good and loud, the volume had to be turned way up on the dialogue.
B000UR9T8C|3.0|So I kept waiting for something to happen, the movie was primarily focused on the love story of MJ and Peter which is great but was thinking there would be a lot more action.  Don't get me wrong, there were definitely exciting moments but overall I was hoping for a little less gush and a little more action!
0385333846|4.0|Well written but the plot really does jump around quite a bit because he is time traveling, quite often from the past to the future back and forth.  I read it because someone had told me the lead character was an optometrist, which is what i do.  The book on its own which tries to portray the horror that was the bombing of Dresden actually witnessed by the author seems strangely included in this science fiction time story including an alien planet called Tralfalmadore.  It just seems weird to me that the important truth of the horrific firebombing of people and the incredible loss of life should be juxtaposed to twilight zone science fiction of man in a zoo on the Tralfalmadore planet.  Odd mix but for some reason i do revisit the images from the book.  Quite honestly, if it weren't considered a classic I'd probably be more apt to give it 3 stars.
0307237702|4.0|What ever ones persuasion in the political arena, Barrack Obama has captured the essence of an uplifting attitude. It is hard to find yourself  remaining on neutral ground. We have to hope that this essence of optimism is not wrung out of his being, and that in some form or another he becomes an important part of American political history.    Another enjoyable read when one wants a bit of relaxation, is FLYING NORTH SOUTH EAST AND WEST, which proves that, like Obama, it is still possible to succeed in this country regardless of humble beginnings.[[ASIN:0595687016 Flying North South East and West: Arctic to the Sahara]]
B000YMBBH0|5.0|just a good trilogy of movies and extra special in HD highly recommend for the surround sound.  great improvement over DVD.... now its just time to move to Blu-ray or dual format players.
1881273156|5.0|This is a must buy for all teenagers and adults who have not read it yet.  I love this book, it has changed my life and many others.
B000TJ6CPY|5.0|I knew that this priceless session had recently seen a domestic reissue, but try as I might I couldn't do better than scare up previous, pricey oop editions, Japanese imports, the other session with Oscar and Clark Terry (perhaps equally worthy, but I wanted the \\"Mumbles\\" date for a grand child).  Whatever's awry with Amazon's search protocol, if you've found this page, that's half the battle.  Amazon's One-Click purchase system makes the rest a piece of cake.<br /><br />The session is worth owning even though these musicians are so familiar to most listeners by now the proceedings are pretty much as expected. On the other hand, I had assumed Oscar would be in his \\"quiet and deferential\\" mode, taking it as easy on Clark as possible. Forget that. Clark takes the initiative and motivates the trio to match him stride for rollicking stride. Oscar is not simply doing his Verve \\"house pianist\\" thing for Norman Granz but is fully engaged in the humor, good spirits, and downright swinging earthiness of the proceedings. And no question that Ray Brown and Ed Thigpen are having an equally good time.<br /><br />Definitely one of Oscar's better studio albums as an accompanist and a session that kids of all ages deserve to hear. C.T. is equally communicative on the horn (sometimes two of them) as well as his \\"mumbles mode,\\" and besides playing pretty fair piano, Oscar himself is, as usual, prone to his own non-musical vocalizations.<br /><br />(Minor quibble: the documentation with this edition--mine, at least--is spartan, to say the least. This meeting deserves far better--a description of the pre-recording circumstances as well as the session itself and perhaps even some after-history of this foursome.)
0321544080|4.0|I found this book to be both inspirational and a great reminder of the many many techniques needed to get great pictures.      I found the discussions about light (not just artificial lighting) very insightful.    The author's writing style is a bit unprofessional; borders on street lingo but the content is good.    This is not a \\"first book on photography\\", but is instead a great book for those that have been taking pictures for quite some time.
0312330537|3.0|This is a wonderful story for the first nineteen chapters; after that it changes and it's not nearly as good. The \\"change\\" is sudden and unexpected. You will enjoy the first nineteen chapters, the first 400 pages of this 900 page book, and you won't take my advice to stop reading at that point, as I was advised to do. You will read on, as I did, expecting the magic and charm to return, and even when they don't you'll want to tie up all those loose strings.<br /><br />The first nineteen chapters are a book about India. We read this for my book club, and we were fortunate to have a guest who had grown up in India, to answer our questions about all the strange and fantastic things this white, Australian, ex-con author was telling us. It turns out that what he wrote about Indian ways and culture is true, and our guest even demonstrated the Indian head waggle!<br /><br />This story offers more than an intimate glimpse at India; it is also a provocative lesson on redemption for all sins, not just the ones that can land you in a jail. It also offers a few lessons on love.<br /><br />But after chapter nineteen the story is no longer really about India, and the main character, Lin, is no longer a \\"normal\\" man in extraordinary circumstances. Lin becomes a kind of superman involved in one cliff-hanging circumstance after another. The story and the characters are no longer endearing; they become larger-than-life cardboard \\"heroes\\" in an action movie. The reader no longer learns anything of value about India or the characters. And that's too bad, because it didn't have to go that way; there was enough going in the first 400 pages to carry it every bit as well to 900.<br /><br />I will mention, too, that Gregory Roberts could write a compelling story about being in prison, if Australian prisons really are as bad as he claims. Perhaps he will.
B000002C1W|5.0|The secret to Pink Floyd's success always was and always will be the incredible SOUND they put out and it's mainstay, David's guitars. Everyone said that without Waters they'd be Kaput! NOT SO! With Roger Waters departure, after years of court fighting, you'll see the remaining members of Pink Floyd came out the winners and I thank GOD that Roger Waters and his over inflated ego are GONE! This album marked the new begining for the band. During his tenure, Waters did crank out some memorable lyrics and a few good tunes, but, without the remainder of the band, and without Alan Parsons at the controls, Roger Waters is really pretty much the \\"has been\\" here. Not since Dark Side Of The Moon, has the remaining members of the band been allowed to shine as brightly as they have here on \\"A Momentary Lapse Of Reason\\". I heard \\"Learning To Fly\\" on the radio and \\"KNEW\\" instantly that it was Pink Floyd and it was new and I had to have it immediately! It was money well spent and I've since purchased 2 copies of the CD. One for the house, one for the car. My children grew up listening to Pink Floyd. But, their first introduction to them was \\"A Momentary Lapse Of Reason\\". They were instant fans. My favorite story about my children knowing Pink Floyd is when we were having a conversation about them and my one child that bought this album shortly after I did and wound up loving them as much as I do said: \\"Who's Roger Waters?\\".  Aha! I said, my point, exactly!
0143038419|5.0|I can't say enough about this book. It's insightful, witty, moving, and beautifully written. After reading it, I purchased four more copies to give as gifts and all the recipients have given it enthusiastic praise. I'm not going to go on and on here...just buy this book and be prepared to have your spirit and senses nurtured with Gilbert's delightful prose. One of the best books I've read in a long time.
1932907009|5.0|With \\"Save the Cat\\" Blake Snyder has broken down the screenwriting process to the precise craft that it is. With humor and insight, he's taken his wealth of knowledge accumulated over many years of successful screenwriting and defined the process of developing a \\"good idea\\" into a saleable product in easily repeatable steps.    Even though I'm a seasoned, veteran writer, I still found Snyder's insights and tools invaluable. (I wish I knew this stuff 20 years ago!)    STC is not only for screen-writers, it's for screen-watchers as well. If you've ever wondered why you loved one film while not enjoying another apparently very similar one, this book will show you how to understand the difference.    A quick and entertaining read, Save the Cat is a must for anyone, expert and novice alike, interested in the process and machinery of creating a successful screen story.
0765318741|5.0|Who else could create something so masterful? I have always wanted to contct him in some way to tell him how remarkable he is. I could go on and on about this book. This not about vampires but about the human condition.  Should we remain as we are are or turn to something that might be greater
1400049628|5.0|Here's the thing, I wasn't too sure about this book when I picked it up, however I'm glad that I did.  Max Brooks style of writing makes this book seem like a non-fiction guide.  I could barley put it down.  This will also be an excellent guide for the upcoming Palladium Books pen and paper RPG, Dead Reign.  After I read about Dead reign, I was able to take my knowledge from the Zombie Survival Guide as a Class 4 outbreak and write an almost entire story for Dead Reign.  This book is so much fun, as is World War Z, which I also highly recommend.
0743496736|5.0|I was first mesmerized by Jodi Picoult's writing and storytelling abilities when I read My Sister's Keeper.  That book is in the top 5 of my list of best books ever read (up there with Gone With the Wind and The Kite Runner) and I've been trying to read her extensive backlist ever since.<br /><br />In Nineteen Minutes, Ms. Picoult again tells a story that pinches at the heart of any parent.  She vividly portrays the emotions of her characters, making it difficult for the reader to take sides as we're deftly led into the minds of victims and teenage gunman until it's clear that there really aren't any true 'bad' guys or 'good' guys--we're all fighting our own battles with whatever weapons we have.<br /><br />Beautifully rendered, this is a story that will linger in your mind long after you've read it.  Brava, Ms. Picoult.

0143038583|4.0|I'm not sure why I picked up this book, but I'm sure glad I did. It has truly changed my eating habits. Pollan reveals the dark side of industrial farming, and expains the damage done to the animals, the environment and to the health of those who eat the food. I am now only eating 100% grass-fed pastured beef, along with pastured poultry and eggs, and raw milk, in addition to all the local, organic produce I can find. Anyone who finds this book interesting should also check out the Weston A Price Foundation website. They have lots of information about traditional foods and health. An eye opener!

1594489505|5.0|I'm 44 years old and this is the best book I've ever read. I would advise anyone to buy this book.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|I seldom bother with movies, as very few manage to be historically accurate, remain on subject, and manage to compel me to keep watching them.   This movie manages to accomplish all this, and more.  A period piece for setting and costume, it stays true to it's subjects, and manages to be relevant even today.... maybe even especially today.    Wilberforce was evidently an amusing, positive and very agile minded individual (as well as one seriously occupied with thoughts of morality), and that is how he is portrayed.  His character comes off as likeable, rather quirky, and of considerable personal force.  He is also shown as a man, capable of stumbling and falling, losing faith in himself, but not above accepting the support of friends, and especially a good and strong willed woman.    This is the story of the fight to abolish a profound evil, and slavery itself is not the centre-piece of the story:  rather the fight against it is.  Enough of the evil is presented, not casually, but with simple statements and examples of fact (and in one scene, odour).  A lot is said, with an amazing compactness of words.  Surprisingly effective.    The machinations that are on the route to ultimately succeeding in passing the legislation are quickly covered, and the (generally speaking) happy ending is attained.    The characters are consistently believable, but none are portrayed as sainted...  All are obviously human beings, with feet of clay, as are we all.  Several actors should have been in line for Academy awards (Finney for one), but given the nature of the story (good being done by good people), that didn't seem likely to happen.    Every now and then, you see or hear of someone that convinces you that, warts and all, maybe the human race has enough of value in it, to worth endless second chances.  This movie is about such people.    Very highly recommended.
B000Z6MIQS|1.0|If you liked simple plan's last two records, prepare to be disappointed. There are only two songs here that sound anything like what the band has done in the past, and one of them is a JP bonus track. So really, there's only one good song on the whole 12 track effort! Pop-punk is supposed to be fun, and simple plan used to do it as well if not better than everyone else, but there's nothing fun about waiting three plus years for such a terrible record.
0143038419|5.0|I read this book over the summer and I thought it was fantastic.  Gilbert's voice is very real and sincere.  She also weaves a very likeable and understandable story of disappointment and recovery.  I think readers will enjoy hearing of her trying to truly immerse herself in three distinct cultures (though I confess my favorite part was the beginning, when the author travels throughout Italy).  At times touching, and at times self-indulgent, she never seems false.  This book was a true gem from cover to cover.

B000TEUSJK|1.0|The worst crime of this movie is not all the depravation, waste of money or the fact that it is a porn film; the worst part is that it is soooo boring. I found time to fold my laundry, clear my e-mail and read the reviews on this movie. There are some good scenes here and there, some emotional as well (when Drusilla dies)...everything else is blah. What a waste of money this was. It fails as a porn film, as a historical film and as a film.
B000JVT09C|5.0|I have seen all the originals, all of Smallville, and most of the cartoons. This was a well made movie. Very much like the stuff mentioned above. There was a few twists they could have done without but still very good. Blu-ray totally the way to go looked amazing.
B000JIHP88|5.0|We own the FP bassinet that has a similar mobile and bought this one for our son's crib at daycare.

Also, this product is very easy to install quickly and battery life seems pretty good.
B000K15VSA|5.0|All the permutations of movie that I know of, and a couple I didn't know of are included.  Differences are subtle (different takes on different scenes,) to profound (the narration in the original release, Holden's scene in the hospital.)  I was more than surprised the significant impact and implications these changes had in the story itself.  Be prepared to spend several days watching and re-watching every version.  I found great insight into what Scott was thinking and his options on where the movie would go.

B0010358D0|4.0|Back in 2004, Appleseed came stateside, after being in Japan for years. For it's time, it had great special effects alongside some of the best CGI seen. Now its 2008, and Appleseed Ex Machina is here. I must say, CGI just keeps getting better, and this is a shining example of that. Animations, facial expressions and the lip-movement when the characters are talking help bring this anime life. Since John Woo helped produce the sequel, expect to see some of his trademarks, like the doves and slow motion sequences. But they all fit into the movie perfectly. For being a sequel, I am surprised how this turned out. However, if I have to pick out one gripe, that would be the dialog. Some of the lines can get on the cheesy side. Other than that, be sure to give this a look if you've seen the original. Otherwise, if you are the least bit interested in  GCI/Anime, still give this one a chance.
6304779356|4.0|The lost boys is an action packed, and has an awesome cast of characters. Kieffer Sutherland plays the lead vampire, who leads a gang of \\"lost boys\\" who are vampires. When Micahel and Sam move to Santa Carla, they don't realize that they call it the murder capitol of the world for nothing. They are about to find out, where all the lost and missing children have gone, or better yet what they have \\"become\\". The gang is after Micahel, and it's a battle for dawn when he tries to save his friends. This is a great action/horror flick of the 80's, everyone should have it in their collection!

B000JVT1U0|2.0|The Wickerman, is not a typical horror movie. I don't know what genre I would even put it in. It's weird. A police man from the mainland (in scotland) is in search of a missing girl. He travels out to this island, where all the people who live there have a \\"different' way of living. He gets the run around from every towns person on the island, when he asks the whereabouts of the girl. The island's people perform ritials, and parade around with animal costumes on, and have strange beliefs, it's like they are hippy types..It seems the missing girl may be dead? Or is she just bait, for \\"The Wickerman?
B000WTNCQS|5.0|For starters I can't believe that over twenty years have gone by since U2 planted their flag on the world with \\"The Joshua Tree\\". I was always lukewarm towards this group but this special limited edition brought me into the fold. Although I believe its over priced by at least $10.00, I applaud the serious work that went into this beautiful package. This should be the standard by which reissues should be measured.
B00004ZEQX|1.0|This movie sucks! It's very weird, and dubbed in english. It's about a family that movies into a house by a cemetery. In the basement there is this creepy, warped, leatherface kinda guy. They don't know that he lives in the basement, and strange things happen. It's just a waste of money, it's a little bloody, but not done tastefully. It's kind of hard to follow and all over the place...PASS on this one...

B000U618C8|5.0|Even from the first beats of 'How Low' I am put into a pseudo-trance-like state.  At the time of the album's release I was reading [[ASIN:0061122416 The Alchemist]], which takes place in Spain and involves a trek into Egypt.  Perhaps it is because the coinciding exposures that I attach a visual of arid climates and personal journey with this collection.  Geez, I am beginning to sound like a Pitchfork reviewer.    Although the artist is mostly marketed based on his Swedish upbringing, he did receive ample exposure to Latin culture.  It shows heavily in his finger-picking technique, and I feel like this album would be in the rotation at a trendy Argentinian coffee house.    I think this album has more rhythm than its predecessor, Veneer.  What I mean by that is even from the get-go I find my heel slowly tapping to the tempo.  The ambiance also seems to be slightly darker here as well.    As was previously stated, this 'In Our Nature' is not going to change your life.  It is simply well-executed acoustic rhythms that can soothe you or dissolve behind you.    RIYL: [[ASIN:B000Q364UG The Cloud of Unknowing]], [[ASIN:B000025XKM Pink Moon]]
0743496736|5.0|What a great book!  She tackled a tough subject and really made you see a tragedy from all sides.  I was a little disappointed with the \\"surprise\\".  I kind of saw it coming and didn't like it for the characters involved but besides that I really enjoyed it.  I like a book that makes me think and feel (even if it makes me feel uncomfortable) and this did both- I loved it!
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|NO SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW    I don't know if I'm just deprived from watching a good series or if it is truly a reflection of just how good this one is, but this is probably the best TV series I have ever watched.  I was a bit worried that the gore factor would be too much for my stomach.  Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of clever crime drama movies like Seven or Silence of the Lambs or Zodiac, but the newer Saw-type movies leave me more nauseated and feeling weird than truly intrigued and in a state of mystery/suspense.  The power of Dexter is two-fold: the characters you grow to love in the stories and the intriguing plot lines that exponentially pull the viewer in with each subsequent episode.  The following are a couple of non-spoiling thoughts.    The Gore Factor:    This series is not the Saw-like gore fest.  There is more than enough blood and CSI-like crime scenes 'after the fact', and there are plenty of times when you know what is about to happen before a killing, but you never see the actual acts the way Saw movies show, thank goodness.  After watching a couple of shows, you get to trust that the makers are at least merciful in that respect.  That being said, if you get queasy with the themes in a movie like Seven or Silence of the Lambs or even with CSI-type series, this is not for you (there are plenty of disembodied dead corpses you see on the crime scenes--Dexter is a `blood splatter analyst'), and of course, the subject matter is fairly dark (though thematically the show is `lighter' than something like Seven or Silence of the Lambs, because the characters involved are quite likable, and there are sprinkles of comedy relief throughout).    Dexter--the character:    Here's an oxymoron that might disturb the viewer: he's an affable serial killer.  Within a few episodes, if one buys in to the scenario, one may actually find oneself vaguely rooting for Dexter as if he were a comic book figure making right the injustices in the world that cry out for a reckoning.  The moral dilemma comes when you ask yourself if it is good to be rooting for someone like this.  His likability comes in part by the relationships the series' characters develop with him, and his narration throughout the series, which reveal his struggle to fit in with the rest of normal society, and with the sub-plotline involving past scenes of Dexter's relationship with his adoptive father (a former beloved and decorated police officer).  In some ways, Dexter's likability comes by his unbeknownst `good' effects that he has on the various people he's involved with in everyday life.  The viewer may also get a sense that Dexter begins to approach his own humanity as the series progresses, due to his own explorations of his past, and the other external events happening around him, which force him to begin a journey into his own psyche.    Other Characters:    I found that by the closing episodes, I had fallen in love with the various supporting characters in the stories.  With that comes suspense.  One starts to worry about his partner, sibling, office comrades, boss, etc., and there are subplots to the show not directly relating to Dexter, which allows the viewer to get glimpses in the other characters' lives.  This only adds to the overall suspense in many respects.    Plot lines (absolutely no spoilers):    Though this is a series, there are on-going story lines involving mysterious characters and events that will intrigue the viewer.  There are unexpected twists, `who done it?' type questions, and character development stories: all of which are absorbing and keep the viewer considerably more attentive with each passing episode.  Due to the fact that each episode is built on previous plotlines, it's important to watch them in order.    Hope this might help!
0446613444|4.0|This is my third Connelly book. I really like the way he writes and the story moves along quickly. But I have two complaints.    First, he doesn't seem to use contractions. \\"I am going..\\" \\"I will do that...\\"  I didn't notice it at first but now I can't not notice it. Using \\"I'm\\" and \\"I'll\\" is not jargon. It's standard English. People in a hurry don't say \\"I am leaving this place.\\"     Second, almost every male character (particularly in authority) is treated with active contempt by Bosch. I realize he's an outsider but, c'mon. He can't be openly hostile to every person he meets.  I understand willing suspension of disbelief, but that concept shouldn't be very much evident in police procedurals that rely heavily on realism.    Other than those two things, the books are great.

B00003CXGG|3.0|This is one Jet Li movie I believe could've been better if Li was the villian and Russell Wong was the lead!<br />Try as they will, Jet and Aaliyah did not have the chemistry to pull off a believable romance, not too mention, they didn't even look good together. Handsome Russell Wong, on the otherhand, could've easily pulled off a realistic romance with the beautiful Aaliyah.(RIP)
B0001XALTG|5.0|Trainspotting and the second major performance of Mcgregor redefined cinema. Everything from the look to the feel is brilliant.
B000ZOXDFA|2.0|I loved the first movie, Elizabeth.  The Golden Age, however, does not live up to my hopes of a solid sequel.  Though it shares the same general look as its predacessor and some continuity of the characters and their personal story lines, it is much less polished.  Though the love Elizabeth had for Bess was evident, I did not feel any believable chemistry between Elizabeth and Walter.  Cate Blanchett is a great actress but I felt the movie was cut in such a way that the queen appears to be a flurry of emotion shifting in every which direction and hardly having the time for it to soak-in between frames. The scenes needed to be longer or else more cleverly melded together to build the appropriate tension and further develop the characters.  The gory scenes only appeared to add to the problem of time - taking precious minutes away from what would have drawn me more into the plot.  It was frustrating to watch this movie after the masterpiece that came before it.
1400064627|5.0|this is a great book.it goes into alot of detail you dont get in the movie
B0010ZR160|2.0|I saw this movie last night and during the first hour, I said to myself, \\"Wow, this is one of the best movie I've seen. How come the Oscars totally ignored this movie?\\" Sadly, the answer dawned on me during the last 20 minutes of this film. Spoilers now ahead...<br /><br />Apparently, the movie portrayed Boston as a city in some Third World country; no one in this movie has heard of Child Welfare Services. If the girl's mother is unfit, the uncle could have easily contacted welfare services to take the child away and then adopt her legallyor put her in a foster home.. Why is there a need to come up with a convuluted kidnapping scheme involving the police and drug dealers? I'm shaking my head as I type this; it is just that ridiculous of a plot.

0740748475|5.0|I was hesitant to purchase this item after reading the various disparaging reviews in regards to the binding and overall quality. (Many people have had issues with glued rather than stitched binding causing pages to fall out, I have also heard people mention the pictures on the cover of each book were glued on squares that peeled off when taking the volumes in and out.) However, being a hardcore C&H \\"Fanboy\\" I was willing to take what I could get... and I have NO REGRETS! The first thing I noticed about the volumes was that the pictures on the front and back of each one were NOT GLUED ON they were printed. I then opened the book to examine the binding, I am no expert but it sure looked stitched to me, there was string at various points running through minute holes from top to bottom. I even bent it furthur back than you normally would during normal use and it stood up to the \\"abuse\\" beautifully! Curious as to why my set had none of the flaws I read about I flipped to the \\"legal jargon\\" page where I noted the Print Dates. 1st Printing October 2005, 4th Printing October 2006.. I have not confirmed this with Andrews & McMeel but it would appear that these issues have been corrected in the latest printing. SWEEEET! (I would be interested to hear from the people with issues to see what print dates they have.) Long story Longer, this set is beautifully put together and is a must have for any Fan or \\"Fanboy\\"!  The price on Amazon is amazingly reasonable when you factor in the FREE SHIPPING and I add up how much money I spent on the originals. Treat yourself, you totally deserve it!

B00005JMAH|5.0|As the first director change in this series, Alfonso Cuaron had big shoes to fill. Not only did he fill them, but he has delivered a fantastic film that is not only as good as the previous two, but surpasses them.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber of Secrets immensely. I just happened to enjoy Prisoner of Azkaban immensely-er. The acting continues to get better and better, as Daniel Radcliffe turns in a very good performance. The movie stays true to the book, without repeating it exactly. It's the same, and fresh at the same time.<br /><br />The SFX team nailed the dementors. They really provided the most terrifying effect they could without actually coming off the screen and sucking happiness out of the audience.<br /><br />And then, the final sequence with the time-turner was executed to perfection. Buckbeak was awesome, Gary Oldman was casted perfectly. Lupin was played well, too.<br /><br />I just can't say enough good things about this film. I don't even think five stars does it justice.
B00005LIN0|5.0|\\"Porgy & Bess\\" is George Gershwin's masterpiece and one of the 10 greatest operas ever written (see my list on Amazon).  For a long time (and even now ... Leonard Maltin's review, e.g.) condescendingly called a \\"folk opera\\" (translation: \\"the Met won't do it\\").  Bollocks.  True, Gershwin himself used the term, probably an attempt to slip it into acceptance through the back door.  It's not only one of the grandest of grand operas, it's the ultimate verismo opera, outshining anything from Italy.      Porgy was first performed in 1935.  It only slowly gained acceptance, mostly because of racial prejudice.  However, if Porgy itself were racist, as claimed by some cretinous looneys, the establishment would have had it performed all over.  A version of Porgy, severely chopped by about half, was filmed in 1959.  In 1976, a complete performance was mounted by the Houston Grand Opera.  The Met premiere followed in 1985.  No film recording of either has ever been released.  In 1993 Simon Rattle recorded a performance on outside sets (the actual singing provided - as in many films - by lip-synch.  This is the current DVD.  In 2002 a revival of the Houston version was recorded at the Lincoln Center, but not yet released.  The appearance of the 1959 film is held up by difficulties with the Gershwin family.    Added note: a number of low-rating reviews on this site seem to believe that the 1959 hack-job film is the \\"original\\" or \\"real\\" Porgy and Bess.  Hearty-har-har.  Come on, people; try to get the facts before sticking your feet in your faces.  The \\"original\\" or \\"real\\" Porgy was on stage in 1935 and is twice as long as the deeply mutilated version filmed in 1959.    Of these versions, Houston's is the best.  The 1959 version was savagely hacked but had some first-rate performances.  I've not seen the Lincoln Center offering.  Rattle's disc is very, very good.    Rattle had a fundamental and creative understanding of the jazz idiom.  If anyone harbors the misconception that Porgy is a light-weight work, Rattle will put quits to it.  (Compare, for instance, Gershwin's storm with those of earlier opera masters such as Rossini or Wagner: he stands with them as at least an equal.)    Porgy is here well staged.  The sets are a masterful recreation of a poor fishing village in 1930s South Carolina.  Much of the singing and of the sparse dialogue are lip-synched.  This is a common procedure in Hollywood, but these performers, though well-rehearsed, are just not as experienced as American actors.  The result is the occasional mismatch.  No biggie.  The outdoor staging allows some extra perks, such as taking us outside into the storm when Crown goes in search of Clara.  The performance, however, is incomplete.  Rattle makes the traditional cut (which Houston restores) of the poignant Buzzard Song in Act II.  As a great bonus, this isn't the usual stand-up-and-sing performance in which, during big arias, everyone else stands there and tries to vanish into the scenery.      Rattle's cast is first-rate.  Porgy is Willard White, a classically trained singer with a commanding stage presence and bass-baritone voice.  When this man threatens to take Sportin' Life apart, or to kill Crown, we know he can do it.  In the 1959 film, Poitier's excellent Porgy still has a more limited range and isn't as dominant on-scene.  His singing voice is that of Robert McFerrin Sr., father of the better-known Bobby McFerrin.  McFerrin's voice is fine for the part, and he sings with intelligence and art; however, he's not quite as authoritative as White.    Bess is Cynthia Haymon, a classically trained soprano who is as much at home with Monteverdi or Puccini as with Gershwin.  If anyone is Bess, she is, to the nines.  Her face is not only beautiful, it is interesting and enormously expressive.  Her singing is poignant and her performance riveting.  In the 1959 film, Dorothy Dandridge is equally attractive and expressive.  Her singing voice is that of Adele Addison, a classically trained soprano who mastered many styles from Baroque forward, but was particularly associated with 20th-Century composers such as Foss, Poulenc, and Bernstein.  Her performance is perhaps a little less ravishing than Haymon's, but nonetheless first-rate.  There is a wide-spread opinion that Dandridge should have been allowed to do her own singing.  True: an \\"opera\\" voice was substituted for an idiomatic voice.    The rôle of Sportin' Life is in some ways absolutely central to a successful Porgy.  He is a refreshing contrast to the almost oppressive religiosity in Catfish Row.  He drives or helps to drive, much of the action; he is central to the opera's ending.  Rattle's Sportin' Life is Damon Evans, a classically trained singer whose range of venues has been enormous - including a stint as Lionel Jefferson in \\"The Jeffersons\\".  In the 1959 film, Sportin' Life was Sammy Davis Jr., the biggest talent in the show.  Davis' Sportin' Life wheedles and cajoles, a siren at the gates of Hel*.  Evans' Sportin' Life croons and beguiles, oiling the downhill slide.  It's hard to decide which of them is the greatest Tempter.  Both give fabulous performances.    (* \\"Hel\\" is the correct Nordic spelling.  The double \\"ll\\" is merely a Christian affectation.)    In Rattle's version. Crown is portrayed by Gregg Baker, a classically trained baritone who has appeared only twice on film.  His voice is clear and honest, and his acting is appropriately vigorous.  He makes an imposing and convincing Crown.  The 1959 Crown was Brock Peters, an actor with over a hundred film appearances to his name - in 1959 his only previous appearance had been in \\"Carmen Jones\\".  Baker is a more effective and menacing Crown, although Peters' performance is excellent.    I can't recommend this DVD too highly.  It's a tribute to Gershwin's genius and a genuinely involving performance.  As an added bonus, the English subtitles are the actual libretto!  And the good tunes never end.    An added bit oftrivia:  in 1959 2 uncredited bit parts were performed by Nichelle Nichols and Maya Angelou.

The story is captivating, characters are intriguing and dialogues are funny.  It's highly entertaining from cover to cover.

B0006GVJEE|4.0|This movie is definitely a classic.  It touches on the sadistic in a naive way and quite acceptable in Luc Besson's native French culture (according to his girlfriend anyway).  The only gripe I have is that like The Big Blue, I much prefer the edited version.  It's amazing how editors can get it so right.  A fabulous film - Gary Oldman is a master at his craft and I love Jean Reno as the emotionally immature 'cleaner'.  Natalie Portman in her first big role and its a tough role to follow.  Haven't seen her in a movie after this one where her talent is able to come to the fore as much as in this one.  One of the most noticeable exclusions in the bonus material is Luc Besson himself.  I also would have loved to see an interview with Gary Oldman and a feature on Eric Serra the composer.  The bonus material has made me want to check out La Femme Nikita where it all began.

Full of chracters that are complex and fascinating, and a journey that I couldn't even guess as to where it's heading, this is a wonderful first novel that feels like it's been written by someone who's been at the top of their genre for a long time.

Funny how during the bands heyday they released a terrible live album \\"Absolutely Live\\" and years later all this really good material finally sees the light of day. Highly recommended sampler if your not interested in the full set of the albums these performances are from as of now.<br />Search \\"Judemac Forever\\" on msn, Google or Yahoo.

B000F7OMZ2|4.0|The middle film in the original Indiana Jones trilogy is often seen as the weakest entry, and there is little to argue about that there.  The problem isn't that it is a poor film, but that its surrounding entries are fantastic, and looked at as two of some of the best movies of all time.  Both Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade succeed because not only does Indy go after some very interesting Biblical artifacts (The Ark and The Holy Grail), but he has to fight off a legion of Nazis in both films.  In Temple of Doom, Indy helps save a village from it's ruining fate in India by going after the Shankara Stones, stolen and held by a group known as the \\"Thugi\\" within Pancock Palace (spell?)  While the result is fun and indeed different than the other films, there is a noticable loss of plot excitement compared to Raiders and Crusade, along with other annoyances that keep this film below par compared to the others.<br /><br />Originality helps and hurts Temple.  As mentioned by many reviewers, the film is the darkest in the series, with scenes of sacrifice, children slaves, bug eating, and a scene of Mola Ram pulling out an innocent's heart.  The film is rated PG, but would definelty be PG-13 if it had been released after the PG-13 system came out a few years later.  The story isn't as interesting as Raiders and Last Crusade, but still remains interesting nonetheless, which gives the viewer much curiosity about this unusual religion that the Thugi practice.<br /><br />Indy's sidekick and girlfriend don't help much either.  Although Short Round has become an icon in the film over the years (one could argue), providing humor and lots of memorable one liners, he more or less drags pacing along, as well as Indy on his adventure.  Wily Scott is the most annoying girl of the 3 Indy films, and her acting isn't really all that teriffic, with her whining and complaining getting more on one's nerves than adding any humor which I belive to be the attempt.<br /><br />For some really good news, the action in Temple of Doom is incredible, and in my opinion some of the best of any Indy film.  The beginning of the film starts off with great pacing that never lets up until we reach the India village.  The scenes of sacrifice are highly entertaining, with crowds of Thugi cheering on to the beat of drums and Mola Ram holding the victim's burning heart in one hand while the victim is being lowered into a pit of fire (don't worry, it's actually more of a fun scene than disturbing).  But the most memorable scene is the mine cart chase that still looks impressive to date.  A fast and furious chase that seems to go on for quite a while, with unexpected and clever action along the way.  The film ends with the classic bridge scene, where Indy cuts the rope, splitting the bridge into two, high above a river of crocs.<br /><br />It's Indiana Jones, so in other words, its a great film.  The weakest and most annoying in the series, Temple of Doom still thrives off of originality and impressive action.  Despite the fact Ford's supporting actors are a little weak, he still gives us a great performance as always.<br /><br />[..]he action in Temple of Doom is incredible, and in my opinion some of the best of any Indy film.

B000W4KT6E|1.0|This would probably be a bright and entertaining musical if one of the lead characters was not so horribly miscast. The director of the original and much, much better 1988 'Hairspray,' John Waters, has a 15-second cameo as a flasher. If John Travolta's part had been confined to this time-span, then this film would be bearable. But no, Travolta plays the part of Tracy's mother, grimacing and staggering in a fatsuit through about 50% of the scenes, and flopping about like a beached, dying Orca in a climactic musical number.<br /><br />Just how bad is John Travolta here? Well, first I must certify that I am not a Travolta-hater. I have seen at least 4 John Travolta movies that I really liked, and I liked him back when he was a Sweathog as well.<br /><br />But here is how bad he is in 'Hairspray': Pluck-out-my-eyeballs, cauterize-my-optic -nerve, give-me-an-icepick-lobotomy, pump-me-full-of-thorazine bad. His Baltimore accent alone, one small portion of this grotesque performance, is easily the worst fake accent in movie history, surpassing Kevin Costner's atrocious Boston accent from 'Thirteen Days.' The U.S. of A. has literally millions of excellent overweight female impersonators who could have taken this role and made it Oscar-worthy. Kirstie Alley comes to mind immediately. But there are millions of other female impersonators who'd have been just as good if not better.<br /><br />By casting Travolta in this role, the implication is that female impersonation is not an art, but something any slob can just pick up in no time. You wouldn't even think of trying that with another art form, like Martial Arts for instance. Try replacing Jackie Chan with Nathan Lane, see how well that works. The casting of John Travolta has not only condemned this film to painful unwatchability, it is also an insult to every hard-working female impersonator in America.

B000P6YNSE|5.0|Season 3 started out with too many flashbacks and seemed to bog down at first and then... it took off with a bang and many plot twists and turns and surprises.
0920668372|5.0|I love this book.  It is a favorite of mine, my children, my mother, my sisters, my nieces...et cetera.  I could go on and on as to the sheer number of people that this book has touched.  It so perfectly illustrates the strength of love that a mother has for her child and how that love never lessens or dies, no matter how old or young her child.  It also shows that a mother's love can pass on for generations, teaching children to become loving parents themselves through the example of a loving, affectionate parent.    However, if you are expecting \\"realism\\" from this book, you need to look elsewhere.  I couldn't get over some of the negative reviews I've read of this book criticizing it for being \\"inappropriately unrealistic.\\"  This is a work of FICTION.  The author employs different literary techniques in order to help tell his story.  A few words and phrases the critics might want to familiar themselves with:  Allegory, Creative License and Symbolism, to name just a few.  If you don't like the book, you don't like the book.  No problem.   Different people have different likes and dislikes.  But to act like the author is demented and that anybody who likes his book is mentally/emotionally deficient as well is just incredibly ignorant.    I believe this is a book for readers who appreciate fairy tales and symbolism, readers who are parents themselves and/or those who have close relationships with their parents.  Clearly, there are those that may not be able to grasp the symbolism or the creative license the author uses...but as my own small children have never had trouble with it, I wonder if it isn't because some adults have become too literal-minded and have lost all ability to employ their own imaginations.
B00005BJ2O|3.0|I first bought Moulin Rouge 2 soundtrack because I wanted the songs from the movie w/ the actual singers.  But it sucked.... you get Ewan MacGregor singing with some unknown chic, or Nicole Kidman singing a remix with some random guy.  Remixes and different people.  Uggg.  I was looking to buy this CD because the track listing says that Nicole and Ewan actually sing *together* on it for a few songs, but apparently the songs are changed from the way they are in the movie??  This stinks!

B00000I5Y6|5.0|I first bought this album back when It was first released. Excellent complilation. I loved every song on here and eventually since then I went out and bought every CD. I even liked \\" Perfect Lover\\" and was disappointed that it was not included in the remaster. They could have included it and still included the three extra tracks. \\"Closet Chronicles\\" was an excellent choice to include as an extra track.
B000ICLRIE|4.0|The beauty of this Blu Ray disk left me breathless. Scott is a master behind the camera and this film is no exception. Nearly every scene could be a prize-winning still image (or classic painting.) The Director's Cut is far superior to the original version, in that it fills in many of the holes in the story line.    I consider this one of my all-time favorite films - IN SPITE of Scott's  ridiculous view of the crusades and the crusaders (many reviewers below fully agree with him, the poor misguided saps) without mentioning the atrocities commited by the Muslims here and in preceeding years. An uninformed person would come away thinking (as many have) \\"Those terrible Christian crusaders. Why would they attack those wonderful, innocent, Muslims.\\"
B000002GK1|5.0|I rarely hear a group as truthful as their name and this is one album that is the most exemplary.  From beginning to end if you can adjust your equalizer some how and amplify the lows on your stereo you will begin to learn why they are called Soungarden.  To me one of the first groups along with Quicksand that really attack sound.  To me a door a thousand years wide is a good redo of one of Bob Lind's songs and really puts a stamp on things.  The most expressive vocals I have heard on any album consistently throughout an album.  The drums in jesus christ pose are nothing short of mindbending along with the awesome riffs in the song.  This group has a lot of firsts in my opinion and is why I give it 5 stars.  I have never heard anything close to this sound in this time period nor hardly ever since, just mimicks.

B000002B5L|5.0|I first heard the video to fugeela with their safari outfits on and everything and really liked it so I bought the album and immediately said there are some good songs.  Did not completely understand the album at the time and now listening to it, as I have aged, sounds much better and means much more to me when listening to it. The bass in the tracks are hard to beat with three mixes of fugeela to satisfy your contrast needs.  I like the redo of music by the musicians in the group and the sample of Enya's boadicea.  This album does stand the test of time in my opinion and pushes the envelope of sound quite a bit so I give it 5 stars.
B000SNUMC0|5.0|I agree with everyone else that gave it 5 stars.  One of, if not the best IE album ever.  Listen to it in track order and all the way through.  It is soooo well written.  You will get lost in it.  Tim Owens vocals are flat out amazing and the songs show his vocal talents off without being in your face.    I am hoping to see them at Chicago Powerfest.
B00005UK1F|3.0|I got the album in 2004-05 and really enjoyed the atmosphere of the album the string arrangements and the countermeasured bursts of electric guitar solos and long drawn out riff playing--they compliment each other nicely. I liked the sax solo and the strange organshperes thrown in.  What I did not like about the album was that when as soon as I hear the voice singing it does not compliment the atmosphere they have built up before the singing(only in the first beginning vocals) .  In the world of music I give it three stars since it is noteworthy.  It pushes the envelope of sound in some areas of grouping organs, metal, acoustics but not as pushing the envelope as in rap, hip-hop mixing and mastering; they could have added some kind of real good atmospheric basslines but it lacks that perspective in this album.  It is 3.5 stars in my honest opinion but give it 3 because I cannot stand having no breaks in the song--they could have done like dj mixers do and break the mix so to speak, but one long song is too long at an hour without breaks. So I give one star for each in: acoustic, metal, organ atmosphere-- the singing is average the lyrics are noteworthy.

B000Y7U98C|1.0|This big-budget catastrophe (pun intended) illustrates how easily a movie can go totally wrong.  I was willing to suspend disbelief: the sun is losing power. We can restore it by re-igniting it with nukes! Clever, until one realizes the sun IS nukes.  What to do? Take the stupidest, least motivated crew you can possibly find, people who are telling us \\"human life SHOULD be extinguished\\" by their actions and lack of motivation and give them the mission of saving planet Earth. The film begins on the ship; no hint of what informed this rash decision.  But wait! It gets better: instead of a straight journey to the center of the solar system, throw in mutated earlier solarnauts, and change the entire focus of the film from a disaster movie to a slasher movie (Def.: a slasher movie is one in which the characters are killed off, one at a time). Although we watched this to the end (we love planetary disaster films), this was a real strain to accomplish.
B000J103PC|5.0|Far more than just a humorous take on the fashion industry, a mere 40 minutes into the story, we begin developing deep connections and storylines.  Amidst the office humor, we are introduced to the complexity of balancing career aspirations, intimate relationships and personal development.  Pretty heavy stuff for what I presumed was a light breezy film.<br /><br />The story follows Andrea (known to friends as \\"Andy\\" - and played by Anne Hathaway) after she accepts a job as 2nd assistant to the \\"Devil\\" Miranda - played flawlessly by Meryl Streep.  Think of Miranda as a real life Leona Helmsley, someone I personally admired.  A woman with passion for excellence and a sharp (often misconstrued as b*itchy) attitude.  Andrea develops in her new career, and agrees to \\"serve\\" one year, if she can \\"s*ck it up\\".  Her career attitude affects her personal one, and her long-term relationship with her boyfriend and close circle of friends suffers.  In the meantime, her career advances, and she is also pursued by a man of the business, who wants more than just her business assets.<br /><br />As the film draws to an end, Andrea realizes the person she \\"truly\\" is, and makes decisions that will affect her career, and her relationships.  Some of which comes too late.<br /><br />While this review makes the movie out to be more of a drama than a comedy, there are ample laughs throughout the film.  But unlike strict comedy's, this one has several serious moments, especially in the second half.  Well worth viewing.  Great on a cold winter night, or rainy summer evening.  Or just anytime you need something on the light side with an ample amount of drama spliced in.<br /><br />This was a solid 4, but I gave it a 5, because I would watch it again (and I rarely watch movies twice).  I found the deeper side of the story made this film rare in it's category.  Without it, it would have been \\"just another\\" 3-star film (maybe 4).
B00104QSOM|5.0|This movie has the best acting, best music and best feeling throughout it. This is not a movie that moves fast, so don't watch it if you can't handle slow movies. But it it one of the best experiences, movie wise, you'll ever have. A perfect movie
B0010358D0|4.0|One of the more underdeveloped storylines from \\"Appleseed\\" was the relationship between Deunan Knute and her cyborg love, Briareos.<br /><br />Well, \\"Appleseed Ex Machina\\" more than makes up for that. In fact, this CGI action flick boasts upgrades in every area -- a tighter plot, more complex conspiracies, and more lifelike animation. It's a stunning experience with loads of fiery, spinning action scenes, albeit with a slightly improbable villain.<br /><br />Olympus has a new threat -- brainwashed cyborgs that are kidnapping officials, and disrupting planetary peace. During a rescue mission, Briareos is injured and hospitalized for awhile -- and Deunan introduced to her new partner Tereus -- a warrior bioroid cloned from Briareos' DNA.  She's furious, Briareos is depressed, and all three are confused by Tereus' similarities to Briareos.<br /><br />But when President Athena calls an international conference, E-SWAT only narrowly stops an attack force -- of cyborgs and ordinary humans who have somehow been possessed by a mechanical goo. Their message: \\"I am Halcon... all will be one.\\" And worst of all, Briareos is somehow being affected by the baddies, so he decides to do some investigating on his own. Now Deunan, Briareos and Tereus must join forces despite their tension, and stop a malevolent conspiracy that threatens the entire world....<br /><br />While the first \\"Appleseed\\" movie had a rather simple plot, \\"Appleseed Ex Machina\\" tends toward complexity. Everything is bigger -- the conspiracies, the mad scientist stuff, the potential warfare, and even the love story. And despite its fuller plot, the sequel actually manages to cram in some quiet moments between robot battles and personal scuffles.<br /><br />Director Shinji Aramaki does a pretty good job with a pretty good plot -- he unrolls it gradually, filling it with tension and horror at all the right moments. It kicks off strongly with an explosive, fire-and-darkness battle in an abandoned cathedral, and doesn't slow much down. Lots of explosive battles and zombiesque attacks, but not so many that it overwhelms the storyline.<br /><br />Along the way, Aramaki drops in some very \\"human\\" scenes, such as a funeral and Hitomi's glammy birthday party. In fact, there are even some funny, cute moments such as Briareos and Deunan tussling over some monitoring wires in the hospital. These moments keep them acting like people.<br /><br />What's the problem? Well, while Aramaki succeeds in surprising us with the main villain, it's revealed rather late in the movie, and there's never much of a motive.<br /><br />But the CG animation is stunning. There's everything from mid-air shootouts to serpentine silver tentacles. Even the settlings are striking, with their Greco-futuristic marble, columns and sci-fi gadgets. And there's a breathtaking level of detail -- reflections, light, raindrops on Briareos' metal face, and tiny facial chances. Some character still have \\"doll face,\\" but not as much.<br /><br />But this movie gets its heart from the love triangle, which is thankfully handled in a mature manner. Deunan and Briareos' loving, intense relationship gets plenty of cute moments, despite the confusion that Tereus causes them. And Tereus is a well-drawn rival, with a lot of Briareos' rough kindness, but also the insecurities of being a \\"copy.\\"<br /><br />And Aramaki particularly concentrates on Briareos' fears that Deunan will prefer a flesh-and-blood lover, and that he is gradually losing his sanity. There's an undercurrent of raw pain when he screams at Tereus, \\"why do you have everything I've lost?\\"<br /><br />\\"Appleseed Ex Machina\\" is a worthy sequel that actually tops the preceding film -- a stunning CGI shell around a solid sci-fi/love story.

0321544080|4.0|I got this book because I had heard so many good reviews and opinions on it at strobist.com.   For people like me, a hobbyist photographer, this really gives tons of new ideas and tricks. I like it how McNally very clearly explains what problems he was faced with when shooting each picture, and how he managed to solve those. You learn that it is not always very high-tech stuff that seals the deal.    The other big thing for me in this book is to get an inside view to the life of a professional shooter. You get so much info from \\"between the lines\\". I have read magazines and newspapers for ages but now I will look at each picture with a different view. For example, wonder what kind of picture or mood the editor was looking for, why this particular picture was chosen for this paper, etc    Highly recommended!  Tommi
B0009MAO46|5.0|I think Toy Story is very awesome and it is even better than the 2nd film even though it was great too. This film originally came out in November 1995, Pixar's first studio film and I could remember it in the theater. In this film, Rex is the BEST. The best chapter of this film is the moving truck chase near the end of the film. Not one moment of this movie is boring. This movie is very exciting and I watch this a lot, get the second film too.
B00005QG9J|5.0|One could effectively make a case either for or against Incubus. I know this because I'm currently torn over them. Back in High School, they were my favorite band. Since their 2004 album, A Crow Left of the Murder, I've steadily grown out of love with them. Brandon Boyd is truly unparalleled as a rock vocalist, though as a lyricist he's sometimes laughably flawed. Likewise, Mike Einziger often wavers between guitar god and spirited amateur. Incubus has their moments on every album where they simply blow you away, and for that, they deserved to be listened to. It is Morning View, however, that remains their most impressive LP to date! It varies between loud, distorted, rock jams and introspective ballads, but does so effortlessly and sometimes unnoticably.<br /><br />Morning View's cover depicts a picturesque California coast; a peaceful, secluded patch of beach. The brilliant thing about the album is that every song, regardless of style, feels like if would be a perfect accompaniment to such a place. The album's first single, \\"Wish You Were Here\\" makes you want to close your eyes and picture yourself on that distant coast; the wind ripping through your hair, and your arms outstretched in a \\"With Arms Wide Open\\" music video type of way. If you could put music on a postcard with the phrase \\"Wish You Were Here,\\" this would be it! Boyd's lyrics beautifully capture this moment as well, singing, \\"I lean against the wind, pretend that I am weightless, and in this moment I am happy.\\"<br /><br />But Morning View is not all pretty, happy moments. Songs like \\"Mexico,\\" or the beautiful, \\"11am\\" drip with regret and remorse. Boyd softly sings, \\"7am. The garbage truck beeps as it backs up and I start my day thinking about what I've thrown away,\\" and you can immediately empathize with him. Both songs have a very somber, slow tone to them and brilliantly counter the intensity of the album's opening moments. Others such as \\"Blood on the Ground\\" or \\"Under My Umbrella\\" feature a defiant sound, more in line with the band's earlier funk-punk influenced albums.<br /><br />But more often than not, the tone of Morning View is one that is rather complacent. \\"Are You In?\\" is such a blissful, jazzy song that it's hard not to fall in love with it. Brandon Boyd sings in a carefree falsetto throughout a large portion of the song, noting that \\"It's so much better when sea foam green is in fashion,\\" which is dumb, yes, but also strangely satisfying. \\"Just a Phase\\" features similar lyrical blunders but finds the band experimenting with different sounds and using silence to effectively heighten a moment of increased volume in a way that I've yet to hear done quite so convincingly. And then there's always the zen-like experience that is listening to \\"Aqueous Transmission,\\" the album's peaceful closer. At over 7 minutes long, it takes the listener on a journey. Again, Boyd paints a beautiful picture that is brilliantly conveyed with the music. He sings, \\"I'm floating down a river...Lying face up on the floor of my vessel, I marvel at the stars and feel my heart overflow.\\" Sounds of crickets, frogs, and other noisy creatures add ambiance to an already surreal track. Such a song could only appear on this album, and Incubus has never really made a song that rivals this one.<br /><br />It has been over 6 years since Morning View first released. A lot has changed since then. Music has come and gone, and my tastes have changed significantly. The constant throughout all of that has been this one album. I can listen to it today just as I did 6 years ago; blaring through my speakers, me singing at the top of my lungs, air drumming, guitaring, etc. It is my go-to album for karaoke, a mainstream rock must-own, and by far Incubus' most solid and impressive peace of work. If you've yet to hear Morning View (who are you?), or would like to get reacquainted with it, I highly recommend giving it a listen. It has not disappointed me yet after (literally) hundreds of listens. Havefun with it!<br /><br />Key Tracks:<br />1. \\"Circles\\"<br />2. \\"Just a Phase\\"<br />3. \\"11am\\"<br />4. \\"Under My Umbrella\\"<br />5. \\"Aqueous Transmission\\"<br /><br />9 out of 10 Stars\\"Circles\\"  2. \\"Just a Phase\\"  3. \\"11am\\"  4. \\"Under My Umbrella\\"  5. \\"Aqueous Transmission\\"    9 out of 10 Stars
B00000J7SS|5.0|I think that B*tches Brew is one of Miles Davis' greatest recordings and this is as brilliant as In A Silent Way and is one of my favorite albums in the world. On this 2-disc album there are some of the longest songs I've ever heard like Pharaoh's Dance and the amazing title track. This music makes me want to relax in my bedroom and listen to this. Just close your eyes and let this album take you on a good journey through the world. This music also changed the world too. This album is highly recommended should be in every music collection.
