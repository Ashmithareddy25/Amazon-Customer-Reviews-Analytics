B0060Q962Q|5.0|Graphics are great on this update of a classic game. Easy to play and worked great on my EVO 3D and Galaxy Tab. And properly priced at a dollar.

B004T2QZL8|1.0|I have an EVO 3D and I usually (errrr... never) have this problem with other games, but it just keeps force-closing to the point that I'm not interested in it anymore. I've read other reviews where they are having the same problem on the EVO 3D.
0143119680|4.0|This is a well written fantasy novel with romance and history thrown in.  Interesting take on witches and vampires, with demons thrown in for good measure.  I don't understand the criticisms, when you read the title you understand it is not going to be Tolstoy, but it so much better than Harry Potter or the other vampire novels.  I think she is a wonderful writer of this genre and I liked the story.  I cannot wait for 15th Century England and I am looking forward to the next book.  She does lots of research and it is obvious in this book.
B006ZZC3D6|5.0|All good things. It is a mind teaser and a very beautiful, colorful game. I had a lot of fun trying to figure out how to beat each level. The gameplay is simple and the tutorial takes less than a minute to get through. So basic you'll be playing before you know it. As you advance the puzzles get harder and harder.<br /><br />I didn't see it ask for feint. They must have removed it. If so, /cheer!
0345803485|5.0|I was a little skeptical at first hearing all the excitement about these books, but boy was I wrong. Yes, there are some erotic scenes in the book, and people seem to freak out about that, but it is not by any means the most important part of the book. The books have a great story line and you fall in love with the characters. I recommend the book to all of my friends and it was so good and such an easy read.
B001PPLJIQ|5.0|The heartbreaking bittersweet love story of a 15 year old boy named Michael Berg (played at different ages by Ralph Fiennes and David Kross),who has a romance with a 36 year old woman and eventually falls in love with her. After their lovemaking he reads many of the classics to her (this affair goes on for months) and that's where we get the title for this film.<br /><br />But she strangely disappears on him (he shows up to an empty apartment) and with his broken heart he finds it hard to relate to women his age. More time passes and he's in law school and he's at the hearings in the 1960s for Nazi War criminals and his ex lover is there and taking the heat at the expense of the accused female group (they were female guards who kept Jewish prisoners in a burning church during a death march because they were told to not let them escape). She goes to prison for a very long time but Michael keeps in contact with her. What follows is his long correspondence over the years and arguably at the expense of his extended family. It's poignant at times when his mother complains about him never coming to visit much in his hometown or even flying back for his father's funeral (he's in New York City). But what his mother doesn't realize is that the memories of his lost love are too painful to revisit. One wonders if his broken heart resulted in his eventual divorce from a wife that doesn't appear on the screen but is only mentioned.<br /><br />** MINOR SPOILER **<br /><br />At the original hearing he learns that she doesn't know how to read so she couldn't have been mainly responsible for issuing orders to let the prisoners burn in the building. Hanna would rather go to prison for most of her life than admit she cannot read. Michael realizes this during the trial as he flashbacks to all the times he read to her and the moments in which she looked at his books but didn't fully comprehend them.<br /><br />So what follows is him sending her tape recordings (this is before DVDs and all that other tech that we love) teaching her how to read and enunciate words. His former lover's world opens to the world of reading. She writes back to him with simple letters but he never responds and instead keeps sending tapes to her. In a way you get that this is therapeutic for Michael, who is still dealing with the pain of their break up so many years later.<br /><br />Michael in later years has to make a choice. The prison calls him to tell him that Hanna is soon to be released and he's the only person listed as somebody who knows her. After a lot of angst Michael decides to meet her and see if a relationship so many years later is possible but tragedy is at the door. There's a nice book ending to this tale in which Michael couldn't tell his mother about his love affair but he does get to tell his daughter during the closing credits.<br /><br />** END SPOILERS **<br /><br />The best part of this film are the many layered themes interwoven with personal emotions. Can movies and literature truly convey the horrors of the Holocaust or is it something one had to live through to fully understand? Are we wasting time trying to convey the horrors to later generations which have mixed feelings about it? Can a boy truly be in love with an older woman or is it pedophilia? Why does a younger man in love with a far older woman bother us as a society yet the reverse is fine? Can literature be used to convey feelings that cannot be expressed in words? Can literature be used to fill in the empty space of silence between two people? How can people do absolutely horrible things and then go on living a normal life as if nothing had happened? How does a country deal with a generation of its people that did horrible things and even tried to justify their actions? Can one be forgiven for doing horrible things? Who decides what can and cannot be forgiven?<br /><br />Kate Winslet, who plays the older woman, Hanna, would garner an Oscar (Best Actress) as well as a Golden Globe award for her superlative performance as a cold yet strangely sympathetic and compelling Nazi war criminal. Not surprisingly this film was nominated for a host of other awards, including the coveted Best Picture. Based on a novel of a similar title by Bernhard Schlink who was an advisor on the film.<br /><br />The budget was $32M and it made over $108M at the Box Office. Arguably one of the top ten movies for 2008 if you want more than explosions and cute but empty lines in your dialogue.<br /><br />STORY/PLOTTING: A minus to A; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: A; CINEMATOGRAPHY: B plus to A minus; THEMES/QUESTIONS: A minus; WHEN WATCHED: December 2011; OVERALL GRADE: A minus to A.<br /><br />BEST DIALOGUE (possible spoilers): Michael: I can't live without you. The thought of leaving you kills me. Do you love me?  //// Hanna Schmitz: It doesn't matter what I feel. It doesn't matter what I think. The dead are still dead.  /// Young Ilana Mather: [Testifying in court] Each of the guards would choose a certain number of women. Hanna Schmitz chose differently. Judge: In what way differently?  Young Ilana Mather: She had favourites. Girls, mostly young. We all remarked on it, she gave them food and places to sleep. In the evening, she asked them to join her. We all thought - well, you can imagine what we thought. Then we found out - she was making these women read aloud to her. They were reading to her. At first we thought this guard... this guard is more sensitive... she's more human... she's kinder. Often she chose the weak, the sick, she picked them out, she seemed to be protecting them almost. But then she dispatched them. Is that kinder?  //// Rose Mather: People ask all the time what I learned in the camps. But the camps weren't therapy. What do you think these places were? Universities? We didn't go there to learn. One becomes very clear about these things. What are you asking for? Forgiveness for her? Or do you just want to feel better yourself? My advice, go to the theatre, ifyou want catharsis. Please. Go to literature. Don't go to the camps. Nothing comes out of the camps. Nothing.  //// Professor Rohl: Societies think they operate by something called morality, but they don't. They operate by something called law. Professor Rohl: 8000 people worked at Auschwitz. Precisely 19 have been convicted, and only 6 of murder. Professor Rohl: The question is never \\"Was it wrong\\", but \\"Was it legal\\". And not by our laws, no. By the laws at the time.

B007549W62|1.0|Warning:  this review contains spoilers, don't read it if you want to be surprised by the ending.  OK, this movie has a strong cast, and adequate directing, my beef is with the story itself.  Watching humans devolve in stressful situations is interesting, gritty, and makes for a long lasting impression.  These kinds of movies make for supremely interesting water cooler talk.  See \\"Blindness\\" (based on the Nobel prize winning novel) for an excellent example.  The problem with this movie is inescapable plot holes and a horribly sad and depressing ending.  Two successful film making rules the makers of this film should have followed are:<br />1. If it doesn't add anything to the story and creates confusion and questions for the audience; don't put it in the film.  In this case some specially suited humans show up partway through the movie; obviously spending considerable cost and effort to first infiltrate and then lock in the survivors.  Why?  To what end?  They are never explained and serve no purpose in the film.<br />2. The ending has to have some shred of joy, hope, happiness or closure - this movie has none.  The heroin goes through increasingly painful struggles to stay alive to simply die a lonely and hopeless death without any explanation or closure ... the movie just abruptly ends without telling the whole tale.
B005MIYIB2|1.0|This cd is so different from their other work that they should not be calling themselves Nightwish. It doesn't even sound like rock anymore. It's alternative at best.<br /><br />As far as I'm concerned, we need to sing Bye Bye Beautiful to the band, because they're not Nightwish anymore.
B0086700CM|5.0|I personally love this game. I used to play it on all my friends ipod touchs but now its out for kindle fire. Yes!!! And to all those haters that wrote mean comments about this game, first of all this game does not get bpring unless you are impatient. second of all you have to unlock different powers and people once you collect more coins as you go farther. and last of all please dont use cuss words in your reviews because there is no parental lock for that.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love teen fantasy fiction but only get to read it a few time a year.  This book was awesome.  I won't summarize as there are many reviews to do that.  But the action, attention to detail, and fantastical characters allowed me to lose myself.  Will read the next book in this series.  I saw the movie and it was great, but the book tops it.
B003VPWXRO|5.0|I have been waiting to get my hands on this book. I was truly not disappointed & it gave me the motivation to be who I am, without having to prove oneself to others.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|not too bad. some are pretty hard though. nice to kill time with. I like that there are so many to choose from
B0086700CM|1.0|I don't see how this is so popular. Very boring, repetitive, and it feels pointless.  Tried it a few times over a few days to see if it just needed to grow on me... it didn't.
B00802JMPO|3.0|Thought I would get a little crazy on this trilogy set and read them in random order, you know to really spice things up a bit. Well I started with book 3, then went to 1 and finished it up with 2. I think that the author should probably give a little back story in book 3, you know so people who didn't read the first two will know what's going on. This would probably have to be said about most trilogies, except for Back to the Future, I mean you can watch the 3rd movie of that one and it wouldn't matter if you saw the first two or not, I mean what was Marty Mcfly thinking when he wrote those stories?<br /><br />But I digress, back to the trilogy at hand, I was very excited to order this book when I heard what it was about, I was however, very disappointed when I found that there were no pictures in the book. Who writes a book about sexual encounters and has no pictures to back it up? How are we suppose to believe these things even happened? This is similar to another book I recently ordered, Moneyball, starring Brad Pitt. That book also didn't have any pictures in it of Brad, why even have him play the main character if you aren't going to use his \\"moneymaker\\" for any pictures? We all saw what happened with that too, didn't win an Oscar for Best Screen Play Adaptation and poor Bradgalina was left in the dust when nominated for Best Actor. And don't get me started on Jonah Hill, his days are over, no one's going to think a skinny kid is funny. He should have just went \\"Chris Farley\\" on us after Superbad.<br /><br />I'm giving this trilogy 3 stars simply because each book deserves one.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this is a great game to play with my grandson .  he liked playing the original Oregon trail so I thought he would like this one too and he does. I love the graphics. too

0425263908|1.0|This book is FIFTY SHADES OF GREY, but not nearly as well done... she even copies the color of the primary characters eyes, the silver tie and possessiveness of the male lead character... I read this book directly after the Fifty Shades Trilogy and was extremely disappointed.  EL James did an amazing job with Fifty and if you're a fan of her work, don't read this book... it will just piss you off!
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Great game. Lots of fun. Lots of levels. I Would have bought if it wasn't free app of the day.
1466401885|3.0|This review is probably going to be all over the place, but this is what I felt.  I bought this book because of the high rating and first dozen or so reviews I read.  I have to say it had potential, but half way through, it really started to fill me with meh.  Travis was a good, strong character off the bat, but as the pages turned, his vices became more and more annoying, and so did his pleading.  For me, this \\"top dog\\" quickly changed to \\"hot headed, silly boyfriend\\".  Pay attention to the title, when the main characters went down a road that was silly, i had to remind myself that they are meant to have problems. it's essentially about a destructive relationship.  two people who really should not be together.  I didn't find the heroine to be particularly compelling, and although she had an interesting back story, her bad girl self took her down a notch or two.  Not too many intimate moments, the only one that really stands out in my mind as causing an emotional stir was their first naughty encounter.  In the end i finished the book, and it was OK.  but it's not one that will stay with me.  I think it would have been a better read if it was told from Travis' point of view.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|This game was so damn fun BUT since J.Lo and Enrique got thrown in the mix I've been irritated... their ad takes even longer than the others!!!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I have to admit, like everyone else here, I was intrigued. However, I write for a living and this is nothing but poorly written fanfiction from a trilogy that seems Shakespearean in comparison (that would be Twilight).<br /><br />The geography mistakes, the British English (because Yanks don't talk that way), the bad sex scenes...I could go on but I won't. I am going to take a page out of my daughter's vocabulary and call this one an epic fail.<br /><br />Seriously, and this is a number one best seller and has been for weeks? [[ASIN:0060746394 Nine and a Half Weeks: A Memoir of a Love Affair]], [[ASIN:1562010352 Story of O]]...now, those are steamy books...this is just a pathetic excuse for a fantasy written either by a teenager or a middle-aged woman who thinks this is what women want.<br /><br />Well, it has been on the charts for weeks so I guess this is what women and men want...I'm going to stop reading now because every minute with this book makes me feel like I am turning into an [[ASIN:B0011Z10Y8 American Idiot (Album Version) [Explicit]]]. ;-/
B004EBUXSA|5.0|This is the first standalone processor I've ever bought and I haven't tried overclocking before.<br /><br />That being said, I consider myself a power computer user. When I built a computer from scratch earlier this year, I knew I wanted the best parts. Using this processor is like putting a V10 engine in your car, with the limiter removed.<br /><br />In 6 months, I have not been able to stress this thing out! Here are some programs I've used on high performance settings, often more than one at once: Photoshop CS5, Illustrator CS3, Crysis, The Witcher II, iTunes, Chrome, Firefox, Vuze, Microsoft Office, Audacity, Minecraft (highest settings + super texture packs). Nothing slows this beast down. All of this is at stock clock speed (3.4 GHz). If and when I feel that I need extra juice, I know I can pretty safely push it to ~4.5GHz or higher. Honestly though, you probably won't need that much power. The only way I could see you topping this sucker out is if you're doing heavy video editing, 3d model rendering, and extremely processor intensive tasks (e.g., phylogenetic analysis) all at the same time (or maybe running >5 virtual machines).<br /><br />Power consumption and heat production are fine at factory clock speeds. Before you overclock, do your homework to make sure you don't fry your motherboard. I never hear the CPU fans, which indicates that it doesn't run super hot. My GPU fans far exceed how much noise is made by anything else in my computer, and if you're a power user, that's probably the biggest noise factor to consider.<br /><br />Also make sure you get an appropriate motherboard. This is a fairly new processor that uses a new socket. I went for the [[ASIN:B004QF0VEK ASUS P8P67-M PRO <REV 3.0> LGA 1155 SATA 6Gbps and USB 3.0 Supported Intel P67 DDR3 2200 Micro ATX Motherboard]]. It's a pretty good motherboard, but if you go for that one in particular, ensure your computer case is an appropriate size. It's pretty big.<br /><br />All in all, I'm extremely satisfied. If you're at all curious about overclocking, I recommend this model over the 2500. Both are likely more power than you'll ever need, though.
B00845PV16|3.0|My thoughts on this video are that it's not as bad as some of the scathing critiques I've read on Amazon thus far.  But there is some truth to the negative reviews. This is not a movie I would describe as \\"good.\\" It's more along the \\"okay\\" range. I rented it when I was home and wanted only to watch a movie and surf the web. So I got Ghost Rider II and did just that. The acting is generally decent, although Cage is probably the worst in this film - as far as acting goes. But it's based off of a comic book (and a marginally popular character, at that), so my expectations aren't really high. This movie is a decent watch, so long as you keep your perspective. It's got fire, action, fighting, and a steady pace. Is the story line well thought-out? Nope. I agree with another reviewer who said this is Marvel's worst movie product so far; they could've done better. But still, it's not a waste of time either. I'm not someone who'll continue watching a bad movie. I just turn them off and would rather waste the rental money than continue to waste time after having already wasted the money. This movie, I watched until the end. I actually didn't rent this particular movie from Amazon, so I'm on the fence about whether it's worth 4 dollars. Maybe if you just had the urge to see it and it was last on your list of rentals - then it'd be worth $4. Otherwise, check out John Carter or Sherlock Holmes or Safe House. Then come back for Ghost Rider. It's  not bad. But it's not good either. Just okay.
B00402FGE4|5.0|I have to admit, the basic plot of the show drove me away from it for a good while before Netflix got it, I was done with the other two Stargates, and I did not have any other Stargate to turn to. I sat through the first episode and felt like I just could not watch only one. Before I knew it, I was finishing episode 20 of the second season and, starving for more, I rampaged through google's pages only to find it cancelled and scrapped. The whole show triggers my scientific and religious curiosities, in equal measure, and leave me with nothing but respect for the creativity of the writers of the show. Stargate Universe is one of the most mature Stargates and is by far one of the most creative and mind-blowing. This series was murdered before it could fully mature, but even in its youth, it is one of my favorite shows of all time.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I was never a big reader but I loved game of thrones. I wanted to read the book before seeing the show and was so glad I did. If you even remotely think you might be into game of thrones, I would recommend reading this
B005LAIHR2|2.0|The popular stage musical \\"Rock of Ages\\" is not fantastic by any means, but it is quite entertaining and the actors do well enough in their respective roles (and can actually sing well).  When I heard the musical was being adapted to the big screen I decided to check the movie out.  There have been terrific adaptations (\\"Chicago\\") and a few good ones (\\"Rent\\", \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\").  However \\"Rock of Ages\\" does not fall into either category.<br /><br />One of the appealing points of the musical is that it does not take itself very seriously.  The problem with the film adaptation is it does take itself seriously and that takes away from the enjoyment of the film.  It in fact kills the enjoyment pretty much on its own.<br /><br />In adaptations we inevitably see changes made from the source material.  A great example of that is the 1978 film adaptation of \\"Grease\\" which could not be more different from the musical.  However changes can work as they did with \\"Grease\\".  Not so much with \\"Rock of Ages\\".  A few characters who I enjoyed in the musical are not featured in the movie and are replaced by formulaic cliches that could not be more of a contrivance if you tried.  The villain of the musical is a German construction tycoon who is hell bent on tearing down The Burbon Room and it's surroundings for a new development much to the disdain of the tycoon's son.  In the movie these characters are removed and replaced by the Mayor of Hollywood (Bryan Cranston) and his nutcase wife (Academy Award winner Catherine Zeta-Jones.).  Both of these characters are just plan dull and loaded with formulaic plot devices (The husband is unfaithful.  The wife has a secret for her anger and hatred of \\"The Devil's Music\\".  Give me a break.).  The main characters of Sherrie and Diego have no chemistry whatsoever.  Alec Baldwin tries his best as Burbon Room owner Dennis Dupree, but I would not have cast him.  Speaking of cliches, Paul Giamatti's character of the manager who cares nothingabout his clients and just cares about himself and money is something we have all seen many times over.<br /><br />This review would not be complete without mentioning Tom Cruise as Stacee Jaxx.  The character had a very small part in the stage musical.  Here he is the center of the entire movie.  I wish the writers stuck with the musical's treatment of the character.  In the play Jaxx is a slimeball who's antics finally catch up with him in the end (and rightfully so).  In the movie he is played as a poor misguided soul who does not mean to be a dirtbag, he just turned out that way because of his evil manager.  I think this was done because we have to make poster boy Tom Cruise look good so the ladies will flock to see the movie.  This is too bad because Cruise has shown he can play the bad guy and play the part well as he did in 2004's \\"Collateral\\" (Which earned him his third Oscar nomination.)  Also, I would love to know why he whispers all his dialogue.  In all fairness he does a desent job of singing the only Bon Jovi song I can tolerate \\"Wanted Dead or Alive.\\"<br /><br />I would recommend you skip this movie and catch the musical instead.  The musical is not perfect by any means but it's a lot better than this misfire.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|With every book, the suspense builds. This book was a lot more different from the other two. Because THIS book doesn't totally revolve around the Games. It more focuses on how Katniss handles the rebellion and regaining peace in Panem. The twist when they get Peeta back is remarkable and you'd otherwise never see it coming.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins never fails to succeed in bringing elements of suspense and love triangles and violence into the book. The elements I so greatly crave. I love how, even in a life or death themed book, Collins always manages to keep the love triangle between Katniss, Peeta, and Gale threaded throughout the trilogy.<br /><br />She always introduces characters well. How in the first book, she says, &#34;…this strategy worked well for Johanna Mason…&#34; and then she becomes a main character. Same with Delly Cartwright. Except, her time in the books didn't last as long.<br /><br />While the story is really a metaphor for what can happen if the government gets to powerful, etcetera, etcetera, she plays this off so well, that you really enjoy it.<br /><br />Five stars for Suzanne Collins' Hunger Games trilogy!

1439127700|5.0|After living through the presidencies since World War II which Gibbs and Duffy describe, the most surprising thing about this book are the many details I never knew. The President's Club has certain informal rules about how they relate to each other, provide assistance to the incumbent, and respect the difficult decisions only the president can make. Descriptions of positive assistance such as Hoover's tremenduous contributions in feeding Europe after WWII reflect distinct reassurance of that great men can cooperate across party lines. But there are also disturbing disclosures such as Eisenhower, after bragging about keeping the country out of war during his administration, in phone conversations urging Johnson to escalate military force in Vietnam. Of course, we all know about Watergate, but how many of us knew that Nixon sabatoged peace negotiations in October 1968 for fear Johnson would receive credit and Humprey would be elected -- only to settle for similar terms four years and many American deaths later.<br /><br />Most readers who follow current events are well aware of George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton's cooperative international disaster relief work, but the authors describe the depth of their subsequent friendship in a manner that leaves this cynic hopeful that if ex-presidents can work effectively together to solve massive problems, perhaps some courageous current politicians will follow their example.<br /><br />From start to finish this is a good read -- fascinating insider details, a unique perspective on history, and straight forward analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the men who have held the highest office in the country.

I wouldn't call it a quick process, but it was methodical and understandable.<br />The reason I'm only giving three stars is that I didn't see enough radical improvement in display to justify the retail price of the product (I may have received via vine program but I review as if I had paid what everyone else will for the product).<br />At $100 I would have given it 4-1/2 stars.<br />Your mileage may vary...
B0058YPG1G|1.0|I waited months for this to arrive only to find that there are no English subtitles.  French?, Spanish, no problemo.  English?  No wayo...  However, if you were smart enough to go blu-ray, you would get English.<br />Frankly, I would love to just ship it back.  For those of us who blew out our hearing listening to rock and roll, subtitles are critical.
B007P6VLRS|4.0|This is a very difficult review to write. I've loved the Pumpkins like many others since their Siamese/Mellon Collie Days. Unlike many others though, I've never been disappointed by any of Billy Corgan's work. I even liked Zeitgeist quite a bit, and still think the song \\"Tarantula\\" is an underappreciated gem.<br /><br />Oceania begins with sheer pleasure as \\"Quasar\\" is an incredibly good tune, playing like a throwback to their earlier work. The album is solid until the middle, meandering section of the title track and others. It picks up steam again towards the end. The rocker tracks are definitely the best parts of the album, in my opinion. What makes this a challenging listen though is the absence of hooks in the choruses and guitar riffs. That's strange for a Smashing Pumpkins album. But it keeps me going back for more, because I want to delve deeper into the songs and enjoy the sonic musical craftsmanship. And Corgan has found worthy counterparts to give a complete band sound.<br /><br />This is a beautiful album filled with lush audio. Definitely worth having.
B004XN3FHA|4.0|I tracked this light for a while and bought it when it was on sale for a great price.  I own a couple of the smaller Fenix lights (E20 - 109 lumens and LD20 - 180 lumens) so I had high expectations for this light.  It is brighter than my smaller lights, but it definitely doesn't seem 8 times brighter than my E20, more like twice as bright with a longer throw.  Maybe I should have gone for the TK45 with more flood as I think it would be more useful for the majority of tasks I do with a flashlight, such as walking to the mailbox, hiking paths in the woods at night, or doing pool maintenance I didn't get around to during daylight hours.<br /><br />It's still a great flashlight and a MAJOR upgrade over any incandescent light like a maglight, just a disappointment when compared to the other great (cheaper) fenix lights I already own.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|There is this whole big comment block in front of me and I have to admit it is a daunting task to try and say how much I loved this book.<br />I am glad I came into this series late and was able to pick up the first 5 volumes and read them in one sitting (one long sitting with a few annoying bathroom and sleep breaks in between).  My condolences to those who had to wait for each part.  I will now buy the next one, grateful that it is there.<br /><br />Thank you Mr. Howey.

B0002234LS|5.0|I'm not the type of person to have crushes on every or some actors. But when it comes to Johnny Depp, I have a big crush on him. I didn't get a chance to see this movie in theaters, but once it came out on DVD I new I had to have it. I must say this movie is another great Johnny Depp movie. He is a great actor in it and he looks very sexy. Even when he is laying around in his ripped bathrobe. That look make's me want him even more.

B00845PV16|2.0|I was expecting this to be more like the 1st one, but wow, this felt way different.  I didn't like how they did the filming, nor the music, felt totally like a Brit production, but to be fair, I'm not a fan of Brit movies.  The rider was way different, looked like a rag doll puppet, gets hit by an rpg in the beginning, and he ends up in the hospital??  Don't get me wrong effects in spots were very cool.  However, just a lot of unanswered questions, felt like we jumped right in the middle of a movie already in progress, Brit style film...  Some cameos, but overall, nowhere near what I was hoping for, and expecting, based on the first movie.

0824835921|4.0|[I have modified my review a little, comments at the end]<br /><br />This book is top notch at it's intended goal - to learn what kanji mean. I read through 30 kanji character descriptions twice and can tell you what they all mean at first glance. Less than 30 minutes of study. I think some of the more complex kanji will take a little more study, but so far it's been easy.<br /><br />The downside - no pronunciation. At all. That means, you may be able to read it and know what it means, but you'll have no idea how to say it, or how to recognize it if someone else says it to you.  So, if learning to read is your only goal, this book is perfect! If you want to speak the language, you're going to have to do your own footwork and discover the pronunciations. I've been writing them in the book along with the kanji.<br /><br />[edits to follow]<br /><br />After using this book for two weeks, I've changed my attitude slightly. I really do like the book, but I think it's unclear initially that it's ONLY for meaning <-> kanji, and not for pronunciation. Apparently the next book contains methods for remembering pronunciation. With that said, this book is really good for creating memory/recall links. I've just finished Chapters 1-5, which is a total of 98 kanji, and I remember them all.<br /><br />According to the book, a person who has only a few hours of study time a day can memorize all the characters from the book in approximately 4 months, assuming 20 kanji a day 7 days a week.  They claim full time study, the entire \\"Remembering the Kanji\\" course (all three books), can be completed in 4-6 weeks.<br /><br />I find that to be an amazingly questionable assertion, but I suppose if someone did devote 7-8 hours a day to study, they could memorize them, given how much I remember from the few hours of total study time I've done for the first 100.<br /><br />Anyway, we'll see where I stand in a month. If I can do 20 a day, that's 600 in a month. The biggest problem I see with this, though, is long term retention through use.

0143113100|5.0|I thank Dr. Doidge for writing this very fascinating book about a very important subject. I believe that doing so also required not only great insight but also a certain amount of courage. His book explains the apparent paradox of my personal experiences as a toddler, and far beyond. Beginning when I was a baby, I suffered severe illnesses: diphtheria, whooping cough and a middle ear infection that left me with a big surgical scar behind one ear, and with a chronic ear infection that lasted for decades. I even had to have two more surgeries as an adolescent to remove \\"wild meat,\\" that is granulation, proud flesh, from my remaining ear cavity.<br /><br />Forgive my self-promotion, but I am an outstanding, albeit unwitting, lab rat role model whose experiences verify, at least to some extent, some of the subject matter of Doidge's book. As a matter of fact, since my latest episode of healing I have become obsessed to share these healing experiences whenever I can.<br /><br />After my original ear surgery so long ago, I was not able to walk anymore and people also thought that I had become an \\"idiot.\\" However, Dr. Doidge's book has convinced me that these early-life physical traumas, along with many other diverse, intense, prolonged ones during the first two dozen years of my life, were changing my brain through frequent re-mapping to adapt to them. Many people that have read my story cannot believe that I am still sane and even alive.  You can read my very unusual and almost unbelievable memoir at:<br /><br />[[ASIN:0595223141 Heroes from the Attic: A Gripping True Story of Triumph]]<br /><br />Unfortunately, after its publication I had to greatly curtail my public contact and marketing of it because of slow poisoning that was very difficult to diagnose. However, after it was finally diagnosed, I was able to very slowly recover, and in some ways, I now feel better than ever.<br /><br />Again, thank you, Dr. Doidge, you have helped me understand my seemingly miraculous endurance through unbelievable traumatic experiences. The knowledge I gained from your book encourages me to continue to write another book about what I have learned and gained from my long journey to excellent health.<br /><br />Wishing you the best of health,<br />Herman I Neumanendurance through unbelievable traumatic experiences.

If I read one more \\"...oh my\\" I thought I would vomit.<br />This book is for mommies with no lives and a sex life so lacking that they find this titillating. A big red flag for me was that people who NEVER read are devouring these books.<br />I'd like my $9.99 back now.

B006OV7RQ4|5.0|Sean Durkin has created a powerful, albeit subtle, film about what happens after you leave a cult environment.  I watched this film first and then watched the short film \\"Mary Last Seen\\" on the dvd extras.  I say the word \\"film\\" as the difference between a \\"movie\\" and a \\"film\\".  A movie is what Adam Sandler just put out there with \\"Thats My Boy\\" .. the same drible comedy but not a film.  Martha Marcy Mae Marlene is a \\"film\\" in the truest sense as it makes you think about the powerful story it conveys... when you watch it I guarantee you your thought processes will still be thinking about why Martha never conveys her story to her sister or what powerful hold Patrick has over her mind or whether she will ever be able to escape and heal from her experience.  And once you watch \\"Mary Last Seen\\" (extra on DVD) you will be looking for her in this movie as Watts recruited her with finesse and expertise and he still tries to coax Martha out of the diner at the beginning when she has \\"escaped\\"... I say this lightly as she has escaped physically but not mentally... a powerful film that makes you think long after it is done
B003VANOFY|5.0|I've had a few other surround sound headsets and the wire that goes into the earpiece was always shorting out and causeing some speakers not to work.  I would have to return it, wait for a replacement only to have them do the same thing again.  This headset eliminates that issue.  There are no wires!  The \\"surround sound\\" sounds pretty damn good and they are very comfortable.  The mic works great and the wireless is awesome.  I would deffinately recommend this product to anyone that games at night or uses vent/teamspeak/mumble.
B00792EGES|5.0|This concert was amazing and my second Blu Ray concert purchase. Alter Bridge is amazing and I will continue to buy concert dvds of them if they make more of them. As close to being there, comes with a cd with live tracks from the show but not all songs, like 13 tracks and the concert blu ray has 21 songs; why it's like that I have no idea. If you are a fan of Alter Bridge, you'll love this product.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This has to be the eleventh time that I have reread specific portions of The Night Circus in the past 9 months. A veteran Harry Potter fanatic, I scrambled to pick up a copy after my father said an editor had compared it to HP. After having read this novel, I realize that the editor could not have been farther from the truth. TNS is something else entirely... the imagery of the wonders within this circus of black and white is so striking (but simultaneously gentle) that one cannot help but close her eyes and hear the soft, tinkling melodies, watch the orange flames flicker on the Wishing Tree, sway with the seas of black ink, inhale the sweet aroma of caramel... The Night Circus is a primarily Victorian era novel telling the story of two magicians, Celia and Marco, who have been bound to a mysterious competition of magical endurance by their instructors, the arena being the enchanting Night Circus. The refreshingly brief chapters weave amongst the perspectives of performers and circus devotees as well as Celia and Marco, all of which eventually relate back to the game. The catch? The 'opponents,' Celia and Marco are destined for one another- 'love' seems a feeble word to describe what they have for each other. To touch each other results in a tingling warmth, manipulations in the world about them, such as quivering chandeliers and broken china. Their romance is not overbearing to readers, as is often the case in novels that attempt to describe love but fail horribly (e.g. Twilight) but it is an ornament to ths elaborate tree of emotions that will thrive inside of you as you read this novel. This book is the river to feed a reader that thirsts for text which serenades your senses. Trust me- will find yourself rereading portions of the novel again and again. As for a film, though the thought excites me, I fear that a film producer will not properly capture The Night Circus as I have dreamed of it for months after having completed it. The best visual way to describe The Night Circus is the Noveau performance of Cirque du Soleis in Orlando, FL. I recently saw it and honestly I was shocked and how it reminded me immediately of Night Circus. Perhaps Erin Morgenstern's primary source of inspiration? I wouldn't doubt it one bit. Read The Night Circus- you will not regret it. It is the type of novel that is meant to be with you forever... in fact, you will find yourself yearning to wear a red scarf yourself. ;)

157421327X|5.0|I recently ordered Zentangle Basics by Suzanne McNeill and it is a wonderfully written book on the artform.  It is a book where one can learn how to create intricate drawings out of your imagination!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have read many books and short stories in my life, particularly in the realms of fantasy and science fiction.  In my mind, there is nothing closer to a perfected story than Wool.  The writing is tight, the story is immensely satisfying, the description is appropriate but efficient and it is impossible to put down.  Just when you think you know what is going on, some new detail of the world Howey creates is revealed and your whole perspective shifts.<br />I am telling everyone I know to read Wool, and now I'm telling the entire Amazon universe to read it as well.  I read the Omnibus (all 5 books) and I did it in a day an a half (see, I told you--you can't put it down!) so I'm not able to currently pull apart each book and review them separately.  If you eventually read them, then you'll know what I mean when I say that this fact is earning me no \\"fan points\\" but hopefully the fact that the day after I finally put it down I got two others to read it will help.<br />So my parting words--read this book.  Do it.  Now.

B006Z20976|5.0|Courageous is definitely a wonderful movie to watch. The actors were absolutely perfectly selected, however, I am familiar with a couple of the actors one of which appeared in the movie Fireproof. One of the reasons I enjoyed the movie so much is because I feel it takes a courageous man to be a good husband and father today. It is very challenging for a man to be the head of the household in today's society. Men have to maintain his family financially, spiritually and morally and still have to go out and support his family. I rate this movie an A+ and recommend it for families and church socials.

0553801473|4.0|It might just be the fantasy nerd in me, but I truly imagine that George Martin has himself a set of twenty-sided dice. My wonderings continue to visualize Martin labeling each of his main characters with a number on one side. He rolls the dice. Death to the winner! Martin has no loyalty to his characters, as realistic as reality in terms of the arbitrary quality of accident, purpose, and fate. I love this about Martin and the Song of Ice and Fire. But I hate him for it, too. This dichotomous relationship doesn't end at the life and death of a particular character or twenty. My mixed feelings continue in each of his five books that so far establish the series.<br /><br />The Prose<br /><br />If you like good writing, you'll love Martin; but, you'll detest him in this arena as well. His grammar and diction are impeccable--his syntax superb. Reading `most' of his writing is a pleasure, but it can also be a tedious journey that mirrors the turmoil of his characters. Appropriate or testing?<br /><br />An example. Martin might say something like (these are far from exact quotes--actually, I made them up entirely), \\"There were many knights at the gathering. There was Garl from the Wolfhead Clan with his bronze shield and iron dagger. Then came Smoot of the Hollow Mountain, his hair twisted and...etc. etc.\\" This list could mention thirty-some names, mostly characters with no role in the plot, just providers of depth in a world not lacking it. Martin goes overboard sometimes in the scope and breadth of the grandeur of his fantastical universe. There are many such lists and most are unnecessary to the n'th degree, aggravating even. I doubt I am the only reader who skips them almost entirely.<br /><br />I can only imagine Martin's brilliance at keeping up with it all. The detail is something that makes the series unique and awe-inspiring, but it also clouds the flow of simply enjoying a good read--something all fantasy-lovers share.<br /><br />The Black Hole<br /><br />I wonder if Martin dug himself into a hole reminiscent of the writer's from the TV series Lost. Can he possibly wrap-up the seemingly infinite plot lines he's created? He's a master of the craft and genre, so I sure as hell hope so, but with only two books left to go in the series...I have my doubts.<br /><br />I'm addicted to the `game of thrones' as it plays out for readers. Like our own world, so many lust for power, but when is it too much to maintain the scope of a good, manageable story? Maybe this simply isn't Martin's concern. Maybe he's ok if we as readers don't follow it all or don't want to follow it all. Stephen King, in his book On Writing, used the metaphor of a sculptor for the writer and the writing process. As a writer chips away at his story, the world, character, and plot are revealed. Maybe Martin is just telling it like it is, sharing the world as he discovers it.<br /><br />But damn-it man...will Daenerys ever make it home? What about this king or that one? Will he take true power? Did you really just kill off Snow? If not, what the heck were you doing to us man?<br /><br />It's these very frustrations that make me want to read--as much as I complain. It's the same reason I loved the pain-inducing finale of King's Dark Tower series, when Roland comes to find he's back at the beginning.<br /><br />But, I'm still worried. I'll have faith in Martin, for now--I just want to see if he can pull it off.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />I don't regret a word I ready in the five-book series. I will admit I skipped some, and I almost never do this. I savor every word in the genre. But, for many reasons, I found myself skipping across the more boring sections like a stone across a lake, just touching down for a moment to make sure I wasn't missing anything. Then, I'd fall back into the depths of good-story telling, and find myself immersed in an unparalleled adventure.<br /><br />I highly recommend A Song of Ice and Fire, but be prepared for war. You'll battlewith the effort in the intake, the lengthy diatribes into space, and the long waits between your favorite characters. But it's worth it. The toil is Martin's test to the reader. I hope you're worthy.<br /><br />[...]with the effort in the intake, the lengthy diatribes into space, and the long waits between your favorite characters. But it's worth it.

1936608898|5.0|I'm a nutritionoholic. Meaning, for the last 20 years I spend spare time learning about holistic, natural health and food practices, and I also have always struggled with my desire for unhealthy sugar/fat snacks and treats. Always. Despite any way of eating I've chosen (vegan, vegetarian, raw, atkins, hCG, etc..) I eat well, and primarily high quality whole and organic foods. Even when I ate paleo, I strugged with overcomsuming the foods I made that were deserts, or sweet.<br /><br />After reading this book, I finally understand WHY. After giving up sugar/sweeteners, processed foods, and grains for six weeks now, I can finally say I have busted through my sugar cravings. In fact, for the first time in my life I am not talking to myself about what to eat all day long. I eat at meal times. I eat healthy foods. Done. Eating this cleanly has also made it MUCH easier to discover which foods are my \\"trigger\\" foods, what foods make me feel tired, over-hungry, foggy...so not just that I can choose not to eat them but also I CAN choose to eat them very occasionally with awareness of how I'll feel after, and what to expect with my cravings and prepare for that.<br /><br />The Hartwigs are funny, casual, but thorough, and very personable. They don't make claims that are unsubstantiated by science, but even acknowledge that there are contradictory studies out there, and encourage the reader to do the program to find out for themselves. Don't take their word for it. I learned so much more information too! With all my hobby research, I thought I knew most things about how foods affect the body and why, but there was a lot in here that was new for me, and helped me understand so much more. There is relief in that.<br /><br />I believe I have found the way of eating that makes me feel more like myself. I highly recommend it to anyone that cares even a little bit about their health.

You will not regret it.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I purchased this set when it was on \\"Today's Deals\\" one day... low price.<br /><br />the set came as I had expected it and in perfect time.  Right before the opening weekend of Prometheous.<br /><br />I have to say that I've never seen Alien or Aliens in such a clear format.  I have an HD Sony XBR set with Verizon Fios... I thought that I had seen Aliens in the best picture but actually i had not until this bluray set.<br /><br />I'm happy I made the purchase and would highly recommend it to any Alien fan.<br /><br />Thanks
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This was a REALLY good book!  Wow...  sophiscated landscape, well defined believable characters and superior story telling. I am a voracious reader and aspiring writer and Anthony Ryan has created the book I dream of writing.  Well worth the read.  Thank you, Mr. Ryan.
B007ZRZF8I|1.0|I must admit that this is a good game, simple concept and good execution. The downiside is the shady practices the developers have taken, that is Open Feint and in app purchases that cripple the gameplay. That without considering thr adds and the constant reminders to rate the app.
B000IKAHN2|4.0|For Season 1, Episode 1 and 2 have some editing problems.  On Amazon Instant Video there are 2-3 minutes of black screen throughout the episodes, I'm assuming where the commercials would have been.  The formatting seems to have been corrected by episode 3 and beyond.
159562015X|3.0|This book arrived in my hands at the perfect time. If you have delved into self discovery before, this book might not be for you because it lacks detail. However, the accompanying Strength Finder Assessment was right on the mark and helped me find the vocabulary to define my strengths. When I explored all of the strengths, I found myself wishing that I was more \\"Strategic.\\" The basic overview was helpful, but I think the book should have more substance about how I can develop this strength since it isn't one of my five top strengths.
B003T6GVWI|3.0|I just can't get into this album like I did with Fever and Body Language. Those albums were amazing, sensual, and mesmerizing. Some songs on here feel too light and fluffy for me.  I did like a few dance tracks, but this album just feels basic and monotonous to me that I wish I had listen to the previews before buying this album.<br /><br />Fav tracks:<br />1-Get Outta My Way<br />2-Put Your Hands Up<br />3-Aphrodite
B005LAIGN2|1.0|The first thing you should know regarding the new WWII aviation melodrama \\"Red Tails\\" is that if you haven't seen the movie, but have seen the trailer, then you have already seen \\"Red Tails\\". That's right, the movie is nothing more than a two hour extension of the three minute trailer. The film consists of nothing more than a lot of CGI aerial dogfights, no character development, little historical reference, and absolutely nothing engaging.<br /><br />The movie, executive produced by effects guru George Lucas, begins in mid-battle and never seems to land, there is no attempt to set up a story. The characters are interchangeable, the dialogue painful to hear, it's right out of the cliched WWII efforts of the actual era. The movie never has a thought or a point to make, the historical elements are quickly glanced over like cliff notes, the picture barely touches on the key racial elements of the pilots conflict with the American air force.<br /><br />Everything about this movie is a mess, even the casting is all wrong. The usually reliable Terence Howard is miscast, too soft spoken and polite too really grab the audience, or the men under his command for that matter, by the throat and drill into them the cause that they are working towards. There needs to be something more invested in this movie by the filmmakers if they have any hope of getting the audience into this flick. It doesn't even successfully pander to the audience.<br /><br />There is a much better 1995 HBO telefilm [[ASIN:B00319ECI8 The Tuskegee Airmen]], that while still flawed at least hits a number of the marks and paints a far more accurate and engaging portrait of these often forgotten American heroes. It is interesting to note that Cuba Gooding, Jr. appears in both of these films, he was also in Michael Bay's \\"Pearl Harbor\\" which is the movie that \\"Red Tails\\" most resembles. This is without question one of the worst representations of history and American filmmaking I hope to ever see. A truly terrible and insulting motion picture experience.<br /><br />Check out my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com

B0086700CM|5.0|greatest adventure game made yet. addictive and more than handy when needed. especially when your chick is doing homework. get it
B00782O7IY|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater and I could not wait until it came out on DVD so I could see it again.  I went to the Malco thinking I was going to be bored to death but I have never been quite so entertained.  The two main characters didn't need words.  They said it all with body language, sometimes even sexy body language, facial expressions, stunning dance moves and costumes, tears, smiles, and sheer charisma. Within a very few minutes into the film I was lost in the story.  I hated when it ended because I wanted to see more.  If you enjoy dance, beauty, romance, and all things amore, you will fall in love with these characters and this story.
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|I love the book so much and this movie is one of my favorite versions.  I've seen other versions and the acting made me cringe.  I know I sound like a total girl but Mr. Rochester was gorgeous and I think the actress who played Jane was perfect.  When she is away from him and can hear his voice in the wind and she started calling back to him I cried like a baby haha.  I want to watch it again and again.
0143038419|3.0|It was a good book that kept a smile on my face throughout. I would consider the book cute but not that great read you're looking for. I think it was written well, but disliked the movie. Not a book I would read twice.
B0058YPGL6|5.0|I'm probably one of the only teenage guys that watches this show, but its pretty awesome. I thought this show would just be one season but i was glad to see the second season episodes started airing about a month ago, which I have been following and the story is getting so much better.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|works fine on my Samsung epic... we shall see how it works on my new phone tomorrow. does it work with ice cream? we shall see.
B007N8RULO|4.0|Has some delays but can be addicting trying to beat the time. More levels and / or card suits would be nice.

B007L3BMGA|5.0|This book should be read by all men, imagine the improvement it would bring in communication in the relationship when each partner could express their needs.
B005LAIGP0|4.0|Suprised how decent this movie was a good thriller. Worth a watch if you like Suspense type movies Hammer Productions is always a safe bet
B007P6VLRS|5.0|I'm not into song by song reviews; but reviews of albums as a whole.  One, two, etc. songs do not define a band or an album (IMO).  Oceania was not promoted as promised by the band.  I attended an SPRC meeting before a concert in which the band did a Q&A session.  The band announced that Oceania would be a turning point for the band depending on record sales and may in fact determine the future of SP.  I almost saw zero promotion for the album prior to its release.  My own anticipation kept me interested as an SP fan as there was a lack of commercialization.  As important as this album is to the band, they did nothing to promote it; not smart.  However, as a fan, I of course made the purchase.<br /><br />I have to say that Oceania is a breath of fresh air after having forced the utter disappointment of Zeitgeist upon myself.  Zeitgeist was one of the worst comeback albums of all time (IMO).  The album was the equivalent to Metallica's St. Anger album...terrible (luckily Metallica came back with Death Magnetic).  The music videos that followed did not portray SP in any way, shape, or form.  One of the videos looked too much Zwan-ish.  This led to misconceptions that the band going under the SP name was only a revamped Zwan.  With the exception of a few songs (mostly the bonus songs attached to every version of the album) the album was terrible, drawn-out and a disappointment.  Oceania IS THE ALBUM that Zeitgeist should have been.  Oceania IS SP.  Oceania takes all the years of SP sounds and rolls them up into this fantastic album.<br /><br />The last track of Oceania,\\" Wildflower,\\" is the only negative I see for the album.  The song is OK; however, it doesn't belong with the rest of the album...an oddball of sorts.  I give the album a 9/10 for this point alone.  I agree with others that it would have been nice to hear real strings versus a synth.  There are songs on Oceania that remind me of other SP albums prior to Zeitgeist and therefore give the album the classicSP feel.  Gish to Machina II to me is classic SP.  I enjoyed every album to include Oceania except Zeitgeist.  I do have to say I have enjoyed most of the Teargarden By Kaleidyscope songs as well.<br /><br />In business, especially the music business, promotion is essential to success.  SP has failed at this once again thus far (Zeitgeist had more promotion).  Believe it or not, radio can save the day.  Call in to your local radio stations and request songs from Oceania because that is the only promotion the album is going to get.  I remember when Melancholy came out, \\"Tonight, tonight,\\" along with the other singles were on radio and TV constantly and in your face.  Look how well the album was received.  \\"Tonight, tonight,\\" was the first SP song I ever heard.  The music video and the song just grabbed me; I was hooked.  Radio play may in fact aid Oceania to its rightful level of popularity.  Also, those that have remorse feelings towards the band line-up can get over it.  The present line-up that has outputted Oceania is obviously the right choice because the album actually feels like an SP album.  Billy does not support drug addicts (his former SP band mates) it seems as a personal policy.  I for one stand by that.  They are the reason for SP's failure in 2000, all except probably Melissa (IMO).  Even if you own Oceania, do the band a favor and call in radio requests anyhow.  \\"The Celestials,\\" would make a good radio single.  SP believes in the album as a whole and therefore did not release any singles.  I get that, but every album needs a single to succeed.  For all we know, the future of SP may be determined upon how well Oceania is received.
034580404X|5.0|LOVED IT!!!  Could not wait to get the other 2!!  This is a must for any relationship in turmoil!!  Just remember when reading that batteries are NOT included!! :)
0985114606|1.0|The book club review said \\"if you loved 50 Shades, you'll LOVE this!\\"<br />WRONG<br />I felt like the author read all three of the 50 Shades, then went to bed, had a wet dream, woke up and wrote this book.<br />I literally could (and DID!) highlight everything exactly copied from 50 Shades. My book is now pink and yellow highlighted full.

B004SDEP38|1.0|don't get this app-you have to have the full version  for everything!!!! :(  worst app ever  do not even think about getting this app---LAME!
0345803485|1.0|As an author myself (non-fiction, a dog memoir, so I am not a direct competitor), I was more than prepared and happy to support one of my fellow self-published sisters. Trapped by a recent appendectomy with nothing else to read during my convalescence, I picked up this interminable trilogy and marveled at how mouth-hangingly awful, hackneyed, REPETITIVE, unimaginative, tedious, thin-plotted, sloppy, and forgettable it is. Putting aside the completely unrealistic premise of a billionaire \\"mover and shaker\\" so attuned to his college-aged vacuous marshmallow of a bland heroine that he notices infinitesimal changes of expression on her face and comments about them obsessively--(I get it--it's a fantasy for the 99.5% of women whose boyfriends/husbands wouldn't notice if they replaced their own hair with yarn)--the book is just bad. Really really bad.<br /><br />Whoever advised E.L. James to use characters emailing each other as a vehicle to drive along the action needs to re-think his or her profession; I can't fathom anything more boring for an audience. I don't find even my own emails back and forth that interesting, much less two people who basically blather the same exact conversations between them ad nauseum.<br /><br />I'm glad I wasn't the only one who saw this unbelievable dreck as Twilight with (faux, humdrum) S&M. Ana Bella. Carrick Carlisle. Christian Edward. Ana's father Bella's father. Lazy lazy lazy Ms. James. Wouldn't it be funny if this is really Stephanie Meyer in disguise, writing her own pathetic, randy story of how she REALLY wanted the vampire saga to play out?<br /><br />Anyway, back to the book. Plot tangents started up and then went nowhere. And did we really need THREE books? Every. \\"hot\\". scene. started. and. ended. the. exact. same. way. Did this plodding sameness really do it for people? If so, I feel really sad for the libidos of women in this country. Romance novel bodice rippers do a better job. If I wanted to read the caliber of erotica that's in the Shades of Grey series, I should have just re-read Shanna by Kathleen Woodwiss and pretended I was 15 again.
B0079XPUOW|4.0|I enjoyed _Redshirts_ tremendously, once I got past the first few chapters.  Don't let the first few chapters fool you - the book<br />does go in unexpected and entertaining directions.<br /><br />The 3 codas at the end are the best part, but they won't make sense if you don't read the book first :)
B005LAIH2W|5.0|Saw it in the theater loved it, and just bought the DVD LOVED IT AGAIN!<br /><br />I heard a review on one of the More Serious News Broadcast Channels the morning before we went to see JC on it's opening friday night. she claimed it was unwatchable and said she saw many people \\"walk out of the theater.\\"<br /><br />Seriously, walk out of the theater bad?<br /><br />Reviewers don't use terms like that lightly right?<br /><br />I almost didn't go.<br /><br />To me that's not just indulging in a little rhetorical exaggeration. That's making a specific claim. She didn't say non fans won't like it but that genre fans might like it. She claimed it was so bad that many people walked out.<br /><br />That should be pretty bad right? SWAMP THING or HIGHLANDER 2 bad or worse.<br /><br />Yet, in the theater I was at, no one left, in fact, the crowd all seemed to enjoy the film. I had just seen Ghost Rider 2 a few weeks earlier and no one walked out of that either but it was pretty bad. That's all I need. Drag the wife to another Ghost Rider 2,  Jonah Hex or Last Airbender. But we went anyway, she knows I'm a huge fan of the Edgar Rice Burrough's Mars books, and have been looking forward to it.<br /><br />But it was fun. I liked it a lot. Not the greatest movie ever made to be sure, but not bad at all, in fact a pretty fun epic adventure film, and certainly not bad enough to walk out of. I did read several positive reviews online from \\"genre\\" sites, people whose credibility depends on actually seeing the thing over the weekend. I wonder if the TV reviewer even saw the film or just read about it online.<br /><br />Sure as a fan of the novels I could take issue with a few things, here and there, but mostly the changes were to save time, smoothed out some clunky stuff or create a more coherent story-line, for a possible trilogy. I was a little sad that much of the friendship and loyalty building that occurred over time with several of the novels characters was extremely shortened oreliminated entirely.  John Carter teaches the Martians much about animal training, building the loyalty of his martian dog and steed, that was left out. Much of the Green Martian politics, John Carter's brutal rise in their ranks was more or less left out. And his friendship with the Red Martian Kantos Kan was also left out. Much of this seemed to be cut for time.<br /><br />But enough of the action, adventure, charm and wonder survived to make a truly fun fantasy adventure film.<br /><br />Yes tastes vary, but the overwhelming negative reviews compared to the actual movie seems completely disproportionate.<br /><br />When a movie that has gotten so much overwhelmingly bad reviews turns out to be not only NOT the worst movie ever made, but turns out to be a fun, average action, adventure film, you can't tell me their weren't reviewers out there who didn't bother to see a film they had heard so much negativity about and saved time by writing a review playing along with what they thought was the general reviewer consensus.<br /><br />It doesn't take much paranoia to believe this movie was a victim of bad marketing, overblown expectations and some sort of a negative rumor campaign.<br /><br />I even loved the logo. It became a symbol of what was wrong with the film. So over worried about words like \\"Mars\\" and \\"princess...\\" it seemed to me that they were so afraid of saying the wrong things, with the title, they said nothing.<br /><br />So most of the marketing said nothing as well. Where were all the typical over the top hyperbole filled ads...<br /><br />\\"From the studio that brought you Pirates of the Carribean<br />From the Academy Award winning director of Finding Nemo and WALL-E<br />From the creator of the legendary Lord of the Jungle, TARZAN of the apes...<br /><br />Before Avatar<br />Before Star Wars<br />Before everything else...<br /><br />Edgar Rice Burrough's John Carter Warlord of Mars!\\"<br /><br />When comics publishers had a similar dilemma with choosing a name for their comic series adaptations, both Big Little books and Dell Comics went with \\"John Carter of Mars,\\" and in the '70's Marvel Comics went with \\"John Carter, Warlord of Mars.\\" Dynamite Entertainment currently uses just \\"Warlord of Mars\\" largely because they are using the character without permission, (public domain).<br /><br />Any of these titles would have worked better. They were time tested at the very least. If you are going to do a movie like this and you are getting worried about the word \\"mars\\" you need to step aside and let someone do it who will embrace the word.<br /><br />IMDb users gave the film an average vote of 6.9 out of 10, IRON MAN 2 only got a 7.0, Fandago rating, Fans reviewers say \\"go\\" and Critics say \\"so-so\\" not the worst review you can get by far, basically a 4 out of 5 and 3 out of 5 respectively.<br /><br />Try and defend the film on a message board online, and you will find some seriously angry people, who can't tell you specific things they didn't like about the film but seem personally invested in the failure of the film. John Carter was no better or worse than many other cgi laden action films. It certainly cost more money to make than most, but you can't honestly tell me it wasn't as good as if not better than Green Lantern, Cowboys and Aliens, Conan the Barbarian (2011), Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance, Tron: Legacy? And it was certainly better than the low budget SyFy channel awful, Antonio Sabato Jr. version called \\" A Princess of Mars.\\"<br /><br />The film did much better overseas. Are we supposed to believe the international market just liked a \\"bad\\" movie, yet the US market wasn't fooled? A more plausible theory, the fact that it did better overseas demonstrated the American market had initially been influenced by the extremely bad reviews, and rumors painting it as \\"the worst movie ever made,\\" depressing initial ticket sales in those critical first few days, which is all you need to kill the momentum of a big budget movie in short window of opportunity movies have in the theaters here in the states. JC flopped for a variety of reasons, unrelated to it's quality. But being an average film didn't help when it came to over coming it's other issues, but it wasn't a bad film, it just wasn't a great film.
B00845PT18|5.0|4th best movie i have seen this year it had a ton of action and excitement it was very amazing
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I read all of the bad press concerning the so called financial disaster of John Carter, went to see the film and loved it.  What a marvelous job this production crew and writer did  in getting this all to come together in such a visually entertaining way.  ERB was a primary inspiration in the development of Ray Bradbury as a writer, and John Carter was a favorite.  Ray died about two weeks before the DVD was released.  I only hope somehow he got a copy of it and had the opportunity to see the stories come alive.  I know he would have been very proud of the work that was done.  I now own the DVD, just watched it and felt compelled to tell folks how good I think it really is.  If you don't know the background it is interwoven into the story so well that you feel like you were there.  The DVD has some great interviews with the folks who made it production and that helps as well.  Fear not the publicity of failure.  It may make enough in DVD sales to break a profit eventlually.  Over all I gave it five stars and recommend to anyone who likes a good sci-fi thriller with a historical connection.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I actually really like this app. haha, it makes time fly by, and its FREE!  I love that it has different varieties of games. but I wish it was a little easier to earn coins. :P that's all(:
B000005B0U|5.0|I had been wanting the Soundtrack ever since the movie came out, and for some reason, never got it! I was watching t.v. one day, and the movie was on, and when they sang \\"funky nassau\\", it sounded JUST as awesome as it did YEARS ago! I was dancing around the room like a hyped up fool!<br />I looked all over for it, but it wasn't the original soundtrack. I don't know why I didn't look on Amazon first (trippin'), but there it was! I HURRIED UP and got it THIS time, and am about to wear it out!
B0086700CM|5.0|Love this game! It's so so so so so addictive. It is very fun. But the creepy animals running behind him scare me! O.o
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I actually bought this for my 10 year old daughter. She loves it.  She can sit down with it and draw for an hour.  She gave it a five star rating. This application is easy to use and works well with kindle fire.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This was absolutely one of the best books I have ever read.  It was so good, that I could not believe it was a debut novel.  Highly, highly, recommend.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game!! I'm so glad it came out for kindle fire. Its really addicting and fun when you are bored. It challenging to try to beat your high score and longest run. It's the best game EVER!!!!!!
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I have had this case for about 3 months and so far it is amazing. It fits the fire which some cases dont and holds up very well. The only problem that i have found is that it gets kind of dirty. It works just the way it was designed and I drop my fire alot and so far no scratces. The felt cover is supposed to be soft againsted the screen to protect it nothing else. This product was designed very well; I am extremly happy with it.
B0086700CM|4.0|great game but 5 star,  is it the best game in the world!  but I think this game is really fun!
B000SXMSJ0|5.0|Buying CD's via the MP3 download feature is WONDERFUL and so easy! You'll be instantly listening to your favorite album.  Can't beat the deals on Amazon either!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app. I get to play a bunch of games. when I cant pass a game I get 5 chances and still get points for it. so fun and sometimes hard.
B005723JSQ|5.0|This is one of Sophie Kinsella's best yet! For all her Shopoholic book fans, this one will not disappoint. I was hooked from the first chapter.<br />The author has a humor of which I cannot get enough. I have read all her books and cannot wait for the next!
B0086700CM|4.0|its a good game .. plus its free ,<br />might get old, but its entertaining none the less and there's a lot of things to unlock
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book was \\"OK\\", but I don't understand all the HYPE...I heard someone refer to it as \\"Mommy porn\\"!! There were some very graphic and illicit details and some very sexy passages, but basically it was \\"Boy meets girl, girls' a virgin, Boy introduces girl to kinky sex\\"...Half-way through I was bored with the \\"Will she, won't she\\" of it all..  It definitely does not merit a Part II or Part !!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I must master it! I love this game and each time I play it I loose patience....I need to move as quickly as the game so I can win....
B0086700CM|5.0|I absolutely LOVVVVE Temple run! it is just sooooooo AWSOME!!!! So whoever gave it a rating below 5 you need to get a life.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book keeps you on the edge of not knowing what will happen next. Element of suprise. Loved the whole series.
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|I did not find the movie boring when I saw it on Netflix However it was slow-paced,Maybe people were expecting Some Cullen type garbage or Artsy(So-called)Cinema.Well,I found it to be a bit slow but the action was there,gritty at times and yet at the same time despite the assertions that is based off a novel and the Movie has nothing to do with The Driver,there is some elements of The Driver in there. The Driver is Better than this to be sure,You can't remake or ReDo or Reboot something but that cannot take away the merit of this movie,Good Plot,no questions asked and Great Car-Chevelle. It's not some trendy fancy movie and While I am not crazy about the Main Actor chosen for the role and the love angle,I believe it's alot better and more substance than sadly a lot of movies now coming out,I was pleasantly Surprised.
0786958731|5.0|I played for the first time with my husband last night, and it was simple enough to pick up and learn (we didn't do the advanced play)<br />We fudged some of the rules just because we forgot about some of the steps, but we beat the game and had a great time together.<br />We've never played any D&D besides Three Dragon Ante and the video games, but my husband has read some of the books.<br />I liked the character choices and the enemies were interetesting. It was challenging but not so much that we didn't want to keep playing.
B0051BNRTO|5.0|Hornby's back at the topic he knows best, music! It's the story of a one time rock star Tucker Crow, who gives it all up to go into recluse and live a rather inglorious life as a useless husband, but a loving father. Over the internet he meets Annie, who feels she also wasted too many years her life, but in a relationship that led nowhere. Everybody around Tucker seems to have a different notion of who Tucker is and what he's like: ex-wives, children, Annie's ex-boyfriend Duncan, who is obsessed with Tucker and his music, and even Annie herself. But which one of them is right?<br />It's well-written book with characters that are really alive. Annie's relationship with Duncan is especially realistic. There are many fun moments as well which make it an even better read.
B00338QENI|4.0|This book was amazing.  It contained so much information that I was unaware of.  I even have my husband reading it now and he is enjoying it as well.  The author did a fantastic job of researching and blending the facts with the family story.  I highly recommend this book as a quality read.  We owe Henrietta Lacks our debt of gratitude.
B004O3YGMC|2.0|Setup is cumbersome and not intuitive at all.  Could not connect through firewalls at work, may as well just use RDP on port 80 instead of hassling with this.  Logmein does cost, but that comes with some seriously increased benefits.
1936608898|5.0|I began researching new diets back in December on my never-ending quest to be fit and healthy and came across The Whole 30.  I completed my first Whole 30 in January of 2012 and never felt better! I realized this is not a diet, it is a way of life and a fantastic one! I pre-ordered this book and as soon as it arrived I finished it in 2.5 days!<br /><br />This book is incredibly eye-opening and makes things a \\"no-brainer\\" as far as I'm concerned when it comes to what I should ingest.<br /><br />Everyone should read this book!  I even sent a copy to my parents hoping they will FINALLY pay attention to what I've been trying to tell them since January.<br /><br />Thank you for changing my life :)
B0077SGMXM|4.0|Obviously the graphics are not detailed, its a stickman after all.<br /><br />The polish on the menu and settings is VERY good, some of the best I have seen.  Very nicely done.  One thing I wish the instructions were clear about, the speed on the putting green is not relative to the speed elsewhere and sand does not seem to have a negative affect on getting the ball off the ground.  Easily figured out, but the green speed is worth noting.<br /><br />I took off a star because when you finish a course you have to start over in the menu, it would be nice if they let you continue on to the next map in the series.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  Once I finished it I had to immediately start the second one.  The second one is even better. It keeps you in suspense.  Wanting to know more and more. I also immediately started the third one and I can't wait to find out what happens.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Ok, maybe not forever.<br /><br />I've been using this app for awhile now and have been super impressed with it, the Beta 3 is mind blowing.  You do not even need to worry about spaces!  It literally works that good, best virtual keyboard I have ever used.  If I could get it on the iPad I would in a second.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|After reading the reviews, looking at comparable alternatives and weighing costs vs functionality,  I decided to purchase CalenGoo. Initially I was frustrated with set up since there are so many options that could be tweaked, so I sent an email to the developer. Not only did they respond within 15 minutes of my inquiry,  but they were helpful. Their website is very thorough including how to make it function with other web calendars. Although this app works best with google, I praise it for its functionality across other platforms.  Works better than advertised (using Kindle Fire). Well worth the $6 invested.
B0071QIN00|5.0|Its just a solid trails type game that had good physics and is entertaining to play.  The graphics and sound are on par with other games of this nature.
B005COO1X6|5.0|Stephen king has written a ton of books and not everyone likes them all. Mile 81 is one of his better stories in my opinion. Yeah it's a short story but so what. It's nice once in a while to read something that not 800 plus pages. So what is Mile 81 about? It's about a car parked at an abandoned rest stop that eats people. Yup you got it, the car eats people! If you enjoy Stephen King books you will enjoy this story. If you have never read a Stephen King book, Mile 81 is a good way to find out if you like hist style. I gave it five stars because I couldn't find anything I disliked about Mile 81 except I wanted more when it was over and you can't really take a star away for making you want more of something.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love temple run! it is the funnest game ever! I heard they came out with a Brave themed temple run,  I cant wait to get it!
B0086700CM|5.0|I am a gamer who honestly thinks this is the best free game out there currently. It's addictive in ways only the best games are. There's a reason everyone on line is talking about it.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|Everything works great, and it's a fantastic likeness to the Doctor's screwdriver. Only complaint is that mine is fidgety with the UV light and sounds; doesn't always work when I press the buttons. Kinda like how it worked for Matt Smith before he replaced it, lol just not quite so bad.<br /><br />Anyway, glad I bought it. ^^
B004GYY714|5.0|This is an outstanding app! A Super app that everyone must have to stay in touch with the world. Everyone will enjoy the many types of genre's to choose from great radio stations.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I recently upgraded from an AMD 955 CPU to an i5 3570k CPU, and I must say that Intel has gained another convert. This CPU will chew through any game, and I get much better performance than I ever did with the 955--the 3570k simply blows AMD out of the water. I do not do any sort of image editing or video encoding, so this review is written entirely from a gamer's perspective.<br /><br />PROS:<br />-Great for extremely CPU-intensive games like the Total War games (Empire and Shogun 2 in particular). These games are fairly difficult to run smoothly at very high graphics settings due in large part to incredible (but demanding) particle effects, high unit density, shadow effects and many others, but the 3570k has no problems handling Empire at max settings (assuming you have a decent GPU to boot).<br />-I get much higher frame-rates and better performance in games like Crysis, Crysis 2, BF3, Max Payne 3, Empire: Total War, and Deus Ex 3 as well as older games like FEAR, Half-Life 2 and Rome: Total War.<br />-Achieves an overclock of 4.3-4.6GHz without much trouble at all (I've got mine at 4.5 GHz), at least on a Gigabyte Z77-UD3H motherboard.<br />-Using the Gigabyte Z77-UD3H MB I managed to OC to 4.3GHz with no stability issues at stock CPU Vcore voltage (1.13 V).<br />-Built-in Turbo boost feature clocks the 3570k up to 3.8GHz--which is a pretty decent boost and would be a good option for gamers who are uncomfortable with messing with BIOS settings to OC their CPUs.<br /><br />-Almost identical to the 3770K in terms of gaming performance. Benchmark scores for a number of games show marginal (if any) improvements for the 3770k. Other benchmarks and certain games like the Total War series actually see improved frame-rates with the 3570k versus the 3770k.<br /><br />CONS:<br />-It does run somewhat hot--I get temps in the high 70s, low 80s (deg C) with the Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO (with Arctic Silver 5 TIM) at 4.5GHz and 1.35 Volts. However, IB CPUs are designed to withstand more heat, so this is not a huge issue, but it may warrant considering a pricier cooler if you want to OC to around 5 GHz or higher.<br /><br />OVERALL: The 3570k is an excellent CPU for any game on the market with a great performance-to-price ratio. Virtually all gaming performance benchmarks that you will find give near identical results for the 3570k and 3770k, so I would save yourself $100 and take the 3570K over the 3770k and put that money into a better graphics card or an SSD. If you already have a 2500k I would say that a 3570k is not worth the upgrade, but if you have anything older or are looking to switch over to Intel from AMD I would highly recommend it!<br /><br />My PC specs:<br />Gigabyte Z77-UD3H MB<br />i5 3570k OC'd to 4.5GHz with Cooler Master 212 EVO + AS5 TIM<br />EVGA GeForce GTX 680 2GB on stock settings<br />Crucial M4 256GB SSD<br />Corsair Vengeance 1600MHz 8GB DDR3 RAM
B0088XXCZ6|5.0|This album moves further away from her pop-ier first two albums. Her voice is beautiful and powerful and the different styles on the album give each song its own atmosphere.  It took me 3 or 4 listens to really begin to _hear_ the music and to really enjoy it (like her last album, actually), but I've now been listening to it on repeat all day and I love it. Daredevil, Hot Knife, Valentine, Werewolf, and Every Single Night are particularly good (in that order) if you are going to buy songs individually.
B007R21JJK|5.0|I picked up this board for my latest build which included Intel's latest Ivy Bridge i5 3570k CPU, and I must say that I am extremely pleased with everything that this board has to offer.<br /><br />PROS<br />-I had no problems overclocking my 3570k to 4.5 GHz on this board.<br />-Outstanding power control/delivery: In terms of voltage this board delivers exactly what the BIOS says it does (I've had problems with other boards and power delivery when OC'ing).<br />-On-board power/reset buttons, BIOS switch button, and even a button to clear CMOS are all very handy. I feel much more comfortable clearing CMOS values with an on-board button rather than removing the battery.<br />-3D BIOS is very flashy and user-friendly. The mouse support is a great addition as well.<br />-Dual BIOS (via on-board switch) is a handy feature: if one BIOS is corrupted or irreparably damaged you can boot from the second BIOS.<br />-Supports up to 32 GB Dual Channel RAM.<br />-Many USB ports (14) and 6Gb/s SATA connectors.<br /><br />-I've never tested this board's temperature, humidity, or electrostatic damage limits, but I'll take Gigabyte's word for it when they say that it's \\"ultra\\" durable.<br /><br />CONS<br />-Honestly none that I can think of--this is the best MB I've ever owned by far.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: This board is perfect for my current setup (see specs below), and it has more than enough features for my needs. I would recommend this board to anyone--A+ in my book.<br /><br />My PC specs:<br />GA-Z77X-UD3H MB<br />Intel i5 3570k OC'd to 4.5 GHz<br />EVGA GeForce GTX 680<br />Corsair Vengeance 8 GB (2 x 4 GB) DDR3 1600 MHz RAM<br />Crucial M4 256 GB SSD<br />ViewSonic 22-Inch 1080p LED Monitor (1920x1080)
B005GG0MIS|5.0|I bought this book on Audible.com, because the content interested me. Only later did I discover that the authors are *Time* Magazine writers. Fearing having my staunch conservative biases offended by the authors' liberal ones, I donned my internal \\"bias antennae,\\" set them to the \\"Sensitive\\" position, and began to listen.<br /><br />After listening to ninety percent of this book (I'm still savoring it), I haven't found significant liberal bias! Carter, for instance, is portrayed to be the horse's rear I've always envisioned him as. If the book is slanted, I didn't detect it.<br /><br />Instances of crude language are few and far between. When they do occur, they are presented because they came out of a president's mouth, and they show us how that president spoke when the cameras were not around.<br /><br />The wonder of the book, and it is wonderful, is the way it takes me into a world I didn't know existed.  I thought I was well informed, but there is so much interesting information that I never knew!  I get to be a voyeur of sorts, reading the correspondence of presidents, learning of their conversations, their friendships, their rivalries, their challenges met together or created for each other. It's crazy fun!<br /><br />This work is well organized, easy to follow, and a delight. My highest recommendation.
B00846REIS|3.0|Like other reviews I can definitely see the similarities to Fifty Shades of Grey, but this book in no where close to being as enticing. It's one of those books that I'm not mad that I spent the time reading, but I also wouldn't recommend it to my friends. It was just OK.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a long time.  There is a lot of buzz about this book but the plot is what keeps you reading all 3 books.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|This app is great. It gives you the option of chosing black or white and the difficulty of the computer opponent. You can also chose to play against other people. Very good value for a free app
B002MQYOFW|5.0|So addictive once I finished this book i bough the two sequels.  Thank goodness I was able to download them all anytime I wanted because I finished both the first and the second book at 2 in the morning.  Barnes and Noble was closed then! and you can't beat the price, Cheap and fantastic.  A definite purchase!!!
B001FB55H6|5.0|What can i say paid only 5 dollars for this movie outstanding quick shipping a'bit of dust on the back of the disc but no complaints,ha.<br />If you love watchmen buy this now!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love it! It's so much fun! I love the challenge to get even a better score. It is so addictting.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|not much to say its a great app that lets you go on amazon mobile. runs fast and doesn't crash.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|a good game with puzzles. I like puzzles but the story line needs some work its to short. make a part two and three.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is great.  I love how many different games there are and the variety.  I love this game.  its fun.
0307592731|2.0|Being devastated to have lost lost my mother to cancer last year and loving the outdoors, I thought I would really connect with the book. I unfortunately found the book to be slow-moving and bordering on (sometimes jumping full over) the whiny side. Everyone has issues that can leave their life in a wake of destruction, but I don't see how someone destroying their life and deciding to rebuild it by hiking a trail/enduring the elements deserves the attention this book is getting. It is one thing to be a result of crappy circumstances, but the author imposed much of the life-ruining circumstances on herself (e.g. deciding to cheat on her husband, get messed up in heroin, not graduate and have lots of student loans to pay off). I just didn't feel any emotional connection with Cheryl or the story. The only part that evoked some emotion was when they killed the horse.<br /><br />If you are looking for a well-written, intricate tale ... this isn't it. If you are looking for a self-help book from someone who has endured a lot (some of the circumstances uncontrollable, many self-imposed), then that's more what this book provides. I just wasn't a fan =\
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Getting it on my Kindle was the best way to go and I had it immediately! I love the access I have with Amazon!
B007I2BZIE|5.0|This album is right up there with 2112 and Moving Pictures. I love it!!  The last song on the album 'The Garden' just shot to my favorite top 5 favorite RUSH songs. Great album guys!! I am looking forward to seeing them in concert this fall in Seattle!! Your opinion of my review will vary....
B000JML7EC|5.0|This is one of those books everyone should read.  I love this story and I can't believe anyone gave this a one star review!
B0086700CM|3.0|This is a fun game for awhile but not something I'm addicted to like cut the rope or where's my water. Enjoyable.
B0073PZIYI|3.0|It's a very interested premise, but the story shifted too frequently between distant locations which made the story line difficult to follow.
0345472322|5.0|Having been recommended by a business associate, I was looking forward to 'Mindset' with great anticipation. What a pleasure to discover that the principles furthered by Carol Dweck far exceeded my expectations. Aha moments abound fostering personal introspection, and if one truly utilizes the insights presented in this joy of a read, their own life will blossom, plus the positive influence we'll have on others will be incalcuable. A must read!
B006W0QOF2|3.0|Seems to be a cheap version of a movie that would have been fantastic if the producer could have have adapted the script and gotten someone like Edward Norton in the main role.  As it is I just wasn't sympathetic to the main character.
B002D0L0R2|1.0|I was dumb and assumed that what was on the cover was in the package.  When I opened it to play the DVD, I discovered a cd of six songs from the show.  Not what I ordered or needed!
B000ICZD4I|5.0|This movie made me laugh and cry.  I loved it.  I did not want this movie to end.  One of my favorites.
B001G70M6S|5.0|I absolutely love this film. It works just swell for my two Polaroids and has great quality with each photo.
B0041G4POG|5.0|I went out on a limb and ordered these along with a long sleeve top at the same time. I have never tried \\"recovery\\" clothing before, but figured it was worth a shot... and I have to say... they are expensive, but they DO WORK! I felt a little better about the cost after coming to this conclusion.<br /><br />In short, I am using these after heavy leg days at the gym. After a workout I will shower and wear these overnight and into the next day. As a side note, they are very comfortable to sleep in and create a cooling sensation (as opposed to making you hot). I find that they help reduce soreness and shorten the recovery process from 4-5 days to 2-3 days.<br /><br />I am 6'4'' and 215-220 lbs. I ordered a LL and was very happy to see that the fit was perfect! They weren't too short, too tight, or too loose.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I love this app so much!  I love how you get to choose from like twenty notification sounds, and right when someone emails you (if your kindle's on), you'll here the notification sound! I highly recommend this app if you have a Yahoo! Mail account!
B003L77G2Y|5.0|As a long time scifi fan Fringe happens to be in the top ten of my all time favorite TV shows. This list includes The Invaders 1967-68.the first season of Lost In Space, Farscape, Space: Above and Beyond, Firefly and Stargate SGI. Fringe never grows old in its concept. The stories keep getting better and better as time goes on. Let's all hope this show lasts as long as The X Files did in its run.<br />DDW
1400069289|4.0|This book gives really insightful examples of all the ways humans get caught up in their daily habits-many which can become self-destructive, but he really doesn't give a lot of examples of how to BREAK the habits.  One or two suggestions, but it was kind of a cop out at the end.  I wanted more concrete steps that one might take.
B00785P2QC|5.0|this is a great game i love the picture quality on my kindle fire and its literally like my own town/city
B006MPKE9O|4.0|This book took me in just from reading the sleeve.<br />The story of a young lad and a book which like me just appealed to him.<br />Its a book that if you say too much ,could give the plot away.<br />the story line keeps you looking for more and it is hard to put down.<br />if you like this book,which im sure you will ,then i suggest you read The Book Thief<br />and vice-versa you will like The Shadow of the Wind.
B0086700CM|5.0|It is addicting and very fun. I think its just as good as it is on the ipad and ipod touch.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|it is a basic calculator and it functions the way it should.<br />I would recommend it to everyone that wants a basic cal.
B0085W2HAQ|3.0|It's a cute and pleasant movie about a cute and pleasant girl that's one of the last remaining employees at an alleged haunted hotel that's only going to be open to guests for one more night before it's closed for good.  Nothing really happens except cute and pleasant chit-chat until the last 20 minutes and even then, it isn't particularly suspenseful or scary.  It wasn't a bad movie but it's not particularly interesting either.  Really dumb ending, one of those where you think \\"why are you going in there?\\"
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Nice game<br /><br />Well made... challenging<br />Recommended<br /><br />Beat the zombies by sending in the Samurai army... use upgrades to get more powerful
B007WFR1MQ|2.0|very disappointed, i bought the CD to support the band even though i had a feeling that it might be another repetitive album from FF.  What I didn't like:<br /><br />1. Way too much emphasis on drumming, it's like *ok we get this part* move on, change but drumming kept going on.<br />2. Too many slow dance songs!! Like WTF!! If I wanted to slow dance with my wife I would put Celine Dion or someone else!<br />3. Songs just kept repeating itself, there is no creativity.<br /><br />In my opinion the best two albums that FF put out are DEMANUFACTURE and OBSOLETE.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love this app. Someone said you couldn't get more puzzles without paying for them but you can get quite a few free puzzles. I also love that you can pick you puzzle size.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|The recording of 25th anniversary celebration of The Phantom of the Opera is a must have for any Phantom fan.  By far, Ramin Karimloo is one of the best Phantoms ever! I have been a Phantom fan since it began with Michael Crawford playing the Phantom.  I never though another performer could live up to Michael Crawford's intensity, but Ramin Karimloo did so.  This is a recording of the actual play and the play is followed with a star studded ending celebration.  All of the best known Phantoms (including Michael Crawford) are in attendance to give this once in a life time musical theater phenomena its due recognition.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|To think this is their first major release, and it's so good.  I'm not into country/bluegrass yet they pull it off so well.  A must buy.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love this app.  games are great. so much fun. could use a little more variety though. this app is totally awesome. it's one of my favorites.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I've seen some bad reviews here, but mostly due to knockoffs that have unfortunately made their way into the market.<br /><br />Rich sound, whether it's for music or vocal, or even movies.  You can hear just how trendy headphones like the Dre Beats are junkfood for the ears.<br /><br />If you have an authentic Japanese made pair, then you should already know how great these are.  I've had mine for 15 year and have recently replaced the ear padding.  I will never get another kind.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game..fun for all ages.. my grand kids are as good as I am..the challenge is in beating your best score..
B004EBT5CU|2.0|First let us not get the wrong impression, she can sing, very well.  \\"Rolling In the Deep\\" is a blatant rip off of Gnarls Barkley \\"Crazy\\", which is also a rip off in its own sense.  Once you get past that song, every other song seems to sound the same, uninspiring, boring, very typical filler songs just to push an album out.  As an artist, Adele is powered by thet social media and has caused many legit artists to be swept under the carpet.
B0086700CM|5.0|fun game...although my husband liked it too and has completed most of the objectives lol...will have to start over when he's  done.
B005QI4TP8|5.0|No sophomore slump here, this album is finely produced and even provides a better view of what Florence + The Machine are all about.  Very undefiniable genre yet they have made their vision clear.  I enjoyed Remain Nameless, What the Water Gave Me, and especially Landscape (Demo).
B0011UBDTK|5.0|I'm so glad I ordered this collection.  I had only seen the show on re-runs on TV and they had cut a lot out.  Now, I can watch it from the beginning whenever I want (gonna skip the Burger era - never liked him).
B001PB3RU8|5.0|If you wanna enjoy a new take on music without it being all about an ex-boyfriend (Adele), you will want to check Florence + The Machine.<br /><br />You will guarantee hit that \\"Previous Track\\" to listen to her songs over and over.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|My boyfriend has been telling me to read this series and i didnt do it at first. But than we watched the television series on HBO and i fell in love. This is a great series. Im on the forth book now lol. And this is the best so far.
B005GUQIDC|3.0|Usually you can get a feel for an artist from listening to the first few tracks, unfortuantely this album left us guessing every time.  You can definitely tell who produced which track, and I prefer her songs that carry a steady melody.  Her voice is excellent, but she needs to find her innervoice.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I loved this book. I have to say it is one of my favorite books!! I couldnt put it down! Sleep was the only thing that kept me from reading it but I woke up early to finish the book the next day! I plan on reading it again this week!!!
0307951529|5.0|The $100 Startup is clear, reasonable, well-researched and motivating. Too many people would love to start their own business but don't believe they have enough money. Guillebeau shows that a business can be started with a product or service you are passionate about that other people are willing to pay for, and a means of collecting their money. Often the costs to start can be handled through creative thinking and believing it's possible.<br /><br />The author discusses the theme of freedom to do what gives you the most of what you really want (money isn't always the most satisfying result) and the important theme of `giving back' to others in all that you do. He follows his own advice and presents case studies from fifty of the many companies he researched that have done similarly.
B007P6VLRS|3.0|Let's get this out there right now:  this is an extremely difficult album to 'review'.  As a Smashing Pumpkins fan for many, many years I have found that after a few listens that I am conflicted on my feelings of this album.  It's a beautifully tragic piece of work that everyone should listen to but, in my opinion, creates a disconnect with the listener that will resonate with a handful but be a significantly disjointed experience for others.  Here is my polarizing thoughts on this auditory experience:<br /><br />The Positives<br /><br />The Smashing Pumpkins have not only found a way to rediscover the true sound they have established for many years up through Adore, but have evolved that sound into a groundbreaking auditory experience.  One of the most exciting things I experienced listening to this album was how many musical 'surprises' stimulated my ears during my entire listen through.  Smashing Pumpkins have always been known for creating unique sounding songs and finding unique ways to combine different instruments and chords that results in a unique sound unlike any other but in some way or another makes sense artistically.  Billy Corgan and crew have done this again and, in my opinion have put together a brilliant sound that is compelling and has me longing to hear more.  The textures and complexities create a piece of work that had me finding new things in the song with each listen.  Billy Corgan has always excelled as an artist and this album takes his art form to a new level.  I applaud how he has not only rediscovered his former sound...but evolved it.<br /><br />The Negatives or 'Conflict'<br /><br />Everyone looks for something different in music.  For me, one of the things that allowed me to connect to the Pumpkins in years past was the ability to connect to me as a listener and to accurately convey the thoughts and feelings of the listener into a musical form.  From 'Gish' all the way through 'Adore', Smashing Pumpkins were exceptional at creating songs that would connect to us and create melodies that would haunt our minds even after listening to the album.  Sure, there are the popular songs like \\"Today\\" or \\"1979\\" that are popular examples, but songs like \\"Quiet\\"...\\"Bodies\\"... \\"Pug\\" or even \\"Ugly\\" (Aeroplane Flies High box set) and many others also had the Smashing Pumpkins ability to stick with you and connected with us as listeners.  The band always felt like they were just like us but found a way to be bigger than life and be the voice for those who felt like we were unheard.  The problem with Oceania that I faced was a complete lack of connection with Smashing Pumpkins.  These songs don't have a 'musical identity' in terms of having a true organized form/melody that will stick in your head and leave you admiring the work, but not connecting with the work.  The songs seem to lack the focus that Smashing Pumpkins had in their previous albums during their Siamese Dream/Melon Collie/Adore years as Billy seems to lack the control at times to find ways to relate to us as listener.  In short, the connection that Billy Corgan and crew had with us in the past is absent in this album which results in a work that is beautiful to behold but will leave many disconnected.  The Smashing Pumpkins are not the voice for us...but moreso themselves.  It's an existential auditory experience as they discover themselves and where you are amazed at THEIR music brilliance...but feel disconnected during the journey.  The lack of these core melodies have stripped away for me what Smashing Pumpkins so great.  Artists desperately look for new ways to inspire their audience and I applaud Smashing PUmpkins for their attempt to break new ground in their sound...but I do wish they found ways to stay grounded enough so we can connect and join them in their journey.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />I know I gave this album 3 stars...but really it's not a fair rating because, in all honesty it will be amazing for many and horrible for many.What I will say is this...Is Oceania a Brilliant auditory experience?  YES.  Is Oceania a frustrating musical experience that will leave people feeling disconnected?  YES  Regardless of my conflict, it's an album that is absolutely worth listening to.  Who knows...you may find the connection that I desperately was hoping for in the album.  I will say this album gives me hope for what could be in the future albums especially if the Smashing Pumpkins find a way to connect with us again after all these years.
B007HJ91HU|4.0|OK, so Julianne Hough stole the show.  I knew she could sing and dance like crazy, but her acting was amazing.  What a talent she is.  I'll bet Derek, her brother, could be right up there, too if he had the same opportunity.  Anyway, this is a fun remake and Dennis Quaid made a great Dad, but Julianne really stole the show.
1402545355|5.0|I loved reading the first book but when I reread it by listening to the CD, I heard so much more than I did by reading it that I listened to the rest of the series by CD.  Suddenly the 40 minute drive to work was no longer a dreaded waste of time.  The bottle-necks I ran into during rush-hour traffic meant I could enjoy the book even longer.<br /><br />I had no idea how to pronounce certain African words and when I heard how the reader Lisette Lecat spoke it, it became a complete different word than I how I spoke it in my mind.<br /><br />Even words such as \\"Khaki\\" and \\"Zebra\\" had what I assume is an African accent and endeared me even more to the characters and the book reader.  When I heard what sounds to my American ear like \\"Clark-Wayne\\" road, I realized that I had been mispronouncing \\"Tlokweng\\" Road.  Another tickle to my ear was the way the \\"M\\" in Mma was drawn out.<br /><br />I can't wait to find out what the J.L.B. in J.L.B Matekoni's name stands for.  Most of all, I hope Alexander Mccall Smith keeps this series going as well as my other favorite of his, the Isabel Dalhousie Novels.
B007NMN2US|5.0|Everything was great. Fun little item.  Item arrived promptly and with no problems. Would definitely do business with them again!
B003UPPO2G|5.0|The beginning of this concert is especially strong when they sing some of their first hits - the Bee Gees are incredible performers.  For their age in this concert, their ability to hit their notes and give a pleasing sound was a little unexpected.  Only a few times did Barry struggle hitting the higher notes in his falsetto, but it is clearly live singing and very impressive.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I read this trilogy on the recommendation of my 41 year old younger sister and my 65 year old mother.  I couldn't wait to finish the last two books.  \\"It's not a romance\\" I was told by my sister, but soon found out I was lied to.  What a disappointment.  I was expecting a little more substance to this, but found the writing repetitive and boring.  The main character was annoying, insecure and just plain unnerving (the virgin who falls for the first man she sleeps with) and the storyline overall had more valleys than peaks and was very unbelieveable.<br /><br />I can deal with a little sex and romance in the books that I read, but this was overkill to the point that I was getting tired reading about it.  The only thing I got out of the books were great ideas on how to spice up things with the guy I married.  Other than that, it was two weeks wasted.

1469984202|5.0|The Wool series was my first dip into the Hugh Howey pool.  Good move.  I have come to be suspicious of inexpensive books, not that there are not some very good ones out there, but it seems that too many times I have gone for the flashy cover or interesting premise only to find that's about all you get for your 2.99.  Howey was a breath of fresh air - a real artist with words. He has a natural style that never gets between the story and the reader - you don't have to stop and reflect on awkward phrasing or illiteracies and misspellings.<br /><br />I bought my first Kindle as a early adopter, delighted to see how seamlessly Amazon spread the  reader to the iphone and later the ipad, where I now do most of my reading. Howey has realized a vision I had for Kindle books from the beginning - a self-published work that was in every way competitive with any published work out there.  The man can write circles around Stephen King, in my opinion, and I predict a great career, whether he self-publishes or goes with the whole retinue of publisher/agent, which he evidently has decided to do.  One of my pet peeves with Amazon is how rapidly the price of Kindle volumes escalated after initial adoption, to the point that they were pricing e-books higher than dead tree issues.  There seemed to be a great deal of push-back on that front, but when I read the history of \\"Wool\\" it gave me a great feeling to see someone who could really write making a go of it in indie publishing.  I have loaded up my iPad with the Howey oeuvre to date anticipating some very good reading to come.  Here's hoping Mr. Howey lives long and prospers.[[ASIN:B0071XO8RA Wool Omnibus Edition (Wool 1 - 5)]]

B002UD56I6|5.0|Unbelievable & memorable ... Having spent 25 years as a DJ in nightclubs starting in the 70's I went through the whole MJ ritual of playing 'Billie Jean' over and over for the club crowd ... Now at the age of 60 I picked up this DVD per chance and was taken back immediately to a era of dance and feel good vibes ... this man at the age of 50 blows away any performer who has survived the era of dance and rhythm ... the fact that he could still produce the sounds and was particularly exacting about what the fans would hear brought a brand new respect for Michael as an artist ... forget the hoopla surrounding his offstage antics and become enthralled with a true artist ... believe me all you unbelievers out there, there's no one in this era of music that compares ... I feel hopeful that this DVD wins more fans and gives the man the respect that he so deserves

0316044938|4.0|I had to see what all of the hype was about- also the movie is coming out and I had to read the book first.<br /><br />This was really good. I found that I was crying in a couple different of places. This was a great read. It goes fast because you don't want to put it down. I didn't want to read it at first because I thought that it might be graphic and I don't care for detailed murders and whatnot... but it wasn't. It was told in the eyes of a 14 year old and it was the perfect amount of information.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone. It is very compelling and makes you want to grab your loved ones and hold on to them forever.<br /><br />Great read.<br /><br />From the back cover:<br /><br />My name was Salmon, like the fish, first name, Susie. I was fourteen when I was murdered on December 6, 1973. My murderer was a man from our<br />neighborhood. My mother liked his border flowers, and my father talked<br />to him once about fertilizer'<br /><br />This is Susie Salmon, speaking to us from heaven. It looks a lot like her school playground, with the<br />good kind of swing sets. There are counsellors to help newcomers to<br />adjust, and friends to room with. Everything she wants appears as soon<br />as she thinks of it - except the thing she wants most: to be back with<br />the people she loved on earth.
0440224764|1.0|This book was almost nothing but backstory filled in via conversations and testemony by various characters.  Almost nothing actually happens in this book.  you can read the first quarter and the last quarter and really miss nothing.  There was no suspence and the protagonist was so flat I kept wishing he had died during the torture in Brazil.  Skip this book even if you get it for free.
1595141979|5.0|Okay, I won't continue to obsess with Richelle Mead like I did in the previous post \\"Storm Born\\", but I just have to say this.... I freaking love her. Don't tell Charlene Harris that I said that, bc I feel like I am cheating on her when I say that, but it is kind of true. Yeah, Sookie is great, but what has Charlene done for me lately??!!! One Sookie book a year... now Richelle Mead is fabulous and there are three different series that I am reading right now....<br /><br />With that being said, I love the Vampire Academy Novels! They are a little teenagerish, if you can even say that, but I still like it. I read this book in one day and I looooooove fast reads so this really hits the spot. This was the third of the series and I cannot wait to continue reading. I am thinking that I am more of a series person just because it makes me feel better when I know that I continue reading about the same characters for years.<br /><br />So, I just loved this and I would recommend this to anyone.<br /><br />On the Back Cover:<br /><br />Rose Hathaway knows it is forbidden to love another guardian. Her best friend, Lissa, the last Dragomir princess, ust always come first. Unfortunately, when it comes to gorgeous Dimitri Belikov, some rules are meant to be broken...<br /><br />But since making her first Strigoi kills, Rose hasn't been feeling right. Something dark has begun to grow in her mind, and ghostly shadows worn of a terible evil drawing nearer to the Academy's iron gates. And now that Lissa and Rose's sworn enemy, Victor Dashkov, is on trial for his freedom, tensions in the Moroi world are higher than ever.<br /><br />Lying to Lissa about Dimitri is one thing, but suddenly there's way more than friendship at stake. The immortal undead are on the prowl, and they want vengeance for the lives that Rose has stolen. In a heartstopping battle to rival her worst nightmares, Rose will have to choose between life, love, and the two people who matter most...but will her choice mean that only one can survive?that only one can survive?
B005IQZB14|4.0|I have spent a lot of time in the wilderness, hiking and rafting so I very much enjoyed the subject matter.

B0083GR6Y6|5.0|Of course I love Liam Neison in anything he does and this movie was gripping.  Go ahead and watch it and I think you will agree.
B007P6VLRS|4.0|First off, let me start that I think it's unfair when a songwriter is criticized for making music that doesn't sound like their \\"old stuff.\\" Great songwriters are constantly evolving and make write music that may alienate their fan base. This record is being held up to an unfair standard because D'arcy, Iha and Chamberlain are no longer in the band. Let's get something straight: The Smashing Pumpkins have always been Billy Corgan, and always will be. It's harsh, but for the most part, any other band members have just been \\"window dressing\\" for Corgan's vision.<br /><br />\\"Zeitgeist\\" was rightfully criticized because it was an overly aggressive mess of a record where Corgan seemed liked he was trying to cater to fans of the band who thought that Zwan and his solo record weren't \\"angsty\\" enough. \\"Teargarden\\" was better, but it seemed at times that Corgan was trying too hard to please the fans who wanted \\"Gish and \\"Siamese Dream.\\" Corgan was trying to move the Pumpkins sound forward, but was befuddled by trying to please fans of the band's \\"old sound,\\" and who missed the old members of the band.<br /><br />They say that great art is born out of conflict, and it seems that Corgan, with \\"Oceania\\" has successfully recaptured the \\"old\\" Pumpkins sound while adding some new touches to it. To give a reference point for familiarity's sake, imagine the optimism of Zwan with the keyboard epics on \\"Mellon Collie.\\" Add in the wistful psychedelia of \\"Teargarden,\\" and you have this record.<br /><br />However, unlike \\"Teargarden,\\" this record sounds confident, as Corgan seems like he put together a collection of songs that were worthy of the \\"Smashing Pumpkins\\" moniker. It's definitely not their best album, but it is unique in their discography because it does not have an immediate single that grabs the listener. This forces the listener to take in the album as a whole, even though it has peaks and valleys.<br /><br />These valleys come at the beginning and end of the album. \\"Quasar\\"is a pretty formulaic Pumpkins song that comes across as tired and plodding. \\"Panopticon\\" is another rocker that attempts to add the new \\"Teargarden\\" sound to the formula. It is better than the first song because of the chorus, but still plodding nonetheless.<br /><br />I was pretty worried that this album would fall into the same trap as \\"Zeitgeist,\\" but \\"The Celestials\\" proved my fears were unfounded. It is a great song that starts out as an acoustic guitar and keyboard ballad, and then builds up to a crescendo of the great layered guitar \\"Pumpkins sound.\\" \\"Violet Rays\\" is another keyboard driven number that allows new drummer Mike Byrne to show that he is a more than competent replacement for Jimmy Chamberlain.<br /><br />\\"My Love is Winter\\" and \\"One Diamond. One Heart\\" both have great hooks and keyboard work.<br /><br />\\"Pinwheels,\\" no kidding, is probably one of the best songs that Corgan has written this past decade. It is an epic song has everything that makes him a great songwriter. It is a great progressive rock number that establishes a main hook with more guitars and keyboard and then goes off into a completely new direction with more great guitar work and sweet female backing vocals.<br /><br />The title track is more progressive rock at progressive rock length: nine minutes. It has more great guitar work by Corgan. \\"Pale Horse\\" is a pretty ballad that is catchy, as well.<br /><br />An argument can be made that \\"The Chimera\\" falls into the same trap of generic ness as the first two songs on the album, but Corgan uses the glorious \\"Pumpkins Sound\\" to an overwhelming effect here, creating a very memorable and recognizable rocker.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that is the last good song on the record. The last three songs would be good as b-sides, but nothing more. \\"Glissandra\\" and \\"Wildflower\\" sound like Corgan has given up at this point, as they simply sound like unfinished demos that don't quite go anywhere. \\"Inkless\\" is the best of the three, but not quiteup to par with the fantastic middle section of the album.<br /><br />Even though I gripe about a few of the songs on this album, I can see that it is one of those that you may have to listen to a few times before you realize how great it is. There's no question that songs 3 through 10 are worth buying this album. In a few years I may realize that the entire album may be five stars, but for now, it's a competent return to form for Corgan and his rotating cast of Smashing Pumpkins.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|You just can't beat this classic.  Do it again Sam and watch it!  Great performances by great one of a kind actors.  Enjoy again.
B008578H9G|5.0|And so did I. I thought it was a brilliant, fitting end to the series. That said, if you like action more than talk, this may not turn out to be among your House favorites. There is a LOT of talk, and most of the important action happens towards the end.<br /><br />I like TV shows that could just as well have been written as scripts for live theater... because I am disgustingly pretentious and un-American like that. I believe most anyone who has been watching House regularly for any sustained period of time will at least enjoy watching this, as it is (after all) the final episode, and possibly also because it happens to be very good.<br /><br />Goodbye, Gregory House. We hardly knew ye.
0312641893|5.0|Oh MAN!<br /><br />I let my friends have a look at my NetGalley review list and asked what book I should read next. I immediately got several \\"CINDER!\\" responses (most notably from Hobbitsies), and even though the cover kind of scared me off at first (I'm not a science fiction person generally, and as you can see there is a little robot piece there), I decided to take the recommendation and go with it.<br /><br />WOWOWOWOW<br /><br />I should have originally looked at this one closer because it's a fairy tale retelling, which intrigues me quite a bit. The only other retelling I've read is Sisters Red by Jackson Pearce (which I also loved), so this may be a good sub genre for me to keep an eye on.<br /><br />My favorite part of Cinder is that it's not hard to get into the story. Yes yes, it is a retelling kind of based in science fiction, in a different world, but it all flows so seamlessly that I never found myself rereading a section to understand what was going on. And this is a big feat for a reader such as myself, because I can get confused quite easily.<br /><br />On top of that, Cinder is a great protagonist. She is smart, slightly impulsive, emotional. Realistic. Well, besides the cyborg part. But you know what I mean.<br /><br />The world that Marissa Meyer created is superb. And though Cinder is based on Cinderella, it's not so closely knit that you know exactly what is going to happen - in fact, there were very few scenes I was able to predict.<br /><br />Lunar Chronicles #2 keeps following the story of Cinder, but is named Scarlet and apparently is based on Red Riding Hood. Can we say possibly one of the most epic series ever? A continuing protagonist with different fairy tale focuses?!? WHAT!<br /><br />I really loved this debut. Cinder is a character I loved reading about, and I can't wait to read more.
0765316994|5.0|The title caught my attention.  I remember STAR TREK and read my share of fan fiction, so \\"Redshirt\\" is a term I know well.  So I had to check out the description.  And once I read the description I decided to give the book a try.  Hey, it's summer and I need some summer reading material.<br /><br />I got home from work and found the book waiting for me.  I fed the cats, myself, and decided to just check the book out a bit, figuring I would actually sit down and start reading it on the weekend.<br /><br />At 1 AM I forced myself to put it down and turn the lights out because I had work this morning.<br /><br />The book is a truly excellent read.  Scalzi knows his material and knows how to write a book that pulls you in and keeps you immersed.  I love the premise, the plot, the setting, the characters, everything.<br /><br />This one is going on my list of potential Christmas gifts, because I know many of my friends would love it as much as I do.  The only problem is I probably can't wait until December to tell them about it so they'll probably be getting their own copies well before then.
B000PKX2KA|4.0|I bought this GPS for use in combination with Polarview NS on a Macbook for navigation on my sailboat. The driver install went smoothly on OSX Snow Leopard 10.6.8 using updated drivers from the US Globalsat website. Once the receiver was plugged in, Polarview picked it up automatically.<br /><br />For the receiver to be as accurate as posible, it needs to see an open sky in all directions. When the receiver was sitting stationary inside my house next to a window, my position drifted around in a 30-40 foot diameter circle with occasional jumps out to 50 feet from the center. In this configuration, the indicated speed in the nav software kept jumping from 0.0 to 0.5 knots.<br /><br />With the receiver sitting on the roof of my boat while on the trailer and with a clear sky in all directions, the position stayed within a 20 foot diameter circle with no jumps. The speed stayed locked at 0.0 the whole time.<br /><br />All tests were performed with data dampening set one click to the right from Off.<br /><br />The cord that came with the receiver is decently long but I would recommend getting a USB extension cable if you're setting up like me with the receiver on the roof and the laptop down below on the chart table.

I look forward to reading more from this author.

B0082209TK|3.0|** 1/2<br /><br />\\"Bel Ami\\" aspires to be a period drama that explores privileged people using marriage, romance, and sex in order to social climb, make money, or sometimes just inflict emotional damage on their enemies. Films like \\"Dangerous Liaisons,\\" \\"The Age of Innocence\\" and even the recent \\"Cheri\\" have all mined similar territory with, unfortunately, far superior results.<br /><br />Robert Pattison plays Georges, a soldier from a poor background who uses his looks and charm to burrow his way into Paris' aristocratic society via seducing and bedding powerful women. His first conquest is a wife of a wealthy businessman (Christina Ricci); his second, the wife of his boss at the newspaper he works, Madeleine (Uma Thurman, giving the film's best performance by far); his third, the wife of the newspaper's publisher (a wasted Kristen Scott Thomas, whom he beds not because he even finds her attractive, but as an act of pure revenge) and finally, the publisher's daughter (whom he marries out of pure strategy).<br /><br />\\"The most important people in Paris are not the men. It's the women,\\" advises Madeleine. Madeleine quickly emerges as the smartest and shrewdest character in the film. Due to her gender, she's been forced to learn to influence and manipulate behind-the-scenes, however, she is also not above brutal honesty when appropriate. When her husband dies and Georges proposes marriage, she tells him \\"I am not like other women. I will not tolerate authority, jealousy, or you questioning my behavior.\\" Georges marries her anyway, but she wears the pants in the relationship, and doesn't let him forget it for a moment. In fact, the more wealth and superficial success Georges attains, the more enraged the character becomes, as the various people around him seem to delight in constantly reminding him that he is, in essence, nothing more than a glorified gigolo.<br /><br />Georges, as a character, is supposed to be ruthless, charming, not terribly intelligent, and hopelessly out of his depth much of the time. Unfortunately, Robert Pattison as an actor is in the same boat. His performance isn't terrible, but when compared to charismatic and experienced actresses like Uma Thurman, Christina Ricci, and Kristen Scott Thomas, he comes across as an amateur. And since the film depends so much on his performance, and the film's script and direction are merely adequate, the film itself ends up mediocre.ssly out of his depth much of the time.

0345803485|1.0|So I just finished 50 Shades of Grey....And I have to say that this book was a complete waste of space on my Kindle!! What in the world would lead so many to believe that this is a great book, it's awful. And it's not even Skinemax awful, this was like reading a Sear's catalogue for porn. If I had to read about biting a lip or blushing one more time, I would have chucked the book out a window...can't do that sadly I like my Kindle way to much! The characters are unbelievable and unrealistic. It was like reading an S&M book written by a 16 year old. The story and situations are completely ridiculous. I'm sorry but it's a lot harder to please a woman or a man then this book makes it out to be. If you are looking for an entertaining read look elsewhere.

0393338398|3.0|[...]    I was a huge fan of  Michael Lewis' book called The Big Short, which made sense since I have a background in finance. I also thought the movie The Blind Side (also by Lewis) was a very inspiring . So naturally, my expectation of the book Moneyball was:  \\"this would be great!\\", but instead it was more \\"yea it was ok\\", which equates to probably a 7 out of 10 rating.    The 7/10 rating was because I ignored  2  important facts.    First, I don't know anything about baseball!!! Hmm, this should have been a big red flag to start with. I've watched one college baseball game and I thought it was really boring.    Second, Michael Lewis is a numbers guy. His background is in MA. Economics, and worked as bonds salesman in a Wall Street investment bank.    The whole book is about how a baseball team, Oakland A's, with one of the smallest yearly budget can stay competitive against the big spenders like the Yankees or the Red Sox. And this \\"how\\" is explained almost solely using baseball statistics, so naturally not knowing anything about baseball really doesn't help with reading the book. The book is heavy with baseball terminology, history, statistics,  names, and etc. For someone who really doesn't follow the sport, it would be really  hard to follow what a .300 batting average is.    Furthermore, Lewis' being a numbers guy becomes very clear in the book. Like I said before, the book is filled with statistical analysis of everything related to baseball game. He also manages to bring in a lot of comparison of baseball to wall street stock trading, which clearly shows where his influence comes from.    So unfortunately my expectation was that this book would portray Oakland A's success story in more of a novel like story line, with some inspiring twist. Instead, the book is very quantitative and sectioned. Essentially each chapter mentions how the Oakland A's found or traded players that nobody wanted based on some baseball statistics.    I think the most disappointingpart of the book is the ending. Ok, so they end up with a new record in the season with the most consecutive wins (20 wins in a row), and end up in the playoffs, but they end up sucking at the playoffs, which they attribute to luck! Yes, I said luck. So the whole book spends time on how this underdog team does well because they use pure statistical science, and they end up coming up with \\"luck\\" as an excuse for why they did poorly in the play-offs.    Ok, so I've been pretty negative about the book so far, but I did give it a 7/10, which is not bad.  Lewis still does tell a great story, and I did start getting the hang of baseball terminology and stats as I kept reading. I'm also a numbers guy (finance background), so it was interesting to see how the statistical analyses were used to evaluate a sport like baseball. Also,  although it wasn't The Blind Side inspirational, there were few stories of  inspiring baseball players.    Overall, I think this book is perfect if you are a baseball fanatic, or you are into fantasy baseball, which it talks about a lot. Otherwise, I'd recommend that you keep looking for a book that is geared towards your interest.

0345803485|1.0|I read this book on vacation because I thought, hmmm, can't be that bad. Wrong. I agree with the other reviewers who have called it juvenile, repetitive, childish, boring, unrealistic, etc. and don't need to go into further detail than has already been so eloquently mentioned.  However, I do have to give kudos to the reviewer who said this book read like a hoax by a 10th grader!! I find it unbelievable that the American public is eating these books like candy.  Did Oprah tell them to?  While the similarity to the Twilight novels (refuse to read) has been noted, what no one has mentioned is the plethora of good literature out there in which the S/M culture/lifestyle is discussed much more realistically and intelligently. Ladies, it's not about the billionaire, handsome, knight in shining armor who likes to tie your hands above your head and bumps your airline seat up to first class.  If you're really interested in S/M, try reading Pat Califia or any of the number of serious writers who acurately portray this subject matter because they live it.  Fifty Shades is nothing more than a good old fashioned \\"bodice ripper\\" and a very poorly written one at that.

Arriving there, she's befriended by Diego Bonata, a young hottie with aspirations as a singer/songwriter/rock star, who gets her a job as a waitress at the Bourbon Club.  Tom Cruise comes out of hibernation to play Stacee Jaxx, a rock legend whose reputation is eclipsed only by his ego.  Cruise is good, but at times seems to be in a different movie: his demeanor stays smolderingly dour, while everyone else's is resolutely chipper.  Alec Baldwin plays the owner of the on-the-skids Bourbon Club, which gave Stacee his first break, and Russell Brand plays himself (at which he is rather good).  Paul Giamatti plays  Stacee's slimy manager, and the other bad guy is Catherine Zeta-Jones, a Tipper Gore-like figure, who is leading a protest against music that \\"rapes\\" today's youngsters.  In the end, of course, the power of rock and roll proves the ultimate healer and unites friend and foe alike.<br /><br />\\"Rock of Ages,\\" is an equal opportunity offender; its targets include feminists, homophobes, and people with discerning musical taste.  Based on a musical, it does have very important messages about censorship, following your dream despite discouragement, etc., but they aren't hammered home, and you can just enjoy the music, and snicker at the Tonka Truck sized cells, abundance of acid wash and mousse abuse.  Mary J. Blige has a small role, too, and seems to be enjoying herself, although after hearing her, it's too bad that she's too old to play the Hough role.  In all, it's decent summer entertainment.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I feel bad that John Carter didn't do better at the box office.  It was a beautiful, fun movie that you can watch with the whole family.  I hope more people pick it up on DVD and give it a shot for themselves.
B007T2XC7A|3.0|Well I thought the CD was good but maybe a bit different from the Past Norah Jones!!! its good,,  could just be me but I enjoy listening to it and glad I bought it !!!!!!!!!!!
B0000714BP|3.0|I saw this movie years ago and laugh my butt off. To  see 3 ICONS dressed as DRAG QUEENS was so funny, I ordered it for my niece to see.  We sat there and laugh and laugh at them.  A must see for anyone who needs a good laugh.

0060533773|5.0|This is one of those books that you don't want to put down until you have finished it.  It captivates you.  The story is simple, but it really makes you think about a  lot of things going on in your life and also in other's lives. It is very easy to read, but it is a book that you will treasure for the rest of your life once you have read it. One of my all time favorites.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Just what I  wanted! Great graphics, very clear. Works great on my tablet. Can play while waiting for an appointment where it is too distracting to read. Very relaxing! Best I have found. Can't beat the price (except free) ;-)
B007ZKY7XO|4.0|Hello I purchased this album as a single disc format.  Does anyone know if there is a 2 disc special edition or a special edition that plays the video and behind the scenes footage without having to go to the Scissor Sister website?  Amazon lists the video and behind the scenes as tracks however, the picture of the disc they show displays bonus content online only?  Please help....are there multiple special editions?<br />As far as the album is concerned, this is classic Scissor Sisters.  The song with San Juan in the title is a nice trip to a tropical wonderland gone bad...very fun.  I loved their first album, dreaded \\"Tah Dah\\" and loved \\"Night Work\\" which had me coming back for \\"Magic Hour.\\"  With that in mind I would rank this one as just a tad more enjoyable than \\"Tah Dah.\\"  He uses that Bee Gees inspired voice a lot which tends to have me rolling my eyes after a while.  There are lots of tracks though and it is a fun listen.  I'm interested in getting feedback on the special edition.  Please post lots of comments.

B007P6VLRS|1.0|that about says it all...I was a huge SP fan until Billy reformed the group and made that pathetic record a few years ago. At least Zwan was a half decent band. This guy is a fading star who's grasping at straws. Retire with dignity, do something different. All the great bands knew to call it quits when they were on top.
B007VTVGAQ|5.0|A Remarkable album on every single musical level. With this album Fiona Apple captures the greatest break-up album we will ever hear. Every one of this albums 10 tracks is remarkable and each song will leave an indelible imprint in your mind forever. Its not often that an album with this much hype live's up to all the anticipation, but it most certainly does. Its the album that will remain strong forever. It will never get week. It will always be able to be played and its verver will resonate in your heart whenever you need to feel the love of great music. I give this album a 10 out of 10 as it will certainly be in my top 10 albums of 2012 list. My words cannot express enough how worthwhile it is to experience this album right this very second!<br /><br />I had the chance to see her perform in a small club before she hit it big and got a meet and greet as well. I swear we locked eyes and she gave me a flirty smile that could just melt ya. Her music is so beautiful and fun at the same time. Her music will always give me great memories!
B000002KB8|5.0|This record started it all for heavy metal music. The haunting lyrics and legendary guitar riffs never get old. These are matched by the out of this world bass and incredible drums. Not many records stay relevant for over 40 years, this is one of them! If you are a fan of music then this is a must own.

B001O54NL2|5.0|Christopher Cross' self-titled debut is a great album, and easily his best. Unlike the ballad-heavy follow-up, ANOTHER PAGE, and the more hard-rock-oriented third album, EVERY TURN OF THE WORLD, this CD is musically varied, moving from the rocker \\"Ride Like The Wind\\", which still gets airplay on some classic rock radio stations, to the dreamy ballad \\"Sailing\\", this album is great for people like myself who are moving away from hard rock towards more melodic sounds. This album may not have been hip, but it's memorable.
B004HW7JH4|5.0|After putting its' viewers through an 18-month hiatus, a show has to be pretty outstanding on every level not to disappoint.  I was anxious to see whether Season Five would be able to keep me ensnared after all that time.  And, I'm happy to say, I found Season Five to be everything I could have hoped for.<br /><br />The very handsome ladies' man, Don Draper, also possibly one of the most fascinating characters I've ever watched in any genre, seems in Season Five to have finally matured into a decent husband and family man.  With perky wife No. 2, Megan, he seems determined not to make the same mistakes he made with the gorgeous but grim-faced Betty.  Megan, a much more headstrong and modern version of Eve, tests his patience on several levels, while showing that beneath the sixties' glam-girl facade she is very much his equal in wanting her own way (and is pretty good at getting it).  The cast of characters at Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce are much the same, all vying for power, with Machiavellian Pete grasping for more than his share whenever possible.  Joan, everyone's favorite redhead, pulls some surprising moves that solidify her role at the company, while shaking off some of her more suffocating ties.  Peggy never disappoints in her role as the evolving career woman, and as for the rest...well, you'll just have to keep watching, because the drama is truly gripping.<br /><br />One thing I always admire about this show is that the plot moves along effortlessly, without some unbelievable event to push it in the right direction.  Everything in the show is nuanced and layered, as in real life, and if something tragic or wonderful happens, it seems to fit naturally in the course of events.  Weiner is fascinated, as always, by marriage, adultery, and moral issues, which are thankfully never resolved in a pat manner.  Glamorous as the characters in \\"Mad Men\\" look, they are nevertheless wrestling with the same things that challenge all of us -- mortgages, children, money, temptation, ambition.<br /><br />Two things remained with me after watching the entire season.  One was the amazing acting ability of Kiernan Shipka, the actress who plays Sally Draper, and the other was the very last scene of Episode 12.  Can't wait for Season Six!, temptation, ambition.<br /><br />Two things remained with me after watching the entire season.

B001MCYZJC|5.0|From top to bottom this record is a heavy metal masterpiece. The great Dio, rest his soul, is a powerhouse. His lyrics and voice blend perfectly with the band's outstanding instrumentals. Sure there is no Ozzy, but believe me, you will not regret getting this record. 10/10

B00000J2PH|5.0|Carole King's TAPESTRY is a true classic that features many great songs. In addition to this version, there's also a double-disc version that features live versions with just Carole at the piano. However, this version features two bonus tracks not on the 2-CD version. That means that in order to get the full picture, you'll need both versions. However, the single-disc version is still the perfect comfort for when you're having a hard day.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Just finished this trilogy - it's got to be the best thing I've EVER read. I actually read it twice! I saw the movie first, not knowing anything about it, now I'm hooked. And I'm not a kid, I'm a 64 year old grandmother. This is the first thing I've read of this author and it's unbelievable. A MUST-READ for any age. She's a genius.
B00138H6OG|5.0|You just cannot go wrong with Slayer. This album kills it from top to bottom. Tom's awesome lyrics and passion for the music ooze out of every song. The guitar riffs are as legendary as ever. Just get this record and enjoy it, you will not be sad that you did. Hail Slayer!
B002ZG99TA|5.0|----------------------------------------<br />Public service announcement before I begin review.  Toonami is back!!!  Airs on Saturday Midnight, well technically Sunday, from 12:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m., with an encore beginning at 3:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.  Tune in and support it.  Now on to my review.<br />----------------------------------------<br /><br />**Brief Review**<br /><br />I actually remember this happening years ago when I was in the 9th grade.  We were discussing it in class.  This happened roughly 10 years before the film 'Unstoppable' hit theaters.  I am not sure how accurate the movie is to the real life event, probably a LITTLE amped up.  Still, a runaway train is a runaway train, and that's BAD no matter how you slice it.<br /><br />This film is EXTREMELY simple in it's story.  The fat brother from 'My Name Is Earl' jumps off a moving train to re-align some tracks, then he's too out of shape to get back on it.  It takes off down the tracks, un-maned and picking up speed with every mile.<br /><br />Enter Denzel Washington and Chris Pine, Denzel's the veteran conductor and Pine is the new recruit starting his first day.  Both are fated to be the ones to try and stop this moving monster before it destroys an entire town.<br /><br />As I said the story is pretty simple.  But a simple story is NOT a bad thing.  Sometimes a good action movie is just what the doctor ordered.  Sometimes a more character/story driven film such as 'The King's Speech' is needed.  FYI, I just saw 'The King's Speech' and it definitely lived up to the all the hype I've heard.<br /><br />Long story short...Denzel and Chris stop the train, minimal deaths, minimal damage.  I have an especially soft spot for this film.  Back when I managed the video store, I must have listened to this thing play like 50 times...it was good to listen to while I worked.<br /><br />--To Buy Or Not To Buy?--<br /><br />Big question, should you buy this?  If the price is 8 bucks and below, pop on this.  Any higher and I would say pass.  There are no extras, just the action packed film.  I bought mine for 4.99 (used) and would recommend you shoot for this range.  While this is a good film, it's not worth a fortune.  You could always stream it or rent it as well I guess...it may be on network tv soon as well.<br /><br />Well that's my 2 cents worth.  Now if you'll excuse me I need to MOVE, I'm typing this review on some train tracks and it looks like the train is coming!!!higher and I would say pass.

B0087240Z4|4.0|I'm 35 and grew up with this band. I watched their rise and what seemed their fall, and some of my fondest memories involve SP concerts and music. I loved the Pumpkins for their dreamy, transcendent, and defiantly personal sound. There was an angelic, fragile and shamelessly sensitive quality to most everything they did, coupled with guitars that could roar and snarl at anyone and everything, crescendos of drums that rocketed you to the  clouds, and screeching howls that sent you hurtling back to earth.<br /><br />The last pumpkins album I bought was in 2000. It was their greatest hits. This marked the first time I purchased a greatest hits album, and it was, I assumed, the last pumpkins album I would ever buy. I did not care for the machines of glass, or the increasingly dissonant direction Billy seemed to be going in.<br /><br />I bought this album after listening to the opening cut of Quasar. As I listened to it in its entirety I felt that sly wink, that warm knowing, that feeling that I'd found a secret that the Pumpkins always gave me.<br /><br />There are angelic assaults (Quasar), wistful remembrances (Pale Horse), heroic transcendence (Panopticon), shamlessly personal declarations of friendship and love (The Celestials, One Diamond/One Heart), and dreamy childhood bliss (Pinwheels) all cut with the snarling guitars that serve as Corgan's dogs of war.<br /><br />That being said, this is not simply Mellon Collie or Gish pt 2. This is a new album with new sounds. Acoustic guitar, bass, electric guitar and electronic synth blend into an organic, natural whole, and a beautiful one at that

0071762345|5.0|I bought this book a little while ago and it changed my life forever. I truly feel as though I found a profession that matched my skills and that could have only been brought to light by the encouraging words, helpful tips, and creative insight of \\"Likeable Social Media\\".<br />What could make someone so geek-ed about an informative book like \\"Likeable Social Media\\"? Besides from the awesome suggestions and amusing anecdotes, Dave actually practices what he preaches. The moment I tweeted how much I enjoyed his book, he retweeted my tweet, and then directly responded thanking me for the comment! It made me feel good and if his methods make ME feel good, I hope to make my clients feel good the same way. Thank you Dave Kerpen!
B005WMADYE|4.0|----------------------------------------<br />Public service announcement before I begin review.  Toonami is back!!!  Airs on Saturday Midnight, well technically Sunday, from 12:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m., with an encore beginning at 3:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.  Tune in and support it.  Now on to my review.<br />----------------------------------------<br /><br />**Brief Review Of Anime**<br /><br />Bought this from FYE for 9.99, marked down from 22.95!!!  Quite a deal.  I have been wanting to watch this for some time and now I finally have.<br /><br />Do you have to like racing to like this Anime?  No, in fact I HATE racing.  I have never watched Nascar in my life.  And I live in West Virginia, where Nascar and beer are almost prerequisites to live here, that and 'Dukes of Hazard'.  No, my reader you do not have to like racing to like this movie.  You do though have to be a fan of Anime, as this is one of the more stranger ones...<br /><br />**Some Spoilers Ahead**<br /><br />The film centers around \\"Sweat JP\\", a human racecar driver.  He is one of the few humans in the movie.  The rest of the characters are aliens, cyborgs, etc.  While all other racers drive weird things, like rocket cars, hover-crafts, and robots, Sweat JP drives a trans-am.  Wow those things really hold up... It's actually neat to see one normal looking vehicle in the movie.<br /><br />The racing in the movie is like watching 'Death Race' meets 'Speed Racer', while droping acid.  When Sweat JP starts to go really fast the screen will stretch and distort.  This movie is quite a trip to watch, and I was sober when I watched it.  I can only imagine what watching it drunk would be like.  I'll try that on my 2nd watch of it.<br /><br />Anyway, by a stroke of luck JP is eligable to enter the Redline, the most ruthless race in the galaxy.  Taking place on Roboworld, the race is practically suicide, Roboworld vows to kill all racers who come to the planet.<br /><br />Sweat JP has more problems than this though.  He and his partner are in debt to the mafia and JP routinely throws races in order that the mob can place fixed bets and win big.  So not only does he have the cyborgs of Roboworld riding his ass, he also has the space mafia on his back like a monkey as well.<br /><br />The film only gets stranger from here.  Funkyboy, a toxic weapon of some kind breaks out causing havoc.  This coupled with many other things make the race quite an edge on your seat experience.<br /><br />--Pros--<br /><br />Good animation.  Racing is actually exciting to watch, not dull at all.  Some fan service for the guys.  Sonoshee, a female racer, is topless for like 5 minutes, tee-hee...<br /><br />--Cons--<br /><br />Fan service.  While I like a naked lady as much as the next guy, this scene was totally out of place.  No reason why she's watching tv naked, she's just doing it.  This kind of knocks a film/movie down a peg when this stuff happens.<br /><br />Weird factor.  Funkyboy, the cosplay racers, machinehead, the list goes on of weird things in this movie.  Eventually you just have to accept you are watching one of those weird Animes and quit trying to figure things out.<br /><br />I personally thought Sweat JP's hair looked stupid.  He looks like Brad Pitt from 'Johnny Suede'.  That's not a good look.<br /><br />--In Conclusion--<br /><br />Really good Anime.  I plan to give this a 2nd view very soon.  While this Anime is weird at times, it does stay on track and delivers quite a thrilling ride for us the viewers.<br /><br />Is it worth buying?  Yes, I say it is.  But this is a hardcore Anime, so if you are not into Anime, or have just dabeled in it, you make not like it.  This film is going for a decent price on Amazon right now.  If your near an FYE, check there, it could still be on sale for 9.99 new!!!<br /><br />Well, that's my thoughts.  Now if you'll excuse me I am going to go buy myself a trans-am and start street racing.  On second thought I'll just watch 'Redline' again...e and his partner are in debt to the mafia and JP routinely throws races in order that the mob can place fixed bets and win big.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|The love story is great and the first book I couldn't put down waiting for the plot to develop.  I DID NOT KNOW what the book was about when I purchased the first book.  I did not have prior knowledge with the Red Room procedures and found them a little hard to believe.  However, the love story was great and I loved the 'inner goddess and subconscious' comments in the story.  I admit I glossed over many of the sex scenes.  I don't like violence and even tho it was consensual it was hard for me to read.  I felt it was well written by a very intelligent writer--can't imagine the research that was done!
B004Y1WCDE|1.0|If you are buying this app for Kindle Fire, please read the reviews here!  The app's poor video playback on the device makes it basically unusable.  Even if you set the video bitrate as high as possible (4+ megabits) it will not playback smoothly.<br /><br />On a better note, Amazon was great about refunding my money with no hassles.
B004K4IZ3G|2.0|I had heard a lot about this movie, and was quite excited when I saw it go on sale, so I picked it up, and wish I hadn't. The special effects are beautiful (hence not giving it a 1 star rating) but the plot is so boring. Acting is great, and really everything about the movie was fine, but I found myself having a difficult time staying focused on the movie, and my family, with whom I was watching with, felt the same way. None of us had seen the original film from the '80s, but we were told it wasn't necessary and that we'd \\"Catch right on.\\" There must've been something in the original we needed to know, because now we have another blu-ray sitting on the shelf that will never be watched again. At least I purchased it on sale...
B007L3BMGA|2.0|Yeah - not moved by this. I know the hype. But if you have read Anais Nin or any other of the classic erotic pieces, this just feels so ... cheap porn. If anyone bit their lip and said \\"Holy Cow\\" that much - no one would date them, let alone a rich, handsome guy. It is contrived and appeals in the way that naughty books did back in your early teens. Its not big-girl erotic fiction.

B004UG7RQ0|3.0|As my title states, this product does work with my AVIC-Z2 and has been working fine for a few months until now when it will occasionally cut out most of the signal if the headphone jack isn't plugged in \\"how it likes it.\\" you have to spin it around a bit and jossel the cord a bit and then it sounds fine. You need to be aware when purchasing these kinds of items that the cheaper ones are (1) more likely not to work with certain docking stations and (2) more likely to break or crap out over times. You get what you pay for and like most people, I wanted to get the best deal possible to solve my problem. Now I wish I just spent the extra ten bucks or so and got a better quality one that won't break so soon.<br /><br />Other then this one issue, the product does its job well, there is no loss of sound quality or volume.
0762777931|5.0|If you have seen the film Crazy Sexy Cancer - then you know the story. If not - watch it first. Then this book takes you through what to eat, how, why and when and it does it in a non-judgemental, chilled out way that makes it feel actually possible. In fact - in a very unlikely scenario - I found myself on a juice fast and feeling quite good by the end. Recipes are included.

0393088774|5.0|This book honestly comes down to common sense which is why it's relatively short and extremely easy to understand. I'm sorry, but aside from rudimentary hypothetical economics that's made to make sense in an economy equivalent to an island the size of my toenail, keynsian economics has stood the test of time. What was it that brought us out of the great depression? ... I'll give you a hint, it wasn't austerity. Krugman puts it most succinctly at the beginning when he says that all it really comes down to is modern conservatives not being able to admit that they've been wrong and getting more and more extreme while subsequently getting entangled in a web of lies. His evidence has very few holes in it, and he does a great job of proactively counteracting against typical right-wing answers. The bottom line is pretty clear from the beginning, which I guess is my one problem with it. This book was written to convince and since I was convinced at the beginning (having just finished Robert Reich's Aftershock which follows very similar premises), I did get a bit bored towards the end. Additionally, his solutions provided at the end are a little simplistic and not well outlined. However, I can forgive this as he's not a know it all who pretends to be a politician, he presents his economics and gets out before he gets in too deep. That's the sad part, this book has you saying \\"if only...\\" many times over.

B0055SWM08|5.0|From the music, to the serene feel of what is, after all, a sort of bubble buster, or non-buster, in this case, there is nothing I dislike or feel needs improvement about this game.  The graphics are clean and clear.  The music and the retro touches are soothing.  The variety of puzzles is excellent and the introduction of new elements such as moveable blocks, &quot;poison&quot; drops, and so forth, keeps it fresh.  Some game designers do not seem to be able to cope with touch screen controls.  (Dead by Dawn comes to mind)  These folks at Fallen Tree Games have it down flawlessly.<br /><br />  Two features in particular help raise gameplay a notch above.  One is the on screen Undo.  When you are stuck on a puzzle or your drop has been &quot;killed&quot;, you do not have to exit out the menu to start over; just hit undo.  The rev's have also maximized the gameplay possible on what is, after all, a rather small screen.  They have done this by using more screen than they have by allowing the moving drop to exit screen left and come back into the game grid screen right on the same grid row.  The same for top to bottom and vice versatile.  The hints and tutorial are also clear and flawless which is all to often not the case in my recent experience.  I recommend this game to anyone in search of a relaxing yet challenging pastime.  I think I could feel my blood pressure drop as I was playing.  The music is just right.  A little Zen new age feeling without too many weird tonality scales or Asian musical instruments that may jar Western ears.  Five stars and worth every penny.  The dev has also included a big tasty and playable bite of the sequel game free of charge.

B007HO392S|5.0|Carrie has a formula for the content of her albums. That seems to make them predictably good, but in the context of her other albums, this one seems to be her best effort yet. If you're a fan, you need this one in your collection. If you're not a fan, maybe this is the one that turns you into one. Give it a serious listen, then take it home.
B00005RHGL|5.0|This version of Tombstone is great.  Val Kilmer steals the show as Doc Holliday and Kurt Russell 'aint so bad himself.  I can watch this movie over and over and over again.  I especially like Val Kilmer's lines.  I love how he refers to his lover as his 'Hungarian Devil' and she is beautiful and she was a good woman to Doc Holliday.  A little trivia:  Doc Holliday had been a Dentist prior to the reputation he made for himself as a gunman to be feared.
B007RKPO84|5.0|Kreator, without argument, nailed it on every front with this album.  Every track is consistently entertaining, solid, and constantly transitioning into something else amazing.  Be prepared to be floored (I'm not kidding - I would clear the walls, shelves, and floor prior to your first listen just to be on the safe side).  There are brilliant moments that will remind you of your first encounter with your favorite albums (in my case by King Diamond, Slayer, Swano, and Dave Mustaine - just to name a few), that will bring you back to this album time and time again.<br /><br />Congratulations Kreator!  This album is fantastic, and sets the new standard that other metal bands should aim to achieve.

B007DJUO8O|4.0|First a disclaimer: I am a big fan of PT and Steven Wilson's solo work. I also absolutely love Richard Barbieri's solo work and his collaboration Steve Hogarth. I am also a big fan of ambient music like Harold Budd, Steve Roach, and Jon Jenkins. On the other hand Opeth simply does not connect with me at all. All in all I am biased towards darker ambient music.<br /><br />So, you may be wondering what exactly this album is like. The other reviews are correct in describing what this music does not sound like, and these tunes are hard to categorize. I think these songs are most like the last two albums by Talk Talk. They are very minimalistic, quiet, and intense. It is more like SW's Bass Communion dark ambient work than it is Porcupine Tree. I disagree with some of the other reviews that imply that this is just self indulgent noodling.<br /><br />I had to play it a couple times for it to really soak in and to get over my preconceived notions. I do like it, but not quite as much as the later Talk Talk or Richard Barbieri's solo albums. But it is good enough for me to listen to occasionally.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Ever since 2010 when \\"Caravan\\" and \\"BU2B\\" came out I have been stoked about \\"Clockwork Angels.\\" Was I worried that I would not be pleased by the Trio? Absolutely! Any new album from a band is sketchy, but that just builds the anticipation.<br /><br />One thing I want to clear up before I give my opinion is that many people are complaining about how it's them trying to recapture their \\"glory days\\" and how they have not listened to Rush since a certain period. That is just sad. No one person is wrong in their opinion, Rush has brought out many gems since the 70's, 80's, and 90's. The one thing that has defined Rush as a band was their willingness to evolve and adapt to the music trends, but maintain who they are as musicians and this album proves this! I consider myself an all around Rush fan. I can pick out a favorite album from every genre of Rush.<br /><br />\\"Clockwork Angels\\" is a conceptual album as many know, but it is not like any they have done in the past. The way the story is told has not been attempted by this band before-- Each track is part of the story.  Sure, the story is similiar to what has been done with previous albums, but I actually see a change in tone.  Neil Peart is a man that has gone through many trials in his life and I think this is present in the lyrical content, which is what sets this even further apart from anything previous.  The Band has matured and are comfortable. They have proven their worth the musical world.  The songs are simple, yet complex.  That is the best way to describe the songs here.<br /><br />Overall, another gem from the trio! 5 stars! Can't wait to see them live in September!
B0038AUY96|4.0|Excellent reading.One of those reads that you can't put down and want to finish but dread actually finishing it. At least there is another book after this one in the series.
1475143389|4.0|I read this book. I read Arnold's Encyclopedia of Body Building. I did lots of research. There is no BS in this book - it is all real and I do believe if you follow the plan you will get the promised results. I recommend to buy it.<br /><br />There are a few areas though where I am not 100% sold.<br /><br />One is that statements are made about not doing too much cardio. That may be true of the stated goals of the book of getting as large as possible, but I don't think people should ever be discouraged from doing as much cardio as possible. The US Navy recommends 20-30 miles a week of running, and Arnold even said he tried to run a few miles per day. I think that many will interpret the advice in this book as they should avoid cardio, while it is super useful for heart/lung health - even if you will not get larger from it. If the goal is fitness, run 20 miles per week.<br /><br />Second, there is a lot of talk about not doing cardio within 12 hours of lifting and other timing statements. I doubt any of this is proven, and if you ran a scientific test, the results would likely show no difference between when groups of people did their workouts.<br /><br />Third, there is talk about not eating carbs at night and other such timing of food - That seems to be unproven and just an opinion.<br /><br />Finally, Armold says to do 16 reps of a moderate weight to failure, then 10-12 with a heavier weight to failure, then 8 with an even heavier weight to failure, then 6 with a heavier weight to failure. This book says that is the worst thing to do, and you should not fatigue your muscles on the first two sets and you should not do the first few sets to failure. I can't resolve the conflict between these two methods. It is easy to dismiss what Arnold said as only applying to advanced users, but Arnold specifically gave advice for normal people and made that clear. Also Arnold said that four sets and maybe five was the way to go. So who to listen to? I have to go with Arnold on this unless it is better proven why he was incorrect.<br /><br />This book is a great value as it is only the cost of two useless muscle magazines and you will be way ahead just by following it, even if I could find a few things to question.

B005USZYDU|4.0|The story was a really good,enjoyable book. It's been a long time since I enjoyed a book this much...I recommend it for all ages.
B004LROMSO|4.0|I've been a fan of King Arthur since reading The Once and Future King (T.H. White) decades ago in high school, and have read many, many books both famous and obscure on the subject.  As has been noted, there have been many film versions of the Matter of Britain, some definitely better than others.<br /><br />This year for my birthday, I decided to treat myself to this box set.  I admit the first episode did alarm me a tad with the amount of bare skin and sex featured.  I hoped the show wasn't going to rely extensively on these elements to tell its story.  This, however, died down by Ep 2 and IMO this series got better and better as it progressed.  By the last couple of eps, I was hooked entirely and severely disappointed to learn that there would be no second season!<br /><br />I really enjoyed Jamie Campbell Bower as young Arthur, and Morgan as played by Eva Green--well, she was beyond compare.  It was great to see a Morgan who was truly wicked yet whose wickedness was understandable considering her motivation and background.  It may not have been right that I was rooting for her to win by the end!  But to my mind, Arthur as a character (not to mention Guinevere as a character) was weakened by his involvement in the Arthur/Guinevere/Leontes triangle, which did neither Arthur nor Guinevere any favors and gave each of them a premature history of deception and infidelity long before the expected (and traditional) Arthur/Guinevere/Lancelot triangle.  Why dilute that dynamic with a \\"trial run\\"?  I am aware that \\"triangles\\" are frequent items in modern tv drama and often done to death.  But I found myself getting very impatient with this one, and now when I rewatch, I fast-forward through almost all the Arthur & Guinevere scenes.  The nature of their relationship in this version dragged both of them down.<br /><br />I also liked the way this series hinted at Morgan's nunnery \\"education,\\" mentioned by Sir Thomas Malory in the first pages of the Morte d'Arthur.  Sinead Cusack's Sybil was an intriguing original character, and to those who have commented that Vivien was undeveloped, well, I'm sure the show was intending to do more with her as things progressed.  It seems to be the trend more often than not lately to make Morgan the daughter rather than the step-daughter of Uther Pendragon, and, considering the way Uther is portrayed in this version, you can't blame her much for bumping him off.  Igraine--well, the way she was portrayed, I came away feeling that Morgan's reaction to her (although perhaps not the murder!) was more justified than not.  Igraine may have been Arthur's mother, but she seemed pretty ineffectual throughout, and her eleventh-hour claim that she'd saved Morgan's life when Uther wanted to kill her just rang sort of flat.<br /><br />This was also the first role I've ever genuinely enjoyed Joseph Fiennes in, even if, as my daughter said, \\"This Merlin isn't very 'magical,' is he?\\" :)<br /><br />At the end of the day, for me, it's All About Morgan.  Kudos to Eva Green on a great & complex acting feat of being fascinatingly evil and yet sympathetic, but not too much so due to the choices she made.  I'm not sure if those in charge intended her to be as sympathetic as I perceived her to be, or for the \\"Camelot\\" people besides Arthur to be so dull, but IMO the \\"Camelot\\" residents were pallid in comparison, though Leontes was an effective (largely original) character despite being pivotal in the \\"triangle.\\"
B00884GR0W|5.0|okay. first of all, I absolutley LOVE minecraft! addicting and entertaining, its the bomb! on the PC, everything is a cube or pixelized. even U are! pretty simple. in this version, your tools are not pixelized, and neither are the monsters! I guess what I'm trying to say is this version has better graphics, and therefore, its better. plus, on the PC, its 25$ to make a good account.(as of now!) this version is only 5$. get this app!!!!!

B007MDB71O|5.0|I rarely review movies at Amazon, and there are few movies I care to watch twice, but John Carter is one of those films. I thought everything about this movie was excellent - the scenery, the sets, the actors, and especially the pacing and the plot. I felt I was really on Mars - it was so believable, strange yet familiar. The frame of the story was well done as well. As a fan of the novels, I feared the film would disappoint me but it didn't at all. I don't know what was wrong with the critics. It amazes me what passes for entertainment these days. Most action adventure movies are of little value - the Mission Impossible films could put me to sleep, and the character development in The Avengers was completely lacking. John Carter is that rare action adventure film that makes you realize what movies can be and should be. This is one of the best action adventure films in years and a sign that Disney can still make a terrific and decent film that all the family can enjoy. If only there were more films like this one. And I don't even generally like science fiction either, but this one stands apart. Decide for yourself.
0375869026|5.0|The YA novel Wonder, by RJ Palacio, is the story of August Pullman, an 11 year old boy who happens to have been born with a confluence of genetic abnormalities that result in his facial features being severely under and incorrectly formed. Auggie is otherwise a normal child, he is not developmentally delayed; in fact, he's particularly intelligent and able to understand completely why other children run away screaming when he comes around.<br />Auggie has been homeschooled his whole life until his parents decide to put him in an exclusive New York City prep- right into Middle school. As if life weren't difficult enough, he has to start at an age when school is the toughest socially. His father first argues against this, saying Auggie is like a \\"lamb to the slaughter\\", a phrase which Auggie looks up and fortuitously applies to his current situation.<br />Auggie does go to school and makes friends. Summer and Jack Will are two children Auggie becomes closest to in the school and he falls in and out with them throughout the story.<br />Most interestingly, the story is told from multiple viewpoints, all of them children, none of them the adults who appear regularly. The adults are not portrayed as impotent, clueless or overly-enthusiastic, which is refreshing. They are portrayed as caring and interested, for the most part. The change in perspectives gives the reader a real sense of how Auggie views himself, but also how others view him; it's not all pity, as the reader- and Auggie himself- might assume. Both Jack Will and Summer have their turn, again fortuitously, as they become central to the story and move back out again. Also, Via, Auggie's older, high school aged sister, has an opportunity to share. This is one of the more interesting views, as Via- who has always been Auggie's champion- begins high school and must struggle with changes of her own. Via's boyfriend Justin and her friend Miranda have their stories to tell as well. We see how difficult the lives of these other children are- Jack, Summer, Miranda and Justin, and we can understand that although Auggie may be unusual on the outside, he has a terrific home life- something that not everyone else has.<br />The author did a fine job of not writing Auggie as someone to be pitied. In fact, it seemed that both Miranda and Justin were more pitiful as it were- families who seemed uninterested in them as people and who were never around.<br />This book was trying to give several messages, and while they were clear, the author never clobbered the reader over the head with them.<br />I also enjoyed Mr. Browne's precepts (a concept taught to his students; each month a famous precept was introduced and discussed). Mr. Browne encouraged his students to live by these ideals and to understand the meaning behind them. He also asked his students to write one of their own and mail it to him over the summer. These are included at the end of the book and give a nice closing to the story.<br />In all, I found this book to be an uplifting read, one that teaches lessons, to be sure, but also one that makes the reader feel good.<br />I would recommend this book to all readers.ese other children are- Jack, Summer, Miranda and Justin, and we can understand that although Auggie may be unusual on the outside, he has a terrific home life- something that not everyone else has.<br />The author did a fine job of not writing Auggie as someone to be pitied.

0425241505|5.0|Thea Harrison has filled the ohhh so sad lack of quality dragon shifter romance novels with Dragon Bound.  I happen to think the book is both funny and endlessly entertaining.  I just love that this book is a stand alone in a whole series because it drives me bonkers when authors drag one couple or love triangle for 15 books in a series.<br />The setting is an alternate universe type with a world like ours but magical creatures exist such as shape shifters, fae characters, witches and more unusual creatures that I have not heard of.  The hero is the typical alpha protective male while the heroine is feisty and independent, so you can imagine the collision of temperments and drama.  The banter between the characters was funny but what I appreciated most was the whole world itself, very enjoyable.<br /><br />If you love paranormal romance this will be right up your alley!
1250004217|5.0|1.  Since there are so many reviews on this book, it's almost pointless to write another view other than to give this a 5 star simply because it's that good of a book.  It's not perfect, but then again, nothing is.  It's well written, engaging, poignant, and important.  Highly recommended.

B007MDQW3W|4.0|\\"The piano isn't firewood yet,\\" declares Regina Spektor on the melancholy \\"Firewood,\\" and like so many singers of her ilk, she finds many ways to make you beg her to stay at the keyboards. \\"What We Saw From The Cheap Seats\\" is an album filled full with optimistic despair, desires quenchless, and Spektor's own unique take on the world of pop tunes. There's a finesse to her songwriting that is now taking on the likes of Randy Newman for elegance in the darkness of the human condition, from the aforementioned \\"Firewood\\" to the poignant ballad \\"How.\\"<br /><br />I think it should be noted that her producer this time is Mike Elizondo, the man who helped Fiona Apple rescue \\"Extraordinary Machine.\\" Unlike the multi-producer helmed \\"Far,\\" \\"Cheap Seats\\" maintains a consistent feel and sound. Be it the guttural rasps that she uses to punctuate \\"Open\\" or the longing she drives out from \\"All The Rowboats\\" (...keep trying to row away\\"), she's pulling no emotional punches. Yet, even with the album's cohesiveness and dour lining, there are moments of childlike glee. She pulls the chorus of \\"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\\" into \\"Oh Marcello\\" with such cheer that you'd think she was the original writer, or the warm calypso feel of \\"Don't Leave Me,\\" which bounces along chipperly.<br /><br />Don't kid yourself however. Spektor buries the cruelest cuts in her poppiest moments, like \\"The Party.\\"  \\"You're like a big parade through town, you leave a mess but you're so much fun.\\" \\"What We Saw From The Cheap Seats\\" is on a par with \\"Far\\" and her acknowledge masterpiece \\"Begin to Hope,\\" and is the type of CD that rewards you the more you listen it it. Her track record continues unbroken.

B006GHA9QQ|5.0|Though I'm 33 I only recently discovered Phantom of the Opera when I saw the Royal Albert Hall version with Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Boggess on TV.  So smitten was I with their performances, I was horrified to see that the movie version of the sequel, Love Never Dies, starred two different people.  I almost didn't bother buying it. After seeing this movie on TV and hearing the LND soundtrack with the original cast, I can't help but think Andrew Llyod Webber knew what he was doing when he chose this cast (and especially this particular phantom) to do the movie version.  I thought Ben Lewis' rich voice was perfect for this soundtrack, and he did an admirable job in the acting department.  I get chills every single time I watch his subtle changes in expression during the \\"Beautiful\\" scene.  I think I still prefer Sierra Boggess as Christine(Anna sometimes sounds like she's singing underwater), but she has a believable chemistry with the phantom.  Worth a look. Just suspend disbelief and enjoy the ride and the luscious music.

B007LB1O3I|3.0|She's back but not as super duper as she was before. I was a little disappointed with a little of the album (standard. Haven't looked at the deluxe yet) but the rest was okay.  The tracks that I listen to the most (and really like) are:<br /><br />Girl Gone Wild (a favorite)<br /><br />I'm Addicted (second favorite)<br /><br />Turn Up The Radio (still looking into it but it sounds good)<br /><br />Give Me All Your Luvin' (loved the track when it first came out. Liked the featured Nicki Minaj and M.I.A parts. The Superbowl 2012 Halftime Show was great. Yes what M.I.A did in the show was wrong but I'm not going to judge or criticize her for it)<br /><br />Masterpiece (one of two ballads on MDNA. Decent)<br /><br />As for the rest, I may have to listen to them more in order to appreciate it so for now I'll give it a 3 out of 5. The only song I'm not that crazy about is Gang Bang, which is probably her most violent track to date. Not that I have anything against that (not a violent person) but it just sounds strange to me. Can't really explain it but it kind of sounds like it'd be suited for a video game or something (maybe).  I love Madonna. She's a great artist and everything, but I think maybe she could've done a little better. Half of her album is great but the other half...I'll come back and change this once I've listened to MDNA more. I still think Gang Bang is violent but it's no where as violent as her American Life music video (which I liked but the more violent ending where it shows her up close and covering her ears after she throws a grenade, not so much. Though it might be her way of fighting in a sense).

B0072IVGZG|3.0|How the band (Billy/Ian) can rave about this album and dismiss Ceremony is a stunning telegraph as to how much PR means.  It's not all crap and has its moments, but kicking off the record w/ a track that features the most silly and trite chorus imaginable \\"we got the drugs, we got the drugs, we got the drugs\\" pretty much summarizes that if that's the case, they're not the drugs anyone should lust for.  Overhyped, under produced and full of either just barely solid or soft and forgettable material is hardly a bold declaration that we still have a band capable of creating the waves of hard rock euphoria that used to come so naturally for them.  I saw them last night and live the new stuff is significantly better, the production here however is poor for a hard rock record and compressed (as mentioned by other reviewers) leaving all the tracks sounding muted especially the guitar that does not have nearly the bite necessary to sell this indulgent and rather unfocused collection of songs.  How you can allow half ass production to nullify the only modest horsepower the material is good for is tragic/criminal.  The last album didn't move me much either, so I was hoping for something along the lines of \\"Beyond Good and Evil\\" which is a phenominal album that made the case convincingly the Cult remained a force to be reckoned w/ in the world of real rock music.  Sorry to say, this album doesn't compare favorably to that monster or Ceremony, Sonic Temple, Electric or Love.  It's better than that \\"Goat\\" that came out in 1994 (wasn't it?), but not by much.  Long live the Cult; hopefully long enough to create enough albums or an album to distinguish itself from this dud.  Although the show last night was another stunning classic proving their stage prowess remains fully intact; on Choice of Weapon, their powder is wet.<br /><br />James Perkins<br />Houston, Texas
B007VTVGFQ|5.0|Short Review:<br />For fans of 2005's EXTRAORDINARY MACHINE (particularly the original Jon Brion sessions), Fiona Apple's newest release will not disappoint. It continues the strange, creative journey that Apple started in the 90's. This album is one of the best of 2012.<br /><br />Long Review:<br />Fiona Apple's instrumentation has always been minimal, usually consisting of pianos, bass guitars, drumkits, and a few other accompanying session players. This album however, feels bare-bones. While critics of EXTRAORDINARY MACHINE point to the album's production interfering with Apple's original intention, THE IDLER WHEEL.... feels like an open response to it. It feels like everything unnecessary has been stripped back until the only thing left is raw emotion and artistic intuition. Compare this with EXTRAORDINARY MACHINE, an album that sounded slick, polished, and glossy. This album isn't always pretty, but it sure is powerful. While she's never been known for her shyness, THE IDLER WHEEL... feels like her most confident and sure-handed album to date.<br /><br />THE IDLER WHEEL.... (42:39) opens with the lead single \\"Every Single Night.\\" This song, much like EXTRAORDINARY MACHINE's opener, feels like a mission-statement of sorts. \\"Every Single Night\\" sets the mood for the album. It's tribal, primal, minimalist, and dark. In the lyrics, Apple describes her creative process being a source of pain, uneasiness, and insecurity. \\"Valentine\\" is a dark and seductive love (or out-of-love) song, complimented by low strings -- there's a sense of urgency in this song (as well as others) that makes what feels like an accessible song into an uncomfortable squirm. \\"Regret\\" is dischordant and atonal at times; Apple unexpectedly turns to yell a guttural rasp in the chorus. THE IDLER WHEEL is full of these moments; the songwriting never feels sloppy however, her anger manifests itself starkly in these shifts away from convention. The album ends with \\"Hot Knife,\\" a song that defies any easy genre. Mostly an acapella arrangement, it's catchy, bizarre, and sexy -- it wraps up the spectacular album on a note that is both completely unexpected and completely necessary.<br /><br />You can currently find this album available for streaming in its entirety on NPR's \\"First Listen\\" section. Fans of Tori Amos, Ani DiFranco, Patti Smith, or Regina Spektor will find a lot here to love. Recommended tracks to sample: \\"Every Single Night,\\" \\"Hot Knife,\\" and \\"Valentine.\\" These tracks will give listeners a good idea of what to expect from THE IDLER WHEEL. For an album that's been in the making/shelved for 7-years, it feels remarkably fresh - this is one of the best albums of 2012.<br /><br />The Deluxe Edition of THE IDLER WHEEL comes with the album, an additional DVD of 5 live videos from South by Southwest (only two of these songs appear on the album), a poster of the album, and a small book with lyrics and doodles from Apple. The current price of all of this is only $4 more than the standard edition and is recommended for longtime fans of Fiona Apple.asy genre.

B008133JZG|5.0|How many times have we all mused about the fact that there is nothing good on television?<br /><br />I remember a time when about 80% of humanity had so disavowed the \\"tele\\" and the productions that were being shown on it, that all anyone could do was to boast about how they would mysteriously \\"only watch the Discovery Channel.\\"<br /><br />I don't know what that 80% is saying about TV nowadays, but as for me, I have been pleasantly surprised by the outcropping of shows that have raised the bar of the medium so far as to equal and often surpass the holy grail of visual art, the feature film.  Fx, one of my favorite filmed adventures of all time is \\"Lonesome Dove\\", a TV mini series that rivals or surpasses anything ever put on film, in my humble opinion.<br /><br />Comes now, a retelling of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, revisited and refashioned by a group of visual artists who's love of both Conan Doyle's character and, of the of the visual arts, have come together to show us that film has, indeed, become the literature of the age.<br /><br />I will confess that I have seen just five of the six episodes (the fifth anxiously awaited), but could not help but come to this page to say to anyone who has an ear to hear it, this is one of the best programmes I have ever seen, in any medium, at any venue, at any time in my short life.  I have worked in film, dabbled in writing, watched, admired, and abhorred all manner of attempts to bring story to screen; and, after seeing \\"Sherlock\\", all I can say is, \\"Bravo!\\", and my hat goes off to the people who brought this production to life.<br /><br />So ... what can I offer by way of details, that could justify such effusive praise?<br /><br />Where to begin?<br /><br />To start with, I will quickly mention the components that are required of a review, out of respect for tradition and for the people involved.<br /><br />Our own Mr. Sherlock Holmes has been recreated by Mr. Benedict Timothy Carlton Cumberbatch; a rather pompousand decidedly English name, although I think the four names are more due to marriages and screen name choices, rather than any attempt to claim aegis of the English aristocracy.  The show opens with John Watson, without naming him; and, at first it is hard to tell who this man is supposed to be playing.  But the moment we see Sherlock Holmes, gazing down the lens of a microscope, we are engaged.  Cumberbatch (could YOU pick a better surname for the actor to play Holmes?) is nearly perfect, or better than, because you haven't seen it all until you've seen it all.  I don't know anything about this production specifically, but I can just imagine a frustrated producer asking the director, \\"Well, what is it that you are looking for, exactly?\\"<br /><br />To which the director invariably replies, \\"I don't know, but I'll know it when I see it,\\" to which the producer can only roll his eyes.  In Cumberbatch, \\"it\\" has been found.<br /><br />And a word about John Watson, played by Martin Freeman: this is no bumbling ol' man; but a thoughtful, courageous, war-ravaged veteran, who craves the intensity of wartime, and needs Sherlock as much as Sherlock needs a friend, who is just bright enough to appreciate his genius.  It is a friendship of loyalty, and mutual need, only hinted at in the writings of Conan Doyle.<br /><br />The story is modernized to play to today's audience; Sherlock doesn't wear an 19th century hunting cap, nor does he smoke a pipe.  He muses, \\"It's impossible to maintain a smoking habit in London these days ...\\" so slapping on a few nicotine patches helps him think through some difficult puzzles.<br /><br />He is no stranger to technology, either.  His cell phone is his best friend and he uses it to its full potential to solve crimes and gather information.  And when it comes time for Doyle's classic line, \\"The game is afoot!\\", someone rightly updated the remark to read, \\"The game is on!\\"<br /><br />Even Lestrade has been updated to a more rounded character.No longer the bumbling idiot, fumbling after Sherlock Holmes and railing irrationally at him even as he solves case after case, OUR NEW Lestrade is an earnest man of average intelligence, who knows full well the value of his \\"consulting detective.\\"  And by way of humanizing Mr. Holmes, whom one suspects may be a \\"high-functioning sociopath,\\" it may just come to pass that Sherlock has a care for him as well.<br /><br />I don't think there is any need to give it all away with my blathering.  Watch it.  Love it, like I did, and never again claim that your TV addiction is exposing you to mindless drivel; there's a new sheriff in town; and his name, is Sherlock Holmes! :)<br /><br />Enjoy!
B000PDYVVG|1.0|I am an avid reader. I watched some of this movie & know alot of ppl love this book so I decided to give it a try. I just couldn't get into it. I felt like there was just too much whining. I gave it 9 chapters before I decided to give up on it. Eat, Prey Love is just not my kind of book.
B00122KV5O|4.0|FOR PRE-EXISTING FANS:<br />For listeners deeply familiar with Alanis Morissette's catalog, THE COLLECTION (Standard Edition) may not be worth the time.  The biggest reason to buy THE COLLECTION would be for the deluxe edition's additional material [[ASIN:B000BJS4F8 Collection (W/Dvd)]].  The deluxe edition comes with a great DVD documentary (about an hour in length) that follows Morissette, and it serves to be pretty insightful.  Included in the packaging is a small booklet that includes brief liner notes.  Another for pre-existing fans to purchase THE COLLECTION is for the non-album tracks.  The cover of Seal's \\"Crazy,\\" \\"Uninvited,\\" (from the City of Angels soundtrack) and \\"Still\\" (from the Dogma Soundtrack) are really nice inclusions.  For most pre-existing fans, I would recommend just settling for buying the tracks you are missing from your catalog piecemeal.<br /><br />FOR NEW LISTENERS:<br />For listeners who aren't very familiar with Morissette's work, THE COLLECTION serves as a good place to start.  It collects her biggest hits and sprinkles in a few non-album tracks.  There is a deluxe edition that includes a DVD, but I wouldn't recommend that (more expensive) edition for casual listeners.  If, however, you do not already own any Alanis Morisette albums, THE COLLECTION (or Jagged Little Pill) is a great place to start.
030758836X|1.0|What an awful, awful (and I mean AWFUL) ending to a terribly average book. I had just read Beautiful Ruins by Jess Walter and was trying to decide if I should read Gone Girl or another Walter book.... time wasted I will never get back!!!
0765316994|4.0|This is a fun, breezy read that I highly recommend to those (like me) who love the Star Trek franchises, especially the older ones. It's very approachable and even people who wouldn't normally read Science Fiction should get into the story (assuming they have a fondness for ST and other television SF shows).<br /><br />That said, it also introduces some more weighty concepts into the mix, but Scalzi doesn't dwell on them. Scalzi moves the story briskly along. And it's got the Scalzi touch: he writes dialog that is both witty and compelling. This book is no exception. I liked the concept and the setting, and how fast the plot pushed forward until the end. And I think that the \\"Three Codas\\" at the end of the end were spectacular.<br /><br />As much as I enoyed the novel, the concept (he said vaguely, trying not to spoil) was not entirely original. I remember reading something similar in the nineties, in a collection of ST stories published in fanzines. And I think there are some nods to the plot of Yu's \\"How to Live Safely in a Science Fictional Universe,\\" as well. But if this novel puts the \\"meta\\" into \\"metaphysical SF,\\" then that just goes to show that this novel is solidly within the SF tradition, even if it might aptly fit into the more recent subgenre of \\"The New Weird.\\" But do not get me wrong: Scalzi's got a very original and fresh take on things--it's quite an enjoyable ride.<br /><br />I liked this novel quite a bit and I expect other readers will as well.
B001VLXNLU|4.0|I am in the 7th book now! I love this series! It's so addicting ! It's not the normal vampire book! The characters are great and as you get into it, there is lots of drama & suspense! Love it ;)
B001EU79F4|5.0|By now, most people are most familiar with Tom Waits the Crazy Carnival Barker.  The commercial and critical success of SWORDFISHTROMBONES and RAINDOGS did much to solidify that image in the public's minds, but before that craziness began, there was Tom Waits the Heartbroken Pianist.  CLOSING TIME (and I can't think of a more fitting album title), is a collection of 12 somber tracks.  Most of these are ballads, and most of them are on piano.  What sets this album apart from other singer/songwriters is the lyrical beauty and lived-in voice of Tom Waits.  Here, Waits is much less gravely than he appears to be on later albums, making this (perhaps) the most accessible album to the public conscious.<br /><br />CLOSING TIME begins with the classic \\"Ol '55,\\" a song that the Eagles would later find commercial success with.  It's a beautiful ballad, and it sets the album off on the right note.  \\"Martha\\" is another piano-based ballad that is stunning in its story-driven narrative.  \\"I Hope That I Don't Fall in Love With You\\" and \\"Old Shoes\\" are both driven by acoustic guitar, and they function as more highlights on an already stellar album.  Every track on this album feels particularly well crafted, but one of them felt out of place.  \\"Ice Cream Man,\\" while a great song in its own right, doesn't feel right on CLOSING TIME -- it just feels out of place here.<br /><br />For fans of Tom Waits, this album is essential.  For listeners who are turned off by the strangeness of his work in the late 80's, CLOSING TIME serves as a great entry that is devoid of many of the things that drive those listeners crazy.  Highlights of this album that serve as good sampling material: \\"Ol '55,\\" \\"Martha\\" and \\"Virginia Avenue.\\"  CLOSING TIME is a beautiful mix of smokey bar-room ballads, periodically punctuated by saxophone and double-bass.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I loved this book!  It is one of those books where you fall in love with the characters and want to be their friends or of course the main love interest to Travis. The book was not all great and tied up with a pretty bow.  I liked that the main characters had problems and a past.  It made it a story that could be true and those or the best.  The emotions in this book were great.....they  had you feeling what Abby felt or having your hear go out to Travis when he was the \\"bad boy\\" of the book.  The author Jamie McGuire did an amazing job when she wrote this book and I hope to see more like it.

B007VT6QSI|5.0|Overall this CD is amazing. The music and lyrics mesh so well. He kept his inspirations flowing through out the album. If you have been a fan of his music and liked the first single Boyfriend you will trully enjoy this album. Highly recommend it considering Usher had a large influence on this album.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This was easily the worst book I have ever read, and I have read a LOT of books. I am baffled by the attention this book has received. How do I hate this book? Let me count the ways:<br />1. If I had to read the phrase, \\"I flush.\\" one more time, I was going to throw the book out the window.<br />2. Ridiculously unbelievable characters. So a virgin walks into a torture chamber....<br />3. I am pretty sure after a person has been beaten by her lover while having bondage-style sex, she would cease to blush every time he looks at her. Gag me.<br />4. Does anyone care about these characters at all? They have very little depth, which makes it difficult to understand why she would fall in love with him.<br />5. As for as erotic fiction goes, this was incredibly un-erotic. The sex scenes, while graphic, were not sexy at all.<br />6. This would be a VERY interesting topic if both parties were into the alternative lifestyle. But reading the main character say, \\"I don't want him to beat me.\\" made me want to hunt down the author and beat her with a switch. I have read some very good books and seen some very good movies that revolve around characters that are damaged, but this book is so lacking in any depth that it makes the characters seem as though they are just participating in domestic abuse. It was disgusting.<br />Alright, I could keep going all day but I won't. Just thought that I would mention I have never reviewed a book before, and I read about 3-4 books a week. This was so awful that I had to make an exception. Happy reading! ;)

B007P6VLRS|1.0|Inspiration is a gift of the gods ;-) And alas....they did not share it with Billy on his latest album. I loved the early SP works and no: I do not want Corgan to return to the old days > that road is silly. However, what I DO want is to see some return to the quality (!) that oozes out of the first 3 albums. There are some decent songs on Oceania (like the first 2) but I read somewhere that there was not one bad song on the album .... hahaha really boys and girls! Have you listened to the last song at all???? The best qualification it can get is that it is a \\"filler\\". The lyrics on the entire album are awful. But, to be fair, that is the norm in regular popular music. For that is what this is: regular pop music. Still, I will be seeing them on tour. The energy of the Pumpkins live is still awesome!<br />So...is it a terrible album? No. Is it great: definitely no. Can I live with it? Yeah...I can but it won't be a long term spinner in my CD player. I hate to end this on a negative note...eh...is there nothing to love? Well...there is: it is quite a decent production soundwise. Quite a change from the muddy Zeitgeist.<br /><br />June 23...Damn...I have to change my opinion...it IS an awful album with 1 excellent song (the first one). So..changed my 3 *** into 1 *
B006CHML4I|5.0|The Seiko 5 automatic watch is a great value, costing well less than $100.  I was cautious about buying this watch when I read reviews questioning the water resistance depth, or whether you could even wear this watch in the shower.

For the money you can't go wrong with this watch.<br /><br />Update - August 2012<br />After a summer with this watch, wearing it several times a week, in the shower and while swimming I am pleased that all signs point to my owning this watch for a long time.

Would make a good little 400 page story . . Maybe. . .since little was explained, BUT 1178 pages???

0345803485|1.0|The success of Fifty Shades of Grey is the very definition of viral marketing. A book that was originally self-published as an eBook and a print-on-demand paperback, it somehow caught the imagination of women everywhere and it's said that a copy now sells every sixty seconds. Amazing. There are three books in the series and they are numbers 1, 2 and 3 on the New York Times best seller list, and have been for months.<br />I have three words for this phenomenon: Are you kidding??? I mean really...have you read this?<br />I bought a Kindle version ($9.99), just to see what all the hoopla was about, and got through about 1/3 of it (31% according to my Kindle), rolling my eyes and muttering, \\"Oh, please,\\" on every other page. With one exception (from Jessica Reaves of the Chicago Tribune) it seems to be immune to criticism of any kind (because it's made a boatload of money?), and as an author it's probably bad form to say this (you know that won't stop me), but it's crap. I don't mind the concept of it or the genre of eroticism itself, but something that's selling like the latest iPad release should at least be...well, good.<br />Fifty Shades of Grey is not good. But that's not hurting sales in the least. It doesn't seem to matter that the writing is awful, the characters are unappealing and not engaging, the storyline is non-existent and, worst of all, the sex parts aren't even interesting - just lots of murmuring and moaning and gasping, and quickening heartbeats. Kinda trite. At least be original.<br />You can't argue with the kind of success this book is enjoying - it's phenomenal - and good for E.L. James. She seems as amazed by this as everyone else. But seriously...what are you people thinking? Whatever it is, could you please transfer it to my book? And when mine sells a copy every sixty seconds it won't bother me a bit when E.L. James trashes it on her blog.

B0086700CM|5.0|Fun to play when bored. I am extremely glad that they made a kindle fire version. And as you play you can pick up ways to make your self better.
B007SGM084|1.0|This is awful book in that there was little plot to it. It is only selling because of the sex scenes in it.  I would not recommend it.
0920668372|5.0|This book was given to me by my parent ed instructor when my oldest was a baby. I could SO relate to the mother in the book. Tender and humorous at the same time.
B000AA302U|5.0|Deliciously entertaining and highly enjoyable.  I cannot wait to order the remaining albums of Jamiroquai.  Again, love this band and the delectable Mr. Kay :)
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This was a great 1st read on my new Kindle. I was easily pulled into the story and look forward to the other two books.
B0063IH60K|3.0|i love solitaire and this version is great. however, the ads are ridiculous! every 30 secs or so an ad is popping up. please stop it!
0345529057|5.0|Arrived quickly and in great condition with shrink wrap. There are too many reviews of the actual books so I'll just say it's an amazing series of books and you should definitely read George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire books.<br /><br />The only thing I'd prefer are the original book covers and not the HBO series jackets. No big deal though.
B007T2XC7A|5.0|I love this CD, I listen to it everyday and never get tired of it.  Norah Jones' voice is amazing and her musicians are second to none.  I think Little Broken Hearts is my favorite of her CD's.
B007WULJ5G|4.0|First off, there are reviews for the \\"cut\\" version mixed here with \\"uncut\\" reviews, so check the movie title under the reviewer's own message title for clarification. I won't go into story details as you can find them in other reviews, which you shouldn't be reading too much or it'll spoil the shock element awaiting you. I will say that if there is a definition for the so-called torture-porn labeling of horror movies, this, and only this is it.    I personally thought it was a 5 star movie BUT there's one down side to this \\"uncut\\" version for which I deducted 1 star. You know those really thin DVD cases? Well this version comes in that case glued to a thin cardboard with the label stickered to the other side. I mean, I understand their aim for the packaging but I'm sure most have prefurred a regular one comapared to this cheap one.    But don't let that make you buy the \\"cut\\" version which is only about 40 seconds shorter because those momemts \\"really\\" count and makes the difference. After all the horrific elements shown throughout the movie, I don't why the manufacturer for the original first release decided to cut it. Like someone said, buy this while you can!
B005LAIGPU|5.0|i saw this movie in the theaters with some friends and we all apsolutly fell in love! it is definanly a movie you don't want to see just once! i bought it for my family to watch as well and they all loved it also. not only is the story line incredable, but the way the director filmed it is highly creative, making the movie just that much more amazing. i highly recommend buying this movie. you will not be disappointed. (plus the blu-ray provided much clearer detail, and the director's cut gave exclusive deleted scenes, which definanly made this purchase worth it.)
B005LAIHSQ|3.0|There are things about this movie that were great. But then there were things about this movie that were just not so good or at least could have been much better<br /><br />The Good<br /><br />The acting: Hemsworth did exceptionally well. He was really the best thing about this entire movie. Theron did a very good job as the queen as well and the majority of the other actors (especially the dwarves) had a very good performance as well.<br /><br />CG: The special effects were great. From the phantom armies to the environment, this movie did a great job of portraying a mystical land full of danger and beauty<br /><br />Environment: Costumes and landscape were great. From the merky dungeons, to the ugly castles, to the dreary towns, dark forest, sanctuary, animals, everything about the environment was just great. They probably could have done a little more with the black forest but still, what they did do was great.<br /><br />The ok but could have been much better<br /><br />Battle Scenes: So the previews led me to believe this movie would be a braveheart style movie with a heroine and in the land of mysticism. It wasn't. There were a few battle scenes that were good but most were rather boring and no where close to epic. The very last confrontation was the best and did get you into it but every battle scene leading up to it was lack luster.<br /><br />Story: Now the story is the story that we have all heard before. So I'm not complaining about THAT story, but really they didn't do enough with it to warrant me shelling 20 bucks for me and my wife to go sit in a theater to watch it. If you are someone that just ABSOLUTELY loves the story of Snow White then maybe you probably won't care but all the glitter and glam they added to the story, still fell short of being worth it and taking it from the old old story I've grown up hearing.<br /><br />The bad<br /><br />The acting: Kristen Stewart. I'm sorry but this was either not her movie or not her performance. I liked her in adventureland. But her acting skills either weren't strong enough for this role or she just wasn't the right match. She just fell short unfortunately.<br /><br />All in all it's a decent movie worth watching. Is it worth shelling out 10 bucks a person to watch? No probably not. Is it worth a buck at redbox? Definitely. The beautiful environment and classic story are enough to bring you in but the lack of originality, boring battle scenes, and uneven acting is enough to give you pause.in adventureland.

B0013K6WLM|5.0|This Black Keys album is extremely good!  It is one of my favorites and I'm so glad I bought it.  Amazing songs.
B000096IBI|5.0|\\"Modern Times\\" balances humor and pathos extremely well. For Chaplin, this was his opportunity to criticize authority and progress in the modern industrialized world with its automation and the assembly line, socially elite top management so greedy and mean spirited that two-way television monitors are installed in company bathrooms to keep employees moving and even the advent of talking pictures. Not a minute of the film is wasted; the editing is perfect--I didn't get bored once. In fact, I laughed quite a bit. This is, perhaps, Chaplin's funniest film and easily one of his very best. Chaplin and then-wife Paulette Goddard star in this film and although there is a musical score Paulette Goddard never speaks and Chaplin sings a song in mere gibberish near the end to make fun of talking pictures. Indeed, any talking is done by machines. For example, we hear a phonograph playing a record introducing an employee \\"feeding machine\\" which will end the need for any employee lunch breaks, the radio in the jailer's office allows one to hear speech and when the steel factory boss talks it is only through his two-way televised monitoring system that his words can be heard.<br /><br />Chaplin plays \\"The Little Tramp\\" character; he is an assembly line worker in a steel mill factory who must tighten bolts faster than anyone ever could. When Chaplin fails to keep up he gets dragged onto the actual assembly line and literally becomes a cog in a wheel! He also faces a test when he has to try out an employee \\"feeding machine\\" that doesn't work very well. Chaplin's character eventually goes crazy from the stress and spends time in a hospital to recuperate; he then alternates between disastrous jobs in a modernized world and jail where he is protected from that world although he also begins a sweet romantic relationship with a young homeless women played by Paulette Goddard. The gamin's father has been murdered by a crowd and her younger sisters have been taken away by juvenile officers; this has a terrible impact on her especially since she has a kind and sensitive heart.<br /><br />There's a good deal more that I could tell you but I don't want to spoil it for you. Suffice it to say that there are quite a few humorous scenes including one with Chaplin as a night watchman in a department store who puts on blindfolds to roller-skate, never realizing that he's skating incredibly close to a deep hole in the floor that would have killed him had he fallen into it!<br /><br />It also strikes me as very interesting that the only two people in the film who are truly humane--and human beings--are the nameless Little Tramp and his girlfriend; although they are \\"low on the totem pole\\" and unable to fit into modern society I was rooting hard for them! They represent a type of humanity that has been lost in Chaplin's \\"Modern Times.\\"<br /><br />The second DVD has many extra features on it; and they're all good. I particularly liked the documentary entitled \\"Chaplin Today: Modern Times;\\" the two deleted scenes which include Chaplin's entire nonsense song; \\"Behind the Scenes in the Machine Age\\" and the short documentary footage of some very poor Cubans watching their first movie, \\"Modern Times.\\"<br /><br />\\"Modern Times\\" is one of the best films I've ever seen. Charles Chaplin is at his best here and Paulette Goddard makes a wonderful leading actress. I highly recommend this film for Chaplin fans; newcomers to Chaplin's movies; comedies that mix humor with social and political messages and classic silent films with both comedy and tragedy.s; this has a terrible impact on her especially since she has a kind and sensitive heart.<br /><br />There's a good deal more that I could tell you but I don't want to spoil it for you.

B0086700CM|5.0|The best free app out there. I've had lots of fun playing this on my Kindle Fire! I recommend it.
B0053O89WY|3.0|SPOILER ALERT! Do not read on if you wish not to know any climax or revelation of the season!<br /><br />First off, I have never written a review on anything but am someone who has been a true fan of the series and am frightened at where the series is headed.  I have seen the first 4 seasons at least 25 times and still watch them regularly.  I have also seen the entire 5th season numerous times.  I am still a true fan I will continue to watch, however I feel the show is being more adapted to the general public with the need for a romance factor and aligning with mainstream ideas.<br /><br />I would like to look back at the first season when the physics jokes were written with much more wit.  The writing was phenomenal!  With myself having a physics minor I understood them clearly; some others in the room did not understand many of the jokes yet they also found them funny simply because they did not get it. It is a bit of a paradox: both funny understood and funny not understood.<br /><br />Though Sheldon may be considered the main character, Penny is the key to the show.  What would the Big Bang Theory equation be without the girl across the hall?  Penny's character is both necessary and applauded.  However the other girlfriends in the show have been given too much importance.  I do at \\"some times\\" enjoy the characters of Bernadette and Amy but wish they did not have relationships with their \\"boyfriends!\\"  I thought the premise of the show was that the nerds know nothing about women and are unable to pursue a relationship.  Yet they now all have one, except Raj of course.  I understand a show needing character evolution and the evolution of relationships to prevent something from becoming repetitive.  But is it really necessary for every character to be paired with a girl when the the premise of the show was the opposite. Especially Sheldon! Who has no need for a physical or emotional relationship since he is of course a \\"robot!\\"<br /><br />At the end of the seasonwhen they showed the three couples holding hands at the end it was a complete and utter disappointment for me.  I remember no point in the first 3 seasons that the writers were pulling at heart strings to gain ratings.<br /><br />I wish the gain no disrespect towards the actors, writers, or producers because in all they have done a job well done and have given me a show that I can repeat word for word as well as adore.  I just ask that they just please revert back to the the original ideas.<br /><br />To break it all down the series was just simply funnier when:<br /><br />Raj did not have a drink in his hand whenever they felt it was necessary for him to talk!<br />Howard was CREEPY and not \\"sentimental\\", and definitely not married!<br />Leonard had no experience with women!<br />SHELDON DID NOT AND WOULD NOT ACCEPT A GIRLFRIEND!!!<br />And Penny... well I guess shes just always been perfect for this show!<br /><br />In my revision I seem to be a Penny fanatic, yet the funny thing is that I am not. The truth is that she has been the only consistent character in the series and I wish I could say the same for the others!
B001PA0FFO|5.0|Excellent, well casted movie. Probably best viewed with someone else so that you can discuss your findings.  A movie that needs to be watched more than once inorder to formulate your final conclusion.  A real thinker!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I read the Kindle sample of this book and absolutely could not stand it. I have torn through wonderful books on my Kindle (i.e. reading an entire book within an evening) and this was languorously painful to stumble through (pun intended).<br /><br />Perhaps this book may have been tolerable if Miss Anastasia Steele was not an incredibly dull yet nerve-grating person. I have never hated a character so fiercely since Voldemort of the Harry Potter series. She starts the novel off by whining about her (dark brown, typical Mary Sue) hair. Why couldn't she be blonde or a redhead? Ana is 21 and incredibly prudish and naive, even though she does not seem to be religious. Because she is such a prude, she never curses, using awful sayings such as \\"double crap.\\" Really?? She dresses like a frumpy 50-year-old, and is unbearably self-conscious. She is silently judgmental, making note that her roommate's pajamas have \\"too many rabbits.\\" Even though she automatically accepts the task, she whines about the interview she does for her friend like she's going to the gynecologist, \\"damn\\"-ing her friend for the oh-so-difficult situation. The only amusing part was when she asked Mr. Grey if he was gay. Since she is so quiet and \\"different,\\" she listens to indie rock music and reads British literature. Too bad she's still boring, and has no literary prowess to show for it. She describes Mr. Grey's voice as \\"warm and husky like dark melted chocolate fudge caramel...or something.\\" Seriously?<br /><br />From what I hear, this book was based on a fan-fiction of Twilight. I must admit that I read and enjoyed the Twilight series, but acknowledge it as a guilty pleasure that does not serve as a good influence on young girls. Also, the writing in Twilight is actually decent, interesting, and downright humorous at times. Anastasia Steele is worse than Kristen Stewart's lifeless, vacant, mouth-breathing interpretation of Bella. I have no interest in hearing about her \\"erotic\\" adventures through herbland, self-loathing perspective. It was too awkward reading about the scene in the hardware store, as I could not grasp why Mr. Grey was so sexually interested in her and her \\"oooh, don't look at me, Mr. Grey!\\" attitude. She dismisses their chemistry as \\"static\\" electricity. Lame.<br /><br />If you are vacillating between choosing to read this or The Hunger Games, please choose the latter. The book actually has clever writing via crisp imagery, interesting characters, and a wonderful, empowering message despite its dystopian setting.
B006R8GK2Q|3.0|I like this type of game but the items are not clear even when you span to enlarge.  It's really to early in the game to give a truthful rating. Ask me again.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I thought this book was just an excuse to shock middle age women with really explicit sex scenes.  The story is lacking and unbelievable at best.  The writing is poor and I felt a bit dumber having read it.  I do a lot of reading and there are so many others books that are much more satisfying than this.  But if you want to read sex scenes where the girl has \\"the best orgasm of her life\\" every time, then go ahead.  Be warned that the book does not have an ending, so you may end up wanting to continue the series.  I think I will hold out.
1936608898|5.0|Just when I thought I looked at the Paleo diet in every way possible, The Hartwigs from Whole9 put out their book, \\"It Starts With Food\\".  I'm glad I picked it up and I'm certainly glad that I read it.  I especialy liked reading the psychological and addictive feelings we as humans have around food.  The deck is stacked against us (thanks food industry) but this book assists in breaking you from SAD (standard American diet) to a proper way of eating.  For me, I've lost weight, sleep better and have way more energy.  I have more things to work on, but then again this is a marathon and not a sprint.  Small progress each day eventually adds up to great things.  Take the first step and read this book!
B005DOKM9M|5.0|Thanks for this. Worked fine. Fast shipping. Cant go wrong. Thanks again Amazon. Nice and soft for my Kindle. Stylish also. lol
B007QNRMUU|3.0|It's an ok album for Jason Mraz, Its a little less than loveable in terms of catchiness and longevity. It's good for a few listens here and there, but overall i am a little disappointed in the album as a whole considering how addicted i was to his last \\"we sing, we dance...\\" I was nice effort though.
030758836X|4.0|Let me start by saying this was one of the best books I've read in a long time. My Daughter doesn't usually like Mysteries, but when I started reading the book, I purchased it for her too. We both loved it and couldn't put it down.<br /><br />I was on the edge of my seat waiting to see how the story would end. What a huge disapointment I had when I finally got to the end. Why would you write a great book like this one, and end it like that? The end left you hanging. It was like she finished the book in a hurry.<br /><br />I was going to purchase other books by this auther while I read this book, but now, I doubt I will. If they all end like this one, I don't want to get started reading them.

B000V5ZIBU|4.0|Every first season of a Star Trek series, except for The Original Series, starts off a bit uneven as the writers try to find their thematic course and the actors get to know their characters. DS9 does have the best opening episode of the follow-up series (TNG, DS9, VOY and ENT) thanks to revisiting the events of Wold 359 and Starfleet's disastrous battle with the Borg. We meet a conflicted Commander Sisko who survived the destruction of the USS Saratoga at the hands of the Borg. He and his son Jake escaped but they lost Sisko's wife Jennifer. Sisko comes face to face with his wife's \\"murderer\\" when he meets Captain Picard. Picard was Locutus of Borg during the Battle of Wolf 359 and Sisko cannot let that truth go. Sisko may not stay in Starfleet but he comes under the influence of the Bajoran Prophets, aka the Wormhole Aliens, who have a special connection with the Sisko. The first season of DS9 has Sisko reexamine his life, his choices and his newly found connection to Bajor which is recovering from a long hostile occupation by the Cardassians. The wormhole near Bajor is stable allowing travel to the Gamma Quadrant. So while Sisko and his crew boldly sit on a station where everybody goes the writers do have the wormhole there to allow Sisko and our heroes to explore this newly discovered Gamma Quadrant. We meet a host of new characters to go with Commander Sisko. My favorites from the start were Quark, the Ferengi who owns the bar and his nemesis, Constable Odo, who is a shape-shifting alien of unknown origin. We have Chief Engineer Miles O'Brien, who transferred over from the USS Enterprise and his wife Keiko. The doctor is fresh out of the Academy and happy to be on \\"the frontier.\\" The science officer turns out to be an old friend of Sisko's but now as a different person and gender than before. The Bajorans aren't all thrilled to have the Federation helping out and that is reflected in the attitude of Sisko's Bajoran liaison and second in command, Major Kira. Sowe get to know these characters as the season plays out and we get a hint of the danger to come but nothing too serious... yet. A good start for this Star Trek series that took a different direction than the other starship-based shows. We get to mix in philosophy, religions, morals, and we explore through the shades of gray that live between the black and white of sentient existence.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|the game is good until u have beat it an have the repitition of doing it again. then. it gets boring and less interesting but overall it is a great game.
B00783NWB6|5.0|This is a great movie to watch even if you aren´t a fan of the Underworld franchise, the sound was one of the best I heard and complement the good experience of watching and enjoying the return of Kate Beckinsale, looking so powerful in her black suit that makes you love her even more. About the transfer for the 3d release, it wasn´t what I expect according the other reviewers wrote about it, the 3D complement the movie but if you focus only in the 3D effects you may notice that is not one of the bests like Gahoole or Journey to the Center Of The Earth (the best ones I ever saw).<br />Other think I love from this 3D Blu-ray is the Special Features and Extras, especially the 3D trailers of other 3D releases. I hope the 3D Blu-ray Producers take this good example of what a customer wants when buy a movie.

B0059XTUVI|5.0|[[ASIN:B0059XTUVI The Iron Lady]]<br /><br />Margaret and Meryl shine bright in this film.  Lady Thatcher, a 20th century icon, proved to be what the doctors ordered for 1980's British economy, a first in more than one way.  She survived the treacherous world of politics at the pinnacle for longer than her predecessors.  Inevitably her time to shine came abruptly to an end but detracts nothing from her many achievements.  Meryl tackles this role with her usual perfectionist gusto and succeeds beyond all expectation.  She is more than believable in the role and brings out Margaret's human side as a wife and Mother as well as senior citizen.  A pleasure to watch even though artistic license has been liberally taken with the facts.

B0069UP2PI|3.0|The major danger to most of the world's citizens are malevolent or destructive acts by governments. Wars, concentration camps, etc. This flick is about the exact opposite thing: Government workers (the CDC mainly) are saving people from a malevolent virus-based plague. This has, of course, never happened, but who knows? This virus behaves as no other virus in history does, insofar as it can be caught any number of ways.  Viruses specialize as regards how they are transmitted to a host.  But not in this movie.<br /><br />There is no real plot here except 1) there is a virus-based plague; and 2) the Government swings into action to find a cure. Then society starts to break down (which has never happened in modern times in response to a plague, but who knows?)...<br /><br />There are some big named stars in this flick, but mostly the film is an infomercial about how lucky we are to have Government researchers standing around at taxpayer expense to cure Bird Flu or some other plague that might happen some day but never has. Not much room left for acting or drama. The only romantic angle to this movie sees a sordid cheating Gwyneth Paltrow get killed off in grisly fashion in the first ten minutes to the chagrin of Matt Damon, her cuckolded but loving husband. Pretty grim stuff. Pretty grim marriage too, I guess.<br /><br />This is a watchable movie because someone plowed a lot of money into it. If you like to be scared by hyped-up non threats like Bird Flu, Global Warming, etc. then this film is for you. RJB.

B007549W62|5.0|The  titular Divide is between humanity and savagery. It's a nihilistic , post apocalypse tale of survivors trapped in a bomb shelter. It's dark graphic,violent and depressing yet so well written and acted that it's hard to stop watching.In particular Milo Ventimiglia's character of \\"Josh\\"'s  descent from normal to total sociopath is absolutely brilliant. It's not going to be everyone's cup of tea . Recommended for Mature audiences only.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love everything! the coins idea id great I play tor days straight it so addictive ... and you get bonus coins for almost everything. a. must. have.

B001JIFYSA|5.0|I have watched this movie about 3 times as of now and it's amazing as ever. It's my favourite movie. I'm not someone who loves romantic movies but this is the exception. Maybe because it is so much than just romance. It portrays different kinds of love. All the actors did great job with their characters.<br /><br />I definitely recommend it to everybody.
B007SGM084|5.0|Even if you put aside all the kinky sex scenes (they are a bit difficult to ignore!) I found the evolution of Christian and his relationship with Anastasia to be totally engrossing.  Figuring him out was difficult for Miss Steele, and for us too.  I bought the trilogy for Kindle, so one book moved seemlessly into the next.  I really enjoyed watching these two figuring it all out.  Wish there were more to read.  I miss them!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|As soon as I started reading, I couldn't close the book. The ending kept me anxious in reading for more. Very good, I recommend!
0345803485|1.0|I really don't know what all of the fuss is about in regard to this book.  I felt it was poorly written.  I also felt that it made an attempt to romanticize abuse in a relationship.  I will not read the remaining two.  I read this only because my book club selected it as our most recent read.
B00003CX8Y|2.0|while viewing the dvd, it skipped in several places. I had to stop and start the dvd to make it progress to the next frame. I was disappointed in the dvd and I probably won't ever watch it again. It is too much trouble to return it.

B00006I53S|5.0|First off, this isn't an L lens. Let's make it clear that I am rating it in it's class, in that odd in-between area between the basic lenses and the pro gear.<br /><br />I've been using this as my primary lens on a Canon T2i for 3 months now, and am starting to find where I like it and how to get it to work with my behavior.  The IS (image stabilization) is single mode for four axis (up down left right) and works REALLY well, and doesn't seem to be much of a battery drainer as I can fill a 32Gb card (1000 RAW shots approx.) and half of another before I need to change my batteries (using a 2-cell grip); with IS turned off I still can't fill that second card before the camera goes into low-power standby.  Not having any 2-axis mode can make IS panning shots a bit of a pain as you have to turn the whole thing off, so it really turns into how smoothly you can hold the camera... no cheating here, folks!<br /><br />While an f/3.5 isn't great, shooting in low light such as stage photography works fairly well as long as your camera has good noise reduction; however stepping up to the f/5.6 when pushed out to 135mm ISO becomes somewhat more tricky, in finding proper light without filling the shot with noise.  The aperture is a step and a half down from better quality parts like the 24-105mm f/4L at full zoom, and while the f/4 allowed me to keep at ISO 1600, in the end shooting stage at ISO 3200 with a better quality sensor and a much cheaper lens turned out to be the route for me, and the 28-135mm has been pretty much my given choice for most of my photography.<br /><br />Sharpness is artistically good wide open at f/3.5 through f/5.6, but you will see some softness, especially towards the edge (will be more apparent on full-frame cameras), but sharpens up nicely as you approach f/8, and then softens up again as you push up towards the minimum at f/22, but isn't problematic at all anywhere, largely the reason why I chose this lens.  A lot of the other (cheaper) options see a narrower band of \\"really good sharpness\\" where here I often shoot with the aperture wide open because it just produces cleaner images.<br /><br />The fact that this lens has full-time manual focus is a joy that you will not get with the basic options, and is something I really recommend to anyone who is chasing the subject and can't make them pose.  If the camera locks focus while they are in motion, it is almost constant that it will be off, because the camera's focus intelligence just isn't up to that level, and being able to manually adjust focus at a whim can save you from taking pictures of out-of-focus blur.<br /><br />Placement of the zoom and focus rings is very neat, making the lens easy to work while your eyeball is stuck to the viewfinder.  The distance scale is an excellent resource for fixed point shooting as you can easily dial it in after you've found your focal point.  And the switches for auto-focus and IS are placed neatly on the left facing surface so again you can easily make adjustments without interrupting your shooting.<br /><br />This lens is an internal zoom, so the end ring does not rotate, which makes it ideal for using polarizing filters.  The ultra-sonic motor is quick and quiet, far faster than cheaper lenses, but again an L lens will embarrass it on both factors.<br /><br />In general, if you are looking to build a good rig without spending yourself dry, this is a great way to go.  If you are spending the money to buy a higher-grade camera than my T2i, then perhaps you are outside of the class for this lens, and the L series would treat you better, but in general this particular part will treat you right.a narrower band of \\"really good sharpness\\" where here I often shoot with the aperture wide open because it just produces cleaner images.<br /><br />The fact that this lens has full-time manual focus is a joy that you will not get with the basic options, and is something I really recommend to anyone who is chasing the subject and can't make them pose.

B006IYFCIM|5.0|As other reviewers have posted, the \\"Honest Truth About Dishonesty\\" is an interesting book in and of itself to gain a better understanding of how behavioral economists approach business-related topics. I decided to read it more specifically in the context of two issues now in the news. First, there's the political debate about the goals and methods of people in power (a.k.a. the 1%, new upper class, or elites). In his book \\"Coming Apart\\" Charles Murray describes these elites in glowing terms as the people with brains and creativity who are identified by tests like the SAT, thrown together in elite universities and then again in corporate and government jobs to propel our economy and society forward. But in his book \\"Twilight of the Elites\\" Chris Hayes describes how some of these same elites have in fact propelled us through a failed decade where they have perpetrated frauds, engaged in unethical and dangerous behaviors for profit, and allowed cheating to become a norm in their institutions.<br /><br />Second is the issue of how we are all affected in this kind of make-it-up-as-you-go environment. In his book \\"A Piece of the Action\\" Joe Nocera  described in 1994 how the money revolution had \\"created a layer of complication to our already complicated lives, adding responsibilities that didn't exist before, making it necessary for us to learn about things that never used to be among our concerns. We can make mistakes with our money now, and those mistakes can be costly.\\" In the almost 20 years since Nocera wrote that, things have only gotten more complicated -- what with vanishing pensions, gyrating stock markets, more onerous health care options, and housing crises. Hayes wonders now \\"whether the greatest threat we face is distrust ... in a society bankrupted by norms and order or ... the actual malfeasance and corruption of the pillar institutions themselves.\\"<br /><br />So with my interest in those two particular issues -- both clearly affected by dishonesty -- Dan Ariely's book promised to add some unique insights. While there is no shortage of opinions on these topics, Ariely comes at them from a fresh and non-political perspective. His chapter intros and set-ups to his various studies allude to these bigger issues, but he structures his experiments to learn psychologically whether and why people cheat in specific and controlled situations. Another reviewer commented that college students might not be the best subjects to use, but by Murray's reckoning this is the formative age where many of our future decision-makers start to establish their work habits, their team interactions, their moralities, and their sense of how far they can go before they get caught. I especially like how Ariely structures his chapters -- and presumably the series of experiments he selects -- around extensions of earlier experiments he's already conducted. So if people do cheat, do they cheat more as they get tired? Do they admit to themselves that they cheat under certain situations? Do they cheat more when they see others cheating around them? Do they cheat more when they're working creatively? By covering each of these and more aspects in separate chapters, you can see how these propensities to cheat might build upon each other, especially in work situations when the pressure is on to perform in opportunistic environments.<br /><br />So what did I take from Ariely's work on the two topics I was interested in? While the book does not have specific chapters that address either of these two issues in those exact framings, Ariely does describe situations and scenarios that both leaders and each of us find ourselves in which actual dishonesty or the temptation to benefit dishonestly comes into play. On the elite dishonesty topic, one can see how a group of people under pressure to find new ways of making money, to get around specific regulations, or to take advantage of new technologies might be predisposed to cheat. Knowing that other people are billing more liberally and being less than honest almost forces honest people to skirt the rules. Ariely points out that creative people who are driven to make their organizations win are often the most effective liars and cheaters. He explains -- much as Nocera did in describing new financial products 17 years ago -- how new technologies are often used initially to gain unfair advantages over consumers until regulators and consumers figure them out and protect themselves better.  All of this indicates how cheating can become rampant without constant vigilance. I would assume Ariely supports a more regulatory environment, given what he knows about what people do when left to their own devices.<br /><br />Ariely also offers some observations about how and why it is difficult for all of us to protect ourselves when marketers have taken advantage of people's readiness to cut corners. He describes how pharmaceutical reps are trained to offer samples and freebies to doctors until the doctors feel obliged to then lean in their direction. And how our trust in doctors, bankers and financial advisors after working with them for long periods almost makes us bigger marks for recommending actions that may not actually be necessary. As you read these chapters, you get the feeling that we almost expect to be cheated because we might cheat ourselves in similar circumstances.<br /><br />All in all, the book is a little depressing because it implies that -- since we are all somewhat afflicted by doing things we can get away with -- we may not be so eager to punish others for their dishonesty. No one has been prosecuted for their misdeeds in causing the mortgage debacle, for instance, when previously executives were prosecuted for the Enron and Worldcom frauds. Are we just getting used to these behaviors, even when they almost destroy our economy? Are we so dependent now on the elites that run our institutions that we can overlook these \\"small discretions\\" because if they're successful it may lead to improved economies and job creation? Is it becoming more true that the ends justify the means?<br /><br />Ariely does not offer any specific ideas for curbing dishonesty. For instance, as a professor he is aware that his students use their laptops and cellphones to \\"multitask\\" during his classes and that some students may go to essay mills to purchase term papers. He went so far as to try to purchase an essay from one of these \\"services\\" to assess the state of that \\"industry.\\" Upon seeing what he got, Ariely observes, \\"we were rather relieved, figuring that the day had not yet arrived when students can submit papers from essay mills and get good grades. Moreover, we concluded that if students did try to buy a paper from an essay mill, just like us, they would feel they had wasted their money and wouldn't try again.\\" In other words, it wasn't that it was wrong that they did it ... only that the technology hadn't figured out yet how to provide such services. The onward march of fraud and corruption.<br /><br />Ariely summarizes that while most people have a propensity to cheat, by and large we all \\"pass up the vast majority of these opportunities every day without thinking we should take them. This means that we're off to a good start in our effort to improve our moral fiber.\\" My assessment is that if you read the book you'll know better to protect yourself and have some idea of why the people you might have trusted are motivated to cheat.ing more liberally and being less than honest almost forces honest people to skirt the rules.

B007VTVGAQ|4.0|It's absolutely wonderful to have a new Fiona Apple album to listen and relisten to after far too much time away from the studio, but IMHO there are two major caveats to this new release:<br /><br />1) The album isn't really, for lack of a better term, melodic.  For better or worse, several of the songs on this album have the melodic structure of Free Jazz with no real defined musical structure.  While this suits Apple's style and lyrics well, those expecting an expansion of her more conventionally structured songs as found on her last album, \\"Extraordinary Machine,\\" will likely be disappointed.<br /><br />2) Epic provides the CD in very disappointing \\"Digipak\\" cardboard packaging rather than a standard CD jewel box, meaning to fit in with your CD collection you'll need to take an X-Acto knife to the product to get it to fit in a jewel box.  At least it included a standard-sized CD booklet that can be inserted into the cover of a jewel box, but you're on your own when it comes time to slice and dice the package into something that works as back and side panels.<br /><br />In short, this album is a must for any Apple fan, but if your sole exposure to her is the song \\"Criminal\\" and the songs on Extraordinary Machine, you may want to sample the tracks before ordering and just purchase the tracks you prefer.  Her new songs are good but challenging, and like many \\"art\\" films you may have to force yourself to sit through some of them before you can appreciate the artistry within.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is a very cool game, but some of the games are to hard and seem nearly impossible to win. I am really only rating this game for the extra loins it gives out.
0439023513|3.0|I just finished reading all three books in the [[ASIN:0545265355 The Hunger Games Trilogy]].  And since there are about a bazillion reviews on here for MOCKINGJAY, I will keep mine short.<br /><br />I think the choice for the title was appropriate.  From [[ASIN:0439023491 Catching Fire (The Hunger Games, Book 2)]]: \\"A mockingbird is just a songbird. A mockingjay is a creature the Capitol never intended to exist.  They hadn't counted on the highly controlled jabberjay having the brains to adapt to the wild, to pass on its genetic code, to thrive in a new form.  They hadn't anticipated its will to live.\\"  Book 3, MOCKINGJAY, is all about Katniss' will to live.  It features her (continued) struggle with the Capitol during the Rebels' rebellion.  And she, herself, was \\"a creature the Capitol never intended to exist\\" because they \\"hadn't anticipated [her] will to live\\" and \\"adapt to the wild\\" and \\"thrive in a new form.\\"<br /><br />Unfortunately, MOCKINGJAY is the weakest in the Hunger Games Trilogy.  To me, it feels like the author ran out of steam and was just writing to fill up the pages because she had to produce a trilogy for her publishers. She knew how she wanted the series to end, but she didn't know how to get there without a lot of unnecessary, weak filler and blabber.<br /><br />I couldn't wait for the book to end.  The story seemed to drag on and on.  And just when an interesting turn of events would finally happen, Katniss would become incapacitated and lose consciousness (over and over and over), thus cutting off the reader's only point of view.  She'd then wake up and learn in a quick synopsis (along with the reader) what happened.  Really?  The author bored us with the unnecessary, mundane story and then skipped over the good, important parts?  You've got to be kidding me.  MOCKINGJAY was all about talking about things that happened after the fact instead of actually pulling the reader into the actions and events as they occurred.<br /><br />Did I like the ending?  Again, I think it could have been much, much better and much more informative.  It felt as weak as the rest of MOCKINGJAY.<br /><br />I'm grateful that the series is over because I don't think I could take another sloppily written book by Suzanne Collins.  However, I have every confidence in Lionsgate Films that they'll take the basic outline of MOCKINGJAY and turn it into something much better on the silver screen.ending?

B007P6VLRS|1.0|Serously, OCEANIA is nothing like the old stuff. Apart from the bland riffs and melodies Billy never sounded more tired and old. He seems to be phoning it in in vain search for a decent melody. But none of his vocals are memorable. They all sound the same. There is no dynamic range anymore. I've been a hardcore fan for twenty years and this album is a major letdown.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Hollywood did an amazing job with this movie! Even those who aren't into Marvel and superheroes will enjoy it. They took time to develop the characters (in case you hadn't seen the earlier solo movies.) My only complaint is that they didn't have Hawkeye included as much as I would have liked. :-/ But other than that, they had great visuals, so awesome action scenes, and lots of humor (can you say \\"Tony Stark\\"?) :-D It was surprisingly clean...I was very impressed. Out of all the Marvel movies, this is the best! Now I just hope they come out with a solo movie for Hawkeye and Black Widow. I'll be looking forward to seeing Captain America 2, Thor 2, Iron Man 3, and Avengers 2. (ALL of which they ARE coming out with, if you didn't already know that!!)  Here's some statistics: (from [...]) They made $200.3 million in JUST THREE days to become the biggest opening weekend of all time. Before it had been in theaters even a week, globally it had produced over $700 million!    Here are the dates for the future Marvel movies!! =) Can't wait!  Captain America 2: April 4, 2014!    Thor 2: November 15, 2013    Iron Man 3: May 3, 2013    Avengers 2: Already in development. Expect to see in a theater near you sometime in the no-so-far-off future!    Black Widow and Hawkeye solo movies also EXPECTED to come soon! :-)    BE SURE TO WATCH IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE CREDITS!!! Very important! (Unfortunately, I did not. YouTube saved me.)     To sum: There is some brief mild language. Violent content. Action-packed. Very exciting. Impossible to feel sleepy or bored when watching the Avengers. A must-see! :-) So what are you waiting for? It's definitely the best movie of the year so far, IMO.    But of course they haven't come out with The Hobbit yet. :)
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|very easy to use and its for free.  you have to read some adds but you can do many operations. please keep it simple.
B00785P2QC|5.0|great. very addicting but they are always trying to get u to buy stuff yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yew yew yes
B007VT6QSI|5.0|This album is really good.  All of the dance inspired songs are definitely the high points, but any 'filler' on Believe is grade A.  Justin Bieber has done a great job maturing into a much more accessible sound than any of his past releases.  Give him a few more years and I am hoping he will release an album comparable to the quality of FutureSex/LoveSounds or Thriller.  All he needs is time.
B00785P2QC|4.0|good game. only issue is with the permits and such. other than that it seems pretty solid. i would recommend it to people who love the original virtual city.
B0034G4P4Y|5.0|Very fun. Some reviews said their family found it boring. I'm not sure what movie they were watching but we found it very entertaining. We placed our order to buy it the day after we watched our rental. Must watch on Bluray. The night sea battle scenes have become my image quality testing content for my TV.<br /><br />I also found no issues with the disc, case, menus or the like.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Do not waste your time and money! I have no problem with the subject matter but the writing is more painful than any spanking Mr. Grey could dole out.  This terribly written piece of work has only enjoyed success because people who might be too conservative or shy to stroll into the erotica section at the book store can buy it anonymously on line and read it on their ereaders.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|I love Alawar Entertainment  games...they are so creative and challenging. They offer enough advice during the game so you don't get hopelessly stuck, but it still takes time to figure it out. Great games!
B0083GOPSG|1.0|This movie script was poorly written. It jumped right into the kids and the super powers they got. It was so boring and slow with seemingly no point that we shut it off half way through. We should have rented MI3 instead.
B00466HM28|2.0|I was attempting to find a piano that I could use attached to a macbook in order to learn how to play.  Of course I'm a novice and only new I needed something that would work with Garage Band on a Mac.  This was selected because it was very portable and inexpensive as compared to other options.  After receiving the piano and starting my lessons, I find that it doesn't have enough keys for me to be able to easily follow the lessons on Garage Band.  So, I bought a larger piano, from another manufacturer that does work better for my needs.  Perhaps this will work for a more experienced pianist but for this novice, in training person, it just doesn't cut the mustard.  Buy at your own risk.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Given the hype I should not have been shocked but I was.  The first book is far more explicit than I am comfortable recommending.<br />Having said that, know that I did read all three in the series.  Skipped a lot of the perverse activities but the basic story is good.<br />Cannot wait to see how they convert this to film.<br />The ending of the third book is poorly written and shows the authors inexperience.<br />But who am I to knock success of these books that have been on the New York Times bestsellers list and even Costco is selling !!
B000002LK1|5.0|I can't say how many times I listened to this since it came out. My first exposure to the album was back when Enjoy the Silence came out... I absolutely loved the king-in-the-mountains video. It was actually one of my first cd's. I recommend this album to anyone interested in listening to poppy electronic music. The sound design and arrangements are absolutely unparalleled among synthpop albums. A studio masterpiece.
B0086700CM|5.0|great game. I will recamend this game to all of my friends and family. you have to try this game. best game ever.
B0086700CM|5.0|love it(: its very fun when you have nothing to do! its a great game!(; download it downland it download it! you'll love it
B0052VUNHC|4.0|This book was exciting and fun to read.  I have to admit, though, that I liked the first half of the book a lot more than the second half.  I loved Travis at first, his character had just the right amount of self- destructiveness.  But then his character became a little too obsessive and creepy.  It was a little hard to believe that Abby would stay with someone SOOOOO over-protective and prone to outbursts.<br />Just my two cents- I still liked it!  :)
B007IX383I|5.0|I love this band!  They keep getting better and better.  I love the vocal harmonies.  Vincent and Lee have the<br />best voices I've heard in a rock band.  I wish this band was popular in the States I would love to see them live.  I highly recommend this album.
B000PKG6TE|5.0|Personally, when I first heard this album, I was extremely underwhelmed and gravitated towards the \\"hits\\" without really listening to the majority of the songs on the album. I did, however, begin to wonder what else was on the album the more each of the songs would come on my MP3 player as I was driving around. The main reason why I didn't listen to a lot of the songs, sadly, is because the majority of the intros to each of them were odd and reminded me of other stuff that I've heard from other artists that I never listened to. Once I heard \\"Into the Hollow\\", I realized immediately that this album has gold, and I went searching for more. I listened to the whole album through and fell in love with it. Lyrically, the album, in my opinion, is their best. Many of the lyrics are incredibly witty, while others are extremely deep. Never in my life have a heard an album like this where I smirk at so many lyrics because of how verbally \\"dirty\\" they are. The instrumentals, as well, are innovative and are on the verge of some delicious mixture of avant-garde sounds and prog rock, while still retaining the band's hard rock, psychedelic, stoner rock, and even some metal roots. They unleash more studio effects than ever in this album while still somehow allowing it to be their most raw sounding effort since their self-titled debut. The majority of the songs jump around with pacing, with a frenetic combination of speed and lax sound. In all, once you start listening to this album, you'll most likely find it difficult to stop because, as I said before, it's like finding hidden gold. Once you begin to experience it, you can never get enough.
B005EGXTEE|4.0|Been hearing a bit about this book because of the recent movie release which I still haven't seen. Thoroughly enjoyed, easy read, good pace and a different theme which kept you intrigued. Read the three books over one weekend so obviously quite enjoyed!! Reminded me a little of books I used to enjoy as a young reader like \\"Tomorrow, When the War Began\\".<br /><br />Subject matter definitely a little sad though, left me feeling a little subdued to be honest. But great read especially for those who like an easy read.
B007HQW7K6|5.0|This series does the books justice. Take them home. Breath-taking locales. Excellent casting, wardrobe. This series is the whole package.
B0086700CM|5.0|A working (HTC Evo 3D) Temple Run. I like it, the challenges and upgrades make me keep playing, I think You're doing good.
0345803485|5.0|It had me at chapter 3. I'm glad I gave it a chance, the wording could of been a bit better but then again the main character is 21. But I was kinda hooked on this right away, so much I had to buy book two right away to see what happened next.
B007PKSN6Q|4.0|Having just seen the movie, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the vocals.  The plot may have been a bit weak...but it is a MUSICAL!.....not a thriller!  The point is the music!  Being of a certain age where I can totally recall all of these bands the first time around, I loved hearing all these songs. I had to stop myself from singing along in the theater! lol  Every time a new song burst out, I was surprised by who was singing it and then by how well they were doing it!<br />Don't let the nay sayers stop you from checking this out.  If this is your type of music, check out the movie and give the CD a listen.
B0086700CM|5.0|fin gets boron eventually but meanwhile it was really fun some lagg on the kindle fire thought not sure why.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Smooth game play, hints and deal action. I recommend without hesitation. What's not to love? Its free. No hangs or freezes either.
B0079J28NW|5.0|I purchased Yellow Submarine, anticipating a substantial restoration, being the care taken with upgrading the Beatles music, as the restoration employed 4k, and DTS HD audio. Even with the bar set high, I sat, astounded by the result as I watched this film on my 55\\" LED. This presentation is as an impressionistic painting came to life.  According to the films addendum restoration credit, the restoration was completed frame -by frame, and is comparable to Criterion releases and superior to most High Definition remastered classics.<br /><br />Let us not forget the films audio. The soundtrack employs all the care that any Beatles commodity deserves. The Beatle classics, as well as George Martin compositions envelop the viewer, not by overkill, but rather by complementing the film. My audio equipment, for watching video is a sound bar with subwoofer, using a fiber optic connection.  By far, it is the best sounding Blu-Ray that I own.<br />The content of the film is appropriate for all ages, although the dialogue offers a few double entendre's for a mature viewers. It is nothing objectionable, just a few comments that may go over most kid's (and some adults) heads.<br />This film is for the generations!  Enjoy!
B007XNAQLA|5.0|An edit note...I have decided to give the recording five stars because it is exemplary (I have listened to it now, thanks to a friend who bought it). I still stand by my comments below because, while they are still amazing even just playing their old material, they obviously can be so much more. I guess I'm mostly upset with this 2nd live offering in a row because I have come to expect so much from this band. This album represent their youth and often for human beings the output of youth is the best they'll ever do (think Einstein)...but I don't believe it with RTF. I believe they have it in them to take this band to the next level, a level no one has ever heard before. And that is why I am critical of this album...because these guys are genius's who need to push themselves for their own betterment and for the joy of their long time, and not so long time fans!!!<br /><br />The rest is what I wrote a couple of days ago...<br /><br />First up, I'm a LONG time fan of RTF.<br /><br />I've seen RTF 5 times, the first was from the front row at the UCR gym in Riverside, CA in 1975 on the \\"No Mystery\\" tour, then in 1976 at Dorothy Chandler Pavillion in Los Angeles on the \\"Romantic Warrior\\" tour, then at the SDSU Open Air Ampitheater in San Diego on their first reunion tour in 1983, and then in 2008 and 2011 at the Paramount Theater in Seattle.<br /><br />I've been a knocked out fan for all of those years. The addition of Jean-Luc and Frank to the lineup in 2011 was a pretty amazing, and unforeseen regrouping too. I'd only seen Jean-Luc once before, in 1974 with the Mahavishnu Orchestra (one of the best concerts EVER!) so I was more than ready to see JLP again! Frank Gambale is a guitarist I've been a fan of since the early 90's, but had never seen live. Suffice it to say, it was with much anticipation that I attended that concert.<br /><br />Now for my brutal honesty!<br /><br />With the exception of JLP's \\"Renaissance\\", which is itself an old song, all of the offerings on\\"The Mothership Returns\\" are old songs...very old songs! That is of course not a bad thing, if you forget that the (last) CD they put out, after the 2008 tour, was a live recording of mostly vintage songs. Having seen RTF on \\"album tours\\", I have a very strong memory of new music always being part of what they did. They would of course include older songs as well, but the emphasis was usually on the new music. It was amazing hearing what are now classics, for the first time in a live setting! \\"The Mothership Returns\\" has none of that. It is an great recording I'm certain, of what they played on the 2011 tour, which involved no new music at all.<br /><br />The attitude that new music is essential now seems gone from RTF, and I tend to think it has something to do with Chick being burnt out on RTF after having played to too many guitar god crowds...just too many rude people yelling while they poured their hearts out (especially during their acoustic sets). Chick even admonished the crowd during the acoustic set I saw in 1976, to just \\"sit and listen\\". It was clear to me that Chick was annoyed with the rock and rollers and I've always felt that is why Romantic Warrior was their last tour for 7 years, and after 1983 why it took 25 years to return (with the DiMeola RTF). These intervals make me think that Chick really only came back for the money, and decided to do it the easy way, which was to simply resurrect their early music and not waste effort on new music. And so it has been with the 2008 and 2011 tours. They did offer a couple of new songs in 2008 (that I believe were written while on tour)...with none in 2011.<br /><br />I am so ready for a new album that these back to back live offerings are only frustrating in that respect. The first one \\"Returns\\" was great, because it appeared to point to a new phase. However, that phase never materialized. Then they came back with Gambale and Ponty and all I could think was YES...now they'll really mix it up with the addition of thes two stalwart fusion players/composers who will change the dynamic completely from the DiMeola RTF. I figured a tour would lead to a studio CD. They'd get warmed up on tour and then take that energy into a studio and then blow the doors off with music unlike anything they've done before!<br /><br />Sadly I was wrong. Nothing new, just rearrangements of songs they've played uncounted times in the last 36 years. They still have the potential to make it happen though, and I only hope that is the case. Until then though, I'm done with purchasing any more reshashes of old glories. Please, no more live recordings! It's time for some new music that will blow the minds of an entirely different generation!
B007MDB71O|4.0|Great writing with an all star cast lots of action and suspense a movie the whole family can really enjoy!
0345803485|1.0|I picked up this book because I heard all the hype surrounding it but honestly, the writing is horrible!!  The story is very unbelievable and corny...she blushes, she orgasms, he does everything perfectly, blah blah blah...I have no idea why people are so obsessed with this book...seriously.
B005LAIGTG|1.0|Yes, some lady in Indiana had amnesia and eventually married her former beau. That is where the \\"based on a true story\\" ends. The Vow decides to make our young couple hipsters living in a Chicago loft. He is a disc jockey and she is a claymation artist. McAdams, despite what some have said, really is annoying in this film. Her character makes you want to slap her out of her brain fart and back into reality. Tatum seems like a nice guy trying to rekindle the flame but she keeps acting weird about it.<br /><br />This is not a \\"chick flick\\". This is a stupid flick. Give women some credit.  I laughed when McAdams went flying through the windshield in super slo-mo. That's how bad this one was. And I am a big fan of the Notebook. The only good film McAdams has ever done. I actually would have enjoyed a chase scene through an airport. At least it would have brought some life to this sad sack of celluloid.

B007L6VR12|5.0|Set in 1965, Moonrise Kingdom is a stylized coming of age film that delivers on its promise to bring the viewer of any age back to the intensity of just-entering-adolescence love. That alone makes this an extraordinary film. In addition, the music and imagery are beautifully orchestrated to delight the senses. The casting, characters, and acting are superb. It is rare to have a film that puts together this much talent and then taps it to the fullest.<br /><br />Heavy hitters include the brilliant Edward Norton (for once watching his language and holding his temper) as an anal but dedicated troop leader, Bill Murray who in stark contrast to the young stars in this film, fails to find any joy whatsoever in his work in the law profession, wealth, family or beautiful surroundings. His dissatisfied wife (Frances McDormand who was the psychiatrist in Norton's first film Primal Fear), is also an attorney (the lawyer banter are some of the funniest lines in the film). Bruce Willis (who plays very well with child stars as he has a bit of child still left in him) is the bachelor, island cop who goes head-to-head with the chilling Tilda Swinton (white witch from Narnia) known only as \\"Social Services,\\" as she callously plans to put \\"the boy\\" in juvenile refuge to undergo shock therapy as needed.<br /><br />Despite the exceptionally strong adult cast, the two main child stars Sam and Suzy not only keep pace, but outshine the grownups with their unfailing loyalty and unconditional love for each other, both express an unthinking complete giving of themselves to one other. The film captures beautifully in the persons of these two intriguing social outcasts the experience of moving from being trapped in isolation into discovering and developing a union with another. I love how the two of them are so adult and wise in one way and still very much children, with childlike reasoning and priorities, e.g., Suzy runs away and packs a suitcase full of books and her kitten but not a change of clothes.<br /><br />The cast is rounded out by a boyscout troop with scouts having inappropriately derogatory names as we did in my youth - such as lazy eye for the boy with the eyepatch. Also true to life was how dangerous and unsupervised our childhoods were then. Seeing the boy jump from two story height onto a trampoline without a surrounding net or a single spotter in sight, for example, really brought me back. And interactions with our parents really were pretty much restricted to being called to the table for dinner. I loved seeing Suzy's little brothers (Irish triplets) while away the time with all of the board and other none electronic games, fueled by a couple of dice or imagination.<br /><br />Wes Anderson spins a simple, sweet story - yet the viewer never knows exactly where it is headed. Throughout, the film is subtly hilarious. In trademark Anderson fashion, the lines are delivered in an almost deadpan way with all the characters completely oblivious to the irony and ridiculousness of the situation, dialog, and even their lives and themselves. I highly recommend purchasing this movie; it's one you'll want to watch again and again and share with other people. I've already seen it four times and it hasn't even opened in theaters in my state, yet.of clothes.<br /><br />The cast is rounded out by a boyscout troop with scouts having inappropriately derogatory names as we did in my youth - such as lazy eye for the boy with the eyepatch.

B005GG0MIS|5.0|We all know far, far, too much about the presidents while they are, or were in office.  This book gives an entirely different side of their personality when living on the quiet side of politics.  Some presidents who appeared to be either winners or losers while in The White House come across as quite a bit different and therefore either more or less appealing.
B000H5TVJY|5.0|I'll start this review like I started other reviews: I absolutly love this movie! I won't go through explaining the movie like the other great reviews on this movie. I'll just say that this movie did have me a little confused. If hes not patrick bateman, who is he? And if his slaughtering of women is just a schizophrenic illusion then the whole movie is just in his mind. That makes this movie a big slap in the face just like when stewie took over the world on family guy. But its ok cause patricks \\"dark side\\" represents the killer in all of us who wants to rub out that coworker who outshines us, or that woman who needs to be\\" rewarded\\" for her stupidity. Sometimes I feel on the verge of frenzy, and cutting people up is the only cure for my bloodlust. Any way the movie is funny, gory, clever, and inspiring, to me anyway. You have to be a person of a certain mind state to understand this movie, and therefore appreciate the dark humor. The movie makes a fine addition to my collection and definetly, certifies christian bale as one of the best actors of our generation. I've seen it 15 times and still love it. If you are checking the reviews on this movie means you like this type of movie. Get it.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|its a great time killer, one of the best android games on the market.  its worth the money. you will not be disappointed.
B00899DR40|5.0|With the album only 5 dollars, it's a great buy. One of the best bonus tracks, \\"Maria\\", is also on amazon for another buck. All the bonus tracks are on amazon, so you could get the deluxe for only 8 bucks. The album is solid, with something to appeal to everyone, from the clubs with \\"All Around The World,\\" to old school Jackson 5 R&B with \\"Die In Your Arms.\\" If you buy the album, you should definitely buy \\"Maria\\" as well. \\"Maria\\" is basically Justin's \\"Billie Jean.\\" The only way I can describe the song is the lyrics of \\"Billie Jean\\" with the chorus sounding like Usher's \\"Yeah.\\" But this album is a great effort by Justin. There are definitely corny love songs, but he's Bieber. Great beats, great lyrics, can't wait for the next album.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|This is the movie that won the Nobel  and a couple of Oscars for Al Gore in 2007.<br /><br /> It is amazing, when you play to the emotions of the politically correct crowd with, of all the darn things, a slide presentation that purports to represent science, you win awards. No one asks if the science has any validity. No one asks why the presenter is presenting one untruth after another. There is an answer for that from these folks; it is the title of the movie, and the assertion that those who oppose this movie are deniers, like the folks who ran the tobacco companies, who denied the truth. It is time to pull the curtain back, and find out that OZ is the emperor who is wearing no clothes. It is just unknown whether Al Gore is OZ, or if someone else is pulling his strings.<br /><br /> A little way into the movie two graphs are shown that run across the screen, one on top of another. The top graph is the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, and the lower graph is the earth's temperature. The data is from a Siberian ice core and goes back 600 years. Al says that the two graphs look like each other, and says that CO2 causes the temperature to change.<br /><br /> Open question, why didn't he make the graphs in much shorter time frames, like 50,000 year increments, show 12 graphs then, make the lines much finer, and show them actually on top of each other?<br /><br /> If he did that, the actual data from those very same ice cores would show that the temperature goes up or down, and then the CO2 level goes up or down 800 to 1000 years later. In other words, the temperature causes the CO2 level to change, not the backwards, upside down, untruthful way that Al Gore presents it. The CO2 level is a trailing indicator of what the temperature has already done. Nothing more.<br /><br /> The first question to ask with the real data really presented properly, is why did Al get it wrong? Did he not ask the right questions? Did someone else give him this data and he just swallowed without asking any critical, scientific questions?<br /><br /> The second question is: if CO2 doesn't cause climate change AKA global warming, what does? The rest of the movie is just the rest of the wheels falling off the Global Warming wagon, and this movie.<br /><br /> In the same graph he projects a rise in CO2 this century (21st) almost vertically to unprecedented levels, with the assertion that the temperature must also climb vertically, and we will all melt (like we do every summer).<br /><br /> The scale of the graph is incredibly misleading. What is really happening is that 1,000 years ago was the medieval warming, and here we are, 1,000 years later, watching the CO2 level rise.<br /><br /> Something not presented in this data is that although the CO2 level that is increasing, as Al Gore shows earlier in this film, and we know about how much CO2 mankind in contributing, the actual, scientifically measured at the top of Mauna Loa by NASA, atmospheric level of CO2 is rising only about one-half as fast as it should be. No alarmist scientist will admit this, and they don't know what is happening to the CO2. See [[ASIN:1906768293 Climate: The Counter-Consensus - A  Palaeoclimatologist  Speaks (Independent Minds)]].<br /><br /> Al Gore also shows the infamous Mann curve, (the Mann hockey stick) which purports to show 1,000 years of Northern Hemisphere temperatures. The curve is fairly flat, and then it rises dramatically in the last 60 years or so. This curve has subsequently (2009) been completely debunked (see [[ASIN:1906768358 The Hockey Stick Illusion: Climategate and the Corruption of Science (Independent Minds)]]. Mann has been quite ungracious about how he (deliberately?) manipulated the scientific code to minimize and distort all of the data, starting with the medieval warming period, which was several degrees warmer than today, minimized and distorted the little ice age, and then did not show that global temperatures started recovering around 1700AD, andhave been slowly rising since then. The little ice age ended circa 1850AD. Mann's curve does not show the cooling that took place from circa 1940 through 1979, and the cooling that has actually taken place, per NASA satellite measurements, from 1999 through 2012. Why did Mann distort the data, and manipulate the code such that your grandma's cookie recipe would result in a hockey stick shaped graph. How was this absolute untruth presented to Al Gore? Why did he buy something that was absolutely false based on existing data before he made this movie?<br /><br /> Of course, the alarmists still believe the Mann curve is correct, as Mann still asserts. Science deniers, one and all.<br /><br /> Another false graph is the temperature since 1860, which does not show how the temperature has been slowly, unevenly, declining after 1998. Gore asserts that 2005 is the hottest year recorded during this time. That is an absolute untruth. Per NASA satellite data. Which was available in 2005. Why the distortion, manipulation of actual scientific data? Alarmists like to say something like 11 of the warmest years have been in the last 13 years, and that the absolute 5 warmest are 2005, 1998, 2002, 2003, and 2007. Once again, with the exception of 1998, this is absolutely false, invented, data. Did no one bother to go back to NASA and check their actual measurements? (See [[ASIN:1453864725 What Warming?: Satellite View of Global Temperature Change]]).<br /><br /> Climategate happened in late 2009, so Al Gore can't be blamed, but it is emblematic of the entire movement of which Gore is major player. Climategate was a bunch of E-mails from the alarmist cabal at East Anglia University, the main suppliers of information to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to each other. There were two main issues. The first, is how could they present the data to show that there actually was global warming, when there had been no global warming since 1998. I.E., how could they manipulate the data to fool the public. The second, was that they deliberately manipulated computer code to display the data, no matter what it was, the way they wanted it to turn out. They are not scientists, they are charlatans who should be tarred and feathered and ridden out of town on a rail!<br /><br /> The preceding folks should give everyone pause about everything presented in this movie.<br /><br /> Al starts out with pictures of the earth from space, and how fragile our planet is. He then covers some real simple, almost childish, basics about the sun and our atmosphere. Then he hits the graphs, as outlined previously. Included within are pictures of ice melting. Mount Kilimanjaro, in Africa, has a snowy top. The snow coverage has been declining. However, not because Kilimanjaro is not cold enough, but rather because of moisture wind patterns that have little or nothing to do with climate change.<br /><br /> He shows pictures of glaciers and arctic ice. Yes, some glaciers are melting. Others are growing. We have been warmer before, and the glaciers did just fine. We are not going to inundate our oceans with a sudden surge of fresh water that will destroy the oceans circulation patterns. Arctic ice minimized in 2007, in time to win a Nobel. Since then the arctic ice has been slowly increasing. During the medieval warming, Chinese ships sailed across the arctic and saw no ice. No ice is no problem. He talks about, and shows, polar bears swimming forever, and not finding any ice. Polar bears are doing just fine, their numbers have increased dramatically over the last 50 years or so. They did fine 1,000 years ago, they have done fine for millions of years, and they are doing fine today. What is not good is a real ice age, with glaciers a mile high, as Gore explains, but he doesn't explain that Polar Bears, and mankind, really don't do so good during cold periods, and we do great during warming periods, such as the current time. He believes the Antarctic's ice is also melting because a couple of ice shelves fell into the ocean. As they have done before. They rebuild, and then they fall into the ocean again. Yawn. So what.<br /><br /> Katrina (the hurricane) was bad. Mainly it showed that a city that is below sea level that doesn't pay enough attention to its dykes is going to run into trouble. Katrina was not especially powerful, and if it had hit anywhere else, it would have been a normal bad hurricane. The assumption that global warming, the warm waters of the gulf, are the primary causative factor for hurricane formation is flat out false. Of course all the years since 2005 have shown a decline in Hurricane activity and intensity. 2005 was not especially abnormal, except for Katrina hitting New Orleans just wrong.<br /><br /> He shows a graph of population, showing it peaking out at around 9.1 billion people circa 2050. The indicated belief is that there are too many people on the earth for our resources. Current UN data indicates that it will peak around 2050 at about 8 billion people, and then start declining as Europe, the Middle East, Japan, and some other areas and countries start demographically disappearing. Having a whole continent with no people on it, except Islamists, as Europe will be next century, will be a whole new and entirely too interesting a challenge.<br /><br /> He thinks that diseases will move north and cause epidemics. Insects and other species will migrate and upset the balance everywhere.<br /><br /> Our ancestors, in Egypt in 2300BC, in Greece, in 1250BC, in Rome, in 1AD, in Europe in 1200AD, were all in warm eras, lived through everything Al Gore is decrying, and all thrived until the cold temperatures came back. We have been here before and we have survived just fine. During the Pliocene, the current inter-glacial period, it was warmer 10,000 years ago, and has been slowly cooling since then. No year, with or without man made CO2, has been or will be as warm as 10,000 years ago.<br /><br /> Over 85% of the earth's global warming is actually caused by water vapor, with that mostly happening within 30 feet of the earth's surface. Only 0.2% is caused by CO2. Al Gore is chasing a chimera. Of course, trying to do something about water vapor is just not sexy. You can't destroy modern civilization by working on water vapor.<br /><br /> Taking the long view, CO2 concentrations 150 million years ago, during warm and cold periods, was over 4,000PPM, 15 times higher than today, and the dinosaurs did just fine. The Earth should have dies, per Al. But we are here today. Oops!<br /><br /> Al quotes a study done that shows that there is a consensus of scientists that support global warming caused by man. The study was a Google search. It is meaningless. There is no scientific consensus, there has been no consensus, and there will be never be a consensus. Besides, a consensus is meaningless. What matters is the science. A consensus of scientists means that nobody is thinking anymore.<br /><br /> Al Gore relaters the story of the Tobacco Company executives and their testimony before congress. The executives all stated that there was doubt about the science that tobacco was bad for you, and he equates the folks like me, who actually know the science, with those executives, thus we are called deniers. I would urge everyone to read The Deniers, which is about scientists who knew, in their narrow field, that there was no global warming, but thought overall there was, until they compared notes with other scientists, and found out it was all a house of falsehoods.<br /><br /> This movie is a total sham: a fabrication. Did Al Gore deliberately manipulate the data, or did he just uncritically accept the deliberately manipulated data? What matters is that the Alarmists are wrong now, they will be wrong tomorrow, and they are the real, malevolent, science deniers.e the data to fool the public.

0345803485|1.0|I highly recommend that you try the sample version before wasting money. If you find the writing immature, stale, repetitive, and the characters one-dimensional... Trust me, it doesn't get any better than that.<br /><br />Now... Here's my rant.... Pardon spelling/grammar mistakes- bloody iPhones and typing blah blah...<br /><br />Where to begin? First, I'll state that I love a good,sexy-schmexy book.. BUT (yes, a huge but) this book was horrid. The heroine,<br />If you'd call her that, was so single-minded and boring. This chick seemed incapable of having more than one thought running through her head- and that thought  was simply \\"Mr.Gray\\". The only things that stand out about her is the fact that she never had any intimate encounters or relationships, she is a virgin that has never even touched herself in an intimate way, and that she's ungraceful and awkward when it<br />Comes to dealing with Gray.<br /><br />Are we supposed to believe that a woman in her twenties, who has never experimented with sex or masturbation, suddenly has all of these carnal<br />Thoughts about this ONE attractive guy she just met? And, are we supposed to believe that she, who has such an innocent mind, would really be so complacent when she understood fully what kind of sex he was into and the agreement of their \\"contract\\"?<br /><br />Mr.Gray seems to be more than he is. We're led to think that he is overwhelmingly mysterious, handsome, rich, young, the perfect fantasy. However, he doesn't have much in the way of personality. He is a glorified stalker-turned into overpowering/dominant/jealous man. To add a dash of spice, I suppose, he is a bit of a contradiction in the way that he funds some charity projects, and keeps doings things that \\"he has never done before\\" when it comes to Ana.<br /><br />The writing itself seemed immature, while the content was erotica/romance. Horrid horrid horrid combination. It was like reading the journal of a 13 year old. Yikes. I don't understand what thehype is all about. I won't be reading the rest of the series. Pass
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|Having lived in Barrow, Alaska for over 25 years, I was especially struck by the Arctic-like background in this film. The harsh tone of a distant Arctic land (actually Iceland) can grab the viewer.I went back to the movie theater twice after the first viewing and still marveled at the cold and dangerous place.<br /><br />Director Ridley Scott once again showed his touch for the artistic and stunning. He also did the original 1979 film and then no more. Like some other reviewers I long felt that \\"Alien\\" was one of the best all-time science fiction movies. Right there with 2001,and in some ways much better.<br /><br />Scott said he wanted to go back and find out more about that giant pilot with an exploded chest in a crashed ship on a distant moon. Where was that alien from, and on what kind of mission?<br /><br />To make up for lost time, Scott loads Prometheus with lots of high-tech, plot and characters (the ship now has a crew of 17.) But you will still find the evil corporation reps there, along with a very determined Ripley type, played by Noomi Rapace of \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo.\\" She really carries on the Ripley determination. And don't forget the robot---here identified right from the start. But which side is he on?<br /><br />There is a new dimension to the Alien story which where prehistoric cave paintings seem to point toward that distant moon, and our ancestors (or creators?)<br /><br />Lots of excitement, and  very scary moments.<br /><br />You might wonder whether the certain sequel to this prequel will develop the distant ancestors as the prime feature. Such questions can lead to many ideas while you are out on a summer night with your telescope, or naked eye, just looking at the stars. And wondering.<br />Earl

B0058YPL66|5.0|I really didn't want to watch this show because I assumed it would be a typical prime time show (cliche/predictable) and probably immature (as in intended for children). I'm glad I didn't allow assumptions to stop me because I was pleasantly surprised. The merger of fairy tales with contemporary society, the format of how the show cuts between two realities, along with the excellent costumes, fx and acting has produced an amazingly refreshing and unique show. It's been a long time since I was simply entertained from watching tv. This is good old fashioned story telling at its finest. I've actually watched it twice through and am starting again on the third. Each episode is packed with so much that you can watch the series more than once and not be bored. In fact, during a second viewing of the series you'll have different expectations and episodes will take on new meanings not caught the first time. Any show that I can watch more than once is a winner. I'll definitely be purchasing the dvds and eagerly await season two.
B00004U60I|2.0|After receiving Baby Beethoven as a gift for my daughter, she loved it and we decided to collect them all.  This one, however, is one of the worst.  There's very little activity to keep her attention for long.  Ths little girls in it are cute, but they don't really do much,  I would pick Beethoven & Mozart over this one anyday!

B0070NSPCU|5.0|I often read books from unfamiliar authors based solely on 5 star reviews, and I often find they do not live up to the hype. This is not one of those books.. It has earned every single star!<br /><br />Other reviews have done a much better job describing the story, so I will simply say this book was fun to read, hard to put down, and the plot kept me guessing from start to finish. I found myself relating to the characters, and caring about thier fate.  The combat and tactics seemed very believable and true to the time periods, which I rarely see in fantasy.<br /><br />I would say that if the author continues to develop the larger plots with as much skill as he showed here, this series will be on my top 5 fantasy list with Game of Thrones, Wheel of Time, The Dresden Files, and The Sword of Truth. More please!

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I've read a variety of erotica since I was in 6th grade and started on Harlequin novels. I've graduated since then and always look to find something more enjoyable or unique from the previous. However, this book - this trilogy in fact - had me transported back to 6th grade. For me at least, it truly felt like a stretched out Harlequin novel, and while my own um, inner goddess was looking forward to the romance, sex, and BDSM that I thought would take place in the coming pages (after reading the 1000 page contract btw), I was sorely disappointed. As a result, I am now rereading the Beauty Trilogy that Anne Rice wrote to fill that void.<br /><br />I personally don't get it. I don't understand how this book became such a sensation. The terms used in the book are not appropriate for a story set in America, it's incredibly repetitiousness, the characters are truly so unbelievable and unrelatable I had a lot of trouble connecting with them. The sex was bland - I assumed it would build to so much more afterwards but it did not (there was one sexcapade with an anal plug. Woo!). I assume many of the people that love and embrace the trilogy aren't big readers of erotica. Well, if your inner goddess got tickled from this, wait til you REALLY get out there and start reading the good stuff.<br /><br />I know I'm the minority here but the accolades from the public really has me scratching my head.  I heard some say this book improved their sex life at home...? It really did? Like, how? Did you cut up your husband's jeans and make him wear it, make him use his business ties on you, did you roll your eyes a million times at him until he beat you with a paddle? I'm just kidding of course. The book does have a few good moments but really not enough to make me a fan.<br /><br />I finished the trilogy because I downloaded them all at once and thought the later books would be much better, however that was not the case for me. I'm happy for the author's success but feel a little insultedthat this level of writing is what creates a sensation. In addition to that may I just vent I'm also annoyed that on Pinterest and Facebook every freaking male brunette celebrity I see without fail has a caption along the lines of \\"He'd be the perfect Christian Grey!\\" Augh!!<br /><br />Just my opinion of course, nothing more. My personal recommendation would be to borrow the book(s) if you can if you want to know what the fuss is about, since no doubt you can't escape hearing about it :)
B001HNE3NO|5.0|What Sarah's Key is about, In 1942 there is a knock at the door, the police are arresting Jews. Sarah's family think they are safe because they live in Paris but they were not. The police have no idea that Sarah's little brother is there in the house so Sarah locks him in their secret hiding place. Thinking she will be back for him in a few days. Sarah's life at that moment is turned upside down. To read the synopsis of Sarah's Key from Goodreads click HERE<br /><br />What I love about this book is the plot, the characters and the writing! There was not one thing that I didn't like about Sarah's Key by Tatiana De Rosnay. It was to put plainly \\"freaking amazing\\" I cried a ton in this book. So bring your tissues with you.<br /><br />To start, author Tatiana De Rosnay is an amazing writer, to execute a book that reads past to present then back again is one hard job. Most books that I've read with past chapter 1 then present chapter 2, I find I pick a side that is more entertaining. I either really love the past and in reading the present chapters cannot wait to get back to the past, if that makes any sense at all but I loved both in this book. I was not confused, I found both past and present equally entertaining.<br /><br />The characters I found a little of myself in all of them.Sarah's character, desperate to protect her younger brother, I don't have a younger brother but protection of my family is a must. Sarah's story is heart pulling, lovely and such a loving story. My heart was fully invested in this because I have a daughter named Sarah, what a tragic event for a little girl to know that she locked her brother in a cabinet, when will she get back at every minute every hour her worry as a sister who only wanted to do good. Her pain, her life changed in so many ways that night. Sarah was robbed of a childhood, robbed or her innocents. Pain set in and relief from that pain was never to come. How dare that happen, how dare people stand by and watch, how dare that ever have taken place in history.<br /><br />How does Sarah's story lead into the present there is a journalist that is looking into the \\"round up\\" the looked over \\"round up\\" no one talks about in 1942 with Jews in Paris. She has no idea that investigating this event will not only change her but her world around her.<br /><br />My favorite part of the story without spoiling this for all our readers. Julia the journalist in the present makes a decision in the story that takes my breath away in fact I was quite mad about it, at that moment I was going to stop the book with my anger towards Julia. However I kept reading and Julia turns her life around remembering for once what she wants and what is important, I was so glad I didn't stay mad at Julia. I was so inspired by her strength in that matter.<br /><br />To have that connection for me to take Julia's decision so personally made me know just how much I connected with this book. If you are interested in historical fiction, Holocaust history this is the book for you. A must read for all readers who want a story that starts with a tragedy and ends with a triumph!ver have taken place in history.<br /><br />How does Sarah's story lead into the present there is a journalist that is looking into the \\"round up\\" the looked over \\"round up\\" no one talks about in 1942 with Jews in Paris.

0486284735|5.0|What a wonderful book! This book was even better the 2nd time and now that I have brushed up on my P&P, I will hopefully be reading Mr. Darcy's Obsession next month. I love the book, \\"pride and prejudice\\" it's a wonderful story about a family in the 1700's and the classes of society. Reminds us how different things were. Has a Dramatic story with a beautiful classic love story intertwined. If I was to chose a modern day version of this book it would be Bridget Jones Diary, because she is in love with the man who is not who he seems to be, despises another man who she sees so wrong. Ends up falling in love with the man she thought of as a horrible man. What a great read. I also love my new book light! Target 9.99 was the best investment ever. I was surprised I was able to finish this book while we had company here, but with a few sleepless nights I breezed right through this book. I give this book 5 stars
B005LAIHRC|5.0|Adam Shankman struck gold with the movie musical \\"Hairspray\\" some years ago, and now he has released his first movie musical since, the similarly star-driven, but completely different \\"Rock of Ages\\". This film, like \\"Hairspray\\", is based on a popular Broadway musical, but the big difference is that this is a jukebox musical, using songs made famous by big names from the 1980's glam metal scene, such as Journey, Foreigner, Def Leppard, Twisted Sister, Poison and Pat Benetar.  In my opinion, this film didn't feel as fresh as \\"Hairspray\\" did years ago, but it really didn't need to. It's decadent, beautiful, delightfully trashy, sentimental and heartfelt when it needs to be, exponentially silly and delightful the entire way through. The energy of its wonderful cast is inescapable and exuberant.<br /><br />The storyline is all over the place - clearly disjointed and unorganized, but I don't go see musicals expecting a fantastic story, so that can be forgiven. The musical numbers are completely top notch. I had been against mash-ups in musical theater and film, since the American public will more than likely associate a mash-up with something trying to be \\"Glee\\" or trying to be a rip-off of that horrible TV show. It's important for me to mention right here that this show was on Broadway long before \\"Glee\\" became a thing. It was awesome then and it's awesome now.<br /><br />The story follows the young and naive Sherrie (Julianne Hough) who moves to Los Angeles from some small town in the height of the hair/glam metal scene in 1987. She meets and falls in love with city boy Drew (Diego Boneta). She works with him at The Bourbon Room, which is basically a fictitious version of CBGB's. Dennis (Alec Baldwin) and Lonny (Russel Brand) own the club, which is getting alot of attention during rockstar Stacee Jaxx (Tom Cruise)'s band's last show. The uppity religious conservative wife of the mayor (Catherine Zeta Jones) wants to shut the club down. And a whole bunch of other stuff happens too. Like I said, the story isn't that organized.<br /><br />Each actor of this ensemble displays irresistible energy, no matter how small or unimportant-seeming their role might be. For example, take Mary J Blige, who plays a character so small, I didn't catch her name. She's an R&B singer who took acting lessons for this film. Once her character is introduced more than halfway into the film, they use her terrific singing voice every chance they get. She had a lot of enthusiasm, and without the enthusiasm that the film's smaller actors provided, the final product of this film would not have been as satisfying as it was.<br /><br />Julianne Hough from \\"Dancing with the Stars\\" and recent movie musicals \\"Burlesque\\" and \\"Footloose\\" does a fine job. She isn't anything incredible or revolutionary, but she does her job fairly well and she has good enthusiasm, even as an actress, not just a singer. Her love interest Drew, played by Diego Boneta is pretty extraordinary, however. He has top-notch singing abilities, and his character is immediately likable whenever the film begins. I'm quite glad they didn't use anyone from the Disney stock for this role, like Zac Efron or one of the Jonas brothers. It so easily could have been done wrong.<br /><br />I'm not too fond of Tom Cruise, I think he's a highly overrated actor who in general isn't all that great. However, he does an excellent job as Stacee Jaxx, the fictitious \\"rock god\\" who has done some wonderful work in music years before, but doesn't know what to do with his life anymore. I'm not really sure which singer Cruise was channeling in this role, but he pretty much sums up what the decade meant for rock `n roll. Jaxx is a womanizing, heavy-drinking, lying, cheating sleazeball, like so many stars of that era were. But the surprising part is that Tom Cruise can really, and I mean really sing, particularly evidenced by his fantastic rendition of \\"Wanted Dead or Alive\\".<br /><br />It's so great to see that after allof these years, Catherine Zeta-Jones is still Velma Kelly. As the film's main antagonist, she plays a great character to scowl at, however her singing abilities are a bit underused, as she only sings two songs in the film. Alec Baldwin and Russel Brand have alot of fun playing characters that might surprise you. I never really pictured either of them as a singer, but they somehow pull it off, and so does Malin Akerman, who also plays a smaller role, but does a nice job with what she has.<br /><br />While the story of \\"Rock of Ages\\" leaves a bit to be desired, and the movie heavily differs from the play that inspired it, I found myself wanting to sing along to the music, and I was in awe of the choreography and vocal ranges of the fantastic cast. The story could have been strung together in a way that didn't suggest that it only existed so the selected songs could be sung, but that's about the only thing I found wrong with it, and with a musical that has a set list as fantastic as this one, it's easy to overlook. Just like the poster suggests, it really is \\"nothin' but a good time\\"!<br /><br />Grade: A-
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book is a great, easy read for someone who wants to indulge in a sexy, far fetched story. Yes, it's cheesy. Yes, it's smut. And, yes, my boyfriend made fun of me for reading it, but in the end, I think he's happy I did. So, be content knowing that a breathtaking  billionaire probably won't seduce you, but you can spice up your sex life with ideas from this book.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Got this game free as the app of the day but after playing it I would definitely pay for it. I've been playing it nonstop and I love it! Fun for hours and high replay value. I'm going back through courses again and again trying to beat my score and unlock prizes. I rarely ever rate apps but this one takes the cake. Get it...you will love it if you like golf games especially.
B0053O89WY|5.0|This is one of the best shows on today. It is witty, funny, and still fresh even after 5 seasons. The addition of more females to the cast was a very well-played move. Bernadette and Amy really add a whole wonderful level to the show. The 5th season has big name guest stars such as Wil Wheaton, Brent Spiner, and Leonard Nimoy !

B004H83IM8|3.0|so that other consumers are not misled... this IS a 'full screen' edition of these movies... that's the aspect ratio of old-style television and computer monitors --- NOT wide-screen as shown in movie theaters (1.85) or typical HDTVs (1.77).  Fortunately I was able to cancel my order when I realized my mistake.  Consumers who purchase this expecting to see the full theatrical release scale will be very disappointed.  of course, 1.77 still cuts off the side edges slightly, but it's a heck of a lot better than 1.33.<br /><br />I am rating this product at a \\"3\\" because it *is* a \\"full screen\\" release which is not entirely fair to the product, since it clearly states that that is what it is.  However i feel consumers will be misled by the first review, and also I really hate it when they muck with any of the original production qualities (including colorizing old b/w) so blowing a big raspberry on this one.  As i said, not entirely fair, but I didn't want to give it a five star rating either, since I haven't purchased it, I'm simply correcting some misleading information.

B000NTPDSW|4.0|I have to say I love the godfather trilogy. I purchased the collection on DVD way before the Coppola restoration came out and I just loved them. I have seen each movie at least 6-7 times a year since I bought them.<br />With them coming out on blu-ray, I was really having high expectations that the movies would look great in 1080p. Boy was I wrong (with the exception of the godfather 3 but I'll get into that later)<br />The first and second movie looked exactly as the DVD version did, though maybe not as grainy in some parts but for the most part, it looked identical, the sound and color had been enhanced a bit but nothing that said \\"WOW\\" to me. I can totally understand why, the technology wasn't present when they filmed them over 30 years ago, but come on, this was billed as \\"like you've never seen\\" and it wasn't.<br />The third movie was great in my opinion, others my disagree but I thought that it was filled with as much deceit, intrigue, and murder as the others before it. Maybe this one was too much centered on action and the needless inclusion of Sophia Coppola (Why Francis why?)  as Michael's Daughter. but anyways, back to the review. The picture looks totally better than the dvd version. I could actually see fine detail that I didn't think I could.<br /><br />So should you buy this Blu-ray box set?<br />yes-only if you don't have the dvd version.<br />no- if you have the dvds, don't bother, except for the third movie.<br /><br />And as always, never fear your enemy.

B005LAIIS0|1.0|Why bother with suffering through a bad plot, thin acting, and hype? The crash scene is okay and its Alaska - the scenery is outstanding. Nothing can save this film from B movie rating though. It's more of a lesson on what not to do if you want to survive a plane crash in the wilderness.
B005HWUCMC|1.0|This is not Amazons fault, but if you buy Rihanna's 5th album, Loud, make sure you buy it in MP3 form. I bought the CD because I prefer CDs over MP3's but apparently Rihanna's \\"Loud\\" does not have an Explicit version in physical CD form. This makes me angry because her musics all choppy because she cusses in about 7 of the songs. It is so hard to listen to the album and not be frustrated. Worst idea Rihanna and her producer's ever came up with.  If you want this Rihanna album, please buy it through mp3. Save yourself the headache (:
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|This is Bruce Springsteen's best new album since, at the very least, The Rising a decade ago. In fact, a good argument can be made that Wrecking Ball is a better album. Either way, any Springsteen fan will be happy with this purchase.

B00064WSN2|4.0|In Spite of the crumbling of the original Crimson lineup at the end of the American tour in '69, and thus as well starting a trend in interchanging lineups with every subsquent Crimson release thereafter, In the Wake of Poseidon is proven as a superior follow-up to the classic, groundbreaking release of In the Court of debut album. Although, its been compared as a vastly inferior and almost identical companion to the debut album, which does follow somewhat of a formula throughout the duration of itself, the musicianship is impeccable, and Robert Fripp manages to hold the glue together on this release with interesting tracks like Cadence and Cascade(featuring lead vocals from Gordon Haskell, whom turns up on the follow-up Lizard), Cat Food and The Devil's Triangle. Devil's Triangle began life as an improvisation piece largely composed by Ian McDonald and Fripp and known in its early stages as Mars. With the help of Mel Collins' assistance on sax and flute, coupled with the piano embellishments from Keith Tippet and Fripp's innovative usage of the mellotron and guitar passages, this piece stands out as another early Crimson classic realized.<br /><br />This record would also prove to be Greg Lake's farewell album as he would move onto bigger and better things with Carl Palmer and Keith Emerson; yet his vocalizing is definitive on the album's centerpieces, Pictures of a City, the title track and the hypertension pop/jazz of Cat Food, which is aided by the structured ramshackle ivory tinklings of Keith Tippet, along with Fripp's acoustic guitar rhythm melody and advant-garde electric guitar parts adding color and texture to this quirky number. The record is accentuated by 3 quiet interludes in the beginning, middle and end of the album's duration into Peace-A Beginning, Peace-A Theme and Peace-An End which add a bit more of an overall cohesiveness to the record as a whole and are driven by Lake's vocals and simple sparse acoustic parts courtesy of Fripp; it makes the listening experience even more desirable after further rotations, despite the similarity to its predecessor in certain parts. Poseidon certainly carries a more consistency than its follow up Lizard would display, as well as into the fourth release Islands, but those will be reviewed upon accordingly in due course to better explain my reasonings for this. I give Poseidon 4 stars for its courage, consistency and musical intelligence as it displays the power that still existed within the entity known as King Crimson.
B007P6VLRS|1.0|I was looking forward to this one. I had heard it was Billy's big comeback. A few early reviews were saying it was the best SP album since Mellon Collie, so my hopes were up pretty high. When I finally got to listen to the album I just couldn't have been disappointed more. I had to force myself to listen all the way through. I found the music it's self to be quite boring. I particularly dislike the vocals because the multitracking was so annoying, almost as annoying as the overuse of synthesizers. I honestly just don't see why any one would give this thing a good review. I didn't find any thing enjoyable about this album. I think it's fair to compare it to the old albums because so many people are saying it is the best since Mellon Collie, but it just doesn't stack up to the good SP albums.
B00065MDSQ|5.0|Unfortunately, this era of the group ended too abruptly as I personally feel the material recorded with the Wetton/Bruford lineup is certainly the most concise, powerful,talented and of equal measure to the promise of the Lake/Giles/McDonald first album era was(also much too brief). Red is the 3rd installment of this lineup and matches the bar set by Lark's Tongues in Aspic and Starless and Bible Black culminating in a record that displays the talents of its members, even Ian McDonald returns on a few tracks, lending his alto sax voicings to One More Red Nightmare and the album's closer Starless. The title track is of major significance and would even return to prominence in later reformations of Crimson in the future as an important and powerful number displayed. Robert Fripp's guitar arrangements remain innovative, dark and mysterious as ever along with the percussive talents of Bill Bruford and the drive of John Wetton's propulsive and solid bass lines along with his strong vocalizings on Fallen Angel and the aforementioned tracks Starless and One More Red Nightmare. For fans of the prog/rock genre whom like their music a bit darker in places with a sense of spontaneous improvisation mixed in, Crimson and this disc, Red, is right up your alley. Highly recommended. 5 stars
B0086700CM|5.0|Great app! Perfect to pass time, although it can be addicting!! surprised that this runs so well for a free app. definitely recommend this to all!
B00007KWHN|4.0|With the sacking of Peter Banks and the replacement incumbant Steve Howe joining the ranks, Yes are set on a course of innate and profound musical discovery. The Yes Album is the first important step towards hallmark releases like the follow-up Fragile and my personal favorite, Close To The Edge, and ultimately points towards the archetypal Yes sound and offers up some quality tracks such as Starship Trooper and I've Seen All Good People, which have remained live staples ever since. The previous releases Time and a Word and the self-titled debut showed the group's collective first steps, while also still displaying a searching quality amongst themselves and are noble sets, but the Yes Album ultimately achieves the first goal of a definitive Yes sound and Yours is No Disgrace leads the charge with interesting chord progressions and offers up semi-classical overtones in the record's closer Perpetual Change(another personal fav. of mine) while displaying the interplay of the group and Howe's guitar prowess is thoroughly realized even on the solo acoustic live take of his own compsoition The Clap which meshes country/western twang with a sense of the aforementioned semi-jazz/classical overtones that makes for an interesting hybrid of newfound interpretation.<br /><br />The only track that has dated badly is the middling contemporary take of A Venture, while performance-wise is completely competent and sharp, is also slightly derivitive in its hippyish naivete and is my least favorite track on the record. Most Yes fans recognize this as the first \\"true\\" Yes album, although I think it a bit unfair to underscore Peter Banks' earlier contributions to the previous releases; there are certainly some catalystic moments on those records that provided stepping stones for the achievements of this record, nonetheless. All told, however, The Yes Album is most definitely the most focused and purposeful release that provided an important step for the band to grow ever more forward within the movements of modern music. 4 stars
B007J4T2G8|1.0|First off, the author is geographically handicapped.<br /><br />Secondly, Elon Musk's descriptive vocabulary, I guess, is to be about 25 words. Which are used to the EXTREME maximum that is utterly tolerable. I wanted to shoot myself in the face about 20 pages in.<br /><br />Thirdly, I'm pretty sure I could watch a  stereotypical porn on the internet, write the plot/characters EXACTLY the same as the porno and have a better book than this. Which I may do, because this author is making bank and has the diction of a 14 year old.<br /><br />Fourthly, I guess I'm probably comparing this book to the MOVIES of TWILIGHT, and not the books as I luckily have never read them. I'm comparing this to the hours that I was forced to painfully endure in the movie theater in watching the \\"saga\\"<br /><br />Fifthly, nobody in the United States of America, speaks in any sense of the language used in this book. American's do not speak Queen's English (for lack of a better term)<br /><br />Sixly, I could see why this book is getting rave reviews by women. I guess if you unsatisfied with your mundane sex life, OR your scared to bare that your a naturally into BDSM and a freak in the sheets, OR your a 40 year old virgin, or your a catholic Priest/nun or anything devoted to the life of celibacy,than I'm sure you would love this. If everyday I had to come home to the same life, and the same sexually boring life...I would probably like this book. A 21 year old virgin who doesn't masturbate, yeah...ok. There are chicks on the regular getting preggers at 14.<br /><br />And finally, I guess if you like fictional porn BDSM \\"romance\\" and hate your sexual partner or are any of the items listed in the \\"sixly\\" catagory, then yeah you'd probably like this book.<br /><br />My personal opinion, the author is horrible, no fact checking, horrible geographics, REPETITIVE REPETITIVE REPETITIVE REPETITIVE REPETITIVE REPETITIVE REPETITIVE DESCRIPTIVE WORDS. If you are able to read this book past the 3rd chapter, please reply with your phone number, because you are a naughty girl. And that's ok by me.
0553386794|5.0|If you start this book, like I did, because you could not wait for HBO to finish the TV series - you will be disappointed. The \\"Game of Thrones\\" story is still not completed in written form, and is not expected to be finished for a few more years. As I understand it there are still two more books yet to be written. Personally, I will find it difficult to keep the multitude of characters and plots organized in my memory.<br />  Having said that, the yarn is a most engrossing read and I found almost all the books very difficult to put down.<br />  Enjoy!

0547569653|4.0|Scott Jurek didn't have an easy, lazy childhood.  His mother became ill and his father has to work, so Scott ends up taking care of his younger siblings.  He chops wood, learns to cook, and becomes self-sufficient.  While I would never advocate a child losing his/her childhood completely, it would be lovely if more children were tasked with chores and responsibilities at an early age.<br /><br />He begins running as an adolescent in order to escape the pressures of his daily life and to condition himself for cross-country skiing.  At first he hates running, but over time grows to love it and it becomes his main sport.  He realizes that he becomes stronger the longer he runs, rather than the other way around.<br /><br />Thus begins a career of ultrarunning - running distances over that oh-so-easy 26.2 miles (having never run more than a mile, I am being facetious.)  Jurek has ran and won races that are over 100 miles on a regular basis.<br /><br />Jurek became a vegan when he took up distance running seriously.  At the end of each chapter, he features a training tip and a vegan recipe.<br /><br />What I loved most, though, was the wisdom that Jurek imparts.  He's clearly a very deep person who has learned a lot over his lifetime.<br /><br />Some of my favorite quotes:<br />*What we eat is a matter of life and death.  Food is who we are.<br />*Difficulty would help.  It had always helped.  I was finally figuring that out.  All the whys in the universe hadn't granted me peace or given me answers.<br />*You could carry your burdens lightly or with great effort.<br />*Now we sit.  We drive and surf on the internet and watch television. And naturally, we suffer.<br />*Whether you get what you want isn't what defines you.  It's how you go about your business.<br />*We all lose sometimes.  We fail to get what we want. Friends and loved ones leave.  We make a decision we regret.  We try our hardest and come up short.  It's not the losing that defines us.  It's how we lose.  It's what we do afterward.<br /><br />The only reason I've given it 4 over 5 stars is that there were times that the book felt very long.  But overall, highly recommend.It's what we do afterward.<br /><br />The only reason I've given it 4 over 5 stars is that there were times that the book felt very long.  But overall, highly recommend.
B007N0REX6|5.0|Miles and Slash are a perfect match and the songwriting is at a very high level on this release. I didn't care for Slash's prior CD with the various vocalists, but this one was a pleasant surprise. This is hard rock done right with lots of energy, soaring vocals and killer riffs. The choruses and hooks get stuck in your head and you want to listen to it over and over. There is not a bad track on here...and the extra tracks on the deluxe version are great too.<br /><br />If you like other great current rock bands like Sixx A.M., Hardcore Superstar and Voices of Extreme...then you will like this. If you liked Guns N Roses...then you SHOULD like this unless you are hung up on Axl being gone....but Miles sounds great, your loss.
030758836X|5.0|I'm surprised that there are some negative reviews of this book, but to each their own.<br /><br />The story is told from both Nick's and Amy's viewpoints; one takes a chapter and then the next chapter is by the other.  Nick and Amy have been married for five years today.  Nick has breakfast with his wife, leaves, and then returns to find her missing.  Thus begins the quest to find out what happened to Amy and whom is responsible.<br /><br />When I first started this book, I thought, wow, this is going to be a looooooong book.  I was sure that I had figured out who the culprit was and I read ahead (as I typically do) to see if I was right.  I'm probably right about 75% of the time.  But I wasn't even close on this one.<br /><br />If you're looking for a book that will really screw with your mind, similar to the movie Memento, this book is it. I'm keeping this review short, because I don't want to give any spoilers.<br /><br />This is another book that asks the question, how well do you really know someone?  What if the person who sleeps next to you every night has been playing a part?  What are we each capable of when we feel threatened or wronged?<br /><br />Highly recommend.

B005GFPZYK|4.0|Good story of a Navy SEAL sniper. The book focused mostly on his job as a SEAL, but had some good inputs from his wife on their life and how it affected her and their children during his time away from the family. Inputs from his Navy duty could have been a little more detailed on the inside working within the Navy community. Overall a good story and enjoyable book to read..

B003I87O2I|1.0|Let's get something straight off the bat--Mick Jones was always the key writer of FOREIGNER. Lou Gramm is a FANTASTIC, soulful, and STRONG singer. Between the 2 of them, they made 4 GREAT albums if your like me and enjoyed the 'Heavier' songs like 'Cold as Ice', 'Hot Blooded', 'Juke Box Hero', 'Head Games', etc. After the band hit HUGE with 'I Want To Know What Love Is'--it ruined them IMHO. They became 'balladeers' rather than a ROCK group. I had HIGH hopes for this album though after hearing the recently (a few years now) reformed band. Right off the bat I knew singer Kelly Hanson from his old Metal band HURRICANE (with QUIET RIOT guitarist Carlos Cavazo's brother on bass as well as OZZY OSBOURNE bassist Rudy Sarzo's brother on guitar)--and let me tell you--the man ALWAYS had a killer voice! I never realized just how CLOSE it was to Lou Gramm's until hearing him sing early FOREIGNER to perfection! So with him on the mic, and Ex-DOKKEN/DIO bassist Jeff Pilson, I said \\"Hey--this could be HEAVY!\\" NOT. The 'new' FOREIGNER are KILLER live--and HEAVY...BUT the new studio album STINKS. It's all SUPER commercial POP ballad crud. Sappy, old-fogey stuff (before anyone gets offended--I am 45 years old--and STILL like my music LOUD--thank you very much). When I saw all the 4 and 5 star reviews on here I was SHOCKED! Did Mick Jones pay people off--or is everyone from the 70's DEAF now? What made FOREIGNER great was they knew how to ROCK as well as have a ballad or 2 on the album. There are perhaps THREE good songs on the album (the best being the first track 'Can't Slow Down' which is the one most reminiscent of the band of old). Kelly Hanson sounds EXACTLY like Lou Gramm live in concert and ALOT like him on the new album...but it's just an hour of sappy ballads is all. To all disappointed early FOREIGNER fans like me:let's hope 'Ol Mick Jones grows some 'nads back for the next album--he NEEDS to turn his distortion up on his Marshall and WAIL on his Les Paul like he did in the old daze...we need more 'Dirty White Boys', 'Head Games', and 'Double Visions'--not 10 'I Wanna Know What love Is' re-treads--THEN they will get back on the charts! C'mon FOREIGNER! Come back with a VENGEANCE next time! ROCK OUT on your next disc!
B007C3TVEY|3.0|OK, so let's talk.  Critically this film by Lynne Ramsay (director/co-writer) explores the development of a serial killer from birth to adolescence.  From the beginning Eva (a superb Tilda Swinton) wasn't sure she wanted to give up her career as a travel journalist but her husband (John C. Reilly) thinks it's time to start a family.<br /><br />The first born, Kevin (Jasper Newell at 8 and creepy Ezra Miller as a teen) never connected with his Eva.  He seemed to gravitate to Franklin (Reilly) and hate his mother.  Eva's exasperation with Kevin leads to clear psychological trauma.  The film jumps around all over the place with no real place-setters, so about the time we figure out what's what, it's time to jump again.<br /><br />While Swinton and Miller give memorable performances, you have to ask yourself why this movie had to be made.  It is unsettling, disturbing and over-stylized.  As expected, we never get the answer to Eva's question to her son.  Why?  Indeed, why?<br /><br />The Blu ray disc looks excellent with the transfer in the original 2.35:1 aspect ratio.  The color palet is excellent and the detail exemplary.  The sound likewise is very good with a DTS-HD MA 5.1 giving proper treatment of the audio including Jonny Greenwood's dark score.
B007V80WUC|5.0|Thanks in huge part to Amazon.com, I discovered this band. Being a big Dream Theater fan this site suggested I check this Norwegian Progrock outfit out. I'm glad I did! All I can say great disc from start to finish. Tight vocals, tight playing and great songs. Prog fans give these guys a listen, they rock!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I dont know what all of these people are talking about. My game hasent froze at all. I think this game is fun and the ninja looks funny.

I love the characters and the roll they played in this whildly sexy drama story!! i am interested to  know if there is a sequal in the mix or if its already published. please keep me informed!!!

B000002LJA|5.0|Here he pays homage to Jazz and gives a supporting and nurturing nod to hip hop. Sarah Vaughn, Ray Charles and Dizzy are eternal. Beautiful songs.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I'll keep this short and sweet, after Presto I'd lost the faith, I wasn't impressed with it at all. The first Rush album I owned was Exit...Stage Left and for me that was hard to top. I caught back up with the band on Vapor Trails. Ah, yes that's the Rush I remember. Clockwork Angels, you ask? Well, ITS JUST THE BEST DAMN RUSH ALBUM SINCE MOVING PICTURES PERIOD!!! I've been listening to it for the last four days, basically non-stop, all waking hours. Clockwork Angels just summarizes what Rush is all about. I'll probably listen to it for the next month and drive people crazy. All of you naysayers, it is NOT Moving Pictures II, so just move on, for a band to grow they must go in new directions. You may think otherwise, but Clockwork is the best Rush album yet, period.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love love love this book. Grey finally figuring out that he can no longer be without Ana and falling to his knees---> Can I say tear jerker? I found this book to be the best out of the series and this is where things really heated up making it irresitable to finish the trilogy. I read all three books in ONE WEEK!!! Best book trilogy I've read to date. You wont regret buying this novel. Love how the aurthor is able to capture her audience making each seen vivid enough to make you feel like you're actually there. A MUST READ!!
B007XNAQLA|5.0|Having seen RTF live in the 2011 tour I was very interested in the CD. I disagree with the earlier review that this record is a step-down from the 2008 RTF Returns CD/DVD. I actually find the addition of Jean Luc Ponty an excellent one. At various points you have three string instruments playing and it's fascinating trying to determine which one is which. I also think Ponty's Renaissance is a highlight of the record. The DVD is nice not great. I'm really hoping they do a full blu-ray release of their tour.<br /><br />I didn't following RTF for the 1st thirty plus years but this is an excellent testimony to their staying power. Highly, highly recommended.
0062197258|5.0|I just finished this book. It is the most gripping and terrifying novel I have ever read. It is written in an unusual format and is a non-stop reading experience. Hang on and read these amazing words!! Thank you to Karin Slaughter for suggesting Into the Darkest Corner...I enjoyed it immensely!
1416972242|4.0|Without a doubt, the second novel in Cassandra Clare's Mortal Instruments series is just as nerve-wracking as its prequel. With the return of some of my favorite Shadowhunters, I couldn't help smiling as characters fell in love, pondering as new discoveries were made, and gasping at every turn.<br /><br />I've always loved the world Cassie Clare had created. A world of nephilim, vampires, werewolves, faeries, and warlocks-each species being a combination of either angel, demon, or human-fascinates me. And the plot in this book! I was engrossed in this one even more than I was in City of Bones (I think I have a thing with murders in books; they just grab at my attention).<br /><br />Cassie's characters also majorly improved. With this installment in the series, Clary became less of a Mary Sue in my mind. Her newly discovered talent with runes still didn't qualify her as kick-butt, but my opinion of her rose rapidly. And Jace-Jace became even more complex, even more of a character whose emotions dominated him.<br /><br />The romantic tension between Clary and Jace grew even more in this novel-which of course made me pleased. (Totally Team Jace here.) Even though they still had that pesky little hurdle of (spoiler if you haven't read City of Bones) incest, they couldn't help falling in love with each other, no matter how hard they tried to push their feelings away.<br /><br />I adored this book. With even more plot twists and major improvements in character development, this book left me flipping its pages 'til the very end. Readers are going to want to get their hands on City of Glass the very minute-no, the very second-they read the last word in this novel.<br /><br />Source: copy borrowed from library
0345803485|4.0|This is a great book but sad that 30 pages were cut wrong but got through it. Had to guess what the rest of the page. But still a wonderful book ;-)
B0079XPUOW|1.0|This book was mediocre, at best, and would have rated 3 stars if not for one thing.  Product placement.  There are a few too many brand names mentioned in this book.  I was going along reading it, thinking ok, not bad, when the name of a popular chain restaurant popped up.  Not one, but two scenes take place in this restaurant.  After finishing the book, I went back and read all the reviews (and I agree with all of the 1 and 2 stars comments).  I was surprised to see that no one had mentioned the product placement.  It's a definite red flag for me and if I had known about it,  I wouldn't have spent $11.99 on this book.  For $2.99, I wouldn't complain, and have actually read much better books in that price range.  Shame on you, John!
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Describes the reality of one mans war in a very graphic manner.Obviously written by a common man with uncommon skills.
B0010XR2WK|5.0|I find the engaging, emotional rollercoaster presentation of these modern legal challenges to major current societal issues to come from perspectives not commonly addressed. Riddled with human vulnerability, intimacy and intellectural suspense, this show educates on the flexibility and practice of salient points of law in a gripping, sexy format filled with intrigue and incipient risk.  I know I'll never think of a criminal or class action case the same way ever again.  My compliments to the community that created this show! ...
B000VSAEYI|1.0|When i first received this toy i was so excited to pump it up for my 16month old son.<br />Unfortunately , i found out that the pool doesn't  hold the air for long , actually not even for an hour! I was so frustrated. I will look into patching the pool with attached patch kit. So hopefully soap and water will help identify all the holes!<br />This is not a quality product , one chamber for main water area ? it should be at least two , otherwise the entire toy just deflates with one hole :(
B007VT6QSI|4.0|Bieber is stepping musically in the right direction even though I prefer the acoustic album. This album is better than I thought it would be. Bieber is growing up. I wish he would of done a duet with Selena Gomez that would be amazing, maybe in the future. This album to me is meant for everyone. I enjoy this album. I take it for what it is. I feel like people waste time hating on him, he has talent he deserves to be where he is. This album has a good mix on it. I sure believe in him, and I hope you do too. I hope he is around for a really long time. Bieber has the X Factor and eventually he will take over more than he already has. This album is defiantly different from his previous albums. I recommend the deluxe edition for the extra songs. Bieber fever fans will defiantly want this, and his new Girlfriend perfume. He sure has swagger, and no his ego hasn't got the best of him. To me this album is very romantic it's nice. It's nice to fall in love to. ( You get the picture lol ) I think after this album he will gain fans, and may lose some of his younger fans ( sorry just trying to be honest ). Now go by the album believers. My favorite songs on the album are:<br />1. Fall<br />2. Boyfriend ( of course! )<br />3. Believe ( for the believers of course )<br />4. Die in Your Arms<br />5. Be Alright<br />6. Take You
034580404X|4.0|I'm not one to follow the herd when comes to the latest fads; particularly with books.  I refused to read this series for months.<br /><br />However, several of my coworkers -- many of whom I've always considered to be proper (or \\"vanilla\\") were reading them and would blush when they talked about how much they liked them.  So I gave in and burned through the first book in 2 days.  I finished the second book in less than 36 hours and completed the third in 2 days.  I've never read a series that quickly.<br /><br />Pros: It's an absolute page turner!  E.L. James minces no words in her descriptions and does a really great job blending the emotional development as well as the physical relationship between Christian and Anastasia.  It was very difficult to put down.<br /><br />Cons: The ending of the third book was...how shall I phrase it...anticlimactic.  It felt like the author ran out of ideas and ended it with a \\"happily ever after\\".  I really struggled with this.  If you spend three books using the words \\"petulant\\" and \\"mercurial\\" to describe the main character only to end the saga with a perfect life where everyone is even tempered and happy is confusing and quite frankly, irritating.<br /><br />Overall, it reads quickly and is very entertaining.  That's all you should expect out of it.

0345803485|1.0|I decided to purchase this book out of curiosity. Big mistake! Should have listened to the other reviews on here. I know 4th graders who can write a better story than James. It's disgusting that this book has received so much recent attention. Do people not realize it is an erotic novel? And a very poor one at that! There is no interesting story line- just sex, and random details to fill the pages where there's not a sex scene. I should have known better when it became apparent that Twilight fans were the main ones creating a fuss over this novel (if you could call it that). Disappointed...
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Couldn't wait to start this last book in the series and I couldn't put it down. Great ending to a great series!!
B007P6VLRS|5.0|After a few listens, I really love this album. Sometimes people need to learn to relax and not constantly compare new music to old songs you loved from years ago. I use to do that but in reality, once you get use to the new songs, they fit right in. They played lot of these songs in concert last year. I really hope they come back to Vegas this year now that I actually know the new songs.
B007C3TVNA|1.0|In a reckless moment free-spirited Eva has unprotected sex with her spouse/boyfriend/whatever, causing a pregnancy for which she feels increasingly unprepared. Soon enough Kevin emerges from her womb with an inexplicably preternatural awareness of his mother's prenatal reluctance/indifference/whatever towards him and proceeds to make her life hell for much of the film until his sinister grudge culminates in an atrocity.<br /><br />That is the plot in a nutshell, although the film progresses in a non-linear fashion, no doubt in an attempt to unsettle the viewer so that one feels as bewildered as Eva through these events. The atrocity is referred to obliquely at the film's beginning but it's not difficult to figure out what happened from the barrage of speechless images. From there the first thirty minutes are an unnerving slog. However, once Eva throws Kevin against a wall--does anyone ultimately blame her?!--the film takes a bizarrely comic turn. The father becomes impossibly doting and oblivious as Kevin gets noticeably creepier. And in spite of her paranoia--conveyed, I suppose, by Tilda Swinton's relentless blinking at Kevin's foul-mouthed replies to her every solicitation--Eva reacts with equal indulgence.<br /><br />The film's score constantly wavers between the strumming of a mandarin guitar (which is annoying as hell) or haunted house music or (more aggravating still) various uplifting songs which clash spectacularly with the dreary subject matter.<br /><br />Oh, and is John C. Reilly capable of playing anything other than a complete imbecile?

B007J4T2G8|2.0|Having read the Twilight novels, I didn't think I would ever read a worse bestseller. Well, it turns out that I was wrong. Fifty Shades of Grey IS worse, and it almost embarrasses me as a fan of writing. Putting aside the obvious fact that this book is nothing more than an immature woman's Twilight fantasy, and it clearly shows in every chapter, the writing itself is just so terrible. Anastasia is constantly biting her lip, the characters are incredibly unrealistic, and the dialogue makes it seem like the author is stuck in a fourteen year old's daydream. Hell, even the sex found within gives the impression that the author is a pent-up virgin. I used to read fan-fic online years ago, and even though it's been a while, the origins of this book were extremely apparent. Even if I had never known anything about the book, the connections to both the Twilight series, and hilariously bad internet fan-fics, would have come out in full-force by chapter six.<br /><br />The absolute only reason I even gave this two stars is because it can be so bad, that it entertains. How anyone sees this as a romantic novel, or anything more than literary junkfood.. Well, there isn't yet a word invented to describe that level of delusional.
B0086700CM|4.0|I get mad over this game!! i cant stop playing it. I especially love the tasks that you have to complete and the funny commentary when you die :)

B0071XO8RA|5.0|What if mankind slowly disintegrated to the point of destroying itself?<br /><br />What if mankind, in a last-ditch effort, manage to save a portion of itself but only to continue life in a self-enclosed \\"silo\\", packed like so many seeds in a container, some perpetuating themselves, some rotting?<br /><br />What if the \\"rotting\\" seeds were the good seeds, not the bad?<br /><br />This is the story that Hugh Howey creates in \\"Wool\\" - a post-apocalyptic SF story which examines the social aspect of people who are forced to live in close proximity and are micromanaged by their leaders.<br /><br />I'll be honest - the early part of the story was not very inspiring, even \\"wooly\\", if you will, but as I continued to read I realized that Howey had chosen his plotline deliberately, revealing only what his central characters knew.<br /><br />\\"Wool\\" is carefully crafted. It is free of errors (except formatting errors which seem to creep maddingly into all Kindle e-books, even mine!), and as other reviewers here have predicted, it is destined to become a classic in the SF epic field, much as Walter M. Miller's \\"A Canticle for Leibowitz\\" did when it came out of nowhere in 1960.<br /><br />Belay that. It is an SF classic already.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This is a fantastic book from cover to cover. The only problem I have is the ending. The author writes it in such a way that you are either forced to read the second book, or lose interest.

0345803485|1.0|I hate that I even had to give this one star. I purchased this book to see what the hype was about, and after I read it I'm still wondering. I thought it was horrible. On a personal note, if you are a woman that has ever been in an emotionally abusive relationship where the other person is controlling and you feel like you have to walk around him like you are on egg shells I don't believe you will enjoy this book. There is nothing sexy or appealing about a man with those issues.

B0088TG252|3.0|This movie features an excellent cast coupled with an interesting story. I'll watch anything that Denzel does; however, there are very few things more annoying to me than the \\"jumpy camera technique\\" that was popularized by the Blair Witch Project. Seriously, The only thing that I can think of that might be more irritating would be a baby screaming it's lungs out in the theater while this movie was playing. But wait, there's more...the producers of this thing have also added crummy audio-you can't understand what's going on when the characters are speaking quietly...Blair Witch didn't even have that! Save the jumpy camera for fight scenes, auto accidents and plane crashes, not the whole darned movie. To the creators of great movies please, please, I beg you, make movies that we can both see and hear! To the consumer I would say, Safe House is worth renting; however, you should allow plenty of time, because you are going to have to watch it 2 or 3 times to be able to catch everything that's going on.
B005LAIHXQ|1.0|I've been a big fan of the Alien franchise for over 30 years, & can't express my disappointment enough with Prometheus. I can't believe that the creator of the original Alien would screw over the franchise like this. When John Carpenter prequeled The Thing last year, he tied it together to the original perfectly. Ridley Scott surprisingly was as far off base as one can get with his prequel to his original Alien. Gone are the face-huggers which have been the staple of the entire Alien franchise, & now replaced with the kraken, snakes, & a deadly virus!? WTF! Gaping holes are left between this & the original as Prometheus plays out, with the debacle finally concluding with an ending that could not possibly be any worse. The only consolation is the visual perfection that is present in all of Ridley's films.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|If you are concerned about this being a self-published book -- no worries.  The writing is equal to much of what I have read by well-established authors.  One of the joys of reading this book was knowing almost nothing about it.  I had no advance knowledge of the setting which I feel really enhanced the experience of being led into the world by the author.  That's why I say -- stop reading the reviews and just go ahead and get the book already!  I'm referring to the Omnibus edition (you will want it all).

073935650X|4.0|As an adult, I didn't love this book. Of course it is written mainly for a young adult audience, so I don't hold this against it entirely.<br /><br />I can see the necessity of this book. If I were in middle or high school, I would have appreciated and related strongly to the character of Hannah; middle school was not the best time of my life, and the first couple of years of high school weren't wonderful memories either, so thankfully I found my niche as a junior and senior. There were days that I thought of suicide but never got the courage to proceed with it, and was diagnosed with depression in my mid-20s.<br /><br />Having said that, at a younger age I would have empathized greatly with Hannah's character. However, I have to wonder if, even at a younger age, I would have thought of her as self-absorbed, overly sensitive, and... whiny. I know I did as I read this yesterday. But at her age, weren't we almost all self-involved? Psychologists have evaluated adolescents in regards to egocentrism extensively, and when I read this book, that's all I could think about, along with, 'Where are her parents?' Of course we find out about half way through the book what they were up to, but as a parent and the holder of a psychology degree, I couldn't help but spend most of my time mentally evaluating Hannah's character and thinking of solutions to her problems (quit hanging around with people who devalue your worth; find some community work to participate in; quit dwelling on the internal struggles and find the value of yourself outside of your own mind; etc.). I suppose I'm to analytically minded to read these types of stories.<br /><br />Anyway, this book is well written. The style of writing is a breeding ground for confusion, but Asher manages to keep everything organized in a manner that keeps the story flowing and the reading easy.
0439023521|5.0|I have to tell you that I have ALWAYS been a person that has never taken an interest in reading, even in school I was forced to read (and HATED it). I have tried everything to find interest in reading.....My sister's all read and enjoy it and I never have found an area that I was interested in. I saw Twilight and was hooked read all the books and reread them. Then I see the ad to this Movie Hunger Games (and I am thinking are you serious this is so not something I want to see, kids killing kids) but I have to say the movie was amazing and it hooked me. Read this one and the other 2 and LOVED them more then the movie. The book has details that the movie left out and I have to say for the first time in my life, the book was better than the movie. I am reading and could not be happier to share my review, read the books you will not be disappointed. The second book I felt was the best.
B0086700CM|5.0|What a great game!  It is challenging yet fun, so that it doesn't lose you with repetitive game play.  Excellent game!
B005LAIHY0|5.0|This movie ventures into the unknown allowing the viewer to bring up questions that are not intended to be answered. There is no set answer on where the origins of life came from. Fans of the Alien series best not go into the movie with expectations because you will be setting your selves up for disappointment. Ridley Scott did a fantastic job in creating a world that is creepy and at times thought provoking. Too often now films are hell bent on giving the answers to everything when its sometimes better to leave the film up to interpretation. I'm glad Prometheus was a story on its own, rather than being a direct prequel with aliens and face-huggers. The film requires more than one viewing and is best to watch multiple times to get a better understanding of the events that occur. If you go into the film with expectations you will be disappointed and will be cheating yourself to a thrill-ride that we have not seen in a science fiction film for a while. Give it a chance and take it in, you won't regret it.
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|Those of us who are old enough to have seen the original have a different opinion of this movie. This is the better of the two. One aspect of the movie made it that way. It was not the special effects, which were great by the way, but the accompanying soundtrack. The music in the background brought what was happening on the screen to \\"life\\". This was especially true during the final 30 minutes of the movie.<br />  Think they'll make an updated Flash Gordon?

B0087240Z4|2.0|I've seen a huge amount of press talking about how Oceania is the Pumpkins' best work since Mellon Collie, and I agree with that.  But that's simultaneously encouraging and depressing: on the one hand, this is the best thing they've put out in nearly two decades; on the other hand, it's still not very good at all.<br /><br />I've been the hardest-core SP fan since Mellon Collie came out.  Their best work is unforgettable, and Corgan at his height was one of the best songwriters of all time.  But Oceania is representative of his more recent efforts: it's overproduced in a bad way, it's lacking in energy and drive, and--perhaps worst of all--it's completely forgettable.  Corgan's written some of the best riffs in rock music--Cherub Rock, Rocket, Today, Bullet With Butterfly Wings, Zero, 1979--but there's literally not one riff on this album that sticks with me or that motivates me to listen to it again, only louder.  The whole time I was listening to the album, I just kept thinking, \\"Ok, let's wrap this song up so that we can move onto something different and hopefully better.\\"<br /><br />Corgan's always been great at writing long songs.  His longest songs are among his best--Soma, Thru the Eyes of Ruby, Porcelina, The Aeroplane Flies High.  But the longest song on the album--the title track--is awful.  It's like several songs spliced together, and it never develops or moves or does anything.  The best word to describe it is \\"inert.\\"<br /><br />Perhaps the thing I liked most about the Pumpkins sound was the extreme dynamic range.  Remember that part of BWBW where all the loud guitars go away and it's just Billy and some very jangly, clean electrics?  Then he screams at the top of his lungs while the guitars roar?  That's not even the best example in their catalog, but there's nothing even remotely like that here.  There's some quite-then-loud parts, but they all seem forced and inorganic.<br /><br />Then there's all the electronic nonsense.  On Tonight, Tonight, Corgan used real strings to amazing effect.  Here, he's got a cheap synthesizer apparently set to the default factory tone.  It's embarrassing, frankly.  And that's before you even get to the two consecutive songs that sound like they're going to be Baba O'Reilly knock-offs before turning into boring nonsense.<br /><br />This isn't the worst album the Pumpkins have put out--I think that distinction goes to Zeitgeist--but it's not very good, either.  I was so excited when I read that this was a return to form.  But it's not.  It's more of the same mediocre crap they've been putting out for almost twenty years at this point.<br /><br />And now I feel so, so old.<br /><br />Edited to add two things I forgot in the original review:<br /><br />The vocals are almost non-existent.  Corgan's got one of the most distinctive voices in rock music, but it's almost as if he's afraid to use it here.  His vocals are always flat--as a commenter pointed out, there's neither his trademark scream or his falsetto.  It's just the blandest vocals delivering extremely forgettable melodies with this annoying false earnestness.<br /><br />And finally, there are exactly zero memorable guitar solos.  The Pumpkins have always been guitar-oriented rock, but the guitar work here is really sort of lazy.
030758836X|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect, even with the reviews, as I read Flynn's 'Sharp Objects' and while it was fine, it wasn't memorable to me. Well, with this book she's certainly hit the bullseye. I would equate it to be the 'Presumed Innocent' of today, it is that startling, surprising and riveting. Oh, and dark. Wow, what a dark twisted trip is this book. If you like great thrillers, well written and complex, I can't imagine you will find anything this year to beat it.  I did start to suspect one big twist, but that was mostly because the book was so well written and constructed, and the views of events between the main characters so wildly different at times, it was hard not to come to one certain conclusion. But that was only the first of a number of terrific surprises, all of which worked beautifully for me.<br /><br />As for a few of the reviews complaining about the ending... it is brilliant. Horrifying but brilliant and everything in the novel before leads to it, it makes perfect sense. I was reading the final 30 pages at work (it's truly a 'can't put the book down' novel) and a co-worker at one point remarked, 'What on earth are you reading??' as my face apparently was evidencing such horror. Again, brilliant, if upsetting, ending. What a great book!
B0025UHKNS|4.0|If you are a runner looking for a high end sports watch that won't kill your bank account, you should DEFINITELY consider the Garmin Forerunner 405CX.  I took a good 2-3 weeks and researched a new sports watch and after reading TONS of reviews I decided on this excellent watch.<br /><br />If you've been reading the reviews on here I think the biggest gripe people have is with the bezel.  I've come to the conclusion that the people complaining about it have A) not put in enough time playing around with it  B) probably have not read the user manual.<br /><br />When I first got the watch I read the user manual front to back, TWICE.  Then I just started having fun with it.  There is a setting in the watch so you can change the touch sensitivity on the bezel.  Once I raised the sensitivity I easily scrolled through the menu pages.  Basically don't be scared by the bezel, I think it's a really cool function and easy to use once you get comfortable with it.  Oh yeah, you can also lock the bezel by pressing the two sides buttons at the same time.  I've forgotten to lock the bezel a few times but have never had any issues if I didn't lock it.<br /><br />The watch syncs with the GPS/satellites fairly quickly and it automatically detects the heart rate monitor, which is a nice feature.  If you're running outside I would recommend syncing with the satellites while you're stretching and by the time you're done you're all synced up!<br /><br />You can input which data you want to see while running and it will scroll throughout your run (you can choose how fast the data scrolls).  The GPS is very accurate too, so you're always getting the correct mileage.  The watch bases calories burned on your physical information (weight, height, activity level, etc.) so it's not 100% certain whether that info is right but not a huge deal in my opinion.  If you're the type who has to know their cadence then you're going to have to shell out about $40-$50 more for a foot pod which attaches to your shoe.<br /><br />All in all, you are a getting a high quality product which doesn't kill your bank account.  Garmin really knows what they're doing when it comes to sports technology.  Since my computer is so old it won't support the feature where the watch uploads your run info to Garmin's website but I hear it's a great feature that won't disappoint and very easy to use.

0345803485|1.0|Was happy to find so many other baffled readers wondering how this is a runaway best seller. I don't want to be negative since I try to support all creative pursuits, but this book is appalling! I have muscled through the first third, and I don't know if I can continue. The writing is extremely juvenile, redundant and filled with cliches. If this is a best seller, then every harlequin romance novel should be as well. The characters are straight out of one, from their names (a dorky college student named Anastasia Steele??) to their cheesy, overly pontificated dialogue. And sidenote--Anastasia is a journalism student in the year 2011 attending a University in the United States--yet she \\"doesn't have access to the Internet.\\" Really??! These are the types of implausible notions this book will expect you to go along with, to advance the story so that Christian and Ana can have slightly creepy/fully corny sexual encounters. Please, this writer has made enough money already. Buy a book from someone else instead.
0345803507|2.0|This is a hard review to write.  Many things in this book made me put my hand down and decide to give it an extremely low rating; however, I struggled with the fact that--at some sick level--I still enjoyed it.<br /><br />The hardest thing in this book is Ana's inability to actually stand up for herself.  It was distressing when Christian made comments about acting as though she were a child, wanting to take care of her in a paternal capacity, etc.  At several points, Ana felt distressed by this as well, but failed to actually tell Christian \\"no.\\"  When she inadvertently causes one of her bodyguards to be fired, I was incensed that she didn't stand up to Christian.  He continuously talks about trust, yet he fails to give her any.<br /><br />Yes, the sex in the book is extremely steamy, but I have to wonder what kind of relationship they have.  I wonder if it is built on something other than mutual lust.  When Ana is going crazy because they have not had sex in four days, I had to roll my eyes. Further, there are times that the sex is almost outright rape!  When Christian ties Ana to the cross, refuses to let her orgasm, and makes comments like \\"This is what you make me feel,\\" I cannot help feeling sick.  I understand a desire to shake your spouse on occasion, but I cannot comprehend the full desire to punish them and then lose control while doing it.  Her inner monologue, the pleasure he gained from it (not to mention the fact that he never would have stopped), and her use of the big-guns safe-word made my stomach turn.  And, if that isn't enough, she apologized to him!  Dysfunctional is an understatement.<br /><br />However, after that incident, I was pleasantly surprised that Ana finally confronted Christian about his behavior and put her foot down after his reaction to her big news.  He needed to hear that he was acting like a child.  I do wish that she had made it clear that, after he made a big deal about her never leaving, he was quick to run out the door and leave her.  Although I am completely unclear how you could feel a strong sexual attraction to someone after the outburst Christian had.  All of that aside, the whole scene did give a good look into Christian's 50 shades and show how he always dealt with stressful situations: sex.<br /><br />I appreciated that James finally went into some of Christian's past.  The clip at the beginning isn't much; however, paired with the clip about his first Christmas, I felt it gave a very intimate look into his life.  I also appreciated that the audience learns a little more about Elena and his relationship with her.  However, I still agree with Ana, she is nothing more than a sick, twisted pedophile.  And, after rehashing the story for Ana, I like that Christian is finally able to start to see that.<br /><br />The whole story with Jack Hyde was a too cliche.  I'm glad that James decided to try and give the story a little oomph; however, I think she should have given more thought to it.  It seemed way too convenient to have that connection between Jack and Christian and then have Ana start working at SIP on top of all of it.  Also, I wish she would have followed it a little more.  As with the helicopter crash and Lela, James ended it far too soon and wrapped it up too nicely.  I would have liked to see Christian in a little more anguish over the belief that Ana had left him.  She also needed to either get rid of it entirely or play it up Jack's bail a little more.  Honestly, I think I would have been fine with the knowledge that the person who provided Jack's bail was unknown.<br /><br />All in all, I think James was trying to flesh out the story a bit more and give it more depth than just the sex; however, it was basically the same story.  The story was interesting, I wanted to know what would happen, and I definitely loved the sex . . . However, I just left the story feeling unfulfilled.leave her.

B007MC868M|5.0|This is the 9th Harry Hole mystery but only the 7th translated into English. Nesbo is a gifted writer who has maintained excitement throughout the series at the same time we learn more about this fascinating character.<br /><br />After the events of The Snowman and The Leopard, Harry has gone to work as an enforcer in Bangkok. He's been away for three years, and has no wish to return, but his one-true-love Rakel's son, Oleg, has been arrested for the murder of a young drug addict, and Harry is determined to use his experience and instinct to see justice done, even though the case looks hopeless.<br /><br />While the mysteries in each book are excellent, it's Harry who enthrals the reader with his wry perceptions and unerring detection. A used-and-regurgitated tomcat of a man, Harry is nevertheless often the only person who strives for justice, hitting his head against the proverbial wall until, eventually, despite all the corruption and lethargy of the bureaucracy, he manages it. So even though Harry is one of the most weary people you'd ever meet, in the end the books are optimistic. And despite his scars, internal and ex, he possesses a dry, insightful wit that sneaks into his language. He is a man damaged but not down, or maybe down but not out.<br /><br />Nesbo's writing is superb, and I hope the series goes on forever. The narration alternates between a third person perspective of Harry, and the first person reminiscences of the murder victim. Both are well written, compelling, and I can't believe Eastwood or Scorcese hasn't optioned these, frankly, but even when they do, these will be rich, textured books that demand reading. Heck, I'd love to see these as graphic novels. The dialogue and the mastery of perspective astonish, and the stark scenes in Norway would be gorgeous. I thoroughly enjoy this series, and can't wait for the next one.<br /><br />If you like the series, you will enjoy the peeks into Harry's thinking and into renewed relationships with Rakel and Oleg. Disappointingly, we get only only minor appearances by Hole's diminutive army of brilliant, loyal friends. if you are new to the series, don't start here; go to The Redbreast, Harry's third novel, but the first translated to English. If you're in publishing, PLEASE get those first two translated. I'm almost tempted to learn Norwegian, and maybe one day will, just to read the first adventures of HH.<br /><br />Highest recommendation.<br /><br />\\" 'Relax, no one can see us,' Harry said, grabbing one of the spades and setting off. Hans Christian hurried after him, pulled out a torch and clicked it on.<br />  'Now they can see us,' Harry said.<br />  Hans Christian clicked it off.<br />  ....<br />  They both grabbed a screwdriver, knelt down on the coffin and began to loosen the six screws in the lid.<br />  'We won't get the lid off with both of us on top,' Harry said.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved it.  Much more info than the movie. I'm excited about reading the second book.  The movie should be good too with more background informatiom.
B00005N6KG|2.0|I gave my wife an old set of Sony MDR-014 which came with my Walkman and then regretted it years later, so I ordered this stand-alone equivalent.  I LOVED those MDR-014's, and the MDR-W08L's are pretty much the same except they're grey instead of white.  However, when they arrived, there was absolutely no sound coming out of the right headphone no matter how much I wiggled the cord.<br /><br />I give this two stars, not because the left headphone really sounded awesome, but because Amazon refunded my order without requiring me to send it back.  Good for them! They trusted me enough to realize that it wasn't worth the value of this $8.13 defective product to ship it back and dealt with me on the honor system.  Kudos to Amazon for dealing with this reasonably.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Starting out the book grabbed me. I wanted to know what happened just as much as Nick and the police. It kept me interested and then... nothing... just nothing... I feel like I was led on this terrific journey to be shown my garage. I really think the end could have been done better. I flipped back and forth thinking I missed something. Maybe its just because I like things wrapped up that the end bothered me. I would recommend it to be read and maybe someone can tell me if I just didnt get it.. was there an inside joke I missed?
B00884GR0W|5.0|I've only just started playing, but I already like what I see enough to buy the full version. It's similar to Minecraft, yes, but the graphics are MUCH better and the quests make it feel more like a game. I wouldn't mind playing this on the PC!
B00884GR0W|1.0|Refund or no fun comes out of this game! Try getting the.minecraft pocket edition on the kindle!!!!<br />stupid block story wasting my money!!
B001TH15UM|5.0|Excellent product, image quality is very good and very sharp. My only reservation would be about the sound. Modern techniques allow for better recording and/or better editing. All in all, a must have for all Asia fans, they still really got it!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is gasometer I recamend this game if you like Mario bros or any other game so that if you buy it you'll be happy :)
B0086700CM|5.0|love playing it but its not for everyone. been waiting for forever for them to make a kindle version. hooray.. survival run for Ipod is better though. hoping for a kindle version soon.
0385535139|5.0|Finally Grisham manages to become interesting again although not as deep and ferocious as in his old novels. This is the story of 3 lawyers, the first two older not as bright as the 3rd one, a young lawyer trained in the best schools but running away from a monotonous job, who just happens to join the practice of the 2 older ones.<br /><br />As a person who has know at least one older lawyer really good, I appreciated very much the stories of the 2 older lawyers. Their characters are portraited so well, so alive, that even after finishing this interesting book I ended up missing them. The ending was somehow predictable but it was a riot to read through this book. Highly recommended.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Excellent chip. Matched with an asus mobo and two corsair vengeance sticks. Get this chip if you can live without the hyperthreading the i7 has for $100+ more. Very impressed with the onboard graphics. Running 4.2Ghz and stable, gonna try to push it even further once i replace the stock cooler.
B005EVV5GI|5.0|This is newly remastered. Other than the 2nd and 4th still sound somewhat mudded, the sound is bright and detailed. The \\"New Philamornia Orchestra\\" is phenomenal. Under Klemperer, even in his slow tempo the orchestra is still very well-controlled. Low brass section is unbelievably good. I bought this set only for the 7th which has been out-of-print for years. This set brings back this one-of-the-kind \\"snail-like\\" performance with the newly-remastered sound, which I believe is from the new \\"HQCD\\" release from EMI Japan (I have the HQCD version of the 9th and I compared that with the old release, the HQCD version sounds better than the old one and sounds identical from this one).<br />This set absolutely worth $30 and you'll get some of the finest Mahler recordings ever.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Another great book in the Fifty Shades series.  It's hard to believe but this book has pulled me in even more than the other two!
B001KWTBVQ|3.0|I only gave this movie a three star. It was an ok movie. Drew Barrymore's father in the movie remarrys, dies and she is left with a geedy stepmother who turns her into a servant. But alas, all ends well when she meets and marrys prince charming.
B007P6VLRS|5.0|Oceania in my opinion is on par with the likes of Gish, Pisces Iscariot, and Adore. The fiery guitars are back and the synths are a vast improvement from the first two EPs of Teargarden by Kaleidyscope. The synths in particular don't sound all over the place like Owata and blend much better in the production. The beginning snyths on Pinwheels is one of the best and unique crescendos I've ever heard, and I love how it transitions to a low acoustic piece in the middle of the song. Another notable song is The Chimera, which is similar to Rocket in the sense that the guitars have lots of variation. On the 9 minute title track, I wasn't too amazed with the initial moments, but just like Pinwheels, I enjoy how the first part of the song flows into a nice acoustic piece. Mike's consistent low tone drumming concluded the final part of Oceania extremely well. Pale Horse has an odd but well executed drum effect that sounds like something is being sucked up into a vacuum. It shows that The Smashing Pumpkins are progressing artistically by dwelling into more unknown areas of music. The ending song Wildflower creates a nice atmosphere with the violins in there. The final guitar solo on Wildflower reminds me of the guitar tone Godspeed You! Black Emperor used on the song Static. It also has a similar Behold! The Nighmare dynamic. In fact, Oceania has a pretty good balance of high and lows as an album. The guitars of Panopticon to the acoustic of The Celestials is a good demonstration of that in my opinion.<br /><br />From a lyrical standpoint, Billy's words aren't as memorable as Adore or Siamese Dream, and I suppose that's because this album lacks some negative emotions. Thankfully the lyrics aren't cringe worthy to the point of dragging the instrumentation down(although there are questionable words such as, \\"I'm gonna love you 101%\\"). Billy still retains his Zwanish voice, and although it's not as great as his voice in the 90s, it's not as bad as Zeitgeist vocals. Those are just some minor complaints, but overall, this album has given me a refreshing experience for the band and I'm looking forward to future projects.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I listen to this Bible all day long. Love it! I even Bluetooth it into my truck speakers and listen on the road. Can't live without it!
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|its alright, it should have an option to convert coins to cash. that's why I only give it 3 stars.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|After reading so many negative reviews about this product I had become skeptical. I bought it expecting the worst. I was very pleased. This is completely worth it, unless your one of those whiny hardcore original trilogy fans who can't handle the minor changes. Star Wars is a great story that has 3 generations of fans. (The Original Trilogy, The Prequel Trilogy, and the Clone Wars)<br /><br />Picture and Audio was near perfect, especially in 2 & 3 which were shot in HD.The changes are minor except for the \\"NOOOOOOOOOO\\" which is kinda annoying. The only other change I do not like is the change Call that Obi-Wan does. Aside from that and the first 2 bonus discs being kinda skimpy, it is a excellent collection. As for the people who have given it bad reviews bc of the changes, if you don't like te changes then don't buy the product. If you like the originals then keep the originals. The best change to the films is the new CG Yoda in Episode 1.<br /><br />I LOVE this collection as I am a huge fan of film and love te story of Star Wars. This collection appeals more to a newer generation of fans as ell as the older that are not cry babies.
0345803485|1.0|I read the \\"Twilight\\" series so I could discuss it with my teenaged niece.  I thought it was horribly written with a bad message for teens.  \\"Fifty Shades of Nausea\\" is worse, much worse, disturbingly worse, although its audience is supposedly older and maybe more resistant to such crap!  It isn't sexy; what's titillating about blushing, smirking, gasping, gray eyes in all their infinite variety, inner goddesses, implausible situations and characters?  Others have documented far better than I can, the ridiculous writing in this book.<br /><br />I also didn't like the idea of going into a relationship planning on changing the other person; how arrogant is that?  I didn't like Bella, and I don't like Ana, especially as main characters in books written by women.  How naive do you have to be to expect your first crush to last forever?  Both girls refuse to give up on their creepy, stalker boyfriends.  Most girls with reasonable self-esteem move on to a more (hopefully) mature, satisfying, and HEALTHY relationship.  By healthy, I mean both partners are equal partners and have shared values, including their sexual style--whatever that might be.  As long as you aren't hurting an unwilling partner, I don't care what you do in your bedroom.<br /><br />Poor writing, poor editing, annoying and cardboard characters, and unsexy sex scenes doom this book to failure.  Don't be fooled by the hype; this book will make you mad at yourself for reading it!
B003TJR2HS|1.0|It recognized the camera kit - the very first day, then the next day - it didn't. Never did after.  not sure why so I returned it.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|I downloaded this game, just to see what it was about. And I was impressed. It was very fun and I enjoyed the game. Controls were very well done. Button placement was good. And graphics were really good too. Great game.
1612130283|1.0|I was very excited when I heard of the Fifty Shades trilogy. Finally another good series to add to the book pile, right? WRONG. I finished the book today and thinking back over its agonizingly mediocre pages I keep thinking, \\"How in the world did this book get so hyped up???\\" I honestly cannot understand the popularity. Is it the sex? The cheesy ripoff of Twilight themes? The great cover-art?<br />My biggest issue is with the characters. They are completely unrelatable and one dimensional. And their similarities to Twilight characters make me want to scream. Be original.<br />My second issue is with its length. The book is 500+ pages, but only about 100 or so are relevant. The other 400 are about character Ana's feelings about Christian. The same feelings over and over and over. We get it!<br />Probably the most annoying thing about the novel was when Ana envisioned her \\"subconscious\\" and \\"inner goddess\\". Those that have read the book will know what I mean. Every other page we have to hear about the same metaphorical analogy to illustrate a point that the reader has already deduced.<br />In conclusion, save your money. Fifty Shades is an over hyped and over sexed attempt of a novel that ultimately fails to entertain.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like this app. The overall look and feel of the app is great. Itworks really well on the kindle fire. Must have.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This game is so fun and if you r reading this you need it! Don't get the payd version. It sometimes doesn't work. :)
B007V2UGPE|5.0|awesome. and free app for the kindle. fire. could not be more happy with my purchase good work worth the price
B0086700CM|5.0|awesome!!!!! so addictive!!<br />Temple run is so cool I haven't had any problems with app yet!! Its so much fun
B005BDZQKU|3.0|Deal of the day item nicely done I'm glad I didn't pay more than $25.00 for it . Not really a book that comes with it more like informational flash card for adults. All aside a huge movie fan would appreciate the gift enjoy.
B0086700CM|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME. its awsome....trust me get this game. you wont regret it. you will play this forever.the point of the game is trying to get a many coins as you can. once you get enough coins you can go to the store and get FREE things with your coins.you can get upgrades and new people and wall papers. its really fun!!!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love this alarm!  I use it on my kindle fire.  This alarm is customizable even to small details like how long the snooze alarm lasts, hoe many snoozes to allow, etc.  each time you program an alarm it is added to an easy-to-read checklist.  As my schedule varies from day to day, I really appreciate being able to select the event I need an alarm for.  I use it for everything from getting up in the morning to having my son out on his shoes for school.  I have one &quot;floating&quot; alarm for naps or whatever.  it is very easy to make changes ti alarms.  I also live the stopwatch feature.<br /><br />I read some complaints about volume and battery life on the fire, but have not experienced either problem.  The one thing that took a little getting used to is that when the alarm goes off, you first have to turn on the fire and then go to the alarm app.  I click the button directly from the alarm app so it returns there immediately, and I have gotten very adept at pressing the turn - on button and then snooze in very quick succession.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game even my 4 year old sister a pro at and uses my mom whole battery for that game don't worry what the other hatters say just because they stink at it and its free on the kindle fire
0060755598|3.0|This book contains terrific suggestions on automating your business.  However, the author fancies himself a mastercrafter of words and creative fiction.  Would have preferred that he just got to the point.  In fact, each of the E-Myth books could have been easily summarized in a powerful magazine article of 3,000 words.  Instead, the material is just stretched out to 200 plus pages.  Despite this, the ideas are powerful and certainly worth a read.
B00785P2QC|5.0|It really helps you figure out what a lot of real people have to deal with in the world and it also is a lot of fun. You can really learn a lot. It's awesome.
0307341550|4.0|When thirty-something Camille Preaker, a fledgling reporter for a second-tier Chicago newspaper, has to spend a night at a motel just outside her hometown of Wind Gap, in the boot heel of Missouri, to gather herself before seeing her family after being away for eight years, the reader is being warned that all is not well in her past. She is there because her crusty, old-guy editor thinks that the disappearance of a little girl, the second time that has happened in a year, might be a story that the big newspapers will bypass.<br /><br />To say that Camille has issues with her regal, dominating mother, who also is the absentee owner of the largest employer in the area, is an understatement. Her mother doted on a younger sister who died from an illness nearly twenty years earlier, and now her much younger, junior-high sister Amma is the recipient of her mother's smothering love. But Amma has a totally different side away from her mother; she uses her precocious physical development and sharp mind to control her classmates, often inflicting cruelties on them as the price to pay for belonging.<br /><br />The simple reporting job quickly turns disturbing. Both girls have been murdered and the local police are clueless. An investigator from Kansas City clearly is attracted to Camille but is leery of her at the same time. But most distressing to Camille is her re-immersion into the social scene that she left many years ago. She has to learn the new social dynamics, while recognizing that she will be looked upon as she was before, in some cases her reputation has to be lived down. Between dealing with her dysfunctional family, the cattiness and hostilities of the town folk, and her own personal demons, Camille's mental stability becomes increasingly shaky.<br /><br />The troubled Camille is an interesting, sympathetically portrayed character. Her neediness and her family's and the lengths they go to find love and relief of pain are off the charts. The mystery of the deaths of the girls - actully the entire plot - becomes almost secondary to the psychological deficiencies exhibited. In some ways the story is a little ragged, but consistent with the fragile, erratic mental states of some of the characters.f the girls - actully the entire plot - becomes almost secondary to the psychological deficiencies exhibited.

0439023521|5.0|I absolutly loved reading this book! Very well written story. I actually read it in one day as I could not put it down. And Im not one for reading books all the time. Cant wait to begin part two...Order from Amazon was very quick...Love Amazon!!!!!!
B007MJKOY4|1.0|This movie was about as dull as cinematography can get.  The tension was so thick you could cut it without a knife.  The plot was simple, drawn out and painfully slow to develop.  And the end.....so predictable!  It was incredibly soporific and I am not sure I saw the whole thing. Could be it was a bad dream as I could hardly keep my eyes open
0345803485|1.0|I was do disappointed! With ask the hype generated from this book I was completely disappointed.do real women really have so little self respect?
0525425764|5.0|I was thrilled to receive this book as described. This is the best one of the series yet. Look forward to the next one in the series.
B007IE4DTU|5.0|I purchased this complete set of George Harrison Living In The Material World because I wanted to have everything that was released for this film.  I did buy the original hard back book Living In The Material World which is fabulous, but I wish that version of the book had been released in this set rather than the shortened version.<br /><br />Almost two thirds of the film is about George when he was in the Beatles and the rest of the film is about him after the Beatles.  Its too bad they didn't cover his life and solo career in as much detail as they did when he was a Beatle.  It is almost like he did the All Things Must Pass LP and The Concert For Bengla Desh (concert/film/LP) then didn't do much after that.  He toured the United States in 1974 and toured Japan in 1991 which they didn't cover very much.  They didn't cover most of the records he released through out his life, but they did cover when he was in the Traveling Wilburys.  One of the coolest things in the film was seeing when George and Paul signed paperwork ending the Beatles.<br /><br />Yes, there was so much of his life from 1961 through 1970, but it would have been nice to see, hear and know what he did for the rest of his 30 years of life.  It would have been nice to have the complete hard back book in this set as well as more music on the CD, but they had to delay the release here in the US because HBO had the rights to show the movie before it was released so to put the hard back book in it would have been like buying the same thing again.  This set was released immediately in England and through out parts of the world when it was on HBO in the US, but we had to wait for 6 months to get this release.<br /><br />I have heard there are plans to release more unreleased music in the future which will be nice since the re-issued CD's didn't have much extra on them.  I guess artists and record companies feel we, the consumer, don't want extra tracks (demos or unreleased) are getting a good deal by giving us an extra song (single) or 2 (b-side) when a CD is re-released, but it will be nice to finally get some great demos and alternate mixes.<br /><br />I must say the one thing I never thought about seeing in this movie.  A picture was shown of at a press conference George held in Beverly Hills and low and behold I am right there in the middle of the picture.  I must say that makes the entire movie for me.<br /><br />Anyway, this movie is a must have for any Beatle or George Harrison fan, but maybe just by the hard back book, the movie and the CD is all you need to purchase so you don't have to spend so much money to have everything.g us an extra song (single) or 2 (b-side) when a CD is re-released, but it will be nice to finally get some great demos and alternate mixes.<br /><br />I must say the one thing I never thought about seeing in this movie.

B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I have been wanting to read this series for a very long time. I was very excited when we picked it for our group read and I have yet to be disappointed. This is fast becoming one of my favorite series of all time. I was worried because of some of the comments I had heard, but it is wonderful.<br /><br />Clary Fray is a typical teenager. She doesn't feel like she belongs anywhere and lives in her own head. She spends all of her time with her best friend Simon and lives with her mom. She was always told that her dad was killed in a car accident before she was born. The only father figure she knows is her mom's best friend Luke, who has been there almost all of her life. One night while out with Simon at a local club, she witnesses something beyond her imagination. Thinking that she is helping a boy from being beaten up by thugs, she stumbles across the Shadowhunters confronting a demon. As they look at her in disbelief, they wonder how she can see them. Clary thinks she is going crazy. How can this be possible? Demons? Shadowhunters? These things can't be real. Her mom and Luke start acting strange too. After a fight with her mom, she storms out with Simon. Sitting at the coffee shop with Simon, she sees one of the boys from last night. She ends up following him outside when her phone rings. Its her mom and she tells her not to come home. Clary can hear the terror in her voice, and then the phone goes dead. She rushes home, having no clue of the truths she will learn or that her world is about to change drastically.<br /><br />I love this book. It was non-stop action from beginning to end. The books are a little longer than I realized, but it didn't seem to phase me. I couldn't put it down. The relationship that grows between Clary and Jace is one of the best loves that I have read in awhile. It is beautiful and yet so tragic. The revelation that comes toward the end of the book will upset you. I was pretty angry with the author, but am keeping hope alive. Clary is a pretty good female character. She is strong and unafraid, but a little dense at times. Simon is her dorky best friend who also happens to be in love with her. It adds a twist to the story. Jace is a fabulous yet tortured creature. You will fall in love with his smart-ass attitude and his tender moments of vulnerability. Alec and Isabelle are great supporting roles and the story wouldn't be the same without them. Any fan of YA fantasy needs to read this series.pretty good female character.

B007T2XC7A|5.0|This is one of Norah Jones' best albums (although all her albums are great)!!  Product is exactly what I had in mind when I purchased it.  Looking forward to more of her work.
0743243153|5.0|This is one of the key books that started my conscious growth process as a young adult. I read it when I was 19 at just the right moment, and it served as one of the entry points into the genre of self-help and spirituality literature, which as a whole has had a profoundly positive affect on my life. Great book. I can't recommend it more highly.

1469984202|5.0|The first few pages of Wool left something to be desired, to the point where I almost stopped reading the sample. I'm very glad I didn't. This author has the potential to be one of the very best ever, and I've been reading science fiction for more than 50 years. There is no hype in this work, no attempt to create shallow excitement, no yanking the reader around. There is even limited science. Instead, the author develops the characters and builds his masterful story in a relentless, yet effortless fashion. \\"Wow\\", and its been a long time since I've said that.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|this book is simply fantastic. i read an earlier review complaining about it and i would just like to say... read it if you like that sorta thing not because everyone else likes it. i have read every book so far and i love everything about it. i a. seriously addicted<br /><br />overlook the idea of kids killing kids its not all that. there is also love, hate, and everything inbetween! the only way to expierencethe book is to read it unbiasedly

030758836X|5.0|Oh my gosh - this book was so good. I was drawn in right from the title which is perfect for this book. \\"Gone Girl\\" just sounds creepy and intriguing. This is one of those books that is really hard to review without spoiling it but I shall try. Gillian Flynn has created two fabulous characters in Nick and Amy. While the plot of this book is primarily the mystery of what happened to Amy, it's also a study of Nick and Amy's marriage and how things change once they both lose their jobs and move from New York City to Missouri. I had the pleasure of seeing Gillian speak at an event hosted by Rainy Day Bookstore. She said Gone Girl is about how no one really knows what goes on in a marriage and what happens when your golden lifestyle that you define yourself by is stripped away.<br /><br />My full recap of Gillian Flynn's talk will be published on 6/20/12 at [...]
B006671NPM|5.0|First a confession: I used to be a muggle until very recently. I never read the books and I watched \\"Harry Potter\\" movies for the first time in April and May this year at the express invitation (order) of my daughter. And since the first movie I watched I was immediately captured by the magic of those stories and I saw the last movie in the saga the first day it opened in cinemas.<br /><br />Considering that the movie is still playing, I will try not to provide spoilers, but let me just say, that this film really ends the whole \\"Harry Potter\\" saga with great skill, power and brilliance. I am certain that the scenario had to cut some excellent things which were present in the book, but still, the final chapter is a VERY powerful story!<br /><br />All the main actors perform brilliantly. Daniel Radcliffe has a real talent and in this movie it shows. Emma Watson and Rupert Grint are as good - and I see a great future in the movies especially for Ms Watson. Allan Rickman's Professor Snape is simply impressive and Helena Bonham-Carter's Bellatrix Lestrange is as crazy as usual. Ralph Fiennes plays Voldemort as being even more fiendish than in previous parts - and the Dark Lord also displays personnel management style clearly inspired by Darth Vader... I must say that the delight with which Voldemort screams his \\"Avada Kedavra\\" curse every time in this movie made me really shiver...<br /><br />The thing which I liked particularly is that some of the secondary characters rise to their best. It is of course the case for Neville Longbottom, who finds his internal hero and for Luna Lovegood, who is my absolutely favourite character since the first moment she appeared in the story. But the character who suddenly deploys the wings to rise to her real greatness is Professor Minerva McGonagall! This is without any doubt her greatest hour and she reveals herself to be not only a great witch but also a great general!<br /><br />An excellent idea was to plunge the movie mostly into darkest night and gray shadows. Even when the sun rises, it is obscured not only by thick dark clouds but also by something else, like ashes of a burning world mixed with tears of grief... The atmosphere for this last battle for the future of the world is quite apocalyptic. The battle scenes are very impressive and the siege of Hogwarts seems to be fought as intensely as that of Minas Tirith in \\"Lord of the Rings\\".<br /><br />The ending of the movie is very good and closes with necessary dignity this incredible saga. I recommend to everybody to see this film, even if you are not that much into \\"Harry Potter\\". After seeing this last chapter of the saga I abjured once again and for always my previous muggleness and I will now read the books which my daughter will (I hope) lend me...darkest night and gray shadows.

B005LZYL3G|5.0|This documentary is a must-have for any Pearl Jam fan. Lots of insight into the dynamics of the band throughout their 20 years together. Personal glimpses into how band members felt regarding different events and turmoil.  Even some friends that are not necessarily die hard Pearl Jam fans were captivated by the movie.  Excellent directing and editing, out of this world music, and a story that made me laugh, cry, and ponder the meaning of it all. Loved it!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|At first I only had 1 Android device Droid Incredible. My kids and I all played this game on that device and fought over turns.  I liked how it kept progress for multiple players.  Many games do not offer this capability .  Now it is installed on many other devices in the household  touch pad CM9, Rezound, and Acer A100 it runs great on all of them no freezing.  Yes on the phones the graphics look better and could be improved for HD devices, but it is a very fun and addictive game and come on people it is usually less then $2
B0088O11NU|1.0|Hello i didnt really like it cause its hard they should add more time cause its really hard and also to start it has to be parallel to the floor and thats hard to do.<br />I didnt really like it because of those things but the rest of it is great i think its a nice idea but extremely hard to do<br />thanks for reading
1451626657|5.0|I don't normally laugh when reading books, let alone out loud, but this book is the funniest book I'll probably ever read. Similar, in my opinion, to Kurt Vonnegut's humor, it is a must read for those looking for a hilarious compelling read with characters who are constantly faced with death and the question of sanity. 5 stars!
034580404X|3.0|I enjoyed this trilogy. But the negative reviewers are right about the repetitiveness. I kept looking back because I thought I was rereading the same page. Glorified Harlequin yes. Childish main character's, yes. Contrived dialogue, yes. But it was a fun read. That's why I gave 3 stars.
B0086700CM|5.0|i have been waiting for this for forever! and now its here!it kinda sad to addmit but playing this is prety mutch all iv been doing lately.
0439023521|5.0|Really enjoyed this.  Couldn't put it down.  It was refreshing and a totally different read than I'm used to.  Enjoyed it very much.  Recommended for all ages.
B005DF2QMC|1.0|I received my dbtech Tape Converter.  I have a lot of cassettes that my father made that I wanted to convert for my kids to enjoy.  However, the instructions are obviously written by a Chinese person with English as a second language, and the font is lke a 2!!  so small, even with glasses I had trouble reading it.  I downloaded Audacity, started recording the first tape.  Thought I had saved it in my itunes file and went on to the next.  After I tried to export that one, I realized that the first one didn't save, and now I can't save the second tape.  Can someone tell me how to save it to mp3?  I have Windows 7.<br />Probably would have bought a fancier and more expensive unit had I known how hard this one is to use. May still have to.
B005ZUR724|5.0|Seen some bad reviews but decided to try since it went on sale. Awesome game so far and sorry I didn't try it sooner.
B007VTVGFQ|4.0|I first heard of Fiona apple back in 2005 when her album Extraordinary Machine came out, I was simply amazed by her style of music and for the past 7 year i have been eagerly looking forward to her next album to be released.<br />Why it is that all the greatest artist's in the music industry take 5 or more years to release their albums i'll never understand, but if they come out sounding as great as Fiona's new album then i guess it's worth the wait, Fiona's style hasn't changed a bit and is still just as inventive as her first album was.<br />With the Deluxe edition you get an art book with lyric's and other notes, plus a DVD of live performances, two art cards, and a poster of the album art.<br />The packaging of the deluxe edition is somewhat of a disappointment, my discs were scratched as they were removed from the paper sleeves for the first time, and the overall quality of the Book itself is not that great. Due to the scratching issue, i would only recommend this deluxe edition for the DVD.<br /><br />Fiona's music - 5 stars<br />packaging - 3 stars<br /><br />I have uploaded some pictures of the deluxe edition, enjoy.
1936608898|5.0|This is my first Amazon review but I just had to let people know how much I learned from this book! I've been following grain-free & legume-free diet for about 2 years now without really knowing \\"WHY\\"...other than those food groups really seem to hurt my stomach. Melissa and Dallas is amazing at explaining (instead of nagging), teaching (instead of shoving down your throat), and educating (instead of setting dogmatic rules) about the most natural framework to approach eating and enjoying food.  I'm starting Whole30 today and I can't wait for the amazing journey the next 30 days will bring!
B00785P2QC|4.0|It keeps  me pretty entertianed most of the time so I do not get bored a lot. So that is it.

B0086700CM|5.0|in my opinion temple run is an awesome fun and it gets  challenging. I decided to download this game on my kindle fire because all my friends have temple run on their ipods and I have watch them play it before and I have played it before to and it was fun. I been waiting for a kindle fire addition to be added so I could get it. this game can be for all ages basically.
B007XNAQLA|4.0|I remember a couple years ago when the band Return to forever got back together and reunited to tour. I saw their first concert in Austin Texas. It was quite memorable seeing original players doing songs were that were in my mind the best jazz fusion that you could ever hear. I had learned about this new three CD set, which included jazz greats like Frank Gambale and Jean Luc Ponty. A soon as I got it I ripped it open and started listening to it. As always it's a very good recorded live CD. But I guess I was expecting a little bit more. These great jazz giants that I've been following for some 25 years, have seemed to slow down a little bit. That's why I had said that the mothership has slowed down. I give every praise and respect to all these musicians. Matter-of-fact when I saw them in Austin Texas, I the great opportunity of talking to the band, even before they started. And of course my favorite, being a bass player of 35 years, talking to Stanley Clarke. The concert in Austin, was most spectacular and historic for these four giant musicians coming together again. In the new CD the only person I really hear that's doing some interesting stuff, is Lenny White, the drummer. I'm not knocking the CD but, I guess I'm a little disappointed, saying this spectacular moment of this band reuniting into a fantastic tour. Most of the Return to Forever songs are done quite slower and it seems like they wanted to stretch out each tune for assorted solos. There are two tunes on the CD that were written by Jean Luc Ponty. These were very tastefully done. It seems now for like 10 or 15 years, every time a new RTF album came out, I would gather my jazz friends and have dinner and drink wine and listen to the new CD that came out. We did the same thing when we got our copy on the 19th from Amazon. Three of my jazz professors and two highly acclaimed jazz musicians of my city called this new CD \\"smooth jazz\\". I argued with them, stating that this band had jumped over milestones ofjazz progressions and attained pure jazz fusion. Another one of my jazz professors had stated\\"like everyone, they're getting old.\\" I argued over an hour telling him about this great band that possesses great energy at all ages. So do I think it's a good CD? Yes it's very good. But don't compare it to the live album they made on their last tour. It is a little slower, but I think it's like wine, it's aged quite well. It's really nice comes in a three CD set, two of the CDs are music and one other CD is a DVD which shows about the the tour. For all you RTF fans buy it for the collection, it's very good.
B007SGM084|4.0|I bought this item because the ladies where I workout thought it was a fun summer read.  Of course it was all about kinky sex.  In all honesty, I loved the book.  The characters were well defined, the suspense and intrigue, the climax of the story was exhilarating!  I especially enjoyed the scandal, and story of a child who went from horrible environment to acclaim through education, risk taking and being driven.  A must read for anyone who wants a little sex with their mystery!!!  Ok ok alot of sex!!!!!!
B000VSAEYI|5.0|We bought this for our son's two year old \\"under the sea\\"-themed birthday party this weekend. Since the weather has been great we already set it up before (also to make sure that there are no leaks!) and it is so much fun! We got a little electrical pump and it blows up in no time! I actually blow each piece by mouth, again, which helps to make it a little firmer. This way we get the palm tree to stand up and the slide to not give in!<br />We also used the sprinkler and the second time- there was still a little water in there from the previous day- it came out hot! Just pay attention to it!<br />It really is a great pool- big enough for many kids, cute to look at and even comes with three blow up toys! A great value, too! Especially with the free shipping! We ordered ours on Sunday afternoon and on Tuesday it was delivered!
0345803485|5.0|This is an amazing book. Yes there is sex in the book that intrigues people to read it, BUT there is a love story behind it. Its suspenseful, funny, and sexy. You need to read the 2nd and 3rd book as well. This story will stay with me forever.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|energy needs to cost less cash but the game is fun. but yea I think this is 5***** rating and it needs to lower cash prices.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I ordered the Sonic Screwdriver a few days ago, and it just came in the mail today. I must say, I am quite impressed with the toy overall, it looks great and seems quite durable, as long as you keep in mind this is a plastic electronic device. I doubt it would survive a fall from the Empire State Building like the one in the show did.<br />I think it would be useful to list both the pros and cons that I have observed so far(granted I've only had it for about an hour.)<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. It is a great replica of the screwdriver used by the Tenth Doctor in the show, perfect if your a cos-player.<br />2. It is reasonably hardy - although if you want to purchase this for a younger child or someone who is known to be rough with their toys it may not be the best choice.<br />3. The functions(light, sound, extending and retracting) work great.<br />4. While it is light-weight due to being plastic, it feels good when held in either hand - like it should feel.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. The battery installation can be a pain if you don't have a large enough collection of small Phillips-head screwdrivers. (I used one of the smaller screwdrivers on my swiss army knife)<br />2. It uses three AG13/LR44/L1154 batteries(aka watch batteries), which can be quite expensive. Fortunately it does include three.<br />3. While the sound is quite good, and very authentic, I honestly wish it were a little louder.<br />4. When it lights up, the light is purple instead of blue - not a huge issue, but still something I found to be a bit irksome. This is caused by the actual light being a UV light to go with the UV ink in the pen.<br /><br />I haven't actually played with the pen portion of the screwdriver yet, so I don't have anything to say in that area.<br />Overall I would have to say that this is a great prop and a must-have for any Doctor Who fan. It is definitely worth the price.
B006UIUJ2A|1.0|I picked up this book in the hopes that it would shed more light for me on what life is like in North Korea.  I had already been deeply moved by Blaine Harden's book on North Korea, Escape from Camp 14, and wanted to find in this novel something of the same caliber, at least. I was disappointed to find this book full of unnecessary obscene details such as sexual fantasies, twisted thoughts, and in some parts psychopath-like mentality that reflect the author's own disturbing imagination, rather than the hard reality of life in North Korea. I found the author's embellishments and details tedious rather than insightful.  It lacks the simple facts and details that other books have i.e., \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" by Victor Frankl.  With its graphic and unnecessary details that take too far whatever research the author made, this book is essentially rubbish.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|It had all the things I love.  Wolves, magic, battle, intrigue, detailed world, moral conflict, a likable hero, and strong secondary characters.  It wasn't Tolkien but I still had a hard time putting it down.  I wanted more.

B0080SZ0V8|4.0|Keep them coming Big Fish! The kids have loved your games for the PC and are happy to see them appearing for the Kindle Fire.  Game seems to work well on the Fire. This was one of the first PC games we purchased from Big Fish, so we were familiar with the need to use items in combination, scenes don't have the long list of hidden items like in some of the other games, does have lots of mini games between scenes.
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|A little sad that this is the last of the Millennium Trilogy....very intriguing and at some spots was hard to turn off the kindle! The Swedish names can become a little laborious to read and found myself just skimming over them and moving on. I highly recommend these for anyone who likes a good adventure/mystery/drama !
B001SC9G5O|4.0|I've enjoyed this book but I often find myself backing up a page or two to recapture the line of thought.  English is this authors second language and it shows.  The theories within are interesting and thought provoking, but the book is sort of all over the place and doesn't quiet flow.  Either that, or its above my intellectual capability.  Either way, I'd recommend it.
0307594165|5.0|TONI MORRISON IS MY FAVE AUTHOR OF FICTION!  SINCE THE 1970S, I HAVE READ HER ENTIRE CATALOG, INCLUDINGD HER NON-FICTION ESSAYS.  AS A FICTION & PROSE WRITER MYSELF, I ADMIT THAT MY VOICE HAS BEEN HIGHLY INFLUENCED BY HERS. AS A RESULT, I CANNOT ESCAPE MY HOPE & GOAL OF ACCOMPLISHING THE SAME STATURE IN LITERATURE AS SHE HAS.

HER LYRICAL VOICE MAKES READING HER STORY A REAL TREAT & A BLESSING TO THE FICTION LOVER!
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|I first read Something Borrowed when I saw previews for the movie, and I imagine many others hated Darcey as much as I did. Her actions and attitude with Rachel reminded me all too well of a \\"best friend\\" I had growing up, a friendship I had managed to get out of a year earlier. But I decided to read Something Blue and as Darcey changed as a person, my view of her did a 180 also. I loved this book so much more than the first. It's a beautiful story of redemption and getting a fresh start and finding new love where you'd least expect it (or in Darcey's case, 3 new, unexpected loves). I laughed and I cried. The ending tied the entire story (from both Rachel and Darcey's sides) up in a pretty little bow.
030758836X|5.0|This is a great read with amazing plot twists and turns.  I read too far into the night as I just wanted to go a little further to see what was next.<br /><br />It starts as a common plot...a husband gets a call at work from a neighbor, telling him his front door is wide open and his cat (indoor only, declawed) is sitting on the front porch.  Rushing home, the husband discovers that there is broken glass and overturned furniture in the living room and the ironing board is set up with the iron still on.  His wife is gone.<br /><br />He calls the police and right when you think you know where this book is going, Nick tells the reader that what he just told the police is the fifth lie he has told them!  Wait!!!...what?<br /><br />So now you know all is not as it seems.<br /><br />Chapters alternate between Nick's telling of this spiraling down story (really, could he look any more guilty?) and his wife Amy's diary entries over the past few years.<br /><br />Nick claims he is being framed but the reader already knows he is a liar and will soon find out he is a cheater, too. He acts inappropriately at the search site and when a plea is made live on TV to help find his wife, he reacts to the pressure with a smile that everyone interprets as guilt.  Then he hires a big time lawyer who is known for getting murdering husbands off.<br /><br />Because the writing is tight and clever, you never know if something that happens is just \\"background\\" or a clue.  For example, it is Nick and Amy's fifth wedding anniversary...part of the reason for what is going on?  Or coincidence?<br /><br />You won't be disappointed in this book and you won't guess the ending.  Great book not to be missed!

Good, basic moves that my previous personal trainer had already recommended. sounds like I'm in for a treat with level 2 :P I'm 5'6 and 220 pounds and with the right weights this is just enough to feel it, but not so much that I want to die or quit.

0307594165|5.0|To me, Toni Morrison is the most important American author of the century. Her books changed my life, and they changed the national discourse on race relations. That doesn't mean she hasn't had a clunker or two in her repertoire, but no matter what, she has something fascinating and illuminating to say about race, the past and the awful, tragic legacy of slavery that still, to this day, lingers heavily over many Americans.<br /><br />\\"Home\\" is short, simple and sweet. It's less than 200 pages and every word counts. If you are a Morrison fan, you will devour and treasure every single word she writes. The story revolves around a Korean war veteran, and Morrison does an excellent job of relaying the burden of war that every man and woman who gets sent to the battlegrounds shoulders. It's heartbreaking, especially with recent events in Iraq. Morrison makes you feel the torment that Frank feels every day, thanks to war. Frank is newly returned from Korea and while grasping with his inner demons, he receives a note that his troubled sister is in danger. He must return to the home that he despised to save her, and himself.<br /><br />I thought the book was beautiful in every way and while it's not as dense or complex as \\"Beloved,\\" it packs a strong punch and will make you think.

B007K3JFUQ|5.0|Anyone who rated this movie lower than 5 stars was reviewing the additional ultraviolet digital copy; which is included in the movie package.  Apples and oranges.  The movie is superb.  Excellent acting, directing and cinematography.  Any complaints about the digital copy should be reviewed separate from the movie.
030758836X|3.0|This book held my attention more often than not.  There were parts that dragged on (i.e. any scene in the abandoned mall, the constant referral to the economically depressed area all throughout Part I) but the character twists made up for that.  I did like Amy's character quite a lot although it seemed like some aspects of her personality were explored to no end and some parts were scratched and left dangling.  Which leads me to the ending; it was horrible.  I don't mind \\"and life went on\\" type endings but this was like riding on a bicycle down a huge hill and just petering out to a gradual stop.  Yes there was one more plot twist at the end but it didn't do much to the story line.  I was expecting more.  On the surface it seemed like something profoundly psychological and gripping but in reality it was trite.  Writing that requires that much flat-out explanation for why the characters were doing what they were doing seems amateurish.  Let the reader make of the characters what they want.  Overall it was a decent read with some good \\"gotcha\\" hooks throughout, but it was a bit flat in the end.  I would not read any of her other books based on this one.
B004GYY714|2.0|ok this is not a good app for a kindle fire! loads a lot and does not had very good sound quality. it would be fine if you had earphones pluges into it. and it also does not give a variety of stations. I prefer PANDORA which has good wound quaily and creates stations but just puting a artist or a song.

B005KR6OBM|5.0|first we love this show, got the first 4 seasons. Every DVD was perfect, and in great shape, still is of course. Almost all my friends have barrowed them, and even my 7 year old grand daughter loves to watch the shows with me, again and again in the evenings in our Pajama's before bedtime when she stays over. She says, \\"Grams? Sometimes I don't understand Sheldon\\", lol, but that's ok, I told her to just ask me and I'd do my best to explain in 7 year old language, we just pause and then, she get's it once she asks, and we love the characters and appreciated the quick shipping & packaging, very much. I still have a couple of friends in line to barrow it, and more when we purchase more seasons thru here and for certain thru Amazon.<br />a sincere thank you, justkris
B006OFN0BQ|5.0|Eastwood's excellent film is a typical example of his preference for working within genre while at the same time creating refreshing variations on its basic themes. J Edgar comes on like a standard issue biopic as an elderly Hoover (Leonardo DiCaprio) dictates his memoirs to a succession of young agents about the founding of the FBI and its early triumphs under his leadership. But late in the game Eastwood and writer Dustin Lance Black spectacularly pull the rug out from under us by having Hoover's close friend and confidante Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer) declare that everything we've seen thus far has been a pack of lies. The question then becomes why and it's here that the point of Eastwood's film becomes clear. This isn't actually a biopic at all, it's really a tale of unrequited love, of Edgar's unrequited love, and of what happens when that love is denied and has to find another outlet.<br /><br />I've never been a fan of DiCaprio but I must concede that here he gives a compelling and sympathetic performance as J Edgar in a time period spanning the best part of five decades and it's a testament to the humanism of both the script and his performance that as monstrous as the character often is we never entirely lose our sympathy for a man whose loving instincts (his date with the young woman who ultimately becomes his lifelong secretary is an absolute hoot) are crushed by a domineering mother (Judi Dench) and the strictures of the time which made an open (and not necessarily physical) same sex relationship impossible. As the object of Edgar's affections Armie Hammer upstages the star with a touchingly heartfelt performance as Clyde Tolson and there are brief but strong supporting performances from Judi Dench as Mother and Naomi Watts as Edgar's loyal secretary Helen Gandy.<br /><br />For all its epic sweep - we see the young Edgar fighting communists in the early 1920's and his involvement in the Lindbergh kidnapping of the 30's - and the beautifully conceived flashback/forward structure (at one point the elderly Hoover and Tolson shuffle into a lift only to emerge from it as their younger dynamic selves 40 years earlier), the way these events are yoked to Edgar's psychology make this an almost suffocatingly interior film. Fatalistic, wreathed in shadows and unreliable memories, suffused with loss and shot through with a haunting, melancholy feel, it's a long way from your standard Hollywood biopic.<br /><br />At one point in Edgar's self-aggrandizing version of history a young black agent asks him which is more important, the organisation or the man who founded it. Edgar's reply is that there's no difference between the two and that's the tragedy of J Edgar. That prevented from developing a loving relationship he gave his all to the FBI with himself as its only permitted star. The result for Edgar was power, fame and fear, but never love. When Melvin Purvis shot John Dillinger, Hoover was so enraged at the prospect of the man's fame that he had him sidelined instantly. The film reveals that Hoover appears to have co-operated with Hollywood and commercial interests quite happily just so long as he was the beneficiary.<br /><br />One especially memorable moment has Edgar humiliated before a senate committee as one wily politician demands to know in light of Hoover's endorsement of umpteen commercial properties (everything from G-man movies to cereal boxes) how many arrests he's actually made (the answer: none). This comes as a real shock since up to this point we had no idea Edgar was so involved in promoting his own image. Eastwood is in his element here. The theme of image vs reality is one of the perennial themes of his work and runs through the likes of Flags of Our Fathers, Unforgiven, Invictus and many more.<br /><br />Of the wiretappings, illegal recordings and secret files Edgar amassed the film implicitly suggests that it was Edgar's own inability to express his love toward Tolson that fueled his abuse of power - hisattempted blackmail of Robert Kennedy, President Roosevelt, Martin Luther King, his hatred of longhairs, progressives, communists, blacks, hippies - all projections of his own tormented desires.<br /><br />One thing I particularly liked is the way that as Edgar gradually succumbs to his demons it's Tolson who becomes the voice of his conscience. In a key scene he warns Edgar away from an attempted blackmail of Martin Luther King. Ultimately it's too late to save Edgar but as the man ascends the stairs to his bedroom for the last time in his life there's a recognition from him that of all the things in the world, love is the strongest and most enduring of all. It's a very moving moment and topped in the scene following as Tolson weeps for the man he loved.<br /><br />This could be, in another director's hands (Oliver Stone for example,) incredibly salacious but Eastwood directs with real sensitivity - the attraction between Hoover and Tolson is instant and magnetic but avoids being exploitative or prurient. Indeed the 'was-J Edgar-gay?' question is much more open to interpretation here than you might suppose. This is about love, it's not about being gay and it most emphatically is not about sex. There's also a lovely nod towards those rumours about Edgar's supposed fondness for cross-dressing. The production values and sense of period are utterly believable and a remarkable achievement on a budget of some $35 million.<br /><br />J Edgar got a lukewarm reception from viewers and critics - liberals disliked its even-handed portrait of J Edgar while conservatives resented the implication that Hoover may have been gay and most viewers had little to no interest in an obscure historical figure - but the intelligent and perceptive script, the powerhouse performances and Eastwood's direction, mean, I suspect, that the reputation of J Edgar will only grow as the years go by. This is the kind of intelligent, mature film that Hollywood has all but given up making and if it wasn't for Eastwood's clout it likely never would have gotten made. Cautiously recommended then but don't go in expecting some standard Hollywood biopic. It really isn't that.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app was suggested to me by a close friend and I have enjoyed it thoroughly.  For group usage I have dropbox and for personal usage I have evermore.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I enjoy this game because it has multiple games inside of one. I also like it because its fun.its an awesome game
B005ZUR724|5.0|This is a great pocket game for people who are interested in playing this style of game on a more casual basis. The content is good, and the game does receives update. When I started playing there were 2 dungeon to run and now there are 4. Most people who give this a negative review do so because when the game receives a update for some reason the Kindle Fire version sometimes takes a day or so before it becomes available. I have found over  the 4-5 update that have happened in the last few months that contacting Amazon, and from time to time uninstall and reinstalling the game you will get it to work in time. You can level to 60(the cap) in a pretty reasonable amount of time especially if you use a double XP weekend, and even more so if you dont mind spending a little money on exp boosters (really not needed but on 2xp weekend you can really level fast this way). There are some other boosters that you can choose to buy, but you can def. get most things in this game without having to spend much real money if that your style. Subscription is only 50cents a months so if you choose to play it that way, this is a really cheap game to play as well. I really enjoy this game, feel free to come enjoy it with me.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Awesome but hard!  I really liked the game. reminded me of Mario games which I really like very much.  great.
B008COII1Y|4.0|I was expecting another fodder, forgettable zombie flick to fill an evening.  This is **NOT** that.  It is an extremely well written, well directed movie with great makeup effects, story, characters.  I put it on par with the better episodes of walking dead.  Well except with much better writing.
B00785P2QC|4.0|V city playground is good game. Needs better tutorials. Fun and easy to play. Four stars. Playing on a kindle fire.
B004LWZW4M|1.0|This was the dumbest movie I have seen in a long time.  A few key dumb points:<br /><br />1) A virus cannot create a genetic mutation that will take effect during an organism's lifetime.<br /><br />2) Intelligence is a result of lots of evolution.  You can't just make a brain 'intelligent' by changing a few things.  There are adaptations piled on adaptations, a maze of complexity that cannot be just started with a magic gas.<br /><br />3) Language is not something that chimps are physically capable of... even if they did become smart, no chimp is going to speak, it does not have the evolved throat organs.<br /><br />Overall, this movie was so dumb it hurt.  Every single part, from the acting to the story.  Just dumb.
B00881VLCE|3.0|I had a few issues with kindle fire. I couldn't place some of the pieces together until the end which was frustrating. The screen isn't big enough to hold the entire puzzle either so you have to move it around.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have read all three of these books and greatly enjoyed them.  These books have gotten a bad rap because of the sexual content, BUT there is a story and I mean a good story to follow here.  They kept me reading for hours and not wanting to put the books down.  Keep an open mind and if your offended by sexual content, look past the acts and follow the story....true life stuff, easy to read, funny, sad, sexy, entertaining, and very good!!  You may be surprised at who sways who to their lifestyle, does love win out....yes, it is a love story of sorts!!
B001PB3NWK|5.0|I've seen this movie several times, but each time I see it, I cannot stop crying; I don't know why. I am not sentimental at all, but this guy gets right to the heart; it breaks me down. Karol... my good friend... my good friend...
B000059T1V|4.0|~ Excellent performances by Muddy and his band consisting of James Cotton (harmonica), Otis Spann (piano), Pat Hare (guitar), Andrew Stephenson (bass), Francey Clay (drums), and of course Muddy on vocals and guitar.  Otis Spann does the vocals on \\"Goodbye Newport Blues\\", which prominently features his piano playing.<br />~ In addition to the tracks recorded live at Newport on 3 July 1960, there are four excellent studio tracks recorded in June 1960 by the same band.  Collectively this is Muddy and his men in top form.<br />~ The recorded sound for the live performances is good but not great, as evidenced by the superior sound of the four studio-recorded bonus tracks.  That plus the short time of the CD resulted in my reduction from five to four and a half stars.<br />~ Recommended as a good starting place to hear the music that influenced so many young British blues-rockers.

B007N85ZXY|5.0|Some people claiming this is a \\"terrible\\" album clearly aren't familiar with Neil's canon. Here are a few points to ponder:<br /><br />1. If nothing else, this is the most enjoyable Neil Young album in ages, maybe since Ragged Glory, to which this will inevitably (and not unreasonably) be compared. The musicians are having a palpable blast. To the degree that any Neil Young record could be called joyous, this is high on the list.<br /><br />2. It rocks. Somehow Neil Young and the musicians that comprise Crazy Horse speak a musical language only they know, but that they knew instantly; no song on this album would sound particularly out of place on 1969's Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere, their first album together. In a way, that's remarkable. They haven't \\"progressed\\" by any musical standard in 40-plus years. Like the Ramones, they play the style they play, and there's enough to explore there that there's no need to branch out. Or to learn any new chords for that matter. If his had been released as just \\"the new Neil Young and Crazy Horse album,\\" half the listeners would never make the connection that they're re-imagined folk songs because they sound like, well, Crazy Horse songs. Really good ones.<br /><br />3. Did I say they rock? High Flying Bird is as impassioned as Down By The River. She'll Be Coming 'Round The Mountain (yeah, I know it's Jesus' Chariot on the album, but that's not the title we all recognize it as) flat out rocks. And the vocal stutter leading into the chorus on \\"Oh, oh, oh Susannah?\\" I dare anyone upon first hearing it to say it's not instantly their favorite Neil Young song in recent memory.<br /><br />4. The closest it comes to what I feared it would be is an overly reverent reading of Woody Guthrie's This Land Is Your Land, but Neil takes care to sing ALL the verses, most of which could be considered both topical and political, so it transcends arrangement and becomes what it was always intended to be, a protest song, not a jingoistic anthem. I can hear arenas around the country ringing with the voices of thousands of people singing along during Neil's upcoming fall tour, his first with the full Crazy Horse in 16 years.<br /><br />5. And God Save The Queen, segueing into My Country Tis Of Thee? What could possibly go wrong? As it turns out, it may be the crowning achievement on the album, acting as a stately coda, a commentary on a personal journey (Neil is Canadian, after all, he sang this song every morning in school growing up, and this IS the Queen's Diamond Jubilee), or a historical perspective of the rich history of America itself, which began existence in subjugation to a monarch but declared independence and fought for it and continues to \\"...let freedom ring.\\"<br /><br />6. No other artist or band could have made this record, and certainly no other band from \\"the Sixties.\\" Enjoy it; it sure sounds like they did. Oh, and the videos for each song, along with the 45-minute promo \\"silent\\" film Neil made promoting the album, are brilliant. This is the Indian Summer of rock and roll. Enjoy it while you can.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|All I can  say  is that this author has an amazing publicist.  This first book is a big waste of time and money. I do not plan to invest either money or time in reading the other books.  I bought this book  out of curiosity given all the hype on TV.  The story writing is so poor.  I like the other reader's comment how she looked up while reading the book to see if the author was really a teenager.  Nothing what you expect happens until at least page 50 and then after that you just keep pushing to read on to see why is everyone so gaga about this book.  And there really isn't even that much sex in the book.  Maybe if you read all 3 books then you have a complete story but I want a lot more from the author for my efforts spent reading and pushing through several hundred pages.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is amazing.... I love it.... it always entertains me. I'm always the one to point out the negetive of things but in this case there is none-zip-zero. I don't know how to describe how awsome this game is! my opinion-get it!!! p.s. its free

B001AXKXBW|5.0|The vast majority of albums are just a collection of songs that have nothing to do with each other.  And there are plenty of great albums that were made that way.  Then there are albums that have common themes, i.e. Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon or Avenged Sevenfold's Nightmare.  And finally there are concept albums, such as the Who's Tommy, Queensryche's Operation Mindcrime, and alas Dream Theater's Scenes from a Memory.  The concept album reaches the ideal of what an album should be: a musical journey.  It tells a story in more ways than just lyrics.<br /><br />In my opinion the 3 best albums of all time are 3) The Who - Tommy, 2) Symphony X - V: The New Mythology Suite, and 1) Dream Theater - Scenes from a Memory. None of these albums even contains the best song by each of those bands.  But as an ALBUM, they are far superior.  When we review albums here on Amazon or elsewhere, we shouldn't be reviewing individual songs.  The only songs off of this album I would even put in Dream Theater's top 10 songs is Home, but together these 12 tracks create an absolute masterpiece of music - the closest to perfection that any musicians have ever come.  The flow from track to track is flawless.  And it only takes a few listens to tell what the story is about.  The instrumentals are, per usual Dream Theater, incredible to say the least.  But with the common melodies of the album, I think it took even more brilliance than the guys had shown before and have shown since.<br /><br />People criticize DT for being too technical and not being imaginative, showing off and being robots sometimes.  Some of the reviews of this album even say that.  I can hear that argument for maybe the intro solo on The Glass Prison or maybe the solo on In The Name of God, but none of Petrucci's solos on this album.  If you can listen to the solo on The Spirit Carries On and tell me that no thought went into that writing and that he's just playing scales, I think you should get your hearing checked.  In fact, it's one of the only Petrucci solos that I can actually play, since it's quite far from technical prowess.<br /><br />All that being said, this type of music isn't for everybody.  There are people on here rating it one star saying they had a prog rock phase back in the 70s or something like that.  They clearly changed their styles, just as Rush and Yes did (still love them, just preferred their progressive works from the 70s over their radio friendly stuff of the 80s).  This album is very complex.  At some points its heavy and loud.  At other points its mellow and ballad-like.  There's even a ragtime riff from Rudess.  It pushes the envelope and thinks outside the box.  So far outside the box that most folks just don't understand it.  And that's too bad.  Because it is simply the best album that anyone has ever made.<br /><br />Also, if you like this stuff, I highly recommend V: The New Mythology Suite by Symphony X. A bit heavier and louder but another absolute masterpiece.
B008ASLK8A|4.0|By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MS<br /><br />Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is successful largely because of good story line, breathtaking effects and the superior acting of Robert Downey, Jr. as Sherlock and Jude Law as Dr. Watson.<br />It's so refreshing to see Robert on his game after several years of sorting out his problems with alcohol and drugs.<br />The story, loosely based on Conan Doyle's short story The Final Problem, puts our heroes in an all out war with a cunning adversary, Professor Moriaty (Jared Harris).  Producers and directors made the decision to make Game of Shadows a stand-alone film, which didn't require viewers to have seen the first one, Sherlock Holmes.<br />Sherlock is his usual quirky self working on interior-camouflage, secretly trying to sabotage Dr. Watson's wedding, thinking through outcomes of fights before they happen and even donning women's clothing, as a means of keeping his identity secret.<br />\\"I just put on some make-up. I thought I looked like Arnold Schwarzenegger's dwarf brother, or the lead singer of The Cure, Robert Smith,\\" Robert said.<br />The first movie grossed $209 odd million, the second was commercially successful with a worldwide gross of over $540 million. We all know what that means.<br />Warner Bros. has announced that the first draft for Sherlock Holmes 3 is being produced with screenwriter Drew Pearce writing the script.

1400069289|5.0|A 2006 Duke University study found that some forty percent of what we do every day is habit. That is, we don't make decisions every day about how we're going to, say, brush our teeth--which hand to hold the brush in, when to turn on the water, how long to brush. It's a routine that we consciously settled on at some point, but it has long since become automatic, something we do without thinking, a habit. This is good, because if we had to make decisions about every single action we take in our lives every day, it would be paralyzing, and we would have no time to think about more interesting stuff. So it's vital that our lives are filled with these routines, these habit loops, although the habits themselves, of course, can be either good or bad. In The Power of Habit Charles Duhigg talks about the habits of individuals, businesses, and societies, using examples of each to show how habits work for good or ill in real life. He discusses, for example, how Starbucks instills willpower in its workers by inculcating good habits, how Target profiles its customers based on their habitual purchases, how the new CEO of Alcoa turned the company around by focusing on the institution's habits related to worker safety. The most interesting part of the book, however, is Duhigg's discussion of how habits work, how they can be created, and how bad habits can, with work, be reprogrammed. It's really a fascinating read.<br /><br />-- Debra Hamel

B007P6VLRS|5.0|I'll come out and admit that I am a Smashing Pumpkins fan, but not a diehard one. Though not the most loyal of followers, the band has a special significance in my life. From what I hear, the only original member of Smashing Pumpkins present for Oceania is frontman Billy Corgan. This album suggests one thing to me: Billy Corgan IS the Smashing Pumpkins. I'm sure there are plenty of loyal followers that would disagree and there are also bound to be those who feel slighted by the album because it is not the exact same thing they've been listening to for decades. Oceania isn't Gish. It's not Siamese Dream or Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness. Plenty will be relieved to hear that Oceania isn't Zeitgeist. Good bands mature and their music matures with them. Sorry if this bothers you but you'll get over it. Oceania is deep and dreamy, sweeping and epic. This is no longer the garage rock of the 90's but a progression of alternative that beautifully demonstrates that Billy Corgan is still relevant to the music industry.<br /><br />\\"Quasar\\" - What a great way to get the blood pumping! This is an excellent intro to the album, sure to get you hammering on the air-drums and strumming electric riffs on your air-guitar. Welcome back Smashing Pumpkins, where have you been all my life?<br /><br />\\"Panopticon\\" - This feels sort of like a continuation of the previous track, a bit like a stroll through the valley after an intense rush down the mountain. This track isn't any weaker for that reason, but it does feel like a companion. We are still getting into the groove and soaking in the mellow waves.<br /><br />\\"The Celestials\\" - Ahhh beautiful. Simply beautiful. This one is so freaking catchy. I previewed this album on iTunes for free before it was released. I heard this song once and found myself singing it days later. The lyrics are great, accompanied by some excellent melodies. This is one of my favorites of the entire album.<br /><br />\\"Violet Rays\\" - This song has a fantastic intro. This song is closer to the grunge roots than most of the songs, it definitely channels the melancholy darkness of the older SP songs.<br /><br />\\"My Love is Winter\\" - This is another song that harkens back to the older SP but in an entirely good way. The use of synth gives this song a dreamy sort of quality, reminding me of some of the 80's synth-rock.<br /><br />\\"One Diamond One Heart\\" - This song continues with that 80s synth-rock vibe but to a much greater degree, and I love it. There is a very light and uplifting, pop sound to this track.<br /><br />\\"Pinwheels\\" - And this is another favorite on an album full of favorites. More synth followed by intimate acoustics and catchy lyrics. There were fans around the world lifting lighters in the air as a salute to this song before it even released. That's just the kind of song this is.<br /><br />\\"Oceania\\" - This is a looong song, and a multi-parter at that. The first part is somewhat haunting, the second is much warmer and acoustic, the third part is heavier but still retains some of those same haunting melodies of the beginning accompanied by wicked sweet guitar riffs,<br /><br />\\"Pale Horse\\" - This is my least favorite of the album. It's not that there is anything wrong with this song, it certainly has its own merits, it just doesn't do it for me. This is a slower one but I do like the female background vocals, they add a nice touch.<br /><br />\\"The Chimera\\" - This song is awesome. It is reminiscent of \\"Cherub Rock\\" from Siamese Dream. You can really jam to this one and once again the lyrics are just spectacular.<br /><br />\\"Glissandra\\" - Another solid song, though not the top of the batch. I prefer the music over the lyrics in this one.<br /><br />\\"Inkless\\" - There is a guitar riff in this song that I cannot wait to hear live. It is super. This is quite definitely a Smashing Pumpkins love song, grab your girl and take her somewhere you can see the stars and just lay in the grass and listen.<br /><br />\\"Wildflower\\" - A great closer, fully encompassing the ethereal quality that is so present in this album. Spacey and dreamy, just the way guitarist Jess Schroeder promised. Moving on an emotional level.<br /><br />Oceania is a beautiful album. There are echoes of past albums but no one will claim that this is in anyway stale material. This is grunge, but the grunge of a dreamer who has matured past adolescence. Complex and wistful, this album will sweep you away and carry you someplace wholesome. I love this album. To me it is a fierce contender for the best of 2012. This proves that the 90's may be over but 90's music has only expanded in quality. Last year the Foo Fighters returned to their roots with the tremendously awesome Wasting Light.

B0000696I0|1.0|The main reason why I didin't like this movie is because Shredder came back for a second time.That may seem pretty dumb to you,but sorry folks.I just don't get it.Warning:Spoilers Ahead. How did Shredder manage to survive being crushed in a garbage truck,but he couldn't survive a pile of wood from a falling dock,crashing down on him,when he was a HUGE \\"Super\\" Shredder??? That doesn't make ANY sense to me.I think they should have used a diffrent villain for this movie.I think The Ratking would have been an awesome villain choice.The storyline in this is fair,but sorry.The whole \\"bringing back Shredder thing\\" just ruins this movie for me.

B0088XXCZ6|5.0|This album is absolutely amazing. While I wasn't thrilled at the version of Extraordinary Machine that was released (I preferred the rougher \\"leaked\\" album), Idler is a completely realized, beautiful album. I've always loved Fiona for her unique voice, blunt/beautiful lyrics and playfulness, all of which is here on Idler but darker, more passionate and more..dare I say...mature.<br /><br />Fiona is at her full power, really coming-into-her own here. Standout tracks: Every Single Night, HotKnife, Valentine.
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|I skipped seeing this one in theaters when it was originally released.  There were some VERY lackluster reviews.  Just watched the film and all I can say is 'WOW!'.  After a long day, I just wanted to 'turn off' for 2 hrs and watch a movie. I figured worst case, I would have some mediocre action.  Boy, was I wrong.  I loved the entire story.  Don't believe the reviews that panned this move.  It was great from beginning to end.  Terrific action and a winner from Disney.<br /><br />While I'm not particularly fond of Taylor Kitcsch (sp?) in general, I thought he nailed this movie as the lead.  Great characters (especially the 'alien dog' sidekick) and complete 'hero's journey' storyline.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B007P3TMW2|4.0|This movie gives a sensitive portrayal of how a \\"differently abled\\" boy deals with the death of his father. Without sermonizing or being sappy, it shows that each person reacts to loss in his/her own way; but that we all share the need to be accepted and valued. In a larger context, the movie was about how all of us survived the horror and losses of 9/11.
B00006JL1Z|2.0|Fleetwood Mac are a Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inducted group, and deservedly so. Dating back to the mid-1960s, under Peter Green's leadership, this band has managed to churn out some of the finest rock, pop, and blues music (very diverse, can't you tell) ever made. These guys pioneered the British blues rock genre, created some great straight-ahead rock and roll in the early-1970s and became the kings (and queens) of soft rock in the mid-1970s all the way through to today. They are truly one of the most diverse groups (in terms of musical stylings in the rock genre) you can find anywhere.<br /><br />So, needless to say, my two-star rating does not come from the fact that I dislike Fleetwood Mac. Just the opposite. I consider myself to be a huge fan, in fact. So this is not a \\"Fleetwood Mac sucks\\" review. So before you hit that \\"not helpful\\" button just because I gave one of their albums two stars, I ask you to keep reading and you'll see why.<br /><br />Not too long ago, Warner Bros. released 'The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac,' a 2-CD collection. When I first heard about its release, I was quite excited. No, I wasn't going to buy it, as I already had most of Fleetwood Mac's stuff. But I was excited for the newcomers to this band, as I felt that the 1988 'Greatest Hits' album just didn't do this band justice. The group released plenty of fine music after 1988 (I must be one of the few people that likes 'Behind the Mask') and before 1975 (when Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks joined this group). I found that collection horribly outdated.<br /><br />When this was released, boy was I let down. Once again, this collection failed to reach the mark. It failed miserably. MISERABLY. This collection starts with the 1975 self-titled album and goes through to 1997. If you bought this collection and nothing but, you'd be led to believe that Fleetwood Mac did not have a history prior to 1975. WRONG! This band had released plenty of music prior to 1975, and I'll go a step furtherand say some of the band's best music came before 1975.<br /><br />Yeah, yeah, if you want nothing but the Buckingham-Nicks period of Fleetwood Mac, you'll be beyond satisfied with this collection. But if you truly want the \\"very best of\\" Fleetwood Mac, you aren't gonna find it here. Maybe a better title would be 'The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac 1975-1997.' But as it is, this is false advertising by Warner Bros. The group shuns the recently deceased Bob Welch albums, like 'Future Games,' 'Bare Trees' (my personal favorite Fleetwood Mac album), and 'Penguin,' among others, and even the monumental Peter Green-led albums like 'Then Play On.'<br /><br />Now, normally, it is record company pressure that prevents a complete collection. Not in this instance. While some of the Peter Green-era albums are owned by Sony BMG, everything from 'Then Play On' onwards is owned by Warner Bros. That's right. The label owns the masters. Why did they blow it like this? They could have assembled a truly comprehensive Fleetwood Mac collection, and instead, we pretty much have a deluxe edition of the 1988 'Greatest Hits' album. It's frustrating beyond belief if you are devoted fan like I am.<br /><br />Bring on the \\"you aren't a true Fleetwood Mac fan\\" comments. I'm ready for them. This collection features plenty of essentials, like 'Don't Stop,' 'Rhiannon,' 'Go Your Own Way,' 'You Make Loving Fun,' and just about every other essential track recorded from 1975-1997. But it just isn't enough to recommend. This group had so much history before Buckingham-Nicks joined the fold, and in this instance, the negatives FAR outweigh the positives.<br /><br />My recommendation: It's costly, I know, but if you really want to appreciate Fleetwood Mac, you have to buy the studio albums and 'The Dance,' the essential 1997 live album and the reunion album as well. Start with 'Rumours,' then get 'Fleetwood Mac,' 'Mirage,' 'Future Games,' and keep adding from there. Eventually, if you like what you're hearing, you'll get them all eventually anyway. This album deserves two stars, simply because a group like Fleetwood Mac deserves so much better than what's being offered here.<br /><br />Not recommended.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|If you were an Assistant DA and your son was charged with murder what would you do?  That is what Andy Barber has to decide.  Everything in his life has been about following rules and becoming a good husband and father as well as a respected member of the community.  As the story unfolds so does the family drama and the family lies.  Sometimes the parents, especially the father is not quite believable but the twists and turns more than made up for this.  It was a puzzle that added one piece at a time and kept it interesting until the very end.<br />This is a very interesting mixture of family issues and legal issues.  You may think you know what is coming, but you never know what the next page will bring, much less the end of the book. What will win: parental skills, the law, or unconditional love?
0062197258|5.0|This debut is stunningly realistic and may have one of the most illustrative examples of Obsessive Compulsion Disorder (OCD) that readers will ever find. The scary thing is the reason behind that behavior. You see, Catherine Bailey had not always felt the need to spend an hour checking and rechecking her locks, the doors, the windows. Like many who are abused beyond endurance, it came as she sought...protection...and freedom from fear...<br /><br />But she never really succeeded... The Corner beckoned always... And dreams of the red dress...<br /><br />First I want to comment on the beautiful hardback cover that complements the novel published by Harper Collins. The paper cover of the book is more sinister representing the thriller; however, the cover itself is worthy, in my opinion, of allowing the book to be casually left on a side table and clearly will be a lovely addition to your personal library. Catherine wears the red dress and stands in front of a window...the dress had become a symbol of the torment, the control that she had been forced to endure for so long. The back shows the dress hanging on a limb--has she tossed it away or did something else happen to her?<br /><br />The thing about Lee Anthony Brightman was that he was so charming and handsome that many of her friends thought she was lucky to have him, and even implied they would be interested if she separated from him...<br /><br />And during the trial, Lee had continuously lied about her being jealous, accused him of having affairs, and much more. Fortunately, though, he had been convicted and was now in jail.<br /><br />But it had never ended for Catherine. She was changed.<br /><br />So much so that when a man moved into the apartment above hers, he soon recognized the signs--the need to ensure the front door to the building was completely shut, the extra checking to see that the door to her own apartment was definitely locked...she counted them--she checked each six times. Stuart, who was a psychologist, began to slowly interact with her and a relationship was developing. However, when Catherine started to notice that things seemed to have been moved in her apartment, she didn't know whether it was really happening or not. Stuart didn't support her until the woman in the downstairs apartment had been attacked--something was definitely happening, but the things changed in her apartment were like what Lee had done to torment her. But Lee was still in jail...<br /><br />Catherine suffered from PTSD, manifested outwardly through OCD. It was a terrifying experience that had changed her to the person she now was. The trauma of what Lee was doing to her in secret, while from the outside, everybody thought they had a wonderful relationship, is chilling and sometimes disturbing to read. Fortunately, the author takes readers to different time periods which not only breaks up the tension, but provides the background to Catherine's relationship with Lee and friends of hers at that time. But the real Lee is so abusive that readers will want to run and protect Catherine in some scenes! Be prepared for violence and sexual abuse.<br /><br />This is not an easy book to read, but I commend the author for this work. She's done an outstanding job in representing Catherine, both in being willing to write and show what led to her psychological issues, as well as her efforts to regain control of her life. An unforgettable story; a fascinating psychological thriller! Suspenseful--keeps you on edge until the last page!<br /><br />Highly recommended!<br /><br />GABixlerReviewshologist, began to slowly interact with her and a relationship was developing.

0307341550|5.0|This was the last of Gillian Flynn's three books that I read and I thought that it was the best of all.  It had a little of all of our human failings.<br />Even as a feminist I can enjoy the strong, if disturbing females in this book.  It is set in a small town that many can relate to, with an upper class at all levels from middle school to adults that dominate and bully others.  The main character, Camille who has escaped to Chicago and works for a small newspaper is sent back to cover the second murder of a young girl.  She has problems of her own which are execrated by her trip home to an unloving mother, strange stepsister and dysfunctional stepfather.<br />Some reviews said that the stepsister and mother were not believable because they were too much of a caricatures but I have known people who may not have gone quite that far, but have gone way too far.  If you have ever been around mean people, or have even watched the news on a regular basis you know they exist.<br />This is a book you may read quickly but will haunt you for a long time.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book has made me look at my relationship in a whole new light. Everybody thought this book was about porn and dirty sex for the more mature minds it was one of the greatest love stories I have ever read. As well as sexy and completely hot. I would obey my husband if he would treat me the way she get's treated with the attention and gifts.
B002GYVRRI|4.0|First let me say that this has always been one of my favorite KC albums, and if I was just rating the music, 5 stars easily, but most of us know that already and I'm just reviewing the main reason to buy this, the 5.1.  This is the first (and currently only though I just ordered Discipline) of the 40th that I have purchased, though I have heard In the Court and Lizard.  It may be the way it was recorded originally (I'm not an expert and don't claim to be), but I don't find myself too excited about the 5.1.  And when I listen to it compared to other 70s albums released in surround, Dark Side, Elton John albums, Clapton (all on SACD if that really matters in the comparison) the quality just doesn't equal them.  Those other bands had deep pockets I'm sure as well, and maybe the goal of the production was to sound distorted unlike Lizard (which sounded freaking awesome and is probably my next purchase).  It's easily the best it has sounded with the stereo tracks (at least the MLP ones, haven't listened to the companion CD) and maybe the best it could possibly sound due to the source.  Of course this is just my uneducated opinion and the notes state that Steve Wilson basically left the mix alone when he was working on it because it sounded so good.  \\"The quality of the sounds going down onto tape is terrific.  Unlike earlier albums, where they had to do an unbelievable amount of EQ to try and make up for the deficiencies of the studio sound in the mix, with Red you just push the faders up and it simply takes your head off.\\"-Steven Wilson  Maybe I need my hearing checked!  :)
B006X08FDA|5.0|Excellent Group and a great CD. I really enjoy listening to this group and their new line  up continues the fine music for which the award winning group is known. If you have an opportunity to see the group live, don't miss them.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|I love it because its very organized and I can keep notes and also check the date! I like just got it and I'm all over!

B0086700CM|5.0|I looooooove this game! soooo much fun! survival of the fittest. running for your life and monkeys! fun! you just have to be foocused and before you know it you have a high score.
B000084T18|4.0|I find listening to this recording much more entertaining than most other Rap recorded these days.  It seems that most Hip-Hop and Rap is going the way of Rock ... downhill.  So this stands out a bit for not boring me to death.  Sadly, as good as this album is for today I can't help but think that the bite has been lost, the beast has been tamed.  So enjoy, soon nothing good will be left.
0767817664|5.0|I realize this movie is going on 30 years old.  It might seem \\"old\\" to many viewers.  But the fact that it is colorfully set in suburban America of the mid-80's, and not in some B&W Hollywood version of Transylvania, (complete with creepy castles and torch bearing villagers) - make it, to me at least, a more or less modern day setting.  Certainly contemporary for its time, and with very few exceptions, it has maintained a fresh and modern look about it.<br /><br />Charlie Brewster, a typically under-achieving teen, seems to have but two passions in his life:  His love of horror movies, locally presented on late night TV by faded B-movie actor Peter Vincent.  And his girlfriend Amy, whose pants Charlie is desperately trying to get into.  When he spots his new next door neighbor carrying what looks like a coffin into his house late one night, the stage is set for one of the funniest, scariest, and most entertaining vampire films ever made.  All of the aforementioned events take place during the first five minutes.  After that, it's just full-on frightening fun.  Charlie soon begins spying on his neighbor from his bedroom window, and quickly learns just what the purpose of that sinister looking coffin is!<br /><br />Beautifully crafted, well-written, and expertly acted, Fright Night delivers the goods on so many levels.  The scares work, the humor works, and the expertly done special effects hold their own against any other film of the period.  Chris Sarandon is perfect as vampire Jerry Dandridge.  His outward demeanor exudes a cool, sexy charm, while beneath burns the vicious, tortured monster who will stop at nothing to get what he wants (in this case, Charlie's girlfriend Amy), and ensure his own survival.  Roddy McDowall gives a brilliantly hammy performance as Peter Vincent, the \\"great vampire killer\\" from his long-since passed days in low budget horror movies.  I simply cannot imagine any other two actors playing those roles (I have yet to see the 2011 remake).I suppose any two good young actors of the day could have played Charlie and Amy, but William Ragsdale and Amanda Bearse made those roles their own.  And Stephen Geoffreys delivers a wonderfully likable comic portrayal of Charlie's friend, \\"Evil\\" Ed.<br /><br />The film takes a very deliberate timeline, deftly maintaining a perfect balance between the humor and the horror.  In many ways, it goes one better in that department than my other favorite horror/comedy from the 80's, An American Werewold In London.  As much as I love AAWIL, the humor in it can occasionally seem a bit forced or out of place.  Not so in Fright Night.  It hits all the marks in perfect sequence, and results in a delightfully scary roller coaster ride of a movie.<br /><br />As I mentioned, I have not seen last year's remake with Colin Farrell and David Tennant, so I cannot compare the two.  I will have to make it a point to watch it someday.  But I have seen the direct sequel to 1985's Fright Night, and while entertaining in its own way, it simply cannot hold a stake to the original.  To me, the original Fright Night became an instant classic immediately upon its release, with its perfect blend of acting, story, and direction, the latter two both courtesy of Tom Holland (Child's Play, also with Chris Sarandon).  A perfect example of fun film making from the 80's that has scarcely aged at all, and today is as fresh, frightening, and funny as it was almost three decades ago.  Fright Night is... for REAL...!
B007R41E8O|5.0|I was hesitant to purchase this app. because of the negative reviews; but I'd downloaded other games with the extra download and all were extremely slow so I decided that wasn't a factor. I'm glad I did. The story line was very good. I did have to use the hint button a lot at the end to tell me which direction I needed to go in, but there are endless hints and no long waits for it to reload, so no problem. The game lasted a decent length too. I even got a good laugh at the ending having forgotten the ominous beginning! Sit back, be patient and enjoy!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love this book and the other two that follow the sequence.  Each book keeps you wanting more and to find out what is going to happen next. I couldn't put them down.  I hope the author writes more novels.  I will for sure buy them.
B000B5XOSO|4.0|This will be the last 20 years ago or 2002 for the month of June but this series of reviews will step up in July. This is 20 years ago Batman Returns. This movie caught got a lot of heat the stuff it implies along with the violence. Mostly by the parents groups & PETA cause they didn't like the fact that they strapped rockets to Penguins. It was directed by Tim Burton he directed The 1989 Batman movie which is my favorite Batman movie. As well he directed Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, Mars Attacks unfortantly not a fan of Mars Attacks & Sleepy Hallow. It stars Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne & Batman, Danny DeVito as The Penguin, Michelle Pfiffer as Selina Kyle & Cat Woman, Christopher Walken as Max Shreck, Michael Gough as Alfred & Pat Hingle as Commissoner Gordon. The story is this family called The Cobblepot's have this disfigured son that they throw in the sewer. While the carriage is going through the sewers you have the credits hit while that amazing Danny Elfman score is playing. The carriage washes up to a bunch of Penguins. Then you fast forward 33 years later where you are introduced to Max Schreck a business man who wants to build a power plant. You have this tree lighting cermony. The Penguin sends a giant gift box & members of The Red Triangle Circus pop out & start trashing down town Gotham & attacking civilians. Commissoner Gordon tells an officer to send out the signal. This scene is great where The Bat Signal goes out you have Bruce Wayne sitting in a chair where he gets up & heads out. Batman goes in takes them down with The Bat Mobile. You have 1 of the clowns grab Selina Kyle who were introduced to. Batman shoots a hook through a wall pulls it out & kills him. Then you have Max Schreck taken to the sewer where he meets The Penguin he wants him to help him find out who his parents are he wants to be accepted by the public cause he has a lot of information that could ruin Max Schreck. He agrees to help. In the original script Max Schreck & The Penguin were going to be revealed to be brothers.  So anyway Selina Kyle forgot to get the files for Max Schreck's meeting coming up with Bruce Wayne. So Selina goes back & gets the filies she gets into some of Max's secret filies Where Max throws her out a window. Now I know people nit pick this Schreck is a rich corperate guy he could make it suicide. A group of cats start biting her & bring her back to life. She goes back home & has a breakdown & makes a Cat suit & becomes Cat Woman. The Mayor is making a speech on on what happpend the night before a clown comes up from the sewer where it grabs The Mayor's baby from his wife's arms. To stage a ploy by The Penguin to make it look like he saved the baby he comes up from the sewer & tells everybody that he wants to find out who his parents are. He is at The Hall Of Records making a list of The 1st Born Sons in Gotham. Bruce Wayne is looking up information on The Red Triangle Circus he's looking in old newspaper reports he finds out a bunch of kids went missing during 1 of their performances. Cat Woman makes her 1st apperance she saves this woman that's being mugged she takes her claws & cuts this guys face up. She then tells this woman that you make it so easy always waiting for some Batman to save you she says I am Cat Woman hear me roar. Schreck is setting up a recall to get The Mayor voted & replace him with The Penguin. Then you have some of The Penguin's henchies destroying the down town area again so Penguin can make The Mayor look weak on crime. Batman comes in cleans house he tosses  Baterange takes down some of the goons. This Poodle grabs it. Also Cat Woman is in Schrek's Department Store trashing it. Cat Woman puts a bunch of flamable spray cans in this microwave & cuts a gas line. Outside Batman knocks out this clown with a bomb strapped to him he takes it then you have this big dude who says yeah go ahead & hit me so he goes ahead & does it. Batman attached the bomb to him & throws him into a man hole where he blows up. Batman has a confrontation with The Penguin Catwoman comes out she says meow & Schreck's Department Store blows up. Batman & Cat Woman have a fight quick fight it had some pretty good coreography. When Batman hits her she says how could I'm a woman. So she can get a cheap shot in. Batman throws some kind of acid bomb on her arm. The realationship between these 2 is done well. She wants to make out with him she sticks 1 of her claws in him. Batman knocks off the building where she falls into a dump truk full of Cat Litter. Cat Woman forms an alliance with The Penguin she wants to frame Batman while Penguin is going to have a bomb placed on The Bat Mobile. There is going to be a relighting of the tree. The Penguin takes The Baterange that The Dog caught the night before uses it to knock out The Ice Princes. Bruce Wayne & Selina Kyle have a realationship going on there having dinner at his house this scene they kind of know  who they really  are. Then you have a special repot where Commissoner Gordon tells that The Ice Princess has been kidnapped & Batman might be behind it. Bruce tells Alfred to make something up. Selina leaves & tells the same thing to him. Bruce sets off as Batman he sets off to find where The Ice Princess is at. The Red Triangle gang is going through The Batmobile & they place a bomb on it. Batman finds The Ice Princess. Cat Woman attacks him they have a quick fight Cat Woman grabs The Ice Princess & takes her to the roof. The Penguin tosses an umbrella where a bunch of bats fly out & she falls to her death. Some cops go up their where they shoot Batman & he falls to another side of the building Cat Woman goes up to him he gets up & tosses her to the side. Penguin is trying to hit on The Cat Woman who wants nothing to do with him he takes his umbrella & puts it around her neck it carries her off she gets loose & she falls into some kind of green house. Batman gets back to The Batmobile where The Penguin shows up on screen he says \\"Welcome to The Oswald Cobblepot School of driving ladies & gentlemen start your screaming!\\" He has control of The Batmobile The Penguin says \\"Maybe this is a bad time to mention this but my license is expired.\\" Batman records the stuff that The Penguin is saying how he played them for fools. Batman finds the bomb before The Batmobile hits an old lady. Penguin loses control over The Batmobile. The next The Penguin is giving a campaign speech where Bruce & Alfred hack into it they play what he said the night before his supporters turn against him of course. They start throwing fruit & vegtables at him. Penguin says that why does someone always bring eggs & tomatoes to a speech. He opens fire on them & runs back to the sewers. He says to his henchies \\" My name is not Oswald Cobblepot it's Penguin! I'm not a human being cold blooded cranck up The AC!\\" He reveals his real plan to take all The 1st born sons of Gotham & drown them. 1 of his henchies asks isn't that a little. Penguin shoots him & he says it's a lot. Max Schreck is having a Christmas Party Bruce Wayne is there sohe can see his new woman Selina Kyle. She tells him that she is going to kill Max Schreck. Penguin comes in where he tells everybody that there kids are being taken away & he's going to take Max's son Chip. Max reasons with The Penguin to take him instead so he takes him instead. There using this train thing to transport all these kids Batman shows up & stops them he takes down The Organ Grinder & there is this monkey that The Organ Grinder had Batman gives him a note to give to The Penguin it says I regret to inform you that the children are unable to attend. Danny DeVito does a good job with the reaction. Batman is trying to find out where The Penguin's location is at this also brought in a new vehicle The Bat Boat. The Penguin has sent an army of Penguins to Town Square Alfred helps him redirect them back from where they came from to find out where The Penguin is at. Penguin gets in this duck vehicle Batman crashes his boat into it where Penguin jumps him & he takes this remote where & pushes the button where The Penguins fire rockets & destroy The Zoo. A swarm of bats fly into Penguin's face where you think he has fell to his death. Schreck has escaped from his cage Cat Woman is there ready to kill him. Batman jumps in & tries to stop her where he umasks I know the fanboys hate this but he cares about this woman is how I take it. Shreck shoots Batman Max starts firing at Selina Kyle & she has 9 lives like a cat each time she is shot she keeps counting them down. When the gun runs out of bullits Selina takes a loose wire & a stun gun & kills him. The Penguin comes up with 1 last grasp of life & tells Batman \\"I'll murder you momentarly but 1st I need a cold drink of ice water.\\" So then it goes to Bruce thinking that he saw Cat Woman & he tells Alfred to stop the car he looks around finds a cat. Alfred tells him Merry Christmas Bruces says good will to men & women. Camera pans up you see Cat Woman on a roof top. Tim Burton did a good job directing. Michael Keaton was great this would be the last time he played Batman. Danny DeVito did a very good job. You could tell he was having fun. Michelle Pfiffer was great. Christopher Walken did a good job but I've never seen him give a bad performance. Michael Gough was good he was good in all 4 movies. Pat Hingle was fine in his role as The Commissoner. This is a good sequel not as good as the 89 movie. It's still a good sequel you can get it with all 4 movies in The Antholgy set that has a lot of good features on it.  This series will pick up more next month.

0060873027|2.0|If you stand on your lawn, I once read, the ground beneath you is teaming with life in a murderous struggle. The definition of sanity and insanity is quite simple; the sane chose to ignore that fact, the insane are all too aware of it. This book is about a group of people who are shrunk and abandoned in the wild, amongst the beetles and spiders, ants and wasps... and murder certainly unfolds.<br />This could have been such a good book, certainly the storyline is exciting and interesting - but the writing... well THAT'S a crime against literature! I don't know quite what it is but I think it's the sentence structure... short sentences with very little description ; \\"Harry met Sally. Sally was a girl. Harry was a boy. They went out together. They had a good time\\" ...that sort of thing - like a sketch that has been badly filled out. The characters are cardboard cutouts - no personality.<br />What WAS good about this book is that it reminded me of a good read I once had about miniaturised men struggling to survive in a garden and then sent as spies into Eastern Europe; \\"Cold War in a Country Garden\\". I've now tracked down a copy which I shall enjoy reading again... better than this sad effort!

B007I2BZIE|5.0|I won't bore you with what everyone else has said and there are some great commentaries here, but what I can add is that from the first moment I heard this album, I know this concert is going to be LOUD!  I saw the Time Machine tour last year (plus many, many others dating back to Exit, Stage Left at the Hammersmith in London - ouch!) and besides being awesome, it was loud.  This tour is going to blow the doors off anything before, I can feel it and I can't hardly wait!<br /><br />This album is amazing in that as full of sound the whole mix is, each instrument is crystal clear, rock on, and blasting forward.  And yet the whole thing together is an amazing symphony of texture, fillling full every frequency range your speakers can put out.  Just beautiful.  And damn, these guys can still jam!  Better than ever; its almost like watching them reach a new pinnacle of rock exactness precision sound surround perfection!<br /><br />See you all at the next show!
B0079J28NW|5.0|This is a fantastic Blu Ray! There is so much more detail in the picture and sound it is reference quality.I can remember seeing the original film at the local town hall at the end of 1968,seen it on TV over the years, had the video and have the DVD. The DVD was not an anamorphic picture and although mastered as well as possible for the time it is not a patch on this new stunning Blu Ray.If I have any complaint at all it is what happened to George Martin's isolated orchestral score a great feature on the DVD .The Blu Ray has the original mono sound mix in all its compressed,distorted glory it didnt need to be used we could of had a beautifully remastered orchestral track instead.

0425263908|3.0|I read this book in one sitting without putting it down, but at the same time wasn't sure why I was so intent on finishing it.<br /><br />*SPOILERISH*<br />The way Gideon first propositioned Eva was insulting and despite  sexually charged feelings for him I lost respect for her the instant she caved for him.  Apparently sexual harassment doesn't exist when you are rich and strikingly handsome. I found their first discussions disturbing, and I find it laughable how quickly he went from not being interested in any type of relationship with her to wanting to own her like a possession and control her every move after only one sexual encounter. And although I understand they both had tortured pasts, I couldn't get over how quickly Eva caved every time he mistreated her. I agreed with another reviewer also, the sex scenes were over done and sometimes less is more. And I've felt that intense sexual charge with a man before (although I suppose not from a billionaire Adonis so my feelings MUST pale in comparison), but the 300 some orgasms she felt throughout the book were quite the overkill and definitely not believable.  Yet, like I said I read the entire thing unable to put it down. I found myself drawn to the story the same time I detested it. Eva, despite her marred sexual past, is what is wrong with women today and is the reason men think they can treat women the way they do.<br /><br />I initially chose this book because of the 50 craze, although I have no interest in reading that series ever due to my disdain for the Twilight series (I couldn't even finish all the books) and Stephenie Meyer's limited vocabulary, and many reviews have shared the author has the same issue of reusing the same words and phrases repeatedly, not to mention I have zero interest in a BDSM relationship or reading about one.<br /><br />Sadly, after all my negative views and feelings about both of the main characters, I will probably read the next book just to see what happens, although I just can't root for a supposed romantic relationship when it is just two needy people wanting to control and possess the other and never really exploring what else goes on inside an intense, serious relationship aside from sex. (And stalking to the point of creepy, on both their parts but mainly Gideon.) I also really would like to hear about Gideon's tortured past and Cary's, and I'm hoping they both get revealed in the next book. A guilty pleasure if you will, because I won't be going out shouting recommendations from the roof tops or proudly displaying this along with all of my favorite novels I own.
0061474355|4.0|A really unique fantasy world where the dead come to life and necromancy is a powerful form of magic. Very detailed descriptions; a real page turner.
0099579936|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey is an amazing Adult Read. I loved reading it so much I stayed up all night just to finish. It draws you into a world that not a lot of people are familiar with. I would definately recommend it to open-minded women who love romance! I have read all three in the trilogy and I am hoping for a fourth to come out!
0756407125|4.0|An amazing follow-up to Name of the Wind, I found this just a little long. However, I've talked to a lot of people who like this book even better than the first. While I disagree, I did thoroughly enjoy this book and can't wait for the 3rd!
B004EJUMT2|5.0|People too lazy to form their own opinions will say that they sound like Mercyful Fate and B.O.C. IMO, this band has more in common stylistically with America than with the 2 bands previously mentioned. Seriously, if America had been satanic, they would have sounded like this. This is a good thing. America were hook-masters and this album is full of awesome hooks. Another peculiarity about this band is their use of 16-beats, disco style, in some of the songs. It works though- and the guitar solos are top-notch, really adding to the songs instead of wankery. The vocal hooks will have you singing for weeks even though the lyrics are silly. This band is also extremely powerful live and will blow your mind if you ever get the chance to see them.
0756405890|5.0|This one made it onto my \\"favorite books of all time\\" list. Exciting, smart, funny and unpredictable, the first book from the Kingskiller Chronicles was easy to get into and hard to put down. I highly recommend this book for any fan of fantasy or historical fiction!
B00689ILQC|5.0|Honestly, this was too good of an album. I am seriously in love with it and play it every day!
0812550706|5.0|I don't know how I missed this book in High School, but I'm so glad I took the time to read it now. So smart and unpredictable. I felt like I was literally inside the main characters head. It was a really thrilling read.
B006GHA9VQ|1.0|It is not often I write a negative review, but this is one of those times.<br /><br />My wife and I are rabid fans of the Phantom of the Opera, and we were eagerly awaiting this video.  When it arrived, we made a nice meal, opened the good wine, and settled down to enjoy the show.  Within 15 minutes we had turned it off totally disgusted and disappointed.  This was not the quality we expect from the works of Andrew Lloyd Webber.  This video seemed more of a way for him to capitalize off the anniversary of the Phantom, not a quality work that could stand on its own.  Poor quality, poor story, and nothing but a vehicle to make a cheap buck.<br /><br />Do not waste your money on this item.  You can spend the money on birdseed and enjoy the show much better the cat will make as she watches the birds through the window as they feed.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|Amazing move equals amazing soundtrack.  The actors do an outstanding job singing rock hits of the 80s.  I don't understand all the bad reviews.  Those people don't understand good music.
B001PB3RU8|1.0|This is not a CD. It is not recognized as such. I tried to load this in my iTunes, but it didn't work. The disc is simply ejected from the computer. Funny that people who actually pay for the music are the ones that are limited from listening. I have no time to look for a solution to this problem, so to me it just doesn't work.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I had heard all the hoopla about the trilogy, and decided to read. I am glad I did. Anatasia and Christian are amazing! I did find the first chapters a tad slow,but once I got past that, I haven't be able to put it down. I'm on book 3 now. Trust me, well worth reading. Plus, who doesn't like a bit of \\"steamy\\" now and again?
B0088RQ4X4|1.0|I've read a lot of reviews where people say \\"I really wanted to like this movie\\".  Well, after hearing from everyone I know who watched it, I would not say I expected to like it, more like, I wanted to see if it had any redeeming qualities.  It did not.  Took me 4 nights to get thru half this dog.  I simply could not take it anymore and gave up.  The script, the acting, the director had to be deaf and blind, the editing.  I'll stop here and say: \\"If you think you're tough, see if you can sit thru this whole movie.  I give it one star because you can't do minus a star.  The apology should go to Mr. Burroughs.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game was okay but I thought you didn't have to buy the games at first. but then I figured out that you earn money playing the games and you use the money to buy other games I like this app.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|the game is very fun and kindle is an ideal platform. the extra room to draw is very nice. but there has been an android update out for quite awhile and the kindle version doesn't have it. I got the paid version on my phone and will play there since there is no support on kindle.
B007SGM084|5.0|Love Love Love it!!!  Touching, sensual, erotic and hot! A real page turner, has a little bit of everything for everyone that has ever been in a relationship.  Even though the two main characters are protraited as being \\"perfect specimens of the male and female\\" as far as looks and wealthy it reminds us all that no one is perfect.  Great read!!!
B004EPYZT4|5.0|Unlike the old movies, this Conan is the original Conan, like the character in Robert E. Howard's books.  Which, in my opinion, makes this a ten times better movie than the ones that went before.  And, even that aside, it's a good action movie.<br /><br />The action sequences were really well done--which is probably the most important thing for an action story.  They were visually interesting without resorting to fancy camera trick (like the Matrix).  And they didn't put in out of place Hong Kong martial arts.  I thought the first scene with Conan as a little boy was especially good.  I was really impressed with it.<br /><br />There's a little humor in it, which is always good.  It's mostly dark humor, but something to keep the movie from being totally grim is always appreciated.<br /><br />And, yes, there's not much dialogue.  But, that's a plus.  Conan is not a chatty character.  If there had been a lot of dialogue and 'character development' it wouldn't have been Conan, at least not Robert E. Howard's version.<br /><br />I think a lot of the negative reviews of this movie are totally unfair because they criticize the film for not being like the old Conan movies.  I think that's actually the movie's strong point.  The old Conan was Arnold Schwarzenegger in a loin cloth.  Conan, the real Conan from the books, was the original anti-hero.  He's the type who conquers and kills, just because he can, but is strangely likable anyway.  I think Jason Momoa pulled that off perfectly.<br /><br />I'll admit this film is not for everyone.  The fight scenes are very bloody, it's not clean cartoon violence like you see in superhero movies.  So the squeamish won't enjoy this one.<br /><br />At the same time the plot is very straight-forward revenge motive and there are a lot of bits that are directly from the books which were new back then but have been used repeatedly since.  It can seem unoriginal or cliche, if you don't consider the fact that this is going back to the originaltemplate that created the cliche.  In any case, there aren't any big surprises.<br /><br />My bottom-line is that there is finally an accurate and well produced version of the classic Conan stories.

B003O86FMW|5.0|As others have said, this book was great. I Couldn't put it down! I read all three books in five days my house loomed like a disaster zone, but the kids were happy and des and I was loving the book.

Personally I cant wait to see a football player run around with demon monkeys chasing him. Now that would be a show! ;)

B004MC8CA2|4.0|I've been using this app on my iPhone for a few years and I absolutely love it. Now I thoroughly enjoy reading on my Kindle.  It sinks w/ my phone and computer. The multiple versions and reading plans are great, and sometimes I like listening to the audio while reading. One feature I wish they would put back is history; when looking up various verses this allowed quick access rather than having to search. I must add that searching by book, chapter and verse is very easy. Overall, I love it and use it a lot. Thank you, YouVersion for a super app and to Amazon for making it available for free!
B004WOS3P4|5.0|I had this album pre-ordered, and I was so excited when it finally arrived. But I have to say, it was completely worth the wait. Not many musicians can make an album where every single song is great, but David Cook always manages to do that. This album is fantastic, with a variety of upbeat songs, such as \\"This is Not the Last Time,\\" \\"The Last Goodbye,\\" and \\"Circadian,\\" as well as the slow, heartfelt ballads, such as \\"Take Me As I Am,\\" \\"Goodbye to the Girl,\\" and \\"Fade Into Me.\\"<br /><br />What I love most about David is that, unlike most musicians today, he does not just throw random words together and call it a song. The lyrics to each of his songs are so incredibly moving, and they are so easy to relate to. Lyrically, melodically, and vocally, this is another stellar effort from David Cook, and I look forward to his upcoming albums!
B0062KJ198|1.0|30 Minutes or Less is the most lousy movie I have ever seen in my life.  The plot was overused (I have seen this same plot in Hollywood and TV movies dozens of times), the acting is horrible....the actors look like they are reading their lines off of a card, no emotion whatsoever, the actors have no chemistry with one another; it is almost as if they hate being together on the sets, and they can't wait until the scene is over.  There is a strained feel to the acting as if it is only a rough draft or first take, and they never went back and smoothed everything out.<br />  The producer of the movie claims that the \\"F\\" word is used in the movie 237 times.  To my ears, it sounded like much more than that.  For this reason, the movie has a very angry feel to it.  How can anyone in their right mind think this is comedy?  I guess very few young people today even know what a comedy is anymore, since it has been so long since Hollywood has had any true talent and imagination.  Good movies out of Hollywood are now few and far between.  Movies like this one really lower the standards of both Hollywood movies and society and morals at large.  What disgusting filth.

B003Y5H5C4|1.0|30 Minutes or Less is the most offensive and utterly stupid movie I have ever seen in my life.  To make up for the lack of talent, and the lack of chemistry among the actors, there are 237 occurrences of the \\"F\\" word in the movie.  This word is used so much, the entire film has a very angry feel to it.  Yet, it is supposed to be funny?<br />  This film is so horrible and offensive, it really should be rated X just for language alone.  It is amazing so many people think this was a great movie.  Just goes to show how low standards have gone in Hollywood and American society at large.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|Its really a pretty cool game but you have to buy crystals to purchase some things like faries also the items take so long to buy once you buy one thing a better one comes out. Another thing is the daily challenge usually helps with money but you need wireless to get it. Eventually I'll have to spend money though because the best stuff is like 300K no way I can get that. Still its a really cool game!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game was so addicting.  I could not put it down.  I loved it on I pod and ipad but I was so exited that it came out on kindle fire.

0316023744|3.0|Every single book ever published since the end of WWII till today has no TRUE perspective. 80% of every book covers american and UK (aka \\"allies\\") activities in pacific and north africa.<br />To take it all into the Right perspective, the real WWII wasn't going on in these far away  areas, but in Russia, where almost every single battle was THE Most important and decisive battles of WWII. The battles like Kursk, Stalingrad and many others made the turning points in the outcome of the WWII, not in the pacific, with small unimportant really events that had no special impact or influence on the outcome of WWII.<br />20,000 killed russian troops vs 400,000 killed american troops. So, here is the right perspective. Plus, not to get involved in the real War, in europe, until \\"dday\\" of june 6 1944...!!!!!  dday didn't have any impact on the war. Red Army was already on the approach to Berlin, and it was only a matter of time. The reason behind \\" dday\\" was to be part of the winning team.<br />every book published in US is filled with so much hype about americans in WWII, so much bravado, so much overblown proportions...and only about 10-15% of the pages usually toward the end, the \\"role\\" (ha..ha..ha..) of USSR in the WWII....Yes, true, this is how many books have names of chapters on this topic.  ALL are full with misinformation. WE \\"won\\" the WWII - this is a general message in all these books.
B0081KTI0E|3.0|Daniel was great, as usual, but after fighting the dark forces of the wizard world, this type of black hearted villain (The Woman in Black) doesn't measure up to \\"Harry's\\" standards.  The movie will keep your attention, for sure, but I would like to see Daniel in a different type of movie and in settings that don't include dark, massive, eerie places.  Not bad for his first movie after the Potter series though.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I cruise the amazon top 100 listings looking for new authors and interesting tales.

The author just picked up a publishing deal, so get this one now at it super low price.  FYI to the author, PLEASE continue writing and offering your works on amazon.  The only physical texts I have bought in the last year are all academic. Going forward, I may buy 1 physical book and 25 electronic books in a year.

The (example) story told in E Myth could be applied to any small business, and - Oh, what an eye opener E Myth was for me! E Myth showed me clearly in every paragraph where I had gone wrong in my business, and the solutions offered by E Myth were not too hard to correct. Sometimes I had to think \\"out of the box\\", just like E Myth suggested, but the beauty of it was that it really worked. The E Myth is a great teaching tool for running a well-oiled business process. I recommend E Myth as an absolute \\"must read\\" to anyone planning to set up a new business. E Myth is also a remedy for any existing small business with operational, organizational and productions problems.<br />E Myth is going to be my \\"business bible\\" for as long as I have my business.

1594630844|5.0|30 LESSONS FOR LIVING: TRIED AND TRUE ADVICE FROM THE WISEST AMERICANS (Hudson Street Press) by Karl Pillemer is a collection of ideas that the author, the leading gerontologist at Cornell University, has put together as a result of interviews with some one thousand of America's elderly.<br /><br />The result is a touching book with invaluable lessons about marriage, work and parenthood--among other topics.<br /><br />I really felt like I was listening to somebody who could well have been my mother or father, advising me to:<br /><br />* Never go to bed without saying \\"I love you.\\" I don't care if you have to grind your teeth and say, \\"I love you,\\" but you do it.

And it sounds silly and simple but it works. It doesn't pay to dwell on how much something hurts. If you pay attention to how much you have got going for you, that makes a great deal of difference. But basically what I have to do is will myself to think about all the great stuff that's going in my life, and there's a lot of it. I've come to be very much at peace with myself, and it's nice.<br /><br />And then there was this great tidbit on how to deal with worrying:<br /><br />* My mother was kind of a worrier, and I have it too. It comes with the territory, I guess. But I have learned to prepare, to prepare for everything I worry about. Whenever I give a speech or anything, I write it out. I sometimes play the piano in my church, and I practice until I can play it perfectly. It takes the worry away. It's the same with surgery I have that's coming up. I prepared for all the things about it- -I've talked to everybody about everything. I'm thinking I'm all set, you know? I'm in God's hands and I've got wonderful people that know their job. And I'm not going to worry, not going to waste time. If you want to maintain good health, spend your time planning instead.<br /><br />What a great idea!

B000FC1GJW|3.0|Find this at City of Books!<br />The 3rd His Dark Materials was entertaining but I felt like Philip Pullman dragged it out too long. I loved the mulefa and the Gallvespians who are creatures who debuted in this book. I wish the book was only told from Will and Lyra's POV not Mary or anyone else because that added so many different plotlines. As Usual Pullman's world was very interesting and creative. The plot was very detailed and interesting but it was tedious. I really wish I had a daemon which is a person's soul in the form of an animal companion. I felt that having a daemon would be really awesome because who wouldn't want to have an elephant or penguin following you around? Pullman really outdid himself with all the amazing world building and creatures but the plot and pacing are good!<br />If you liked the previous books in the trilogy you will probably like this book. I think that if the book was shorter and a little more fast paced I would have really liked it. Though The Amber Spyglass isn't the strongest book in His Dark Materials it is entertaining and wraps up the series nicely.<br />3 Stars<br />-Scott

0307951529|5.0|If you are planning to venture out on your own with the skills you learned as an employee, this is a great book. Even with an MBA, I learned more useful step-by-step templates for business problems than I ever knew before.<br /><br />If you are planning to be an entrepreneur, this is a solid guide for a teenager or college student to just get out there with an idea based on the intersection of their skills. All \\"value\\" comes from a unique set of skills that can be traded. Chris shows you how to make that happen in the modern era.<br /><br />I agree some of the criticisms are valid. It does have a newbie feel to it and there are some pieces missing from the stories.

B000J233SK|5.0|The best CD that I have heard in a long time.  Her voice and talent is amazing.  This is truly beautiful music. If anybody is wondering what a truly gifted singer and songwriter really is, then listen to this CD. Her gifts put all the rest to shame.
B007VTVGAQ|4.0|Let me preface this by saying that I am a huge Fiona Apple fan, and adore just about everything she has put out in the past. Also, note that I'm not a musician by any means.<br /><br />I find this album somewhat disappointing. All the other reviewers that have noted the under-produced feel of the album are definitely correct. The songs in this album are a substantial departure from the music that I love from Fiona. It's not really about tempo, Fiona has a bunch of songs like \\"Paper Bag,\\" and \\"Slow Like Honey\\" that are slow paced. Instead, I think that the songs in this album just feel like they lack the depth of sound that previous songs have had. It's difficult for me to put my finger on exactly why this is. The vocals are a bit less clear. However, I think the total lack of any bassy percussion is the biggest separating element. I think Fiona's music has always carried a distinct sound that includes some substantial bass. This is obvious in fast tempo songs like \\"As Fast As You Can,\\" and \\"Better Version of Me,\\" but is also prevalent in the aforementioned slower paced songs. As such, I have really enjoyed this sort of musical style, which was perfectly complemented by Fiona's vocals and lyrics. However, this new album does not have any semblance to that style (you might as well unplug you sub-woofer for some songs); and so, seeing as this isn't the Fiona Apple that I have come to love I have no choice but to be disappointed.<br /><br />Still, the album doesn't contain one bad song. In fact, they are all good (hence the 4 star rating). I particularly like \\"Every Single Night\\" and \\"Valentine.\\" Still, with Fiona Apple I'm used to thinking \\"perfect\\" and not just \\"good.\\"
B00846REIS|4.0|Just finished reading \\"Bared To You\\" and thought it was really good. Yes, it is kind of similar to \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" but not entirely. I read it for what it was without making the comparison that a lot people are. I'm looking forward for the next book in the series.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game its so cool its the best I love it. BEST GAME EVER. LOVE IT. love it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is fun but can use improvement. It keeps your mind going and helps you keep your mind healthy and active. thank you for making this game.
B0086700CM|4.0|this is a great free game. I only wish it had different levels to try because it can get old.
B007R41E8O|4.0|Thought the ending was a bit bizarre,but I enjoyed moving through this creepy (very mildly so) seek and find. Stayed up late to finish it!
B000OCZ0ZO|5.0|This LP collector's album is the first piece of a Linkin Park collection that I hope to continue to grow over the years.  This product was just as advertised and I'm very happy with my purchase!  Prompt shipping was also a plus!!!
B007V5CF5K|4.0|Enjoyed this mild seek and find, but using objects exclusively on the screen where you find them and the ample hints made it a little too easy.
B000JQU1VS|1.0|Yes, I agree that there is something wrong.  I could not finish the first story.  It just stopped and I can't go any farther.  Will you let us know when things are fixed?<br /><br />Thanks.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|I really enjoyed this game, lots of entertaining puzzles and a large world to explore, but eventually having to move around the world got old. There is a map feature showing how all of the individual screens connect, so it wouldn't be hard for the developers to add a teleport to that. Would have fixed the repetitiveness of moving around so much.
B008ASLK8A|1.0|I'm shocked that this movie was released due to the blatent plagerism committed.  This movie was a copy of the film The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.  Do people have the memory of a gold fish?  How do so few people not release if you pay to see this crap you've paid to see the same movie twice.  Both movies have the same story, plot, twist, character development, villian, setting and only the comic version of the LOFEG has Sherlock Holmes as the leader of the group.  For some reason the studio changed the lead to Quartermain from Sherlock.  However, both protaginists have the same fate at the end of both films.  Guy Ritchie should've stuck to indie flicks cause he obviously can't hack it in the major league.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|love the games it fun when you are traveling it keeps me and the kids entertain for the long trips

B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I am a hardcore fan of \\"The Walking Dead\\" since AMC brought it to cable television. I am well aware that this series is based off of a comic book collection which is also available on Amazon.com, but never having really been into comic books myself, this show was just what was needed to spark my interest. I have already ordered all of Season 1, pre-ordered this Season 2, and Season 3 will continue in October 2012 following a teaser weekend in July 2012 on AMC. This isn't a series just about zombies. There is alot of blood and realism to what life might be like if there were a zombie apocalypse, and the various cast members represent real life people in todays world. The makeup and effects can't be beat, and even with all the blood and the fear of zombies, this series actually has a storyline which makes the horror much easier to tolerate for people who don't watch horror/zombie flicks because of the surprise fear factor. This is a must see series!!!! Get ready for season 3, the \\"Walkers\\" are coming!!!
B0086700CM|1.0|if you jump it won't do it. you can't. beat even one level do not get this app i am warning you please don't.

B005FITIGO|1.0|While containing an interesting philosophical view of life this movie was too short on real facts/events and too long on foul language. The story of the financial collapse is very interesting and educational, this movie missed the opportunity to add to that.
B0086700CM|5.0|finally amazon gets temple run ive been waiting<br />this is a great game for free so get it.don't listen to all those haters.
B007M45PMU|5.0|Simple, yet brilliant songwriting. Strong (and extremely catchy) melodies run throughout this album, and the lyrics are creative and evocative, as well. The album tends to lose my attention in the last two or three songs, but this album is so strong right from the start that I really don't care that it fades a little toward the end. I feel like a lot of bands attempt this type of folk sound, but The Lumineers are one of the few who absolutely succeed; their sound is tight and coherent, but with plenty of space to wander and keep things varied and interesting within and between songs. This is one of my top two or three records of the year so far, and a favorite new band.
B0060AY85C|3.0|I feel that this novel is complete, yet incomplete. I'm sure that there is so much more to these characters that could have been explored. It seems sort of rushed. There is a beginning and an end, but the middle seems a little light. I think that the supporting characters could use more developing. Why is Salem such a push over? What happened between Frank and his homeboys that made them so close? Who were they as people? Prince comes across as a space filler. What did he really do to Cee that made him such a bad person? I wanted more detail on that relationship. Seemed like he got in the car dropped her off in Atl and drove away. It had to be more to it than that. Their parents have no voice, again the read like seat fillers. They were there to create the scene but had no real purpose. The doctor also, his character could have added such another level to the book if his story was developed more. I like the book, but it just feels too unfinished. I would give it a 3.5
B007UXT6T6|2.0|This movie is an assault on your senses. It's loud. It gives you no rest. It's just one impossible action stunt after another. I had to turn it off.
B005LAIGN2|3.0|This movie has great aerial combat scenes... However character development and acting are nowhere near as well done as in the 1995 HBO version \\"The Tuskegee Airmen.\\" That movie can be had for under $5 here on Amazon and is well worth the price to round out this unique and fascinating story of these heroic airmen.
0307593312|1.0|I am a huge fan of Murakami's earlier novels (Hard-Boiled Wonderland, Wind Up Bord Chronicles, Kafka on the Shore, etc). This is the only reason I have forced myself to finish this atrocity of a book. The \\"expert\\" reviewers are either getting bribes or smoking crack to give this book praise. Maybe Murakami has gotten too old, or maybe he has just run out of ideas and energy, but this book was horrible. Here is the breakdown.<br />Repetition: every few chapters  the same facts are repeated, using the exact same phrases, as if the reader just opened the book at a random page and needs to be brought up to date with the story.<br />Characters: Despite tedious descriptions of their thought process and feelings, I found it impossible to connect with any of the characters in the story.<br />The plot: It just meanders for 900 pages. It may get somewhat exciting for a couple of pages but then returns to the same tedious pointless details as before.<br />The sex scenes: so awkward and painful to read! And unnecessary. These were written worse than the garbage in romance novels.<br />The translation: What editor allowed this to happen!? The English translation is as wooden as the characters and the story. Even worse, there is a set of phrases which the translators used which do not sound right in an english sentence. And these phrases keep repeating, almost on every page, as if no one in the publisher's office had a thesaurus. I really miss Alfred Birnbaum (translator of Wild Sheep Chase).<br />Audio recording: I got the audiobook to listen to during the commute. The male reader is passable, but the female reader has no business recording an audiobook. Her English is perfect, but her intonations are completely incorrect. Every time I listen it takes me the first 15 minutes just to adjust to her reading.<br />Conclusion: Don't get this book! Don't read it, don't listen to it! Read Murakami's earlier novels instead - they are fantastic.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love how challenging this game can be. What I hate are all the ads. I like the option to customize it more to my taste and I like how easy it is to operate.
B000P5FH3K|5.0|It's one of my top three favorite John Grisham film adaptations, along with THE FIRM and RUNAWAY JURY, and never mind that, of these three, THE RAINMAKER offers the least in the pure adrenalin department. That's not to say that there aren't edge-of-your-seat moments. But, no, Matt Damon's character doesn't get to scramble around, evading bodily harm from them ominous henchmen. But the shady big bad, he who represents that daunting, amoral corporation, that cat's here and played to oily, cunning perfection by Jon Voight.<br /><br />Rudy Baylor (Damon) is a rookie lawyer fresh out of Memphis State U, and his idealism burns incandescently. But while his more well-off, well-connected fellow graduates are headed for prestigious law firms, Rudy's prospects are dim. For the past three years he's made ends meet by tending bar at the local sleazy watering hole, and it's there that he makes his own connections. Rudy's voice-over narration informs us of his plight. \\"There are too many lawyers in Memphis,\\" he rails. \\"This city is infested with them.\\"<br /><br />It's at the bar that he meets \\"Bruiser\\" Stone (Mickey Rourke), an extremely disreputable lawyer. With no better options, Rudy accepts an offer to work for his firm. \\"There's nothing more embarassing than working for a guy named Bruiser Stone,\\" Rudy muses. \\"I mean, he's a lawyer and they call him 'Bruiser.' That's how desperate I am.\\" Rudy is introduced to Deck Shifflet (Danny DeVito), a \\"para-lawyer\\" who specializes in relentless ambulance chasing. DeVito approaches his meaty role with relish. He plays Deck as a shifty operator but, damn, if he doesn't make him endearing. Deck may have flunked the bar exam six times running, but his real-world savvy and natural sneakiness soon render him indispensable to Rudy.<br /><br />Rudy learns that his job with Bruiser's isn't a salaried position, that he's expected to generate his own cases and his own fees. I don't know how hands-on Grisham ever got with regards to the scuzzy underbelly of lawyering, but, oboy, it's fascinating to watch his characters here, inhabiting the gutters and back alleys of the legal field. Rudy's lofty idealism is eroding faster than his boss' credibility, and it's only exarcebated when Bruiser's operations come under intense FBI scrutiny. One blink, and Bruiser Stone has gone on the lam.<br /><br />Deck's feral instincts convince Rudy it's time that they scamper and establish their own low-rent legal practice. They're hanging their hat on a high-profile insurance case in which a legitimate claim was wrongfully denied. In kicking sand in the face of the giant insurance company, Great Benefit, Rudy finds himself challenging Leo F. Drummond (Voight), Great Benefit's silky smooth lawyer and Memphis' biggest legal shark. Rudy Baylor, needless to say, is ridiculously outgunned. It's what makes this movie so much fun.<br /><br />Grisham introduces two sub-plots, one involving Rudy's relationship with a sweet old lady who becomes his landlady. I wished the film had included the scenes in the book in which Rudy goes out of his way to evade the yard chores he'd promised to do for the old lady as part of his rental obligation.<br /><br />Rudy, in the course of his ambulance chasing, enters into a tentative romance with a battered young wife (Claire Danes), and I won't lie that it's frustrating that it takes forever for Claire Danes' character to dump her abusive husband. What eventually unfolds sinks Rudy even deeper into murky legal waters.<br /><br />To help evoke that old-time atmosphere, a host of people constantly puff away at their cigarettes. I guess there's nothing like a cloud of tobacco smoke to lend to verisimilitude. The jazz score itself, thick and sweet like molasses, fine-tunes that ambiance. I found THE RAINMAKER to be massively entertaining. It's Francis Ford Coppola at the helm, and so right away there's credibility attached. The film profits from rich and textured storytelling, from several powerhouse performances (and a parade of small character turns from Danny Glover, Dean Stockwell, Roy Scheider, and Virginia Madsen), and from a clear rooting sentiment for the underdog. That last bit isn't anything new for a Grisham thriller. The \\"Underdog Lawyer vs. Dodgy Corporate Conglomerate\\" theme is practically the house specialty on the Grisham menu. But it never gets old when the little guy turns the table on them smug villains. Rudy and Deck find themselves subjected to underhanded shenanigans by the Great Benefit legal team, and the big fun then lies in cheering Rudy and Deck on as they, in a succession of crowd-pleasing moments, reverse their sticky situation. In retrospect, because it's that kind of movie, and because this is a John Grisham story, those big-time legal sharks never stood a chance. Watching Matt Damon's earnest character pull it off, all I can do is quote his old landlady: \\"Not bad for a yard boy.\\"<br /><br />This is the Special Collector's Edition. As such, here are the included bonus stuff:<br /><br />- Watch THE RAINMAKER with Francis Ford Coppola!! - He introduces the film (00:04:20 minutes long)<br />- Audio Commentary with Francis Ford Coppola and Danny DeVito<br />- Francis Ford Coppola directs John Grisham's THE RAINMAKER (00:27:04 minutes)<br />- 4 Deleted Scenes - includes Extended Beginning and Alternate Ending<br />- THE RAINMAKER Screen Tests: Matt Damon (00:03:17 minutes), Claire Danes (00:01:37 minutes), Mary Kay Place (00:02:05), and Virginia Madsen (00:01:34)ormances (and a parade of small character turns from Danny Glover, Dean Stockwell, Roy Scheider, and Virginia Madsen), and from a clear rooting sentiment for the underdog.

0553801473|3.0|I started reading the books at the beginning of the HBO series, second season.  After finishing the first 4 books (obsessed part), I started wondering how in the world this tale could have some resolution.  I started book 5 and quickly discovered the big weakness in reading the ebook... you can't throw it across the room when you get pissed off!!<br /><br />I mean, seriously.... a whole chapter cut and paste from a previous book?  And from there bits and pieces throughout that are more direct c&p.  It is very disappointing.  Almost as if the author had no plans for the wrap up of the tale, but had to finish his contract with one more book that everyone is waiting for, so sales will be big and who cares if the fans don't like it, they'll buy it anyway.<br /><br />I guess I'll not go so far as to say \\"don't bother\\", but be prepared to be disappointed.  There are a few moments of shock and awe (that's why I gave 3 stars instead of two).  But if you are looking for a wrap up or logical ending, be prepared to write your own version, because it is not in the book.  Maybe we should start a website for fans to finish the loose ends?
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|I thought this movie was incredible. Robert Downey Jr is just excellent as Sherlock Holmes and the chemistry between him and Jude Law is extraordinary.  I loved the slow mo scenes (woods, etc) and of course the future confrontation predictions Holmes is so well know for.<br />My favorite part was the actual ending...did not see that coming...even my two children (11 & 10 yr old boys) loved how it ended.  I hope they make a 3rd.  I have watched this movie over 5 times already and will watch it over and over again.  I can't say enough good things about the sequel.  Great job to Robert Downey Jr, Jude Law and Guy Ritchie for his direction.
B000UJ48O0|3.0|I was very excited when the OC series went on sale and so I immediately bought it. I have been watching the seasons in a row and I am on Disc 10. Every disc so far has had at least one episode that it skipped almost the whole way through. I take the disc out to see if it has scratches or needs to be cleaned but I see nothing. I still clean the discs and yet they still skip. I absolutely love this series but am so disappointed with these discs.

B007L3BMGA|5.0|I loved the 50 Shades of Grey trilogy.  It was extremely erotic, quite frightening at times, not well written, but definitely a fun read.  I was desperate to read all three books to find the reason for Christian's behavior, and to see what became of both Christian and Anastasia. I loved the ending! Sometimes it is just nice to not have to think too deeply about the plot of a book.  50 Shades was pure entertainment.

B00127RAJY|5.0|Jillian is a tough instructor, however this workout is structured so you can find your level of comfort. There are 3 levels and each level has a modified and an advanced, so potential to have 6 different workouts. I am a 52 year old woman so some of the jumping is difficult on my knees and back but still pushing through.  Haven't been doing it for 30 days yet so still don't know exact amount of weight loss. Right now I am at 6-lbs for two weeks (only using level one modified version). Enjoy the DVD very much glad I purchased.

1401235417|5.0|I was unsure how the Batman narrative would unfold after the release of the new 52, but I can say these first seven issues of Batman are top notch.  The story revolves around Batman uncovering a mystery in the same manner that he would in other Batman stories, such as The Long Halloween and Hush.  However, this story differs in its development of the background of the mysterious enemy.  If you enjoyed The Long Halloween and Hush, you will love this one!  The only downside, was that there happened to be four pages out of order.  My guess it was a printing/publishing error.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This game is very addicting!!  I can play this game for hours!  I highly recommend it for people that like pattern games.
B0072GPQ72|5.0|Another great film by Spielberg. Anybody who loves horses and enjoys movies set during the war of WW1 should enjoy this flick. Beside the usual fine direction of Spielberg the movie wastes no time showing how difficult it was during WW1. A great must see with an unusual opportunity of seeing the war from a horses perspective.
B0051YKV4A|5.0|This dvd to me personally is the best in the Unplugged series well this one & Nirvanas . The late great Layne Staley in top form despite the fact that it was rumored that minutes before taking the stage did a big dose of heroin .and it shows at one point during the show as he stumbles thru one of the songs and just asks the audience \\" whats my motovaion here \\" . Nonetheless a great performance in all .a must if your a big Alice in Chains fan. Its quite chilling to view this as Layne still sends chills up my spine to this day when I watch it .
B005FITIDC|5.0|As a person from a developing country, I can empathize with the painful struggle in many parts of Africa. The shedding of innocent blood because of greed is corrupting this world. But there are people like Sam Childers who stand up and fight. People like him stand for honor and dignity of the innocents. That is why, I believe there's still hope and reconciliation for everyone irrespective of caste, creed, religion or race.<br />My one and only humble advice is for everyone to watch this movie.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Once I started reading Fifty Shades of Grey, I couldn't put it down.  It is a very tender love story about 2 individuals with very different backgrounds who come to know one another, share their feelings and love eachother.  The story draws you and in and makes you feel the emotions of the characters in the book.  It would be great to have another book to read because there is some much more to this story! I LOVED it!!!

B0038JN6VA|1.0|Received my \\"Happy Capsule Speaker\\" about 20 minutes ago and was anxious to try it out.  Since I was already on my laptop I plugged it in and accessed my I-tunes.  Well there was no sound.  It probably needs to be charged....so I plugged in the USB cable provided.  No lights went on that were explained in the manual, which I carefully read before using.  Long story short this little thing is just an attractive paper weight.  I have not yet determined if I will ask for a refund or try a replacement.  Very frustrating.[[ASIN:B0038JN6VA X-mini Happy Capsule Speaker with 230 Hz - 20 kHz Frequency Response]]<br /><br />Well I was not given the option of exchanging the item and had to take a refund.  I was considering ordering another one but now the item is $10 more than I paid for the it a couple of days ago. I know it is a nice little speaker when it works, but I don't think it is worth $50.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|I've just completed all 5 books available in this series, and while I have thoroughly enjoyed them, by book 5 I was expecting some conclusions to at least some of the story lines. There have been none. These tales, told in terms of character points of view, seem to go on forever. The style is very unique and constantly leaves you wanting more, but after book 5, I don't see an end in sight. I think George RR Martin has written himself into a hole and instead of leading the story, he's become a victim of his own format. Even with two more books promised, I fear it is going to be a challenge to arrive at END to this series; or rather any end that will justify the having read 7 books! To this point (book 5), the lead up has been incredible and if Martin doesn't leave the reader with a great ending, it will all seem to have been a waste of time for the readers. Given the format of having so many stories written from the different points of view, this would have been better served in a comic book format to let the story trickle out and provide an opportunity for conclusions to certain story lines. Reading these books has been like a build up of a potentially great circus act: As it stands, Martin has so many plates spinning and has now lit a ring of fire that I'm expecting an equally great grand finale. I hope he can deliver or I'm going to be pissed. Maybe the fact that HBO has committed to a TV series on this has contractually committed Martin to an outstanding ending.
B007P6VM4A|4.0|At 46, I am a bit of a classic rock fan. It isn't that I hate new music, it is simply that there are so few artists that I feel safe purchasing the entire album. So often, there is one really catchy song, and a LOT of dreadful filler. While I can't put these guys on the same footing as The Clash, they do have a similar energy. I will now be delving into this band's back catalog. Start to finish, this album has fantastic energy.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I bought a pair of Sony MDR-7506 headphones about two months ago and it's hard to say enough good about them. I'm not one to write online reviews in general or \\"gush\\" over something new... but I just had to take the time to add to the positive comments for this exceptional product.<br /><br />I've had a pair of Sony MDR-V6's for many years which I was always very happy with. Along with general music listening they were often used with a Kurzweil digital synth. My rationale in deciding on the V6 was that the additional frequency response would be a good match for the digital keyboard which might actually take advantage of the additional range (particularly in the bass). I was quite satisfied with them although, as has been noted elsewhere and consistently, the foam did lose it's \\"skin\\" before very long and there has been nothing but the bare foam left on mine for years. Otherwise I don't think headphones \\"wear out\\" per se, but my V6's really were \\"high miles\\" by this point and the bare foam wasn't the most comfortable thing (kinda scratchy although yes, easily replaced.) So I decided to retire my V6's to back-up duty after almost two decades of faithful service.<br /><br />I sifted through the various debates here and elsewhere about the V6's vs. the 7506's and decided to go with the 7506's this time around. After all... I already had the V6's (and still had them) so why not give the 7506's a go? So it was as much for that reason as opposed to any particular review one way or the other that I opted for the 7506's this time. And I just love these things. Every bit as much as the V6's they replaced and frankly even more so. I know some will say \\"Yeah, the 7506's are almost as good as my $300 xxx brand phones\\" but I tell ya. For the money (and even not), you simply can't go wrong with these headphones. I use these with a good sound card on my computer (an Emu 1212) and the result is simply magical.<br /><br />Mark my words: if you use these headphones AND start to replace some of your favorite music with the latest \\"remastered\\" versions... be prepared to hear things you haven't heard before! And I say that unequivocally, no matter if you've been listening to those same \\"favorites\\" for 30 years. I could provide countless examples of exactly that, but it would really only be meaningful if you had the 7506's and those same remasters to refer to (and I assume you're reading this review because you're still on the fence as far as what headphones to buy.) I've played in cover bands for years with headphones being the tool of choice to transcribe music so I'm not exactly a casual listener. These headphones + latest remasters = wow!<br /><br />I like the 7506's better than the V6's, and they aren't even \\"broke in\\" yet. But it's a close call and I don't think one would go wrong either way. I was enticed by the extra frequency range of the V6's for the reasons stated above and I'm sure many have made their choice between the two on exactly that, thinking more is always better. But in my opinion, the V6's might be slightly more fatiguing with extended use for perhaps that same reason. And I haven't experienced that at all with the 7506's in similar use. The V6's extend range is slightly beyond what we would normally \\"use\\" and I think that's exaclty what becomes slightly fatiguing over time. And by extended use I mean maybe 4+ hours listening at a time. If you're programming synths or something you might prefer the V6's, but for general musical purposes and extended listening I think the 7506's are a better choice. I wasn't sold on the coiled cord at first because it feels a bit more \\"weighty\\" but it's ok as I find I almost never need to extend it and kinda like the compactness of it.<br /><br />Some pro audio reviews here have stated that almost everyone in the field uses 7506's and now I can see why. Sony hit upon \\"magic\\" when they developed the formula for the 7506 and it's surely for good reason they haven't been changed or discontinued in all that time. My advice is to just pony up and order the Beyerdynamic EDT 250 replacement velour pads from the get-go like I did, very comfy and much more substantial, you won't regret it. And pay no mind to those that say they're \\"impossible\\" to install. If you can't easily swap these out in five minutes you probably shouldn't be around electrical devices. ~Linux0s

030758836X|4.0|This is a tricky book to review, because I don't want to provide spoilers.  Forgive me for being unclear in many ways, but to be concrete would give away too much.<br /><br />I found myself enjoying this book quite a bit - yes, even the ending (I know many are rolling their eyes at me right about now).  I loved the distinct voices of the characters, and the twists were wonderful.  Just when I thought I knew a certain character, there would be something that I would find out about that particular individual which would change how I felt about the character.  That happened with different characters several times.<br /><br />What I came away from this book is that relationships (especially long term relationships) are complex, because there are two complex individuals involved in that relationship.  I've always felt that we can never totally know another person, becuase we don't have the ability to know their every thought.  In Girl Gone, we grow to know the two primary characters over time, much like in a growing relationship.  There are things we like about the characters, and things we hate.<br /><br />Much has been made about the brevity of the ending.  At first, I admit, I was a bit irritated.  But then I kept thinking about it, and can't see any other way it could have ended.  That shock, like many of the other revelations in the book, seemed to fit perfectly.  For the author to have written more about what happens at the end would have taken away from what happens.  We know the characters really well at this point, and it just seems like exactly what the characters would do in the given situation.  Do I like the choices made by the characters?  No, but the choices definitely fit with the way the characters evolved over the course of the book.  Characters made poor/horrific choices thoughout, and to expect a certain character to suddenly become a decent human being and to use good judgement is unrealistic.  I also think that we are meant to ponder the long term consequences on our own... and I have, and oh, it's horrible.<br /><br />Give Girl Gone a chance.  Stick with it, and enjoy the twisted ride.onsequences on our own... and I have, and oh, it's horrible.<br /><br />Give Girl Gone a chance.  Stick with it, and enjoy the twisted ride.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|One word to describe this album: Incredible.  Stop reading these reviews now and just buy the CD. Lifeson, Lee and Peart are the composers of our age. It is not hyperbole to state they have given humanity the gift of thoughtful, rich and inspiring music.  \\"Clockwork Angels\\" is another musical achievement for RUSH.
B0068THAGY|5.0|Super 8 has a terrific premise with themes you'll recognize and may be tempted to label as borrowed - but done in a 100% original way.<br /><br />Coming of age characters reminiscent of The Sandlot, Stand by Me, and The Wonder Years - I grew up with kids just like these. Nostalgic and real without being juvenile.<br /><br />A story about the military and an alien that is every bit as enjoyable as Close Encounters and ET.<br /><br />Wild-ride action a-la Indiana Jones and The Goonies.<br /><br />No cursing and a less-is-more approach to the gore - think Jaws, Star Wars, and Independence Day.<br /><br />The great 70's sets, haircuts, and costumes - Loved the convenience store and similar details.<br /><br />That fantastic Abrams humor - shows up in everything he does. The boy-banter is so dead accurate, I laughed out loud more than once. I'll watch it again just to catch everything they say - I did the same with Star Trek.<br /><br />The techno-heavy scenes are well done - they add to the movie without detracting from the feeling of watching a 70's story.<br /><br />Bottom line - This movie is for those who want to be entertained for entertainment's sake. The overall effect far outweighs any flaws. Alone, with a friend, a date, or your kids - it's just plain good.
B007M45PMU|5.0|This album just gets better and better the more you listen. Stubborn Love and Dead Sea are my favorites, but Ho Hey makes me what to dance and cry at the same time! Seeing them on Monday and I can only bet that the live show will exceed the album.
B00007GZQZ|5.0|this is about a house that everything goes wrong.  tom hanks and shelly long have to rebuild the whole house.  you name it they fix it in the house.  yeah they bought the house cheap but spent more in the long run.  just watch this it is funny.

B00006FDCD|5.0|this is about a clown that only kids can see and he kills the kids or try's to kill them.  go ahead about 25 years and when they are adults they try to kill the beast because they failed when they were kids.  the beast comes around about every 25 yrs about.  shows the kids / adults there fears.  At the end of the movie they finally kill the monster.  this is a great.

B00785P2QC|4.0|this game is fun...I enjoy....lots to keep you busy.  Dont like that they want you to post to f/b in order to earn building points....or that they expect you to shell out more real money to BUY more building points in order to play.....makes it less FUN!
0062213423|5.0|I love this book! I would read it over and over again! If you are a directioner than I would definitely get this book! A MUST HAVE!
B0011UJMK2|2.0|I bought this because I enjoy nonfiction on this era in Russian history, and felt like reading a novel for a change. The book is as simple and contrived as a bad television serial. The story could take place in any setting with relatively few changes. The writing isn't good enough to make up for the plot, which careens stupidly from one hackneyed twist to another. Like many other mass market paperbacks, the book does nothing for your brain. That's fine of course, but the critical acclaim and litany of five star reviews on amazon fooled me into thinking otherwise.
1466401885|4.0|Decent little read.  I like the bad boy approach in this book, but the fights seem a little like Fight Club.  Travis character seemed a little over the top, but I can see where he needed to be considering Abby was so stubborn about their relationship.  I'll be looking for a sequel.
B000QJLQY4|5.0|An excelent book, better than I thought. I receive it in perfect conditions bad it took more than expected, about a month and a half.

B007P6VLRS|4.0|The buzz around \\"Oceania,\\" (2012) The Smashing Pumpkins ninth album is that it's Corgan's best work in years and is the album that fans of the 90s-era SP would love. Personally speaking, I liked all of the band's work and absolutely loved \\"Zeitgeist,\\" (2007) despite its mixed reviews and fan response. Still, the idea of Corgan, as the cliche goes, \\"returning to his roots\\" to make an album in the style of \\"Siamese Dream\\" (1993) sounded intriguing.<br /><br />When I sat down to listen to \\"Oceania\\" I was expecting to hear something that would sound like \\"Gish\\" or SD, but that's not what I heard. I don't mean that as a criticism of the new album, which is excellent. It's just that I feel that comparisons to the band's earlier work have been over-stated a bit. To me, \\"Oceania\\" sounds like Billy and comp. are picking up right where they left off with the still-in-progress, synth-laden, epic \\"Teargarden By Kaleidyscope\\" (2009+).<br /><br />One major difference between \\"Teargarden\\" and \\"Oceania\\" is that the latter just plain sounds better. While I liked the ten songs so-far released from \\"Teargarden,\\" they sound under-developed, more like demos than actual completed songs. The songs on \\"Oceania\\" sound much more full and fleshed-out. The fact that Billy has a new band that is road-tested and behind him, sure helps ( Jeff Schroeder--guitars, Nicole Florentino--bass, Mike Byrne--drums). While some may still complain that this is not the original band, Billy has found a group of very talented players that have helped him reach the sound that he is looking for.<br /><br />Track-by-Track<br /><br />Quasar--A good opener, reminds me a little of \\"Cherub Rock,\\" the opening song from \\"Siamese Dream.\\"<br /><br />Panopticon--The riff here is quite unusual and hard to describe--it's almost hypnotic. The lush background vocals work very nicely here.<br /><br />The Celestials--This really sounds like a continuation of where Billy was going on the \\"Teargarden\\" project. This one sounds sparse, yet also full and is quite elegant.<br /><br />Violet Rays--Has an almost prog-rock intro and the song has kind of a Pink Floyd-ish feel. This one probably wouldn't be a contender to use as a single, but it's cool.<br /><br />My Love is Winter--A really well-written, pretty song that still manages to rock. Sounds like a cross between the \\"Teargarden\\" and \\"Siamese Dream\\" eras. There is a lot going on in its lush production that one might miss in just one listen.<br /><br />One Diamond, One Heart--This one's synth heavy and definitely sounds like Billy's more recent work. It's one of the album's slower tracks but not at all boring.<br /><br />Pinwheels--An instant favorite of mine. This one takes a lot of twists and turns. It starts out almost sounding like The Who and then treads acoustic ground, with beautiful background vocals brought in. The almost George Harrison-like soloing works great.<br /><br />Oceania--An epic, rather ambitious track. This reminds me a little of \\"United States\\" from \\"Zeitgeist,\\" although this one's a little more laid back.<br /><br />Pale Horse--Here we see Billy contemplative yet yearning in this haunting melody.<br /><br />The Chimera--The album picks up the pace a bit here. Not bad, but not that memorable either, one of the weaker tracks on the album.<br /><br />Glissandra--Sort of middle-of-the road SP, but its' cool and entrancing riff makes this song work.<br /><br />Inkless--Not bad but didn't do a lot for me either. Sounds like a \\"Teargarden\\" throwaway.<br /><br />Wildflower--Makes for an excellent closer. Somewhat haunting, it starts out rather subtle and builds up before climaxing in a sea of synths and distorted guitars, while remaining subdued.<br /><br />Despite a little filler during the last quarter of the album, \\"Oceania\\" is a fine collection of songs. If you like what you hear on \\"Oceania,\\" make sure to download (for free) the \\"Teargarden\\" tracks from the band's official website. \\"Oceania\\" is actually supposed to be part of the \\"Teargarden\\" project, \\"an album within an album\\" so it will be interesting to see where the band go from here.t of the \\"Teargarden\\" project, \\"an album within an album\\" so it will be interesting to see where the band go from here.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Ugh.  I heard nothing but \\"read this\\" from friends so I did and wow it just did not do it for me.  How in the world does a fan fiction of Twilight get published and then an movie deal--(I have no idea how on earth Hollywood will make this movie with a normal rating either).  I got real bored real quick with the virgin Ana blushing, biting her lip, and saying 'he's so freaking hot' in her head on every page.  Seriously?!  Painful is one word to describe this novel.
B007VTVGAQ|3.0|I am a Fiona Apple fan. I like this album. The problem is, when you make people wait 7 years for an album, i's better be well crafted. I am not into that under-produced trend. It is just an excuse for labels which does not want to spend studio money anymore.<br /><br />Fiona is great, her lyrics,her presence are great and the songs... could be greater if arranged differently, with more production. It is just the path I did not want her to dig after Extraordinary Machine. You can feel it is going this way in the previous LP, I just did not want her to. But she did. Watching the video of Every Single Night did not help at all. She is better than this. Love the lyrics, love the songs potential but, it'sjust not crafted wel lenough for me. Love her though. Always.
B00845PV16|4.0|Awesome action. Works for me. Enjoyed the show. Downloaded to my Fire-take everywhere with my favorite movies. rent and decide. Or if you like action just buy it!
1401216676|5.0|While there is no \\"official\\" backstory for the Clown Prince of Crime, this is widely regarded as the unofficial official backstory by many fans, and for good reason. The Art is superb, the writing excellent, and the story itself is wonderfully wicked and deliciously devilish. A must have for any fan of Batman.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I like this game a lot! Some of the words are beyond me, and some beyond the younger crowd that plays.. and watch out for people using this to just draw dirty things!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This entire triology was simply addictive, from page one of the first book- I had to force myself to put it down and go to sleep each night.  Although, if I was forced to pick a favorite- it was Fifty Freed (the third one).<br /><br />I quickly looked past the physical/sexual piece and became engaged by the characters and the twisted storylines.  And, since I've finished, I've found myself going back and reading favorite passages.  I miss Christian and Anastasia.<br /><br />I have little free time, so a book must keep my attention and this series definitely accomplished that and more.
1400064287|5.0|This book is the best I have read at teaching you how to say something so it can be remembered.  It doesn't matter how great the information is that you have, if when you tell others, they will not remember it.  It is a must read for anyone serious about business, marketing, advertising, management, and just being an effective communicator.  The authors bring very unique and valuable perspectives to this book, and it delivers everything and more that it claims to!
B0052VUNHC|4.0|If you are looking for an easy summer love story read- this is an excellent choice!  The characters are descriptive and you learn to love each of them for their strengths and hidden secrets.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I love this game and I just can't say enough a out it!<br /><br />the story line is exciting and I couldn't wait to proceed to see how it turns out.<br /><br />This game has hidden object games of several kinds.  there is the usual list but with a twist. you only start with a list of 5 and as you find an object a new item is added to the list until you finish.  there is the white shape of the object to find, also with only 5 showing at a time.  there is also a 'find all' type where you find all of a type of object, such as tools.  it tells you how many to find in each, and how many you found.<br /><br />there are various kinds of minigames between scenes but you can skip them if you want.<br /><br />finally each scene has some ? marks and tapping that gives you an extra hint.  the graphics are great too.<br /><br />I read reviews complaining about having to use facebook to play this game.  NOT TRUE.  You can select facebook but I didn't.  When you finish a chapter it does say 'congratulations' and 'tap here'.  If you tap the picture you will go to facebook.  But if you wait 3-5 seconds the screen changes to continue, and you go on with the game.<br /><br />I only played the relaxed version.  I am going to play again using the classic version.<br /><br />as you can see i highly recommend this, it is well worth the $5.<br /><br />warning - highly addictive.  I couldn't stop till I finished.  it took me about 6 hours over two days.<br /><br />the end of the game says a sequel is coming.  please G5, issue it soon!
1401235417|5.0|Scott Snyder is the light at the end of a dark tunnel of Batman writers. The Court of Owls starts the new run of Batman books off at a high standard, playing with everything from the very mannor in which a comic book is formatted to the way we perceive Bruce Wayne as a character, a nuance too often forgone by Batman writers. I cannot recommend this book highly enough.
B007JWKLMO|5.0|Very well done.  Excellent and tasteful. Gives a great idea of the mindset of George Harrison through the years. Recommended highly to any Beatles fan.

0451197968|4.0|This is almost like a science fiction fusion of 24 and The Fugitive. Awesomely paced, nails the dystopian future, (though as it was written in 82 King doesn't foresee us having cell phones which leads to scenes taking place in a phone booth), and has a rather satisfying ending. I'll spare you a synopsis as I am low on time and believe you, my beloved reader, to have the mental aptitude to read the back cover on your own.<br /><br />According to other reviews, DO NOT READ THE FORWARD, IT GIVES AWAY THE ENDING. I read this in The Bachman Book collection, and therefore did not have this problem. King is the king of suspense and horror fiction (pun not intended, just spilled out) and I look forward to reading all of his books in chronological order.
B007Q0OUNA|5.0|Ok, this set is just awesome. First the characters: Frodo, Aragorn, Merry, and the Ringwraiths. A fantastic cast of characters that adds considerably to the entire Lord of the Rings LEGO series. Plus, the Ringwraiths ride on the new LEGO horses, which are beautifully designed specifically for the wraiths. These new horses have the ability to stand in a rearing position, which is a very welcome improvement. Frodo comes with the One Ring, and the sword Sting. The set itself is fantastic, a unique spiraled staircase, secret chamber inside, weapons racks, trap door, bolt-firing mechanism, campfire, and intricate details throughout, including little statues. I can't say anything bad about it!
1612130283|5.0|I try not to get caught up reading 'bestsellers', but after listening to friends and neighbors rave about this book, I finally broke down and read it...and loved it.  Alot (big sigh).
B007I2BZIE|5.0|This album is a MUSt for any music collection.  Complex for sure, yet simple, this album was written ingeniously lyrically and musically.  Kudos to producer Nick Raskulinecz for once again pushing Alex, Geddy, and Neil beyond themselves musically.  For the first time since 1978's \\"Hemispheres\\" the album was written as a concept, same as \\"2112\\", and \\"Caress of Steel\\"  It except for one album side telling a story in one song, this is 12 stand alone songs chronically telling the story of a young man's life journey through a Jules Vern style nostalgic setting.  I don't want to repeat other reviews and writer's description telling the story.  The album is non-stop and up-beat, slowing only during the end song \\"The Garden\\", which, if you sit and read the lyrics and follow the story as the album plays, this song will definately touch you to heart, even making you cry..maybe. It is the most remarkable and indescrible ending to a story or an album. It is just a brilliant perfect song, for it's meaning and the way it brings the story to a close.  \\"Caravan\\" \\"BU2B\\" \\"Headlong Flight\\" \\"The Anarchist\\" \\"Clockwork Angles\\" and \\"Seven Cities of Gold\\" are definately power houses at their best.  \\"Halo Effect\\" \\"Wish Them Well\\" and \\"The Garden\\" are well toned songs unlike anything these guys have ever done before.  Brilliant and clever, entertaining and even moving.  It's a must have and definately something the long time Rush fan's can relate to.  For the simple minded person, simply put and elementarily it is a story about a young man's hope in life and in all people though his life has only seen people to be deceitful, hateful, and even dangerous.<br />I think the most difficult challenge the guys have with this album is WHAT to play during the tour, without playing the entire album.  Perhaps six songs will be picked as was what they did with \\"Snakes and Arrows\\"  Every song on this album is worthy of a live performance.  PERSONALLY speaking, since \\"Caravan\\" and \\"BU2B\\" got previewed onthe \\"Time Machine\\" tour, not to downplay these songs as they are highlights of the album. To do this entire recording justice live, skip those two in concert this time and go with all new material.  I'd love to see \\"Headlong Flight\\", \\"Clockwork Angles\\" \\"Seven Cities of Gold\\" \\"Halo Effect\\" \\"Wish Them Well\\" and \\"The Garden\\" performed live on this go.<br />Just a note: Alex was interviewed by Billboard.com and quoted as saying Rush will be brining a string ensemble on tour to reproduce the sound of the alubm live.  The ensemble may also play some of the classics as well!  What will these guys do next?
0307346617|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read.  The oral history format is incredible and makes the book so realistic.  Brooks created, not only places and situations but a multitude of characters and so vividly described what each of his characters experienced that the entire story felt like it was happening as I read the book.  The realism is created through his prose which is so vivid and effective that it felt like something that could happen or already did happen. I had to keep reminding myself that it wasn't real.  It was overhwelming, emotional, entertaining and as I have said repeatedly - extremely real.<br /><br />I am still haunted by North Korea.

Covers every cliche of the worst and most formulaic romance novels: her eyes are too big for her face, her hair is too thick and unruly, she touches him and feels an electric current run through her body... Puh-leeze!

B005LAIGPU|5.0|The what we know as the 'found footage' genre has been around for a while, most memorably Blair Witch Project, which is probably the grandfather of the genre. What BLP started Oren Peli cashed in on with the Paranormal Activity movies. Now in a sea of found footage Chronicle comes out of left field. Its the story of a somewhat loner in high school whose life is forever changed when him and his friends find supernatural abilities. The rather young cast does a delightful job of portraying what would happen if any of us were in a similar situation. The direction is great, with very little Cloverfield-ess nausea inducing movies. It's an interesting take on a superhero origin story.

1451629184|4.0|Jaycee lived in a nightmare no one would ever imagine anyone surviving, emotionally or physically. Explaining her life in hell and having to re-live it while writing this book is the makings of a very strong woman. Just the fact that she kept hope afloat has made her an example for young and old alike.  Her ability to process thoughts and even have the personal assertiveness to teach herself how to function in so many areas while being alone is remarkable. She was her own educator and became a mother when she had no mentor. She is an amazing  woman and although I am shocked she survived this ordeal with sanity, she is a great example of faith and hope to many who seem to have lost hope.  Prayers and love to Jaycee.

B006M4RN3U|3.0|Having heard the two knock out pieces on this album and having heard many good things about Ruess's previous album Aim and Ignite, I bought this album looking for more. Upon my listen, the only two tracks that ended up standing out were the reason why Ruess was propelled into mainstream pop. The other pieces, although creative, were not very memorable. They began to sound the same and blended together into one tone, in my mind. Also, we must discuss the use of auto-tune. Ruess's beautiful and unique voice is marred by the unsightly use of auto-tune.  At parts where I hear it, smudging the intonnations all smooth like, I cannot stop but cringe. The track \\"It Gets Better\\" sounded like something the Jonas Brothers could have come up with.  Stars was a great song already without auto-tune, yet he decides to use it there as well. I know some will defend it as a creative choice- that it's not used because he needs to fix his voice, it just sounds more poppy?- but auto-tune only cheapens the music and makes it disposable- like the hundreds of atrociously produced pop songs of the decade.<br /><br />Summary: The music was good, but compared to his previous albums, this sounded like a pop cop-out with repetitive sounds and auto-tune. I hope he does not sell himself out in the future.

B005LAIH3G|5.0|I first learned of John Carter from the Comic Books back in the 70's then later in the mid 80's I was privileged enough to read the original series from... now get this...... the original books published so long ago from a friend of the family who was a collector.<br /><br />I am as guilty as anyone of using Kindle for my books now but I have to say those old books the way they smelled the tactile sensation of holding those old beloved treasures really does something to make you remember a story and hold it precious in your memory.<br /><br />Now here we are all these years later in 2012 can you believe it and our technology has advanced to the point where they can properly make a movie of one of my all time favorite characters. Yes they did change elements of the story but not to the point where they have harmed the original in any way that matters. In fact they may very well have improved on it. It has been many years I will have to read the stories again.<br /><br />I just watched this in3D with my wife at home and we both wound up clapping like little kids at the finish the same as we did in the theatre in 2D the first time around. If this does not say how we feel about this movie nothing ever will.<br /><br />I never go to 3D movies in the theatre because the quality of the the theaters equipment around our area is so poor.<br /><br />I do buy 3D movies on Blue Ray here on Amazon though because they are so good on our home equipment.<br /><br />Lol I use a PS3 as my 3d Blue ray player the latest slim models are dead quiet and with the PS3 remote are better players than many dedicated players. Ahemm hello Samsung 3d blue ray player junk.... that was a bundled item to buy my T.V.<br /><br />Anyway the movie is very well done not one character is poorly portrayed and if you have a history of reading the books or comics don't worry this will not let you down.
