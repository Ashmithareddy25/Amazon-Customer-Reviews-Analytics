B007J4T2G8|5.0|I didn't even finish the book because school and work had me so busy but it was a very good price and I was satisfied with it! I love that I can't buy books for my iPad directly!
B000W237RE|5.0|Sorry, but this is a truly historic album that gets better every year. Living, breathing, organic music. Get the extended remastered Live at the Fillmore first, this is almost as good. Duane Allman and Berry Oakley were real visionaries, I absolutely love this stuff.
B0033H7VI6|4.0|Knife is great only thing is the case could be a little better. I would recommend to anyone to buy, especially for the price.
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|I think this is a fun game. It is challenging, interesting and it has excellent graphics. I highly recommend this download.

B0094BB4TW|5.0|Only each person on Facebook has the ability to choose your own realm of friends in which to remain in contact with! I have mainly entered the Facebook world to stay in touch with my own family and have found many more relatives and friends,  which I enjoy hearing from. It is free to everyone! No long distant phone calls or snail mail to have to purchase stamps to send letters to. If the person is on that you want to chat with, you can do that for as long as you wish. If they are not on, you can send a personal message to that person and only that person receives the message. Oh! On the chat line, no one else sees the message that you instantly are chatting with. Very private messaging for either way! It is not a social media for only the young people, the older people like me enjoy this way of socilization, as well! It is a free way of communication! Can be time-consuming and addicting, because it is so neat to interact with your Facebook friends.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|On one hand, I'm still not comfortable with the release of the details of the assault on the Bin Laden compound, but as Owens correctly points out, many of the details were released prior to his writing of the book, and he felt the need to correct inaccuracies, and address for historical perspective, that which has been used for political expediency. I cannot imagine that anyone with his level of training and commitment to his brothers and sisters in arms, would ever release information that would negatively impact top secret operations of the US military and intelligence forces. This was a likely (and hopefully) one of the most historically significant operations of our lifetime. He takes you along with him on a surreal roller coaster ride through real life operations. Reinforced my awe of, and respect for those who bravely represent the US in our most elite military forces. Fascinating story!

B004NJW96C|5.0|Once again, the great great grandson of Herman Melville outdid himself.  This is a great CD to listen to when relaxing whether it be on a beach, in the bathtub or simply lying in bed.

B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I have read the many reviews by many people and agree with virtually all of them.  This show has it all.  The cast is perfectly matched to their roles and the chemistry makes you want to tune in and not MISS anything-especially the two leads.  This is the perfect romance/mystery novel come to life.  Finally characters I envision in the perfect book!  I ordered the first season and plan to order the rest.  I have recorded many shows on my DVR and sometimes when nothing is on TV I want to watch I enjoy watching the reruns and fast forwarding through the commercials.  Castle and Beckett are exceptional and the show is my favorite!!!

B006O5YHUY|5.0|This movie has all of the emotional punch of a \\"Rocky\\" film but with an entirely different storyline. The actors are amazing; and I could empathize with each of their characters. Kleenex tissues are recommended for this film if you're the emotional type.<br /><br />FYI: I tuned in to see Tom Hardy, whom I had never seen or heard of until \\"This Means War,\\" which I found to be extremely funny; I think it got bad reviews b/c it's really a CHICK FLICK that was passed off as being Bond-esque.  In researching Tom, \\"Warrior\\", kept coming up in reviews as a great movie and earned Nick Nolte an Oscar nom. Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy were extremely convincing in character, but Tom has this incredible intensity like Russell Crowe in \\"Gladiator.\\"  I am not opposed to violence in film or TV where it is appropriate; however, I do object to people labeling CONTACT sports movies as being violent when getting hit is the whole point of the sport.

B009LXEBD4|5.0|I don't usually like pop music, but I love Kelly Clarkson!  This album has most of my favorite songs by her and I absolutely love Catch My Breath!  I debated buying an album mostly of songs that I already have, but I'm glad it did!
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|One of the best allmaround series I've ever seen. Charactors come alive and stay true all thru, very good writing.
0374214913|5.0|One of my favorite books of the year!<br /><br />Robin Sloan combines wit, mystery and the now. This is hard science fiction in the tradition of the best of Clarke and Asimov and even a little Crichton. He dances just enough on the edge of ridiculous to keep things moving, and manages to bring the whole thing home with a terrific ending.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I love this cd.  An excellent cd from an amazing singer.  I think much better than her earlier stuff.<br />ch
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is tons of fun for everyone. some games are difficult but they are all tons of fun! works great. click the ? for instructions.
B002ZG99NG|5.0|I was hoping for more on the supplement angle and picture quality for being a Sony title (and part of a known franchise now) but this will have to do.<br /><br />The story follows an elite mechanic/hitman as he weaves through deception and retribution while mentoring the son (played excellently by Foster) of his former friend and boss (Sutherland). Foster was the reason I watched this and have been a fan of his since 11:14; itself an overlooked but good film. Above all of the usual Statham faces, inept bad guys, great stunts and token eye candy, Foster actually carries this film for me and proves himself again.<br /><br />The picture quality was average at times, with a great deal of exteriors having that grainy look, but other times the clarity was above par. The DTS is as expected from Sony and it rocks nicely with the various explosions and gunfights. I was disappointed with the lack of extras, but they include:
B00973DDN2|5.0|I downloaded this album to keep me occupied during a road trip and it really did the trick!  I love The Killers and they never disappoint!
B008GXHOFW|3.0|This app is a lot of fun but the controls sometimes glitch just when you need them most, the graphics are pretty good but you have to be up close to the object in order for the graphics to be amazing.  I played it a lot the first day but after charging it at night I could not open the app no matter what so I was forced to unistall it. Overall it is a fun game but I bought it for 99 cents I wouldn't pay 7 bucks though.

B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This was a great movie, for the color, the storyline, the actors and action. Everyone will enjoy this movie. it is great in HD wish I could have seen it at the theatre. 3D would have been outstanding!
B003S897UK|4.0|...that could have been classic. This is a fantastic band and the guests at this concert make excellent contributions, particularly Little Milton whose vocals sound wonderful on his 5 tracks on this 3 CD live set . What lets this set down is some muddy sound on certain tracks (and particularly where the vocals are back in the mix as in 'Blind Man in the Dark' and 'Is It My Body'). That said the combination of originals and covers (and most of the covers are great) by this heavy blues trio makes for pretty essential listening- not a classic but definitely recommended.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|An amazing ending to a excellent series of movies. We got all the older movies out to watch the day before viewing this which made it even better! Now that the Avengers are together maybe we will have some more amazing movies!

B00979CS50|2.0|I am of the opinion that NY alone is better than NY&CH, the quality of sound for example has always been worse, and there is something in that constant loud glam-rock sounding guitar gives me a headache. One person had written that NY,  has always been hit and miss,totally agree and other than early 90's, NY&CH bn more miss. It is not ReActor, but it ain't Harvest neither, and then again nothing is.

B0041KVW2K|5.0|I think I have bought every version of The Beatles albums in every format over the past forty years.....Capitol has always done a very cool job of reinventing the catalog.  This is no exception....its great to have the stereo albums all assembled, and in a great box with a book.  Keep em rollin' EMI, we want more!!!
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Loved the book and the movie. Great overall though there were things about the book that obviously didn't translate as well in the movie either because of casting or time. Certainly something even adults will enjoy if they look at the actual story of how these teens are in this situation rather than their interactions with the people around them and each other.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|If you love your vinyl, and are looking for an upgrade, then this is all you need. Seems worth the price to me...i like the nice sturdy box that this set is housed in with the nice fliptop feature, making it easy to access whatever album you want to play. It also includes a fantastic Hard Cover book with info about each album, and how they were remastered..and crammed full of beautiful vivid high gloss pictures...that will entertain you for a little while!! Each lp is pressed on high quality heavy 180g vinyl and includes replicas of the original \\"parlophone\\", \\"capital\\", \\"apple\\" labels...to me they sound wonderful..i do have to say that while i was listening to the \\"white album\\" and \\"abbey road\\", i remember of my original vinyls sounding somewhat crisper and clearer than these new remastered ones....and also, the remastered cd's also seem to sound clearer....don't get me wrong, they don't sound bad, but i was expecting better. The covers for these albums are good and bad...the good is that the \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" album includes a pull out spread with a nice picture of the band in their uniforms, and inside is all the information about the songs...the \\"Yellow Submarine\\" album is the the same thing, a pull out sheet with all the original liner notes...and finally, the \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" has the original booklet but is not attatched to the inside of the gatefold like the original album is..however, the paper quality seems better so i'm sure it will hold together better than the original copies...the only bad thing about the covers is that they seem somewhat flimsy and cheap...when i ordered this set, i was expecting cover replicas too...like the high gloss laminated and the fold on the back..like the original 60's issues. I think that would have made this set more enjoyable for me...so aside from the gatefold albums, i kept the cellophane wrap on all the single album covers because i think they could wear out pretty quick. I gave this a 5 star review because it's the Beatles! I'm glad i purchased this because my collection wouldn't be complete without it...it's a great way to have their whole collection in one package, and new at that! Oh it sounds pretty good...there are some minor imperfections along the way, but it is what it is...nice set overall. If you want my honest opinion, buy it...you really won't be disappointed.

B00A6PD9I4|2.0|The title pretty much says it tall. Characters are all exceptionally cliched archetypes, paper-thin and 100% predictable. Not a single laugh-out-loud moment. Overall, a very formulaic effort.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am addicted to Pinterest so having this app on my phone is wonderful. I have issues with it only occasionally but not enough to keep me from being on it all the time.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The book was very well written, but the characters such totally unlikeable people that it was hard for be to even read the book..borderline and antisocial personalities to the max!!
B001GCUNYO|5.0|estoy completamente satisfecho con el item lo recomiendo la pelicula e muy buena y mantiene al espectador alerta y ansioso por lo que suceder&aacute;
B008KE3960|5.0|This is a great 'tower defense' type game. Love the in-game options.<br /><br />There is just enough repetition to make it easy to learn but enough variety and challenge to keep me at it for hours!
B0086700CM|5.0|I had it on my ipad so when I got it for my kindle fire I almost had a spaz attack. It never lags and I keep running out of battery.
B004R13U6Y|1.0|Found much better programs for free, the voice on this program that reads the pdf is worse than windows reader and adobe is a much better opening pdfs or using kindle.  I wish i had never wasted my money.  As a student and business owner i would not recommend to anyone
B004FP1WX0|4.0|This film works best if you don't know the story going in, but even if you do, it's still fascinating viewing.  I was hooked from the first frame to the last.  If you are at all into social websites, Catfish is a must see.  There is some controversy as to whether this film is a true documentary or somewhat scripted.  I don't know, but I do know that the complex range of emotions it exposes in its subjects and the like emotions it produces in the viewer are all very real.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I rate this with five stars because it is very chalenging but very easy to play. It does get very difficult but fun.
B0034G4P7Q|5.0|I was hoping for more on the supplement angle and picture quality for being a Sony title (and part of a known franchise now) but this will have to do.<br /><br />The story follows an elite mechanic/hitman as he weaves through deception and retribution while mentoring the son (played excellently by Foster) of his former friend and boss (Sutherland). Foster was the reason I watched this and have been a fan of his since 11:14; itself an overlooked but good film. Above all of the usual Statham faces, inept bad guys, great stunts and token eye candy, Foster actually carries this film for me and proves himself again.<br /><br />The picture quality was average at times, with a great deal of exteriors having that grainy look, but other times the clarity was above par. The DTS is as expected from Sony and it rocks nicely with the various explosions and gunfights. I was disappointed with the lack of extras, but they include:
B005HSL626|5.0|This is super fun I love it. I love fruit so this makes me wanta eat more fruit. It is the best app EVER.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Loved this book.  A new character with whom most can instantly find an attraction to.  Puller is huge, built like a tank, seemingly invincible, but at the root of it is a man with deep feelings who has the training to protect people, including those he comes to care for.  Yet, he would never admit he were perfect.  He doesn't think he is.  In fact, he's a perfectionist who is never happy with his actions.  Even saving people from nearly dying is cutting it too close--as if it was partially his fault they were in harm's way to start with.<br /><br />Puller's a complex character, who unlike other fictional characters who come away unscathed, he gets himself hurt in the process.<br /><br />Recommended read if you're looking for an easy-flowing novel that mixes police procedural and heroic bravery with global implications.  My only small note would be there is a lot of military \\"education\\" in the book, but that's a personal preference.  It's obvious Baldacci did his research with this book which shines through in the small details giving it credibility.<br /><br />The Forgotten, the next in the series, is high on my to-read list.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app! You shoud make a hunger games one! But this  is the greatest app to get! :)
B00AA7O22U|5.0|Hilarious, if you have seen their older movies.  Fun time!  Might have to buy this one.  Can't believe such a violent movie can be that funny
B009E3EXMU|5.0|People who will like the CD's are those who have long loved live Zeppelin and the sound in the old bootlegs.  They are the soundtrack to the DVD.  Those who will enjoy the DVD's are those who would want to see Led Zeppelin in concert.<br /><br />But if you are going to enjoy it, enjoy it you will.<br /><br />That sound...That power...That force...<br /><br />It appears that over the 27 years since their last concert before an audience, that a pressure built up inside of the Zeppelin members that they themselves didn't notice.  It came out in a 2+ hour unrestrained explosion.  The magnitude can only be felt, heard, and recovered from, then repeated.<br /><br />They kept it simple (no long solos on \\"Stairway to Heaven\\", no twenty-five minute majesty of \\"No Quarter\\"), but that didn't remove the majesty of anything, in this 16 song live set.  If there were mistakes, it just sounded like the live Zeppelin of old.  Their music was always honest.<br /><br />John Paul Jones' name came first in the credits.  For reasons I will not rehash, I considered this appropriate and in good taste.  The only way to describe the performance of Jonsey is \\"professionally seamless\\".  As perfect as anything can be.  And it was good to see him not camera shy for a change, being face to face with Page up front most of the time.  We can't imagine the fun they must have been having.<br /><br />Robert Plant frightened me.  He has to sing in a lower key now, but the deterioration of his vocal power was a myth in my mind.  He never lost the power of that voice, it just took it awhile to wake up after 27 years.  He sounded almost as good as the first show of a seventies tour at times.  And for those wanting a tour, he could never keep that up night after night.  He couldn't in Zeppelin's prime!<br /><br />Jimmy Page...(well...)  He wasn't as nimble as the seventies, and his guitar sound was a little too dirty, but he was still thrilling and convincing.  Obviously the man in charge on the stage.  Itmakes me wonder what alcohol and drug infused collection of voters came up with that Rolling Stone best guitarist list.<br /><br />That sound...That force... I have to say Jason Bonham was a little drowned out.  Maybe they should have miked the drums better.  But he could be heard.  And no-one...I mean no-one...could have honored John Bonham with a performance better than this man gave.  He has become a magnificent drummer.  But there is no living drummer who can hit the drums as hard as his old man did.<br /><br />Editors do not see things from the viewer's point of view.  Expect that the longest you will see any given shot is about a second.  This is the DVD's biggest fault.<br /><br />But despite any drawbacks, ...That Sound...That Power...That Force.<br /><br />If you have the right speakers and don't worry about tinkering with sound, and still have sound problems you are doing something wrong.  Yet there are many sound options for the true audiophile to experiment with.<br /><br />There is the DVD with the concert, and a DVD with the typical \\"extras\\".  I think they could have done a lot more with the extras disk.  Just some old news footage, and a rehearsal just before the real show where they ran through the set list.  It was not filmed for viewing purposes.  It was something recorded from a distance, probably to get a feel for last minute fixes.  I would describe it as the best sounding bootleg of them all.  But it must be heard to see the difference between Zeppelin having the presence of an audience, and not.<br /><br />The set list in order:  Good Times Bad Times, Ramble On, Black Dog, In My Time Of Dying, For Your Life, Trampled Under Foot, Nobody's Fault But Mine, No Quarter, Since I've Been Loving You, Dazed And Confused, Stairway To Heaven, The Song Remains The Same,  Misty Mountain Hop, Kashmir, Whole Lotta Love, Rock And Roll.<br /><br />To say \\"beyond expectations\\" is too much of an understatement.  And after reading this, you will expect a lot.  You will get it.

B008Z9YGEE|4.0|I was unsure if I wanted to see this movie because of the disturbing and gruesome premise, but it was well directed with good acting, lending itself to the PG13 rating. It was worth watching.
B000683VI4|4.0|I have a special collection of VCR tapes and wanted to update to DVD's. This was my first DVD purchase and I couldn't be happier. The audio and picture were both great. I enjoy purchasing my DVD's online especially when there is a sale.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I have had this book recommended to me several times, but I never seriously considered it. I do not consider myself a sci-fi reader. I picked it up, because several of my freshmen students were assigned the book as part of their English course. I wanted to be able to converse about it with them, and they seemed to actually enjoy what they were reading for once.<br /><br />The book moves fast, and I didn't want to put it down. I wanted to know how Ender would approach each new challenge. I learned plenty about military strategies and tactics, but I also learned about humanity- especially how we treat intelligent children. Pushing them harder and farther than previously imagined.
1567184855|5.0|The book *does* cover the journey of a soul from the time of birth to death to rebirth, but I wouldn't say it's really about a &#34;life&#34; between lives, but rather what goes on between lives.<br /><br />I think the book is awesome because you hear very little about what happens after death and I'd always assumed that people hook up with some loved ones or old friends, hang out for a while, ponder their last life, then come back and do it again. But according to the thousands of people hypnotized by Dr. Newton it's far more organized and structured than that. This is like Intelligent Design for agnostics and gnostics. There *is* a Creator somewhere but it is more of a background source and force. The planning, evaluating and encouragement comes from other souls just like you and me (although much more advanced to have gotten into such a position.)<br /><br />If you feel like you came here for a reason, but don't know what it is, have suspected there's more to life than the physical but couldn't buy into the biblical narrative and aren't necessarily into the whole new-age scene, then you should read this book for a perspective that is enlightening, mind-blowing and overall empowering.
B008GXHOFW|2.0|I loved this game. for the first hour or two. it would deserve five stars,  except whenever I try to open it now it closes itself down. I have done everything including reinstalling it.

B009VB97EY|1.0|I couldn't even finish it!  Save your money!  Even the hot guys didn't save it!!  Awful, awful, awful, awful, awful!
B000GCFY0I|5.0|What I love most about this series is Westerfeld's voice through his characters. The characters are different than those written by women and it shows in many of the personalities. For example, while most books in this genre have in depth detail about the way the girl feels while a boy is holding her hand, Tally seemed to have a stereotypical males take on the world. She wasn't giddy while daydreaming about her next kiss. She was more about action packed scheming and uncovering the truth, and she used her relationships to further her own agenda. I love this personality in a heroine as its quite refreshing.
B005XN31LY|5.0|what an excellent show. so entertaining, it keeps you wanting to see the next episode. such a different concept in television shows.
1439152802|5.0|Added this book to my short list of favorites for this year. This is my first Kate Morton book and I look forward to reading her other novels. I really felt connected with the characters which to me is the making of a great author. There were many twists and turns and the ending far exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend this book!
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|For the price of watching it online you can't beat it. You can watch it as many times in 48 hours as you want.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|The seiries is still kicking butt after three seasons.  I have always been a huge fan of the Zombie genre and this series has consistently gone way above expectations.  LOVE IT!
B002NVTSGQ|5.0|&#34;The Incident&#34; episode makes it all worth it.  Nets out the horror stories around divorce that rip families apart.  Ouch.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|some of the games are impossible to beat. you can win free coins and buy coins. Its really good that they try to give you a lot of ways to win coins.
B001NESPHC|1.0|Ordered CD instead of download since I wanted to play in my car.  CD was not &#34;recognized&#34; by any of my CD players and therefore useless.  Unfortunately, music CDs cannot be returned so I wasted the money.  Will stick to downloads and burn my own CDs from now on.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I wanted to read this book to see what all the hype was about. It is not very well written, and it repeats a lot of the same exact conversations and sex scenes over and over again.  And there are way too many sex scenes.  These people did it like 5 times a day! However, I did finish the book and have read the others too, because I wanted to see what happened in the end. So, I guess it is interesting enough, but I don't think I would read another book by this author.
B009CPES4I|4.0|The acting and story line was very good, although it was a little too predictable. It is worth spending a couple of hours on.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|You can't go wrong with a Wes Anderson movie and Moonrise Kingdom doesn't disappoint. Bill Murray could have had a bigger role, bit it's a great movie nonetheless.
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|Rihanna fan , have all of her albums and I downloaded it first to get a feel of the album then went to the store and bought it .... Love it
B0095R76EW|1.0|The is the worst movie my family have seen in a long time. I thought I got a lot older watching this movie-- it seemed like 5 years...........
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great show, great ideas, great acting, we anticipate ever new episode eagerly and are very pleased that we can easily purchase them on Amazon Instant Watch. Bam.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|awesome game until it crashes opening menus times also reset this game has great potential if they would fix it.
B007H7XJD4|4.0|Immortals:  Action packed.  I liked it.<br />Great effects.  I have always liked movies from that period of time with a little fantasy included.
B009YX02T8|5.0|This is my favorite of all the Twilight soundtracks, consisting mostly of slow, haunting, and emotional melodies that put me right back into the movie again.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|A wonderful and delightful summertime film. Filled with the innocence of youth, the quirks and flaws of adults, the feel of summer camp with drama and heart. Not to be missed.
0439023521|5.0|This book is really dark with the  reaping of teenage children for the Hunger Games. Young Katniss really has to balance survival against her humanity. At the end her humanity triumphs but this puts her and her family and friends in danger of punishment by the Capitol. After reading this book, it leaves you anxious to read the other books in this series. I have also seen the movie and am looking forward to seeing the films made of the two other books in the series but although the movie was good, the book was much better.
B003L77GRO|5.0|This is the best season so far!!! I plan to buy season 6 next.  Love Dexter and don't want to give anything away!!!
B002WNC5BU|5.0|This documentary was very fun to watch. The only downside is that The Edge was the representative of the 1980's.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|it is fun but the real money required to get everything is much too expensive. progress from just playing the game is slow.
B007L6VR6M|5.0|This movie is hilarious, and, if you like Wes Anderson, you will love it.  I'd rank this with Rushmore and Fantastic Mr. Fox as his best.  Great performances by everyone, but the kids steal the show, especially Jared Gilman.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|The book was good for a murder mystery, kept the pace well. I do wish I had read it before getting hooked on watching the tv series of Castle.  I didn't care for the names of the characters, as it made it hard to keep my focus on the reading instead of thinking how it resembled an episode on tv. Not sure if I would recommend Nikki Heat books to read but I may later read a Derick Storm to see if it captures my interest.
0439023491|5.0|This is the second book in the Hunger Games Book and continues the story of Katniss and Peeta. The story is very dark but also very interesting. It builds up to an interesting climax with some interesting twists leaving you waiting for the last week of this series.
B005NNV044|5.0|I first heard the song Fearless on Pandora and was stunned that I had never heard this Pink Floyd song! The album is amazing, showing the band at a very young but very challenging age. They were pushing the limits a very young age.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|It's not that I expected the movie to be bad, quite the contrary.  I thought it would be lovely and entertaining.  I thought it would be colorful and well-done.  I simply was not prepared for how truly wonderful and moving the experience was - and I don't say things like that about cartoons.  Evah.  It was inspiring and touching and funny and poignant and more.  I don't care who you are, just go ahead and watch the movie.  You'll like it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Head over heels about this book. The only part im still not to sure about is the whole ghost thing. But other than that it is one of the best books I have read so far. I cant wait to see the movie.
B0090X4GLW|4.0|Pretty much what you heard in the movie--great acapella music.  There are a couple differences from the movie, most notably in &#34;No Diggity&#34; from the Riff-Off.  Still, really good.
B007TK77QE|4.0|Having a toddler myself I found this book tugged at my heart strings.  I did enjoy the book thoroughly however it left me feeling rather sad and I needed to read something upbeat to cheer myself up.
0439023513|5.0|This book which is the conclusion of the Hunger Games series. There are many twists and turns in the book and the book ends on a sad note. However, the Epilogue of the book holds some hope of a brighter future.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I chose this movie because it was good in the movie theater! Great for the whole family!<br />A must get movie for the holidays!
B003KUSUNG|5.0|I am very pleased that I decided to buy the video of the whole concert. Back in 1990, I taped only the Robert Plant segment. Obviously, I missed out on viewing many other great acts.
B000FVE3AC|5.0|The first surprise was the huge impressive box and the second that it was an automatic. I have the white face with yellow didgets and I have had nothing but compliments when wearing it. My friend spent over a $1000 in a Seconda and cannot believe the value and looks this watch has! At the price I should have bought more than one!
B008OOYALE|5.0|AWESOME, WOULD LIKE MORE PERSONAL INTERACTION W/DRAGONS. LOWER COSTS OF EXPANSION, CLEARING, TIME BUILDING HABITATS, HARVESTING :-) CLEARING, BE ABLE TO CHANGE NAMES.
B007KZY1YY|5.0|Like millions the world over who can go wrong with Mr Grey?  This page turner was one of books I could not put down this year. Of course I recommend it!
141659521X|2.0|Vince Flynn's latest novel is almost a let-down compared to his previous works.  Poor editing, along with an almost cheesy plot have almost ruined this bool for me.  I am an avid Flynn reader, and I will purchase his next book, but I was very disappointed.  In the past every novel has been for the most part grounded, and took you from A to B to C.  I think there are some missing parts in this one.  My biggest issue is with the concussion and memory loss part.  I am no stranger to combat or the head trauma that goes along with it. I don't think its realistic that the main character goes from complete amnesia, to partial recovery, to business as usual within a day or so.<br /><br />It almost seems like the author rushed through this book.  I hope this in an aberration and not the beginnings of a trend.
B009NPKTN6|2.0|Disappointing for such a great cast and music.  Appeared to be a parody but wasn't.  The story was predictable other than the unexpected relationship that the bar owners ended up in at the end.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|I have been a Led Zeppelin fan since I was in elementary school. I love everything about this band! Nothing more to say!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This version gives you access to numerous Bible versions along with reading plans and other information. It's easy to navigate and works better than a lot of the other Bible apps I've tried.
B00A3YTC6Q|3.0|Get with netflix before they go under and have them teach you how to stream a movie over the internet.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I have read every book and I love this one not as much as some but do love this one!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Great Mommy - daughter movie!  Loved how it portrayed the daughter's journey to realizing that Mom was pretty great afterall.  Also loved how Mom realized that sometimes you have to bend a little.
B0087ZG7FC|5.0|Blu ray movie is fine except the digital copy download code, it wasn't  for scarface but for the mummy.that was bad
B004W1GCQO|5.0|This is an awesome show. I watched all episodes in one sitting. Can't wait to watch Season II. If you like Downton Abbey you will like this too!
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|I enjoyed it.  It was very entertaining. I'll watch it again when my grandson comes from Va.<br />Word Word Word
B008EQIEWS|4.0|We enjoyed the first one (Clash of the Titans) better, but the Wrath of the Titans was still good.  My teenage boys (13 and 15 yrs old) thought it was great fun.
B007MU85D0|5.0|Reminds me of a mellower Florence & the Machine sound. I have only had it for two days, but I have fallen asleep to it each night. Very relaxing music with interesting lyrics that make my imagination wander.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|A nice user friendly app for pictures. Great extras. started with the free and then bought the app because I liked it so much.
0812993292|2.0|Harold and his wife are one-dimensional characters who have somehow managed to reach old age without acquiring a bit of wisdom, depth or spirituality.  We are to believe that instead of mailing a letter in the nearest post box, Harold decides to walk across England to Scotland to deliver it personally, leaving his wife without explanation or a way to contact him as he ditches his cell phone at the outset of the journey.  His pilgrimage is ludicrous and many of the people he meets along the way are even more cartoonish than he is.<br /><br />The sentences are sometimes as simple as those in a children's book.  The pilgrimage is not very entertaining.  The beginning and middle are terrible, but the end is best despite the author having cheated us by withholding a key piece of information.  Why she didn't trust the reader with it I don't know; it wasn't hard to figure out and its disclosure wasn't an ah-hah, it was an oh-please.  Worse, it detracted from the parts of the end dealing with the letter's recipient, which I found rather touching despite the fact that it, like the rest of this book, was wholly unbelievable.
145210655X|1.0|Go read iharthdarth: [...]    It is much cuter, cleverer, and pre-dates this by 7 years.  I don't know if the author of the webcomic can sue this guy for plagiarism, but I think he should try.  I would much rather have i harth darth in book form.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|dont buy it . you have to restart every  time you off and on.it stinks.when you are in sneak mode it is hard to get off it
0316228532|3.0|I'm not sure what I was expecting when I picked up this book but I did find that she relies too much on two very strong themes that she focused on heavily in the later Harry Potter books. It is possible to write a good, moving story that isn't focused on death and teen angst, however she leans very heavily on these devices. The messages about the world we see and the lives that are actually behind them are strong, which is why I'm plowing through to the end, but it drags. It almost feels like she is trying to beat us over the head with the grit of life and death.<br /><br />Edit: I have finished the book. For those who find it dull to begin with, it does get more exciting. Rowling does what she does best, building to a strange, unexpected climax. Without giving away too much of the ending, we find out the results of a selfish society that waves away the problems of the poor and focuses on their own foolish nonsense.<br /><br />My initial opinion of the book still stands. She relies too much on the 'shocker' tactics she used in the Harry Potter series. Death plays a huge role as a beginning and an end, side characters that you learn to sympathize with become monsters in their own rights, a hero is found from an unlikely source.<br /><br />Overall, I'm not sure I would read it again. At least, not the whole thing. It's dark, gritty, painful at times to read because of the torture inflicted on the characters. I kept wondering if this is the extreme that Rowling would have gone to had Harry Potter been written 100% for an adult audience. It's definitely not for someone looking for something light and pretty, most certainly not for children.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|We have been watching this movie since VHS tape.  Then we switched to DVD, now this will be the first Christmas we watch it in Blu-Ray.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|Cute campy movie.  I used to love the Dark Shadows series when I was a kid.  This didn't really live up to my expectations.  But it had it's moments.  I would recommend it to Tim Burton and Johnny Depp fans who are looking for something light and gothic.  I would not recommend it to those who remember the Dark Shadows series fondly.
B000ICXQOM|5.0|I love this movie, it was just as good as I remember it being! The bad special effects are fabulous!<br />I'm so glad I own a copy of this movie! You Go Sam Raimi!!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|once you start playing this game you can't stop. its an extremely fun game and worth every Penny you don't pay XD.
B009S0VG42|3.0|I saw this film the night it was in theaters, drove two hours each way on a work night.  Film quality was a bit grainy, but mostly the problem is it jumps around, focusing on long shots and special effects, never letting you enjoy a 'moment' or the emotion of a song.  Like it's trying too hard to 'wow' you with how many people were there and how many cameras they had: too much magnitude, not enough intimacy.  With Coldplay sometimes less is more.  I saw the live concert from the fifth row twice, flying from CA to Houston the second time. Needless to say I loved the actual concert.  I have a video from my low-end Nikon camera where you can really see their faces and get a much better sense of the vibe of the show -- more of a 'you are there' feeling.  The DVD is too frenetic  and distant, physically and psychologically.  Should be more intimate, a la Katie Perry's.  In my humble opinion.  The music is of course fabulous; a smooth start-to-finish CD would be more satisfying.  (PS: watch the Paralympics closing ceremony show on line; it's way better, has mostly same songs, and free!)

B005LAIII0|5.0|\\"Life Of Pi\\" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: Based on the best-selling novel by Yann Martel, is a magical adventure story centering on Pi Patel, the precocious son of a zoo keeper. Dwellers in Pondicherry, India, the family decides to move to Canada, hitching a ride on a huge freighter. After a shipwreck, Pi finds himself adrift in the Pacific Ocean on a 26-foot lifeboat with a zebra, a hyena, an orangutan and a 450-pound Bengal tiger named Richard Parker, all fighting for survival.<br /><br />The cast led by Suraj Sharma (as Pi) & Irrfan Khan (as adult Pi) is brilliant. The (Oscar-winning) directing by Ang Lee (who also produced) is brilliant. The screenplay by David Magee (based on the novel) is brilliant.<br /><br />The (Oscar-winning) music by Mychael Danna is brilliant. The (Oscar-winning) cinematography by Claudio Miranda is brilliant. The film editing by Tim Squyres is brilliant. The casting by Avy Kaufman is brilliant. The production design by David Gropman is brilliant. The art direction by Al Hobbs, Ravi Srivastava, James F. Truesdale & Dan Webster is brilliant. The set decoration by Terry Lewis & Anna Pinnock, set designs by Sarah Contant, Jim Hewitt & Easton Michael Smith is brilliant. The costume design by Arjun Bhasin is brilliant. The special effects supervised by Jean-Martin Desmarais, coordinated by John Rosengrant, Alan Scott & Lindsay MacGowan is brilliant. The (Oscar-winning) visual effects supervised by Paul Graff, Susan MacLeod, Guillaume Rocheron & Bill Westenhofer, coordinated by Dana Lynn Bennett, Blair Brownlee, Rebecca Brookman, Bryce Brecheisen, Celine Chew, James Cochrane, Gloria Cohen, Sonia D'Costa, Sheila Giroux, Ankit Gokani, James Grummitt, Chad Hudson, Eric Kimelton, Monet Monge, Molly Pabian, Brett Skaggs, Judy Webster & Bryan Wengroff is brilliant. The stunts coordinated by Charles Croughwell & John Stoneham Jr. is brilliant.<br /><br />This is a brilliant and well-crafted (as well as, well-made) film that is entertaining and intriguing that is different and interesting. This is also a visually beautiful treat that is beautiful either in 3D or 2D. Ang Lee has made another interesting and well-made film that is definitely one of his best movies of his career. This is also one of the best films of the holiday season and of the year. This is also a film that should be remembered come the awards season.
B002L5EA4O|5.0|My sister used to watch this movie every morning before she went to school.  It's just a cute, funny, romantic movie.  And yes, I do love Robert Redford!!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I've seen both Ironman's and just loved them. Serious but had some humor as well. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone that love's Marvel characters as well as the wonderful cast you put in this movie. I just loved everyone.

B0063GORYU|5.0|One of my very favorite games to be played at several levels.  Start out easy and advance to a harder level

B0094BB4TW|5.0|I enjoy facebook, keeping up with the activities of my friends and relatives, finding out what's new in their lives, seeing their latest pictures and sharing mine.
B00932AA5G|5.0|This movie was free for Prime members.  I never heard about this movie before.  I just went by the fact that it was free for me, it had some great reviews, and it was a recent movie.  This movie just went above and beyond any expectations that I had.  One of the best movies that I have ever seen. Totally different from the type of movie that I was expecting.  I didn't even watch the trailer.  I just read the synopsis given by Amazon.  The details in this movie is just unbelievable and the time just flew by.  There was never any part of the movie where it felt slow or boring.  I loved this movie and so glad that it was in the prime section or I would have never even thought about watching it.  I wouldn't be surprised if they remake this movie in the America.
B0012GMV58|5.0|I heard Welcome the year it was released.  I worked in a record store at the time and the boss put it on.  I wasn't really that impressed.  I thought the track Love, Devotion and Surrender was pretty cheesy as I recall. I was listening to good music then, stuff like King Crimson, but had not yet made the leap to jazz or fusion.  A couple of years later I had discovered Miles Davis (via Big Fun) and John Coltrane (via A Love Supreme).  Around this same time someone turned me on to Borboletta (still fantastic today) and Illuminations but I'd forgotten all about Welcome.  I recently returned to the Santana catalog and picked up the remasters through Borboletta.  Welcome was... a welcome addition to my collection.  This is a different kind of Santana.  I think this was the first full length appearance of Tom Coster on a Santana release (he guested on Caravanserai, he was key in taking Santana's sound to the next level musically.The percussion is still in there; however the music is more focused.  The vocals are a huge improvement over Greg Rollie's limited range.  Leon Thomas and Flora Purim were established in the jazz world (Leon with Pharaoh Sanders, Count Basie and Purim with Corea's Return to Forever).  I have no idea why I thought Love, Devotion and Surrender was cheesy, this is great stuff. Leon Thomas' vocals are particularly soulful.  When I saw his name in the notes I was a little concerned.  Leon has this yodeling thing he used to do that was interesting the first time I heard it but it got old fast.  There is very little of that sound here and the little bit that I heard was way down in the mix as a kind of effect.  Great music is great music.  No point getting into the details.  I've read here on Amazon that Santana releases are rather like trilogies.  Welcome's sound and is exactly what one would expect given it is bookend by Caravanserai and Borboletta.  It fits beautifully between those two releases.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun and addictive. Good brain exercise for any age. It makes you exercise your visual perspective and think twice about how you're seeing a pattern.
B000001ESP|5.0|I have just recently discovered Rush,  I am very happy I made the purchase.  I bought the cd for one song.  The rest are just added treasure.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|This app is fine. There hasn't been any glitches, the pic is really sharp, & I really have no complaints about this app. I know it has advertisements but they don't really bother me or get in the way of the game. Would recommend the free app unless yo really don't like the apps then just buy it. Is really nice app though for being free.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I really like this as it has up to the minute weather for any locations I enter.  Would recommend for anyone and especially those who travel a lot.
B009CF3P7E|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie. Will watch it over and over and over and over and over and over and over again.
B008MEM24S|4.0|Good for killing down time and occupying the kids.  Would suggest it fot parents of kids 5 and up.  Enjoy the silence.
1419705849|3.0|Okay, while some may beg to differ, I'm going to just come out and say it: The Third Wheel, in my opinion, is the worst book in the DOAWK series. It just didn't really draw me in like the rest. It was still fairly entertaining though, it just dosen't live up to the earlier books in the series. Just my opinion :/
B0014D6PCO|5.0|A great movie, the best of the Batman series. Wonderful to watch and a great addition to ones library. Recommended.
B005HSL626|3.0|The game is fun but I have to admit the ads are annoying & unfortunately it freezes at times. So I'll have to shut down the game & then reopen it. So if anything I would recommend to buy the game. Most bought games are not so glitchy. It's okay though for being free, it gives you a chance to try it out at least.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Not your normal courtroom drama. In fact, it was a little boring - I actually put it down for days at a time, then had trouble remembering what happened earlier. I will still look forward to Grisham's next book...
1423140605|5.0|.......I've never felt so emotionally struck at the end of a novel. This is, without a doubt, a truly worthy successor to the Percy Jackson series. Amazing book.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Excellent in all respects, this movie is Sandra Bullocks best so far!! This story inspires all to look out for the champions yet to be discovered.

B00026WU3M|5.0|Classic Dylan—Not his greatest album, however like every one of his albums there are at least a few gems. Highly recommended for those who want a complete collection.
B001CTGQBK|4.0|It was fun sharing this movie with my 12 year old, after she and her sister were singing grease lightning from Glee.  I had forgotten how intense some scenes were, but we discussed how inappropriate they were.  With parental supervision, I think it is safe to enjoy the musical aspect of the story.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is very easy to use. It always pulls up. The large numbers are easy to read. the best part is that it is free!

0064471047|5.0|this was a fantastic book.  very well written and is intense and keeps you in suspense.  very enjoyable.  not boring in the least.
0307346617|4.0|I'd thought that there could be nothing more done to zombie stories to make them original and fresh. World War Z proved me wrong. The book turned out to be much different than I thought it would. My initial assumptions were that it would have a more comedic element because the author's father is none other than Mel Brooks. Instead, I was fascinated with the zombies, but more with the mix of statements about life, human nature, and politics hidden within the pages.<br /><br />First off, Max brooks conducted thorough research for the book, especially pertaining to the military, their actions, vehicles, weapons, etc. What impressed me the most about this is how well he described the M1A1 Abrams Main Battle Tank. As a former Abrams tank crewman for five years, two and a half of which I was a Sergeant therefore a gunner, I knew everything about the tank and there was not a single out of place fact in World War Z. I have written a short story about soldiers in Iraq and focused on the tank crewmen. During a scene in which my protagonist wants to take out a group of enemy on top of a rooftop, he has his loader load a canister round into the breach. I wrote that the \\"giant shotgun shell was fired\\" and \\"released its payload of one-thousand tungsten steel balls.\\" Although not anymore, I had learned about the round's capabilities and internal structure when it was brand new and classified, my platoon being one of the first in the Army to carry these rounds in Iraq. This was less than a year or so before Max Brooks described the round as a giant shotgun shell containing tungsten steel balls as well in World War Z. Not only has Brooks done his research, he had found information even some tank crewmen hadn't known at the time of the book's publication. Very few people I have ever spoken to know what a canister round is, even if they've served. Aside from the canister round, all the information about the Abrams tank was accurate. Furthermore, there was much more information about the MOPP suits, training, shooting, infantry tactics, etc. that were just as accurate. Maybe it's because I'm a veteran, but I found the military scenes and the closeness to reality very fascinating. I now have to move away from the military scenes otherwise I'll be here all day and crash some servers with how much I can talk about my old tank.<br /><br />The book is designed to read like a collection of personal interviews from survivors of the zombie war that was waged across every part of the Earth to include the bottom of the oceans. What I found interesting were the zombies were the background to the humans of the story; although the living dead was the reason for mankind' suffering, the pain and heartbreak usually didn't stem from a zombie killing a family member but from what certain people had to do to other people. Many times troops were told to pull away from the civilians to fend for themselves, or people only helped others when monetary compensation and fame were the goal, and running instead of helping. The humans were much scarier than the undead that were destroying the world. While not everyone is bad or selfish in World War Z, there is a large amount of those who were. A prime example of a character as being selfish is Breckinridge Scott in Vostok Station: Antarctica. He knows that \\"fear sells\\" and markets a drug that works against rabies and people had been calling the zombie virus the African rabies, but Scott knows the drug he sells won't actually help.<br /><br />As for the zombies, they were stereotypical. I don't think there was anything new about them otherwise I would have taken a note on it. Because they were used as the catalyst of the story, but not central to it, as I believe the story is more about human vs. human, it wasn't too important and didn't ruin the story by walking with their arms extended before themselves.<br /><br />I can't help but feel Brooks was making a point about how well the world's nations get along with each other all the way down to humans. Russia was Russia, no definition really needed there, but the rest of the world was brought together, forming the new U.N. and working with each other to reestablish humans as the superior force on the Earth. Is that what it would take to end the constant strife between nations, a zombie apocalypse? I may have been reading to deeply between the lines, imagining the entire sub-text pertaining to human and political interaction. However, most certainly the Israeli and Palestinian conflict was written about. As a Jew, I do watch the news and read up on the conflict, hoping for peace, praying the Palestinian people accept a Jewish state, while praying that Israel treats the Palestinians with respect and stop with the graffiti of Arab home (a small Jewish extremist movement does this, but a small group can make a large group look bad, i.e. Osama Bin Laden for Muslims, and know they and their religion are respectable as I have had plenty of good Muslim friends). Brooks only gives Israel and Palestine respect for each other after an Israeli saves a Palestinian's life. Was this another statement there, Max?<br /><br />I enjoyed this work tremendously and hope to see Max brooks come out with more work in the near future.ll the way down to humans.

1612680011|5.0|So you want to be rich? No matter what you do, financial IQ is very important. Robert is a great writer and his life journey would probably touches most of us. This book doesn't tell you how to make money but it is a great start to restart your mind and think about it. There are many key elements Robert teach within the book. I recommend anyone that interested in becoming financially freedom.

B00466HM28|1.0|I bought mine May of 2012, it is now November of 2012, it has never worked. All this time I have been surfing for answers. The editor controller is confusing, and there is NO DOCUMENTATION to guide you except a 10 page brief that doesn't help at all. I tried to get this to work on Magix Music Maker and Mixcraft 6 and never could. I truly wish I could return it. Unless you are very experienced in DAW music production, Buyer beware!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|The pictures were a great addition to the story and I cannot wait to see the movie. I heard that Depp and Burton were making the movie.

B008CPZNL6|3.0|It doesn't rotate when your Kindle Fire is rotated. Also it doesn't seem to let me sign in to Pocket.
B0077EBWVI|3.0|The original Footloose is about loss, recovery and morality.  While this version keeps fragments of these themes, it has more to do with religion and politics.  For me, this makes the difference between an amazing story and an average one.<br /><br />It's still worth watching, but I do not think it has the impact or poignancy of the original movie.
B000VZNHPO|3.0|Hmmm. Kanye is very funny. I don't take his music seriously because its so funny. All the song have a nice beat. I rather enjoy this one.

B007P3TMW2|5.0|This movie is great.  We were able to watch it on our Kindle Fire on the airplane and during a layover.  While we were watching this movie and crying another family was watching something else and laughing.  I still would watch this one.  Great acting and a fabulous story.

B0031YJFCQ|4.0|Good ending to the trilogy. I wish more could come from this author yet sadly this is it. I liked it b/c it kept the same pace as the first and second book and didn't feel rushed.

B0066W1AZK|5.0|My Kindle Fire but this is the game my husband loves playing on it. It teaches and plays just like a real person.
0385536828|5.0|\\"Sweet Tooth for Ian: as a writer, I only read brilliant writers like Mr. McEwan. I loved ATONEMENT & SWEET TOOTH equally. You and Robert Olen Butler demonstrate the craft of writing like a woman writing like a man writing like a woman: very Heideggerian `subject' and `object' with a perfect epistolary ending. As an Air America/CIA widow Viet-Nam 68-70 JCM 18 Feb 70, I enjoyed the contrast to the Petraeus/Broadwell contrast to Haley/Frome affair. A nice \\"Serena\\" wrap. TBA David/Paula.

B009AJDDQU|3.0|Watched thru Amazon Prime via Roku. Excellent quality, no glitches.<br /><br />As for the movie. Like others, I really wanted to like it. Here at the end, I am disappointed and confused. There are many reviews that go into specifics, so I will not. However, terrible casting and writing.<br /><br />Anyway, I am glad I watched it. I now have it out of my system. Would I recommend to anyone else? Well, if you like this type of stuff and have nothing else to do and a few bucks to waste, go for it. Like I said, it is ok.
B000SEGUDE|2.0|This book was very disjointed and hard to follow.  I planned on going to the movie, but after reading the book, I'll just stay home.
B009CG2YDE|5.0|if you like retro games like space invaders you will love this. simple to play and challenging enough to be fun. I would recommend this game. download this and give it a try.
B001GCUO1Q|4.0|X-Men Origins Wolverine is a good action movie with great fight scenes between all the characters.  Also has some amazing special effects in mutiple scenes, plus another aspect I enjoyed about the movie was the backstory on finding out how Wolverine got his name from.  Also another good point in the movie was the flashback to the wars make the scenes so real with the fliming.  But if your a X-Men fan in general or die hardcore fan then pick this movie up and watch how the character Wolverine came about from both what you already know and what info you may not know yet.  One bonus note to add if you have other mutants you like from the series a few of them are inculded in this movie like Gambit, Cyclops, and so forth.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|If you love the supernatural combined with action and romance, you'll enjoy this series.  Just saw the movie trailer, and I can't wait.  I'm no teeny bopper either.  With 28 & 21 year olds I still love the fantasy of the shadow hunter series.
B009LK6JS2|4.0|Challenging enough to keep your attention, easy enough that you won't get frustrated because you are not progressing.  Only problem I have is when I switch planes on the game select screens, it doesn't change the plane during the game play.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Great story, lots of info about why we as a species were built to run, a bit about how to do just that, plus some insight into a sport that hardly anyone knows anything about. At times seemed to be aranged like &#34;Pulp Fiction&#34; which is why I couldn't put it down.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This drives me crazy.  I keep playing it and replaying levels because things change.  It is truly addictive and may be responsible for me getting less done at home.
B0045XICB2|4.0|This movie is by far the best Twilight!! This was the first Twilight I watched and from then on I purchased all the other series. If you are a Twilight fan add this to your collection and if you're not, try it and you won't regret!!!
B000OVLBEO|4.0|Ghost Rider 2 dics extended cut is a good action with a good acting job by Cage and to be he was perfect casting choice for this role.  Some say he has gone downhill since movies The Rock, Con Air, and Face Off.  But I still enjoy almost all of Cage's movies. I have watched this movie 4 times now since I have bought it, it keeps my intrest from start to finish and I never get tired of it. I think the scene that did it for me was when he was changing into the Ghost Rider and laughing like a crazy person, no other actor could have done that personality like Cage does.  But if your just looking for a feel good action movie, with some great songs within the movie, and great acting jobs from Petter Fonda as the Devil, Cage as the Ghost Rider, and Eva Mendes as Cage's love intrest then get this movie.  Some scenes are over the top but if your into whole Marvel comics stories then pick this movie up sit back and enjoy a fun movie to unwind to on a day off.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|I was glued to my seat for each episode and can't wait to see more...<br />The acting is superb and the story line well written!

0307352145|5.0|Quiet was really helpful because it helped me understand introverts better, which in turn helped me understand myself better. I appreciated the style and honesty with which the Cain writes as well. A book like this was needed on the market because so many people don't understand introverts. We live in a world that can't stop talking and start thinking. Good read.
B0085TKAW6|5.0|Bloody great is the only way i can describe it. A true Follett story. Looking forward to the end of the trilogy.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Its a short read but a good read. The story is good just a little to predictable for me. I feel like this book makes Katniss seem a little dumb but maybe its just me. Anyway its worth a read and since movies are being made about this trilogy its always good to read the book first. The book is always better than the movie anyway. Happy Reading! :)
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I spent most the book trying to figure out why Pat got into these rages and was deeply troubled and such. He reminded me a lot of myself except I don't have rage issues. I am still not sure what his mental condition is, but he really finds his inner peace by the end of the book. After pages of not getting anywhere with his issues he finally seems to learn to self soothe.
B0083GQKQG|5.0|The writing, directing and acting is all superb in this disturbing thriller with more twists and turns than a pretzel.
159420411X|5.0|If the extent of your knowledge of Nate Silver is simply what pop culture tells you, you will be surprised.  Silver isn't interested in being a partisan of any stripe, whether it be politics, sabrmetrics, etc.  He simply tries to look at what the data tells us.<br /><br />While that's a pretty standard claim, very few approach it with the humility he does.  When dealing with political pundits, he is quick to stress the entirely justifiable reasons so many political pundits make so many outlandish predictions, and, contrary to belief, just how difficult forecasting something as fluid as political thought can be.  That it is difficult does not mean it is impossible however.<br /><br />In the end that is what this book is about.  Yes, things happen along predictable patterns, but you cannot forget the human element.  Something as complex as human nature is going to give a lot of confusing results.  Works like The Signal and the Noise do their best to make it less confusing.
0345803507|5.0|I wish there were more books in this series-I found the book more romantic than erotic. Younger friends would not read it-they found it too erotic. I guess they have never experienced such deep fellings for someone!
B000U0F7RG|5.0|The DVD set was everything I expected it to be. I have wanted to find this set for a fair price for many years and finally decided to check online and found that amazon was selling the set for at least half the price of retail stores. This is one of my favorite television shows and I probably watch the DVD every single day. The packaging is really enticing and there are some cool extras that come with the set that you wouldn't get if you bought the DVD seasons separately.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|its the best .you should try. it my hole family loves it. they have the curer animals. it is fun

0062127241|5.0|We all know that Pete Townshend is a brilliant songwriter.  What we didn't know is what a great storyteller he is in a longer format.  This autobiography is honest, captivating and funny without trying too hard.  It sounds like Pete is telling his life story to a close friend.
B00A1AD6ZU|4.0|I bought  The Devil  Colony because I had  finished reading  everything written by Dan Brown and  Michael Crichton, so I thought I would give James Rollins a try.  I was unaware this book  is part of a series; however, it stands alone very well.<br />I enjoyed the book immensely; it was an interesting mix of history, fiction, information, and modern technology.  The Devil Colony is  fast-paced and is a good escape for mystery/ suspense readers. I will definitely be reading more James Rollins and I highly recommend this book.
B009CG2YDE|2.0|It has terrible graffics, seemingly pointless, the levels dont get any harder. it is just a terrible rip off of galga.
B00956UPSW|5.0|Phil sounds GREAT! The guys put together some SICK riffs! For me this is there best work since Nola, can't wait to see what the rest of the EP's will be like.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|one of the best shows ever, wouldn't miss it and would watch it over again!  easy to download an episode and cheaper than itunes
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham knows how to tell a story and hold one's interest.  I am always entertained and interested in what he says and how he says it.  Enjoy!  Grisham handles dialogue almost as well as Mark Twain.  He is often in first person narrative; therefore does not have to get involved with &#34;I said - she said  etc.,&#34; and he knows how to move the story forward.
B004RSCWZ2|4.0|ok, that was what Bonnie said on her last stop in Phoenix with Taj Mahal when both bands played together... I got the same feeling listening to this fine collaboration .  Susan's bluesy, rootsy vocals are the perfect complement to Derek's great licks on the slide guitar. As some have suggested, this could be an instant classic, especially for those of us who cherish a tight big-band performance that very closely replicates the live experience.
B001FB5634|5.0|arrived quickly, but Im not sure it was new. The disc looked fine but the shrink wrap was strangely looser than what you might see if you bought it from a store. Hmmmm. I guess I'll never know. This is a great movie, but depressing as hell.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is an excellent book for both women and men. a bit slow at beginning but after that - Very steamy! I will definitely read the next one.

B000YJ85BI|4.0|These are science fiction sociology - - a little like Heinlein's Tunnel in the Sky  - - - - but  not told as directly as Heinlein writes.There are moments where explanation becomes tedioius.
B008N2Z1L0|4.0|listened to it twice on a cross-country plane ride and it stands up well to previous efforts.  very tight band and reaching into some different nooks and crannies.
B005HJWWW8|3.0|This is a BUDGET unit.  The problem is that with low impedance headphones it will make them sound a little better, but the difference isn't huge as your mp3 player probably already drives them decently.  But then with high impedance headphones, like the hifiman re-262, it doesn't have enough juice to drive them.  I bought these to use with that headphone, which has a ohm rating of 150.  It simply didn't do the job and I almost sold the headphones.  They sounded muddy and there was no clarity.  I then upgraded to a JDS Labs c421 (fantastic) and found out how great a difference there really is between this anything more expensive.<br /><br />The only reason I can see someone buying this is either for the price, or the extremely small footprint,<br /><br />Save yourself the time, and ultimately the money, and go for at least the fiio e11 or better.  The best value in a headphone amp ont he market right now is the JDS 421 which will drive even my hifiman he-500 to decent multitudes.
B005C0DHEY|5.0|This was hard to say \\"love it\\" because the information was so troubling.  But it has to be said... I couldn't help but think of the movie Erin Brockovich and how people all over the country championed it... millions of lawsuits just like that are going to have to happen with lots of time and money wasted.  It seems like renewable sources of energy such as wind and solar are perfect opportunities for us to protect what we have been given... if people didn't overuse (and I'm one of them), wind and solar should be enough.  Let's put a solar panel field the size of Rhode Island in the middle of the Arizona desert... i was just there, there is plenty of Public land for that... I think that would get us pretty far.<br /><br />Hopeful I'm Not a Benzene Drinker,<br /><br />Bo from North Georgia
B008YRVW0I|4.0|This is a creative and artistic pursuit.  I've managed to get gold cups on my tanks as 4 different players and I'm not bored yet.  Fun and not too difficult.  The match 3 grids are increasingly challenging.  Try it . You won;t be sorry.
B009VB97EY|4.0|It was a pleasure to watch.  We streamed it on the wall which made it even better!  Definitely recommend this movie.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|This was the best of the three.  The transference of the mind to a younger body is interesting - A bit like Heinlein's Time Enough for Love - - - Scalzi handles that very well.  I feel that this is the best of the three.  The plot is tight and moves forward to a good conclusion.  Very satisfying.
B009CG2YDE|5.0|Survive waves of pixel art baddies. Suggestion to developers- change icon art to match in game to attract pixel art fans.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|One of the very best Christmas stories ever!!  I recommend it to everyone who loves Christmas and fantasies.<br />Top notch.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Sixto Rodriguez is a phenomenal talent and this CD is excellent. If you are not familiar with his work, you should check it out. You will definitely be blown away.
B0095VP8D4|5.0|This is good for what it is. If you will be playing games just buy a better heatsink and fan. Before I bought a better fan the stock fan would hold the processor at 71 C which was pretty hot. Good graphics, I want to crossfire this.
B0063GORYU|5.0|If you love solitaire and want something new get this. It has a help option to figure out what to do because I hadn't ever seen anything like it before. Fun to play over and over again.
0062073192|3.0|Very good book but the only downfall for me was some of the print was very small so I had to skip some of it.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I actually saw the movie before I read the book. Enjoyed the movie so much that it inspired me to read the book(s).
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|I truly enjoyed Matched.  When I started reading Crossed, I wasn't expecting the trek across country.  That got old, fast.  I guess I kept reading, because it could only get better, right?  Wrong.  Never got better.  Cassia and Ty magically reunite and go off to do different things for the rebels.
B00727AM3Y|5.0|John Green did an amazing job with this book. I laughed, cried, and wished for more. I fell in love with the characters and the book was masterfully written.  I highly recommend this novel to anyone!

0061367036|5.0|I am a big fan of the series and I enjoyed this book very much.  It was  very interesting and I enjoyed reading about all the different demons and monsters. My kind of book
B004Q3SGWG|5.0|I enjoy true life stories. Love watching James Franco. I watched it with my 12 year old son and we both enjoyed it.
0062124293|3.0|I really did enjoy reading this book, so why am I only giving it three stars?  I am going to try to be a thorough as possible so that you can decide whether to buy this, check it out at the library, or skip it altogether.<br /><br />First, yes, this book is full of vulgarity and foul language.  If such things easily offend you, I would recommend skipping this book.  Personally, I did not find any of it offensive.<br /><br />Second, this book has its funny moments.  There were times I actually found myself laughing aloud, while at others, I was just reading fast to get through the parts that I could tell were supposed to be funny.<br /><br />As an American reading this, I feel that I missed a lot of the humor of the book due to the cultural references.  As another reviewer mentioned, those in the UK speak English, but some parts of this book are like reading something written in a foreign language.  Nevertheless, still, there were very funny parts that I did understand.<br /><br />One complaint about I have about this book is the fact that some parts feel like they go on and on, for no reason at all.  It was usually during the middle of a chapter when I would get this feeling, and I would think, \\"Was Moran trying to reach a word minimum in this section?\\"  Some bits just dragged on.<br /><br />Now, to get to the meat of the book.  This book is one part memoir, one part feminist opinion, and one part vulgarity and humor.  The problem I have here is that I went in expecting this book to be mostly feminist opinion.  Unfortunately, this book focuses very much on Moran's life, yet when it gets to the feminist tie-ins, she does not explain her opinions very thoroughly.  I found Moran to be very funny and intelligent; however, the way she glossed over some issues (such as the chapter on strip clubs) and did not actually explain why she holds the view that she does, I walked away very disappointed.  Because I know that Moran is capable of thinking and reasoning, I would haveliked to read a lot more about it when it came to her feminist viewpoints.<br /><br />For me, this book tried to do too much, as I mentioned in the last paragraph.  If it was supposed to be a memoir, I would have liked to know more about her life, as just select instances are discussed here.  (For example, she mentions her husband many times, but we never really learn much about him.)  If this book was supposed to be about feminism, it also failed there, as the feminist sections of each chapter only made up a scant amount of the content.<br /><br />Another reviewer also pointed out that Moran is contradictory in her views.  At some points, she claims that feminism is about a woman's choice to do whatever she wants, yet she also holds certain strong viewpoints in opposition to this, but does not explain them.<br /><br />This is an easy read, and as I mentioned, it is quite funny at times and definitely offers some good insights.  I just wish that Moran had focused more on the feminist message of the book and really explained her reasoning on certain topics, as some of her opinions seem completely contradictory.<br /><br />Also, if you are very religious or strongly against abortion, there is one chapter that is likely to offend you.
031620157X|5.0|I loved this book.  The language was perfect for the age group it was aimed at.  The story line made me rethink how I had previously thought about fairy tales.  It offered a new perspective into old stories and it was a great book.  I highly recommend it.
B00843TZJ2|5.0|This was a classic IMPULSE BUY - I had just gotten in from seeing a STUPENDOUS concert by CSN in San Rafael, CA and at home later that night in my e-mail was a thing from Amazon that included this DVD. I went for it. No regrets. This whole generation of performers is getting up there... this is a great document of a stirring performance. Well worth buying - Recommended highly to fans of CSN.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|This is the greatest animation of the year. Excellent Scottish accents. The soundtrack is equaly great. Not only chilndren will enjoy this, but the entire family.

B009AY04A8|3.0|Stopped working at level 16. Wouldn't load. Otherwise it was a pretty good ho game. The dialogue is annoying but can be blocked.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|PERFECT, NO OVER KILL ON THE DRAMA. JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF ACTION. THE CHARICTERS ARE VERY LIKEABLE AND KEEP YOU INTERESTED
B00A77II0U|5.0|A great point and click adventure.  I had no problems with downloading or playing the game.  A good story with a touching ending I can hardly wait fir the second chapter.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|The movie was better than the first one. Specially Arnold and Chuck were part of it. All the best actors that I followed since I qas young. Ezcellent movie. There has to be another.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Loved the storyline: the main characters are teenagers faced with the battles of having cancer and surviving cancer. Very heartwarming and well-written. The only flaw in my mind is that the teenagers, albeit very intelligent, used words in their vocabulary and referenced topics that most educated, sophisticated adults don't even use or are aware of. I consider myself fairly intelligent and I had to look up a dozen words that these &#34;teenagers&#34; were using in their text messages!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Best movie I have seen in years.  All acting was top notch.  The plot was thorough and realistic.  Each character was fully fleshed out (love them or hate them).<br /><br />This movie was clearly not written for the hormone ridden youth that most movies seem to be written for these days.  You will likely watch the movie in silence, but have quite a bit to say about it afterwards.  Good couples movie for couples that have some life experience under their belts.  It ends as expected, with both sadness and hope.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|artistic, catchy, also they are good live. just a great album by a new and upcoming band. buy it now ( i also bought it for 4 bucks, compared to the 6 bucks on i-tunes.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Kay Scarpetta ( through Patricia Cornwell) held my interest from page one.  Familiarity of characters from previous novels keeps the flow of the novel smooth.  It's hard to not finish the book in one read.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great story, excellent acting, and fantastic special effects. We are devotees of the graphic novels and we love how they incorporate the best elements from the series while still providing lots of surprises.  Keeps getting better each season.
B009C7JS14|4.0|After trying out several other apps, this one works better and quicker than others.  The background graphics look great on my Kindle Fire HD.
B00005NVDI|5.0|this is one of my favorite episodes for the third year (last battlefield).  the quality of the dvd was top notch.
B002L3RVCY|5.0|Whats great about this is that if you are a Star Wars fan, you will enjoy it.  Be it as a kid or adult.  In some ways you can say that the Clone Wars series does better than the Episode 1-3 movies.  The timeline is between episodes 2 and 3.  The stories are engaging and have a theme to each one with a very slight story arch.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Well this movie wasn't the only reason that I decided to change to a vegan lifestyle, but it was one of the factors.  The scenes from the \\"pink slime\\" factory are memorable to show what poisons some people will still claim to be food.  At the time I still ate hamburgers and wondered why sometimes they tasted like ammonia.  They were!  Joke on me.  I thought they were all beef as advertized.  HA-HA, silly me.
B00A31UXLW|5.0|In 1992, Detective Harry Bosch and his partner, Jerry Edgar, were on emergency rotation during the infamous Los Angeles riots, and were \\"dispatched to any place they were needed--wherever a body turned up.\\"  Fires, looting, and gang violence transformed L. A. into a war zone, with \\"all semblance of dignity and moral code gone in the smoke that rose over the city.\\"  In order to deal with a tidal wave of looting, revenge killings, and scores of other incidents, the police had to cut corners.  \\"In the chaos of the moment the mission was simple:  preserve the evidence, document the scene as best and as fast as possible, and collect the dead.\\"<br /><br />Bosch and Edgar roll up to an alley near Crenshaw Boulevard, where a thirty-two year old Danish photojournalist had been shot in the head at close range.  The deceased is Anneke Jespersen, whom Edgar nicknames \\"Snow White.\\"  Bosch finds a 9mm shell casing at the scene but little else, and for twenty years, Jespersen's murder remains unsolved.  In 2012, Harry takes another look, knowing that finding Jespersen's killer after so much time has elapsed is, at best, a long shot.<br /><br />\\"The Black Box\\" is vintage Connelly, and Bosch is as stubborn and relentless as ever.  He ignores his superiors when they try to derail him and pursues every lead, no matter how small, with a laser-like focus.  Harry visits San Quentin to interview a gangbanger; traces an intriguing phone call that was placed ten years after Anneke's death; and asks for help from anyone who may be able to shed light on his case.  With a bit of luck and solid detective work, he manages to narrow down his list of suspects to a few individuals who may have been responsible for a vicious crime and cover-up.  Although he is a cop first and foremost, Harry is also a devoted dad (his sixteen-year-old daughter, Maddie, is precocious and a chip off the old block), and he continues his warm but unresolved relationship with Hannah Stone.<br /><br />The plot is involving and, for the most part, realistic.  Connelly's dialogue and prose are, as always, forceful, brisk, and fast-paced. Bosch works tirelessly to move his investigation forward, but when he hits a dead end, he never considers quitting in frustration.  He merely looks at things from a fresh angle and relies on his famous gut instinct to steer him in the right direction.  Although his job is exasperating, tedious, and frequently nerve-wracking, when Harry nails a villain, he is elated.  At an age when most of his peers have \\"pulled the pin\\" and retired to a life of ease, Harry refuses to part ways with the LAPD; he has signed a contract under the Deferred Retirement Option Plan.  Bosch is still driven to fix what is broken in a criminal justice system that is too often criminally unjust.g and, for the most part, realistic.

B008G59IKO|1.0|At first I did not like Uno, but there was something about it that made me give a few more listens. I was pleasantly surprised when I discovered that the album grew on me. It didn't blow my mind like American Idiot. Uno is definitely NOT the Jesus of Suburbia. Dos, however, was so awful (granted there's two tracks I can stand) that I had to force myself to give a second listen.Still appalled, I waited two days to give it a teeth gritting third listen. Folks, save your money and listen on youtube. This is not the Green Day you love. This is garbage. Youtube \\"Nightlife\\" and you'll be heading to shred your old ticket stubs from their shows.

The great part about buying in on IPad is the video's of author interviews, scenes, etc.  The vocabulary is somewhat difficult so it helps to have and instant dictionary.<br /><br />Highly recommend downloading the book.

0316228532|5.0|I have been a fan of J.K. Rowling since I first picked up Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone but I've never enjoyed anything she's written as much as The Casual Vacancy.  It appears that being freed from the fetters of her imagined magical world has allowed her to show us a view of the real world, the one in which we all live, that is more vibrant and alive than anything Harry, Ron and Hermione could experience.<br /><br />At its core, The Casual Vacancy hearkens back to a much older type of English novel, something like Middlemarch, with its explorations of race, gender and especially class and its setting in a common-or-garden variety English village.  Rowling deftly draws us into her characters lives and shows us what makes them tick.  The characters are all familiar, not because they remind us of characters from Harry Potter (they don't) but because they remind us of people we know and are.<br /><br />The pain and joy of growing up has always been something Rowling has written about well and in The Casual Vacancy she is able to explore adolescence without having to sugar-coat the experience with the promise of magic in the background.  For a teenager, fighting against Ultimate Evil Incarnate is not nearly as terrible as the quotidian horrors of boredom and embarrassment.  The young people in The Casual Vacancy are not all nice kids but Rowling is able to pop us into their minds to see what motivates them as individuals.<br /><br />Her portraits of the middle-aged are no less compelling.  The teenagers in The Casual Vacancy tend to see escape from Pagford as the ticket to a \\"real\\" life.  For many of the adults, either this kind of flight is impossible or they are old enough to realize that it is futile to think in these terms.  Their lives are in the carapaces they have constructed for themselves.<br /><br />There is disturbing material in this book.  Speech and action are at times vulgar and violent.  Sex is messy.  Bad things happen to characters we care about.  But nothing feels gratuitous or out of place.  People in The Casual Vacancy act the way they do because of who they are, and that is what makes it a great novel.

085793841X|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1CICSD5AA51G0]]<br /><br />AN OVERVIEW OF THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK OF PUBLIC PROCUREMENT WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />It may not have occurred to non-practitioners, but as every practitioner knows -- especially the EU practitioner -- the delivery of public services depends on public procurement and therefore the laws that govern it.  We may be over simplifying the case here, but certainly this well regarded book by Christopher H. Bovis expounds upon it and clarifies it admirably.<br /><br />The title has been recently published by Edward Elgar Publications Limited, and as part of its European Law series, `EU Public Procurement Law' in the words of the author `aims to provide the reader with a comprehensive analysis of the law and jurisprudence which have shaped the landscape of the regulation of public procurement in the European Union and its member states.'<br /><br />The purpose of regulating procurement, says the author, is primarily to insert competitiveness into the relevant markets, the aim being to eliminate non-tariff barriers to trade as well as preferential purchasing, which may tend to favour one nation against another.  Well regulated procurement practices, on the other hand, encourage -- indeed insist -- on accountability and the avoidance of corruption and undue political influence.<br /><br />Among a host of other issues the author examines the public policy aspects of procurement, including industrial policy and the anti-trust dimension.  The regulation of public procurement says the author, is one of the most important drivers for both competitiveness and growth in the EU Member States.<br /><br />Distinguished by its clarity and readability, `EU Public Procurement Law' puts procurement firmly within a legal context and is an important book for EU practitioners, academics and judges as well as policy-makers and decision-makers not only within the EU, but internationally.<br /><br />Meticulously and extensively footnoted, it contains a useful table of cases before the European Court of Justice, plus -- a detailed index at the back for further ease of use.

The quest to find out who murdered her family leads Libby on a journey to find herself and eventually who changed the course of her life forever. Gillian's characters are so fatally flawed yet human enough to relate to.

(United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea)<br /><br />The author, Simone Borg, an environmental lawyer and academic, argues (as the title indicates) for further and better harmonization of conservation laws between diverse countries.<br /><br />This is a much needed study of conservation on the high seas and the need for differing `regimes' (we would call them `jurisdictions') to achieve greater harmonization of the legal landscape in this matter.  As one commentator has pointed out, the unique feature of this book is that it is `firmly entrenched in international law' and therefore focuses mainly on issues of fragmentation and harmonization of international with a view to ensuring the conservation of living marine resources on a sustainable basis.<br /><br />Another extremely valuable aspect of the book is that it opens up an almost infinite number of avenues for further research.  Check out, for example, the bibliography of almost 13 pages.  There are also tables of cases and treaties and a detailed index at the back.<br /><br />If you are an international or environmental lawyer, (or both, as the two areas inevitably overlap) this copiously footnoted book should be added to your professional library. The publication date is cited as at 2012.br />If you are an international or environmental lawyer, (or both, as the two areas inevitably overlap) this copiously footnoted book should be added to your professional library.

B008XG1X18|5.0|This app is great on my kindle fire. I love it better than the Internet download one.  Try it, you'll like it too!!
B008Q7O6VS|4.0|A dvd would of made it 5 stars.Material with bonus poster in collective case provided the rating i gave it
B00931JMRE|4.0|Like this Album. Has a great blues sound. They make alot of good music for 3 guys. First Album from ZZ top i bought in years.
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|with modern production...  Excellent range shown by this band.  More than meet the ear from just what you'll hear on the radio...
0345803507|5.0|I loved all three books and could not put them down.  The only thing that made me tire was some of the love seen in the book.  It got old after reading so many of them.  However; all in all the three books were well worth the read.
0345529057|5.0|I love these books. I'm super glad I was able to get the first four in paperback for such a good deal.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Very good trilogy to read.  After the second book was complete I just had to read the third book to finish what was started in the beginning.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read the book after seeing the movie and was amazed how faithful the movie was to the book.  Easy to read, deep concepts well executed.  Bravo!
0547884591|3.0|I ordered this because nutrition guru Isabel De Los Rios sent me a spam email about this great \\"cookbook\\" with awesome how-to photos.  I did not watch the Amazon trailer, but I should have.  This book is more like how to catch and skin pigeons, poach salmon in the bathroom sink, and survive in the wilderness than it is a beginner's cookbook.  I was expecting \\"The Joy of Cooking\\" and got, well, the ADHD Guide to Life. Obviously I was NOT paying attention when I ordered it :)
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I really use this app a lot since I use my kindle fire so much. I check regularly so I can charge it while in use .<br />I often use my kindle fire for 4or5 hrs at a time.I am thinking about getting the complete app.
B004MPESSY|5.0|Its always nice to see movies that take revenge on unscrupulous men, that too by a woman (in a male dominated society, I did not say that..!) enjoyed every bit of this movie, more and more people must watch this movie so they think twice before attacking a woman
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I love this game HOWEVER it freezes constantly kicks you off the games whip trying to see what goals you have to complete or planting crops and it resets itself ummm yeah not too happy about this at all
0061997811|5.0|I would recommend this product to Potterheads ONLY.<br /><br />This book contains pretty awesome replicas and information about the film from year 1 through 7.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game! it gives you something to do when your bored&bull;&bull;&bull;&bull;&bull;&bull;&bull;&bull;&bull;&bull;&bull;&bull;  if I was a (game teacher) i would give it a a+ I love this game!
B006LSZECO|3.0|Gillian Flynn is a gifted writer with her dry wit and keen insights distilled into perfect little gems strewn throughout her writing.<br />But like so many authors, her good ideas unraveled at the end...or did they. Did she start writing a screen play? Anyway I read it because its been a best seller for months but was disappointed by the unbelievable ending.
B005LJK3AC|5.0|Its a no-brainer have fun movie. Some times the situations look too real especially if you work in the IT field or you work under bosses who are horrible. Watch it, its a real funny movie
B003TJ4YU6|4.0|Having lived through those moments in the early 60's when the Beatles and Rolling Stones came to America, I thought it would be great to see their original performances.  I am very happy with the video, but find the original performances kind of humerous because of some of the stage gaffs like microphones not being at the correct height, and the sound not being fed into the mixer properly.  I had forgotten that Ed Sullivan devoted a large part of three shows in a row just to the Beatles.  Ed really knew how to find talented people for his shows.  I also chuckled about all the times he told the Beatles they were nice and well behaved boys that would make England proud.  Definitely worth watching and adding to your Beatles film collection!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Definitely better than the movie. I plan to read it over the next few days to my children.
B00288KNL8|5.0|It was a classic Tim Burton film. It really didn't get the publicity it deserved. Even though it was marketed toward children, I would say its more pre-teen and up. May be a little scary for younger children.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|face paced secret service investigationn of  terrorirism in the usa.Look forward to reading more of Baldicci&#34;s novels wito download tomy KINDLE
B0000524CY|5.0|Beyond reviews and discussions. Had never seen this version before and truly enjoyed the movie. Still can scare the .... out of you. Must buy
B004EPZ03E|5.0|My daughter loves her chipmunks. My wife and I hate hearing the same movie over and over and over. So we got Chipwrecked for her to watch and to give ourselves a break. This one is pretty good. Different from the other 2. This version also has a sing along. And having some thing else to let her dance, play and sing along is great, being able to accomplish things at home is invaluable. She likes this one better then either of the other 2. And we like something new to hear instead of the same thing.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I enjoyed it a lot.  All of my sisters had read it but me and I wanted a little fun reading it was great funny, sad, and a great ending
B0036EH40Q|5.0|This Blu-Ray has great picture and offers new extra features!  The movie itself it great, a classic even!  I would highly recommend this!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|We LOVE this show.  I definitely recommend it!  But if you haven't seen seasons 1 & 2 you should go back and start there.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|The blu-ray and its digital copy are awesome. Its a masterpiece movie and a movie lovers must have collection. Go for it !
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app it doesn't need wifi and when I need to see when I need to charge it I can press this app and it shows or tells me when I need to charge it. I love this app!!!!!!
B0096C7QF0|5.0|Without a doubt, Joe is one of the best guitarists out there.  On this album, he also proves he can sing with the best of them.<br />For a live album, I think the sound is excellent.  It's not as good as the Blu-ray, but that was 5.1 DTS Surround.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|I bought these for my daughter's room.  They match perfectly with anything else that's Disney Princess!  They come with little jewels to accent the stickers.  They are easy to apply and easy to take off.  They stay on the walls without issue!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is a great game.  I don't know how I got myself to stop.  Amazing.  Sometimes I can get these stupid smiling pigs on the first go and other times I can try 847 times and not get them.  I'm afraid to get started again.  It's been a blast.
B007ZGO7EM|2.0|This is the best calculator app that I have found. I love the fact that you can look back and see all of the computations you have entered in case you think or want to make sure that you haven't made a mistake, or if you forgot where you left off. The best!<br /><br />EDIT: Yes, I love the calculator and I love the fact that you can see what your previous entries are, but the file size just does not justify it. There are others, such as Mobicalc, which is free and is just as useful. You can see what you have entered just like this app, but it the file size is MUCH smaller. If you have a lot of unused memory and don't use many apps, then yes, get this app. If you watch the size of the apps you download and where they go, then I would suggest you look for a different calculator.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|I enjoyed the visit to modern India through the eyes of older English people, the enthusiasm of the young couple, and the comedy, romance, and drama of the story line.
B007M45PMU|5.0|This is a great folk album. I love every song. They remind me of Bob Dylan at some times. Great deal
B0053O89JM|5.0|Bought this as a surprise for my hubby because he is a big House fan.He loves having the whole collection now. Thank you
B0063IH60K|3.0|I know, I know.  It's free.  And that's true.  How can I complain?  But you asked me.  You can rarely play a game to a successful ending.  I can't get the background to change to the color I want.  I do love though, the fact that you can alter it to suit you as a right handed or a left handed player and that is really too cool for school!
B007MU85D0|5.0|I am very picky when it comes to music and I listen to a lot of it. I can count the number of albums of which I like every song on one hand. This is definitely one of those albums.
B002NZTZ8S|4.0|We watched it with our son who is almost three and has an obsession with trains right now.  He loved most of the movie, however there were a few parts where he was a little bit scared.  Overall it is a great family movie and my son is now talking about the &#34;Christmas Train&#34;.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|I love this product and I am glad I rented it.I will eventually buy this product and recommend it to anyone.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Suzanne Collins has bested herself, building upon the world of The Hunger Games, and creating an outstanding and thrilling sequel in the trilogy. A marvelous work of fiction that will have you falling out of your seat with each new twist.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I don't intend on spending my income on a computer game.  I thought it was free.  Every time I want to play, it says I need to buy some kind of coinage.  Not gonna happen.  Sorry.
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|I think every one should read the series and the book its awesome I am only reading it because of a book challenge at my school
1469984202|5.0|I have been searching for a book like this for months now. It keeps you on the edge of your seat, such a page turner, couldn't put it down, twist after twist. It was excellent through and through. So glad I came upon this book! I have recommended it to several friends.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|I was hoping to find an app that would let my son play and not just \\"learn\\" his abc's etc over and over.  He has mastered his alphabet, sometimes kids just want to play!!  This is a great game that lets us sit together and be the doctor and nurse to a whole host of animals that check-in to the hospital.  They leave messes that need to be thrown into trash cans and you can change the bed types they are laying in etc.  It's a great game for young children without being hard to master for little fingers.
B004SKHJF2|5.0|This is the perfect app for identify music, even when people talks and the music is in background.  Awesome app!!
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|I downloaded this book because my daughter wanted to read it so she did and now I still have to read.Thanks Jeff kinney and make some more diary of  a simply kid.
B001AGXEAG|5.0|I got this is an anniversary gift. I wanted the movie so bad, plus the pricing was great! I love this movie. It makes me laugh every time.
B005KDDUVS|5.0|I am very happy to find books in Spanish to download and read on my kindle. It would be great to have sound with Spanish books (have a computer read it to me). This is an excellent way for me to practice Spanish and learn more by reading.
B006SMLAMQ|4.0|The only problem is that, can't refresh the weather, by time you just adjust.  However, I Recommend the App for you.
B00932A2MC|4.0|I love the action and the storyline developement but the ending could have been better.<br />I think Liam Neeson should have had a bigger role
B0052TDGQO|5.0|Bought this for my grandma, and she loved it. It was everything she hoped it would be. Plus pricing was great!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Each episode is better than the last. I would  recommend anyone that can handle flesh eating zombies will love this show!
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|A great movie for a teenager and his or her mother.<br />For me, the moral of the story is: Don't make a decision (an important one especially), when you are angry.<br />Rp
B00AA7O6QC|3.0|There is plenty of action in this movie, but I think that the ending (fight between stallone and jean claude) should have been more action packed and longer
B00992CF6W|5.0|My 8 year old had been wanting this for a while. We got it on our kindle and he is loving it. I would say worth it.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I am a Harry Potter junky! I have read and reread the books, and watched the movies over and over, I was sorry to see it come to an end! Again I am happy with what ever I purchase from Amazon.
B00013M6NK|3.0|If you can't buy a genuine Nikon battery ur out of luck. I didn't love this product. Charge life was marginal
B005EGXTL2|5.0|This book is a fantastic way to finish up on such an amazing story! i would recommend this book to anyone.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Do not open this book unless all prior entries in the saga are part of your past and fully relevant to your future.  Approach only after fully digesting the contents of preceding material, with the characters bonded like old friends, the noble families along with their gods and legends etched in memory, and  the plot twists charted as indelible lessons.  Do not read without sufficient leisure and forged determination to pursue an uninterupted course from page one trough the final words of the epilogue.  If you come expecting resolution you are misinformed; and yet, the worlds within deliver satiation in abundance.  Short of an end, this installment lacks for nothing; and if the exploits of these noble rivals, contentious armies, exotic faiths, local tribes, judicious folk and wandering fools goes on forever, eternity will surely come too soon.  A final word of warning about the dragons - man-eating, fire breathing creatures that consume flesh freshly roasted to a crisp.  Though the full force of their impact has yet to be felt on the tale, their power is much in evidence on pages with edges singed.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|Fun game but it doesn't give me all I need to get to the next level.  Great for a free game.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|You just never know what to expect next from one episode to the next.<br />One of the best shows ever!
B005EGXTHG|5.0|The whole hunger games series is fantastic! I will read them over and over again!<br />Best purchase i've ever made.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|I liked it It was a lot of fun , I think most young men fantasise about running away to the woods: even better with a cute girl.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|It was as expected; not as good as other classic Pixar movies like Toy Story or Up, but still entertaining.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|Great storyline!<br />The wring and direction deserve ultimate recognition.<br />My girlfriend and I love everything about this series.<br />Job very well done!!!
B005EGXTEE|5.0|The detail in this book really sets it up to be a fantastic series.  My favourite book ever right now.
B005LAII0I|5.0|I been looking for this movie. It was a good price. this move came fast. I really like tis move.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book was recommended by a friend to me. I like it lot and recommend it to married couples. The service was very efficient.
B001EC2ISA|5.0|It came sooner than expected & in manufactured packaging, which means it was new just like the discription said it would be.
B009KKLQKO|3.0|i love thae beachboys, anything recent and live by these guys is a rare thing. Only thing that was a bit disapointing was the songlist, needed at least another 10 songs, when i grow up to be a man , forever, god only knows et.. but other then that was great. Hopefully thay will put together another live dvd with everything on it. Keep sufin guys
B008GXHOFW|1.0|this game is a scam it stopped working as soon as I added money to it. I went to by the spider money or what ever its called it took my money and never worked again.
B009AJD5E0|3.0|This movie has beautiful visuals and is somewhat entertaining.  It tries very hard to be deep and contemplative though.  You can see faint whisps of the Blade Runner-esque theme of questioning the definition of humanity.  Also, it plays a bit with the ambiguity between creator and created.  Unfortunately, the depth needed to make these themes meaningful never really materializes.
B0052AKALM|4.0|i love the tekken video games, so this was entertaining to see how some of the characters are handled in a live action movie as opposed to pure animation.<br /><br />if you're NOT a tekken fan, you'll probably be disappointed.  the story line is cliche and most of the filming is too dark to really appreciate some of the details to the martial arts techniques.  also, the fight scenes and moves are very digitally enhanced, so there's probably not much pure martial arts in here to draw fans outside of the video game fan base.
B008JJM88Q|1.0|why would I download this if I can just use it on the Internet for free?WHY? WHY WHY WHY? WHYYYYYYYY?
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I love this CD. I wanted to buy it after I heard their single on the Perks of Being a Wallflower trailer (book holds a special place in my heart). It's so quaintly different. Maybe it's a desert thing...
B008JAGZDE|5.0|This movie is funny. We loved it as we did all American pie movies. Quality was good and had the opportunity to watch it over.
B004V5A7K8|5.0|i haven't tried it on my fire yet, but on the cell phone it's nicely proportioned so that it's easier to pong back to the blocks.  one thing that stood out to me as different from other blocks games was that on the very first fire of the ball it just fires straight up instead of off at an angle even if you slide the slider.  not a big deal, but probably something you'll notice.  good colors and boards
B007X16GFC|5.0|ANY MOVIE WITH MARK WAHLBERG IS GREAT.  HE IS A FANTASTIC ACTOR. I HAVE ALMOST ALL HIS MOVIES I NEED TO UPDATE THO
B009CG2YDE|5.0|Doesn't matter!!! You will love this spiderrific velociraptastic game!!! With the best graphics and sound of any videogame to date, what's not to love??? Beat the rush and infect..err download today!!! RRRARRHH!!!!!!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Fantastic! This is a smart and highly entertaining animated movie! It is very fun and smart and doesn't dumb down anything for kids. As entertaining for adults as it is for kids
B0064BCNA4|2.0|maybe it's because i don't know how to play the piano, but i didn't find this to be very fun - naturally due to the size of the screen you get just a small section of a piano.  the ability to change the sounds was nice, but just didn't seem to work well as an app for the phone due to the size.  this is probably a good app to give to kids in the car to play.
B007R0Y7VO|5.0|I HAD NO IDEA THAT THEY USED HORSES IN THIS WAR, AND THIS HORSE WENT THROUGH SHEER HELL TO DO HIS JOB.
B0055SWM08|5.0|love this game! the graphics are great and each level has just the right mix of easy to hard challenges.
B003UESJFG|5.0|Fantastic! This is a smart and highly entertaining animated movie! It is very fun and smart and doesn't dumb down anything for kids. As entertaining for adults as it is for kids
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|both my mom and i were totally hooked and played this solid for about 2 weeks.  you may first think it's another bejewelled clone, but it's not quite - you end up having to switch the pieces by the end to get them away from bricks that don't break, and there are other pieces that drop down that you can't get rid of with the 3 in a row.  one thing also to note is that the spinner icon on the lower corner of the game - when you blow up 4 or more blocks the spinner will start to glow, when it's full you can use it to blow up random blocks on your board.  don't forget about this feature as it's quite helpful early in the game.  i highly recommend this game, it's fun and requires more strategy than bejewelled.
B00003CXZ1|5.0|Widescreen and complete high definition! So glad I finally got this movie on dvd. Excellent quality. If you're a fan of the film then buy it!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|The Force is strong with this one. The Star Wars version of Angry Birds is great for all fans of the game.
B009DTI4Y8|4.0|This is another release on the Immortal label, similar to sets by Neil Young, Dire Straits, Tom Petty, Eric Clapton, and others.  The sound is fairly crisp and clean, if a little flat and one dimensional, and lacks a bottom end-the bass is lost somewhere in there.  Similar to other sets, the discs snap inside a tri-fold package. Inside is a very bare synopsis of Morrison's music and the songs included.  Similar to other releases, is the lack of band credits, but Morrison shouts out their names during the concert.<br /><br />This concert from 1979, came from the period of albums like \\"Wavelength\\", and \\"Into The Music\\".  But included are songs beginning in Morrison's early days with Them (notably \\"Gloria\\"), and songs on through his solo albums of the late 60's/70's (\\"Brown Eyed Handsome Man\\", \\"Into The Mystic\\", \\"Moondance\\"-listen to Katy Kissoon's vocals, \\"Call Me Up In Dreamland\\", etc.), to then current tunes (\\"Wavelength\\", etc.).<br /><br />His band (sounding great) is perfect for both the material and Morrison.  Many of the band members have played with Morrison for a number of years, and it shows.  There's plenty of horns (listen to the great Pee Wee Ellis), cleanly picked electric guitar, some good keyboard work, and a great rhythm section that lays down a good foundation for Morrison.<br /><br />Highlights are all through this set-\\"Kingdom Hall\\", \\"Into The Mystic\\", \\"You Make Me Feel So Free\\",  \\"Full Force Gale\\", \\"Moondance\\", \\"Wavelength\\", I've Been Working\\", \\"Ain't Nothing You Can Do\\", and so on.  Everyone will find songs here that they feel are high points.  This set may not be as good as the live \\"It's Too Late To Stop Now\\", but some will find it better than \\"A Night In San Fransisco\\"-to each his own.<br /><br />If you're a Morrison fan and haven't heard this (or maybe seen it on DVD), this is definitely worth checking out.  The band plays with a lot of energy and soul, and Morrison is in great voice (and temperament), his almost intuitive, soul filled vocals are just fine.  The combination of soulful arrangements, and Morrison's bluesy, r & b drenched voice make this worth owning.are just fine.  The combination of soulful arrangements, and Morrison's bluesy, r & b drenched voice make this worth owning.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|Summarizing the plot would pretty much spoil the experience for people who haven't seen the movie. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, though.<br /><br />The movie did have a bit of a slow start. There are lots of entertaining treasures on the way as the story builds, though. The movie has lots of humorous moments, but was not without some heart-breaks along the way. Even through the challenging moments, the movie's under-current of hope kept the storyline moving smoothly.<br /><br />With Judi Densch and Maggie Smith in the cast, how could the movie be anything but entertaining?
0783225482|4.0|I love this movie! However I was kind of disappointed when I realized this movie is Full Screen format and not Widescreen. So to watch it on my tv I zoom it in so that it takes up the whole screen without the people looking stubby, but it's not very HD. Besides that the movie is pretty decent quality.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love it. I play so much my energy gets low real quick. I do wish it would give more energy tokens though. but if they did that you wouldn't spend money.
0920668372|1.0|I agree with the other \\"1 star\\" reviews. This book is C-R-E-E-P-Y. \\"Love You Forever\\" could be entitled \\"The Needy Parent\\" or \\"Mama's Boy\\". It's about a mom whose s-mothering love is never-ever-ever ending, even when he becomes an adult he his still treated exactly the same as he was when he was a baby. (Why the hell is she driving over in the middle of the night to crawl into her son's window so she can hold him and sing to him like a baby? Notice no girlfriend or spouse for either of them? Wonder why!) Oh!! And bonus part, throughout the story they apparently only have one another to love...and then mom dies. But the torch is now passed to dad who will s-motherlove his daughter. Eesh. What a happy and fun story, right? Blech, \\"Guess How Much I Love You\\" is way better, non-creepy, fun book about a parent's love.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|My husband & I loved watching this together.  Very well done.  I especially liked that it showed the relationship between John & Abigail, the way he respected & valued her thoughts as well as their friendship.  Brings history to life.
B0083GQ2A0|2.0|I like Liam Neeson movies but this one did not live up to my expectaions of his quality of acting
B008XG1X18|3.0|I have been very disappointed in two different sellers for the same product. I ordered from both and they were both unable to fill my order. It was a gift I really wanted to give my daughter, but as of yet I have not found it. I am going to try and make my own.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Great film about young love, family, death, and most of all adventure. The main characters were written perfectly with their own strange issues and lovable qualities. Wonderful cast with some of my favorite actors.
B008I43DYU|4.0|Easy to use as a basic calculator. I mainly use it for simple tasks. Good to have in the house for easy access.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I put this on my kindle for my grandkids and they loved it , it gave them something to do and it was fun for them
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Its my husband and i's date night..so we choose to watch sons  of anarchy. Its a great show and i would recommend it to my friends
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Amazing episode, it was probably the very best episode of this show so far. The acting was up to par and it had an ending that had you on edge.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this show, can't wait for the rest of the episodes to come out to I can see them .
B005UDD1R6|2.0|Keeps crashing and doesn't recognize files sometimes. I've had to reinstall it for it to pick up files. Aggravating. They need to fix this ASAP.
B000M5NRLC|5.0|my boys loved it..Its a great family movie and me and my boys watch it for family time. Its one of the christmas movies you have to watch every year
B009HV2JT8|4.0|I enjoyed the use of real history plots involved in the movie.Plus it has Vampires so how could it go wrong?
B000VBIGD6|5.0|i use to watch it all ta time when i was younger great lv it lv lv lv funny lv
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|fantastic game. got me playing for hours. it is just a tad bit short so please make more levels but other than that 5 stars all the way. basically what im saying is Rovio, you have outdone yourself again
B00000JMOF|5.0|Boris Karloff is outstanding as the monster is this original classic monster movie. This is the movie that set the standard for all other monster movies to come. Still a pleasure to watch, and even better with this 75th anniversary edition.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|As usual, she had me going to the end!  She really gets her descriptions in so well, that one seems as though they are truly right there in the action.  I can almost &#34;smell&#34; the room in which she works on those bodies.  I don't know how those people can do it.  They truly do speak for the dead!  I love her books and am looking forward to her next one.
B0013FSL3E|3.0|i didnt watch it yey the kids watched it n wanted me to bye it so i did they said it was good
0143035711|5.0|This is a well written work.  I enjoyed the perspective of a pilot, and like all the topics: flying mechanics; combat; psychological impacts of war.  Good for me trying to get a flavor of the war.
B000035Z3K|5.0|Bela Lugosi reigns supreme in this dark classic movie rendition of Bram Stoker's novel Dracula. A fine 75th anniversary edition DVD that is sure to be the star of any classic horror movie collction.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is my wife and I's favorite show.  This is the best season so far.  Its hard to wait a week to see a new episode.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|i watched i have n old vcr one n i wanted to have it 4 the kids to watch lv it funny
B008YZ4RR0|5.0|I know I'm prejudiced and just plain like Tom Selleck, but I really think that Selleck has hit a certain stride with these Jesse Stone movies.  I've liked every one of them, and some of them are very memorable and worth re-watching.  To me, one of the most important things about a movie series like this is creating and maintaining a certain atmosphere, and these films definitely have a characteristic and distinctive atmosphere.  Part of it is accomplished by the cinematography and by the consistent feel of the New England setting.  Part of it is by the consistent set of supporting characters, all played nicely by good actors.  But much of it is simply created by Selleck himself.<br /><br />Sometimes I think that Jesse Stone is what Thomas Magnum might have been like -- grown up and sobered by having had life smack him in the face.  A bit cynical, but  only because he is a sensitive soul who has been wounded.  And in spite of being jaded, still holding on to something he knows how to do -- finding out the truth and trying to do the right thing.
B008458O3S|5.0|Trainyard is a near perfect puzzle game. If you like slow games that test your brain, you've found a real gem. There's not much I didn't like about Trainyard. Every now and then your touch is not fully recognized, but try it a second time and it works!<br /><br />Other than that it's a great game. The levels start incredibly easy, but get progressively harder. Yet the game never leaves you completely in the dark. Mini tutorials introduce new elements, and if you're really stuck with a level, just paying attention to its name usually helps a lot!<br /><br />All in all the game gave me lots of brain-teasing fun for a really small amount of money! Well done!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|awesome calculator easy to use love the big numbers I go to it daily would recommend it to everyone to use
B000AGTPUU|5.0|i did watched it n i lv it it is really good 4 kids n ta kids lv itlv it
B00992CF6W|5.0|First your pc, then your xbox, now your kindle fire! minecraft is a very fun game, yes it not like the pc or xbox cuz it on your phone! have fun! :)
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this. very simple to learn, and addicting with hours and hours of play. great for brain exercises or casual play.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Simpler than a real board game of Mahjong, but a fun way to pass time.  I've got to turn off all the sounds though.  A hospital waiting room doesn't need all the hiccup noises!
B00447L4JG|4.0|i watched alittle of it it seened good i have to watch more of it so then i can really say what if
B005LAIHZE|4.0|I liked this movie because of the action, special effects, and, even though in the completely unreal setting of vampire hunting, I like the way that Lincoln comes across.  The characters and the story line drew me in.  If you like something that is a little off beat, this is a movie to see.
B009O2XY12|5.0|Addictive....so don't start if you don't have the time. Great fun to pass the time. We loved it and the grandkids loved it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I even won the second game I played.  Only had the game for 2 days, so not much time with it yet.  It'll be good in waiting rooms.
B001AGXEAG|5.0|great we didnt watch yet but i have vca too so i no the picture good lv it lv it lv it
B00846REIS|5.0|This trilogy absolutely holds its own!  I can't get enough of it, since this is the 3rd time reading it.  I am waiting for the 3rd book on the edge of my seat.  I seriously hope that it is here before May and that #3 is not rushed, even if it means I have to wait for a 4th book.<br />If anyone is looking for even more books to enjoy while waiting for this one to finish or for the hopeful more to come with 50,  I have to say the the \\"Masters at Arms - Rescue Me Series\\" or the \\"Mackenzie Brothers\\" series is just as good to hold you over in the wait!
B009D5VNLS|5.0|It was hilarious for adults and children alike and with a compelling story. The sole purpose of her life was not to get married.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I'm an old lady and I haven't cleared the first stage in any season yet.  That is the aggravating part.  Got to figure out how to turn off the pigs.  The noise in a waiting room would be the pits.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I loved this book.  I did cry a lot during certain portions of the book but still found it to be very entertaining.  I thought the whole story was very well written.  I would definitely recommend it to all of my friends.  Just make sure you have tissues close by.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Love love love the whole trilogy!  I wish there were more books to follow. I guess I will have to settle for the other two movies!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Great Angry Birds game. Graphics look great on my kindle fire. Its a fun way to fill time throughout the day.
B005HSG3U6|3.0|It filled the requirement of not being  expensive.  The stand is not very sturdy, but is mostly adequate.  The case does protect the tablet and is easy to use.  It'll be quite some time before I would be inclined to upgrade the case.
B000I9VZJ8|1.0|...but this was one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen.  Stupid stupid stupid!  Do not waste  your money.
B004NSULHM|5.0|I love everything by Radiohead, and I consider 'Bloom' to be their greatest, though all their work encompasses a coherant whole.  &#34;Bloom&#34; is like a hymn to me, a blessing to the beginning of the day or a hymn to the sea.  Yorke has always been like a 'pied piper' to me -- his voice just rises off the Earth, and takes you with it if you're listening carefully.  The whole CD is wonderful, and 'Lotus' is another outstanding single that I would have bought an entire CD to obtain.  i.e., 'let me count the ways.'
B000JD1CEQ|5.0|Ive not recieved the one I thought I bought but watched on instant video. Ecellent movie, I recommend it for everybody.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|So so so good. I wanted more and more. Towards the end I paced myself and only allowed so many pages a night so it would last. I love these kinds of stories. It makes you think about how many!!! lives we each touch. KING DOES IT AGAIN
B00A8ECU24|3.0|not really bad very cute game. would be a little more fun if itnwas not so farmvillie. its just farmville with ponys
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I love angry birds and this one is a great addition to the series. Love the new birds and how it goes along the star wars storyline.
B0048IMZMG|5.0|Love all of her music, and it's hard to beat a whole album for $3.99!  Our entire family loves Taylor's music!
B005LAIHZE|4.0|Dont pay this much.<br /><br />Oh yeah....its a good movie. There was alot of action. The only thing i didnt like was there was waaaaaay too much slo-mo (think The Matrix), it got really annoying.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this book about a week before the movie came out and it is my absolute favorite. I resisted when I had to put it down! The writing makes you feel that you are Katniss herself and you feel as cool as she is! You feel hver pain and cry with her. You feel her strength and think you have it too. The romance that is put in is perfect and the action and twists keep you holding your breath on the edge of your seat. I will read it anytime, or any book in the trilogy.
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|Was enjoyable to watch along with the kids. The plot was the typical disney princess getting in trouble and it all works out in the end.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|breaks the boredom of the day and very addicting, great game to play wish the walls would stay up a little longer. know other complaints.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|This book is definitely riding the coat tails of the 50 trilogy.  But if your looking for something to do after Christian Grey this will do.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|its awesome<br />@ and if ur reading this u should read the book too hi hi hi hi hi hi
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved this book because the author goes back and forth between the 2 main characters - the husband and the wife. The premise is that the wife is missing and maybe the husband killed her....you find yourself asking that question for quite a long time. I think that thing I liked best about this book is that everyone is for lack of a better word &#34;f'ed up&#34;. There are no perfect characters. This is a great twisting story that keeps you guessing right up until the end. I can see why it was the &#34;it&#34; book of 2011. Def recommend!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved to characters and the story line.  Would and have definitely recommended it!!  Wonder how the movie would look!!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love the fact that they do not worry about you getting attached to any of the main characters... Kill'm all and start over.... Keep it fresh and keep it real....
B008GXHOFW|5.0|Its a great game but like eveyone else says it will restart when it wants to beside that free roam is great and i played it all day and unlocked the black suit (Black suit looks like its from spider man 3)
B004ZN9RWK|4.0|It brings back memories...and again, Pink Floyd is an Icon from my era.  My tastes in music aren't  encumbered with what others think I should listen to so I was always open to good music.....all kinds.  Like this.
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved to characters and the story line,  Can't wait for the final book to be released.  Would definitely recommend it!!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|If you watched the T.V show well you need to read the book also because it's where the true story lies and it's even better and descriptive.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This is one of my favorite English movies.  Right up there with Enchanted April and Easy Virtue.  The two Dames were royal.
B009YU62H2|4.0|It is new Soundgarden and after a long absense I will take what I can get. Chris sounds great and the music is new, I would have to say the main downfall is the amount of experimental sound that usally would come through is not there in my opinion. Still glad to have new music.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved to characters and the story line,  Can't wait for the final book to be released.  Would definitely recommend it!!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Great app.. I use it all the time. Easy to use  and never have to worry about losing data.  Keep up the great work.
B008WCP2PG|1.0|This was the most disgusting movie I have ever started to watch.  I saw 15 minutes and took it out of the player and tossed it in the trash.  So far below McCoughney's talent as a romatic/comedy lead.  He is one of my favorite actors and I am just so disappointed.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I love this series, but wish that they would cut back on the extreme, bloody gore. It seems so dehumanizing - even though we're talking zombies here, lol. The characters are great and the plot line is super, but the gore makes me cringe and doesn't add anything to the series except shock value.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved to characters and the story line.  Would and have definitely recommended it!!  Wonder how the movie would look!!!
B0063GORYU|3.0|I like playing it on the big screen on my computer but in the mobile form it is not as easy to play.
0525952926|5.0|Coudn't wait for this book.  Ordered it for my husband.  Great price, great to be able to pre order. I didn't read it, but my husband loved it.
B004EHZDE8|5.0|Much of the advice offered in this book is common sense, however it's presented in such a way that sheds light on situations which might not be abundantly obvious.<br /><br />Feibelman also offers a unique insight into working in research institutions, and offers some valuable advice as to how to young researchers should set up their careers for success. The book covers many important topics, and is well presented and insightful and should become the \\"go to\\" reference book for young scientists out there.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to anybody who is looking to start a PhD and begin a career in research.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved to characters and the story line.  Would and have definitely recommended it!!  Wonder how the movie would look!!!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|great spatial puzzles. lots of fun.  could use more free hints for when the player gets stuck. fun for all ages
B005QUQP76|1.0|This is a great mouse, especially for the price.  But it has one serious flaw that has me regretting the purchase.  The bottom of the mouse is metal and has completely scratched my desk.  I then bought a hard plastic Razer mouse pad and it too has become completely scratched by the mouse.  I have never had a mouse scratch my desk or mouse pad before.  For this reason alone, I do not recommend the mouse.  I have used the mouse for about 6 months.
B0098460O4|5.0|This is the most amazing cd.  I love every song and am simply blown away by their voices.  Jonathan is phenomenal.  I've listened to it several times a day since I bought it.  You won't be disappointed - you'll be thrilled.
0345525558|5.0|I agree with an earlier reviewer that this title doesn't do the novel justice. I thought I was going to find something syrupy. But I couldn't have been more wrong. The author's writing is beautiful and clean, so much so that you become immersed in the characters without noticing the word crafting much (a sign of fantastic writing, I think).<br /><br />This story reminds me of an Oprah book of yore with the down-and-out young woman who'd been lost in the foster family/court system. As she moved through childhood and young adulthood she was afraid to connect with anyone. Yes, it could be a little frustrating watching her rebuff love and help, but I thought the author showed very well how wounded Victoria was and WHY she was so afraid to let her weaknesses show.<br /><br />The Language of Flowers is one of the best books I've read this year.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|Laughter from beginning to end... I laughed out loud practically thru this whole thing. I think just about anyone can find something in this movie they can relate to. If you like the &#34;Vacation&#34; movies with the Griswold clan...you'll love this one! Enjoy!
B009SQRL4U|4.0|This is a good family movie, with lots of humor or both kids and adults.  Unfortunately, the dialogue goes very quickly and is a little difficult to follow.  If it weren't for that, I'd give it 5 stars.
0140120416|5.0|Finding it explains things simply enough not to confuse learners, goes through what you need to develop basic skills speaking the language, am really enjoying this book, and have learned a lot in next no time.
B008J34466|5.0|As a fan of her music. I really enjoyed this Cd. She is definantly a rock star in my book. :)
B00913DPW2|4.0|Game wasn't too easy or too hard. Would have given 5 stars except some of the puzzles were a little frustrating. Will probably get The Haunt 2.
B005PK553C|5.0|Exellent story and writing. Very creapy stuff. It might be hard to watch for you if you don't like seeing people living through harsh situations.
B000065V42|5.0|Even though this movie has been around a long time, it is being enjoyed all over again by a new generation. They love that the kids get shrunk, and the adventure of getting from the back yard into the house to be brought back to life size. Really fun movie. Should be in everyone's movie collection.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This has got to be one of the best books I've ever read, the characters spring to life in mind & set the stage for a beautiful story. E L James, I applaud you & certainly hope to see more from these<br />Characters. I recommend this to everyone wanting to dive into a story that will leave you breathless, on the edge of your seat and definitely wanting more!
B009B2VBWE|5.0|Everything from Diana Krall is outstanding! Rag doll is no different. This is a worthwhile buy to add to your collection.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Anyone who say's this ins't a prequil isn't paying attention. This is the best Alien movie sense the first two and it really expands the univers while leaving you asking so many questions that it is mandatory that you watch it several times. Great flick!
B0044XRIMW|5.0|This movie is a classic and should be in everyone's movie collection. The story is interesting, moving and<br />inspiring. Have seen it so many times, that we know all the songs (and probably all of the dialogue, too!). Love this movie.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Since reading 50 Shades, I am always in such of the next great story.  This book immediately started playing out in my head.  If you've read Taking Chances, this is very similar.  I am waiting for the next book to come out.  I could see this being made into a movie
B003TJR2HS|5.0|I purchased two of the CableJives so that I could charge my iPod and Iphone without having to remove them from their cases. The product has worked flawlessly. Would highly recommend!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Most exelent season. Totally makes up for being 'trapped' on the farm last season. Good story flow and development of the charicters.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|the controls are intuitive and, the game is fun combos are easy. should be able to shop more with silver coins.
B0063B2BNE|5.0|you really can't go wrong with such and awesome show!!  temperence and booth the new hot couple for our time
B000O8OTNC|4.0|very ezy to use and does the job. It can be a little small and couldnt use it on the axe but great for the knives.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|I really would enjoy it if the companies would at least give some credit to mojang. I can seriously find more than twelve similarities in the first few lines of the main engine code. tis also worse than minecraft trial version which just deprives you of multiplayer.<br /><br />Also. this &quot;game&quot; sucks. Be warned friends!
B0000DIXDR|5.0|This is one of my all time favorites and a must have. I am proud to say that I own this and will have a lot of usage out of it. can't recommend highly enough.
B008BME7QM|5.0|this is one of those movies that lifts your spirits when you are down, unless your spirits are crushed bt a girl named Fiona, then maybe not so much!
B008NW67E0|5.0|This CD is everybit as good as their last CD, if not better! There is not 1 single song that I don't like! I can't wait to see what they come up w/ next! Highly recommended!!!!
B008SLAXGO|5.0|I love this book every little monster needs this for their mother monster collection ;)  has some of the best pictures and moat personal pictures really makes you feel like you know her
B007SPPANM|5.0|I remember when this came out. I loved it then and now I still love it and it takes quite alot to interest me. This is one film that everyone has to see.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I recommend this book to anyone who wants to feel better, shed pounds, and think with a clear mind. Becky from The Villages, FL
B009JZTOG8|5.0|it is an asome series with action fantasy adventure in one it is an asome adventure abc out did its self.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|its a good book lots of people would like buy it now.Greg wants to get a girl right ? wrong he doesnt want to be left out
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Great book for anyone but I would think especially good for anyone who works with those with Alzheimer's or has a family member with any type of dementia.
B002T66IHC|5.0|This will be a classic! I hope tswift goes back to her roots after Red and makes more albums like Fearless!
B009RI4FRU|5.0|A very touching story of young love, first love really. Although the two adolescents are quirky and don't set the best example, they seem to be very compatible. And, their adventures are quite entertaining. Excellent casting on both the stars, but also the extensive supporting cast.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love playing Bingo. It's fun , fustrating.and challenging but also relaxing. I could play Bingo all day long.I would recomend this game to everyone.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Keeps your attention and is a good read.  I really did not like the ending.  I would recommend it to others or as a book club read.
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|I love Rebus despite all his faults and it was great to be involved with this renegade character again.<br />An intriguing story, well drawn characters and marvellous descriptions which make you feel as if you are there all add up to a super read.
B009CG2YDE|4.0|This is truely a classic retro style game. I would definitely recommend this game to those who like galaga and space invaders style games.
B0087DFIOU|4.0|Mel Gibson was (is?) on the outs with mainline Hollywood and had to partially fund this movie only not to be able to get distribution. Too bad. This would have looking good on a 50 ft cineplex screen. Get the Gringo is a good Saturday afternoon popcorn movie. It's a good story and has lots of action. The extra features are ok.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|First the game Flow, then Flower, and now Journey; I'm blown away by That Game Company's last creation. Most games are shoot em up, RPG with Dungeon quests, or linear Jump games where you collect points.<br /><br />This game is both creative and a work of art plus the music score is brilliant. Like many, I thought it might be boring or not challenging. In the traditional sense of games, it is not what you would ever expect. You are paired with another anonymous player. No names are exchanged or words, you simply communicate by a series of chimes or chirps.<br /><br />Most of us look for the goal or point in a game, so might miss the experience of this game. I challenge you, if you have read this far to buy the game and then \\"let go\\" to just exploring this world. There are symbols and glyphs to collect at each level, that will help the player earn the coveted White Robe. But you are not required to collect them, if you just want to experience the game and move through each scene until the end.<br /><br />Now the part that is surreal about this game. You tend to develop a bond with the other player, you are Journeying with through the game. After a while you begin to help each other, play together, and stick together through the difficult areas of the game. Yes, there is endless dessert, but also a water tower, sliding sand gate area, a bridge you need to build to progress, and more. Towards the end of the game, when you and your companion \\"die\\" in the snow area, most players are genuinely moved.<br /><br />Don't be fooled when you \\"die\\" in the snow area, there is more to game and you need to wait out a short period of darkness. Anyway, I won't give away any more about the game or experience. But I will tell you that many players have been moved to laughter, tears, and even feel a connection to a higher power. I've been playing video games since Pong and this is by far the best one yet. Rumor has it, That Game Company is working on another game for release. Can't wait to see if they  can surpass Journey. It will not be easy to do.to see if they  can surpass Journey. It will not be easy to do.
0307341577|5.0|In addition to the very creative story, the main character is well-developed and not a cliche.  I could not put it down.
B003V1WXKU|4.0|&#34;Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!&#34; is well written; funny, exciting, science, cultural, internal, and memorable.  I think it is a book for the age of 15 and above.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|Am a huge KW fan after seeing her in this and The Reader. Never heard of Leonardo DiCaprio until this movie and he really came into his own in Blood Diamond. Titanic is part chick flick and action movie and does both well. I've seen Titanic at least ten times and it just endures. James Cameron did great with the this movie, but he remains a leftist whack job. His politics aside, his commentary during the movie is first rate. The tons of extra features are worth the cost of the BD itself.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Cute Game. I love the my little ponies ever since I was a kid. I like the game also and I like playing it too.
B009FZFONO|5.0|this season is starting out intense...a lot more action than the second season but still has dramatic and heartfelt moments...so far so good guys
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|My kids and I love this game, the characters are funny and really take me back to the movie. Family fun
B009YU6FJM|5.0|I'll keep it short; this album is fantastic. I've been a huge deftones fan ever since Around The Fur came out in 97, and with this album they continue to remain one of my only &#34;favorite bands&#34; that hasn't once put out a disappointing album. What they're doing so well in this album (& also with &#34;Diamond Eyes&#34;) is a killer contrast between beautiful, ambient vocals & sound-scapes/synth noises with just a totally crushing guitar tone. I love how their sound is evolving as they get older. As some of the previous reviews have mentioned, this is probably/possibley Chino's strongest vocal peformance yet. It's just a great album. Not a true &#34;throw-away&#34; track anywhere on it, haven't been able to stop listening to 4 or 5 of them constantly since I downloaded it a week ago. 5 stars.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Christmas classic.  in Blu Ray is amazing.  I was very excited to see how inexpensive it was duing Black Friday
B003ASLJK4|5.0|I bought this for my grandparents and they love it!! They do not have a huge collection of BluRays so I thought this would make a great addition and my grandma was happy with the quality. So they did a great job with the transfer to bluray.
B008EQIEWS|3.0|Story is solid and special effects are great; dialogue is awkward at times, but overall this is a good &#34;movie night&#34; at home with friends and family flick. So get the popcorn and sweets and enjoy!
B0058YPG1G|5.0|this was a bday gift for my bf and he absolutely loved it. it came early and was brand new
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm addicted to this app, its so amazing. I would give it millions of stars! RECOMMENDED! I LOVE THIS! Get this app. Its free even!
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie was great. Never as good as the book of course. Got it for my 13 yr old son.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|It was great to be able to order the DVD and receive a free video online. Great deal! Great service!
B002361MLA|4.0|This book made me think again about how to embrace what \\"is\\". I recommend this book to those who are searching for peace. It is difficult to live unconsciously and I strive to move out of fear and anxiety.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|I love it because it gives a challenge and it is fun. the controls are easy to learn and the grafics are okay to. the only downside is that the webs don't actually attatch to anything but you still swing.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My 4 yr old has been talking about this movie ever since he saw it. My 13 yr old loves the soundtrack.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|I hate games that require me to have facebook a social media that steals your information, is easily hackable and ruins friendships because of it
B002PZ1H6E|5.0|Makes me want to grab a plane to the Lake District and start a glorious walkabout!  Do you think I could meet Peter?
B001E45XT4|5.0|These headphones have served me well for the past 6 months and I do recommend them to anyone looking for a good but cheap set of headphones. The mic sounds wonderful, and the sound quality is great. They are not noise cancelling, but they do block out a good amount of sound.
B0092C2X7U|5.0|I love this game. I can not put it down. I love free play mode. I would reccomend this game to anyone
B004BEMC6G|4.0|I like this movie because of the plot. It's one of those movies where you really need to pay attention to detail. I think they did an awesome job on Jolie's character and she did an awesome job playing. If you are looking for a physiological thriller this is you're movie.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|I love my Kindle and I use it all the time, but I need it to be comfortable in my hand. This is the best case I've found. It's light weight, closes easily, it's snug, and hard enough to really protect my Kindle.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|This movie is adorable. The streaming quality looked great on my computer, and I bet it would be fine going from a computer to a TV. I recommend watching this movie with your children, not only will they enjoy it but so will you.
B009CG2YDE|5.0|the game reminds me of a old retro game. it was one of the best games I ever played :D. plus I don't know its now that instead of a space ship.
B009PU2SX8|4.0|I even live near Austin so it makes no sense.  I bought the album for the song Numb because it has a Black Keys feel to it (which I love)... it turned out to be one of the most bipolar albums I've ever heard.  But I totally dig it... has the feel of Prince, to Lenny Kravitz to some real rockin blues... Totally different sound from one song to the next...  It's in heavy rotation on my pod.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|story is in line with the book so would say they did a good job making it to a film. cant wait for part two!
B009329Y30|4.0|Not a new formula as far as plots go, but some interesting twists and turns in getting there. Worth your time!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Can keep you entertained forever! The only problem is that it doesn't update ever! Is this Amazon or Mojang's fault? Either way, great game.
B007PBKG5G|4.0|I'd wanted the album for a while after hearing Hold On and finally made the purchase after a coworker friend vouched for it.  Totally glad I bought it... she's got an amazing voice... and I love their sound.
B004UID2LC|5.0|my friend told me about this and it did what i expected! would recommend this app to everyone i know!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I enjoy this game. It is quick to play and challenging without being too difficult. It is a good time filler if you don't have a lot of time.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I was so excited for the release of the second book in the Century Trilogy and was not disappointed.  Like the second book the characters captured my heart and their tribulations, triumphs and relationships kept me on the edge of my seat.  I loved this!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Enjoyable, easy at 1st but don't be fooled. Once you get in a few levels it becomes difficult but yet still fun. Would recommend to others.
B00063EMJ6|5.0|Every tune that established him as a major artist.  Cinnamon girl, Old Man, Cowgirl in the Sand. What more is there to say.
B009GEBBNQ|2.0|Full of exciting action, but I didn't care about it at all. I couldn't wait until it was over. Glad I didn't waste $25 going to see it in a movie theater. Save yourself $2 and wait till it's on TV.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book grabbed me from the first line with its unpredictable plot and well-developed characters.  It prompts questions about what a good marriage is and how relationships can change.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I love the Big Bang Theory and could never give an unbiased assessment of its merits. Each episode is like a comedy/sci-fi &#34;fix&#34; for me. I'm a humor loving nerd. What can I say? If you love the previous seasons, this one will not disappoint.
B009CG2YDE|4.0|I was skeptical but enjoyed it. reminded me of a spiced up space invaders. Retro music was cool too. :)
B008KE3960|5.0|Once you get the hang of giving each plane a good pattern to follow and have enough planes to get the job done, its fun to create the ultimate kill zone!  The combo of the freeze weapon and bombs are very efficient placed where the enemy starts its runs.
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|Move the Twilight saga to the east coast and Europe with older (but not necessarily wiser) characters and substitute witches for werewolves seems to be the formula for this book. There was just enough humor along with plot twists to to keep me reading.
0786891416|4.0|fun and exciting... I have to say i loved the show, Castle, and although i love those kinds of shows i'm not a big fan of mystery novels... but i loved this book and for a lot of reasons cause it does sound like Castle from the show... and you can see bits of the characters and even lines he would've been inspired by Kate Beckett to write... it was definitely a tangled web... i never saw the ending coming even when it got there... there was always something happening and new leads to follow and a bit of romance to spice it all up... i say if you like the show or just like mystery novels you definitely should check this book out...
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|BRAVE the movie is an excellent family movie, the picture quality is highand the story is simple, just for younger kids.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book started off strong but wasn't able to pull it all together in the end. I had a hard time buying into the plausibility of events and the main characters are completely unlikable.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game,  the update is pretty weird but I still love it. Highly reccomend this app. Great time killer.
B0043JDUNS|5.0|Excellent Marvel movie! Robert Downey Jr has definitely resurrected his career. Scarlet looks great as usual! Looking forward to Iron Man 3!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|The quality of the rental was very good, despite being streamed online.  The audio was spot on, and there were no cuts in the graphics.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|[ rarely watch television but have really enjoyed the walking dead,there is actually a story line. Alot of Zombie movies don't have a plot.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|It is a nice game. With all the features, birds, and pigs that you would want without cost.<br />This game is adicting, repetative, and a bit frustrating at times. But it is still a great game, to play over time.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I like to read stories of the past. Slavery and indentured servants always interests me. This story, done in narrative of several of the characters, gives an enlightening view of the times of that era.  There are some sad and heart breaking things that happen but the spirit and love of these characters will stay with you.
B0098460O4|5.0|Excellent in everyway--beautiful--Charlotte also has an outstanding voice not just Jonathan--I buy 3 and intend to buy more for Christmas pesents.<br /><br />You will love this album of great vocals.
0316228532|2.0|O.K. Count me as yet another reader who happened to enjoy the whole Harry Potter thing, but this one is a doozie of a bore. J.K. couldn't be more pedestrian now that she's decided to come down to the grim world most of us inhabit. Makes you wonder why she decided to become so darned dull.<br /><br />Perhaps its time for something new and exciting. Try CLARIE ANGE--a hilarious, truly engaging read, flecked with depth and goose-bumpy wonder. (Move over, J.K. and meet M.A. Kirkwood).
B005WYFLNU|5.0|The kids loved them. Only complaint were some of the stickers were difficult to take off the page. I would buy them again
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I don't think we can categorize this book.<br />It is unusual, takes your heart, makes you dream, transform you and leave you wanting more.<br />The descriptives are so clear that you can not only feel the fabrics and hear them ruffle but you can also smell the entire circus around them. The characters are complex and so humans that we can feel their heartbeat and their dreams come and go.<br />One of my favorite book this last year.
B001QJUX24|5.0|I first viewed this film on TV when I was about fourteen years old and it has mesmerized me ever since.  IMHO this is the greatest motion picture ever made.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This was an excellent book. I have recommended it to my friends and family, and those who took the time to read it all loved it as much as I did.<br /><br />The detail Harkness weaves into the story enhanced the book for me. The characters are easy to empathize with as you are discovering the world along with the protagonist. Diana is a strong, accomplished, female lead, which I found very refreshing. I am really looking forward to the third installment.
B00979CS50|5.0|I really like the new music! sounds like the old stuff too!Neil Young and Crazy Horse still do rock! really sounds good Loud!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I am a mystery fan and this show captured my attention right off.  The Sherlock character is witty, dry, and insulting, in part because he doesn't want to take the time to be nice.  Watson provides insight, often to Sherlock's surprise, and keeps him in check.
B0083P1QUM|2.0|This book was boring and meandering.  The story was weak and the ending was a bit of a &#34;who cares who did it by now&#34;.  There was a tremendous amount of unnecessary detail, which I believe was meant to mislead and misdirect, but didn't lead anywhere except to add more pages.  Some of the seemingly new twists involving the standard cast of characters were never developed or explored.  This was not one of Ms. Cornwell's best efforts.
1449410243|5.0|I loved every page of this book! It has enough new material (not yet available online) to make the purchase worth it.
B007N85ZXY|5.0|I like to new words to the old songs! specially This land is my Land this land is your land!
B009VLXMJA|5.0|I find downloads from Amazon to be fast and easy, and I'm loving the music on Taylor's new album too. For those two reasons, I'm giving this 5 stars!
B00AA7O22U|5.0|LOVE this movie. All the greats in one movie! Losts of action..hop theres a III in the works! Like the see Steven Segal in the next one!
B0060FXDCG|3.0|All of the discs come in good condition but the third movies' case was broke and cracked all over beyond repair so that was kind of disappointing other than that everything else was good
B008CPRLP2|5.0|I find I can do just about everything on my smartphone, but zipped attachments would not open. I often receive business files in this format and could not review them on the go. This app solved the problem and I am so pleased with it. Files are unzipped and displayed without a hitch.
044042335X|3.0|I'll start off by saying that I am a huge Lee Child/Jack Reacher fan; I've read about two-thirds of the books so far and my mission is to finish reading the rest in the next few months. This particular story happens to be my least favorite. First, there were a couple things wrong (or at least, very unbelievable) from a technology stand-point, like the whole security set-up with the USB memory sticks, and a shoulder-launched weapon being able to climb 80,000 feet. The prose also wasn't what I expected from a Jack Reacher novel; it seemed very sparse, not a lot of the great similes and descriptions found in previous works. In fact, I had the feeling about a quarter of the way into it that Mr. Child must have had someone write this novel for him, because it seemed very uncharacteristic of his writing.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|I had heard of this movie but brushed it off as some possibly cheesy story.  Instead, I got a really great science fiction saga.  Timothy Olyphant is what drew me to this and he did not disappoint.  Great story, great cast, and I find myself hoping there is a sequel to this film!!! I've never read the book, but I'll surely be picking it up and hoping the author continues the story!
B002QRWJA4|5.0|I watched this movie several years ago, and it has become one of my favorites!! The music gets captured in your soul and I find myself singing it frequently. I even bought the soundtrack so I can listen in the car and it is one of my favorites while cleaning the house. If you have a good sound system...crank it up!! Gerard Butler has such a wonderful rock and roll voice and brings a great edge to the phantom...and Emmy Rossum has the voice of an Angel.  I hope you enjoy this as much as I did!
B005IQZB14|3.0|Cheryl's struggle with the death of her mother was very challenging for her, which many can relate to. But I was disappointed with the fact even though she was on a beautiful trail (with very little mentioning of what she was seeing in the beauty of it)  I expected the trail in her writing ,to help her find direction, to inspire  her to look forward in dealing with her problems. Instead, her hike really didn't answered all her problems, nor really gave her direction.  Physically she overcame the hike, but emotionally did she make it?
B007FG9LIE|4.0|At first I thought the book was going to be formulaic, but it's definitely not.  Well written and suspenseful, but I'm not sure I bought into the ending.  I don't want to give it away.  It's a quick and easy read, though, so I'd recommend it.  You can ponder the ending on your own!
B004GYY714|5.0|Great app! It provides different radio stations many country, in different languages. It contains the radio station in my country, in my city. Five star app.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I love this movie.  Fantasy, happy endings, comedy, and a lesson.  Good for young girls just exhibiting rebellion.  I'm 55 years old, but the kid in me is alive and well.  I tend to be nonobjective when it comes to Disney and Pixar animations.  I don't think I have seen two or three I didn't like.  It brings back the wonder and excitement of a full, wonderful life ahead, where it's possible to achieve most anything, and be the master of your fate.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|This story, familiar to us all, told to us or seen via movies or TV becomes alive through the written word. Dickens is a master story teller.
0026009102|4.0|I decided to read The Fountainhead as I believe it was written before Atlas Shrugged.  I like it as read at night after I am in bed and before I go to sleep. It is the kind of book I look forward to on my nightly visit and the plot is complicated enough that you get a good read in a couple of chapters a nd then can put it down and look forward to the next evenings read.  It is long so you don't get tempted to just read on and finish it.  It is perfect for me and my reading habits.  I will hate it to end although then I do move on to Atlas.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Great story line. Perfect for moms and their little girls. Boys will love it as well. Great action for dads.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Addicted to this show from the get go! I can't wait for Season 3 to start, love me some Harvey and Louis!!!
B001DCZ4IW|2.0|I really could not get into this story. I don't really like &#34;dark&#34; comedy, so unless that is what you are into, this movie is probably not for you.
1569242739|3.0|Really good if you plan to do a lot of baking.  Well worth the money and easy to follow the recipes.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is fun, simple, and free. the basic premise is run and dodge and slide and jump to get coins and the highest score you can.<br /><br />coins come at you quickly enough that i have never felt pressure to buy any at their online store, bit slowly enough that i have to do several runs in order to continue upgrading. Its the perfext mix for me.<br /><br />It seems as thoigh this game never ends, but that's ok, its fun running from those ugly monkeys.<br /><br />if you want a simple, addictive &quot;only have a few minutes to play&quot; games, this one is perfect.<br /><br />On another note, the tutorial is exceesingly sufficient and the game is not difficult to learn. Good lick mastering it though.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|It is soooo fun especial when you slide on the car door and when you swing on a spider web.
B002PEP4U0|5.0|We read this book at my church to get us aquainted  with the people from Malawi. It gave me some insight on to the culture.
1439153663|3.0|I love this book up until I finished it!!!  I could hardly put it down and couldn't wait to pick it up again.  However, I was Extremely disappointed with the way the book ended.  I keep thinking that I haven't finished it and want to pick it up again to find out what happens to everyone.  It's still very disappointing and could have had a much more conclusive ending. Unless there are plans for a sequel, I feel like the author just rushed to finish the book.  I wish I hadn't read it at all because it just leaves me wondering.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Had way less special effects than I expected the trailer gave away a lot of the cool parts. It said 1.99 but I was charged 3.99 and got a MP3 credit.
B0085RQLXK|5.0|I listened to Aerosmith doing a Townhall on Sirius XM,where they discussed this album and a few tracks were played. \\"Love You Alot\\" was one of those tracks and true to Aerosmith form was so rocking, that I bought the album that day. I really tire of reading reviews that compare newer albums from older classic bands to older ones. Everyone wants thier favorite band to reinvent an older concept. the truth is that all bands and artists are people who evolve and grow. Granted I did not care for \\"Just Push Play\\" except for the title track,and I do not love every album that comes out by any band. I love Bon Jovi but did not like their last album \\"The Circle\\", but I would not call it garbage or a money grab by that band. I think \\"Music From Another Dimension is solid and true to Aerosmith. One thing I can always say about Aersomith is that I know it is them when I hear them-and this is definitely Aerosmith. They still rock.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a very good book and I like the action in the story. I would recommend this book to anyone who has not read it.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Mumford and sons' albums are a needle in a haystack find, especially with the junk on the radio these days.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|THis case is totally awesome.  I got it for my daughter for her birthday and a kindle fire and she loves it. Very strong and durable. She has dropped it more than once and it hasn't broken or even scraped.
B004INNRFK|5.0|What can I say?  David Foster is a musical genius, and his producing, writing and accompanying the artists are superb.  What a talent!  What a gift! I had seen this on PBS 2-3 years ago and had given it as gifts; finally ordered my own.  My highlight was Earth, Wind & Fire. David led off singing \\"After the Love Is Gone\\" which he says started his \\"real career\\", and he honored Maurice White who was there, seated in the audience.  Michael Bolton's \\"When a Man Loves A Woman\\"--Wow!!! Lara Fabian--what a gift!  The child prodigy Jackie Evancho is such a total package/gift of heavenly voice and sweet smile and demeanor. Natalie Cole, Kenny Loggins, Chaka Khan, Charice, Martina McBride, Ruben Studddard, Seal, Donna Summer All-4-One, Kenny G, the Canadian Tenors, Ne-Yo, Gary Wright etc. ALL had outstanding performances. A CD is included (some selections). You must get this!!!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Not what I expected.  Interesting.  I was not riveted by the story once having read it, as I had heard so much about the movie.<br />--
B009WO7NQO|5.0|We all put in on our devices and had a great time! We love angry birds and tried to get the best score!
B00A6N8F4Y|3.0|The story is weak and the movie plays out pretty dull.  This should have been a much better movie given star power, but I can't exactly pin point what's missing.  I can only say it did not deliver as expected.
B007IO1X5C|4.0|Quite a heavy read which seemed to repeat itself at times.  Illustrates the different values we hold now compared to 30 or 40 years ago..
B007HACDLK|4.0|I have read all the Mitch Rapp series, more of the Dirty Harry style, screw the rules, these perps are dead meat that is so satisfying to read but would make for the kind of reality that totalitarian regimes thrive on. I enjoyed the book, and had I paid about half what the Kindle version cost, I would be happy instead of feeling like I should have waited a few years and got it at the library.
B000YHG72E|5.0|I absolutley LOVE LOVE LOVE this Christmas movie!!! I would recommend this movie for all to see!!! =) I love Buddy the Elf!!
0671449028|5.0|I plan to give my Grandaughter this  book for Christmas. When I worked at a pre-school, the very young children loved the book.  I love it too. Because of her age (less than two years old), hers will be a board book.  Sue Boyton is a wonderful childrens author and the pre-schoolers and I enjoyed all of her books that we read together.I
B0091REZMW|4.0|Really like this game and don't buy diamonds.  Needs to restore energy and diamonds reasonably.  Not many people will spend $$ and there needs to be a happy medium.  When you get further along in the game &amp; more phenomena you have to wait to play and hope to be quick enough or repeat the wait.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Not a let down from The Hunger Games. We'll worth the read for fans of the first book. Thank you!
B005CKPQ7A|5.0|I do not wish to provide a review at this time; however, my display of stars should more than explain my position on this wonderful product.
B0095T3H2U|3.0|I really looked forward to seeing this movie and was a little disappointed. It didn't have as much humor in it as I thought it would have. Also it was a bit drawn out. It was okay.
1451696191|3.0|This is a very readable story, but it goes nowhere, and when it finally just ends, it is totally forgettable.  I already can't remember the hero's name.  Time passes, things happen, yada, yada, yada.  It is like tiresome, repetitive, gray wallpaper: no flowers.
1932100660|1.0|Berries and cream. Shrimp and broccoli with garlic butter sauce. Omelets with unprocessed ham, fresh feta cheese, and lots of veggies.<br /><br />None of the dishes I just mentioned contain any wheat, and they also contain very little carbohydrate, and no refined sugar.  Wheat is not something that most humans have been adapted to eat.  Tons of people are allergic to it.  You may be allergic to it and not even know it.<br /><br />Research it.<br /><br />Fat does not cause heart disease.<br /><br />Look it up.<br /><br />This book is chock full of fallacies, as the preceding negative reviews suggest.
0307346617|5.0|bought for husband who is a huge zombie fan<br />highly recommended<br />fast shipping<br />he has read book 3 times<br />good for all ages<br />only complaint is font is small, so not good for readers who need a larger font
B0038BBA4I|5.0|I don't know why I waited so long to buy this CD, because it's one of the best I've heard in a long time.  With perfect harmonizing and Marcus Mumford's powerful vocals this CD is in my top ten favorites.
B009LK6JS2|4.0|No glitches when I used it, but the graphics were weird sometimes, and the view from the front shows the flame
1608871088|4.0|The artwork in this book is absolutely stunning. The landscapes and the thought put behind each character is really inspiring, and I really love this book. The only complaint that I have about it is that I really wish that there were more images dedicated to character development. There were so many pictures of the characters as final products, but it would've been really nice to see the process.<br /><br />Other than that, it's a great book with beautiful pictures and a pretty interesting read.

0984158421|5.0|Insightful look into the young mind of Hitler.  If you really want to understand hitler then this is the book to read.  You don't have to like him to enjoy the book.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I am currently reading book 5 and this one was about characters I didn't have as much interest in. Waiting for number 6 to come out.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|Have not played this game enough to know how I want to rate it. The part I did play was entertaining.
1451627289|4.0|King has written a beautifully detailed account of the events surrounding the Kennedy assassination. This is a well written novel that contains great suspense and lots of things to ponder when you wonder what would have happened if....<br />.
B00A7ZXDLQ|4.0|It isn't better than her last album, but it is worth a listen. Diamonds is a great song. The rest of the album will take some getting use to as the songs aren't as catchy as her previous albums!!!
B00A7Z8KAU|2.0|I use Sketchbook Pro with my Cintiq. The problem here is that the lines are so choppy even though they have different pen settings. I don't expect the drawing to be just as good and I would accept a linear degradation in quality. But the quality degradation on the Kindle is on an exponential level. It's terrible. If firm the choice, I would not have purchased it. I do enjoy the Sketchbook Pro software on other devices like my Macbook and Cintiq. I also enjoy reading on the Kindle but not using this program on this format.
B008QE9XD2|3.0|Good shipping time. I was disappointed in the movie. It had its good spots, but few and far between. Johnny Dapp is always good.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I love this game! can not wait for the next installment! Hard but it has a hint button so it was all good.
B001M3WPY8|4.0|I always read the Sunday comic strips and Prince Valiant was my favorite. Henry Hathaway brought the story to life with all the heroism, pagentry and romance of the age. I was 13 when it was released in theaters. All I saw was the grand spectacle, the pagentry, heroism, valor and romance. Even the sets and costumes seemed magical. It never occurred to me to draw any comparisons to the comic strip. I was just enraptured and entertained. The film was hokey, poorly written and the casting was suspect. Sterling Hayden overacted as Gawain: it was almost like he was shouting most of the time. James Mason was the only member of the cast who turned in a credible performance. Janet Leigh and Debra Paget were good in supporting roles.Victor Mc Loglan as Boltar was simply terrible. Even Robert Wagner as Valiant seemed to be contrived at times.  But with all it's short comings when I was thirteen years old it was quite possiblt the greatest adventure film I had ever seen. This film, unlike any other, was able to transport me back to 1954. A nostaglic period where it was still possible to believe that good always conquers evil.\\"Rise Sir Valiant\\"
B003JJA59K|2.0|I'm sure the book is much better. As for the movie, I lost interest and didn't even bother to finish it. Seriously, people, it seems to me that there really isn't much one can do with this whole apocolypse scenario. It's always the same scenarios: just zombies, cannibals, and fight for survival. How original. This movie particularly was a waste of time, because really all it is was &#34;survival,&#34; so-to-speak. No zombies, even. Hardly any antangonists at all. Mostly just the threat of danger: all bark and no bite. The characters were hella lame, too. I don't know about you, but I wanted to slap the crap out of Viggo's whiny, and annoying brat of a son. What a little cry baby, for real. I found it quite unrealistic and hard to believe that a child his age would be more concerned with the moral development of his father, than with their own survival. If I were his age, and me and my dad ever survived an apocolypse, I think my dad would be the only person I would trust and I would never question his judgement. Therefore, if my dad told me to shoot a guy, I might be scared at first, but I certainly wouldn't argue with him. Whack!
B006YXTRHY|5.0|I can't wait to see the final movie. I loved the books. Of course movies are never as good as the books. As far as movies go they were all pretty good.
B008M721MS|5.0|sure its not facebook, or anything like that, but lemme tell ya, iblove this app! it makes communication between friends and family easy
B00005B1W7|5.0|Anthony Hopkins gives a stellar performance in his role as a polish doctor accused of war crimes by an American author, Ben Gazzara. One of the best post war dramas ever produced for T.V. Most court room dramas tend to be long, drawn out and at some point become  dreary and boring. QBVII somehow avoids these pitfalls with a gripping story line and better than average performances by the supporting cast including Lee Remick and Leslie Caron.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I use this calculator on a regular basis and find it easy to see and use.  Having access to the calculator on my Kindle is very handy.  I would have gotten it even if I had to pay for it.
0783230370|5.0|This is a fun movie, I enjoy the newer idea for a movie.  Arnold does a great job being a pregnant woman.  Then following the story it becomes more involved and entertaining.

B004J4WKTW|4.0|Our Book club picked this book to read and I could not put it down until I finished the book.
0345803485|1.0|What no one mentions, not to spoil the sequels, is that this novel is not about erotica, or literary genius, but abuse.  Christian was abused.  Ana is abused - and likes it.  50 years of women's rights right down the drain.  It's a sad statement on women in general, including the readers that praised it.  The sex is not that extraordinary.  The fact that someone lets a rich man spank them and ask them to beat them with belt is just plain sick in 2012.  No where is this mentioned in the reviews between those that love the book and those that hate it.  I know Oprah likes it so I guess there are not many women out there who can think for themselves anymore.  50 Shades is a sad statement.
B005LAII08|5.0|I would not recommend this for really young children because they will not understand the premise of the show but by about age 8 they would be able to understand what the young girl is learning and can understand what is happening in the movie.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I find this app to be very accurate, and it has a great layout. Kinda makes it more fun to check the weather ! lol

B008QTVNUI|5.0|Awesome series! Intriguing, great characters played by terrific actors. It's hard to wait a whole week to see what's going to happen next.
B009CG2YDE|2.0|it  was really boring got it on my fire kindle.;/ :0. the controls worked fine.but I would rather have it to touch the monster instead.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Picture quality is excellent.  I love my Amazon library on line and have dropped Netflix.  Much easier to than collecting a bunch of DVD's.
B0027BVMSY|2.0|No Bond here; a bust instead. Mediocre plot, flat dialogue and numbing chases through grey settimgs.<br />It was a boring Bond without a clear nemisis.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|The movie as a hole was great. The pucture was awesome! I especially loved the color. The story was something new for princess stories. My Daughter (3 yrs old) loved it aswell
1423124111|5.0|I got this book because one of my favorite things about the Disney parks is the posters they have (near the front of the park, etc).<br />Pro: Well edited book, that really shows off the artwork. I realize that there is not a lot of writing with this (mostly art) but that is kind of the point of the book.<br />Con: It is not really the type of book you would read from front to back—more like something you pick up, look through for a bit and then come back to later.<br />Great book; great price.
B0053O89KG|5.0|We love this TV series. If your in the mood for a little mystery combined with humor then watch this!
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|i thought it would have more action in it considering she is  insane with the bow and thats what i got from the title/ photo on the cover but it o well<br /><br />was a good watch would watch it again great movie for the kiddies.
B009NOVCTM|4.0|Thanks Davida84!  Got my 3Disc Stones Gh's yesterday.  NO WAY WAS I WAITING 1-3 WEEKS FOR AMAZON TO SHIP IT..(which is what AMZN is currently saying as of Nov 22nd)...WTH!  For $24 I got it in 3days!  Top that Amazon!<br /><br />As for the CD's....It took me a long time to get into the Stones, and for me this 3Disc set provides me everything I want in this classic bands recordings, BEST YET...the One song that drove me nuts (cuz it would always get stuck in my head and I hated it)...IS NOT HERE...Sa-weeeeeta!  I'm not going to say the song...cuz it will get stuck in my head!  But feel free to comment and to ask (or guess, since I'm not telling)  I will say the Super Deluxe version has it, but I didn't need super deluxe.<br /><br />All-in-all this is a great retrospect on one of the Worlds most reknown bands, glad to have added this to my collection!<br /><br />My Fav's:  Jumpin Jack, Under my Thunmb, Beast of Burden....and the whinny Angie, Aaaaaannnnnngie!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|It is a great game for me and my family i lve it so i would recomend you get it now
B0027MJU00|5.0|Amazing story!!!! Even better than gone girl....I would put this on the must read list! It messed with your head a little<br />And was graphic at times... But still very good
B0098VYKSA|3.0|Showed all the good visual affects during the previews. While I'm being told to write 11 more words is also annoying.
0385536828|4.0|This books gets off to a very slow start until the protagonist Serena is given a project to work on.  Lies and inventions are truly the name of the game here.  Stories within stories provide the interest.  It is also interesting to find out that the protagonist is not who she thinks she is.  Is she a game changer or a player?  A little more intrigue would have helped, not such blatant deception.  I like this author very much and hope he writes a bit more.
B009VB7QQA|5.0|great special graphics, wierd twist on the civil war,it lets you consider the effect on the war on the south,and how the federal goverment,can overide state rights,even the president going over the head of the secertary of state to get what he wanded.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|It's Plenty Gory....  But not scary enough.<br /><br />Gory can't and doesnt carry the show.  Frightening does.<br />I would like to be more frightened while watching the show
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The Racketeer had several twists that were intriguing.  Believablility was strectched to the max but it was nevertheless a good read.
B009IQ0TGM|4.0|Some of the songs seem too similar. Who can really complain though - the album overall has a nice sound.
0679720200|2.0|This book was required reading for my son's HS senior honors english course.  He found it quite laborious to read and didn't like it - but it was required, so what can you do?  DO not recommend for casual reading, but it's a great price if your child has to have it for school
B00544L9EI|5.0|Eminem brings it back to the raunchy, real, and often rude with his lyrical genius! The dude can flow and he's got a lot to say so listen up and enjoy!
B005EGXNLS|3.0|The last chapter of the Utrecht's saga. Bernard Cornwell is able to build, as usual, a great plot based on love, courage, honor and friendship on the background of the great historical events of 10th century Britain. In my opinion, it's three stars, just a little bit below the other books of the series.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Addictive and challenging.  You start to see the patterns but then they give you a really tough one and you have to come up with a new strategy. Lots of fun and access for free!
B007HO392S|5.0|Ms. Underwood rocks this out!  I love her new tracks, and have now bought 4 of this CD to give to everyone who loves classy and current music.  She is the best at what she does.  I will continue buying it!!!
B00005B6C9|5.0|Bought this for a gift because i love the songs so much,,was so happy with my order and would buy from you again thank you
B003Y5H5F6|5.0|A great escapist movie. A good addition to the series. I've not tried the digital download yet. Gotta love Kate.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Grissom holds you in every paragraph, telling history that is not so readily known.  Her style is historically compassionate<br />and accurate with a depth into each character that holds the readers to every page.  I thoroughly enjoyed the book !
B008ER9QLK|5.0|This LaPage Production fulfills the complete narrative both visually and vocally from the notes and transcripts of<br />the Composer Himself, Ricard Wagner.  AND for once the singers Physicially fit the Rolls that they are playing.<br /><br />I would dare anyone to watch the First Act of Walkure and not FALL COMPLETELY IN LOVE WITH THE RING!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|A nice little way to kill time without the huge time investment that a more complicated strategy game requires. Worth the download!
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|well done on this topic that has been around scifi for years, refreshing in its approach to the subject, enjoyed it
B008OB1QFK|1.0|I was disappointed, a little too rural in style for me.  I'll listen to it again and see if it sounds better.
B004QK5N5W|5.0|Just what you are looking for if u have an HD tv. This is a buy if you have enough money.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|Do not buy.It will not let me even play.After the video it takes me to the main menu.The Gameloft tricks you for your money.DO NOT BUY AT ALL!GAMELOFT STINKS!
B0006M4SO6|5.0|I first heard Pat Metheny in high school over thirty years ago. With the exception of two albums I have enjoyed everything he has put out. I also am amazed that he he is always trying to do something new and he usually pulls it off. I have listened to The Way Up probably twenty times and it is amazing. I'd like to describe it as symphonic, because of the four movement structure but also because the themes gradually reveal themselves. You need to be patient with this one. I recommend that you put it on in the car at the beginning of a long drive on the highway. The live version is also fantastic as you get to see the musicians, all of whom are multi-talented. The video focuses on the MUSIC!! That's what it's all about, people!
B009CPES4I|5.0|Wonderful!  Great setting, likeable characters. You're left<br />with a great sense of joy and that &#34;all is right with the world&#34;.
B009SQQRH2|5.0|i watched this with my mom and we are big christmas movie fans. and this movie has to be one of the cutest ones i have seen in a while
B0078XGJQQ|5.0|I had doubts before reading this book, thinking Rhonda Byrnes other amazing books would have covered it all but I was wrong. This is by far the best, giving you actual instructions on how to live an amazing life and get everything you want! It really works and is utterly Life Changing and I will always be Thankful to Rhonda Byrne for this :)
B002APU580|5.0|This is perhaps my favorite tale of society culture and men and young women finding love. It is also my favorite Jane Austin book and movie and series.  It is set at just about the turn of the century in around 1800.  It must have been a naughty kind of a read because Austin really does use the book to poke fun at the Aristocracy and the way they turn their noses down at everyone.  There is one slightly superior BBC version made up of several episodes where the young lady who played Elizabeth is just as pretty as Keira Knightly with long and beautiful black hair and an ivory complexion, but I so enjoyed this one too.  How indifference becomes irritation and then almost hate before we see an perfect partner as who he or she really is must be the most endearing story of romance.  They each see a reflection of each other in their stubborn pride and it's what each dislike about themselves.  Well, they have to get over that because there is a lot they share in common.  Darcy is very handsome, but shy.  Elizabeth is very beautiful and used to speaking her mind.  Her father encourages that a great deal.  Her mom is pushing all the girls to get married and Elizabeth will not be married just to obtain a better station in life for herself.  The poor and lower aristocracy is represented in the Bennetts with Elizabeth as one of many daughters.  They are intelligent and spirited and have a good opinion of themselves.  Mr Darcy and his friend Mr. Bingley come to stay in their own grand homes.  They are high aristocracy.  Can rich fall in love with poor? Does wealth matter very much when love is what matters.  We shall see and you will enjoy the whole funny, tender, and mishap filled road to romance.  Very, very enjoyable and really quite hopeful and upbeat overall.
0375869026|5.0|My first language is spanish and I am always looking for books to introduce my 12 year old with reading on english, what a wonderful experience was to found a beautiful contemporary story that childs and adults alike would like. We laugh, we cry and were amazed with this treasure...
B001XUH69Y|2.0|i watched this movie for an hour and i just couldnt get into it. It just wasnt my kind of movie...it is very slow to start the story line
0802136834|4.0|I personally found Six Wives very readable, but not everyone will. It is not like the Philippa Gregory books, which are fiction (built on historical fact) and therefore include intimate thoughts and discussions that bring the era to life but are completely imagined. In this book, Weir aims to write a scholarly history. She therefore uses primary or secondary sources where available, and notes if there is little or no reliable information. Some readers find the level of detail boring, but Weir includes some details for a reason. There are very few objective sources of information about Henry VIII's wives. The royal household financial records are an exception and reveal what the wives did with their time, and thus their personal interests (e.g. good works, gifts to abbeys, patronage of various scholars). So Weir includes details about clothing, food, and household spending because this information is reliable and shows us how these women lived.<br /><br />Some reviewers feel Weir is biased. She does guess as to why this person acted one way or another if no contemporary sources reveal such motivations. If you disagree with her guess, you may feel that she is unfairly biased. Weir is not a champion of Anne Boleyn, but I didn't think she was unfair. She sees Anne as imperfect (and that's ok, who isn't) but ultimately a victim of the era and Henry VIII. Weir seems to think less of Boleyn's successor Jane Seymour, who she describes as a calculating, manipulative opportunist. My main complaint is that Weir tends to contradict herself. As Henry VIII gets older and meaner, he disposes of his counselors and wives and lashes out at his subjects. Weir says that the English people (understandably) feared him, when once he was their beloved king. But when Henry VIII dies, Weir says the English truly mourned their cherished king and refused to hear anything against him in the local pubs. This may be true, but if it is, there is not enough information in the book to account for their massive change in sentiment. Weir also ends with a discussion of Henry VIII's great and kingly qualities, but these qualities are sure hard to detect in the rest of the book. It's as if she decided to rehabilitate him in a few paragraphs. I found this confusing and annoying after she spent hundreds of pages portraying him as a humorless, smelly, willfully obese, self-pitying, paranoid despot who bankrupted the country with pageantry and sent scores of people to the gallows for perceived slights against him.<br /><br />However, I read this book in a couple of days and found it very compelling. It reveals a lot about Henry VIII's reign and the political machinations of the time. Definitely recommended despite aforemnt'd criticisms.
B0083GPDBO|4.0|I enjoyed the movie a great deal especially as the young men gained and learned how to use their new powers.  It very much kept my attention.  Then a kind of dark side crept into the film and events became very confused and the young men struggled with their emotions and why or why not to show these new powers and for whom.  The ending was a bit of surprise to me and I don't know if I would have sent it that way.  Still quite good and a realistic look about what happens to young me who are given a lot when they never think that will happen to them.
0486237664|2.0|There are tons of creatures in this book and interesting as it may be, many of the drawings are older and not to proper scale or perspective which is not going to be helpful if you are wanting them as a quick view for drawing or painting your own. Since I purchased it for that purpose I am disappointed. It is a nice book but not for what I was needing it for and if I had actually seen the book instead of purchasing online I would not have bought it at any price.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|This movie is entertaining and well-paced. The story could have benefitted from more internal conflict in the female protagonist's character, or more depth to the primary love story, but it's still worth watching.
B009GQ57ES|4.0|Some amazing songs here. Some not so amazing. A solid album, I need to pick some more of his stuff up.
B009329ZF2|4.0|The movie was a very positive surprise to me as were some of the astonishing special effects.  The plot kept moving and the action was almost non-stop.  A game of cat and mouse between a huge alien ship and an outmatched but modernized older human ship.  How do you fool the enemy?  What's the strategy to use?  A very good tale that I really expected very little from. A sleeper that will surprise you on some Saturday night and keep you entertained and engaged.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I am a big Taylor Swift fan and I love this album. Great Album from Taylor. Every new album gets better and better, great songs
0345472322|5.0|If you are interested in growing your potential, this book is for you! If you're interested in raising your child, or teaching your students, in a way that encourages a growth mindset, this book is for you. Dweck's research is spot-on and very informative. The text is written in an approachable way that is easily understood and implemented.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is my favorite game that I have on  the device. It's really fun to make your own village and complete families for the little ice age animals.There is even &quot;goals &quot; that you have to complete. Oh and you can't forget Scrat who will pop up every once and a while.
B009CG2YDE|3.0|overall it's not a bad game however due to the lack of control options it gets-2 stars as normal touch would be way more fun.
B00A4GXJD0|5.0|Great Rock and Roll Album!!!  One of his stronger efforts...Definitely a solid SOuthern Rock feel, with some great songs, Rebel Soul and Lets Ride being my personal favorites
B002PMPTIO|5.0|I saw this for the first time a few days ago.  Quality of the film making seems better than the average of the other Star Trek movies.  I was concerned at the beginning though when the film was not flowing well. Will watch it several times more.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|This game is really awesome its too bad the full version isn't free. But get the app its really fun to play
B009D0LBRO|3.0|The game is very cute and I love Rayman games for the Wii so I decided to it a try. It is not hard to maneuver, but I found I got stuck on a board and could not get out of it. I was very disappointed that it got stuck so easily. I am not a novice gamer, although not an expert either, but I can usually get around the occasional annoying bug. This was beyond trying to get around. I was truly stuck. I eventually uninstalled the game. I may try it again in the future after it updates.
B00708L34C|4.0|Love most he puts out, this is another stand out album, all the songs flow together with the album from start to finish.
0385535147|5.0|Sometimes I read the one star reviews first just to get a feel for what others might think. This time they just don't seem to say anything, and the harsh comments seem to point to people who didn't read the book, or read only a few chapters at most. True, some parts seemed to drag, and occasionally irrelevant, yet it is so well plotted that unless you stay with it until the very end you are bound to miss some great surprises.<br /><br />I rarely give five star reviews (see my other reviews), but this is a rare exception. Some flaws, a few characters that are not well developed, but it is the plotting that saves this one, and - I don't recall ever saying this before - but I think it would be a great movie, on the order or \\"Presumed Innocent.\\" It is not, nor do I believe Grisham is intending to write great literature, instead I feel it is pure entertainment, and it works.
B00A14SQBU|5.0|Lotus is such an amazing album. It has a lot of great meaningful songs like &#34;just a fool; blank page, light up the sky.&#34; We have such empowerment songs as &#34;army of me, cease fire, lotus intro.&#34; Then we have some club banging songs as &#34;let there be love, your body,  make the world move.&#34; This album is great, it would not disappoint. This album is like stripped 2.0. If you really listen to the lyrics, you would understand what these songs convey.
B006DRVFRQ|3.0|downloaded this by accident....  have never really used it. was trying to get to Google search engine and this is what I picked.  not saying it is bad, I just haven't used it yet!
B009CG2YDE|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this app. Easy to pick up and play whenever. Might get monotonous after a while though...
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|The idea that Indiana Jones would be preserved on Blue Ray Disk is a wonderful idea. The movies as we remember them are simply Classics!!!  They dont make movies like they used to!!!
B007TNS6JI|4.0|Good game overall. The only problem for me was the startup loading time took forever to load. The game runs pretty well. It has a bit of lag and glitching but over all a solid game. The free tag helps to make up for these few problems though.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|great game for kids to grown up kids. multi levels from easy to hard great app.  great brain teaser as well keeps you hooked after first try.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|This is a. Incredable story of survival and of adapting to your present surroundings.it definnatly tests your. Inner stregths  and weeknesses
B009VB7QQA|4.0|Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter was much better than everyone said it would be. It was fun to watch, and kinda funny too.
B0086213XW|5.0|The story sucks you in... I laughed, I cried, I was seduced. Worth watching. Amazingly cast and extremely well written. The 'keep a joke until we're 80' melted my heart.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|this is obviously a great movie because i watched it 2 times in the theater. i also pre-ordered this movie 3 months before it was released on dvd. This movie has ACTION and COMEDY in one. took my wife and mother in law and they both loved it! they were negative about it before we saw it, but they quickly changed there minds. so we saw it again the following weekend. MUST SEE FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY!!!
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Really cheap! $5 while the product key for mircosoft word is $50! It prints easily and it has all the basic things needed for word. Only problem is that you have to pay for extra fonts. Love it! Dont even need wifi to send the paper to your email! I definitely recommend it! Buy it! You will not regret it!
B008GXHOFW|1.0|ok so i bought the game cuz it sounded awsome...i bought it and played it for a, while and i loved it!!!!! but now when i try to start the game or play it, it automatically shuts off!!!! i donteven get to play it at all...i recomend dont buy it

0062060562|4.0|I really liked the book. It kept my attention throughout and I was surprised at the ending which is always a plus.
034580404X|5.0|After reading Twilight I thoroughly enjoyed this trilogy. While it was pretty predictable, think Pretty Woman, it was entertaining none the less.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|It allows me to control my computers from anywhere and it send audio with it. Just like teamviewer but better.
1451695195|3.0|I found there to be points of interest  I had seen the author on TV. Way too much background on the Surgeon's life.
B007THA4FI|5.0|I was so curious about this book, after being (obviously) a Harry Potter fan and reading the critics reviews and reviews on Amazon, I had to read it.  I had no expectations at all when I began the book, and certainly didn't expect any Harry Potter influences and I was rewarded with a great reading experience.  JK Rowling did an excellent job of developing her characters, drawing from their background and childhood experiences and revealing more and more about the characters as the plot developed.  The heart-wrenching scenes involving the Weedon household as well as the inner turmoil of all the characters were so well written you felt like you knew everyone personally.  The politics surrounding the 'casual vacancy' were very intriguing.  I couldn't stop reading this book and I completely disagree with the negative reviews about it.  I eagerly await the next installation of JK Rowling's fabulous career.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|This series from the start was humerus and down to earth .For a author to reach a seventh book in a series is a big accomplishment especially with a totally new a untested format . It is a brilliant with all the twist and turns from middle school threw high school this book is brilliant.
1600595871|5.0|This book is well worth buying.  The instructions are clear and concise. Anyone choosing to make handmade books would be well advised to choose this book for guidlines.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Works great. A lot of options and like that you can layer different sounds together to create different moods. Would recommend.
B009KHCT94|2.0|I know this is supposed to be a comedy of some kind but I found it stupid boring and offensive.  Why don't you ask the millions of people murdered at the death camps if they think it is funny?
0316228532|1.0|If I had realized this book was so depressing, I never would have ordered it. I like to read books that improve my life, entertain, or a can't put this book down until I finish it even if it is 2:00 am.
B000MR1V22|5.0|I watch this film a few times a year. The performances are all excellent. It is not a glossy perfect type family and to me it rings true of people and life challenges we face. One of my favorite films.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Started watching again after the season break and Boom was instantly sucked in again. Can't wait for the next weeks show. One of the few series I watch.
B005GRF2UK|5.0|William Hurt and Charlotte Gainsborough are well matched in this story of love, heartbreak and forgiveness.  Must have if you're a William Hurt fan.
B003Y5H4SO|2.0|I could have sworn this guy used to make high quality movies, such as Signs and The Sixth Sense.  This, however, was another recent Shyamalan disappointment.  The only good thing it really has going for it is that the directing is good and it's not particularly cheesy.  You won't roll your eyes too much or laugh (too much), but it still essentially a failure, especially compared to his first films.<br /><br />Premise: people stuck in an elevator and one of them is the devil.  Cop whose family was killed by a hit-and-run gets involved in trying to get these people out of the elevator.  His story ties into the main one, unsurprisingly.  In other words, your job is to figure out who the devil is.  I guessed it within the first minute of seeing all of the suspects and was correct.  I shouldn't be able to guess so easily!<br /><br />Nothing groundbreaking here.  Not scary.  If you're scared of blood, there's hardly any of it, so don't worry.  Instead of blood, lights occasionally go off in the elevator, followed by lots of loud screaming and thumping and then someone would end up injured from the devil.  M. Night Shyamalan isn't the cheap thrill bloody movie type, preferring to scare in other ways (and he used to be GOOD at it), but I wasn't scared at all ;(<br /><br />I recommend if you're really, really bored or sick and it's On Demand and you have nothing else to watch.
B008J34466|5.0|Pink's music talks to my heart; the range of emotions she sings of in relationships rings true for me. Her music has helped me know I'm not alone in the crazy, conflicted emotions humans feel when in love & hate & deep sadness & longing.

B005OLF6BI|4.0|im partly disagreeing to the reviewer  (R.PEREAZ)  here.  im a big fan of aguilera, keys, houston, fabian. But i think taylor will be even more talented when her vocal is a little bit more established and matured as she reaches 30. Taylor swift is more talented than most people her age and look at How many singers can write music, play guitar,are beautiful and have a personna like taylor at that age. There may be a few around, but very rare. Real talent is not just about amazing vocals. Look at lots of the amazingly talented indie rock bands out there, they put out and have created a lot of the best work in music,  but a lot of them dont have amazing vocal. their talent lies in so many aspects of music and production.
B009WO7NQO|2.0|I really want it to be free because then I would be able to play it! so can you please make it free?
B002FHJ4B2|5.0|...my two teens had not seen this movie.<br />We had a great time watching it with them.<br />Film was good quality.
B0081FO2Q4|5.0|The songs are different to keep the album interesting. He's got a Jason Mraz sound. I would highly recommend this CD.
B005HWUBZ0|2.0|I like Mayer's music.  Nice melodies.  But what I don't appreciate is the bad language.  It lacks class.  And for that reason I give his CD a bad review.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Star Wars & Angry Birds... Just great. Love the additions and the great features of all the birds. Highly recommend.
B0085TKAW6|4.0|Edmund Burke first said that those of us who dont know History are destined to repeat it. Ken Follet presents us with an objective view of the Social Systems in place at the time and all their failings. What we should discern from this is that there is no perfect system. Whether we are Facists, Socialists or Free Market Fundamentalists we all need to respect our Humanity or suffer the consequences.
B0037RDPEG|4.0|I've read this book twice & seen the movie (mostly for the ever gorgeous Javier Bardem)& maybe it was because of what I was going through personally at the time but I found it to be an inspiring story of faith, joy & love. The prose was easy to read & Elizabeth's descriptions of the places, sites & sounds let me be right there with her, eating pasta, having my senses accosted in India & feeling the first pangs of new love in Bali.<br /><br />Before I purchased this book on Kindle I checked out some of the other reviews & some of them were scathing. I have to admit that I have not read any other work by Elizabeth Gilbert but what I want to end with is that if you take this book at face value & enjoy it for what it is, then you will have an enjoyable read, and if you go just a little deeper you will hopefully see the message that I feel Elizabeth is trying to convey to others, which is there is always hope, there is always love & there is always a rainbow at the end of the storm.
B004JMY312|5.0|I have watched this movie ever since I was a little kid, and it has become a tradition for me to watch it every year. I normally watch it on TV with my family, but I've been at college, and realized I didn't own it on dvd yet. I didn't feel like waiting for it to ship, and wanted to watch it instantly so I am extremely happy that Amazon gave me the option of watching it on instant video. :)
B004W1GCVE|4.0|Disappointed in such a short season for the start of possibly a new Upstairs Downstairs.  The original had long seasons, so well written, and<br />lasted 6 years.  When production puts so little thought into a project as to give it a send off with 3 episodes, why bother to see if it will do better in its second season.
030759565X|5.0|I've followed the smitten kitchen blog for several years, and have always considered it a reliable source for recipes. The cookbook has proved to be equally full of delicious recipes. I am a vegetarian, so I skipped over the entire chapter on meat, but this cookbook is still worth every penny, with a wide variety of recipes to choose from.<br /><br />I'm an avid home cook, and the author's choice of recipes, as well as her writing style, appeal to me. This is essentially her blog (with almost all new recipes) translated into cookbook form, so I have no problem with the long-ish comments for each recipe, nor the occasional references to her child (which happen less than in the actual blog). In my opinion, it makes the overall tone of the cookbook more engaging to the typical home cook.<br /><br />As expected, the pictures are simple but stunning. The quality of the book is also very nice (to me, making it absolutely worth the money, since I hate cookbooks that won't stay open!). My only minor complaint, which has already been mentioned, is that the instructions frequently run over onto another page, or are on a different page than the ingredients. Other than that, the organization of the recipes is very logical.<br /><br />So far I've made the Rosemary, Gruyere and Sea Salt Crisps, Gingerbread-Spiced Dutch Baby, Vinegar Slaw with Cabbage and Dill, Leek Fritters with Lemon and Garlic, Linguine with Cauliflower Pesto, and Emmentaler on Rye with Sweet and Sour Red Onions. All turned out very nicely, and to me, the instructions were straight-forward enough that even someone relatively new to cooking should be able to follow along. I have a long list of recipes that I still want to try (next up: the chocolate-raspberry rugelach), and I anticipate that this cookbook won't disappoint.
B004UIOUHC|3.0|This is my 2nd favorite android browser after Firefox beta. Its still buggy and slow, although html 5 support has been improved so now YouTube videos play directly in the browser. The ui is also too minimalist with no add on support like with Firefox.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|really looked forward to the read...It was just ok<br />I think the movie would be better...I was just a little disappointed in the book.
B009157BWU|5.0|I thought it was a great movie, was kinda short but the content was amazing!<br />I would highly recommend for everyone!
B008A1NSTG|5.0|Wonderful heartwarming movie! So nice to see a non-violent movie with a beautiful message. A perfect movie to watch with the family.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|I had heard a live broadcast these guys did on 89.3 the Current and hadn't gotten a good feel for them from that - but as soon as I got the full album, it's grown on me with each listen.  There are tracks both intense and highly relaxed, but all flows together for a really great album that's been nearly on repeat for me the past month.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|If you like Angry Birds how could you not like it with the Star Wars twist?  My nine year old nephew is in Star War heaven.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I began by reading The Hunger Games and followed with Catching Fire.  Catching Fire left a lot of unresolved matters so I was particularly anxious to read Mockingjay and read it through in no time because I was so anxious to find out how it all ended.  I was sorry to reach the end because I just wanted to read more.
B0081FO2Q4|5.0|I love this album.  I've been recommending it to all my friends.  I can't wait to hear more from Ed Sheeran!
1451620829|5.0|Honesty is the word that comes to mind when reading this book. Just like Peter's songs always have his personality and heart in them, so does this book. Having read Ace's book before this one (which is good as well), I found Peter's to be much more revealing and the Catman never pulled any punches. Peter and Ace remain my favorite two Kiss members. Get the book, it's a great read.
B00992CF6W|1.0|if u want this game it sticks.I mean what's the point? and girls do not like it. so if you want to impress a girl DO NOT TALK ABOUT THIS GAME !!trust me she will not care!! thanks for listening to me opinion!)
B009YU62H2|5.0|If you are a Soundgarden fan, you will most likely love this album.  It ventures into new territory much like each of its predecessors did, not missing a beat in the Soundgarden catalog, despite the 16 year gap between Down on the Upside and this album.  If you don't like the album the first listen, listen to it again, and it will definitely grow on you.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|this app is awesome I love all the different dragons and it always has awesome new dragons to get every month!! if u are looking at this review GET THIS APP!! thank u for reading!!
B002BWP49C|5.0|LOVE IT Watched it over and over and will share it with my sister when she finishes the books :)
B0034G4OVS|4.0|This was a no-name movie to me but I kind of like outdoor adventure stuff. I took a chance and thought it was suspenseful and interesting.
B009E3EY38|5.0|I've read a bunch of reviews on this, and I won't try to be quite a wordy.  First, these guys are polished.  They sound great and the audio on the blu ray is fantastic.<br /><br />Robert Plant's voice still holds up and rocks it on the whole performance.  Jimmy Paige....well what can you say about the guy who really created the sound that so many other are still trying to get today?  Superb and I want some of those Gibsons.  John Paul Jones ties it all together on the hard hitting bass (one ten string in the mix, which sounds simply awesome) and the keyboards.  So many mind blowing riffs from the past.  Jason Bonham channels his dad though out the entire show.  Just a fantastic drummer.  If you haven't checked him out with Black Country Communion....you should!<br /><br />There are many high points in the show, but \\"In My Time of Dying\\" was awesome!  Pull it up on YouTube, and that alone should make you place your Amazon order for the blu ray edition of this show.<br /><br />I got the deluxe edition, and unlike some others.....I enjoyed the \\"bootleg\\" type quality of the bonus DVD.  It is what it is.  Nice to watch them honing their performance for the big stage.<br /><br />No question these guys have a tour in them.  So many of us would like to see them live.....consider it guys.<br /><br />You will not be disappointed with this in any way.  Some of the comments about video editing are just folks trying to find something to bitch about.  There are a lot of camera angles, but I did not find in distracting in the least.<br /><br />In short, BLUES/ROCK pioneers nail it with an awesome and well put together and hard hitting show!
B003UESJH4|5.0|This was a great movie. I like historical movies and this was extremely well acted -- this kind of movie is right up my alley. I always wait to find good prices on-line as well.  Deserves all the acclaim it received if you like this kind of story.
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|I like the series and need for my collection<br />No dislike Enjoy watch again and again<br />Anyone that has the original series needes this item
B001RHPJBU|5.0|all this time i thought i had his music in my itunes library... i didn't.  great deal for 5 bucks!
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|Most of his move are good<br />No dislike for a series that need to be saved<br />If you collect Sherlock Holmes you need this one.
B009P5S11G|4.0|Never was a Rihanna fan in the past except for a few songs. I was annoyed by the Auto-Tune and overprocessed vocals. Rihanna delivers a solid effort on this CD. Her voice is getting more depth as she gets older. Great cutting edge state of the art production from Stargate and The Dream. The order of songs could have made this a near classic CD. The first song was correct, Fresh Off The Runway and then it should have been followed by Jump then Diamonds. Mother Mary should have been the last song.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is awesome. so easy to use and the large numbers make it easy to read also. Absolutely love it!!!!!
B003QSOFFO|1.0|I tried several times to play this movie and it never did. I never got a chance to watch it because my online streaming expired before I could ever get it to work.
B00A6PD8RQ|3.0|Entertaining, yet more of the same. Nothing special.  My daughter and I found this very similar to Brother Bear.  We also could have done without seeing old men's butts...  yes it's just a cartoon nudity, but still.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I have seen all the second season andI am very impressed with the storyline, acting and overall production of this show. i look forward to  it every week and plan to buy the episodes I miss.  I have never been this engrossed in a television series ever; I am mostly a horror movie junkie (shock).  But this show is worth your time.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|This book is by far the best, and most exciting book in the series so far.  I enjoyed reading and started the next book immediately after completion.
B0099TJ4YQ|5.0|I love James Taylor and I love Christmas!!!  So it's the perfect match or gift.  I will probably keep it.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game!  Went to Support to find rules for game.  Although you have to wait for credits everyday to play bingo, it is fund and entertaining.
B004JHYRDQ|5.0|This is a favorite of mine. I've had it in paperback for years and had to have it for my kindle. I fell in love with the character, &#34;Gladia&#34;.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|it was a little slow and confusing at first, since it is introducing a lot of intriguing characters, i cheated and watched the first couple episodes of the HBO series to get a good concept of the plot and characters, but know that the show is as addicting as the book!
B004DLPXAO|4.0|The app is good rather finding the app to download was my problem none of the links worked<br />And the app is slow to update new books
B0090EJR1K|1.0|I really would rate it no stars but that was not an option.<br />I thought the beginning was funny but it was over the top offensive and disrespectful to minority admirable leaders.<br />I had to turn it off after awhile.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|You will LOVE this game! :) You should totally try it because it is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!! I think you would LOVE it as much as I do SO YOU SHOULD TRY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :) :) :) TRY IT!!!!!  YOU WILL LOVE IT!!!!!  Hope you get it and LOVE it!!!
0736092269|5.0|Great book and excellent reference material. You won't believe the intricacy of the drawings. There are additional pages that explain injuries and how they occur.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|We all can play...so many different levels...it is fun and addicting.  Even my 4yr old grandson and 9 yr old granddaughter can play at their individual levels and have success.
B00000G3PL|5.0|They are all great flicks and yes, number 4 is the funnieat of them all. So much for crappy sequels. Each one is better than the last.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I thought this book and the trilogy was amazing!! It was compelling and transported me into the life of Anastasia Steele. The scenes were so steamy and descriptive! It helped that I could relate to the character in the sense that I know exactly how she feels about Christian; as I feel the same way about my husband. If your looking for a different and adventurous read, go for it!! You won't regret it!!
B008MEM24S|5.0|Both my niece and nephews love this game. it is fun  and challenging. I have to admit I love it too!
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|The game is very addictive. and fun. I highly recommend it. There are tons of stuff to buy and great powerups. However yesterday I lost a jetpack I paid 20000 for. I got 20000 coins back but spent them on gadgets BEFORE I realized I did not have that jetpack.
B004LWZWGA|1.0|I have both Batman Begins and Dark Knight in 2-disc DVD editions. I would have liked to have completed my set with a 2-disc edition of Dark Knight Rises but it seems to only be available in a 1-disc DVD with almost no special features or the Blu-Ray/DVD combo. I like the special features but don't want to be forced into buying this in Blu-Ray. So irritating.
B000YHG72E|4.0|This is a new holiday classic, forget  A Christmas Story! If you want to laugh out loud this is the film for you.
B008G59IKO|4.0|I've been a Green Day fan since 1994, and I own every album (as well as a bootleg of Woodstock '94). I think that there first 7 albums are excellent. Their 8th, \\"Shenanigans,\\" was just ok. The they hit an inspired peak with \\"American Idiot\\" and \\"21st Century Breakdown.\\" These latest three albums have been released 3 1/2 years after \\"21st Century Breakdown,\\" and they've returned to their origins with 2 1/2  minute songs about love and anguish. Green Day fans will find something to like here, but don't expect \\"!Dos!\\" to compare with their best albums.<br /><br />\\"See You Tonight,\\" \\"Lazy Bones\\" and \\"Amy\\" are my favorite songs on this album, and I think they are quite good.
B009E3EY38|5.0|What can one say that has not been said already?<br /><br />The Celebration Day Blu-ray is an amazing and thrilling document of Led Zeppelin's final performance.  The band did everything right and the audio is undeniably the best-sounding Led Zeppelin recording that you're likely to hear.  Only Jimmy Page and his crew know how much remastering and other studio magic went into the soundtrack but the music sounds almost too good to be true.  Either way, Celebration Day definitely sounds the way the fans want Zeppelin to sound.  Kashmir has never pulsed, pounded and roared with more majesty.  The concert was so astounding that I didn't even notice this supposedly jumpy video editing that many reviewers keep mentioning.  Every concert video that I've seen in the past decade (and most Hollywood movies) have gone to this rapid-fire editing technique.  I guess that I've been well conditioned not to notice or care anymore.  For me, the presentation accurately balanced the intimacy on the stage with the large scale of the event.<br /><br />There was only one selfish downside to watching the concert in all its high-definition glory.  Five years ago, I came agonizingly close to obtaining tickets to this concert but missed out in the end.  Oh, to have been there for this one...
B0085RQLXK|2.0|Since Permanent Vacation, they have been on the down trend with glossy laced songs, and trying to reach the whole world with this pop rock stuff....  They need to get back to making an album like rocks, with that same feeling but different songs...  I don't think they can do it, without the drugs and in fighting....  I guess most of us misses that old Aerosmith...  Luckily we can listen to there old stuff anytime...
B007QNRMUU|3.0|There are a few songs on this CD that I love and love to play over and over.  But some of them are just ok, and I tend to just skip to my favorites.
B00A03WBVI|5.0|My daughter loved it, I got a screaming hug and a kiss.  My daughter loved it, I got a screaming hug and a kiss.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Amazing! Just love the asylum theme this year! Greatness. I can't get enough of this show! I think it's even better than season 1.
B004YXE438|5.0|I love puzzles! and this game satisfied all my needs for a puzzle solving fun with all the different difficulties and sizes
B009HV2JT8|5.0|Great story, great acting - tons of action!!! It probably won't win an oscar this year but this film should be nominated for best picture!
B007TK77QE|2.0|Not a particularly well written story - I'm finding it hard going compared to East of Eden by John Steinbeck.
B009CG2YDE|5.0|Reminds me of some old great games. I recommend this game. I am going to look into other products by these guys.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I always like playing this when I go to eat at the Restaurant after having a good meal.  So I decided to get it and play whenever I wish. It is a little different as the money is not I was not shure when playing it that the things that fall off the front are actually being added to my funds to play with.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved the trilogy, really enjoyed it, it goes into great detail on everything Iike I said i liked it a lot
B0096DFBZQ|3.0|I liked the regular Pac-Man and tried this one.  I only tried it once so far and didn't do too good with it.  I think I will like it after I have time to try it more.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved the trilogy, a lot graphic details but a fantastic read, worth the money! I really liked all three books
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|great game. pretty well made and great graphics. I would continue making more sequels.  great concept and story line. Tell your friends Big Fish has cool games.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love the trilogy, it kept my attention the entire time I was reading, a graphic detailed book, a great read!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Awesome!! Loved this book. Looking forward to the next book. I could not put this one down. A must read.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|I love that you get the different graphics with it but there is not much else you can do with it.  I find it hard to get the camera to view the way you would hold the camera.  It seems the picture is always upside down.  At least for the price it was fun to experiment with.
B003O86FMW|5.0|What can I possibly say about this book that hasn't already been said already?! It is brilliant! I was put off when I first heard that these books were written for teenagers, I wasn't going to bother reading it! But I'm am so glad that I read all three books!<br /><br />I would highly recommend these three books, just make sure you read then in the right order! This is the middle book!!
B004MC0FO8|3.0|It seems to be undecided more than decided on certain programs.  Since I listen to music more in my car than at home it really doesn't help me since I don't have internet connection.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|I did not receive it. I can not review it if I don't have it. I would appreciate it if someone could help me with this issue.
B002C4YYEU|5.0|I have seen this movie before and I loved it.  It's just one of the ones you HAVE to own so you can watch it whenever you want.
B0045XICB2|5.0|love it<br />what more can you say if you actually are a twilight fan, either you love them or hate them and I enjoy a good romance with action any day of the week
B000BQ7BX2|5.0|Brilliant recording of all symphonic works of Mahler. All together, orchester, conductor and recording engeneer, achieved great and brilliant recording.
B008GOG98Y|4.0|Good movie about friendships trying to stay together after highschool is over with a good bicycle story for the avid cyclist.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I love this series....watched season 1 and two on CD's while watching season 3 on Sunday nights while I was on a trip to the UK.  I fell in love with it and  ordered it for my Mother for Christmas
1451688091|5.0|I must admit I learned more about President Lincoln from reading this book [[ASIN:0743270754 Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln]]than I had ever known before.  The documentation that is included within the bound version clearly confirms the magnificent effort it took to complete this project and clearly establishes its credibility.  I have recently seen several interviews on the Sunday morning talk shows with the Doris Kearns Goodwin.  She discusses her interaction with Steven Spielberg as he went about producing his movie by the same name.  I'm glad I read the book before seeing the movie because it was helpful to know about the supporting characters.<br />I really enjoyed the movie as it did contrast some aspects of President Lincoln.  The book clearly addresses his interaction with the cabinet (hence the title) but does not so clearly reveal how brilliant President Lincoln's personal involvement and strategy was to get the 13th Amendment through the Congress before the Civil War concluded.  Both the book and the movie deal humanly with the horror and ferocity of the Civil War and the assassination which makes them both suitable for a larger audience.  I think the book and movie would serve as a worthy basis for college level history class.  Lincoln was an extraordinary man, at an extraordinary time in the history of what I still believe to be greatest test of self governing the world has ever known.
0689859414|5.0|My son has recently become fascinated with the Spiderwick series and this little charm was a great addendum to his reading.
B00199B2Z8|4.0|Another great book from the always funny Mr. Bryson! If you want to have fun while gaining wisdom read this book!
B0020M99LC|5.0|I saw his latest movie and wanted to catch up on the new Bond, It lived up to my expection and had me on my seat to the very end. It also had a very surprising ending. If you want excitment and romance rent this movie.
B008FPOIT6|3.0|I liked the storytelling here, marrying old books with technology of today and the future.<br />Some great lines....<br />&#34;The suburban mind cannot comprehend the emergent complexity of a New York sidewalk.&#34;<br />&#34;Your life must be an open city, with all sorts of ways to wander in.&#34;
B0041B4H1M|4.0|This movie was exactly the one I wanted and remebered. The case came damaged but luckily the disc wasn't. Good entertainment
160774273X|4.0|ordered accidentally but it turned out to be a very good book. excellant for making artisan style breads.My wife likes it..
B0072A3OGS|5.0|I'm gonna start by saying I'm no pro at reviewing albums. But with that said I have opinions and sometimes they match the consensus, other times not so much. I got this album after just hearing a sample. And when I read that it was a concept album about Celtic  pagan tribe and their fight/struggles I was sold.  Musically it is very well put together. Great traditional pipes and flutes mixed with metal guitar and drums and a singer with a great growl.  Myself I am not usually a fan of female singers in metal bands, but the lady in this band changed my views on that. From her clean singing (which is quite lovely) to here primal anger filled war scream at times.  My personal favorite track is scorched earth. A song sung all in Gaelic. Some will hate the fact it's an acoustic song with a voice some pipes and atmospheric noise in the background, but this friggin' metal head digs the skill and the chilling haunt of this song. There are many of song that is good on this album as well. Check it out if your a fan of Turisas and their story telling folk/ adventure metal.  Also fans of in flames could even dig this due to the lead singers voice and the guitar work on this album. Again I'm no pro reviewer but these are my opinion as a fan of the genre and a metal head.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It took me almost to the end of the first \\"book\\" to really get into this book but once I was hooked that was it. I had no more life until I was done reading the whole thing. This was just an amazing book as anyone can tell by the reviews. There just isn't enough good I can say about this book!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This was a great book and would recommend it to anyone. I can not wait for the next one to come out.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My 2 grandsons are always looking for apps to play on my phone. Well since I found KIndle fire, I have them hypotized with the Angry birds, they are 5 yrs old and the eye and hand co-ordination is the best thing around for them. They don't fight to play this game, this is one game they wait to take turns at. I would recommend this game very highly for preschoolers and early school age children. Even us old Grandma's love it.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|Love this story.  Blu Ray is awesome.  Extras are nice.  The movie Rocks. Right now, it is cheap so get it.
B009NPKTN6|2.0|Good music and singing but not worth full attention or money. Wish I had borrowed and played in the background while trimming my toenails
B00992CF6W|5.0|it was surprising it updated on thanksgiving (or so). when is 0.6.0? what's in it? please answer me Ba k!
B00A135YUW|5.0|Wasn't expecting it to be as good as Born; but it is as addicting and replayable as her debut. Excellant stuff and its not your norm radio friendly recycles you hear 100 times to many.
B009LK6JS2|5.0|It is a great flying game that requires a good bit of skill and coordination. I wish they had more.
B002GYI9C4|3.0|The story and mythology is interesting, engrossing even. But the writing is atrocious. The jokes are trite and the characters are so flimsy and 1-dimensional, its tough to stand.<br /><br />I doubt I will even attempt to finish the series. The story was cool. I can certainly see how people would enjoy it. But, seriously, it seems like it was written by a 13 year-old away at writing camp.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I ordered the game for my soon-to-be five year old grandson and he just loved it!  He plays all the Angry Birds games on my Kindle Fire.  I would highly recommend this game because he say it is FUN!
B00A77II0U|5.0|My wife and I stayed up all night playing . I want more! It has an interesting story and uses a doll house for its theme and keeps on playing for hours .
B009B4ZEMA|5.0|I wasn't even thinking of buying Lotus, but I found it at Walmart for five dollars during Black Friday sales. Christina has a powerful voice, but her last few albums have been horrible. I wasn't expecting anything from Lotus, but I ended up loving it. Finally she has gotten rid of the experimental music that brought down her vocals. The album features many dance songs like Red Hot Kinda Love and Make the World Move which features Cleo Green. My favorites are Sing For Me, Blank Page, Cease Fire, and Just A Fool.<br /><br />The Songs Are:<br /><br />1. Lotus Intro<br />2. Army of Me<br />3. Red Hot Kinda Love<br />4. Make the World Move (Featuring Cleo Green)<br />5. Your Body<br />6. Let There Be Love<br />7. Sing For Me<br />8. Blank Page<br />9. Cease Fire<br />10. Around The World<br />11. Circles<br />12. Best of Me<br />13. Just A Fool (with Blake Shelton)
B008TRUDAS|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  The characters are fantastic.  I had never heard of slam poetry before but am interested in it after reading this book.
B007K87C4M|4.0|I picked this up  on account of being a fan of Porcupine Tree's and Opeth's music. This collection sounds like it's more a Steven Wilson project than a Mikael Akerfeldt project. The Blu-Ray disc contains the album in surround sound plus versions of the songs without the already spare vocal tracks or, in one case, as a demo.<br /><br />This is a good CD to put on the player on a rainy day. It's of moody and melancholic -- definitely not party music.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|A Wanted Man is like reading about a chess match.  Every piece is described in detail with the specs and the color and how long the move takes.  Jack Reacher has turned into who is going to play him in the movie....Tom Cruise.  Reacher is 6'6\\"  Cruise is a dwarf.  Ending was horrible.  Child's books were impossible to put down,  Now they are hard to pick up.  2 of the last 3 Reacher books<br />have been horrible.<br />There are too many good authors to continue reading what Lee Child writes.  I have read every Reacher book and ordered them before reviews were available.  Now I will read reviews first.
0316227706|5.0|I love this photographer. The photos he takes are from such an interesting perspective. Nice sized book. Great for any dog lover. It was a shame that the book arrived with the dust cover damaged. Probably should be packed with plastic wrapping when it is shipped with other products (I had mine shipped with the christmas wreath)
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|I grew up in a Lego-free home, with three sisters. I NEVER had any interest in Legos as a child.  I postponed acquiring Legos for as long as possible, because I didn't want them all over the place.  (I know, I'm a terrible mom!) anyway, my husband just bought this game.  he desperately longs for family game night, but it has never worked out, because Our kids are 7, 5, and baby, and usually everyone is frustrated and bickering before we can even get the game set up.  I was afraid I would hate this game because I don't know how to build with Legos!  My daughter was also very skeptical.  We opened this game, figured it out and got started lickety-split, even while juggling the baby.  We played beyond the suggested 5 points, because we were having such a good time!  I won!  It's true, there was a little helping here and ther, and a bit of hint-giving, but if you are playing with little kids, this is normal.  Seriously: playing Candyland or UNO with this family is a nightmare, but this was really fun.  Objectively, probably overpriced, but I don't mind.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|Camera works great and it easy to use. Pictures looked great. Too bad the tablet doesn't have a camera lens facing out.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I'm kind of a sap, so it would probably be an understatement to simply say that I loved this series.<br /><br />I would recommend it to anyone with a romantic side!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Maybe you have to be over 50 or 60 to fully appreciate this film but to my mind it was a complete joy.  Right up there with Peter O'Toole in Venus.  Anything Bill Nighy and Maggie Smith has gotta be good.  Loved it loved it loved it.
B009SQQRH2|5.0|Suitable for young children as there is no &#34;villan&#34;  There were so many details for the adults we had to watch it twice :)
B00846F1YW|3.0|While most of this game is challenging it is also very frustrating! You need to be able to move about the screens without being penalized time. You should be able to position and move your fingers to explore the screen without penalty.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Very entertaining!  Keeps you on your toes and is a great brain teaser if you don't use undo. Try two suits and really be challenged.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Alawar delivers again! Great story; awesome graphics and sound effects. Love the ease in navigating and the hints and strategic guide when you get stuck. Can hardly wait for the next hidden objects game from Alawar!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I absolutely Loved it and so did our family!! The story line was precious and the graphics were amazing!! Wonderful!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book is written with an interesting perspective and has really unique sentence structure and word choice. The story is well thought out and haunting. I liked this book and would recommend it
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Once again sparks wrote a wonderful book!!  He never ceases to amaze me!!!  Beautiful story I highly recommend!!  Awesome book!
B003NHRIVQ|5.0|great story and Miley Cyrus was exceptional she acted the part with out fault<br />well recommended , very happy with the purchase
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I wasnt going to purchase this i bought it on accident i thought i had clicked the first book in the trilogy but it was a mistake anyways i decided to keep it since im going to read all of them so its ok. (:
0061730335|5.0|This book touched my heart in ways I'D NEVER EXPERIENCED BEFORE!  Perhaps the fact that a friend of mine is a missionary and will be spending the next three years in MALAWI. This man as a boy endured hardships beyond my imagination AND STILL had the drive to make life better for his family and even for his village!! Would love the opportunity to meet this man!!<br /><br />I'd encourage everybody to read this book...it can't help but make one feel so priviledged to live here in America!!
B0045XICB2|3.0|I didnt really like this movie of the twilight saga it just wasn't all that great. But i needed to watch it before i watched breaking dawn.
B00A2H9L2E|5.0|First off, if you haven't seen the first film, do that prior to watching this one. Not only will this film make better sense, but I consider &#34;Silent Hill&#34; to one of the top 100 horror films of all time. Clearly this film was not as good as the first. For me, the element of surprise was gone. This production also suffered from plot weakness, trite dialouge, and an unconvincing role by Adelaide Clemens as the lead character. I kept thinking how much better this film could have been if Ms. Clemens had swapped roles with Jennifer Lawrence in &#34;House at the End of the Street.&#34;<br /><br />This film picks up years later as Sharon has grown to 18 years of age and has changed her name to Heather...named after Harry's (Sean Bean) grandmother, the first thing I couldn't buy. He is attempting to live as far away from Silent Hill as possible as long as Heather can be driven there in a few hours, another plot point that didn't make sense, but must of evolved for movie time sake.<br /><br />So after tearing the film apart, why would I rate it 5 stars? Because I loved it. The horror aspect was done well. They made effective use of darkness, shadows, strobe effects, background noises, whispers, and deformed faceless humans. It is the same reason we watched a dozen or so Jason, Freddie, Puppet Master, or &#34;Hellraiser&#34; films long after they became trite.<br /><br />There were two great scenes that come to mind in this film: the spider was well done, and the arms through the prison bars scenes I also loved. You will know them when you see them.<br /><br />Parental Guide: F-bombs (I recall 2 by Heather.) No sex. Brief nudity (Rachel Sellan?).
B006YXTRHY|5.0|i love the movie and it was a reasonable price and it gave me a chance to watch it before i watched the second part(:
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great graphics and easy to use product.<br />Its nice to have this on my tablet if ever I get bored!
B0034G4P4Y|2.0|It's OK. I was led to believe by the reviews that this movie was going to be better than it was. Off the charts animation, but the story was just OK.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Great graphics on the HD versions I have purchase for my granddaughters on their visit for the Thanksgiving day holiday weekend. Their ages are from 2-9 years old. Great fun! They could not stop playing!
B0011U5E1S|5.0|This has all the classic songs from Nirvana's catalog all on one CD. Best collection aside from With The Lights Out but that's a box set. This would be a great Christmas gift along with the biography, Heavier Than Heaven. Highly recommended book on all things Kurt Cobain. FYI: if you ever visit Aberdeen, Washington (where he was raised from birth to his teen years) you'll see his mark... &#34;Welcome to Aberdeen&#34; &#34;Come As You Are&#34;.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I had purchased this product especially for school but I have been using this also for personal & work.<br />Great product and easy to use.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Twisting plot, intrigue, and romance make this a very nice read.  This has the quality to be a hit in type and on-screen.  I can't wait for the next in the series to come out. !
B00006JIA4|5.0|I didn't realize how many Queen songs I knew.  This set brings back great memories.  Love it and recommend it to other Queen fans.
B0077ZNCE2|4.0|Love the Series<br />I love the whole Twillight Saga Series and can't wait to see the Breaking Dawn Part two.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is great, it is action packed and will keep you on the edge of your seat. It is well worth it.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|Great game but it is riddled with bugs. Every update seems to make it worse. I am to the point now where the game just crashes every time I enter the store or get a mission. It is very frustrating.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|It was a good movie. A few things were lacking. Maybe if the character's had a a little more background given. But overall if they made a sequel. I'd definitely see it.
B0034G4P80|4.0|Fun story about the viking hero. Good values. Filmed well. Easy to watch the actor. Charm, light action, romance and humor.
B000SEFNMS|5.0|Such a good book, buy it and rethink your life , don't be a dunce and experience what we hace
B0026IWNZ4|5.0|Great family movie, especially for small children.  No violence, lots of humor without age barriers. All seen from the perspective of a young &#34;outcast, stereotyped&#34; pig who overcomes the inaccurate assumptions of who and what he truly is.  Only to prove to be a hero for many.  Instead of an under&#34;dog&#34;, Babe earns his way to a leader.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I highly recommend the Panther.  I kept on reading it until it was finished.  What a really fascinating book! I laughed out loud at some of the funny comments in the book but also found the information about Yemen to be so interesting.  This is a truly great book. The author must have done extensive research.  Hope everyone reads it.
B009SQQRH2|5.0|This was a really good story line that brings in the true meaning of Christmas with a fresh take on the story of how Santa delivers to all the boys and girls. Great for adults and kids.
B000W91RUG|1.0|Employing cheap, tired one liners, \\"The Big Bang Theory\\" is nothing new.  It is not much more than pablum for the masses.  The title is right on, however - a cliche with no relevance.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|This was an impulse buy, I saw it on sale for 20$ and I have been a fan of Sound Of Music. I decided to go ahead and buy it. The disks and all the accompanying material are packaged in a very nice box, with a well designed lining. The material includes an excellent wind up music box that plays a few of my favorite things when wound up. This is a really well made music box, not some cheap plastic chinese import. There is also a hardcover scrap book with anecdotes and pictures from the movie. This can easily make a good coffee table book. There is a reprint of the 1965 theatrical souvenir book that has scene introductions and a set of 6 postcards titled \\"Snapshots from Salzburg\\" All these are besides the blu ray movie, a special edition blu ray, the dvd copy and a music cd. The blu ray is 7.1 HD sound which makes for an excellent musical experience. This is a truly exceptional value for 20$. I felt like a kid opening and looking through each item.
B007UXSPK2|4.0|Typical MI...  Tom really impressed me with his stunts and the movie was actioned packed...  MI is my kind of movie anyways
B009GEAWOU|5.0|I enjoy watching this show with my wife.  We both enjoy the comedy, heart felt moments and Barney's wild antics.
B00A14SQBU|5.0|This album has everything a great album should have! It will definitely leave you craving more of the soulful vocals, delicious collaborations, and saucy attitude.
B002UM5BXW|3.0|I found this book interesting.  Just in the fact that I learned much about Anthony.  I would recommend the read to anyone who like Anthony Bourdain.  It did make me look at restaurants a lot differently.
B0099G4Y26|5.0|This album is very fresh and fun! As usual, Pink delivers a great mix of tracks that are suitable for many occasions. Great buy.
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|Obviously this show is the bomb! Schmidt, Nick, Winston, CeCe, and Jess are all lovable in their own way. Hilarious comfort food for the eyes, ears, and brain. Great to have around for a pick me up.
B00005TQKQ|4.0|Haven't used this product yet so I am hoping it fixes the issue with play back on my old camcorder.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|love it! My son and I can't stop playing it. Gives a whole new meaning to Angry Birds...so much fun!
B0087HT36U|5.0|great game too bad it locks up the phone. Oh yeah would be great if andriod had all the levels that the poison apple does.
B003IVDPC8|4.0|&#34;Live at the Troubadour&#34;. Carole King & James Taylor together in a live performance at The Troubadour. Music you remember with a live audience.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love how it remembers the last problem you put in.  I also like how the backspace works as it should.  Other calculators make you type in the entire problem all over again if you make ONE little mistake!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|My understanding is that this was the authors first book, so I tried to cut her some slack and have an open mind while reading it since many reviewer said that it was poorly written. Poorly written is an understatement. I have to wonder if an editor even read it before it went to print. The repetitive vocabulary and lack if depth in every aspect of the story made it very painful for me to read. The most interesting dialog happened during Christian's and Ana's email exchanges.<br /><br />And as for the sex scenes...I've read more exciting ones in a typical Harlequin romance novel. I was so disappointed and can't even fathom what all the hype was about. The dom/sub aspect of their relationship is not intense enough to be believable and even the &#34;vanilla&#34; sex lacks excitement. There is very little build up, very little detail and then its over. Everything just falls flat.<br /><br />I had to force myself to finish it and I wish I hadn't bothered.
B009186JYI|4.0|One thing to get up-front is that the actual running time of The Producers cut is only 1:02 which is 62 minutes. The Directors cut is only 36 minutes, most of which, appear in the Producers Cut. So, to begin with, one must take the short duration into account. In terms of the footage itself, there is incredible live moments that truly capture lightning. They play live The Last Time, Time Is On My Side, It's Alright, Play With Fire,. During the mini-riots at the Irish & stage invasions it was wild to see some fans jump up on stage & approach each member of the band. There is one scene where 2-3 boys take Brian down off-stage. Leave it to your imagination as to what happens next. One other character that makes sure he was included was Andrew Loog Oldham, who was the band's manager & musical Svengali. Mr. Oldham was responsible for guiding the Stones regarding money, musical direction, and public relations. He seemed to fit in quite rightly with the boys in the band. In the other live musical concerts, they play Everybody Needs Somebody, Pain In My Heart, Round And Round, & Satisfaction. Actually as The Stones were touring, Satisfaction was ruling the charts as # 1. So , essentially, this was the Stones playing live as they were nearing their peak. Their is intimate footage of Mick, Keith, & Brian collaborating on a tune which turned out to be \\"Sittin On A Fence\\". The film captures the boys working together on writing a song. Rather ironic that the tune was actually a throw-a way in the US as it didn't come out unti The Flowers LP came out in 1966. So you have to pay to see The Stones play with such conviction & musical fire. You really only get about 25 minutes of raw, live footage. The reaction of the fans is revealing because you see that The Stones were not yet used to getting mobbed by fans as their popularity exploded. Eventually, they would get used to it. The Special Features were not really Special. A 4 minute doc on the restoration process plus interviews already shown do not make a Special Feature section. The restoration is good but one must consider that the original was source was from 16 mm stock. I have early boots of Charlie but they are pretty washed up & fragmented. To me, with the Stones coming out with The Last Time, Satisfaction, & Get Off Of My Cloud, you just can't beat the 65 Stones, when Brian was still with them. Brian does emerge as the most shining star in this dvd. If the Documentary were at least 80 minutes, I would give it 5 stars. At the very end of The Producers Cut, you see the Stones carefully crossing the railroad tracks on foot to escape their frenzied fans. The Stones choose to cross the dirty tracks themselves. The shot reminded me of The Beatles running down the main platform to elude fans when George fell down from A Hard Day's Night. There is even a very cool shot of Andrew Loog Oldham laying his head down on the railroad tracks & then lifting it off of the tracks just before a train crosses the tracks. All in all, it depends on how much of a Stone fan you are. If you have the $, then you NEED this dvd. If you don't have the cash, you don't need it right NOW. Down the road, you probably could get it at a cheaper price. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! SMRZ!!!
B005JR3Y5W|4.0|I look forward to this show every week. I wish it was longer because I have to wait a whole week for the next one! Zoey Dechanel's character is too funny!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I really enjoyed the book as an adult, not sure I would recommend it to anyone under the age of 16.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|The grandchildren loved this movie, and I would particularly recommend it for young girls. The storyline is somewhat sugary, but the plot is entertaining.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|Enjoyable movie  make more like this,  good movies  cant come fast enough.<br /><br />I was curious at first  but  felt it was a very good movie
B008GXHOFW|3.0|I dont know how many times I can take the same story being made into a movie. It's one thing to change characters and have a new movie but this is the same story just released a few years ago. So even though the new actor is OK and the movie was not bad I am tried for the lack of imagination from Hollywood.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|I would recommend it to others it was very good  I love action moives  can't get enough new good movies  just went to the theater  it doesnt seem like much new coming out is very good
B002LFPAUC|5.0|Great package, the new interviews are a tad depressing as the actors all seem to have alzheimers now, they're elderly citizens. Cleese seems to have had a bit too much to drink on top of it but it was most enjoyable to watch these shows in pristine condition and no PBS screwups involved for a change!
B00005JPKE|5.0|Well done movie by Clint Eastwood.  Shows all sides on one of the most horrific battles in the Pacific Theater.  A must see.
B009WUBERW|5.0|I LOVED IT ,BUT DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WHEN IT'S HD AND YOU PLAY IT ON MY HD KINDLEFIRE HD ,THE PICTURE COME ACROSS MORE SMALL THAN THE FULL SCREEN IS
B003O86FMW|5.0|The book keeps you wrapped in the story. Never leaving you to pause before the surprise turn. Best adventure in quite a while.
B005J2UM9S|3.0|Grave encounters is your typical hollywood ghost film. There is nothing special about the film that distinguishes it from others, but might be fun to watch with a date or whatever.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This one was so much better than the first, although the first was wonderful!  I couldn't put this book down!  I'm buying the third one on my Kindle RIGHT NOW!
B009C7JS14|5.0|I really love this app it gives me the information I need and the graphics for day, night, rain etc. are great...
B001TCHDPS|5.0|So I can't imagine how I missed Rodriguez when I was growing up but it's never too late to enjoy this marvelous musician!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I LOVE THIS app. all u need to do is reach level 4 Wichita I did in 5 minutes<br /><br />LLLLLLOOOOOOVVVVVVVVVVEEEEEEEEEE THIS APPPPPP..........
B008GOGB6Y|5.0|This is a great movie on so many levels.  It certainly is not just a cycling movie.  I would recommend this as a must see.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I have a cheapo 2.0 Polaroid Android tablet. Had no problems at all. game is lots of fun and very silly. Its easy but still lots of fun to play.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|It drags along too much. The story could be told in half the space. It takes way too long to reach the meat of the story
B00101ZOTA|4.0|It might have started off slow, but it sure got going and the ending is great.  I will rent it again to share with a friend.
B0045XKJBI|5.0|I thought I was purchasing a DVD as I have tentinitis and need closed caption which the streaming products does not have.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series is fantastic!  We hope it continues on for years to come!  The casting is so great and the actors really get into their parts!
B008X8RSTM|5.0|I had this on my Iphone and it ws great. On the Kindle it is very helpful since it doesn't require wii fii and can be used in the car of the field.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|Well. It's got Ryan Gosling in it so you can't go wrong. Pretty much the best movie ever next to the Harry Potter series.
1451695195|5.0|Wonderful book based on experience of a journey to Heaven and back.  I found that it offeered hope to me as well as Christians everywhere
B004QKNXIQ|3.0|Decent remake.  Animation is high quality.  Not quite a Pixar take but my kids love it.  I recommend it at least once.
B009LA1R34|5.0|Me encanta todo este CD.... Los arreglos musicales exelentes la vos de thalia madura segura una delicia y Las canciones hermosas....gracias a Thalia y a su equipo por recordarno q todavia se hace buena musica.....
B001NEK2GE|4.0|Is somewhat useless but this little device transformed my gaming experience and I am very happy with it.  I recommend for any game not just WoW.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Need I say more? If you like it, watch it. If you don't, go see what the kardashians are up too...
B00A14SQBU|5.0|xtina Rocks again..<br />Amazing..amazing vocal...<br />What a voice!!!<br />I totally enjoys listening all her new songs...:)<br />Great Job Xtina !!!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Works very well. Easy to use. Like the colors and tile designs. I enjoyed playing this game. Would recommend it to anyone who likes matching games.
B003AVMUSG|3.0|I purchased this in a store on deep discount.  The kids think it's great, however I am very disappointed in the workmanship of BRIO.  Many parts are just plain plastic, and were already falling apart, not even out of the box for a full 24 hours.  I was very excited when I found this on discount, because I always thought BRIO was a brand that was top notch.  In reality, this BRIO product is not much better quality than most store brand wooden train sets, and it's definitely not worth it to buy it at listed price.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|The kids enjoyed this latest version of the birds, and in a few months once they release extra levels it may be worth the extra money paid for it.  In the initial release, there are only two main groups of levels and an additional group that you can purchase for $1.99.  Based on the previous games in the series, I wasn't expecting that.<br /><br />In the end if they continue to release levels like their other games, then I have no problem with the price.  Just leaves a bit of a bad taste right now.
1419701533|5.0|My Grandson loves these books! I believe he's read them all! I would definately purchase the next version for him!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|been looking for a calculator and this one serves the purpose. no major downfalls that I have found. l especially like the large readout and keypad. works great on the kindle fire.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Bottom line - its in my top ten of best movies ever. I wish they made a sequel but I'm happy with just the original. A MUST have
B00A4CHZ2K|5.0|I will admit I loved P.P. on A .I. But was worried what the powers at AI would try to do to Phillips CD...<br />I am sooo glad to say that I loved what he did and more importantly DIDN'T do...<br />Not the over produced glop you usually get from Idol.. Just sound like Phillip Phillips!<br />I really liked it from start to finish, and am so happy the likable guy from Georgia made an Album<br />He can be proud of.
B009CG2YDE|4.0|if you like tiny robots you will like this game.looks like the same type of game. I liked tiny robots so this is a fun game to me.
B0074EIQUG|2.0|I must validate some of the poor reviews here. First, I'm an avid Dr John Fan and just saw him last week live. Great Show per usual. So I bought the CD to add to my dozen or so Dr John CD's. Huge disappointment! This Production was awful and I'm sure Mac had no idea how terrible the finished product would be. It's terribly recorded on lousy equipment producing horrible thin irritating sound. No excuse in 2012. Oh and I have a great $15K set up which only highlights the<br />poor quality recording. The songs are great and the lower 911 did a fabulous job live. Now I guess I have to wait for another live recording that does these tunes justice. Love ya Mac, but you got into a bad bunch with these 'producers' and 'recording engineers'. Mac, not up to your high standards, stay away from these uncool cats in the future. We still love you and the Lower 911. Hope to see you again soon.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I thought it was really sad about who died, especially when* SPOILER ALERT* Prim died....<br /><br />Great book. I read all 3 books and loved them all. If only this series could go on...
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Fun little game that's pleasant to return to regularly.  It's actually nice that you run out of coins and have to wait for them to build up again-- it means you can't waste *too* much time at once on the game.  Also I find the low level excitement of coming back to my phone to find that my coins are completely regenerated to be another unexpected little pleasure of the game.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This is a great story that kept me up all night reading it. It is basically the story of an astronaut who is accidentally stranded on Mars because the rest of the crew thinks he is dead and they were not able to recover his body before they had to evacuate. Rather than curling up into a fetal position and dying, he keeps using his head and \\"working the problem\\" in order to survive until he can be rescued. This story is set roughly twenty years from now. If you have any kind of science, engineering or military background, you will very likely love this story and the overall attitude behind it. If you don't know much about Mars, you will probably learn quite a bit about it from this book.<br /><br />The main big error has to do with how forceful that high velocity winds would be in the low pressure atmosphere on Mars. I also think that the communications difficulties are a little exaggerated. Right now, we currently have several orbiters over Mars that are able to communicate via line of sight with our two active rovers on Mars. In the story, the stranded astronaut has two crew rovers that have low power radios that would probably be able to communicate with some of the Mars orbiters that they would have at the time.<br /><br />Finally, several reviewers have complained about the frequent usage of the evil F-word by the characters in the book. Really, they need to get over it. That is simply how most people talk when they are under extreme stress, especially in the military. I am sure it is the same way at NASA/JPL in stressful situations. You don't hear too many people saying \\"Gosh darn it\\" when lives are at stake. But if you will be deeply offended by some realistic profanity, then perhaps you should not read this book.
B000BM61UU|5.0|This is an impressive kit, and I look forward to the challenge of building it. If you're considering this one, keep in mind that it's over 19&#34; long with a wingspan of 22.5&#34;, so make sure you have the space to display it when it's done. Highly recommended for aviation buffs.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Slammed is such a heart wrenching and gut searing read that it had me on the edge of my seat. I have to say that at first I was thinking okay so Layken is 18 and Will is 21 that is not to bad in the age department. That was until I found out why their love is forbidden and that was when my heart broke. Dam I felt like Lake and Will could not catch a break. The phrase two steps forward is two steps back came to mind.<br /><br />Lake has just moved from her life long home. Her father has passed away and she and her mother and brother are moving to start a new life. She has to be strong for her family but on the inside she is crumbling. That is until she meets Will. Lord Will is everything to her. He is smart funny and sexy all wrapped into one. They become fast friends and before you know it they are going on dates and hanging out before Lake returns to school. But what happens next ripped my heart out because Lake and Will are about to experience what true love really is and how hard it is to be with the one you love.<br /><br />Will is Lake's neighbor and when he sees her moving in he goes over to ask her if she needs help. He is soon enraptured by Lake's sense of humor and her warmth. See Will is no ordinary 21 year old. He is raising his brother because his parents died in a car accident. So he and Lake know what it is to lose someone you love the most. Will is still in college and he is almost done with school and his plans are pretty solid as to what he would like to do until he meets Lake and they fall in love.<br /><br />They will have many ups and downs and tragedy will strike one of them again and it will be very difficult to handle. What will the secret do to them? Will they be able to have a relationship? Will they ever be able to not suffer from the casualties of life?
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I have not seen this movie, enjoyed reading this first book. Reminds me of  THE LOTTERY , fiction  book, reminder of how customs need to be changed as we progress in life.
034553154X|5.0|If you are a fan of &#34;Game of Thrones&#34;, then this is the calender for you. Also if you just like sci-fi, swords and sorcery, fantasy then you will be pleased with this statement on your wall.
B0063GORYU|5.0|i was familiar with regular Solitaire, but had never played Spider. It is easy to learn and it allows you to think out different moves to get to your goal. It is also helpful for check the hints when first learning how to play the game.
B00A135YUW|5.0|An EP that's beyond compassion with any of the newly released albums in the Pop/Alternative Music World. Ms. Del Rey finished the era of Born To Die with a melodramatic set of 9 incredible songs that prove her talent and dedication. A must listen, really. Amazed.
B000FA5SMK|4.0|Interesting reading on a probably truer- to- life issue than I'd like to admit! The book is well-written and holds your attention. Recommend.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I enjoy playing this game very much. Graphicsxare great, sound effects are not overwhelming,  and puzzles are challenging.  Look forward to getting more games from Playrix.

B0091XRL86|3.0|Kids enjoyed it and I enjoyed watching it with them. Kids may give it higher rating...as im 45 years old
B0086700CM|2.0|I guess I don't like these games as much as solitaire or scrabble.  I get bored with them, but other people will probably enjoy it.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|Entertaining but I wouldn't go the theater and pay those cost to see it.. far fetched of course but nice to see sitting at home.
0002245841|1.0|Bought this book hoping for the old edition cover as a collecter piece as pictured above, got an overpriced (58.44) copy of the new reprints with the new covers. Not sure how they get off stating it is a hardcover import from 1996, when it has the new reprinted covers and stickers from Manchester Public Library, Whiton Memorial Branch, 100 N. Main St, Manchester CT 06040. Thanks for overcharging me and scamming me out of shipping.
B005FMZWD8|3.0|I hate the strap (bad ) and it is made of a poor materials but as an over all watch 99 $ it is not bad
B004HX4RT6|4.0|I enjoy this game very much.  I have not been able to determine any mistakes made by the the Kindl Fire but all of my misplays have all resulted in humbling defeats.
B009NQKXYK|2.0|I found this video less than adequate for entertainment value. It seemed slow and ponderous at points. It definately could use some pumping up to keep me interested. I watched the entire feature, but I would not want to sit through it again. The mystery promised by the cover page and introduction was not delivered from my point of view.
B009SQRC9E|5.0|funny moive for all ages, well worth the price. Nice to have on demand instead of a clutter of dvds.
B000LX00RY|5.0|Who's never had a boss like this?! I purchased the movie to watch over and over again. Loved the fashion, makeup, intrigue and romance.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This is just the cutest film. The animation and colors and design are amazing , I wish I was as talented as these people. But all that aside it has wonderful story and it teaches great lessons. But it is just a fun happy lovely film. The young lady that plays the young girl is beautiful she has a lovely voice. Love love this movie.
B008SVFX96|5.0|Long awaited and not disapointed. Richie took us through a whole bunch of stuff going on in his life through music. This album is worth it. All the way. It's got a little something for everyone. Granted seeing him live is amazing (as a solo artist) so if you cant do that do this. Go out and get a copy of Aftermath of The Lowdown. Great album from an even greater artist. It did not disappoint. It's pure Richie. He gave us influences from different sources. From Black keys to Blues. They don't call him Mr. Bluesman for nothing. A must for any Christmas list.
B0031RS894|4.0|If it had been more substantial it would have gotten a five star rating.  Great book, just disappointingly short.  Four stars
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I bought for a friend, and she seems to like it.<br />I don't know much information about this item actually.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Her style of electric dance with violin weaved in and out and all the way thru is so unique and fascinating you can't help but be sucked in! That and the fact that the songs are just plain fun to listen to. Its a total win! I dare you to listen to &#34;Shadows&#34; and not smile. I double dare you.

B00000IMTF|5.0|I have always loved Ronnie James Dio. I loved Deep Purple in my middle school days while everyone else listened to rap I would imagine playing the lead guitar for Smoke on the Water infront of everyone. In my youth I thought it would be cool if Dio and Deep Purple did an album together. Friends, to my amazment as a child, that is sort of what happened here. Rainbow Rising is a masterpiece handsdown. My fear is that my generation will forget about actual music. Music that didn't talk about banging girls or getting drunk, partying, and well banging girls. Music that had a deeper meaning, one that had soul, emotion, an album that had its own personality. Here is that album. The first track, Tarot Woman, has my favorite intro of any metal, rock, any song. The keyboard is SO amazing. Run With The Wolf, is catchy and powerful so is the next track Starstruck. Do You Close Your Eyes, is one of those songs I can not describe. When I listen to it, I can't think to myself, I get wrapped up in the music. Stargazer and A Light In The Black, finish this album out strong and they are both my personal favorite songs. Overall, it should be mandatory that this be on the shelf of anyone that likes rock, metal, or classical music. Yes it is THAT good.

B003L77G8I|5.0|To resuscitate a dead team out of their scattered disappearance is not an easy task. Luckily the DA in Washington DC is a powerful woman, stubborn and resolute, and she generally gets what she wants. So she brought Agent Booth back from Afghanistan, and Temperance Brennan, aka Bones, from the exotic place where she was trying to get some archaeologically interesting bones with Daisy, Dr Sweet's girl friend, and Dr Sweet from his hideout somewhere in Paris where he was having a showbiz career as a cabaret singer. They all come back, change clothes and back in the business in a jiffy they all are. Angela and Dr Hodgins are also back though from not so far away and Angela is pregnant. Don't worry the delivery will go just fine, and their fear of some handicap will be unfounded. They will celebrate at the end of the season.<br /><br />But this season is a lot more interesting than just those circumstantial collateral disagreements or pleasure.<br /><br />As usual one case per episode, clean and neat, always dealing with a lot of bones, gross and dirty, soaked in a lot of decomposed muck with a tremendous number of maggots, worms and other corpse parasites. A series not to watch while eating anything more delicate than dry cookies.<br /><br />The interest is first the relations among the people in the series and these relations include some personal data on each case. Dr Saroyan has the case of her daughter to solve who is supposed to start her college years. The mother cannot cope with the idea of her following her boyfriend to some community college in some county of some northern New England state nearly in Canada but is it ethical to cheat the system and get her accepted in Columbia University, if it is Columbia University (you can check that one out), on a fake file? It is amazing what parents are at times ready to do that is so absurd and goes against the grain of their profession and personality. Will the girl accept to enter a top university on a fake file? That is the real question. Will the daughter teach a lesson to her own mother? Not so simple.<br /><br />Of course Angela and Dr Hodgins have a full plate with the pregnancy and the delivery of the baby. For them that's enough and that will require some help from a friendly psychiatrist because it is hard for the father not to become overprotective and it is hard for the mother to accept the physical handicap this pregnancy may represent. Yet they decided that working with the people they are used to work and live with was the best thing for the pregnancy, the mother and the child. Angela was not alone at any moment of her days or nights.<br /><br />Agent Booth brought a journalist back from Afghanistan, a sort of love substitute for Temperance. But will that not cause some problems, like conflicting interests between the two professions? And Booth with his own son is already very busy in life. Will that new woman in the picture be able to cope with a child, what's more the child of another woman? And the question of marriage will come up sooner or later and how are the two going to react to that eventuality? Probably not very well, maybe not too bad. A decision that is always difficult to take for someone who is constantly in the field of police investigation and for a journalist just back from a war zone and who may consider Washington DC as another war zone. Do you get married and build a home and a family when you are in a war zone?<br /><br />There is of course the case of Booth and Temperance. It did not work the first time, but will there be a second time? Why not? They are both young enough to think about their independence and old enough to start thinking about settling down in some kind of normal place. But of course Booth is not free and temperance is mature enough to keep up appearances.<br /><br />Then you have the interns still rotating, the four of them. They are the surprise of each episode because they are so different and they can be so funny, though attimes they are just funny for us because they are mismatched with what is happening around them, but that's what interns are all about. Unluckily one will end up very badly. That's not the first case, but so far none had ended up that badly. But a song will carry him through: lime and coconut, sung in a chorus all together, mellow and heart stirring.<br /><br />There will be a case that will run over the whole season, the case of a sniper who had been a colleague and friend of Booth in Afghanistan and who came back slightly berserk and decided that what he did over there was good enough for the USA too and he started killing those who were rotten, and those who were in his way for his type of justice and these were only collateral victims for him, hence justified by the end. It will take the whole team to stop him and it will bring a lot of suffering and even mourning to that team.<br /><br />Then there are 23 cases in this season and I would advise you to watch them if you haven't yet or watch them again if you have already.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUtimes they are just funny for us because they are mismatched with what is happening around them, but that's what interns are all about.

B00271SFB6|5.0|Excellent movie, we rented it over Thanksgiving on my Sony media player because some members of my family had not seen it before. The quality and playback were perfect with the regular HD setting, so I'd say it was worth the $3.99 rental fee.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|This was a good read, but not great. I read &#34;Gone Girl&#34; first, which WAS great!!!!!! This story was a little thin in some parts with predicable character development. This is a fast read.
B003Y5USF0|5.0|This is a great movie with an awesome cast. The soundtrack rocks. And if you love guitar...check out Eddie Van Halen's closing song &#34;Respect the Wind&#34;
