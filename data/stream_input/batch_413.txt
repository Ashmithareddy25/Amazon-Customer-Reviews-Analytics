B0001WTUH6|2.0|I was a bit disappointed with the original release:  major plot holes, choppy action sequences, lousy soundtrack, total waste of the picture-perfect setting of Budapest, cramped character development and a hokey ending.  Still considering the budget they had to work with, it was impressive enough as a first film.<br />So I picked up the extended cut.  Blah. It didn't fix any of the problems. There is nothing on the disc (for the film) that isn't included in the novelization (which was, sad to say, poorly written).  If you've read it, you don't need to see the extended cut.  If you haven't read it...the book is cheaper.  <br />This disc makes for a better rental than a personal purchase.
B000063UR2|5.0|Okay, I haven't seen the DVD yet, but I will, very, very soon. I just want to recommend this movie to anyone who is a Tom Cruise fan, unicorn lover, and to anyone who loves to see Tim Curry as the ultimate devil. (I always thought he played the ultimate bad guy). When I heard that Legend was a European import and the US version I saw of the movie sucked compared to its original release, I knew I had to get it, because, if I loved the Us release, how much will I love the original version? I must know!I put a rating of five stars 'cause I'm very sure this DVD rocks!
B000066NW0|1.0|This is hilarious. How dare this chick from Canada parade around thinking she is Johnny Thunders or Sid Vicious. She thinks she is so punk, strutting around with her dumb guitar and singing dumb lyrics with awful titles like the unbearably cheesy Sk8ter Boi. Talk about dumb. But there are moments on the CD when she wnders into the territory of being not-bad-enough-to-make-you-puke. But it still is almost hilarious that this pompous little girl wanders around thinking she is SO punk. It ain't gonna happen. Go back to where ya belong, little idiot.
B00018D44U|1.0|Well, I didn't buy it, my wife did, but I have to listen to this sludge on a regular basis. When I listen to music, I expect to have some emotional involvement, intellectual stimulation, and preferably both. What you get with THIS CD is an annoying, sung-through-the-nose tapestry of tapioca, a veritable wall of white noise. Each song sounds the same as the one before it, and the next one sounds like the one three songs ago. If this is music for a &quot;mature audience&quot;, it's &quot;mature&quot; as in &quot;time for your meds&quot;. This isn't &quot;relaxing&quot;, it's zombified. This certainly isn't an artistic experiment or catharsis: it's the most blatant, commercialized, homogonized, pasteurized and PACKAGED CD I've been subjected to this year. And the lyrics? Duke Ellington is probably spinning right now: Nora's lyrics to his &quot;Melancholia&quot; (the end product is mercifully re-titled &quot;Don't Miss You At All&quot;, which is how I'd feel if the CD flew out the car window) are embarassingly banal and repetitive. Obviously there's an audience for this, but I must assume that the biggest fans are the ones who haven't heard anything original, or who are so traumatized that this musical thorazine is what they're craving.
B0000029AL|4.0|One of the local classic-rock radio stations in St. Pete has been playing &quot;Dream On&quot; a lot for the last month or so and I really should be tired of it by now, but instead, when I realized that the band who originally recorded it and the band I know as Aerosmith are the same thing, I couldn't get enough of it.  That was really Steven Tyler back in the day?  So today I finally purchased a copy of the group's first album because I was so stuck on this &quot;proto-Aerosmith&quot; sound and was hungry for more.  Over the last few hours since I got it, I've been listening to it off and on to get it under my skin, with the result thus far being that it's not extraordinary but it's on the right track.  The band sounded much different from the way it did in the 1980s, 1990s, and today.  The music is much more pared down (not a bad thing), down to just the basic instrumentation of the actual band without all of the bells and whistles present in their later music.  If you don't know it's them you're listening to, you won't recognize them as Aerosmith, but the bluesy elements of most of the songs on the album are indicative of things to come later in the '70s (this album was released in 1973).  Other than a few occasional yelps and wails, Steven Tyler sings with a completely different style than what he used in subsequent recordings.  I thought this was fascinating and I think if you're a young fan who isn't familiar with much of their catalogue, like me, you might like to go back and become familiar with this debut album so you can hear how much the band evolved over the last three-plus decades.  Standout songs are &quot;Dream On&quot; (of course), &quot;One Way Street&quot;, &quot;Mama Kin&quot;, &quot;Write Me&quot;, and &quot;Movin' Out&quot;.
0393324818|4.0|Moneyball makes a great read for both the baseball enthusiast as well anyone looking to study a truly remarkable business model that transcends mere baseball.  For example, when replacing All-Star 1B Jason Giambi, Oakland GM Billy Beane says, &quot;The important thing is not to recreate the individual.  The important thing is to recreate the aggregate.&quot;<br />In a highly unconventional, yet meticulously precise system of player development that drafts such players as C Jeremy Brown in the 1st round(he wasn't listed among the top 25 amateur Catchers by Baseball America), signs such castoffs as a C who can't throw from his throwing arm(Scott Hatteberg), lead-footed Jeremy Giambi, over-the-hill David Justice, Assistant GM Paul DePodesta says, &quot;We don't get the guys who are perfect.  There has to be something wrong with them for us to get them.&quot;<br />&quot;When you rule out an entire class of people from doing a job simply by their appearance, you are less likely to find the best person for the job.&quot;<br />- Michael Lewis
B000066C6Z|5.0|Top Secret! - the Jim Abrahams/Zucker Bros.' follow-up to Airplane! - does for (or is that *to*) Elvis movies and WWII espionage films what the earlier feature did for/to the airborne disaster genre. The gags are slightly more immature (not necessarily a bad thing, but in some cases may have been better had they been allowed to age a little before being put into production), but some, like the forced-perspective oversize phone or saying farewell to the Scarecrow, rival anything the ZAZ team has ever done. <br />The music is a mixed bag. &quot;Skeet Surfing&quot; and the Macy's jingle are great. &quot;Tutti-Fruitti&quot; and &quot;Straighten the Rug&quot; are less so (not that every song in an Elvis movie was worthy of screen time, either). Kudos to Val Kilmer, though; even when he's camping it up, the musical numbers remain watch- and listenable.<br />The only thing I don't care for on the disc is the audio commentary. The production team really rips the movie apart as if they had tried to make a &quot;serious&quot; film that fell apart. In that case, learning why/how it failed would be interesting and instructive. To shred a spoof film, especially a sophomore and sophomoric effort like Top Secret!, is entirely unwarranted. Sure there are plot holes. Sure it makes no sense that submarine would crash into a prison dungeon. Sure some things are only mildly amusing. Drawing undue attention to them is doubly pointless. Sheesh! If you're a big fan, skip the commentary.<br />I really enjoyed this movie and really (mostly) enjoyed its presentation on the DVD. There aren't a lot of extras, but be sure to hunt for the Easter Egg - it's definitely worth finding.
B000148KK2|5.0|Ones and fives are a good sign.  This cd is adventurous and a step in the right direction.  You can feel a mean-spirited attack from all of those reviewers who think this is a poor effort.  Ignorance seems to be at the heart of those who would criticize in such a fashion.  Beautiful songs, fine arrangements, incredibly uplifting and optimistic music.
B000001ESF|5.0|The title of this review is not meant to be a slight at all. But this album encapsulates all the tricks of early King Crimson. especially KC's RED.<br />KC cleared the path and RUSH made it popular, with spectacular results. The song &quot;tears&quot; is the throw back to the first couple of King Crimson Albums, and the rest of 2112 builds on the promise of KC's Red album.<br />Essential stuff for any prog-rock fan and anyone interested substantial music. Rush built it's own ediface with A Farewell To Kings and Hemispheres that followed this release. Astounding abums all!<br />Just Get it.
0790749815|5.0|Does it get any better than North by Northwest? Not much.  The sublime confluence of Hitch's masterful directing, Cary Grant's suave (and humorous) acting, the beautiful and charming (and not to mention smoothly debonair) Eva Marie Saint, the cunningly clever screenplay, singularly superb setting (including the thrilling climax at Mt. Rushmore as well as the iconic scene of the cropduster buzzing Grant in the middle of nowhere), and, of course, the exceptional music score all help immeasurably in molding the aesthetic dynamic and, in essence, make the film what it is - a certifiable masterpiece.<br />One note of interest: on the train ride when they first meet, Eva Marie Saint's line to Cary Grant of &quot;I never discuss love on an empty stomach&quot; is actually dubbed over the originally spoken line of &quot;I never make love on an empty stomach&quot; in acquiescence to the studio suits.
B0001HLVSC|5.0|This is a very good movie for guys; can't imagine too many women enjoying this movie, but if you're out there - my hats off to you!  If you're a child that has to be constantly entertained by fast-moving stories and special effects, maybe you should get Disney's &quot;Aladdin&quot;.  For those of us who are able to appreciate what life may have been like a few hundred years ago on a war ship, this movie delivers.  As someone else stated, this movie succeeds at most by showing us war-life in this time era.  It has some intense moments and some fun battle scenes, but the heart of the story lies with everyone's interaction with each other.  Most of the acting is decent, but Russell Crowe's acting is somewhat dampered in this movie.  Still, it delivers a very good story for men who love war movies.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Well I love Chuck Palahniuk's work and this is an awesome transition from a novel to a film. Dialogue still intact, even though the story line is slightly altered. Actors succeed in bringing Chucks' characters to life and so does the Director in creating the world of Tyler Durden. Amazing book that leads to an amazing movie
B000002KNU|4.0|This is not Talking Heads' best album - fans tend to rate any one of their four subsequent studio releases - but it's definitely worth having. Quirky, poppy and slightly amateurish, it has a sound all of its own. The emphasis is squarely on David Byrne's songs, to which the band are at this stage subordinated, and the songs are pretty much uniformly great. The best known is of course Psycho Killer, a jarring and twisted number written from the point of view of a (surprise) psycho killer, but there is better fare on offer here. Don't Worry About The Government, Uh-Oh, Love Comes To Town, Happy Day and Book I Read are all cheerfully deranged masterpieces; Byrne's ability to write a song in character is utilised to the full, as is his ability to explore themes that other lyricists just wouldn't think of: who else could write a line like 'some civil servants are just like my loved ones'? However, the album's crowning glory is Pulled Up, an ecstatically cheerful pop song which, in its middle eight, showcases the band's ability to 'be funky' with a sparse guitar riff, wonderful bassline and soaring tune.<BR>But it's not perfect by any means - when Byrne runs out of decent tunes the songs fall flat on their faces because the band don't quite have the chemistry going on that they did over the next few albums. Songs like Who Is It are lightweight and throwaway, and although they're not particularly bad, I certainly wouldn't have bought the album if they were all like that. Maybe this lack of chemistry was simply because the band were entering the studio to record an album for the first time and their nerves got the better of them - certainly they had a great reputation as a live band at around the same time - but they do bring the album's star rating down a notch. But if you've bought and liked any of their albums, you should enjoy this.
B00016ZR2O|5.0|This album is really great and I love it. Very highly recommended. So is Mer de Noms. Excellent albums
B0000AQS0F|5.0|First off I want to make this clear, don't buy this if you're expecting Sci-Fi television.  There are no spacial anomalies, no hyper-intellient shades of blue (although that would be kinda cool).  There are no phasers, no space battles and absolutely no perfect people wandering through space and saving the universe from whatever is troubling it this week.<P>This is a show about people, who just happen to live in the future.  They're all from very different backgrounds, which just happen to be different planets.  They're stuck in a small space together often, which just happens to be a spaceship.  As with any Joss Whedon show, the dialog is clever and witty, and despite often not being how people talk, is very well written.  The effects are beautiful and the musical score is perfect.<P>Make no mistake, this IS a western in space, but it's a damn good one.
0679720200|5.0|The main character of this book is the definition of an antihero and seems to not care about anything. But thats what makes him so likeable and the book such a gem!<br />I cant really explain this book without spoiling it but if you want a terrific and engrossing read then look no further. This book is the thing you seek.
B000002KNY|5.0|This album sounds like Brian Eno's vision of what Talking Heads should sound like - it's funky, superficially danceable and catchy, but simultaneous with those elements is a darkness that hadn't really been seen in their music before (well, come to think of it, they did have a song called 'Psycho Killer', but still...). Take Life During Wartime, for instance: the band is at its funkiest with a great synth riff and solid, pumping drums, and over the top you have David Byrne yelling out deeply menacing lyrics that on at least one interpretation are from the point of view of a terrorist.<BR>Courtesy of Brian Eno, these dark sentiments are echoed by the production - the band is so heavily treated that the music sounds like it's coming straight out of the heart of a machine; Eno was of course recording with the Heads around the same time he was working on the Berlin trilogy with David Bowie, and it shows. The darkness gets most intense with the closing Drugs, based around a sparse, pulsating beat that sounds like slow death. At the end, an atonal, frightening guitar solo bursts out of the gloom, ending the album in a state of total madness.<BR>Amongst all this alienation, however, lies some of Byrne's most affecting work. I'm thinking in particular of Heaven, a song which imagines the afterlife to be a state of unending repetitive bliss rather like that depicted in Aldous Huxley's Brave New World - if indeed Byrne is really talking about the afterlife, the song being equally applicable to many utopian visions of how this world could be shaped. The chorus, the best one he ever wrote, simply runs 'Heaven is a place where nothing ever happens'.<BR>A year later, in 1980, Talking Heads would release Remain In Light, embracing African rhythms with great success (the experiment had already started on this album with the Dadaist I Zimbra). Although that album is possibly the one I recommend you start with, this is a worthy addition to any music collection.
B000009EAD|5.0|This one is right up there with &quot;Dark Saga&quot; with great musicianship(as always with IE) and outstanding vocals by Barlow. Album flows great from start to finish..You won't be disappointed.
B0001I55OC|4.0|Not having any idea what movie I was about to watch, when I went to see timeline in theatres, it instantly became one I couldnt wait to get on DVD!<br />there should be about 100 reveiws already on the movie, so I wont beat around the bush, and explain the plot for the 101st time.<br />Why this movie has been put down so much is suprising to me! So its not accurate to the book? Has any movie based from a book ever been 100%? The movie is BASED on the book, not exactly PAGE TO SCREEN transfer. <br />I havent read the book, so I wouldnt know, but i really dont care, I thought this movie was very good. It was full of action, suspence, bit of sci-fi, bit of love... is there a bunch of rascist reveiwers not liking the fact that France is the good guys in the film or somthing? I saw nothign wrong at all with this film, and thought it was very intresting... it does have a bit of a rocky start that left me wondering \\"what is happening?\\" but it soon sorts it self out and makes sense! Tho, one thing I will say, if any Billy Connely fans have HEARD about this movie, and want to see it because he is in it? Dont expect a barrel of laughs! Theres a small amount of humour, but he is mostly acting on a more serios side!<br />The bonus features I gotta admit are some of the most boring things ive seen! theres 3 behind the scene/on location things that go for about 20 minutes each, they did bore the **** out of me. And the other features where pretty dull and boring too! to me anyway.<br />I think this movie is great, i give it 4 stars, very intresting all the way, and very entertaining!<br />Richard Donnar has done a great film here, and presented it in a way thats not over the top, not going for special FX too much, and filling it with a sense of humour, and of coarse the Donnar magic touch to action.<br />Give it a rent at least. Bugger the book.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|Avenged Sevenfold's second album loses alot of the punk-thrash feel of Sounding the Seventh Trumpet (the snarling vocals are still here) and instead features unclassifiably awesome music. The first song, \\"Waking the Fallen,\\" is kinda weird, but WHO CARES? Because the next song is \\"Unholy Confessions,\\" and then there's \\"Chapter Four!\\" Everything in these songs sounds really good and the despairing lyrics match the music perfectly. \\"Remenissions\\" is so full of real emotion and awesome music that there's no way anyone cannot respect it (the acoustic parts are the best use of acoustic guitars since Metalicca). \\"Desecrate through Reverence\\" is my favorite because of the over-the-top energy in the verses, crescendoing in the end. \\"Eternal Rest\\" starts out with a fast solo and turns slow and heavy. I reccomend reading the lyrics to this one, it makes the song that much creepier-sounding! \\"Second Heartbeat\\" is probably Avenged Sevenfold's best song. The refrain to \\"Radiant Eclipse\\" is strange, but the introduction is really good and is one of the few places on the album where the Reverend Plague shows his insane drum talent in full. \\"I Won't See You Tonight pt. 1\\" is Avenged Sevenfold's version of a ballad, and perfectly matches the angry \\"I Won't See You Tonight pt. 2.\\" \\"Clairvoyant Disease is another personal favorite of mine. \\"And All Things Will End\\" is just as good and has a unique style of ending. Overall the best songs are \\"Remenissions,\\" \\"Desecrate Through Reverence,\\" \\"Eternal Rest,\\" and \\"Second Heartbeat,\\" which form a block of the best music I've ever heard. However, except for the fist song, every song on the CD is incredibly awesome.  The only dissappointment for me in this CD is that the Rev Thollomew Plague's drumming is more sedate than on Sounding the Seventh Trumpet. This fits the music, but it's still a shame because the Rev is the best new drummer I've heard, and on STST he really kicked @$$. I suppose if you're not a drummer like me you don't care. Finalrecommendation: BUY ALL AVENGED SEVENFOLD ALBUMS!
B0001IN0DA|5.0|What a great DVD to own, bought it the first day it came out evntough I saw live when first aired.  The packaging starting from the front cover and the inside folding backround is awesome.  From watching wrestling for so many years, the intensity of this event at Madison Square Garden was spectactular, the crowd was just unbelivable.  I enjoyed mostly every match, with an exeption of a few.  The Crusierweight tournament was completly rushed, not very entertaining.  The evening gown match was just to treat the men, pure entertainment nothing else.  Although I felt it got critisized too much, Goldberg Vs. Lesnar was still a little dissapointing, both men did not show there best stuff, the crowd let them know too, since it was indeed the last match for both men for the company at unless otherwise..  The long stare down at first was not very fun to sit through.  If you watch this match, you may like the crowd reaction more so than the actual wrestling.  The ending was wierd, as Stone Cold shows he is a man.  The ending to the Christian Vs. Jericho match was funny.  Angle Vs. Guerrero was anice solid match, what wrestlemania should be all about.  The main event was a classic, great way to close out the show.  The extra are great, which include Pre and Post match Wrestler Comments.  Many interesting notes from the previuos Wrestlemania'a, Ten Greatest matches, sevral sets of trivia questions, delted scenes, some hidden easter eggs, A phot gallery from all 19 prior Wrestlemani'a with results. Just a great 3-disc.  WWE did a great job with everyting regarding Wrestlemania XX.
B00005YUAC|5.0|Camel was one of the most imaginative bands in the seventies. I bought the vynil album and I haven't been able to buy this CD yet.<br />But when you are in the mood for Camel you won't believe the wide sense of harmonies depicted musically, the clever use of the spanish guitar in several pieces. Think in Arubaluba, for instance, and my favorite track Mystic queen , one of the most striking themes in all that glorious decade. And watch for the amazing bands in that age.<br />Undoubtly, we'll always be in debt with U.K. about resisting the no mercy invassion of the disco music that literally struggled so many raising promise rock bands in USA, specially between 1975 and 1979.<br />Buy that album. This was a true cult band.
B000002LPD|4.0|...this album rocks pretty hard for a Van Halen album with Hagar.If you're looking for cheesy ballads like &quot;Dreams&quot; and &quot;Love Walks In&quot; well this is NOT the VH album for you.On this stint,Van Halen actually sounds like Van Halen again.Alex's thunderous drumming and Eddie's ear shattering guitar work really shine here especially on tracks like &quot;Poundcake&quot; and &quot;Runaround&quot; which find the band rockin' hard like the old days.If i were to point out a weakness on this album,I would have to say it would be the weird &quot;Pleasure Dome&quot; track.Kind of experimental on the band's part and just very &quot;Un-Van Halen-like&quot;.But other than that,this is a hard rockin' album and probably the best with the red rocker.Now that they're back I wonder if they can cook up something real nice after the boring &quot;Balance&quot; album.However that new single is soundin' pretty hard and heavy...hopefully a sign of things to come!LONG LIVE VAN HALEN!!!

Every book starts out with the author saying \\"For Beatrice - my love for you lives on even though you don't...\\"<br />It's all a joke about these themes...the death issues, the disasters that happen to sweet children, and it is central to cruel people.  <br />I often get the impression that the author doesn't really like kids at all.  <br />There are better books like C.S.

6304696566|4.0|John Huston's Searchers is a visually stunning cinematic experience that draws the audience into a five year long obsessive search for the little girl Debbie.  The story begins with war veteran Ethan Edwards (John Wayne) returning home to his brother after having been on the road for years after the Civil War.  However, Ethan does not get to spend much time with his family as they are soon massacred by Comanche's lead by chief Scar.  The only person that seems to have survived is his niece Debbie, and Ethan is determined to find her as he sets out with Martin Pawley (Jeffrey Hunter).  Martin, a half-Indian, is a peaceful and reasonable man who was adopted by the family.  Ethan is the opposite with strong racist beliefs, which trickle out around Ethan's persona.  The story surrounds the violent veteran, Ethan, and the naive innocence of Martin, which sets up strong contrasts between the two characters in the long journey.  This contrast sets up a microcosm of the wild west, which is socially dissected to illustrate how the wild west was tamed.  As the story unfolds the audience experiences a terrific cinematic event that will shake the foundation of America's fabric and leave much for the audience to ponder.
0385504209|4.0|Dan Brown's &#34;The Da Vinci Code&#34; is one of those books that come along every once in a while and cause such a flap that even people like myself who wouldn't normally be interested in a book of its genre feel compelled to read it, if for no other reason than to hold an opinion on this cultural phenomenon. The story concerns a frantic race over the course of several days by one American symbologist, Robert Langdon, and a French cryptologist, Sophie Neveu, to unravel the motives behind the bizarre murder of the curator of the Louvre museum, a M. Jacques Saurniere, whose body has been found in a most unusual condition accompanied by a mysterious inscription. There is essentially no character development. Our detectives are drawn only superficially. Perhaps that's common in modern mystery novels. I wouldn't know. But &#34;The Da Vinci Code&#34; isn't a mystery in the conventional sense. It is more akin to a treasure hunt or jigsaw puzzle. The reader knows the identity of the murderer immediately. The mystery is the meaning of the encoded message found near the victim's body. &#34;The Da Vinci Code&#34; is a fast-paced, edge of your seat, quest to comprehend the seemingly interminable layers of a complex cipher.<br /><br />The meaning of the cipher is where the author Dan Brown treads on very controversial ground. &#34;The Da Vinci Code&#34; owes its intrigue to a provocative combination of religious history and pure fabrication. You may recognize the book's allusions to Gnostic Christian theology and the machinations of the nascent 4th century Roman Catholic Church as being largely accurate. But you may wonder how much of the further politico-religious mythology that our cipher reveals was simply concocted by the author. Dan Brown didn't make any of it up. But some others before him did. Yes, Gnosticism certainly views Mary Magdalene and the quality of Christ's divinity differently than Pauline Christianity. But all of the stuff about goddess worship and the French Merovignian dynasty being descended from Christ is a 20th century concoction. The Priory of Sion, which the author claims is and was a real organization, has actually been a lot of different organizations that have existed over the course of the past millennium. Its 20th century incarnations have no connection to the Medieval Catholic Order of Sion, which was absorbed by the Jesuit order in the 17th century, or to any other organizations that may have used these names in the interim timeframe. &#34;The Priory Documents&#34;, a product of the modern Priory of Sion, are the source for the mythology presented in &#34;The Da Vinci Code&#34;. And they are universally considered to be a hoax of entirely modern origins.<br /><br />&#34;The Da Vinci Code&#34; is often accused of being anti-Catholic. It asserts that the Emperor Constantine and the Council of Nicea, which was convened to establish Roman Catholic orthodoxy in 325 AD, picked and chose from among contemporary Christian theology those texts which served its own interests. No kidding. No history book on the subject says differently, so I'm not sure why the outcry. Perhaps it is the book's portrayal of the modern Catholic Church that has angered people. Truthfully, &#34;The Da Vinci Code&#34; is not so much critical of the Church as it is critical of fanaticism, both Catholic and anti-Catholic. The author is claiming that religious fanaticism, such as that espoused by Opus Dei, makes people susceptible to manipulation by those with unscrupulous agendas.<br /><br />I have to give Dan Brown credit for being able to create the constant sense of forward motion that makes &#34;The Da Vinci Code&#34; a real page-turner. On the other hand, there is very little actual mystery or story in the book, even less character development, and thoroughly mundane dialogue. The characters, like everything else, exist to showcase the bizarre and controversial  conglomeration of fact and fiction that have made this novel a bestseller.I have to admire a book that gets people to read other books, though. It has inspired me to learn more about the life, times and work of Leonardo Da Vinci. Maybe it will move other readers to investigate the reality of Opus Dei, the Order of Sion, the Knights Templar, Gnosticism, the origins of modern Christianity, and what little is known of alternative early Christian theologies. I hope so. &#34;The Da Vinci Code&#34;'s strengths are its edge-of-your-seat pace and its references, in amongst the fiction, to some history of modern thought that readers might not have considered before.

I hope so. &#34;The Da Vinci Code&#34;'s strengths are its edge-of-your-seat pace and its references, in amongst the fiction, to some history of modern thought that readers might not have considered before.

B0000C8Y0M|4.0|this album lives up to the hype. I think it really is great. The perfect follow up to the perfect band...THATS RIGHT. &quot;You Talk Way Too Much&quot; and &quot;The End Has No End&quot; make this album worth getting. It has been dismissed as a &quot;carbon copy&quot; of Is This It but that is a weak argument. This album is darker, few songs have the same unreserved singalong feeling as &quot;Last Nite&quot; and &quot;Someday&quot;. &quot;Reptilia&quot; and &quot;12:51&quot; are both hits without choruses, but somehow you dont notice. The guitar playing is great as can be expected from Valensi and Hammond Jr. This album is worth your time. The only reason I give it four stars is because there is no element of surprise with this album, whereas with Is This It I am still amazed with it. This album delivers in all the right places (catchy riffs, great vocals, an air of cool) and you would be foolish to not at least listen to it.
B00005AQF7|5.0|THIS IS STILL THE GREATEST SNOOP CD EVER MADE. IT SEEMS AS IF NO SNOOP DOGG CD THAT CAME AFTER THIS WAS EVEN ABLE TO COMPARE TO THIS ONE. THE BEST TRACKS ARE ''GIN &amp; JUICE'', SNOOP'S VERSION SLICK RICK'S ''LODI DODI'', ''MURDER WAS THE CASE'', ''SERIAL KILLA'', ''DOGGY DOGG WORLD'', AND ''PUMP PUMP''. TO NOT SAY THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST WEST COAST GANGSTA RAP CDS WOULD BE A DISRESPECT TO THE GENRE ITSELF. THIS IS UNDENIABLY A RAP CLASSIC. GET IT NOW IF YOU STILL DON'T GOT IT.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|As Secretary of Defense under both the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, Robert McNamara incurred the hatred of many Americans who opposed the United States' involvement in the Vietnam War. In &#34;The Fog of War&#34;, McNamara tells us what he  learned about the conflicts of nations from his experience in the Pacific during World War II, his narrow avoidance of nuclear annihilation during the Cuban Missile Crisis while serving the Kennedy Administration, and his reluctant complicity in the escalation of U.S. military involvement in Vietnam under the Johnson Administration. This man who has long been viewed as an unyielding, heartless, number-cruncher by anti-war activists gives candid first-hand accounts of the successes and failures of America at war, what happened, why it did, and who was responsible. McNamara is articulate, intelligent, and forthright in discussing his involvement in pivotal events in U.S. history, from World War II to 1967, when his inability to reconcile his view of the Vietnam conflict with President Johnson's -or Johnson's inability to reconcile with his- ended his service to the administration.<br /><br />Through director Errol Morris' interviews with McNamara and lots of archival film footage and audio tape, &#34;The Fog of War&#34; follows Robert McNamara's life from childhood, through his youth, service in WWII, his success at Ford Motor Company, his seven-year incumbency as Secretary of Defense, his thirteen-year career at the World Bank, to his return to Vietnam in 1995. Morris asks McNamara some questions, but for the most part McNamara leads the conversation where he will and is able to communicate his feelings at the time events were taking place and the conclusions he has drawn in hindsight, which he hopes will help younger generations avoid the sometimes disastrous consequences of war to which he was a party. The &#34;Eleven Lessons from the Life of Robert S. McNamara&#34; referred to in the film's title are not specifically the lessons which McNamara wished to impart. The Eleven Lessons are in part based on statements McNamara made and in part inferred by director Errol Morris. &#34;The Fog of War&#34; is a marvelous and important documentary. Robert McNamara's accounts and insights into so many of the Unite States' pivotal conflicts of the twentieth century are fascinating and invaluable.<br /><br />The DVD: As I mentioned, the Eleven Lessons in the film are not actually McNamara's lessons. &#34;Robert McNamara's Ten Lessons&#34; are available as a bonus feature introduced by McNamara. &#34;Additional Scenes&#34; includes 25 short scenes which didn't make the film's final cut, lasting 40 minutes total. These scenes include some interesting anecdotes and provide more insight into McNamara's personality, but they're not essential.which McNamara wished to impart.

B00003CXD5|5.0|The beauty of this classic film is that, while it certainly is a shattering depiction of how greed destroys a man and depletes one's innocence, THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE also works as an exciting adventure, with great-looking black-and-white scenery serving as perhaps a counterpoint to the darker things going on in the soul of Humphrey Bogart's Fred C. Dobbs. That a movie can be so entertaining yet so powerfully reflective of human nature is most likely what has allowed this film to live on ever since its release in 1948. Great entertainment that is also food for thought seems in such short supply in movies today that we really should treasure movies like this, especially when it's made this well.
0743454529|2.0|&quot;My Sister's Keeper&quot; is the first novel I have read by Jodi Picoult, and it could very well be the last.  The premise of the novel is so interesting: a younger sibling is genetically &quot;designed&quot; so that she will be an acceptable donor to her older sister, who is very ill.  As the girls age, there are medical, legal and emotional choices and consequences for the whole family.  The story is told from the perspective of each character in the story, which is also an interesting and insightful way to deal with the subject matter. <br />However, in spite of its promise in both subject matter and form, the novel does not deliver a pleasurable read or a satisfactory ending. At several points while I was reading, I thought: &quot;Is this a soap, or this literature?&quot; I felt like the book, which has lofty quotations which run the gamut from D.H. Lawrence to Shakespeare, has too many aspirations. The author does not let it be enough of a straight-up tug at your heartstrings family drama, and tries to endow it with more seriousness than the writing is really capable of pulling off. And the ending was just not appropriate: the reader is anticipating an ending that deals with the ethical consequences of the character's actions, and the author robs the reader of that experience.  I couldn't recommend the novel on that basis alone.
B000002GYR|5.0|Tom Waits is a brilliant singer/songwriter, and a true performer.  This artist has accomplished quite a bit in his long and interesting career.  However, his best work still remains his first effort.  CLOSING TIME is filled with classics that transport you to perhaps a different time, and a place where you are surrounded by ragamuffins dwelling on wrong turns that they made in life that have led them to where they are now.  The songs are stories, told by a master storyteller.  I recommend this album as an introduction to Tom Waits, as well as the &quot;Early Years&quot; CDs.  Enjoy!
0316666343|3.0|I am not a person who normally reads the raving bestsellers, mostly because I have been disappointed in the past when I do read them. &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; was described to be out of the ordinary and received such outlandish praise that I jumped aboard the fan wagon.<br />Alice Sebold is a &quot;lovely&quot; writer and worth reading, her subject matter is unfortunately real and she approaches &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; from an interesting point of view....that of a girl recently raped and murdered and telling her saga from heaven. Thankfully this novel is not another slapped together version of something that gets written about over and over again. This novel broke through! However I do feel it was rather tame and toned down to meet the masses as most &quot;bestsellers&quot; are. <br />&quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; is an easy read despite the horrible character delimma. It is gripping and well written but not unforgettable. I almost wish this novel had been allowed to stand on its own and not become an over-edited version of itself. But then maybe this subject matter needs to be presented to wider audiences and discussed in detail so that the impact of child kidnap and molestation becomes a &quot;bestseller&quot; as a cause.
B00003CXA2|5.0|If you're reading this, you probably already know the film, so there is no need to regurgitate the plot. You likely already know that you like the movie and are simply exploring the idea of buying it to own.<br />And if you haven't seen it yet, well, you probably WILL like the movie. Most people do, and for good reason. Forest Gump has a little something for everyone - love, humor, action, happiness, sadness, and everything in between. Despite interpretations to the contrary, it's not a movie pushing a message or driving an agenda; it's a charming fairy tale about a sympathetic character. Key words: &quot;fairy tale.&quot; Destined to be a classic for many years - unless you're prone to taking fairy tales too seriously.<br />For the price, this is a great package. This is a nice looking, crisp transfer of this modern classic that should look pretty good on high-end TVs. The cinematography deserves the widescreen treatment. The sound is superb. The second disc of extras is not all-encompassing, and the main documentary relies a bit too much on fluff rather than taking a hard look at the making of the film - I certainly would have liked extras with more substance - but it's an enjoyable watch nonetheless.<br />A good buy? Yes. For the price and the quality of the movie, this should be an easy decision to make.

B00003CX95|5.0|I watched Braveheart again over the weekend and this is truly an excellent epic drama.  But let's get one thing off the table first.  I do not view this movie as an accurate portrayal of William Wallace or Robert the Bruce - nor is it what the rating is based on.  Obviously plenty of liberties were taken with history.  The movie is great because it's a good story well told.<br />Braveheart is about the war for Scottish independence in the 13th century and the historical William Wallace who led the initial phases of the revolt.  Wallace is portrayed as a man of deep principle who wanted peace but wanted freedom for his countrymen more.  <br />The large battle scenes and the leadership of Wallace are awesomely portrayed, as is the untenable position of Robert the Bruce.  Bruce is caught between the Scottish nobles who prefer land, wealth, and favoritism from the British crown to freedom and safety for their Scottish brethren, and William Wallace, whom he could ally with to fight for freedom, but at the potential cost of his life, land, and status.    Robert the Bruce's internal struggle was well captured on screen.  <br />The only problem I had with the movie and story - but a minor one really - is the unlikely liaison between Wallace and the Princess of Wales.  Even in a fictional account of William Wallace, this seemed like a terribly unlikely event.  But in the scheme of things, this is a minor quibble.
B00009KMCB|5.0|Evenescence is great/ quit reading this reveiw and buy this CD
0792844882|4.0|This is one of those movies that people seem to either really love or hate.  I actually liked the movie for a variety of reasons.  <br />First, the plot is believable.  A down and out, although attractive woman dreams of being a Las Vegas showgirl.  She clearly has the looks and talent to be successful, just not the pedigree.  The movie is about what it takes for her to achieve her goal, in a somewhat seamy world where women and men are exploited by a cast of sleazy characters.  Secondly, Naomi, the main character played by Elizabeth Berkley, does have character.  She eventually has to decide if her dream is worth her compromising her values.  And despite being stripper and former call girl, she does have character.<br />I'm not sure why this film is so reviled by some.
0790731002|2.0|Batman Forever was, even at the time of its release, a sign of the begining of the end of the series.  Val Kilmer wasn't really all that bad as Bruce Wayne/Batman.  He looked the part of a playboy millionaire.  But Chris O'Donnell's Dick Grayson/Robin was a disaster.  He was too old for the part, too old to need a guardian.  The movie repeated what was now becoming stale.  The hero (Robin's) parents being killed by the villain (Two-Face)of the movie.  They had to trot out yet another blond heroine who discovers Batman's secret identity.  They couldn't be satisfied with just one villain, they needed two, like in Batman Returns.  Jim Carrey was suitably deranged for the part of the Riddler, but I wanted to yell yes when he asks at one point, \\"Was that over the top?\\"  He was undoubtedly the reason the movie was so popular, although the introduction of Robin could've been a factor.  The color scheme of the movie was a disco from hell look.  By the time the Riddler and Two-Face were destroying the Batcave, I felt like I was watching the old Adam West series.  What's happened to the Batman who's a detective and a master of disguises?
0385495323|4.0|I'd like to put this out there first.  If you dont like math and science, get a clue you wont like this book.  I however do enjoy math and science, especially computers.  This book captivated me from the beginning I very much enjoyed how the material was presented in the codemaking, codebreaking chronology.  There was however a section on language as code that I did not care for, but in all honesty Simon Singh writes at the beginning of the chapter that it is a bit of a detour and you do not have to read it.  It's a very good book if you would like get a general understanding about cryptography.  Or you just love interesting scientific fact and advances.
B00008H2LB|5.0|This is the best linkin park cd yet.  I liked their first cds with the rap type songs, but this cd blows all of the other songs away.  Every song on this cd is amazing.  The only song i hate is Session.  Its ok like when you listen to like the first 15 seconds of it.  But after that it gets boring witout words.  GO OUT AND BUY IT IF UR A SERIOUS LINKIN PARK FAN!!!!!!!
B00006RU5B|5.0|This is one of my favorite CDs that I've bought in a long while.  It is not to difficult musically, but flows well.  The lyrics have meaning and are somewhat moving.  Chris Cornell is quite a contributor and changed the RATM sound for the better.  I highly recommend this album if you like an easier going heavy rock album.
B00000DHRX|2.0|Sorry after the first 4 songs the album is a waste of money. All the rest are just boring copies of each other.
B00005NB8K|3.0|For a director who tries to show Jim Morrison as a poet who turned to philosophy and music to discover the truth about himself I have to say I am dissappointed because Oliver Stone created a drunk egoistic poser. Jim Morrison was the lizard king not a sex machine.
B0000C8AQM|4.0|Ok , i never bought the CD but i did'nt because alot of amazingly great music was missing form it ..   CAN SOME ONE  PLEASE TELL EM WHAT SONG JACK BLACK IS SINGING TO HIMSELF JUST BEFORE THE 2 GIRLS COME AND TELL HIM THEY HAVE A NAME FOR THE BAND ....   Someone said it's the theme from Computerman  .. and you can see it at Channel101 or something .. well i went there and it's not there anymore ...  i really really really want that song .. My Email is Sadcrew@sbcglobal.net <BR>Please email me if you know what the exact song name is and or know where i can gte it .. that song sounds awesome !!!!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I don't know what a lot of you are saying that it isn't as &quot;heavy&quot; as it was before, or that now it's &quot;radio friendly&quot;. What they had before was good, but this, its just &quot;wow&quot;. Just because every song isnt as heavy as you'd like it to be, that doesn't mean that the song is bad. Vermillion, a slower ballad, is an amazing song, no matter if its heavy or not (cause it doesn't matter!). Yes, Slipknot has changed, but changed into something better. Buy this cd. Most of you (hmm) won't be dissapointed.
B0001NBMBC|3.0|okay...considering that i don't even listen to nu-metal anymore, i've moved on to hardcore, initially i had no intention of buying this album. but, slipknot was my first metal band, my first rock albums were Slipknot and Iowa. so after mulling over it every store i went to for like a week, i bought this record. i'll say this, part of why i liked slipknot in the first place was they helped me find a voice and identify myself when i was coming of age and all that other good stuff...i felt like they had a message and eighteen middle fingers for society, so i, like almost everyone else, identified with this band three years ago. but that was three years ago. most people are saying this sounds like stonesour...not so. stonesour was more rock than this, which kind of reminds me of older Marilyn Manson material in a lot of ways, with the disharmonic, sort of rabid tune construction and the industrial effects on the guitars and the vocal overdubbing. i'll say this, they've edged closer in this direction with each recording, Iowa was halfway here and between Murderdolls and Stonesour the band is dead. it's a combination of the band's side projects and marilyn manson industrial antisocial but middle of the road garbage. the only song that i like on this record, and it's due only to some sort of half-assed nostalgia, is Pulse of The Maggots, which is something in between Marilyn Manson's Antichrist Superstar and Slipknot's Left Behind...and it's still not a great song. For all those who are thinking of picking this up because you were diehard Knot fans back in the day, spare yourselves the disappointment, the band we loved and grew up with is dead.
B000068PQ0|4.0|for when I originally listened to this album I was totally underwhelmed, and thought it was terribly mediocre.  I didn't listen to it for another year and a half, and I wasn't hesitant to even than.  But when I listened to it everything changed.  The album deserves the praise that is heaped upon it (unlike The Soft Bulletin).  Now let's get right down to it.  Wayne Coyne's singing is significantly downplayed in this album, it sounds great going with the trip hop beats and isn't cracking ever ten seconds.  The decision to make a more electronicish album this time around was definitely a good decision, and it breathes some fresh air into the Lips which the definitely needed after The Soft Bulletin.  As far as catchy pop songs, these are arguably the most finely crafted of the Flaming Lips career.  This time they really hit the mark.  The lyrics sure are both dumb and funny.  Wayne Coyne really has a knack for melody as shown on this album.  Fight Test and Do You Realize? are probably the most beautiful, production wise, songs that they have ever put out.  Both parts of Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots are grandiose pieces of pop and the latter is probably one of the better instrumentals that I've heard.  Like I said, Yoshimi is a great album and is almost deserving of five stars, but it kind of slags off at the end with All We Have Is Now and Approaching Pavonis Mons By Balloon are kind of unmemorable but the fare well enough.  But with songs like the ones previously mentioned and Are You A Hypnotist?? and Ego Tripping At The Gates Of Hell this is definitely worthy of a solid four stars.
B000002JOH|5.0|Pantera-Vulgar display of power is simply the best metal CD of the 90's. Nothing comes close to the raw energy that is Pantera. Bands have come and gone in the ninties, but Pantera gave us everything they had to offer, over and over.
B000002B1M|5.0|This is another classic album from nas, the whole album feels like it's telling a story, witness the tragic beauty of &quot;I gave you power&quot; where Nas forces the listner to think he is a gun and explain what he sees, This time around the music has a more wider appeal, it isnt quiet on par with illmatic, but still as good.<br />production: beats 9/10..........lyrics 10/10<BR>Favorite tracks: If I ruled the world ( imagine that ), I gave you power.
B0000C8AVX|5.0|One of Dylan's 3 best recordings from the 1960s and marked his complete break with the folk movement. Just a 5.

B0000B1OFL|4.0|A group of expert thieves led by mastermind Charlie Croker (Mark Wahlberg) and his father figure mentor, John Bridger (Donald Sutherland), successfully steals 35 million dollars worth of gold from a Venetian safe. But they are quickly double-crossed by one of their own partners in crime, who kills Bridger and forces the others to plummet into an icy river, leaving them for dead.  A year goes by and Croker contacts Stella (Charlize Theron), Bridger's daughter and a safe-cracking expert, and tells her that he has picked up the trail of the man who killed her father. He invites her to join his team and help reclaim their gold and avenge John Bridger's death.  Don't be discouraged from watching this movie by believing it to be a modernized remake of the 1969 classic. While there are definitely some connections between them (a plot-driving gold heist, car chases involving mini coopers and the movies' titles), this one is an excellently executed, Gary Gray film that shines on its own.  In a tight, solid plot it combines fast-paced action, thrilling suspense, clever and daring heists, great locales, state-of-the-art technology, engaging and witty characters, and a healthy dose of comedy skillfully added in all the right places. And the fact that it leaves out any unnecessary dramatic, life-altering issues makes it even more fun to watch.  The enjoyable mix of characters flawlessly portrayed by the actors, come alive through smart, snappy dialogues and believable characterizations. The choice of good, old-fashioned stunts that lend authenticity to the action over the not always effective CGI special effects, and the surprisingly pleasant musical score, give this movie the perfect finishing touch.  Sit back and enjoy the ride!  --Reviewed by M. E. Volmar
B0000C8AVM|5.0|Great great recording. I'd give it a 10 if possible. The best thing Dylan did in the 70s.
B000069AUI|4.0|This offering by Coldplay could very well be the soundtrack to your life.  It has that ubiquitous, be with you every where you go, qualities.  The songs will catch on with, maybe not with the first listen, maybe not the 5th, but by the 10th you'll be hooked.<br />At times the music gets a little too repetitious driving-droning, but Martin's pop-craftery elevates.  The music is polished.  It avoids extreme experimentalism of Radiohead.  Its more radio-friendly.  It avoids 5-stars by sticking with the safe sugared pop soundscape.  That's not to say Martin doesn't know his way around a song...he does.  Only too well sometimes I fear.<br />The more compelling tracks are dotted throughout, &quot;God Put a Smile Upon Your Face,&quot; will do just that.  It's difficult to drive down the road without this one being sung loudly.  It indeed places a smile just where it said it would.  &quot;The Scientist,&quot; has radio-hit balladry written all over it.  &quot;Clocks,&quot; is the hit without a weaker chorus holding it back from &quot;Yellow,&quot; heights.  Where the music gets elevated is a section in &quot;Daylight,&quot; where Chris Martin and crew dip to the depths with low repetition, &quot;Slowly breaking through the daylight, slowly breaking through the daylight,&quot; over and over again as the bass line hits catchy in the background and the orchestral music layers and soars.  It's a keeper.  A real musical moment.<br />Jump on the bandwagon.  There's good reason why everyone is crying the talents of Coldplay.  Don't expect edgy cutting stuff, just submit to the songs.  Keep listening, the new Brit alt pop will catch you, like a rush.<br />--MMW
B0000C8AVR|5.0|Great recording and one of Dylan's best. Revolutionary....broke things open for rock.
B000031XCR|4.0|&quot;All the Way: a Decade of Song&quot; was the last album Celine released before her two year break (Sony did release &quot;The Collector's Series&quot; in 2000). Unlike some reviewers have said, Celine is an artist who can actually sing! I have never heard anyone else who can sing with as much emotion and power like Celine does.<br />As for the album, it contains many of her biggest hits: &quot;The Power of Love&quot;, &quot;To Love You More&quot;, &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot;, &quot;It's All Coming Back to Me Now&quot; etc. It's only too bad, we were treated with only the not-so-great radio versions of some of these great songs. However, I do feel that a few of her other 'gems' such as &quot;Water From the Moon&quot; and &quot;All By Myself&quot; should have been put on here in place of some of the weaker newer tracks...hence the reason for the 4 star rating. The best new songs were tracks #10, 12, 14 and 15.<br />Like one other reviewer wrote, I am also sick and tired of people slamming singers, like Celine, who don't write their own songs. What I would like to know is if these same people slam the many songwriters out there who only write and don't sing. Unfortunately, not every singer was blessed with the ability to compose and write music and not every songwriter out there was blessed with a great singing voice. There are some so-called singers out there who shouldn't be writing their own music...such as Britney, Jessica Simpson and Avril Lavigne. <br />Celine may not write her own songs, but she certainly knows how to sing. She could teach the Christinas, Jessicas, and Britneys etc out there how it should be done.

He has the voice of an angel and the showmanship of all the greats put together.  I have to laugh at the reviews from Burnaby, they are both 1 star ratings, and are written by the same person...Some jealous old beau, or a guy that got his girlfriend stolen by the fab. Michael.  Don't bring out your personal problems on these sites, it is about the music, not  your jealousy.  We love everything that this artist gives us...they are such wonderful gifts.  Can't wait till the next c.d. with his originals..
B0001DI0FI|5.0|I don't know Russell Crowe personally, but I know his work, and I'm not sure the man would appear in a bad movie.  This one is a good one.<br />Peter Weir has collected all his available resources - a good story, CGI, other special effects, skilled cinematographers and set designers and a great cast and crew to put us to sea with a mighty hearty seagoin' adventure.<br />Crowe's \\"Lucky\\" Jack Aubrey is intelligent and seasoned, and clearly cares about his men individually as well as the ship and crew as a whole.  In his character we get to see the weight of momentous decisions he must make - sacrificing the life of an overboard sailor to save the entire ship, as well as bringing his overgunned and outmanned HMS Surprise right up to the speedy French Acheron and letting his crew have at it, knowing that many lives on both sides will be lost.<br />We get to see that the Captain is not always right, and he occasionally has to accept the consequences of his wrong actions or decisions.  But we also get to see that often effective leadership means taking decisive action and implementing an imperfect plan because a team that is committed to a wrong plan will accomplish more than a crew paralyzed because leadership has come up with no plan at all.<br />There is no love story artificially superimposed upon this rousing good tale, and the performances are fine and memorable.<br />I recommend this one highly for anyone looking for an intelligent action adventure.

I don't know how true this story is, or even how convincing he is as a woman, but thank goodness this movie was made.<br />I can't think of another movie more perfectly cast except.... maybe... Casablanca?  Jessica Lange is perfect as the beautiful soap actress and love interest.  Charles Durning is perfect as the sweet older man who falls in love with Dustin's &quot;Dorothy&quot;.  Terri Garr is perfect as the insecure female friend who loses the role on the soap to &quot;Dorothy&quot;.  Bill Murray is great in his few scenes - this is one of the first movies where we actually got to see him &quot;act&quot;.  Dabney Coleman is perfect as the arrogant director of the soap who cheats on poor Jessica.  Director Sydney Pollack wisely casts himself perfectly as Dustin's exasperated agent.  (The scene early on where he informs Dustin that NO ONE will hire him because he's too &quot;difficult&quot; is fantastic.) Lastly, Dustin Hoffman is perfect as the actor who becomes a better man by pretending to be a woman.<br />The film is full of situations that turn your expectations sideways - I'd give examples, but that would ruin your enjoyment if you haven't seen it yet!  Trust me - just watch this movie - but only if you want to be entertained!
B0000VAFO0|3.0|This movie had so much potential but I feel that it never came through.  I love the idea and the atmosphere it provides is excellent.  I can't honestly put my finger on it but this movie is missing something.  It's hard to find a really good horror/sci-fi movie these days.  I thought this one might be it but the story and the action just don't cut it.  Would I watch it again?  Of course I would! I just hope that the extended edition has something more to offer.
B00003CX8V|5.0|Mr. Lemmon figured prominently in a good dozen of the best films ever made, and he is at the absolute top of his game in &quot;The Apartment&quot; as C.C. Baxter - an up and coming business man who makes his way through the corporate ranks faster than usual by making his apartment available to higher executives to carry on affairs without paying for hotel rooms.  This is probably a borderline premise for a romantic comedy today, and it must have seemed absolutely scandalous 44 years ago, but the truth is that it is very contemporary in tone today while also being funny, thoughtful and poignant.  It's too bad there's noone as clever as Billy Wilder making Romantic Comedies today. Shirley Maclaine has never been better, and anyone who grew up watching Fred MacMurray in &quot;My Three Sons&quot; or any of those Disney films will be surprised to see him playing an absolute scumbag in this movie.  The dialogue is witty and sharp and the acting is crisper than a fresh celery stick.  This is a good time.
0440178002|5.0|The tale from the Far East. This book is second to none. it is the begining of Clavell's great series of books. The book set in the 1600s is about an English Captain named Balkthourne who was sailing on his ship until it was swept on to Japan. They are the first English but the Spanish already having arrived oppose the English there and have the japanese hold him and his crew in captivity. He uses ingenuity and intellect to get out of captivity to be involved in a historic point in Japan.<br />  I also recomend watching the mini series movie. It almost as good as the book. Then after read the rest of Clavell's books some tie in stuff from Shogun. Gaijin does an excellent job of that. ......WHAT ARE YOU DOING GO BUY THE BOOK AND READ IT!!
B0001ADAVK|3.0|I think that this movie wants to be a film about the empowerment of women, and there is nothing wrong with this.  The Julia Roberts character is likable and does a good job of depicting the now universally acknowledged notion in the civilized world that to be a complete woman does not have to attach herself to a man to attain self-worth.  (The ending of Under the Tuscan Sun cops out on this point.) The Julia Stiles character does a good job of depicting the viewpoint that the woman who COULD &quot;have it all&quot; isn't automatically wrong if she chooses to marry.<br />There were a few narrative threads that were lost, though.  The Julia Roberts character is offered a &quot;take it or leave it&quot; proposal by the school board about 15 or 20 minutes prior to the end of the film, and then there is no further discussion about it or even a scene where you get the idea that Ms. Watson is &quot;thinking about it&quot;.  There is, instead a final scene where you see what her decision is, but there is no notion of how the conflict was resolved, if only in her mind.  The situation was believable from a &quot;real life&quot; standpoint - I'm not privy to the private thoughts of people I meet in the world either - but the great enjoyment of literature and film is the ability to &quot;get inside the heads&quot; of the writers or characters, and in this case I was stuck outside Miss Watson's head wondering how she arrived at her choice and how she felt about it.
074325144X|5.0|I recently purchased the book &quot;Chi-Running&quot; while in Boston to run the marathon.  What a difference it has made in my world! Following Boston, I completed the 8 mile run of a team event in our area called &quot;Ski-to-Sea.&quot;  There are 8 member teams consisting of skiing (cross country &amp; downhill), running,canoeing, biking (road and mountain biking), and kayaking.  The run portion is an 8 mile run from the base ski area near the top of Mt. Baker, in Washington state, to the Dept of Transportation center, near the bottom.<BR>The entire 8 mile downhill course consists of a grade of about 3 - 5%.  I was envisioning total quad damage, shin splints, and other aches and pains. Fortunately, the night before I ran, I skipped ahead in the book and read the section about techiques for running down hill.  To make a long story short, I ran the 8 mile course in 56:07 (not bad for age 51)and have experienced little, if any, residual aches and pains.  These techniques really work! Chi Running is a highly effective program for running (not to mention a nice philosophy of life and living!).  Sincerely, Dr. Tim Wittman, School Psychologist, NCSP.
B00005JMFQ|3.0|Boy, I wanted to like this movie.  The professional reviewers had prepared me to think that this movie was at the head of it's class when it came to the theater.  Bill Nighy is rightfully praised for stealing the movie and with a cast that includes Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Colin Firth, Alan Rickman and Liam Neeson, what could go wrong?<br />For starters there was the \\"cute\\" idea that a couple who serve as body doubles in a porno movie would actually be shy and have difficulty communicating to each other that they really were attracted to one another in between the times that they were naked and bringing their private parts together.  When the first of these many scenes appeared on the screen a white-haired couple seated in front of the Mrs and myself walked out.  We were not offended enough to leave, but these scenes were unfortunately not particularly engaging or believable either.<br />Then there is the cute notion of the assistant to the Prime Minister of England who is commonly given to firing off language that my mother (and I bet your mother too) would call vulgar, he he, whenever the Prime Minister happens to be just coming in the door.  This is aside from the notion that her character is a full generation younger than he, yet they are *destined* to be together.<br />Has anyone else seen too many \\"Romantic Comedies\\" that end with one of the characters (usually the female) leaving (usually forever) their male love interest by heading towards an airport, only to have their true love come crashing towards that plane to catch them at the last second?  That cliche was ALREADY too old for me, and to see it trotted out again by having Liam Neeson's pre-pubescent son rushing through the airport after his pre-pubescent sweetie made me groan.<br />Bill Nighy runs away with his scenes, and the sub-plot with Colin Firth and the Italian house girl was fairly satisfying, though predictable.<br />In short - there are some eight or so stories going on here at once, and only about half are believable or interesting, while a few would shock your Mom so badly she'd faint.y about half are believable or interesting, while a few would shock your Mom so badly she'd faint.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|It's tough to argue that Fritz Lang's 1926 classic &quot;Metropolis&quot; is anything but a cinematic masterpiece. Lang, a master of what critics have since labeled German Expressionism, had an illustrious career in the movie making business in Germany as well as the United States. He came over here to escape the rise of the National Socialists in 1933. Once in Hollywood, he continued to make memorable films such as &quot;M,&quot; a movie about a killer based loosely on the monstrous German murderer Peter Kurten. Lang made films well into the 1960s, although none had quite the impact of this silent movie classic. For years, you couldn't see a decent version of &quot;Metropolis.&quot; The film is so old that it has fallen into the realm of public domain property, which virtually assured that every fast buck artist on the fringes of the movie business would release a smudgy, hacked up version of the movie. Thanks to the Murnau Foundation, a film restoration project devoted to restoring early twentieth century films, we can now see &quot;Metropolis&quot; in a form closer to the original. It's not perfect, not by a long shot, since a significant portion of the movie has disappeared, but what we do get looks fantastic. I watched a restored version of &quot;Nosferatu&quot; recently and it couldn't compare to how &quot;Metropolis&quot; looked.<br />&quot;Metropolis&quot; takes place in a bleak futuristic city of rigidly defined social classes. The haves, presided over by powerful industrialist Freder Fredersen and his son Joh, live in the highest buildings from which they run the bustling city. Unfortunate souls, which include just about everyone else, live underground in huge apartment type dwellings. This keeps the workers close to the huge machinery that runs the city's various industries and buildings. It also keeps the proletariats confined in easily controlled and policed areas. Life basically stinks for the workers in Metropolis, where their existence consists of endless and dreary work shifts with little time left over for amusement. Moreover, the work is extremely dangerous and demanding. It isn't unusual at all to see the machines chewing up laborers whose attention strays from their tasks for a few seconds. If this description makes you think of Marx, communism, socialism, or class struggle, you're on the right track. The movie was made during a time when these issues dominated the thoughts of millions of people around the world. &quot;Metropolis&quot; is the sort of movie Upton Sinclair or Jack London might have made had they been filmmakers instead of writers.<br />The social situation in Metropolis is about to change. As Joh Frederson basks in the luxurious surroundings of a massive club built for the city's affluent youngsters, he catches sight of a beautiful prole named Maria who accidentally leads a group of workers' children up to the top of the building. She quickly apologizes for straying from her assigned areas, and in the process calls Joh &quot;brother.&quot; Intrigued, the rich youth begins to search for this lovely vision despite the strict oversight of his demanding father. Joh wanders into the byzantine depths of the city, switching his identity with a worker and even toiling away at a wearisome task. Meanwhile, up in the Fredersen control center, Joh's father meets with a scientist named Rotwang to discuss the turmoil going on down in the worker areas. This technician is responsible for most of the mechanical innovations of the city, and he's planning a special treat for the clueless workers. The leader of a movement to destroy the plutocracy just happens to be the beautiful young girl Joh is seeking out; so the crazed scientist builds a robot that looks just like her. He programs this machine to mislead the dissident workers, thus insuring the plutocrats will continue to rule. Things don't quite work out the way the oligarchy plans, however, when Joh uncovers the plot and attempts to bring the two groupsof humans together.<br />There's more to the story than this description. A subplot about Joh's deceased mother factors into the activities of the scientist and his father, for example, but the theme of class warfare dominates every frame of the movie. You'll probably spend more time staring in wonder at the world Lang and his compatriots constructed than you will analyzing a plot that has the subtlety of a sledgehammer to the stomach. The city is an amazing triumph of model mock-ups and painted backgrounds. Planes soar between skyscrapers, cars and trains whiz along suspended tracks, and lights and giant neon screens twinkle and flash. Forget CGI effects; while this movie was made eighty plus years ago, the special effects work is so spectacular that you'll hardly believe they could convincingly pull this off. The great effects extend to the machines and underground scenes, especially in a scene where a huge piece of equipment turns into &quot;Moloch,&quot; a living, breathing beast capable of swallowing up whole ranks of hapless workers. &quot;Metropolis&quot; served as an early example, if not the only earliest example, of what cinema could really do. I see it as a precursor to the effects laden films of today. That it took sixty to seventy years to match the intensity of this work speaks well of Lang's visionary prowess as a filmmaker.<br />The DVD contains a plethora of exciting extras. You get a detailed biography of Lang's career, the obligatory commentary track by a film historian, stills, a facts and date feature, a short documentary outlining Lang's career, the film's history, and German Expressionism called &quot;The Metropolis Case,&quot; and a restoration featurette. The documentary is quite intriguing, showing how Lang and his crew constructed the special effects for the film. I usually avoid most DVD extras, but I made an exception in the case of &quot;Metropolis.&quot; All fans of science fiction and effects heavy films owe a huge debt of gratitude to Fritz Lang. Watch &quot;Metropolis&quot; as soon as you can.of humans together.<br />There's more to the story than this description.

B00003CXXP|5.0|Finally got around seeing this science fiction film that posits a world of man...and machine.<br />Although the film goes on longer than it had to, this Spielberg/Kubrick effort is simply wonderous in its tale of how an uneasy humanity confronts ever-increasingly human-like robots.  Throughout the film one can sense the approach-avoidance emotions that the actors have with the machines that take over more and more of our lives.  The machines clean our houses, make our products, and even satisfy our more elementary needs.  And, perhaps, they begin to do all of this too well.  Could it be that humans have manufactured their own replacements?  And that unease only deepens when mechanical children enter the picture.  Can one love a robot?  Can one love back?<br />The plot has been relayed in depth here, so I won't repeat it, but suffice it to say that the plot is solid, makes sense in the confines of the film, and doesn't strike too many false notes.  I did think the film was going to end several times before it finally did. <br />This is a good film to buy, because one's appreciation of the film will only deepen upon repeated viewings.<br />And I can't say enough about the special effects, nor Jude Law's performance.  It's frightening and heart-warming at the same time. And Haley Joel Osment is as good here as in 'The Sixth Sense'; the perfectly lovable, er, robot. <br />Highly recommended.
B00005ATQ9|4.0|_Barry Lyndon_ is absolutely stunning to watch.  Kubrick's masterful hand at orchestrating sweeping views of naturally lit countryside transports the audience into the 18th century and alongside our characters.  Some complain that Kubrick, while commanding the visual aspects of the film, allows the acting to fall by the wayside.  Ryan O'Neill does not do an adequate job as Lyndon, it is claimed, failing to capture the character's motivation and nature.  I disagree most strongly on this point.  Kubrick and O'Neill have managed to capture a human being, one who defies the trend of most Hollywood films and popular fiction.  Lyndon is not the loveable character-his rise to power is not paved with nobility and honor, nor is his downfall laced with a deep sense of tragedy.  Yet, I still feel for Lyndon's character in the declining stages of his life.  Just as he is not completely approachable, he is not repulsive either.  By allowing this level of subtlety to emerge from the character, Kubrick and O'Neill have managed to create a tragedy more along the lines of Shakespeare's _Coriolanus_ than some sentimental special on the Hallmark channel.<br />_Barry Lyndon_ clocks in at just over three hours, breaking once in the middle for an intermission.  For its visual appeal, it is worthy every penny, though it may leave some members of the audience wishing for quicker pacing and a plotline that is easier to digest.  If you have the time and are a fan of Kubrick's masterpieces, I could not recommend this film more highly-just make some popcorn during the intermission and stretch your legs.
B00018D44U|5.0|I love this cd. Songs like TOES and SUNRISE have a pleasing, easy summer sound.  CREEPIN' IN features Dolly Parton whose voice blends nicely with Jones's.  I love the percussion and bass throughout but especially on LONG WAY HOME.  And I can't get HUMBLE ME out of my head.  On warm days I just find myself wanting to listen to this CD  -- it seems like the perfect soundtrack for a summer day.  I highly recommend it, it is a great sophomore cd though it has a very different sound and sensibility from COME AWAY WITH ME.
0802130208|4.0|Ignatius J Reilly is fat. Ignatius is lazy. He is slothful, arrogant, condescending, self-obsessed, self-absorbed, incapable of empathy, calculating, ignorant, deluded and did I mention obese? After all but causing a car accident thanks to his tendency to 'aid' people with their driving, his mother demands that the unemployed, thirty-year old get a job. He is horrified, certain that gainful employment will disrupt the sporadic work he does on his masterpiece. And of course there is the problem with his valve.<br />So he finds himself a job. He breezes into the Levy Pants company and demands more pay, later starting time, and then spends his days carefully painting a cross to cheer everyone up. Then he incites a riot. Then he gets fired.<br />This first job sets a lot of events in motion. Characters are introduced and frequently we enter their lives to see what is happening. This has the effect of diluting Ignatius' presence from the story - but only slightly - however the compromise here is that we know it will all tie in together - we just don't know how.<br />There is Jones, the black floor-sweeper at the Night of Joy, quite possibly the worst strip-club in all of New Orleans. Mr Levy, the disillusioned son of the original - and best, if we can believe his wife - Mr Levy. George, the mysterious package deliverer. Mancuso, the down on his luck detective, and more. Excluding Jones, these characters all have sub-par development as character, and serve mostly as caricatures. This goes even more so for the lesser characters I have not mentioned.<br />Events do tie themselves up a little too neatly. There is a sense that every little action, no matter how inconsequential, builds towards a whole, which doesn't really reflect the reality of life, but this is a moot point. Ignatius is an amazing character, so awful, arrogant and just plain mean to every other person imaginable that you will have to fall in love. Who cannot enjoy his Working Boy Journals? Or his love/hate relationship with Myrna? Don't necessarily read this book for plot - which, though strong, plays out like a 1 hour crime special - read it for Ignatius.
0316666343|5.0|How do I explain this novel? Maybe as a heartbreakingly vivid portrayal of life for the remaining members of a family who's daughter was killed - as told by the dead daughter.  A 14 year old girl is killed on her way home from school.  How does life go on for her mother, father and sister is the premise of this highly original novel.  I can't go any further without giving too much away so I'll just say - a must read!
B00003CY0V|5.0|this movie is a really good movie one of my favorites....because it (...)is real realistic and stuff. i suggest seing this movie and buying it

A young girl makes a decision in a moment of selfishness - but hey, what adolescent hasn't? - and this small unretrievable act has momumental affects.  No matter what she tries to do - for the rest of her life - she can never undo her wrong.  Makes you stop and think.  Atonement is beautiful and emotionally haunting novel.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|As a pretty big Slipknot fan I should technically write a long ass review like some of the other nerds on here have but the fact is Volume 3 can speak for itself it some ignorant pricks would actually listen to the album!<br />I think someone said it best when they said this album was both ugly and beatiful! For that comparison look now further than Vermillion, which is by no means heavy but is a great metal track, then they took a step further and did an acoustic cover of their own song at the end of the album and by gosh it's freaking awesome!<br />I must admit, readin what other people have posted about the album I was expecting to be dissapointed by I wasn't. <br />And why is the title to this review FINALLY? Well after two mainstream releases Slipknot have finally changed the same drum beat they used in Iowa and Slipknot. The guys can play their instruments a hell of a lot better and Corey is on of the best screamers/melodic singers out there....<br />Slipknot are better than ever!
B00005JKJA|4.0|Keeping in mind that we're talking about David Lynch here, this film was avant garde without being too out there - at least in relation to his other works (Blue Velvet comes to mind....)  I don't know how to praise this film without giving too much away so I'll just say the whole &quot;reality&quot; issue was interesting and well done.  All in all, a dark movie that stands up to repeated viewings.  This movie takes the viewer on one heck of a wild ride and keeps your attention glued to the screen until the rolling credits - can't ask for better than that.
B000002TQB|2.0|There's good songwriting and a lot of talent here, but I guess it's just not my cup of tea.  Somehow, it just doesn't work, and isn't a pleasant listening experience for me at all.  Radiohead is one of my all time favorites, and this just doesn't compare.  I'm not saying everything has to sound like Radiohead (thank heavens it doesn't), but like RH I'll give this album several listens to see if my opinion of it doesn't change.  Right now, to my unaccustomed ears, it sounds like Clash meets Duran Duran with some late Beatles thrown in.  Maybe a bit too much \\"British pride\\" for me.  If you like that kind of thing, then by all means get this album.  I will end by saying it's better than 90% of the music being made today,, having good composition, arrangement, and songwriting.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|Iam in a rush, Ive just seen the first disc (the complete concert) and Iam still amazed at how good this one is, the level of emotion and quelity just rise and rise nonstop, its climax? the very end, I felt I had to write about it right now, it might sound stupid but....I cry every 10 years or so, but the final song brought a small tear to my eye, IT IS moving, in a good way though.<BR>The songs are beautifully performed, the guests are excellent (although I did miss bob dylan), these days is too hard to find tribute concerts so classy as this one. <BR>I dont know if you will find this review useful or not, I just had to write about it. Hey, now I have to watch the second disc.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|Avril's first album was horrible enough. Poppy ballads claiming to be coming from a &quot;hardcore punk rocker&quot; (and by the way,did  I never saw Joey Ramone, Kurt Cobain, or Matt Skiba on the cover of Teen People?...No.) These lyrics or tunes are no less pop than Brittney or Christina. In fact I think i can handle those two better than Avril. At least they are not pretending to be &quot;Hard Rockers&quot;. But ,anyway, for the review part...it's a horrible Cd filled with pop ballads written by a bunch of 40 year old fat man, it's Avril's voice put through a bunch of machines to make it sound better, and has her face on the cover. All you need to know. Go find someone better. WAIT, THERE IS NO GOOD MUSIC TODAY! I guess you guys are screwed.
0553381407|5.0|Leanna Jackson, going to be a survivor,<BR>This is an excellent book and speaks as though it is talking about my own past.

Lost Boy-Because I understood what he went through
B0001NBMBC|3.0|What happened?  With the exception of a couple of songs I thought I had purchased a Stone Sour cd.  I don't find anything wrong with Stone Sour.  I think Corey has is a man of many talents, but when I buy a Slipknot cd I want it to be Slipknot dammit.  I knew right away when I went to grab this album off of the shelf, and I saw that there was no Explicit Lyrics label on it, I knew the band had changed.  The band that is supposed to say what they feel has given in to the censors.  As a drummer myself I look up to Joey.  Although his drumming is intense in this album, nothing could match up to his work in the first two.  I gotta say though, I do like the field drum work in track 2.  This album had some similarities and differences in comparison with the first two.  As far as I'm concerned, the real Slipknot has been slayed by a radio friendly Stoneknot.
0446677450|1.0|This is simply a bad book. It contains almost nothing but the author's tall tales, and very little concrete information or advice. What little advice is offered tends to be bad!<br />There are far better financial advice books out there. Try &quot;Get a Financial Life&quot;, by Beth Kobliner, for some sound (if unglamorous)advice, for example.
B0001CCXGG|5.0|I am re-reading some of the reviews here and want to make certain that folks interested in this CD are not deterred by some of the pedantic postings about Yngwie.  Buy some of his music and then comment - aside from the poor lyrics the guitar (and often keyboards) is a blast.  If you are basing your critique on this performance alone it is not fair though I am curious how you can (as a guitarist) watch and think Yngwie is sub-par (where he is in fact by far the most fun to watch).
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie, because of the fact that it is so different from most other movies out there right now.  It feels like they took a &quot;day in the life&quot; approach, which contributes to the unstructured feel of the story.  It feels like an honest portrayal of unrequited love, something that is very ordinary and not dramatic or schmaltzy.  It was refreshing to see that loose ends were not tied up in a pretty bow at the end, much like life.  Oddly enough, you would think that a movie without car chases, explosions, or horrifying revelations would be boring as hell.  Not so - I didn't once look at the clock thinking, &quot;Are they done yet?&quot;, as I have with numerous releases in the past couple of years.<br />The DVD has a good amount of extras, considering the type of movie.  The extra scenes were good, but would have screwed with the pacing of the final product.  And the behind the scenes featurette was entertaining.  All in all, a very worthwhile purchase.
B000002L0A|5.0|The first Slayer album I ever heard was &quot;South of Heaven,&quot; and I was hooked. I could not stop listening to it. I had never heard that much anger mixed with passion and talent before. My parents also hated the title... that's probably why I bought it in the first place.<br />I love &quot;Reign In Blood.&quot; It is, by far, the best example of true thrash metal ever... 10 songs in 29 minutes... and still beats the hell out of ANYTHING coming out now.<br />That said... THIS is my favorite Slayer album ever. Why? It combines the speed of &quot;Reign In Blood&quot; with the mid-tempo ultra heavy grooves of &quot;South of Heaven.&quot; It's also the most musical of all the Slayer albums, if that means anything.<br />From the opening speed riffing of &quot;War Ensemble&quot; to the churning of the title track, this is the total package for Slayer. Lombardo proves himself as the fastest drummer around. King and Hannaman never sounded better, and Tom's voice really shines... not quite sure if that's a compliment, though.<br />FYI... it was Metal Hammer's album of the year, 1990.<br />BUY IT!!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Screw all you guys who thinks this cd was bad you obviously know nothing about music. people change all bands change over the years. look at metallica ok bad example they suck now. but the point is all bands change and mature and i think this album is just as metal as the rest. so my opinion is if you are thinking about buying this album do it its worth your money.
B0001CCXY8|5.0|This has to be one of Cannibal Corpse's greatest releases. It could have been the greatest but..... Corpsegrinder doesn't do much with the vocals here, the drumming is just repetitive and...the drumming sux. Since when do drummers find it ok to play the same song over and over again for 15 years. Ever wondered why CC has been (and sometimes still is) monotonous? The drumming could do alot to fix this. Paul Mazurkiewicz has got some talent and could have made CC even better and maybe even elevated them to the levels of Vital Remains, Cryptopsy, Death...you know the sort. The drumming is just plain boring and it has been for the last.....i thought the drumming was good on Eaten back to life....I kinda lost my trail of thought...but the drumming has been the same for years. Anyway, my gripe about Corpsegrinder is that he doesn't really go anywhere with the vocals. Yeah, his delivery is extremely fluid and fast with absolute precision and he releases some of the longest screams I've ever heard him do, but the vocals don't stand out from track to track (except for Severed Head Stoning) like they did on songs like Sentenced to Burn and Stripped, Raped, Strangled. George Fisher could have easily raised the standards a notch if he had've put some thought into things for this cd.<br /> Jim and Pat are absolute maniacs on the guitars, everything has pace changes everywhere, little starts and stops, the solos are good and the riffs are super. Not to mention that this is by far the heaviest CC record ever. Pat, Jim and Alex are each a technical genius in their own right.<BR>Alex isn't heard for most of this album and thats a majorly(?) bad thing as he is one of my favourite bassists, my 3 favs. being Steve Harris (Iron Maiden), Alex Webster (from here, CC) and Eric (Cryptopsy. Again I would like to mention that this album is heavy as hell! The production here is excellent, other than my complaint about not hearing Alex properly, everything is clear, set at the right volume andall the brutality and super heaviness are captured the way they are meant to be heard.<br />As for the songs, they are all good, very solid cd, quite enjoyable once you get used to it. Very heavy and fast. Severed Head Stoning, Phsycotic Precision, The Wretched Spawn, Cyanide Assasin and Festering in the Crypt are just a few of this album's highlights. Over the drumming and the vocals, I hope I haven't made this sound like a bad cd, cuz it kicks major @ss. Give it a go if you're a Corpse fan, if not, start somewhere else like The Bleeding.
0767827716|5.0|Director:  John Carpenter<BR>Cast:  Keith Gordon, John Stockwell, Alexandra Paul, Robert Prosky, Harry Dean Stanton.<BR>Running Time:  110 minutes.<BR>Rated R for violence and language; not nearly as graphic as it could be--a Carpenter trait.<br />Based on Stephen King's highly popular bestselling novel, \\"Christine\\" is perhaps director John Carpenter's second best film (behind \\"Halloween\\", obviously) and a sure-fire treat for all those who enjoy King adaptations, Carpenter created films, or just good ol' fashioned suspense.  The film centers around a demonically possessed 1958 Plymouth Fury with a strange history--the workers who completed the construction of the car were mysteriously killed and the initial owner of the vehicle took his own life after his wife suddenly died.<br />Keith Gordon stars as Archie Cunningham, a classic geek in high school who wears nerdy frames and eats packed yogurt for lunch.  He is the butt of many jokes, but jock star Ryan Stockwell is still his best buddy.  After school one day, Archie comes across Christine, the devilish car.  He fixes her up and proceeds to become obsessed by her.  A new-found confidence prompts Arnie to ask the cutest girl in the school (Alexandra Paul) out for a date and they quickly fall in love--but Christine does not approve.  The car demands Arnie's complete and unquestioned devotion and when outsiders seek to interfere, they become the victim's of Christine's horrifying wrath.<br />A superb performance from Gordon in the lead role, transforming himself from a laughing stock class dork to an arrogant, obscene maniac who gets so comsumed with Christine that will be anything to preserve the safety of the car.  Excellent script from Bill Phillips, unraveling the King masterpiece with a quick deliberance that keeps the audience on the edge of their toes and waiting for Christine's next move.  Outstanding direction and musical score creation by Carpenter, using specific lighting arrangements and camera angles to add to the suspense, all the while producing a terrifying musical accompanyment.  Even though it is not overly terryfying with sudden jolts of scares, \\"Christine\\" is horror/suspense at its very best and a hidden gem of the thriller genre.  One of the best, most unheralded horror films of the early part of the decade.
B00005JLKB|3.0|As this is the first season of Smallville, it was a little duller than the subsequent seasons. While relationships were being formed and characters being explored, the show tended to become a villain of the week fest. Each week, some villain poewred by kryptonite meteor rocks tended to appear, kill people, and get defeated by the awesome Clark Kent. It got a little boring after a while, but towards the end of the season, the show became veteran enough to do more character involved plots. The first season is a little slower than the awesome seasons afterwards, but its good enough to merit the purchase.
0790734850|5.0|Director:  Curtis Hanson<BR>Cast:  Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, James Cromwell, David Strathairn, Kim Basinger, Danny DeVito.<BR>Running Time:  156 minutes.<BR>Rated R for violence, language, and some sexuality.<br />A toast and dedication to the fine film noir classics that evolved in the 1940's and 1950's, \\"L.A. Confidential\\" is a cop story told the way it should be--intellectually, right in your face, and with a spice of humor.  Based on the bestselling novel by James Ellroy, this crime caper is a masterpiece of suspense, sensuality, and straight-up heroism.<br />After a holiday mishap at the police station in which several officers brutally beat up inmates and a killer maniacally shoots and kills numerous victims at a local bar, detectives Kevin Spacey and Russell Crowe search for answers.  Spacey is a high-profile cop who benefits from raunchy tablod writer Danny Devito's busts of movie stars and political figures, while Crowe is wonderul as the straight-laced detective who finds his life in shambles of corruption as he gets closer and closer to the truth, and also as he gets more involved with one of an enigmatic millionare's erotic hookers (Kim Basinger in a knock-out role).  Guy Pearce plays the up-and-coming son of a police station legend who will do whatever it takes to get a promotion, including selling out his colleagues and stealing their girls.<br />Excellent adaptation of the wonderful novel, using the cast to create a rigorous, enveloping story that will keep audience's guessing until the very last second.  Bold, telling performances from the entire cast, especially Crowe (which should have been at least Oscar-nomination worthy) and Pearce (who steals the show from Crowe time to time).  Action-packed, character driven, and as smart of a crime drama as you will ever find.  Certainly one of the best, if not THE best of its kind made in the 1990's.  Was very unfortunate to be overshadowed by the juggernaut \\"Titanic\\"; could very well of won Best Picture.  The DVD has some special behind the scenes documentaries--check out \\"Off the Record\\"--which contains interviews from the film's creators, lead actors and novelist James Ellroy.

John meets up with a woman also targeted for assasination, and is once again saved by the Terminator.

0790731894|4.0|Director:  Stuart Baird<BR>Cast:  Kurt Russell, Steven Seagal, Halle Berry, John Leguizamo, Oliver Platt, Joe Morton, David Suchet, Len Cariou, B.D. Wong, Marla Maples Trump.<BR>Running Time:  135 minutes.<BR>Rated R for violence and language.<br />Although it is a formula that has been used time and time again, \\"Excecutive Decision\\" succeeds just as well, if not better, than the \\"hostage-takes-over-plane-so-action-hero-has-to-come-to-rescue\\" genre predecessors because of wonderful performances, an in-depth and enjoyable script, and top-tier direction from rookie Baird.  Very simliar to 1992's \\"Passenger 57\\" staring Wesley Snipes, but with more emphasis on the supporting cast instead of one central star.<br />Kurt Russell stars as a United States government expert on Middle East terrorism who finds himself out of his office and on a die-or-die mission with gung ho commando Steven Seagal and Co. when an American airliner is taken hostage while in midair.  Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on how you look at it), Seagal is killed about a half an hour into the film, allowing Russell to take full command of the film.  With the help from gorgeous flight attendant Halle Berry, Russell is able to learn about the situation and guide his great supporting players John Leguizamo, Oliver Platt, and Joe Morton as to how they need to approach the dangerous situation.<br />If there is one major drawback of the film, it is that \\"Executive Decision\\" is fairly fairfetched and predictable at the same time--the anti-terrorist crew actually gets onto the plane while it is in the air and without the terrorists knowing--come on!  But despite some of its logical fallouts, it is a film that makes up for it with a superb lead role, fine performances from Platt as a brainiac and Leguizamo as a rough-and-tough go-getter, and a gut-wrenching, thrill-ride (literally) of a finale.  A nice directorial debut.  One of the better action films of the mid 1990's and is on par with other plane thrillers such as \\"Con Air\\".
B00005JMEW|5.0|I loved Kill Bill Volume 1. Sure, it's a gory movie, with lots of violence. But hte gore is very cartoony, as is the violence. Also, the storyline is very interesting, and the fights are excellently choreographed. This movie is only for the action fans though, as the gore can be a turn off. However, it was an excellent film as far as Tarantino films go. Starring Uma Thurman, Lucy Lui, Vivica Fox, Daryl Hannah, David Caradine, and Michael Madsen.
B00004TDTO|5.0|When I first saw the movie \\"Jaws\\" when I was 6 years old, I thought it was just another same old story that my father likes to watch. After I watched it, I was overcomed by fear of the sea. To this day, I still don't want to swim in the sea! This same effect has occured in the world in the mid 70's for six straight years immediately when \\"Jaws\\" started showing in theatres. The story is written by a brilliant author, masterful performances by Roy Schieder, Robert Shaw & Richard Dreyfuss, and a realistic and voracious Great White Shark. Now, I'm 12 and to this day Jaws remains in my top spot for horror movies. For all horror and shark fans alike, this one is for you. It will remain a classic and will still be able to make entire generations be afraid to go into the water.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|Picking up immediately after the cliff-hanger ending of Reloaded, Revolutions is a perfect ending to the trilogy. Albeit a little predictable, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Zion rallies to battle against the impending onslaught, Neo and Trinity make their way to the machine city to fight off Agent Smith, and Niobe and Morpheus make their way toward Zion with the last remaining EMP. The forces allign themselves in the cataclysmic showdown which will decide the fate of humans and machines alike. The third installment is better than both the previous two, and this is a must have. Starring Keanu Reeves, Laurene Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, and Jada Pinkett Smith.
630027120X|5.0|The story takes place in 1750 as the jesuits teach the Native Indians of Southern America different things to help them live off their own work, among other things. The movie reveals the cruelty with which the indigenous people were treated, but also shows how humane and capable they were of stablishing their own communities. It is a story that gets to your heart no matter how strong you are. You feel for the characters and you hate others as well. You see the frustration and the tragic destiny of the native people in a way that no other movie has done before. Culturaly wise, it opens your mind and your heart to other societies. Besides being a heart-touching story, the movie is a great historical reproduction. Without doubt, it is one of the best movies I have seen. It says a lot about humanity and it makes you question your role as an individual.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Here in the Netherlands we're almost through with this great series. At first when I heard about the story I thought I really wouldn't like it. Cowboys in space, huh!? But, 'cause I'm a big Buffy and Angel fan, I decided to watch anyway. We didn't start with the pilot, onfortunately, but with the Trainjob. An episode which I, looking back, didn't like so much. And also the characters, they had to 'grow' on me, if you know what I mean. But after a watching a few more, I became totally hooked. So I ordered the dvd. Because this is a show you want to watch again. And again. And ... again! There is so much to discover, in dialogues, details, background etc. I also like the extra's that are on the fourth disk a lot, especially: Here's how it was, the Making of...<BR>Please buy these dvd, you won't be sorry, worth every cent! This is the first review I ever wrote, I'm afraid it's not a very good (or objective!!!) one, but I just had to do it.<BR>(And yes, they are shooting the movie right now! I'm so excited about the movie, 'just' a year of waiting ... and watching my dvd-set again and so on.)<BR>Also very funny ... all the fansites, very very nice to know I'm not the only obsessed person in the 'verse!
B00005JMEW|3.0|I, personally, very much enjoyed this movie. However, there were times where I wondered whether I was watching a movie, or simply watching violence erupt on screen. This movie was definately filled with action, high paced, as well as slower paced suspence. The unfortunate thing is that is seems that for all the action, there is very little of the story. <br />Overall, it was a high-quality movie, but if you're looking for something with a good, strong storyline, you may want to look elsewhere.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly was a great show. Period.<BR>I greatly dislike westerns, only general indifference for most science fiction, and I cannot stand Joss Wedon's previous works(Buffy anyone?), however Firefly was able to combine the two into a fun,action-packed, creative, character-driven MASTERPIECE. I love all 13 episodes and I find it tragic that I only caught four of them on TV before the show was unceremoniously cancelled. Pick up this boxed set even if you don't like the premise or genre, etc and watch the first few episodes, you will love it. <br />With more than 200,000 copies of the boxed set sold to date, they have decided to resurrect Firefly as a feature-length movie called Serenity to start filming in June 2004. MAKE SURE TO SEE IT in Theaters in the hopes it gets a sequel.

His voice awakens my entire being and it was as if my soul said: \\"Yes, this is the music you have been looking for.\\"<br /><br />The first song threw me into a world of absolute musical ecstasy. I could not believe what I was hearing, nor could I believe how profoundly this music would affect me. One minute I was swirling in some dreamy exotic world where I felt complete love and happiness. Then, next I was crying because this music has an energy that permeates every part of your being. It takes you to new emotional depths and creates waves of emotions unlike anything I've ever heard.<br /><br />Not only are some of the lyrics an expression of beautiful vulnerability when in love (In Confession), some of the lyrics will even make you cry when you don't even know their meaning. I was amazed that I was crying when I could not understand the lyrics in Mi Mancherai (il postino). The violin is literally weeping in music. I think this music is more profound if you have always wished for your true love/soul mate to sing directly to you. It feels like every song was written for the listener and you can't help but get caught up in the full-range of emotions. Josh Groban captures all the emotions of the words and once I looked up a translation I understood why the song was so beautiful. Unfortunately the song translations are not included.<br /><br />I'll miss you, if you go away<br />I'll miss your serenity<br />Your words like songs in the wind<br />And Love, that you take away.<br />~Mi Mancherai<br /><br />\\"When You Say You Love Me\\" is one of the most exquisite songs I've ever heard. I mean, this song could make you literally breathless. Remember When It Rained has an almost ecstatic soul-shivering ending. The music is as powerful as a storm and the ending is as cleansing and healing as the freshness of the air after a thunderstorm. The passionate lyrics are a bit like lightning that really capture your attention.<br /><br />Josh really pours an entire range of emotions into every selection, especially in Never Let Go. The power of the music and his voice is almost too much for my headphones.<br /><br />CLOSER is filled with classic bittersweet moments, melting and exquisite declarations of eternal love, heart-stopping lyrics and imaginative metaphors. All the elements intertwine to make this one of the most beautiful CDs I've ever heard. I am stunned into silence by Josh's voice and definitely want to go to a concert!<br /><br />The first time I listened to the entire CD I stayed up all night in a state of heady intoxication.

B000002KE2|5.0|On the aptly titled fourth album from the Heavy Metal Gods, they pretty much stick to the same doomy, sludgy, Down-esque sound that got them famous while experimenting with some new sounds. The album opens with the sonic blast of Wheels Of Confusion, which has been known to damage ears while played at a high volume (Only kiddin'). Then comes the heavy smasher Tomorrow's Dream, which is one of the band's signature songs. Then comes what is probably the worst song on the album: Changes. Don't get me wrong, it's OK, but it gets SO boring, just hearing the piano tinkle away while Ozzy keeps moaning. Calls for some high-velocity guitar. Then comes the bizzare 'song' FX, which is simply composed of little squeks and bangs. The first half closes with the spectacular Supernaut, an epic about space travel. The next song, Snowblind is probably the most famous song off this album. Great heaviness. Cornucopia, which comes next, is one of the album's best. It includes heavy music, great lyrics, and everything that makes a Sabbath song a Sabbath song. Laguna Sunrise is a Santana-sounding instrumental that shows Sabbath's lighter yet heavier sound. St Vitus' Dance is another hard-whacker, one of the album's heaviest. This song inspired the name of a later doom band, Saint Vitus. The album closes with the mighty and spectacular Under The Sun, which closes a classic album in full headbanger spirit. This is probably one of the most underrated albums from this band, because it is usually stands in the shadow of Master Of Reality and Paranoid, which are actually lesser albums. This is one of the most heavy albums of the 1970's. If ya don't own this album, you are not worthy of the title 'metalhead'.
0553573403|5.0|I must start off by acknowledging George Martin as a master of contemporary fantasy. This book is so very different from all the other fantasy books I've read so far, that I don't know if I'll ever treat fantasy the same way again!<br />I had tried to read this book twice earlier - each time I would start off, and then keep it down after reading just 3-4 pages. The violence that hits the reader right from the beginning, the brutality of justice, the nakedness of human emotions (lust, greed, pride and honour) that make the characters seem ironically more human than ever - these features made the book seem very &quot;adultish&quot; and realistic when compared to any other fantasy series. Tolkien had not prepared me for that!<br />As I came to learn, there are no heroes in the book, and no character can be personified as completely &quot;good&quot; or completely &quot;evil. Hence, the traditional fantasy theme of good fighting evil is done away with, and the characters make the story twist and turn every time they reveal one more aspect of their complex and very-human personalities.<br />Fantasy readers should be warned that magic does not form a significant part of the storyline (at least for the first book of the series), though it does form part of the backdrop (The Others etc.). This was one of the reasons why I hesitated to take up this book. After reading David Gemmel, David Eddings and Raymond Feist, reading fantasy sans magic seemed almost impossible. But now that I have gotten past that block, I realize how exciting and incredibly realistic such fantasy can be, even without magic. But it takes a very accomplished and talent author like George Martin to make it so.<br />There are also no deus ex machina characters, or orphans destined to save the world. Heroes are tormented with difficult choices which carry no honour, and villains act quickly and without mercy or remorse. At times, the brutality really shocked me. Sympathetic or &quot;hero-like&quot; characters often died unexpected deaths at the hands of cruel &quot;villains&quot; which went unavenged and often unmourned, and even little children were forced to assume very burdensome responsibilities for the sake of the greater good. At times, it made me wonder if the book was a bit too negative in its overall outlook and portrayal of personalities.<br />The writing style is dramatically different - each chapter is focused on a single character and the events surrounding him/her. While all the characters are tightly linked together and the story moves forward cohesively, often it takes us away from one character at the heights of action and moves diametrically opposite to another character far away, making us wait patiently for the story to revolve back again. No doubt, this is a difficult style to adopt, especially for a four part series, as it necessitates that each character be treated with the same amount of respect and detail as the others, however important or un-important they may seem initially.<br />I've always believed in the philosophy of reading books for the inherent concepts and potential ideas that are contained within, and not for just pure literary pleasure. This was one book that completely justified that philosophy. It gives a peek into a world of Kings and ordinary men, where struggle for power neither leads to decisive victories nor noble victors, where choices men make have outcomes that are too perceptible and painful, and where the cost of achieving peace is high enough to make men question the ends and means.<br />On the whole, this is a must-read for any fantasy reader.rs often died unexpected deaths at the hands of cruel &quot;villains&quot; which went unavenged and often unmourned, and even little children were forced to assume very burdensome responsibilities for the sake of the greater good.

B000002J1U|5.0|The essential linchpin in Led Zeppelin's discography<br />Led Zeppelin's third album, unimaginatively titled LED ZEPPELIN III, shows the band in a much different light than the preceding two records.  The first two records were constructed around hard-hitting, direct music, with a fairly straightforward sound.  LED ZEPPELIN showed the band capable of classic dynamics and very textured music, sowing seeds to come.  ZEPPELIN II, though, was a very direct sounding record, much more built on the riffs and acid blues of such contemporaries like Cream, Hendrix, and Jeff Beck.  This all led to the general opinion that the band had a fairly limited sound, drawing frequent comparisons to Black Sabbath.<br />LED ZEPPELIN III, however, blew all such stereotypes out of the water.  While this record still has a heavy, metallic sound on a couple of tracks, by and large III is largely an accoustic affair, especially on the last half of the album.  Even the hard rockers aren't nearly as straight-forward as the ones found on their first two LPs.  The second side shows Zeppelin quite masterfully working in a folk-blues tradition, turning in some wonderful music.  The band still plays the blues, but these blues are seen through the prism of III's sound.  Instead of building the blues on pummeling riffs they instead focus more on an acoustic foundation, giving the record a rich, warm sound.  The only real fault here is that they left off the B-Side \\"Hey Hey What Can I Do,\\" which fits in perfectly with III and would have been a very strong addition to the album.  The very last song, which there's nothing wrong with, I don't much care for, but that's just my personal taste. <br />After ZEPPELIN III, Zeppelin went on to bigger and better things.  However, just like The Beatles' RUBBER SOUL and REVOLVER, III stands as the linchpin in the band's discography, because it is here that the evolution really begun to propel the band to a rich, varied sound.  Black Sabbath never made this transition; they kept pummeling out the hard rock riffs and overtly satanic imagery.  Page said that after they made III they never got compared to Sabbath again.  Here Zeppelin shows themselves capable of much more than the blues-based heavy metal of their first two records.  Had Zeppelin never made this transition, they would never have been such the major force in rock that they are today.  In the end, had they kept churning out the same sound as the first two, the records would worsen and become stagnate, with no real musical evolution or growth.  This is the record that set them on their journey to their most varied, musically adventurous albums (ZOSO, HOUSES, PHYSICAL GRAFFITI, and, though not wholly successful, IN THRU THE OUT DOOR).  This is the album that set them apart, and really made you curious where they would go to next.  Obviously these were some talented musicians with the ability to play with a very elastic sound, encompassing far more than conventional heavy metal and blues-based hard rock.<br />Over all, LED ZEPPELIN III stands as quite an achievement.  Unfortunately, many of the Zeppelin imitators and copy the hard, direct music of the first couple of records and forget about how artistically adventurous this band was.  In many ways, this is the record that propelled them into the monolithic presense they have over rock, because this is the record that should the world Zeppelin was a lot more than just a stereotypical heavy metal group.

B0001I55OC|1.0|This was terrible.  I really enjoyed the book, it was well written, and seemed like it was kind of historically accurate.  At least from the viewpoint of someone who never studied the period.  But they took everything from the book that was good, and threw it out the window to make this load.  The joust, the insane knight, the translators, the attack on the monastary, all gone.  Frank Gordon turns into a sniveling Marine?  Marek wasn't an heroic character like in the book, Chris adds nothing to the movie, and Donniger?  Why was he against bringing them back?  They never bothered to explain that, really!<br /><br />Instead, we get a French translator, Gordon takes a trip to the past (why???), the professor is Chris's father and Chris isn't an archaeologist, the monastary is reduced to a bit part, the lady Claire has no intrigue to her...  I was bitterly disappointed in this weak film.  Oddly enough, my girlfriend kind of liked it.  So, what do I know?  But if you enjoyed the book, you're probably not going to like this film.  If you like formulaic movies that insult your sensibilities, you're going to LOVE this movie!
B0001UL7RY|1.0|In getting to know Avril through her music, we have discerned that she infact has nothing worth getting to know. Maple leaves are more beautiful than her, and they have a lot more pizazz and personality than she does. Stupid Canuck. Avril's turnoffs include: Boys, men, and people attempting to do her a favor and offer her some guidance. I tell you, if none of us out there ever got any guidance or tips on getting through being a teen, we'd have all ended up like Avril; a spoiled little b*tch unable to do for herself and who will no doubt be unable to file her own taxes by herself let alone live by herself. Nobody wants to hear everything you hate, Avril. And nobody especially wants to hear you making money off all your little clone fans that like to hear everything you hate. I swear, The Offspring's' &quot;Cool to Hate&quot; was MADE for Avril. With lyrics like &quot;I hate the jocks, I hate the geeks, I hate the trendies, but I also hate the freaks/I'm only happy when I'm in my misery&quot;, the song describes her perfectly.
B0001W8Q9Y|5.0|As a fan of this band for 20 years I as well looked forward to where they were headed. I pre paid last year and when I received the c.d. it has not left the player. In my view the best thing since Brave. I feel it is there Sgt Pepper. I was 17 years old when Sgt Pepper came out and I knew first hand what a different direction was like. I e mailed the band and indicated that as far as I was concerned there is no one doing this kind of music. If you love music get this album. Play it at least 10 times and tell me it is not the best thing you ever heard.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|Avril is canadian, and as her country loves to flaunt, it is a half-english-speaking, half-french-speaking country. Therefore, when Avril says &quot;Skayer (I'm a punk because I spell phonetically) Boi&quot;, don't you think she'd be pronouncing it &quot;bwa&quot;, similar to the way the french word for drink is pronounced (&quot;bois&quot;)? Just askin'. Oh, wait a minute, I'm a Avril fan, so I can't be an intelligent person or show my vulnerable side. So, um...I hate you!!!... and school sucks!!! <br />When was the last time Cobain was the main feature of a teen mag some kid below asks? The year was 1992. The magazine: Sassy, which was even more popular than 17 at the time. Cobain arranged the interview and shoot himself. You're welcome.
B000003TA2|2.0|Whereas &quot;Sister&quot; and &quot;Daydream Nation&quot; have a lot of creativity, I just don't like this one. The only songs that I like is &quot;Mote&quot; and the &quot;Scooter-Jinx&quot; effects. for its long five minute jam at the end but that's it. Otherwise &quot;Goo&quot; is unintersitingly melodic and noisy.<BR>My least favorite album.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|There's kids on here talking about the old slipknot as if old slipknot was as amazing as say, old Metallica. Look kids, the one commendable thing I can say Slipknot is doing is contributing to the Death Tribute Album titled Within the Mind which should come out in the coming months. Aside from that, if you are growing tired of Slipknot and are perhaps, fed up with their change in direction be sure to check out Metal bands like Children of Bodom, In Flames, Morbid Angel, Death(obviously), Carcass, etc. to hear GOOD and heavy $hit.
B00020HEL6|5.0|I am in love with this album but I find it a little unsettling. <br />Renee's voice is to die for and she's clearly an old soul, but  she's singing about romantic matters that are primarily the province of adult life. <br />Her sultry pipes work magic on torch songs like &quot;Someone to watch over me&quot; (one of the best renditions ever recorded!) and &quot;A love that will last.&quot; Her fantastic phrasing makes easy work of hoppers like &quot;Is you is or is you ain't my baby&quot; and &quot;Meet me, midnight.&quot; <br />Renee's proficiency as a singer makes you forget her age, and therein lies the problem. Young teens should not require &quot;a love that will last&quot; any more than a pair of socks that won't wear out before next month. The suggestive lyrics of &quot;Midnight at the Oasis&quot; may be perfectly acceptable when delivered by a fully-grown Maria Muldaur, but should a 14-year-old child be offering to &quot;slip off to a sand dune real soon and kick up a little dust&quot;? Think about it.<br />I'm giving this CD 5 stars but the producers ought to examine their conscience a little.
B000148KK2|5.0|I think I have all of Diana's CD's, and I enjoy this one every bit as much if not more than the others.  The music is refreshing and it is nice to hear her get away from old standards and into some new material.  More power to her!
038073186X|1.0|You may not want to print this as it's a put-down of Duhane. He should have his head examined for such a disgraceful novel, especial after writing MYSTIC RIVER, a superb piece of fiction. He says he writes to please himself. If so, he should either get his brain unaddled or quit fiction writing and only teach how NOT to write a very bad novel.
B00005JN0A|5.0|Eurotrip was the funniest. The cast was hilarious and I am now an instant fan of Scott Mechlowicz. He gave a great performance and he's not bad on the eyes either. I hope him to see him in future movies.
B000002LLC|5.0|I got this CD recently to complete my Madonna collection. I wasn't expecting a lot from it but I was pleasantly surprised to find this was amazingly good! It's different from her other albums. Madonna takes on a more 1930s/1940s sound that went with her character in the movie Dick Tracy. What I think is best about this album is that it showcases Madonna's range. She's able to take on an upbeat song like \\"Vogue\\" while playing a sultry temptress with \\"He's a Man.\\" There really isn't a track I would feel like skipping but some of the highlights-<br />1- \\"He's a Man\\" The song starts off slowly and builds up as it goes on. Madonna pushes her vocal register, really digging for the low notes and making it all come off as sounding powerful and alluring. One of the best Madonna songs period.<br />2- \\"Now I'm Following You\\" Part I is a simple little song that has Madonna singing a duo with another male. It has a classic sound to it. Then Part II is the more upbeat version of it, sort of a remix shall we say. It has a funkier beat and sound clips mixed in from other songs and from her character's role in the movie. A nice song overall.<br />3- \\"Vogue\\" - It's her hit song, what else needs to be said?<br />4- \\"Something to Remember\\" A song that simply hinges on emotions. It has a piano background with a few other instruments now and then. Her voice is heavy and it's rather simplistic but that gives it it's strength. She sings a song of gratitude sort of to someone she once loved but lost for whatever reason. Madonna convinces you the listener that this is something that really could have happened.<br />5 - \\"Back in Business\\" Sounds rather big-band. This song's strength comes in its lyrics. Only the chorus part is loud and full of energy. The rest of the song is kept together by a steady beat that's rather quiet while Madonna's voice goes over and keeps your attention.<br />  There are other good songs here. \\"Hanky Panky\\" was released as a single (the second and last of this album) and goes along with Madonna's Sex-era. It's rather naughty and risque but fun. Not her best but entertaining. \\"More\\" and \\"Crybaby\\" sound very Broadway to me. Sound-wise, it could easily come from a musical such as \\"Chicago.\\" While I've never been too much impressed by the movie, I think this album is among Madonna's best work. While it's counted as a soundtrack sense it includes the musical numbers from the movie, it's more like a simple Madonna CD done in a different style and mindset. Definately worth your money and time.um) and goes along with Madonna's Sex-era. It's rather naughty and risque but fun.

B0001NBMBC|5.0|im suprised, i have to plead honesty on it, i am suprised that they pulled off their big changes to their image,reputation and what their noted for.  They didnt change EVERYTHING!! they are still heavy loud and brutal but in a more mature and evolved way, i guess thats the best i can put it.  Slipknot didnt change into a whole different band you traitors, they grew out of the 100$ pure agression and i think, in my opinion, saw the imperfections in Iowa, and polished them into a whirlwind of both melodic melodys and brutal riffs (with out the cursing).  I admire them for doing that, and i am dissapointed in them.  Because on the other hand, surfacing is their nation anthem and the pivital song of their carrer, that chours is what made that song and its too bad they ditched the furious language factor, but lets not be a bunch of sour puss' people, i think they did a very good job and they changed for the better, but slipknot is still who they were when they wore their orange jumpsuites and will remain to its loyal maggots as long as we are loyal to the leaders and founders of the knot. 012345678.
B00015HVI8|4.0|To be honest, and Im sure MGM will do this, wait until they put all the series on blue laser DVD - Blue laser DVD players just came out and when they expand and replace red laser DVD's you will be kicking your self for not waiting - because of the storage capacity Im sure they could fit an entire season on 1-2 DVDs as opposed to five.
B00000425L|1.0|Oh yes the perfect modern pianist, fantastic technique, giant reportorie, well practiced and all his playing sounds just like the music is written. Yep, sounds just like a machine pounding out &quot;perfect&quot; notes on a keyboard. No wonder Classical piano is a dying art form, because with the likes of a &quot;cardboard piano robot&quot; like Ashkenazy, the real feel of the music is completely lost. Why is this supreme typist so excessively recorded? fits well into the Disneyland mentality of our capitalist system I suppose. May as well listen to a wind up toy.
B00003CXCT|1.0|Go ahead and buy this one if you want but they most likely will put out much better versions of this later. I would wait till you can buy they whole series 1-6 on blue laser dvd which has recently been made available. Blue laser dvds have a much greater storage capacity and as time goes by they could probably put all six films with all the extras on one dvd. Speaking of extras there are still a considerable amount of sceans that Lucus never put into the originals and most likly for the new ones as well. Like a new hope has a different beginning where it shows luke watching the star destroyer chase from the planet, in Empire there is a whole wampa/ snow creature plot where 3po uses the creatures to kill storm troopers, their is also more footage of luke recovering and he almost kisses leia. ROTJ also has extended sceans such as after jabbas death where all the companions meet to board thier ships to head back to the alliance. All of these sceans were fully produced and were available on the starwars behind the magic CD. It is sceans like this that make DVDs worth buying and if they were incorporated into the films Star wars would be amazing and it would give fans a whole new appreciation of the films. Lucus should take notes off Peter jackson if you ask me.
B0001GL3K4|2.0|There were a few funny moments and a few aaahhh moments but they were few and far between.  The boredom in between and the grade school potty humor were much more noticeable.  Try to rent it if you want to see it.  Not worth buying.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|Most who watch movies never realize that the music takes the words and the scenes to another level. It can draw your heart in when times are down and lift your spirits up when something goes right, and Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King sountrack does just that. Even without the pictures and voices the music captures you still and it is simply an amazing sountrack. <BR> Even if you have never watched the movie triligy before and it is your first time listening to the soundtrack, I know you'll fall in love with the beautiful music it has to offer. No words on paper can do this soundtrack justice! <BR> Anyone can sit down and listen to this soundtrack and really enjoy the music it has to offer. It brings out the best music in the Return of the King and I HIGHLY recommend this sountrack to anyone!
B000002U82|5.0|Perspective buyers, you are viewing the greatest album of all time and one of the world's greatest works of art; Roger Water's and Pink Floyd's magnum opus, Dark Side of the Moon.  Just over two years ago, I was almost entirely unaware of Pink Floyd and knew nothing of their incredible legacy.  I had heard of &quot;the Dark Side,&quot; but I had never listened to it.  And then, I finally bought it.  Dark Side of the Moon was the most important purchase of my life.  There is no album in the world that is so touchingly beautiful, or so mind-bendingly powerful as Dark Side of the Moon and it will never fail to amaze you.  <BR>The sound of a heartbeat resonates through the speakers, confused noise and, finally, cries erupt in a startling crescendo that leads into the ethereal beauty of Breathe and then to the frantic, constant motion of On the Run.  As time runs by, with its powerful solo and poignant lyrics, you will find yourself in a reprise and then fall gently into the soundscapes and primal screams of the Great Gig in the Sky.  Even if you are not familiar with the album, it is more than likely that you know the next track, Money, which has occupied a position of high standing on FM radio for decades.  Us and Them is simply beautiful, no matter how you cut it, and is so wonderfully humanitarian.  Any Colour You Like is a delight and the album is then closed with the touching power of the ever-so-sympathetic Brain Damage, wonderful homage to former frontman, Syd Barrett, and seamlessly flows into the great final cry of Eclipse.  <BR>My life has been made better and more beautiful by this album.  After every listening of Dark Side of the Moon, I am left feeling fulfilled and enriched.  So many important facets of human life are addressed in such a compassionate and thoughtful manner that it will leave you feeling that, for that point in time, everything in the world has come together, to resonate as one, just like that mysterious and strangely beautiful heartbeat.
B0001UL7RY|3.0|People have to stop hating her enormous success.  Sure her songs arent the most original or great for that matter.  This album is what it is - decent.  Think she sucks? Then go out there and prove you're better.  But, give credit where it's due.  Here's a teen who'll laugh herself to the bank. Chill out folks, she'll be forgotten tomorrow.
B00001ZWTT|4.0|I can remember seeing Wild Wild West opening weekend back in the summe of 1997. I was so excited to see it after hearing the theme song and knowing my boy Will Smith was going to be in it. I thought the moive was kind of stupid, but I really enjoy this moive.<br />James West(Smith) is one of the top U.S. Secret Service Agents. President Grant is worried about a man Dr. Arliss Loveless(Branagh). He has been kidnapping different scientists who are the tops of their respective fields. West is teamed with one of the top U.S. marshalls Artemus Gordon(Kline). The two are hot on the trail and find a beautiful woman named Rita(Hayek) who is after Loveless as well because he kidnapped her father. Now are two agents must stop Loveless in time, before he can release his horrible creations upon the U.S.<br />Will Smith wasn't really the right choice for James West. The complaint is legit that a black man shouldn't have been this big agent right after slaverly had just ended. It's ridiculous saying segregation took place up to the sixties. However, if you look past that flaw, then Smith really works. He is Will Smith and he has that Will Smith charm. He's a good action star and he excels in the action parts of the movie.<br />Kevin Kline is also really good in the movie. I never watched the tv show, so I don't know how these two compare. Kline is good in the role and he runs with it. He's funny as the crafty inventor and he's just Kevin Kline.<br />Salma Hayek is gorgeous in the moive. The was the first one I ever saw her in and she had me from the first time I saw her. Her acting isn't all that great in the movie, she's just there to simply look at for an hour and half, and it works.<br />The special effects are really good in the film. Once again I wouldn't expect anything less from a moive with Will Smith in it. They aren't the best ones from his movies that he's been in, but they are good. The tarantula looked kind of cool and there is plenty of stuff blowing up in it.<br />This was a summer blockbuser movie. The acting is terrible and so is the plot, but it's fun. The acting is fun, the special effects are great and it's a nice escape for two hours. This movie is easy to find cheap so pick it up for a cheap good time.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|There is not much more I can say about this show that hasn't already been said very eloquently by nearly 900 others, and you know if that many cared to comment there has to be at least a thousand times as many that feel the same way. I came to this show not as a Joss Whedon fan (have never watched either Buffy or Angel) but rather as one who will at least sample all genre offerings on the tube. I was sold on this show from the first episode, and watched all the others except one (darned VCR screwup) and was really upset to see it canceled.<br />I have been a fan of SF for nearly forty years, all the classic authors and all serious attempts to bring it to the screen, large and small. I don't expect anyone to take my word for it, but I know good SF when I read it or see it, and this is the real deal folks. Perhaps it sounds a bit cheesy on the surface, but give it a chance and you will discover fantastic character development enacted by a perfect cast, with stories that will resonate in your mind for days afterwards, and that compell you to watch them again and again. I preordered the set and got it just a couple of days after its release. Since then I have watched each episode at least twelve times and they still seem as fresh as ever.<br />I have no idea why there have been a few negative comments here about Firefly. There are many shows that I don't care for, but the last thing I would do is post a negative review of anything here. What you like is your business, and it is no concern of mine if you want to spend your money on something I wouldn't give a second glance to. It is also puzzling how anyone can not like this show, but then again that's what makes the world go round. If you still haven't seen Firefly, rent it if you can, borrow it from someone, but my bet is you will later end up back here to buy the set for yourself, and will become one of the growing number of fans that are waiting impatiently for the Big Damn Movie, &quot;Serenity.&quot;<br />Joss, keep Serenity flying and I'll keep watching!
B0001NBMBC|1.0|If you are a true fan of slipknot you will buy this cd listen to it then smash the s@#! out of it. There are songs like vermillion that makes nickleback seem like speed metal. When Corey went to do the stone sour album is when it all went bad it split up the band and Corey sang the new slipknot album like a stone sour one there is only two descent songs welcome and pulse of the maggots. The pulse of this maggot is dead this will be in my opion the end of the band way to go Corey!!
B0001NBMBC|4.0|this is basically a much more musical version of iowa.  good album:<br />pros:  vocals sound very good.  corey taylor has a great voice.  the rest of the band deserves even more credit for the excellent music on this album.  drums still one of the most impressive in music.  <br />cons:  lyrics still need work.  better than iowa, but corey still hasn't broken away from the cliques, such as overuse of the words &quot;inside&quot; or &quot;fall away&quot; (though i'm not sure fall away was used).  but words like that, you know the ones.  <br />song by song: <br />1.  Prelude 3.0-  really good musically.  shows that the drummer can play different styles, not just the insane fast stuff.  kind of eerie in a way.  <br />2.  The Blister Exists-  incredible.  it switches up on ya in the middle of the song...the drums start playing this marching thing, and it's wonderful.  this also shows the slipknot has finally realised that their guitars have 3 strings on the top, as well.  and they put them to good use, as well.  <br />3.  Three Nil-  could have easily been on iowa, but not one of my favorite tracks on the album.  a little repetitive.  <br />4.  Duality-  pretty standard slipknot track.  don't listen to it too much though, you'll be singing it for a week.<br />5.  Opium of the People-  wicked track.  great guitar work.  <br />6.  Circle-  cool little acoustic track.  not what you'd expect from slipknot, but a very good track.  the end is REALLY cool<br />7.  Welcome-  probably a fan favorite.  wicked fast, hard the whole way through.  <br />8.  Vermillion-  awesome song.  creepy-ish music.  one of my favorite tracks.  <br />9.  Pulse of the Maggots-  meh.  i don't really care for this one.  good drum work, but... i don't know.  i just don't care for it.  <br />10.  Before I Forget-  the music to this track reminds me of Korn.  i usually skip it, but the vocals sound sort of hardcore influenced, which is pretty cool.  <br />11.  Vermillion pt. 2-  not so great acoustic track.  i know people whine about people talking about how they don't like the acoustic tracks, but this one just isn't very good.  hey, i liked the first one!<br />12.  The Nameless-  typical wicked fast slipknot song...but the chorus to it...is very soft.  good example of how great corey's voice is.  <br />13.  The Virus of Life-  one of my favorite slipknot songs ever.  VERY creepy song.  they actually made use of the trash can drummer in it.  <br />14.  Danger - Keep Away-  BEAUTIFUL.  i can't believe this band wrote this song.  the lryics could have been better, but the music in this song is wonderful.  the sound of the keyboard in it reminds me of &quot;everything in it's right place&quot; by radiohead.  this song isn't quite that good, but it's incredible work for slipknot.  <br />all in all, great album from slipknot, and if they decide to keep going (i've heard this may be the last we hear from them), i'll certainly buy their next album.  good stuff on here for fans of heavy music, a few good tracks for slow acoustic fans, and there's even a track alt-rock fans like me can appriciate!
B000089RVX|3.0|This cd is okay<br />it doesn't give off the &quot;gothic&quot; image. Very few songs give off that misunderstood,misguidance theme. No one seems to really feel like this has no hype. But personally i like it and i see nothing wrong with it ,yet i don't believe all the hype. I think there song &quot;going under&quot; is there best. Just my opinion.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|Ok. I have already written a review last week...but I just snapped, when I read a  review from another person mentioning that all the people complaining about how bad this album are the  UNloyal maggots. Listen F**KER...HOW DARE YOU, question WHO is, and WHO isn't...a LOYAL fan. I am as loyal as all of the other maggots writing how bad this album is. It ISN'T SLIPKNOT or IOWA raw intensity. It = radio friendly BULL$hit. The people who will love this album, are the ones that will probably not know OLD slipknot.....some loyal ones will accept it but FORCE themselves to accept it, for what it is and try to swallow the fact, that their favorite band evolved in the most wrong way possible. I just know....I hate this album :-(....One guy mentioned how this album will lose millions but gain new ones....You couldn't be more RIGHT pal. This album, I can gaurentee you, will start off a WAR, even more brutal then ANYTHING SLIPKNOT has ever put out. Just by the OLD fans going at the THROATS of the people ( New fans ) praising this album. YEAH, that is how powerful SLIPKNOT is. I can SOOOO see that happening :-/. Its going to be WAR man. I appreciate evolving....but like I told a friend of mine, when my band does its thing....one promise to my future fans....whenever that time is to evolve...I am only going to get more extreme :-). I am strongly considering taking off all of my Slipknot posters all over my room and putting away my SLipknot t-shirts into a closet for awhile, until Slipknot can hopefully reGROUP! :-( :-( :-(. I am NOT a new school metal hater btw....Slipknot WAS - my favorite band......not anymore *SOBS*.
1402532903|3.0|The Lovely Bones is a beautifully written novel about Susie Salmon, a 14-year old girl who has to watch from heaven as her family and friends cope with her death after she is brutally raped and murdered. Susie narrates the story and tells how she uses her spiritual presence on earth to help lead to the murderer and cause of her disappearance.  Often times she gets frustrated since she has to watch a world in which she can no longer live in.  Heaven was perfect, but watching where she wished she could be-which was most of the time-was not.  For her, heaven seemed to be on earth with the people and things she loved.  You pick up very easily that she felt this way through the stories she tells of her past, and the way she looks at them with regret.  The mesmerizing and almost haunting first few chapters keep you wanting to read more.  You find yourself asking many questions about the book in which you keep reading in order to get answered.  But as soon as these questions fade away in your mind, there seems to be no point in continuing the reading.  This, along with many other problems with the book, made me almost dislike reading it, despite the fact that I was indulged in the beginning of the book.<br />Lovely Bones was about 100 pages too long.  I'm not just saying this because i dislike reading long books, but because there was no point in the novel continuing on as long as it did.  It was like watching Lord of the Rings, anxiously waiting for it to end, knowing that the plot can only go downhill after a certain point. Another problem was that often times Susie said how different characters felt and what they were thinking throughout the book.  This would make sense if it was a book written in third person, but how would Susie be able to tell? She doesn't have a sixth sense.  Another problem with Susie is that her writing sounds like a well-educated 35-year-old adult, which makes sense since that's what the person who actually wrote it is.  But there were too many occasions when I thought that there is no way, that any 14 year old person would be able to write this, not even Diego Nunez.  She also switches from idea to idea way too frequently, and then goes back to the previous one once more.  I, along with many others I'm sure found this extremely confusing at times.  Although there were many problems with the book, I still give Alice Sebold plenty of credit.  She's an incredible writer, and has skill that many people could never imagine having.  Her ability to write things that can make you laugh and cry seems to come so easily for her.  So I recommend that everyone read this book, even with my dislike for it, just to experience Alice Sebold's writing.
1881273156|5.0|Gary Chapman is 100% correct.  The concept is so simple it makes me wonder why I had to read it in a book.  As I was reading the book I kept saying &quot;of course&quot; to myself.  I have put this on my yearly reading list so I don't forget the vital information Gary Chapman has shared.  I have also given this book away many times as a wedding gift.
B0000DZTIW|5.0|What can I say...but %^$&amp; Brilliant.
0812034465|4.0|The book is about a killer and a man who was accused of raping a woman, The part I didn't like was where the dog was shot, and I like when that little girl who talks like an adult was wearing the ham costume, and the part when she tries to bite Boo. I recommend this book because I think that it was a good story, but if you dont want to read you should just watch the movie.  The movie is the same as the book.
B00001R3GC|5.0|Sticky Fingers finds the Stones riding at their peek and white-hot.  It is also the first time the Stones were out from under the shadow of the Beatles.  Somehow, when they were no longer competing with the Beatles they were able to come into their own.  Freedom was good for them.<br />The Stones were also free from the sixties and all that \\"revolution\\" nonsense.  The Stones could be their own kind of \\"cool\\" and millions ate it up.<br />Production values also changed.  As a close listen to this record will show, stereophonic sound now had a presence in which the listener seemed to find himself in the midst of the instruments and musicians.  This was exciting at the time and gave the listener a new sense of realism in the playing.  Later in the seventies, this approach was driven so far that many records felt claustrophobic.  The sound was so up close and precise that it became unreal.  In the Stones' hands, however, the sound was tight but the feeling was loose and free.<br />The album opens with \\"Brown Sugar\\" and \\"Sway\\".  Wonderful lyrics, good solos, rocking rhythm.  Definitely forbidden subject matter.  But this was all a part of the new era of freedom and frankness of the time.

B0001AVZA8|2.0|I believe this was a case of the film being overhyped to me before I saw it.  It was ok, but nothing incredible.  I thought Nicolson and Diane Keaton were quite funny and really at their best, but the material was a little dumb, the events hokey and contrived, and the film was too long.  They could have cut about 30 minutes out of it, streamlined it somewhat, and it would have been better.  I saw it with a person their age who despised it as being absolutely stupid and unreal.  I guess my suggestion is, is you're 60-ish, you might really hate it.  It is worth the price of a rental or pay-per-view, but to me, only barely.  Wait until it comes on cable and you can see it for free, but it is worth seeing.
B00005JMEW|2.0|I am angry that i will never have these two hours of my life back. Watching this supposed entertainment which I will not refer to as a film, I came to an amazing realisation. Tarantino has actually never done anything original. Have you ever noticed how all of his stuff feels strangely familiar? That being said anyone who thinks it's funny to base an entire film (2 in fact) on a pregnant bride who is shot in the head and then raped whilst in a coma is just plane lame and stupid. No I wasn't shocked, I didn't even think it was funny, i just thought it was a desprate attention grab, badly directed, badly written, badly acted. I even hated the garish, overdone cinematography. So why two stars? Because the soundtrack is great and because Tarantino pays homage to an interesting genre, despite the fact that he manages to screw it up so dramatically. I seriously can't understand why this immature, 15 year old geek with a.d.d calls himself a film maker... Go back to the video store you came from and rent something by a real director. Dreadful rubbish on all levels.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I guess I'm confused with the cries that slipknot have gone soft.  Sure, there are a few acoustic songs on here, but every other song is actually more intense than their previous stuff.  The guitars are utilized with more skill, Corey sounds even more emotional, and they're not all about killing and cussing anymore.  In my opinion, that makes this album more genuine.  And what a trip, I love every song on here, fast or slow.  They allowed themselves to grow up, and in the process, it feels like they became harder.  And, as far as the cussing, grow up.  Tool did the same thing from Aenema to Lateralus (which also kicks ass) and I don't hear many people complaining of the lack of cursing.  Kudos to slipknot, the experimentation is working!

B0001NBMBC|5.0|Sorry for the constant reviews but what josh said on june 1st is the truth. I wonder if you haters even realize how hard it is to make it and still be different from all the crap that comes out. I cant believe that someone actually thinks that slipknot has turned into a band like staind. Now if there was such a thing as being sold out that is them. Their first album was unique and heavy, then we get 13 your old girl acoustic songs just so they could make money. If they had stuck to their roots they would still be one of my favorite bands. The only heavy bands left now-a-days are Mudvayne, Tool, Pantera, Down, Metallica, and of course Slipknot please get the album and support the new dynasty of heavy metal.

B000003TBP|3.0|Is this album, called groundbreaking and classic when it was released, going to matter to anyone in 10 years?  Of course not.  <br />ODELAY was embraced at a time when American culture was drenched in irony and pop-culture regurgitation.  Not surprisingly, the ironic-nostalgia fad ran SO deep that no one stopped to think about how the music would age once the retro-waves it was riding crashed on the sand...hence the blind worship of this record.<br />Beck also benefited from the bizarre notion that &quot;blending styles&quot; was an inherently noble act.  Didn't matter if the styles were blended clumsily.  It was all about the musical blender, man.  Basically, it was multi-culturalism dogma creeping into the music scene, and the results weren't pretty.<br />Once rocks fans clear their heads of all the bad irony and musical crossbreeding forced on them in the past ten years, ODELAY's status is going to take a serious tumble.<br />That said, the record isn't all bad.  &quot;Jack-Ass&quot; is a timeless tune, &quot;Derelict&quot; is damn catchy, and &quot;Novocane&quot; is a nice jolt of adrenaline.  Otherwise though, there are a lot of forgettable moments on ODELAY, which precludes it from being deemed a masterpiece.

I really liked Norah Jones and she opened me up to jazzy singing but Renee's style enchants me all the way. Her songs are catchier and a lot more fun to listen to. It should come as no surprise she's doing so well in the rankings. Let's face it, we got ourselves a winner here.
0805062971|5.0|I shall divide the review into two parts, the first part for those who haven't seen the movie and the second for those who have.<br />For those who haven't:<BR>To be honest I don't know which is better to experience first so I shan't comment on that except to say that both are excellent. Fight Club is about the friendship between the narrator and Tyler - a guy he meets. The narrator is a mindless participant of the corporate rat-race, an insomniac, meterialistic and so out of touch with humanity as an ideal that the closest he comes to genuine feeling is going to support groups pretending to have various types of terminal illness. Tyler is the exact opposite - pushing all boundaries, idealistic, anarchistic, self-destructive and loving it. Together, they establish Fight Club, a place for the nameless faces of middle corporate America to remind themselves they're alive by belting the daylights out of one another. However, soon the anarchistic philosophy takes off on its own..<br />For those who have:<BR>The book is more extreme than the movie! Tyler's philosophy is much more radical - in the movie he does not seem to want anyone to get hurt but in the novel, that's exactly what he wants. Be prepared for a more confronting experience - including some scenes that are more placid in the movie. And you thought the film warranted an adults-only rating...!<br />The style of the book is quite difficult - very easy to read but the narrator's style, while not exactly stream-of-consciousness, is very coloured and colourful - so much so as to completely overwhelm the story. It is however the themes of dissatisfaction with mediocrity, the cynicism about heroes and the belief that to be saved you have to reach rock-bottom first (and that's achieved big-time in the book!) that make it so memorable.

B0001NBMBC|4.0|A very good CD overall, those who say they have gone all \\"soft\\" now, your entitled to your opinion... i guess some people lose taste in music, and some don't. Right after 5-6 listens i went back and started listening to the 1st two albums, just to see what the difference was.... aside from the acoustic tracks; not much, same old slipknot with dark melodies here and there. one thing i will say is that NOW they sound like a band with 5 people in it rather then 9....... oh and i wouldn't be surprised if they didn't play any \\"soft\\" stuff on their live tour set this summer. Good slipknot album. \\"Slipknot\\">>>>\\"Iowa\\">>>>\\"Vol. 3\\"
0739309013|5.0|I've read every one of Grisham's books, the last ten or so immediately upon release. I've never felt cheated, always entertained. I read negative reviews from people who don't seem to have a clue what they want from the guy. He writes excellent books that are great stories and entertaining to read. If you want classic English literature, go take a course at your local community college. If you want a guaranteed good book (which usually turns into a good movie), then keep reading Grisham, he's as good at what he does as any living author. I also think he doesn't get enough credit for stepping out (successfully) of his genre (Bleachers, A Painted House, etc.), which almost no other popular author ever does. Keep cranking them out John, there's lots of us out here who love your work.

Silent Bob<br />Tagline: \\"Just because they serve you...doesn't mean they like you.\\"<br />Plot Summary: Two guys spend a day at work in adjacent stores, and a lot of weird things happen.<br />Review and Comments: Like that summary? Very concise. The problem with writing a review of this movie is that what happens is an overview of a day at work for these two characters, and anything I say can and will ruin the jokes that make this film worth seeing. I'll attempt to apply my vast amounts of reviewing skill to this review in order to convince you why this movie is worth seeing WITHOUT giving away every single thing that happens.<br />So. Has anyone here ever worked a crappy, low-paying service job that required immense amounts of patience and customer service skills not to wring the necks of everyone that came into the place asking stupid questions? This movie is for you. Here lies a collection of anecdotes about all the things that can happen throughout the years working at a convenience store (and a video rental place) all set in the timeframe of one incredible day at work. The customers that ask stupid questions, the things that break and must be fixed, everything that can and will go wrong at once, it's all here. To give away the little things that happen would be to rob the viewer of the enjoyment of watching it happen, so I'll say no more. There are several exaggerated things that happen, comedic moments that we hope are fictional, but at its core what works about the comedy is that there are recognizable hilarious moments that we recognize if we've worked these kinds of jobs before.<br />Holding this film together, there is a relationship between the main character, Dante, (played by Brian O'Halloran) and his girlfriend Marilyn, (played by Veronica Loughran). Their relationship has lasted awhile, and they're hitting some rough spots in trying to see whether it should continue or end immediately. Most relationships hit such a spot, and the revelations they make to each other and the reactions that occur should be recognizable to anyone who's ever had a relationship that hit some rough spots (\\"I can't believe you never told me that...\\" \\"You're overreacting...\\"). Again, I'm not going to give anything away, but suffice it to say that much of the dialogue here is funny because it's true.<br />So throughout the day, strange things happen, the main characters react, and the relationship problems are discussed. The problems get worse, the tension mounts, and at the end, everything is resolved in such a way that the characters may or may not have learned something. The plot follows the standard film school outline, but the twist is that the whole story occurs in the midst of vignettes that follow the quirky things that can happen throughout a day at a customer service job (with a few fantastical, exaggerated situations) and the little stories are interwoven with the main character's dilemma in a way that I found highly entertaining.<br />The grainy, black and white style of this movie (slightly above surveillance camera quality...no joke) belies the small budget, but I found it effective. It may annoy a lot of people, though, so be forewarned. This movie doesn't look slick and polished. This movie is full of \\"inappropriate\\" language. Don't let your four-year-old watch this movie unless you want him to get kicked out or preschool for repeating the dialogue. Lots of people don't like this movie (or any of Smith's movies, come to think of it) because they complain that it has no plot and it's not funny-it's annoying. Keep that in mind. If you don't like the comedy, you won't like the movie.<br />The Bottom Line: I loved it.ilyn, (played by Veronica Loughran).

B00000F2M4|5.0|This shows the true fusion of music from all genres. Sting takes some of the best artists and blends them to a synergy that is hard to compare. His overall objective was to achieve a concert that would live far past it time. He has accomplished just that. On &quot;I Burn for You&quot; the drum solo by Omar Hakim is worth the purchse price alone. The Piano, sax and bass work along with the accompaning singers is so fabulous it took me back to the days of live concerts by the Police. I truley believe this is a video that after release on DVD will far outsell the original foray into the market.

Um...meanwhile, a woman who has lost her faith is commissioned by God to stop them, and she learns a lot about herself and about God in the process.<br />Review and Comments: There, how'd I do? It's freaking HARD to summarize what happens in this movie. Going into it, I had NO IDEA what was going to happen in this movie, and I was totally shocked by what I saw. But we'll get to that in a minute. First...<br />Main Entry: com*e*dy<br />Pronunciation: 'k&auml;-m&amp;-dE<br />Function: noun<br />Inflected Form(s): plural -dies<br />Etymology: Middle English, from Middle French comedie, from Latin comoedia, from Greek kOmOidia, from kOmos revel + aeidein to sing -- more at ODE<br />1 a : a medieval narrative that ends happily b : a literary work written in a comic style or treating a comic theme<br />2 a : a drama of light and amusing character and typically with a happy ending<br />3 : a ludicrous or farcical event or series of events<br />4 a : the comic element: humorous entertainment<br />Now. When I pay money to watch a comedy, I expect that perhaps serious things will happen, but that overall, this things will be portrayed in a humorous light and that the proceedings will go down easy, even when said comedy contains things I probably shouldn't laugh at-i.e. things most people would find offensive. I expected to find lots of things that most people find offensive in this movie, since I knew it dealt with religion and most people totally lack a sense of humor when it comes to religion. When I was discussing this movie with someone who told me that it might offend me, I said that I could handle it, because, after all, \\"God has a sense of humor.\\" I was highly amused to find that exact declaration at the beginning of this movie, in the utterly hilarious series of disclaimers. I thought I was ready for whatever happened in this movie.<br />Is everyone familiar with the term \\"Dark Comedy\\"? This term regards events that are serious, but presented in such a way that they elicit laughter...often in a \\"You have to laugh or you'll cry\\" sense. Well, if that's the definition of a dark comedy, then Dogma is a pitch black comedy of the darkest kind. There are scores of violent onscreen murders, there's angel dismemberment, and there's a scary performance that moved me to declare, \\"Wow, Ben Affleck can act.\\" In other words, there are tons of highly disturbing things that happen that I didn't expect, and I'd just like to warn people right now that while this is an intensely entertaining and overall fun film, there are some downright freaky moments that nearly caused me to have a heart attack because I wasn't expecting them. Be forewarned.<br />I'm familiar with the journey story outline taken here...a character embarks on a journey, gathers friends along the way, learns some kind of a lesson through the proceedings, and is a changed person when the movie ends. In this movie, most of the lessons are about faith; about believing in something you cannot see. Within the mythology of the film, no denomination or church has gotten everything right about God, so it's fun to watch the different reactions when the characters learn the truth about what God is really like (and the complex heavenly infrastructure, complete with angels and demons and...Muses? From Greek Mythology? Ok...).<br />I have a very strong faith in God (a faith that has helped me through many difficult times, and a faith that is so strong it moves me to capitalize the \\"G\\" in God even when I try not to), and because of my faith I can fully relate to the quandaries faced by the lead character Bethany. God can be cruel. God's plan is hard to understand. Life often doesn't make sense. And the one that people often refuse to say...God is freaking WEIRD. This movie captures that weird spirit perfectly. The quest that is given to Bethany is weird, and the companions that she picks up along the way on this journey are even weirder.<br />But central to all the weird happenings, the movie has a good heart. The things Bethany learns as she proceeds along this journey and the way she comes to a realization of God's love are moving. The whacky moments are plentiful...just about everything that happens is weird in one way or another. And the action is top notch, keeping me on the edge of my seat as I was drawn into this world. My head filled with a seemingly endless stream of questions that kept me guessing...Will the demons prevail? Will the angels succeed in thwarting God's plan, thus proving God fallible and destroying the premise upon which the world is built-that God can't be wrong? How many people will have to die strangely disturbing violent deaths before this film isn't classified as a comedy by most video stores? I was so drawn into what was happeniong that when the movie finally ended, I was still thinking about the ideas it had presented. Most people don't talk about this this, but in the bible, lots of things happen that make no sense, and people are forced to trust in God even when they don't have answers. That's what this is about, and I loved seeing it presented in this way.<br />In fact, I loved every minute of this movie...whether I was laughing or crying or covering my eyes or gasping in disgust. This movie surprised me so thoroughly that my first thought after finishing it was to watch it over again to see what I'd missed the first time. I absolutely loved it, even as I realize why it offended so many people. So maybe I can't watch it with most of my friends. I love it anyway.<br />The Bottom Line: I repeat: God has a sense of humor. So do I.

B000002KN8|5.0|Yes, yes...this is not the amazing Gothy, darker Depeche that we all know and love today.  But it IS a perfect set of synth-laden pop tunes that was quite groundbreaking in its day.  Really good songwriting...and it paves the way for the work Vince Clarke would go on to do in Erasure.  If you love the New Wave sound of the early '80s, you've got to get this one.
0393307050|4.0|I had tried to read one of the Aubrey/Maturin books some years ago (because of my interest in the period and the lure of the Jane Austen claims) but couldn't get through it.  I returned to Master and Commander and persevered, and have now gobbled up all 20 of the novels.  I think they are wonderful (and far more complex than the Hornblower books, which I like, but which become rather rote psychologically)--but you do have to become accustomed to O'Brian's fluky rhythm and the almost berserk naval terminology.  (I sometimes suspected that O'Brian was making up particularly convoluted naval terms and laughing at us.)  You might ask, why persist?  Because the novels create an imagined world, intensely interesting and vividly described.  They also become completely gripping in terms of plot--O'Brian frequently leaves an important question dangling at the end of one novel, forcing you to get to the next as quickly as possible.

020530902X|5.0|Few things can make you as self-conscious about your writing as reviewing a book that you feel has improved your writing.  And few things are as silly as terribly written reviews praising such books.  Hopefully, what I learned from this book will lead me to be able to write a review that will convince you to buy it.<br />Many years ago I decided that I wanted to be able to write better, but I didn't really know where to begin.  I'd taken classes, but I was unsatisfied with what I had learned.  I'd learned how to assemble different kinds of essays or papers, but I strongly felt that something was lacking on a more basic level.  My writing lacked, well, style.<br />I happened to ask a professional writer I knew for advice.  I asked him how one could become a better writer.  The answer he gave me seemed completely underwhelming at the time:  \\"Read the Elements of Style twice a month and compare its advice to your writing,\\" he said.  He suggested that I not merely read it once but that I read it continuously, as we all need to be reminded of the guidelines it provides. Writing is a skill that improves with constant practice, much like playing a musical instrument.  Take your writing, apply the lessons and guidelines from this book, and see where you can improve things. While he insisted this was the most important advice I could receive, I remained skeptical.<br />Eventually, I had the good sense to give his advice a shot.  Soon afterwards, I was a published writer.  I still use this book and refer to it regularly.  If you use it regularly in the way my mentor described, it will make you a better writer as well.
0684803356|4.0|This book is simply amazing. Hemmingway is one of the most widely read American authors of the 20th century, with good reason. I found this book to be much better than &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; and &quot;A Farwell to Arms,&quot; both of which are excellent. The final scenes are very, very powerful and the drama he creates from beginning to end is great. As with all great novels, you care about the characters and get involved with the story. I highly recommend this book is anyone who enjoys reading. The only problem with this edition, at least the copy that I have, is that it's full of typos, which is annoying. Regardless, it is well worth reading!

1558908382|2.0|This is a typical Cusak movie. Everything in this movie is to draw attention to him and make him look good. The hip eighties music, the droll but hip sounding conversation, the idea that Mr. Cusak has the skill to kill someone with a... pen, the romance of a sensitive killer going back to reclaim his high school sweethart, and finding meaning in the innocence of a baby's face. Don't fall for this hopeless, romantic &quot;bad-ass.&quot; The premise for the movie simply doesn't work- the &quot;cold-blooded killer has feelings too&quot; theme. Only someone as pretentious and unfunny as Cusak could think like this. Somewhere along the line, the art of good movie making gets lost. That's what happens here and in all Cusak centered movies.

After the women were violated soldiers were encouraged to kill their victims to lessen complications. These murders often occurred in gruesome manners.

It helps the reader get into the mind of not only the victims, but also the killer's mind and the mind of the foreigners looking on. The book also offers explicit detail that at times makes one cry in horror at the events that took place. At times one must put the book down and reflect on how fortunate we are. Real life photographs are provided and create a picture for the gruesome events.<BR> The only thing that I did not enjoy was at times it was too wordy which took away from the impact of the story. What angers me the most is that the Japanese emperor has not provided a formal apology and that even today some officials deny that this ever occurred. How can we learn from our mistakes as a human race if we can't admit that they even happened? I can't understand why the United States did not try their cases with such determination as the Nuremburg Trials. Overall I enjoyed this book because I learned something new and ever since I've read it I've shared this new knowledge with everyone I encounter.
6302787300|4.0|We could clearly see that there were many occurrences that the writers left out in Conquest of Paradise. Here, we see an idealistic version of what occurred after Christopher Columbus discovered the New world. The writers produced a cross-word puzzle that, us, the viewers were able to put together before the climax of the movie developed with intensity. I enjoyed the money greatly, yet I was expecting to se the other side of the Conquest, the horrible side. I wanted the rest of the audience to understand that the results of the conquest was not as pleasant as we have told our children. In Conquest of Paradise Grard Depadieu is portrayed as a hero, or so we are led to think, yet we don't have a chance to see the other version of the story. I was expecting to see how the indigenous culture basically came to be extinct; how their religion was disregarded and Christianity was implemented. We don't see this in this movie; we only see one side of the dilemma.
B00003CWRX|4.0|We all know that it's sometimes worth it to take a second look at a film you may have been dismissive of before.  To say, I didn't &quot;get&quot; THE INSIDER the first time I saw it would be something of an understatement.  I didn't see it as all that revelatory--&quot;'Big tobacco' corrupt?&quot;  &quot;Big media craven?&quot;  &quot;Mike Wallace has an ego and a temper on the scale of  Mt. St. Helens?&quot;  Quelle surprise!  There was nothing particularly new about all that.  In fact, the only big news was that Russell Crowe was going the DeNiro route and altering his physical appearance for the sake of his art.  (OK, OK, not as extreme but he did put on a few pounds and donned a less than flattering grey toupe.) <br />Maybe it was something I ate that first time, though, 'cause the second time around, I have to admit, it was pretty riveting.  This time out, I found the moral dilemmas facing Crowe's whistleblower and Pacino's muckraker TV producer pretty darn fascinating--despite the fact that I knew how it was all going to turn out.  Oh yeah, and I finally got the fact that the title is supposed to be a little ambiguous and that,yes, Pacino's Lowell Bergman character is an &quot;insider&quot; too.  <br />Sometimes I'm a little slow, but eventually, if I'm lucky, I catch on.  THE INSIDER is a quietly powerful and effective film.  Apparently, it didn't manage to convince Russell Crowe to quit smoking, but--as a morality tale and as sheer drama--it's still pretty darn effective.
0060005688|2.0|I was expecting alot more from this book than it provided. That isn't bad, but in an effort to set expectations (which this book advocates) I wanted to write a review to let people know what it does and doesn't do.<br />The Paradox of Choice is a great introductory read if you have never heard of things like Opportunity Costs, Anchoring, Escalation of Commitment, etc. It does a great job of outlining various psychology realities around why choice actually creates more anxiety and depression. If you want to learn about these topics in simple, plain English, this is your book.<br />If you know about these topics already, have taken Psych 101 somewhere, and want to understand best practices of companies and individuals managing choice, this is going to be a disappointment. Of 11 chapters, only 1 was dedicated to how to effectively manage the barrage of choices one is faced with everyday in this society. And that chapter was pretty skimpy on specifics.<br />What I found lacking in this book were specific examples of how individuals effectively handle choice in a positive, proactive way. For example, what is the decision process of a satisficer (a term used in the book) for going to college or buying a car? <br />Furthermore, I would have liked to have seen this author talk about ways we as consumers and businesspeople can influence companies to begin to edit down the number of brands, products, and therefore choices we have to make on a regular basis. <br />Granted, holding this book to such a high standard might just be my desire to see this topic delved into further given the importance of it to our satisfaction with our everyday lives, but I still was expecting more. At least from a hardcover.
B00000ILBK|3.0|For STAR TREK: INSURRECTION (1998), unfortunately famous for Data saying the ultimate cheesy one-liner, &quot;Lock &amp; Load&quot; (*cringe*), Jonathan &quot;Two-Takes&quot; Frakes, back in the director's chair, makes the atmosphere decidedly lighter. That's a good thing; however, after all is said and done in this, the ninth installment in the legendary STAR TREK film saga (and the third one featuring the &quot;Next Generation&quot; cast of characters), there is really not much meat on the bone. In this episode, which begins jarringly with a sudden murderous rampage by a malfunctioning android Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner, in not one of his finer moments as an actor here), the crew of the Enterprise &quot;E&quot; have beamed down to Planet Ba'ku and rather quickly become familiar with the peaceful residents of this planet. This planet is nicknamed &quot;Paradise,&quot; correctly so because it has magical regenerative powers which prevent its people from aging and dying. These people, numbering only 600, are peaceful and seem to have a kind of neo-religious quality to their personalities, as they live in total harmony with nature and openly reject any kind of technology. (This leads to what is probably the best scene in the entire movie, as the Enterprise is revealed to be camouflaged to blend in with the lush surroundings!) <br />Anyway, as Capt. Jean-Luc Picard (the always-wonderful Patrick Stewart) begins to get friendly with one of the eligible female Ba'ku residents, and Commander Will Riker (Frakes) and Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) get friendlier with each other (leading to a surprisingly sensual hot-tub scene), there is trouble brewing in Paradise: an incredibly ugly band of aliens known as the So'na, led by the especially monstrous Ru'afo (F. Murray Abraham), who intends to displace the peace-loving Ba'ku residents and take over the planet for themselves, so as to de-uglify themselves (I'm not making this up). Not only that, but they are givenfull authority to do so by a suspicious Federation admiral (Anthony Zerbe, in his final film role). Because this order clearly violates the Prime Directive (which forbids the interfering of any sovereign planetary civilization), this puts Capt. Picard &amp; crew into a conundrum: do they follow orders like good little Starfleet soldiers or do they uphold the Prime Directive to protect these peacemongers? Put it to you this way: Based on the title alone, plus what you know about the Next Generation characters, what do you THINK they will do??? Duh...Lock &amp; Load!!!<br />Jonathan Frakes had an obviously daunting task: following up the incredible STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT (1996), one of the very best in the entire STAR TREK film saga. STAR TREK: INSURRECTION looks really nice (the visuals are, once again, truly amazing), but alas, there is not really much to care about here. F. Murray Abraham is one of the finest actors of our time, but he must have really needed the money in order to agree to fill a role in which he's not only unrecognizable, but also the recipient of the worst movie makeover in recent big-screen history. STAR TREK: INSURRECTION is certainly not the worst STAR TREK film ever made (that honor would unquestioningly go to the William Shatner-directed misfire STAR TREK V: THE FINAL FRONTIER), but it's definitely not among the best. See it if you're a fan.<br />MODERATELY RECOMMENDED; AGES 10 &amp; UP
B00009V7RF|1.0|Up to this point, Black Eyed Peas were presenting a unique spin on hip-hop and were at the forefront of the alt-rap movement.  However, with their first two albums they were merely at the fringes of the mainstream and clearly were intent on changing that, as evidenced by the Peas licensing their music to advertisers prior to the release of Elephunk.  Enter one Stacy Ferguson (a.k.a. Fergie), a photogenic blonde best known for being a regular on the '80s TV show Kids Incorporated.  Fergie's primary purpose seems to be along the lines of making the Peas more marketable both in appearance and the increased presence of radio-friendly hooks - and from the looks of the album's sales rank nearly a year after its release, apparently it worked.<br />With Elephunk, the Peas have achieved what apparently was their goal all along - they made an unappealing commercial mess of an album that would alienate their old fans and gain new ones by appealing to the lowest common denominator.  Far be it for me to point an accusatory finger at a group or artist for going corporate, but this has to be the most blatant sellout attempt to hit the market since Sugar Ray's 14:59 back in 1999.  Nagging repetitive choruses are married to dunderheaded catch phrases like \\"Let's Get Retarded\\" and \\"Hands Up\\".  It also seems as if the live instrumentation that made the Peas so fresh in the past has taken a bit of a backseat to sequencers here (as in the annoyingly trite and preachy \\"Where Is The Love?\\", featuring the annoyingly nasal Justin Timberlake).<br />Since I mentioned \\"Let's Get Retarded\\" - does anyone else notice the hypocrisy of having a song called \\"Where Is The Love?\\" in addition to having a song that seemingly pokes fun at the mentally challenged?  That is downright offensive, and they apparently are aware of it themselves (as they are releasing it to radio now as \\"Let's Get It Started\\").<br />Speaking of offensive: The Peas have never been among the best wordsmiths in hip-hop, but some of the lyrics here are so weak and cliched that they make you wish that they would \\"Shut Up\\"!  Examples: \\"If it smells like funk, it must be us / The funk funk full foul stinky, it's stanky stuff ... 'Cause we keep it stinky\\" (\\"Smells Like Funk\\"), \\"When you messin' with the funk / You bumpin in your trunk\\" (\\"The Boogie That Be\\" - dumb song title, by the way), \\"Cuban girls, Cuban girls, I like 'em / Puerto Rican girls, Puerto Rican girls, yo quiero...\\" (\\"Latin Girls\\").  I haven't even covered the grating, ubiquitous hit \\"Hey Mama\\", which features an annoying monotone chorus and those irritating post chorus \\"la-la-la-la-la\\" chants - one redeeming thing is that the version of the song on this album is less annoying than the one on the radio.<br />In summary: The Black Eyed Peas might say that this album \\"smells like funk\\", but the truth is that it smells like blatant commercialism - and the Peas were probably smelling cold hard cash when they wrote and recorded this album, since that seems to be the biggest motivating factor at work here.  It's disappointing to see a band that had potential at one time fall apart, but they have done it with Elephunk - thumbs down for me.
B00005O5CM|4.0|Of course this film's plot is preposterous, but LEGALLY BLONDE (2001) is so much fun that you just sit back and go with the flow. Reese Witherspoon completes her long-in-the-making climb up to superstardom with her infectious portrayal of pink-loving, Valley Girl-talking, beauty-minded, hopelessly optomistic, quintessential blonde Elle Woods. Before this role, Reese had co-starred in a string of successful films---PLEASANTVILLE (1998), CRUEL INTENTIONS and ELECTION (both 1999)---but with LEGALLY BLONDE, she has cemented her place in film history. As with Arnold Schwarzenegger The Terminator, Macauley Culkin the Home Alone Kid, Reese Witherspoon will forever be the Legally Blonde Chick.  This is not a bad thing, because Reese is such a talented actress that I do not believe that she will succumb to being typecast. Plus, it sure didn't hurt that she received a whopping $15 million paycheck for LEGALLY BLONDE 2!<br />In this first installment, Elle Woods is a bubblelicious Delta Nu sorority queen and soon-to-be-graduating senior at UCLA looking forward to having her blueblood boyfriend Warner Huntington III (Matthew Davis) propose to her at the beginning. But instead he dumps her for being &quot;too blonde&quot; for him and his high political aspirations. He's going to Harvard Law School; she decides to study hard for the LSATs so that she can follow him to Harvard, show him that she *is* serious, and hopefully win him back. But, alas, once she makes it she learns that he's quickly moved on to another snooty blueblood Vivian Kensington (a well-cast Selma Blair). Of course, she eventually finds a mate of her own, the tall, dark and sensitive Emmett Richmond (Luke Wilson) and with his help, finds her place at Harvard Law, finds herself as an improbably brilliant legal mind, and ends up realizing that Warner's not the guy for her after all. The End. :)<br />Of course, it's not all quite as simple as that. Along the way, she makes good friends with her hairdresser Paulette(Jennifer Coolidge) who has self-esteem (read: men) issues. She even improbably bonds and makes friends with her ex's girlfriend Vivian, who apparently has a sense of humor lurking underneath her b*tch exterior. And the real kicker is that she is asked to work on a criminal case being fought by Professor Callahan (Victor Garber), and ends up winning it for him! (Again, in an improbable but most entertaining way.) <br />Obviously, LEGALLY BLONDE is a chick-flick fantasy and should not be taken as anything else. The reason why it's good is the same reason why *any* good comedy works: it's funny! The screenplay by Karen McCullah Lutz is smart and aware, apparently adapted from Amanda Brown's novel of the same name (didn't know that till recently).  The director, a previously unknown Aussie director named Robert Luketic (who now has scored a second hit with 2004's WIN A DATE WITH TAD HAMILTON!), keeps the pace upbeat. Of course, it helps that he has a good character to work with. Elle Woods is a cross between Cher from CLUELESS (1995) and Pollyanna from the 1960 film of the same name; she has such a glowing positiveness that is so infectious it rubs off on everybody. Even when she's crying over her lost boyfriend, she doesn't stay down for long. Even when she delivers a great comeback put-down line to her main female tormentor, she delivers it with such sunniness that she manages to stay on the high road. Everybody, including her detractors, comes out better for having known her. After watching this film, I feel that way, too. <br />RECOMMENDED, AGES 12 &amp; UP<BR>MOST RECOMMENDED FOR REESE WITHERSPOON FANS---YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE!
B0001XALTG|5.0|For some reason, the 2-disc set released in the states on June 1 features the same artwork as the previous US release - yet all the animated menus still read &quot;Definitive Edition&quot; as in the U.K. release.  Oh well...  For those of us who've been waiting since 1997 for a comprehensive, worthy DVD of Trainspotting will finally get what they've been waiting for.  All nine deleted scenes, commentary, a &quot;making-of&quot; dohicky, and interviews with the cast (as well as Noel Gallagher and Damon Albarn) are included.  Trainspotting fans rejoice at last! One of the best movies of the 90's is finally brought to home video justice.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|My husband and I actually watched this show from the beginning and we were so disappointed when it was cancelled.  This is, by far, our favorite tv show in years.  I just bought this dvd set, and I have to say, it makes so much more sense when you see the episodes in order!  I will never understand what is going on in the minds of the fox execs...I think they must have had a collective lobotomy on the day they decided to cancel.  Buy this set...you will not be sorry.  My only complaint is the lack of a &quot;play all&quot; choice for the episodes.  It's not like you're going to turn it off after just watching one.
B000060P79|1.0|Is because Simple Plan is on tour with MxPx.  I don't know why, but they are, and MxPx is the best.  In fact, MxPx owns Simple Plan, buy Before Everything and After instead of this CD.  The only good song on No Pads No Helmets... is I'd Do Anything.  The rest of the CD is crap.  They whine too much about their parents, kinda like Good Charlotte whines about their dad; but where GC makes up for this with true honest lyrics and killer music Simple Plan just doesn't deliver.  Even when compared to other &quot;Pop&quot; punk bands, or poser bands like Good Charlotte and Newfound Glory Simple Plan can't even match.  Avoid this CD like the plague, buy Before Everything and After by MxPx.
0802130208|2.0|I had heard so much hype about how great this book was -  a \\"bastion of great literature\\" masquerading as a comic masterpiece - so was quite excited to read it.  I ended up finding the book funny....but that's about it.  True, the main character was well-developed and brimming with pathology and the story kept me interested enough, but I was expecting some earth-shattering climax, a heartwrenching denouement....I mean, it did win a Pulitzer after all, no?      The bottom line - the characters were funny (though their personal interactions not as satisfying as I had hoped), the plot moderately entertaining and the ending a little bit of a let down.  I would recommend this if you just wanted a laugh or two, but wouldn't make it your next \\"must read\\".
038533348X|3.0|There is much less humor in this Vonnegut novel than in many of his others.  The characters are also less interesting than those that apppear in his other novels and plays, though there are some that reappear such as the God-guru Bokonon.  I just found this novel kind of wierd, and then the apocalypse was sudden, etc.  There are many of Vonnegut's typical themes:  socially inept people (&quot;losers&quot; in the glitzy American sense) who gain positions of influence/power in obscure places and try to do good, banal science that started out inadvertantly and became very deadly, and speculations about how people should treat eachother.  It is an odd conglomeration.<br />Tepidly recommended.
1592400876|4.0|Here's a small book you'll want to stuff in your pocket for that next flight or train trip to pass the time and avoid the embarrassment of having to explain to people you know that you're chuckling over a book on punctuation. Oddly enough the quite funny joke on which the title is based only appears on the dust jacket. But there is enough deadpan humor, historical trivia, and useful information in this modest work to make up for the lapse. If you think punctuation is just a collection of gratuitous furbelows with strict rules intended to keep grade school teachers, snobs, and compulsive personalities preoccupied, take a deep breath. To be sure our author Lynne Truss is a punctuation vigilante and does not take these matters lightly. Offenses to the language put her into a royal snit. Her temperament inclines to &quot;zero tolerance&quot;, but in practice Truss recognizes the need for flexibility. The written presentation of our language is dynamic and continues to evolve. The preservation of punctuation rather than a fussy observance of rules is her goal. Maybe just maybe that preservation motive explains her regret at not mothering the children of the 16th century Venetian printer, Aldus Manutius the Elder, for whom we have to thank for italics and semicolons.<br />Our present day punctuation began with Greek dramatists providing actors with cues for their onstage delivery. With the development of printing, printers became the innovators for this notational art. Over time conventions developed governing their use and were codified as rules. Creative types bristle at most forms of restraint. Gertrude Stein thought commas to be &quot;servile&quot;, semicolons &quot;pretentious&quot;, and question marks &quot;completely uninteresting&quot;. George Bernard Shaw called apostrophes &quot;uncouth bacilli&quot;. Contrast these punctuation anarchists with 18th century essayist Joseph Robertson who saw the &quot;art&quot; of punctuation to be of &quot;infinite consequence&quot; in writing. In the interent age Truss sees email and text messaging posing a significant threat to punctuation. Writers become &quot;senders&quot; with idiosyncratic phrases (e.g.&quot;CU B4 8&quot;), emoticons (viz. smiley faces), and other hasty expediences. Truss can only shake her head to where this may be leading.<br />Truss makes a serious point simply enough. Punctuation provides the traffic signals that keep words from banging into one another. In a complicated, poetic, and dangerous world punctuation can help render thoughts with clarity. Punctuation is both the sign and the cause of clear thinking. In legal, political, and personal matters this should be remembered. Hmm...maybe it's the neurotics' obsession for detail that keeps us all on track.ot; in writing.

B0001BKAEY|5.0|This is a worthy ending to this series.  While I tired somewhat of the cowboy stuff that naturally accompanies a climax, the dark vision and ambiguous ending of the film mark it as truly outstanding sci-fi.  Sure, the ending was happy, but troubles for the future are very clearly in the making.  The greatest surprize of all is the maintenance of the cryptic - and logically consistent - references that were so much fun in the 2nd part.  Moreover, it is never fully explained, but left to the imaginative to puzzle out, if they so wish.  Indeed, there are added delicious mysteries, like the little Indian girl and the transforamtion of the oracle.<br />REcommended for serious fans of sci-fi.
B0001DI0FI|4.0|Sailing movies of the war genre don't appeal to all people usually. No doubt fans of the \\"Hornblower\\" DVD sets will like this movie. Any fans of classics like \\"Damn the Defiant\\" with Alec Guinness should find it entertaining.<br /><br />Russell Crowe does a fine job of portraying the captain of a British ship in search of the French enemy. His enemy is a worthy quarry and must be tracked to the ends of the Earth. Even when you think the movie is concluded you find it is not. The acting is excellent and they did a fine job of casting.<br /><br />The real treat is the photography and sets. The level of detail is phenomenal. Rarely have I seen such attention to what helps to make a great seafaring movie, a great ship set. The ambiance of sea life is so well preserved you will think you are smelling the sea breeze and feel the salty spray across your face. That or you will feel cramped and smell the sweat and powder below decks as they engage the enemy.<br /><br />The DVDs included in this are first quality and the picture and sound is excellent. It includes numerous extras you can find listed under the details above. All in all this movie was masterfully done.<br /><br />I initially rated this four stars. I would change that to three if I could now. The reason is the more I reflected on this movie I realized I wouldn't be likely to watch it again for some time. What I mean is it does not have a great deal of replayability. The reason is that I wasn't happy with the constant chasing of only one quarry and then even at the end the chase starts all over again. You feel you have been cheated out of a victory and that leaves a hole in the story. At least with the other sea movies I mentioned there is a conclusion, good or bad, it ends and you feel good about it.
1582432678|5.0|I was so blown away by this novel, the minute I finished reading it, I turned to page one to read it again. Eva Khatchadourian is without a doubt the deepest, most three-dimensional character I have ever read. There were many times when I did not agree with what she did, or even particularly like her, but Eva seemed too real to be fictional. The novel is a series of letters written by Eva to her husband Franklin, and they are so brutally honest they may as well be written in blood. I felt like an eavesdropper at Eva's therapy sessions as she recounted the chronology of her marriage to Franklin, then their decision to have a child when Eva is 37 (before time runs out). Eva agonizes over every doubt, every misgiving, every bit of selfishness and negative feelings about being a mother from conception until the present day. With good reason. In the present day, Kevin is in prison for murder, another school shooter. Lionel Shriver creates a compelling, thought-provoking novel which shows that we need not sympathize only with the victims of random violence. This would be a great book for a book club (but the lenghty introspection is definitely not for everyone). I talked about it for hours to whoever would listen, welcoming debates about nature versus nurture, capital punishment, etc.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|To say that this is what one would expect from the next Stonesour album and not Slipknot is shortsighted and dimmwitted.  But, to say that this isnt a massive (in some ways) departure for Slipknot would be equally wrong.  Yes, there are times where it doesnt sound like a nine man army but rather a 5 or 4 peice, this is rare however.  Old Slipknot in full (self title/Iowa) glory can be found in tracks such as \\"The Blister Exists\\". The drums screams and squeeling guitars alone make this song top quality, think \\"Sic\\" meets \\"People = S#it\\".  In the opposite direction is \\"Circle\\" which is nothing like anything from Slipknot.  It is melodic, disturbingly so,especially given the lyrical content.  Slipknot have hinted toward melody in the past. Furious tracks such as \\"Wait and Bleed\\" \\"My Plague\\" and \\"Left Behind\\" are an assault on the senses but had pounding and memeroble choruses where Corey Taylor <gasp> sang.  Was heaviness sacrificed *#@^ NO!  So for once Slipknot went full on melody. Forgive them or not it is a high quality song. \\"Duality\\" is the lead single and rightfully so.  It showcases what this album is all about in a furious swirl of buzzsaw guitars  acrobatic percussion and howl/growl/sing vocals. \\"The Nameless\\" belongs on Iowa, pure and simple. It sounds like a bombardement that should have preceeded \\"The Heretic Anthem\\".<br />My gripes as a Slipnkot fan are few. The turntable and samples sound as marvelous as ever but are in short supply on many of the less lengthy songs.  The turntables helped strengthen songs like \\"Wait and Bleed\\" \\"Disasterpiece\\" and \\"Eyeless\\" if Slipknot dont hang up their masks after this record as many fans fear, then they should put Sid up front a bit. Both turntables and samples can be subtle though. Deftones use theirs atmospherically and it sounds like heavily distorted guitar.  Many of the songs stomp and hammer but they rarely charge with the double bass drum and percussion fury of songs found Iowa.  Depending more on bass and rhythm guitar to give the songs their heft this is a new kind of heavy for fans. Changes that I like: The guitar solos; \\"Opium of the People\\" has a great one. Pure excellence, the occasional neck snapping solo is something Slipknot have always needed.  Using them on this record was very wise. Contrary to the most conservative fans cry of \\"sellout\\", Corey Taylors singing is a brand new weapon for the band as well.  I applaud it, the fact that he can hit the notes he does and still roar just as often is marvelous.  Overall I'm quite happy with my purchase, this album manages to astound me everytime I hear it.  The intricacy, subtle details and nuances in song structure boggle the mind.  Fear not, Slipknot have not made their \\"Load\\" or \\"St. Anger\\" it's not even their \\"Black Album\\", this is something uniquely Slipknot and it is as alive and vicious as ever.<BR>Strongest Tracks: \\"Pulse of the Maggots\\" \\"Duality\\" \\"The Blister Exists\\" \\"Circle\\" and \\"Vermillion\\".
0385512104|4.0|Fifteen year-old Christopher Boone, a high-functioning autistic, is the narrator of this quirky tale. When Christopher finds a neighbor's dog impaled on a garden fork, he decides to solve the mystery of the dog's death. While Christopher does not feel much of an emotional connection to most people (including his own father), he feels that the dog's death is heinous murder. In the course of his investigation, he finds out much more than he bargains for. A really interesting look at the thought processes of the autistic. I found myself laughing to keep from crying at some of the situations Christopher gets himself into, and felt great sympathy for his working-class parents who seem more than a little overwhelmed by Christopher's care.
B000099T2L|1.0|After hearing this in a shop I have to work in anytime they're short of a few people constantly I feel the urge to right down my opinion. I could have claimed blissful ignorance but unfortunately that's been tarnished.<br />First off let's get one thing straight - Crazy In Love was and still is a fantastic pop song - let's make no mistake of that. It was infectious and impossible to resist no matter how much you wanted to hate it - it had charisma ( something lacking in today's charts ). And even if they sampled the hook from somewhere else it was made it's own. <br />Now another song I have an issue with is Naughty Girl....but for all the wrong reasons. She should never have messed with Donna Summer's Love to Love You - the guitars are slowed down a little and it completely wrecks the fun of Love to Love You. And to even sing the line at the start makes it all the more irritating. Still I suppose if Donna Summer gets a few fans because of this then that's alright but it does a disservice to the song<br />The rest of it tends to completely pass by and be meaninglessly bland and no hook that grabs you. Another thing that does happen when you listen is that you can hear that Beyonce really forces herself when she sings. Nothing is natural and she's not at ease with herself which would explain the constant back up she needs on this album. I understand she has a passion for her music but she needs to relax a little. <br />Now someone will probably wonder why I'm doing this review when I heard this in work. The answer is simple - the job basically has me standing around doing nothing waiting for somebody to give me something to do or tell me I have lunch or just tell me to go home! So this is what happens! I've heard the album enough to know what I'm talking about<br />She can sing - I have no doubts about that but a lot of the time she forces herself to do so much that she needs to remember once in a while to relax and let everything take it's own course ( you can workout the rest of the pun for yourself! ). But that's what happens when you have too ambition without any clear view of what it is exactly

On this vhs version the relationship seems more mutual between them then the dvd version!  They had a real heart touching relationship!  I was so glad I got this version of the movie it was so worth it!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I never really got a chance to watch much of this show when it was on air thanks to the horrible scheduling by Fox, but being a moderate Joss Whedon fan, I went out on a whim and bought the DVD, and now I can't stop watching this show. Had it been allowed a decent televised run, I could easily have seen this becoming the best of Whedon's creations. I think that even in its short 14-episode run, it had much more potential for suspense and plot twistage, and the casting was the best I've seen outside of HBO's dramas. I was a little disappointed when the series didn't make it, but now I'm genuinely sad that it's gone.
B0000AQVCL|4.0|Jet is a really great band and I think it's really cool to hear this kind of music come back. 'Get Born' is a really fun CD to listen to and I really enjoy their music. I strongly suggest buying this CD. These guys rock.
0060005688|4.0|I am deeply thankful to live at a time, in a country, where I  enjoy unprecedented freedoms; I would never want someone else to restrict my choices.  And I'm not sure that the author and I agree on this point.<br />However, &quot;The Paradox of Choice&quot; has certainly helped convince me that I could benefit from somewhat limiting my own options in certain areas, as I see fit.  What I liked best about this book is the fact that its last chapter is devoted to giving readers practical, customizeable ways to control the ways in which choice can sometimes be paralyzing.  <br />Worth skimming, at least.
B000002UA5|4.0|How do I review an album like this? There's a live album which I must agree with everyone is awsome. The then new song Careful with that axe Eugeneis the best. Saucerful of Secrets is next on my chart and Astronomy domine is next with Set the Controls For the Hear of the Sun last. It sounds as if Syd Barret is singing AD and it's a bit disapointing. <br />then there's the studio album. What can I say I like it. Roger Water's Grandchester Meadows (Named after the place where David Gilmour was born) is probably the most complete song of all of them. The Narrow Way is the most Floydian sounding of all of them. And Sysyphys (I think that's how you spell it) is Rick Wright's own experimentation and holds up well on it's own. Although most is Just noodling. Nick Mason's &quot;Garden Party&quot; is my least favorite; if only the Narrow Way was at the end so I had a better taste in my mouth at the end. ANyway buy the album for the live piece, Try the studio album but different people have different tastes enjoy... or not
B00008NRI8|1.0|I am very surprised by all the good reviews here for this film.  I sat there waiting for something to happen, but for the entire thing it was just unfunny.  I cared nothing about the characters played by Bullock and Grant.  I went in hoping that it would be the caliber of writing of someone like Richard Curtis on Notting Hill or Love Actually (two terrific Hugh Grant films), but this was just a complete waste of time where you want those hours of your life back.  I noticed Bullock's name as a producer.  I hope this doesn't mean she fudged with the script to make it &quot;funny&quot; in her mind.  (Anybody remember when actress Kim Basinger complained that the writer of the script for her film Marrying Man had no conception of comedy and she decided to rewrite it?  The writer she was complaining about was Neil Simon.)
B0001ENYKS|5.0|Unfortunately, these guys don't sound anything like the Gang of Four, Joy Division, Echo and the Bunnymen, The Cure or any other band who's name gets inexplicably dropped when some durn young 'un goes to review a fun new band.  Truth be told, Franz Ferdinand is no more than an extremely tight, groovy disco combo.  This is not to undersell them.  Alexander Kapranos has a warm, deep voice with just the right amount of strain and vibrato.  The lyrics are appropriately minimal and esoteric, primarily serving the purpose of driving the rhythm and the atmosphere, occasionally breaking to let rays of humor and narrative shine through (particularly on the brilliant &quot;Dark Of The Matinee&quot;.  The guitar tones are surprisingly complex and unique, given the band's dancefloor pedigree, and the riffs are cripplingly catchy.  And the bass!   This is a bass player who knows EXACTLY how to serve a song...when to play, what to play, how to play it....and what's more, what to add to make a song memorable.   Considering how many bass players these days are content to melt into the backdrop of a song, this is a welcome change.   Bottom line, if you like The Electric Six, The Rapture, Junior Senior, Radio 4, !!!,  LCD Soundsystem etc. etc. etc....or, more simply, if you're on the lookout for an album you can leave in your car stereo,  check out Franz Ferdinand.
078322799X|5.0|Frank Bannister (Michael J. Fox) had pretty much given up on life since his wife died in a freak car accident.  He was an up and coming architect before the wreak, but ever since he watched his wife die before his eyes, whispers have followed him around town that he murdered her in cold blood.  Frank's erratic behavior since the car accident don't help matters any and its not like most people believe that he can really see ghosts, even though he can.  Something about being so close to death opened his eyes and Frank found himself a new line of work as a kind of ghost buster.  Frank supposedly gets rid of poltergeists and haunting ghosts, but he really sends his three friends, The Judge (John Astin), the afro sporting, disco wearing Cyrus (Chi McBride) and the nerdy Stuart (Jim Fyfe), all of whom happen to be dead, into homes to terrorize innocent people until they pay his outrageous fees.  Frank made a pretty good living from it, too, except people have starting dying from freak heart attacks all over town - and Frank can see numbers engraved in their foreheads.  Numbers that show Frank who will be taken next...<br />As Frank struggles to save the people marked for death, he finds himself falling in love with Dr. Lucy Lynskey (Trini Alvarado), a very recent widow whose husband was killed by whatever thing is stalking the town.  But Lucy has her own problems to deal with as she tries to help the reclusive Patricia Ann Bradley (Dee Wallace-Stone), who lives in an old Gothic mansion on the edge of town with her crazy mother (Julianna McCarthy).  Lucy is convinced that Patricia is being abused and wants to help her, but she doesn't quite know how.  What Frank and Lucy don't know is that all of their problems stem from one event - serial killer Johnny Bartlett's (Jake Busey) killing spree at a local mental hospital.  It was never proved that Patricia was involved in the deaths of so many people, but it was never disproved either.  She was Johnny's girlfriend and has never been what you would call normal.  Johnny was caught, condemned and executed shortly after his killing spree, but his spirit has come back to haunt everyone and he was determined to kill more people than any other serial killer in American history...<br />The Frighteners was one of those rare movies that made you laugh as it scared the heck out of you.  With great special effects and a wonderful score, you never know what may pop out at you and I found myself jumping often.  The cast was marvelous with Michael J. Fox leading the way as a smarmy con-man who is out to make a quick buck.  Amazingly, you find yourself really caring for him and rooting him on in his weird romance with Trini Alvardo (who could be Andie McDowell's twin, I swear), a sweet, but not shy woman who makes Michael's character work for her.  The trio of ghosts were hilarious, as was FBI Agent Milton Dammers (Jeffrey Combs), who is convinced that Frank killed all of those people.  Agent Dammers had some serious issues to work with, which made him relatively easy to manipulate, which was a joy to watch.  Jake Busey and Dee Wallace-Stone were perfectly cast and really creeped me out.  I could definitely believe that they were serial killers who were completely insane.  Once again we see Peter Jackson's directing brilliance in this very entertaining film.  As always, he has creative camera views, eye-popping effects and little surprises around every corner.

B00008H2LB|1.0|**BREAKING NEWS** The album &quot;Meteora&quot; by Linkin Park is causing goths to kill themselves. Seriously though, do kids see the t-shirt and Hot Topic and rush out to buy the album then goto Amazon and give it a rave review before then even listen to it? <BR>Anyway onward to the actual album, This album is so horrible just a bunch of angry songs for kids who didn't make the team in high school, which is fine it helps them &quot;vent&quot; (not that making the football team is a big deal but oh well you can't get laid if you don't). But they take it too far and kill themselves during their friendly listen to Linkin Park because they saw a Hot Topic shirt that reccommended it. This album is horrible avoid it at all costs.
B0000DBJDM|5.0|Wow. Some may say Pink Floyd's albums were self indulgent. Some may say Pink Floyd's live shows were self indulgent. Look no further - here is one of the most self indulgent pieces of film/music you will ever see in your life. This is crazy! The band sitting around the ruins of Pompeii, twiddling with fuzz boxes. <br />But this is great cinema, great viewing. For all the acid munching wastrels that enjoy Pink Floyd so much, buy this.
0385336810|4.0|This is a very funny book, especially the dialogue. I chuckled out loud a few times. I love flawed wacky main characters, like the one in this story. Easy to follow storyline, and very fun to read how Emma basically spills her fib-telling guts out to this guy she doesn't know . . . and he ends up being her boss! Oh-oh, will these many little lies get her in deep trouble and end badly? or will we have the happy storybook ending? You'll see :)<br />David Rehak<BR>author of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;
B00028HBKM|5.0|I've read some people here say why couldn't they show the good things Jesus did, his teachings, etc... well that's not the POINT of this movie! Mel Gibson has stated the movies purpose is to focus on the last 12 hours of Jesus' life. I think the movie is very well done. There is a passage in the Bible that says Jesus was beaten beyond recognition, so I think this was depicted very well in the movie.<br />If you want a movie on Jesus' life and be able to see all the good things he did, his teachings, and not just his suffering then I suggest you get Jesus of Nazareth starring Robert Powell, it is by far the best depiction of Jesus' life that exists, but TPoTC is one of the best movies based on a section of the Bible that I have ever saw and I can't wait until it is released on August 31st!!!
B00020HEL6|5.0|Wow. <br />I purchased this CD on Apple's iTunes.  I then learned by viewing the information about the CD on Amazon.com that Ms. Olstead is only 14 years old.  I had no idea.  Geez.  14 years old.  Wow.  This girl is very, very talented.  I know.  Talent.  Talent.  Talent.  Thank you Mr. Foster!
B000002J1M|5.0|I first heard the key cuts (Suppers Ready, Watcher) on my local AOR station back in '77...and was just ...well... shocked, stunned,<BR>moved. I'd hear the occasional cut on the radio over the years, and even saw import vinyls - at exhorbitant prices - at a few select record shops. I would sate my Genesis jones with the Lamb...but it was Foxtrot for which I yearned.<br />Some complain about the mix on the album, but there's a story there, and we have to follow the thread. Now I have the CD, some 25 years(!) later, and only drag it out on those occasions when I know I can crank loud, get up and dance, shed tears, and laugh in joy without being considered for commitment.<br />Just buy it.
B00005S6K8|2.0|The original Sabrina was a classic, with three of the greatest stars of all time -- Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart and William Holden -- being directed by Billy Wilder, one of the greatest directors of all time. To be sure, the producers of this remake did their best to duplicate the magic of the first film. It's directed by the great Sydney Pollack and stars Harrison Ford, Greg Kinnear, Nancy Marchand, John Wood, Richard Crenna, Angie Dickinson and Lauren Holly. In one way, the film is better for the casting of Harrison Ford in place of Humphrey Bogart. Ford probably wasn't much younger than Bogart was when he made his version. But Bogart seemed older than the 54 he was when the original was made. Ford, in contrast, seems much more youthful ( even with Linus Larabee's stuffy persona) and more of a natural match for Sabrina.<br />However, all of these quality elements are negated by the casting of Julia Ormond as Sabrina Fairchild. To be sure, Ormond is a beautiful woman. However, she has the charisma of a pile of wet toilet paper. She has absolutely none of the allure of her predecessor in the role and comes off very, very badly because of it. I know it's unfair to compare most actresses with the irreplaceable Audrey Hepburn, but this, after all, is the role she created, so she is being held to a higher standard. I knew there was a problem with the movie when I found myself more attracted to Lauren Holly as Greg Kinnear's jilted fiancee than Julia Ormond as the lead. Because of this bad casting, the film just falls flat and pales in comparison to the original. Too bad.
B0000X2EOW|4.0|This is a very good movie for fantasy lovers. It's great for children and adults.<BR>The movie isn't just about magic. It's more about growing up and putting behind childhood dreams. No mater how painful that is.
B000002UDB|5.0|First of all, Magical Mistery Tour was originally a double EP (Extended Play), that was released in Britain in late 1967, and contained the songs Magical Mistery Tour, Fool on the hill, Flying, Blue jay way, Your mother should know, and I am the walrus. Since the American market wasn't too sure about this EP format, Capitol decided to put all the new Beatles songs on the A side of an LP format, and all the other output from the group released in 1967, (except for Sgt.Pepper, that is) on the B side. It wasn't a bad idea after all, because this &quot;album&quot; works really well. When all Beatles CDs were released in the 80's, EMI decided to put this album on CD, following the American idea.<br />There are great songs in it, like, Fool on the Hill, the enigmatic Blue Jay Way, enjoyable numbers like Your Mother Should Know, and of course, the glorious I Am The Walrus.<br />Other memorable tracks are Straberry Fields Forever, Penny Lane, Hello Goodbye, and All You Need Is Love.<br />Too many good songs to be true...<br />I'm sure you're gonna enjoy this CD very much and is an example of the great talent of The Beatles as songwriters and musicians, not forgetting the input by George Martin, of course. His work on orchestral arrengements for songs like Strawberry Fields, Blue Jay Way and I Am The Walrus are truly breathtaking.<br />All in all a great CD, Classic, Legend, a Must... The Beatles.<br />What more can I say ?
B000002WNP|5.0|This is a great set for any Elvis fan. If your a new fan or have loved him for years.<BR>It has so much to offer besides his music. I really recommend it because you get hours of joy from it.
B000001TVD|5.0|Well George Clinton/Parliment/Funkadelic/P-Funk/Parliment Funkadelic/P-Funk Allstars/whatever else I forgot have made much music under many different names, most of which I listed above. By the mid seventies Parliment Funkadelic was turing into a pure disco funk group and it wasn't a bad thing, but was what they had before a  better thing? I contend that it was. In order to see what the roots of songs like Atomic Dog and One Nation Under the Groove are just listen to this album and you will be thoroughly confused yet somewhat enlightened. <BR>This album is a showcase of the guitar virtuosity that was present in the P-Funk. The guitar work on many of the tracks especially Maggot Brain is simply amazing; transcending most of the words that I am saying. It is literally the kind of sound that you must hear to beleive. It sounds like the guitar work that Joe Satriani and Stever Vai played in the 80s but unlike those two guitarists the guitar work on this album sounds freash and original. <br />Furthermore this is not a dance album like much of the band's later material. Do not expect to be able to pop this cd into the player and get a floor full of people dancing. It is barely dance music on most of the songs, instead it is predominatly instrumental weird spacey rock. I would assume that this album definately fits into the category of music which you get high to.<BR>Also the song arrangements are simply ingenious. Each song has a very clear buildup and never gets really boring. Unlike much of today's instrumental music this is anything but background music. <BR>As you could probably see there are few albums that I could recommend more highly than this. Even if you are a fan of George Clinton's dance music buy this album to see the roots of the group and of the legend.

B00008J4P5|4.0|I fell in love with &quot;White Blood Cells&quot; in a way that I didn't fall in love with this album.  It's a good album but it's not a GREAT album.  I suggest that you go out and buy it, listen to it and then put it away for a while and then listen to it again.  This is an album that you don't want to get tired of.  If you listen to this album over and over again you will learn to hate this band.  I personally really love this band but this album is just another white stripes record.  Nothing really special.  Seven Nation Army was a bit of change but not too much.  The sound is cleaned up a little but that's only because they have more money to spend on production.  I think that the white stripes have a masterpiece waiting inside of them but this is not it.  I like this record but I don't love it.  But I do love the white stripes.  Does any of this make sense?

B00008BLAS|3.0|Many tracks here sound like they were recorded in an empty club with house mikes instead of any line outs on the amps. Like when you're watching the news and there's a story about a festival and the reporter's on camera with the band booming and echoing in the background? Well, some of these tracks sound like footage shot by the cameraman without the reporter. There's fairly decent bottom, but that can be boosted in the final mixdown. One point of interest is that there are three tracks Mark Farner didn't participate in the writing of. The most obvious is the single release \\"Loco-Motion\\" (written by Carole King when she was a teenager). But \\"Carry Me Through\\" and \\"Gettin' Over You\\" are written by drummer Don Brewer and keyboardist Craig Frost. I think it's Brewer singing lead on these--he's soloed before, beginning back in the \\"Closer To Home\\" days when he swapped lines with Farner in the bridge section of \\"Hooked On Love\\". I thought \\"Little Johnny Hooker\\" would turn out to be some sort of nod to blues legend John Lee Hooker, which would be the first time this blues-influenced band has done that, but instead it deals with a kid bullied in school and getting sent up the river because he replied with a switchblade. If there's a message here about there being a certain injustice in getting busted for a fight you didn't start, it's too elusive to hang your hat on. Maybe the 3-D cover art, plus the presence of an early-1960s classic, was a warning that this album would have a cheesy retro 1950s/ 1960s blare in the recording quality, I don't know.

B00012FXB8|4.0|Sure, I never liked the theatrical version of Alien 3 very much. Not because they radically changed the feel or killed of Hicks and Newt. More because it seemed quite disjointed and you never felt too connected with the convicts and they just became a buch of running, screaming bald Englishmen.<br />Well after watching the extended version I think this movie absolutely shines. You get so much more charcter development in the convicts and a lot more of a sense of what kind of a little society they have made for themselves and it makes their attempts at dealing with the Alien much more poignant and meaningful. There are parts that are radically different which I can't believe they cut out.  <br />This is well worth owning to get the extended version but at least rent it, as for all Alien fans who felt let down by this movie, this is a great showing of redemption for an unfulfilled chapter in a faltering franchise.<br />....I wish Alien Ressurection could have been saved the same way but that patient was flatline straight from the field.......
B0001XAPY2|5.0|So, it's finally going to happen. Here's hoping that the people at Disney do the original version some justice..... by leaving it alone!! My family and I have watched a bootleg copy that was given to us of this film on DVD for the last couple of years. While the subtitles are sometimes a bit hasty posted to read, repeated viewings have helped to make this a very enjoyable film. It has also slowly become a sort of cult favorite with us. The ending is particularly poignant. As a guy with a soft spot for genuine romance and a passion for adventures, particularly those involving older aircraft, this film really leaves it's mark. My entire family look forward, eagerly to seeing the new release for American audiences.Also, comparing this film to other films by this director and storyteller is silly. Miyazaki is a versitile creator, capable of involving many types of storytelling and animation techniques and story pacing to tell a wide variety of stories on film. For those who think this is a kids film, it is not, no more than Casablanca is a kids film. They can watch it and probably will enjoy it but this is not \\"My Neighbor Totoro\\" or \\"Kiki's Delivery Service\\". Comparing it to them is not relevant regarding the story's content or the animation. Do people let their little ones watch \\"Princess Mononoke\\" because it's an animated feature? I certainly hope not. \\"....Mononoke\\" deserved it's PG-13 rating and \\"Porko Rosso\\" deserves it's PG rating for reasons regarding content.
B0001BKAEY|4.0|The Matrix Revolutions is the third and final part of the Matrix trilogy and more the second part of the Matrix II. This time there is less fighting martial art style but more SF fighting between machines. It all looks superb again of course. In the second movie you could sometimes see that the characters fighting were computer graphics instead of real people but not so now, making it looking more real; even for a SF. <br />We finally see the end of the story, but like in all the Matrix movies, makes us think again too. Does it start all over again? or not? <br />You have to see this if you have seen the first two and are interested in the story, you will not be dissappointed!
B000096FUD|3.0|This documentary about Terry Gilliam's attempt to make a film about Don Quioxte is facinating.  Seeing the disasters that are thrown in front of this film can be hard to watch at times.  One definiitely feels sorry for the cast and crew.  What was most interesting to me is to see how little Gilliam had to work with after having his film budget cut drastically.  From location, to equipment, to actors who had agreed to work for a fraction of their normal salaries - the documentary not only chronicles a disaterous attempt to make a film, but also captures the struggles that any director has while working on a budget.  Worth seeing if you have any intellectual interest in the film making process.
0316168815|5.0|I'd heard of this book over the past year, but always passed it up as I didn't know the premise (and found the title unusual).<BR>I hate that I waited to so long. Ms. Sebold did a wonderful job as narrator through 14 yr old Susie, who has to rely on those still on Earth to show her what growth and growing up encompass. A very unique perspective that hold the reader's attention even through the scene changes. I highly recommend this novel for it really makes you think of your time here and how we are affected by those that are gone, but not forgotten.
B00005R62K|5.0|before priest reducded the length of their songs in the early 80s with albums like british steel and screaming for vengeance they were a rather different beast with much longer songs. out of the pre-british steel albums stained class is problaly the best. songs like exciter, better by you better by me and the peerless beyond the realms of death are the ackownledged classics on the album. however the other tracks like the title track, invader and savage are equally as good. the impact of this album upon thrash can not be underestimated just listen to exciter if you don't believe me. a brillant album and well worth getting.

Now I have all her CDs, she just has that voice that no one can beat. She is a complete Diva.
B00008XEP5|5.0|Before Metallica came to be, there was Diamond Head. And the album LIGHTNING TO THE NATIONS was the one that started it all. Diamond  Head were one of the esteemed NWOBHM bands in the late 70s-early 80s that were influential in the heavy metal genre. <br />LIGHTNING TO THE NATIONS featured great songs such as the title track, &quot;Sucking My Love&quot;, &quot;Helpless&quot;, &amp; the classic &quot;Am I Evil?&quot; that Metallica covered in their GARAGE DAYS, Inc. <br />Every metal fan MUST have this album.
B0001Z53AQ|3.0|I'll have to be honest i was expecting better. I thaught d-12 would explode but the cd wasnt as good as i expected. Eminems parts killed though, he did a great job. All of the songs are ok but there arent any that really strike you. I still recomend a buy for this cd because it is still a good buy if you like eminem and d-12.
B000002GK1|5.0|BADMOTORFINGER simply ranks as one of the greatest heavy metal releases in the 90s. There are really no words for me to describe how great this album. Soundgarden combines the rawness of vintage 70s metal &amp; adds their own unique touch to make this album an undisputed classic. Chris Cornell has never sounded better in this album. Shades of early Budgie &amp; Sabbath influences are apparent in this album.<br />BADMOTORFINGER is indeed a classic in the metal genre. PERIOD!
B000069CWE|5.0|I love all the linkin park CD's, even this one. This CD gets bad reviews because of the rockers that hate rap. This CD takes all the linkin park songs from the first album and puts a rap twist on them. As a fan of rock and rrap i loved this CD. Sorry to all you rap haters who opposed it.
B000002KB8|5.0|BALCK SABBATH, the album started the legacy of one of heavy metal's legendary bands, Black Sabbath. I remember listening to this album for the first time. The title track scared the living hell out of me. BLACK SABBATH is the complete antithesis of the free love &amp; hippie movement that was going on in the late 60s-early 70s. No one has ever played this heavy at that time. Led Zeppelin laid the groundwork of heavy metal, but Sabbath put the EVIL touch of darkness that would be synonymous with heavy metal in the years to come.<br />Ozzy Osbourne was never a great vocalist, but his vocals were perfect for the music that Black Sabbath played. What he lacked in technical ability as a singer, he made up for it in attitude. Tony Iommi's guitar would send chills down your spine particularly in the song &quot;A Bit of Finger&quot;. It's as if the gates of hell was opened &amp; a scream from hell emananted from the very depths of hell itself. Geezer Butler's bass is superb &amp; influential.<br />You wanna start out listening to Sabbath, this is the perfect album to start out.
0151008116|5.0|I read non-fiction almost exclusively so it took a bit to get me to start this book.  Once I started, I enjoyed it cover to cover. It's really a very good philosophy book richly packaged in a very interesting novel.  I pleasured at pondering the ideas presented while enjoying the story.  There are points that would be too harsh for children but would be a great book for older kids (over 14?).<br />I believe it's a must-read.  The ideas are always gently presented, never preachy, always thought provoking.  Very, very entertaining.  And, it's fiction that one can learn from---that's a bonus!<br />Get the hardcover, you'll want to make this a family &quot;keeper&quot;.
B0000C9JFO|5.0|I don't agree with the reviewers who say this film is frivolous or not 'deep.' It certainly is meaningful for me.  I have studied abroad twice-a summer in Costa Rica and a semester in Mexico--and the experiences of Xavier really struck a chord with me--I lived so many of the things he does in the film. It's about self-discovery, feeling stuck between two cultures, and learning about life.  Xavier's return to Paris after a year in Barcelona reminded me of my experience with readjustment to life in the U.S.  It was a big let down, and I felt like no one really understood--exactly what happens to Xavier.  It's a very funny movie, capturing all the wonderful experiences and life lessons that we can only have by living abroad....I highly recommend this film.
B0000DZ3HM|5.0|Este disco, que reinaugura el repertorio del hardbop en la escena del jazz en los ochenta, es uuna pel&iacute;cula imprescindible para entender la evoluci&oacute;n del jazz desde los sesenta a la fecha. A la constelaci&oacute;n de grandes estrellas como Herbie Hancock, Artt Blakey, Freddie Hubbard, Ron Carter, Joe Henderson, verdaderos jazz messengers despu&eacute;s del bebop, se unen con asombrosa personalidad los new lions como Michel Petruciani o Stanley Jordan. Casi 2 horas de placer absoluto, la mejor m&uacute;sica, los mejores temas, improvisaci&oacute;n a la altura del siglo.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|This album simply rocks!<BR>It is more mature from let go(although it was good too)and the lyrics and music are more much better.
B0001XWV0S|5.0|Although I can't say that this movie had all that of original plot (its kind of like Road Trip mixed with National Lampoon's European Vacation) it was definately funny.  Four friends, Scott, Cooper and the twins Jenny and Jamie travel Europe bound for Berlin to find Scott's hot penpal Micah.  During their trek they run into a bunch of soccer hooligans, get groped by an Italian train passenger, experiment with a number of substances, and have some unholy affairs in the Vatican.<br />Overall, this movie makes the viewer laugh at the expense of European stereotypes.  If you are a fan of the American Pie movies or those of the party-sex movies (Animal House, Porky, Road Trip, etc.) then I would recommend giving this movie a glance.  If you liked Road Trip, I think that you will find Eurotrip even funnier.  Like most \\"unrated\\" DVDs that I have seen I can't saw that the unrated quality adds much to the movie.  In terms of female nudity, breasts are numerous (as is expected of these kinds of movies) but there is a little more male nudity than one might expect.  If you watch this movie, definately make sure to check out the extra features. Unlike most deleted scence, some of the deleted scenes in this movies are as funny as scenes that made the cut.
068485743X|4.0|Perhaps I'm not really ready for this book yet, as I am only around 10,000 words into my first serious novel, however I bought this book because I am very interested in ship shaping up my manuscript for when I am ready to try and get published.<br />I have to say that I thought this book gave practical, if not obvious advice. Perhaps I say that because the final chapters are more fresh in my mind, and these were more about what you were writing about. The chapters I am talking about are like &quot;viewpoint&quot;, &quot;hooks&quot;, etc. Such things I think I am already good at, however I guess it is wise to check for these things in the editing stage!<br />The more helpful chapters for me were in part one and two.<br />Part one just simply stressed the importance of having a nice, fresh manuscript with correct font, line spacing etc. then it went on about the way you write, such things as &quot;style&quot;, &quot;sound&quot; and &quot;adverbs&quot;, things that I'm not sure if I am doing, so when I go back to edit I will be looking out for these things.<br />The second part was about dialogue. I found this helpful because sometimes I am not sure if I am using too much dialogue or not. &quot;common place&quot; speach, &quot;imformative&quot; and &quot;hard to follow&quot; were some of the issues raised.<br />I have not done any of the exercises that are present at the end of the chapters, but they are there for those who like to do these kinds of things.<br />My only gripe was reading through the examples. Some of the examples were rather dull. Maybe that was the point, but it would have been nice to have good writing as an example with the &quot;bad&quot; writing in it. It was just not the most readable thing, and I found myself skipping though them.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Normally I tend to shy away from overly popular music because so many of the most wildly successful musicians  tend to have more style than substance so I dug in my heels and wasn't going to be sucked into buying Nora's CD just because of her boatload of music awards.<br /><br />But due to her success, her music became inescapable and could be heard at supermarkets, drug stores or in films like Two Weeks Notice.  I became intrigued by the sound of her  voice and took a chance and bought her CD and was richly rewarded by the gamble.  Nora's CD has now earned a permanent place in my 5 disc CD player.<br /><br />Nora has the voice and talent to became a worthy heir to the greatest of female jazz greats (Holiday, Fitzgerald, Simone, Horn etc) and amply establishes her credentials with this CD.  Nora could make a living just by mining the jazz songbooks of Gershwin, Porter, and others by putting her own interpretation of those works as she does with Carmichael's song on this CD.<br /><br />Nora's sultry, smoky voice is perfect for those of us who thrill to the imperfect, vulnerable sound of Billie Holiday and I'd love to see her talent focused on producing masterpieces of female vocal jazz rather than diverting her talent and energies on country music.  Faith Hill and Shania Twain can fill the void in this area.<br /><br />Nora has the talent to become one of the jazz greats and I hope she continues to devote her efforts in this area.
B0001XTIUO|5.0|...is a joy forever.  Linda Perhac's voice is pure and true; this album is a long-lost treasure from the sixties and yet, like the work of Nick Drake, the songs are both timeless and contemporary.  &quot;Hey Who Really Cares&quot; is one of the most poignant and moving tracks I have ever heard; and is just crying out to be included in an important mainstream movie soundtrack.  Inventive harmonies, spiralling guitars, trippy touches, and above all written from a woman's point of view, light some candles and allow Linda's pitch perfect voice to enfold you.  Linda, if you're reading this, please please record some more music as the world is a lesser place without your talent.
014017821X|4.0|I'm writing this because I don't want the fool in line behind me to have the last word.<br />I know nothing about the factual aspects of Carter's life and could care less- I'm in it for the stories, the tales, the language. These are excellent reworkings of classic stories, boldy reworked to highlight and examine the feminine elements at play in the tale. I'm not gonna get all lit jargony on your ass. The stories themselves are taut, well-paced, superbly detailed and all atound marvelous to read (though the first one- the reworking of the Bluebeard story- is my least favorite).<br />These stories inspired me to attempt my own reworkings of various tales. I'm not soliciting here- I'm just demonstrating that this book is an inspiring little collection of polished gems. Reasonably priced too.<br />Also, as a final tempt- If you know a young woman who is imaginative and literary minded, and you want to reinforce those qulaities (quite  task in this day and age) you should get her this. It will be a step up from Anne Rice novels and the lyric sheets to those Cure CDs.<br />Pick up 'The Sadean Woman,' too. It's an interesting feminist appraisal of the infamous Marquis and an illuminating read.
B0001UL7RY|2.0|Simply put this CD made me want to puke, it reminded me of all those hippies sitting around a campfire and singing songs about love.  Maybe record companies should look into actually producing good music instead of crying about how music sales have fallen.
B000002MP2|5.0|This is the best CD I have so far. It's really fun and exciting and the music just takes you away. I would have you guessing about the bonus track but Amazon and these other fun riuners gave it away, the volcals suck on the bonus track anyway, and they say it's not worth the wait but you can fastforward the CD to it (read your CD player manual about that). MY favorite tracks are Welcome to paradise, When I come around and longview. Overall, this CD is a very good buy.
0671027387|1.0|Dan Brown's &quot;Deception Point&quot;  seems eerily similar to &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;.  The characters are the same, the plot is basically the same, and the twists are the same.  There are only so many times you can feint with your right and follow with a left hook for a knockout before everyone in the world sees it coming 3 rounds earlier.  Dan Brown needs new characters, new plot, and new ideas.  Another good analogy for this book is Tom CLancy light:  same great taste without the substance!
0345404475|5.0|It is a futuristic story, set in a distopian society where, since the fallout of world war III, humanity has managed to set off to colonize other planets. The main plot of the book is that a bounty hunter (Rick Deckard) is searching for rogue androids who have made their way back from the colony on Mars after killing their owners. Pretty cut and dry - in fact, the movie Blade Runner was based on the book. But as far as science fiction, this is where the story departs - using the future as merely a background for commentary on the meaning of existence, the possibility of overt manipulation of the psyche due to outside sources, and the omnipresent oppression &quot;the power&quot; has over everyone. A very good read, if for nothing more the commentary on what separates us from robots. Definitely a book I highly recommend.
0671027344|5.0|Being the avid reader i am, i am very paticular about the books i choose. I must say this is one of the better books that ive picked up. It focous's on Charlie, a 14 or 15 year old boy who, to begin with, just isnt very social. He is introduced some people from school and is thrown in the life of fast driving, good music, mix tapes, gay parks, and weed brownies. The book, written in entry/letter form, is easy to follow and easy to relate to. Id say that the age groups to read this book is 7th-11th grade. The fun and yet sensitive book is a must have for any teenager.
B00006ZCFH|5.0|I first heard this CD at a friend's house one afternoon and RAN out to buy it that very same day. This is hands down my favorite CD this year.  It's not often I find an album I can listen to over and over again from beginning to end.  EVERY SINGLE TRACK IS HOT!  <br />The intro draws you in with it's silky sexiness and comes to a crescendo after which Miss Erykah invites you to \\"Bump It\\" (which I advise you to do....this CD is meant to be played luxuriously loud).  You then take a trip to \\"Back in the Day\\" where you are instantly seduced by a track that makes you feel like you're at a basement house party groovin' and puffin' to a Patrice \\"Rushinesque\\" rhythym.  Just when you think it can't get any better, she takes you into a 10 minute rhythmically sensual journey on \\"I Want You\\".  I particularly like the drum line on this...reminiscent of the Womack & Womack club hit \\"Baby I'm Scared of You\\".  Very sexy.  After you've climaxed you bask in the afterglow with \\"Woo\\", a fun piece that was developed after she improv'd it onstage at a concert.  Next, she gets conscious with Dead Prez on \\"the Grind\\"...a funky inner-city message piece.  She keeps it grimey with \\"Danger\\"...a fabulously funky track that demands to be played at full bass.  She gets smoother with \\"Think Twice\\" and there is a SUPERB appearance by Roy Hargrove on this track. Next, she takes you back to the party with \\"Love of My Life Worldwide\\" with a wonderful cast of guest vocals including Queen Latifah, fellow neo-soulite Angie Stone, and Mohammadia.  She then gradually fades you out of her world with the same sexy outro that she brought you in with.  Truly full circle.  If you are a soul flower like me...a child of the 70's & 80's you will LOVE this CD.  This is GOOD MUSIC and stands out in a sea of mediocrity.  Thank you Erykah for staying true to your soul roots!
B0000C9JFO|4.0|Xavier (Romain Duris) comes to Barcelona as an exchange student and his life changes. He is in this apartment with 6 other students who have varied interest and view points. Even though the cover shows Audrey Tautou but she only plays a small role in this movie. This movie is all about Romain Duris.<br />The movie is captivating and photography is excellent. It shows the years of adolescence when we are al confused and searching between Che and Kennedy to find our heroes. Highly enjoyable movie.
B0000CAXID|3.0|The debut effort of the Foo Fighters lacks the sophistication of later efforts, but you definitely get an idea that this band is going to work. A driving rhythm section propels most of the songs, and while this makes them catch your attention, the vocals are buried.. The softer songs like \\"Big Me,\\" make an effort to break through the constant pounding, but come off as a bit of an afterthought.  Later works show more sophistication, but you will definitely see the seeds for that success planted here.
B00000272N|5.0|Years ago, MTV played &quot;Man in the Box&quot; on Headbanger's Ball and I was intrigued enough to purchase this cassette.  Wow!  Talk about blown away.  While &quot;Man in the Box&quot; is very strong, the rest of the album is just as good.  If you like this group, you'll understand the perfect combination of powerful metal and harmony (with Layne Staley's unique voice). This is definitely heavier than their later productions (Jar of Flies, SAP).  And, for that reason mainly, it is also their BEST.
B000002KDM|3.0|I love this album, but I admit I'm more of a James Taylor fan than most. If you're used to the greatest hits, than this might not be for you. It's not the stuff you hear on the adult contemporary stations, instead, it's a little more personal, and a lot more emotional. Is it a bad album? Certainly not, is it typical James Taylor? Absolutely. I'm sure most artists would agree that quite often, the &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; aren't always the best an artist has to offer, or even indicative for that matter. They're hand picked snippits thrown together for the masses. That phenomenon is apparent in this case.  So I say to you, if you don't like this album, because it's not like the greatest hits; Perhaps you should try &quot;Greatest Hits Volume II&quot; It lives up to the former collections standards
B000002JSR|4.0|Coda is amazing for what it is, which is a collection of rejected songs to fulfil a contract, However the fact that these songs were rejected from albums like Untitled should not mean they are thought of as crap, We're Gonna Groove is often the first thing I listen to (before stairway to heaven), the album is also supported by songs like Ozone Baby, Poor Tom and Darlene as well as the live version of I can't quit you babe (this exact version is found on the first disk of the newly released DVD) all of which sound incredible, as well as Bonzo's Montreux which, as a drummer myself, amazes me no end. <BR>   However the album was slightly let down by Wearing and Tearing and especally Walter's Walk both of which seem slightly tedious and disjointed. <BR>   In all though Coda is a very underrated album, with 6 out of 8 songs sounding great, however, like many of the other reviews on this page point out, it seems a much better idea to buy the more famous zeppelin albums before this and leave this for the more hardcore fans (no matter how much they're played on the radio stations - because that makes them rubbish apparently)<BR>   So basically if you'r into led zeppelin then this is for you
1558002065|4.0|An audiobook abridged on two tapes, I absolutely adored listening to this story, even though it spends a very long time in a darker place, with kind of silent anguish that seems unable to get past the lips of the women telling their tales.<BR> <BR>Put more simplistically, the tale is told by four mothers and four daughters, the mothers born Chinese, the daughters born American in San Francisco. The story weaves from character to character, beginning with the death of one of the mothers, and the unfolding of a story that reaches backwards into her past, and ahead to the futures of all the children, and underlines the huge gap between generations that can so easily occur between countries, ages, and cultures.<BR> <BR>Touching, and read by the author (always my favourite), the tape kept my interest throughout, with that sort of aching soft sadness that grows - ever so slowly - into a superb sense of saved triumph. <BR> <BR>Definitely worthwhile as a reading and/or listening experience, I'm certainly going to hunt down more Amy Tan for my own listening pleasure.<BR> <BR>'Nathan
0141182601|3.0|The faults with this book lie completely with its length...it is just simply too long for what it has to say. I havent found myself being bored or anything, but still i wish Burgess would have put fewer pages in this book: it goes on and on when it really doesnt need to.<br />That being said, i enjoyed the book. The language takes some getting used to...even by the end of the book youll still wonder what some words mean (no, theyre not as obvious as everyone else says they are). This doesnt depreciate the value of this book though...actually i find it kind of fun. Sometimes it's fun not knowing exactly what he's saying. It gives the book a genuine feel to it...as though it is a diary.<br />Despite all of the horrible things Alex and his droogs do, you cant help feeling a little sad for Alex...you sort of get emotionally attached, but not too much. The novel is good at producing some sympathy for the criminal. Interesting, it is.<br />I sort of recommend it...actually, anything believed to be a classic is worth reading. I guess im just warning you that nothing really happens in this book, and you might walk away slightly disappointed. But classics do that sometimes. All in all, it's worth 3.5 stars.
B0001CNRS4|5.0|this is a gr8 movie 4 a female teen age group. theres good music (hiphop mostly), hot guys, good dance routines n a good story line. this is tha kinda film that makes u jus wana get up n dance! its similar 2 save the last dance, which is anuva 1 of my faves...i jus cant chose between tha 2 now :S so wot if its original? its a wkd movie! luv jenn xx
B0001FR3IQ|4.0|This movie is wonderful. I like it because it's really dark and quiet. The movie is a little predictable, but what movie isn't these days? My question was why does rob downey's character gotta be so darn sarcastic? It brings the movie down in my opinion. I understand they can't just believe her from the beginning, but did she really look like she could do that with the axe? come on. Anyway, I really liked the movie and I hope everyone gives it a chance. Halle's the best in the game right now so give her some love.
B00020HEG6|5.0|Oh I just LOVE this soundtrack. Its much different than the other Harry Potter soundtracks. Prisoner of Azkaban is together with order of the Phoenix my favorite book, Prisoner of Azkaban is one of my favorite movies and this is one of my favorite soundtracks :D. Woohooo! No scratch that, this is my favorite soundtrack of all time! (I'm just listening to the Quiddtich one, and - WOW!) Thanks John! :P<br />My fave's so far (have not heard the soundtrack completely, I am currently listening it) are 'Buckbeaks Flight', 'A Window to the Past'(a bit of a tear-jerker) and 'Quidditch, third year' YAY!
B00005JMEW|1.0|I knew it would be, but I was tricked into watching it. My co-workers were going to go watch kill bill 2 and told us all to watch the first one to know what was going on in the second. Either way, I never go to see 2, and on top of that I fell asleep during that too long fight scene with lucy lu. I was just disapointed. But I am anxious to see 2 so I'll know what becomes of Bill... i'm sure he dies though... seeing it's called kill bill. ultimately, if you don't like fight scenes that take up the better part of an hour and too much fake blood, this isn't he movie for you.
B0000DBJDM|5.0|dont heed any of the one star reviews on this page.this dvd features a great live performance from this classic band.five stars.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|OK,<BR>Read some of the reviews,and have seen this band multiples times. This album compared with how they performed live in '97, and compared to all the other bands that played that day, Slipknot was not in my top Five;however,this cd comparitively to the first two's releases is what Mansons Antichrist was for the entire rock scene of that time-Fresh,Hard,& Creative(or to the true Reznor fans that are older/wiser- what Pretty Hate did to the rest of the \\"crops\\" in that oversaturated music scene- This set kills (at least 10/14) everything out now and from the last year metal-wise period.Slpknt delves into new lines/directions,making new sounds, achieving greatness &  rawness, and pushing the norm for the otherwise seemingly darker side of metal that has been all the rage(thank you deftones:)..if you want that loop your Iowa disc and reside in metal-mania, this cd beats that one down with a big stick, and plays better live<BR>watch out for the evolution in music, or else you'll \\"Gator\\" yourself right off the ramp and out on the street with no two feet.for the diehard fans that need the same all time..no worries-I can appreciate that too.Look at Fumanchu,AIC,or Sex Pistols..and how they stick with the same formula throughout their cds.BUT: it is in most bands better interest to evolve naturally through sounds variants with time(I.E. Nirvana - Bleach,Incest'de,Nevermind{each more accessible by the masses with every release,yet the talent/lines they explore mature and become more complex yet still static}check out Auf Der Maur,Local H,Franz Ferdinand,& Velvet Revolver for newer lines in the industry,retro rock is in/HipHop is played out.you make the call
B00008PX8P|5.0|this is one of the best dvd's i possess and features stellar performances of all their great songs.very highly recommended.a must have in every rock fans collection.
6304341849|5.0|Fans of Merchant Ivory's A Room with a View will find similarities here, in style and sensibility as well as the casting of secondary characters.  This can be distracting if your first thought upon seeing Denholm Elliott is \\"Mr. Emerson!\\" but also lends a depth of place to the film.  After all, both Maurice and A Room with a View were written by E.M. Forster; it's appropriate that some of the same faces should populate the world of both films.  And certainly, after watching Rupert Graves as Alec Scudder climb in through Maurice's shadowed window, I'll never see Freddy Honeychurch the same way again.<br />The most surprising and poignant performance of the film, however, belongs to Hugh Grant as the aristocrat who chooses society over love.  After seeing Grant play nothing but cads and floppy bumblers (and play them well), I was astonished that he could convey sincere affection for another man as well as all the subtleties of Clive's struggle to deny his love for Maurice.  It's a shame he's been cast in so few dramatic roles since this film.<br />But aside from the context of the film and the skills of the actors, this is a touching, gently rendered story of a young man's growing acceptance of himself, and the joy that can come from choosing love over material wealth and status.  In that sense it's as universal as any other romance and can - should - be enjoyed by anyone who views it with an open mind.
B00009TB5G|5.0|The extended versions of these movies are even better than the originals.  They're so good, in fact, that I wish they would skip the standard edition and just go right to the extended one.  Great movie, and the best mastered DVD I've seen yet.
B000274THQ|4.0|If you're a sucker for the ethereal, transcendent music of Yann Tiersen (Amelie), then you'll be drooling within the first minute of this warm, endearing import that sidesteps a few minor issues to be a sweet look at family, dedication, and Socialism. Daniel Bruhl stars as Alex Kerner, a young man (19ish) who had lived under the Socialist uprising within Germany, pre-Wall falling. The reason: his mother was a hardcore comrade, and right before Socialism dies, she falls into a coma and wakes up after Democracy has set in. The problem: she can't have any huge emotional trauma or she'll croak. So the stage is set for an often-hilarious little farce that guides the movie through plenty of physical comedy, wild setups, but an unfortunately long third act that could have used some trimming. I doth protest too much - Lenin is a sweet film that is much a silly farce as a look at the lengths a son will go to save his mother and an examination of post-dissolution Germany. The movie seems like it's all mapped out in the beginning, but by the nostalgic finale, it has gone in some unexpected places and developed characters that seem insignificant at first (especially an early subplot of Alex having the hots for a nurse, whom he soon dates - a refreshing twist for once). It's the kind of movie, much like Amelie, that will have you walking out of the theater smiling and forgetting its shortcomings. If a third-act subplot of a long-lost father had been excised from the movie, I'd be going nuts about it. As is, I'm still elated from seeing this enjoyable foreign film. GRADE: B+
1400034779|5.0|This is a quiet, charming look at life in a small village in Botswana through the eyes of its lovely, chubby lady detective. How refreshing she is! How manipulative! How utterly wonderful! You will adore her. Although the idea of setting mysteries in far away locales has been done and done again, this one rises above the rest. And teaches us something in the process.
6301954947|5.0|Isn't there a way to vote on Amazon for this to be released on DVD (region 1)?  This film is incredible, and the battle scenes are truly epic.  It's an injustice not to have the film on the best media available.
B00022LRXA|4.0|This is more &quot;essential&quot; Eno, imho. From the truly pop-oriented brilliant round-like &quot;Backwater&quot; to the intensity of &quot;King's Lead Hat&quot;, Eno adds great music throughout - some somber, some slightly eclectic, some dreamy, lots of interesting music on this album. Great addition to any Eno collection, and a solid example of his work. I started with the album way back when, then the CD... and now of course I'll have to purchase the remastered version.
B00005JLR8|5.0|Director Jim Sheridan (\\"In The Name Of The Father\\", \\"My Left Foot\\") has crafted one of the most emotionally honest and satisfying films in years.  Paddy Considine (solid and tender) and Samantha Morton (emanating subtlety) star as Irish parents of two young girls who move to New York City to pursue Paddy's acting.  The move is also a distraction from the recent loss of their young son.  The summer heat is oppressive, the living conditions are near squalor and the local residents are junkies.  Despite this gloom and terrible poverty, the family thrives happily, mostly due to the amazing resilience and resolve of the two young daughters.  The loss of their son and an impending dangerous pregnancy are set against a backdrop of constant near danger and immense naivety (yet remarkable intuition) of the girls.  Mateo, (Djimon Hounsou) the AIDS stricken painter downstairs befriends the girls and provides some of the most frightening and yet emotionally substantial moments in the film.  Sheridan can take simple scenes like gambling the families rent money on a carnival doll for his child and turn it into pure suspense.  The family is always in near crisis, yet they survive day by day, relishing everything those `in America' take for granted.  Sheridan portrays a wonderful story of loss, survival and love, but never becomes maudlin or overly sentimental.  This is a rare film about real emotions.
B000001IPL|5.0|Smash is The Offspring's 3rd CD(Released in 1994), and it's their most popular, containing 14 tracks.<br /> Right around when Grunge and Alternative Rock were ruling the charts and the airwaves, a little Punk Band out of Los Angeles called The Offspring did the unthinkable.On the independent label Epitaph, they released the album Smash, and it eventually sold over 4 million copies, an unthinkable amount for an independent CD. Cruising on the heels of the smash hit singles &quot;Gotta Get Away&quot;, &quot;Come Out And Play(Gotta Keep 'Em Separated)&quot;, and &quot;Self Esteem&quot;, Smash rode up the Billboard Charts until it reached the unimaginable peak of No.4. With Smash under their name, The Offspring rose to the upper echelons of punk, giving Green Day and Weezer a run for their money and making all of their future albums smash hits to. So does this album live up to its glorious achievements? Well, to put it in one word, a resounding YES. Read Below for a Track reviews.<br />Track reviews:<br />Time to Relax-Intro(Not Rated)-Sets the stage perfectly!<br />Nitro(Youth Energy)-10/10:How was this not a single?

Truly inspired lyrics and an incredibly catchy chorus!<br />Genocide-9/10: The highlight of this song is Noodle's guitar playing and the addictive chorus, yet the lyrics are stupid and it gets a bit repetitive.<br />Something to Believe In-10/10: Yet again, another song that could have easily been a single! Noodle's riff sounds slightly Sabbathy,and Holland's vocals are inspired, especially during the<br />chorus.<br />Come Out And Play(Gotta Keep 'Em Separated)-15/10: Who hasn't heard this song, and who doesn't love it? The answer is No One song about Gang Violence that has the 2nd best riff on the<br />entire album, with a remarkable Sitar(Kind of Middle Eastern Guitar)solo throughout the song. The best chorus on the album, and the BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM!<br />Self Esteem-14/10:Just a little behind Come Out and Play, Self Esteem has the single best Guitar riff, best bass beat,and the best lyrics on the entire album. Only a really stupid chorus mars this gem of a song.<br />It'll Be A Long Time-10/10:One of the fastest songs on the album, it never slows down, even during the super-fast chorus!Great instrument playing!<br />Killboy Powerhead-10/10:Holland's vocals are superb, and Noodle's riff sounds reminiscent of Slash's on Paradise City after the chorus.This one's fast too!<br />What Happened To You?-10/10: Come on, this has to be a single! This sound echoes a touch of Reggae,but The Offspring blends it with punk perfectly!Great vocals!<br />Not the One:10/10-Great lyrics, Great vocals, Great guitar riff, and great drumming. Overall an excellent song, kind of slow though!<br />Smash-9/10:Like every other song on the album, this song has a killer riff mixed with an equally killer chorus. Points taken off though because this one gets repetitive.<br />Overall, every song is a classic, and this album is basically perfect.Although every song sticks to the same method(Killer riff, catchy vocals and lyrics, and emphasis on choruses in particular), each song maintains a sense of originality and no two songs sound alike.

B0000C6E4D|3.0|I became a Sarah McLachlan fan w/ the debut of &quot;Surfacing&quot; in 1997, so much so that I bought &quot;Fumbling Toward Ecstasy&quot; and &quot;Solace&quot; right away.  After the runaway success of her last singles, such as &quot;Building a Mystery&quot; and &quot;Adia,&quot; I was eager for more Sarah, and I have to say, for the amount of time it took for a new album, I was very disappointed.  After getting an idea of the tracks in the car w/ one friend, I borrowed the CD from another, and here I just don't see much of the spark or melody so apparent in the last three original albums.  &quot;Fallen&quot; is a pleasant song but I agree w/ other reviewers that it could easily have been stuck on &quot;Surfacing&quot; as a nice B-side.  The two best tracks on the CD are &quot;Stupid&quot; and &quot;Time&quot; (if you haven't seen it already, check out the video for &quot;Stupid&quot;--it's really good).  With lyrics like &quot;'cause I'm a train wreck waiting to happen,&quot; it's not hard to understand why the rest of the album is, to some extent, a train wreck itself, albeit a serene one.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|Fritz Lang was indeed Jewish by his mother. I had seen many previous videotape and DVD versions of Metropolis but this longer version beats them all hands down. It's like I'd never seen this film before as so much new (to me) was in this version. Including more fleshing out scenes of the privelaged, rich class of which Freder is a member of. To the poster named Jeff, M was made by Lang while he was still in Germany. I sure look forward to seeing other silent Lang films anbd even longer versions of Metropolis in the future. Buy it today!
B00008GKEG|5.0|An excellent series. I enjoyed every minuete of it. The only complant I would have is that its a constant reminder that John is gone since there obviously isn't any current interviews with him as there were with the other three. But thats to be expected. Otherwise its a must for any bealtes fan.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|The whole &quot;Avril is a poser&quot; thing is really old.  You don't know her personally so you shouldn't be able to judge her.  If you don't like her music, then don't listen to it.  It's as simple as that.  You weren't asked to tell about how you feel about how she dresses and what not, you were asked to review the CD.  To the people that like Avril, her songs make them happy, and that's all that counts.
B000268QB2|5.0|Make all the comparisons you want - and there are definitely a few to be made - but this album stands on its own as one of the best this year.  I got turned on to Keane by my girlfriend in the UK, I was able to get a hold of &quot;Somewhere Only We Know&quot; and have been amazed ever since.<br />Everyone says it - the voice.  Tom Chaplin simply has a stunning voice - and after seeing him live in SF, I can attest that it is just as good live.  I certainly get a bit of Freddie Mercury as one reviewer said, and Bono, but it's still quite unique, I'd recognize it anywhere.<br />The great thing for me about Keane, is that all the elements (Piano, Percussion, Vocals) seem to work - together - none taking too much of a center stage (or at least not all the time) - sure the voice gets the most notice, but without the very strong support of the drums and piano, it wouldn't &quot;soar&quot; the way it does.<br />Buy this CD, you won't regret it.
B00005JN0A|1.0|I came in with high hopes on this movie seeing it first on DVD, especially the \\"Unrated\\" version since Old School's was so good, but all I got was a sick feeling to my stomach as I think I finally discovered when 'pushing the limit' can go too far.  I don't understand how the filmmakers can perceive full male nudity multiple times, an excessive amount of male touching, a child acting like a Nazi, destroying and downright offending the Vatican is funny.  Even the 'bonus' female nudity seemed to go on just long enough to make everyone feel awkward.  Granted there was some really funny parts throughout the movie, but by the end of it everyone in our group was too scared to watch in fear of seeing another male's butt on the screen.  <br />I think the only thing it truly showed was how sick and deranged Hollywood can get to up the ante.  It's possible to have a sex-based teen comedy that actually has substance (go see \\"Girl Next Door\\"), but that requires developing a plot that doesn't need cliches to make laughs.  I'd even place \\"Tomcats\\", \\"Road Trip\\", and every single \\"American Pie\\" before this.  Also, the original ending was WAY more believable and was actually a better finish, but they thought it wasn't a crowd pleaser - so they sold a movie cliche again!<br />I'm not a hater, I was just really disturbed by this movie and want to warn people to rent it before buying it!
0385512104|5.0|What a wonderful read this was! I've had this on my list of &quot;to read&quot; for a while now. It has to be now one of my favorites.<BR>Perhaps because of the unusual plot, or perhaps, the main character, Christopher.<BR>Told from an autistic young man's view of the world, this book is not only great because it's just simply a well-written novel, but such because of the author's wondrous ways of showing us autism in its own spectrum.<BR>My son is three &amp; has some minor autistic behavior, and though I know much about the disorder, this book really helped me to &quot;understand&quot; how an autistic person sees life.<BR>You don't have to have any &quot;need&quot; for reading this. It is truly engrossing, touching, and funny. The characters are uneven slices of a messy, sloppy pie. But they are Christopher's and by golly, he accepts them all graciously &amp; makes them all a world that might not ever reach perfection, but will always see another door opening for them.<BR>Don't pass this one up!
B000002VQQ|5.0|I had never heard of Patti Smith last March when a friend of my parent's gave me the \\"Horses\\" LP 33\\" vinyl as a birthday gift. I put it on and gave it a shot... The results were phenomenal. Aside from Christina Aguilera's \\"Stripped\\", (YES! Christina Aguilera, be quiet! lol), and everything of Moloko's, Patti Smith's \\"Horses\\" is the best album ever to have graced my ears.<br />1) Gloria - A rockin' cover of Van Morrison's classic. 10/10<BR>2) Redondo Beach - A light reggae tune. 9/10<br />3) Birdland - My favorite on the album, this is Patti at her finest. Stream of Poetry that has beautiful results. 10/10<BR>4) Free Money - A haunting punk rocker. 10/10<BR>5) Kimberly - A lighter, more bouncy song with heartfelt lyrics. 9.5/10<BR>6) Break It Up - A strange vandetta of true Patti vocals and true Patti lyrics. 9/10<BR>7) Land - Awesome. A montage of three great songs. Similar to 'Gloria'. 10/10<BR>8) Elegie - A haunting ballad. 9/10<BR>(Since recieving the original LP record, I have recently purchased the CD for when I'm on the go, so I recieved the bonus track 'My Generation' on the CD.)<BR>9) My Generation - A somewhat messy, but good nonetheless B-Side which you can listen to while head-banging. 9.5/10<br />**I will most definetely be buying more of Patti's items in the futture. I highly recommend 'Horses' as a classic.**
B0001NBMBC|5.0|For those of you that don't like this album because it's not like the other 2, you're freaking wrong!  This album still sounds like Slipknot on every track, including the acoustic ones.  The only difference is that the screaming vocals praising obscenities, death and hatred have been to an extent removed and replaced with better lyrics and better guitars (to include solos).  Yes, Corey Taylor stills screams like he always does, but at least he's got the f@#ing balls to show that he's more than that.  This album proved that he's the vocalist you always thought he could be.  And the guitarists have shown that they didn't want to be upstaged by Corey's outstanding vocals and have stepped up as well, with new riffs, solos, and melodies, with tracks including acoustic guitars.  Now, a band that can go from screaming and deathly fatal guitars on one track to singing and melodic acoustic guitars on the next, demonstrates more ability than a band that does only one thing and sounds the same on every song.  Slipknot's latest release is definitely worth buying, and listening to over and over again.
0375703764|4.0|House of Leaves was a very enjoyable read. Reminded me a little of H.P. Lovecraft (although I do think that Danielewski is more effective in presenting a scary story with characters that slowly get crazier and crazier as they get deeper into &quot;The house&quot;), but in a very unique way.<br />First, it is a horror story. As I said, a story where the author effectively uses everything that he can to convey the scare and insanity going through the characters' minds while they try to solve a very bizarre mystery. Trying not to keep away from spoiling the story, it is not an easy read. Very often the story goes away from the main investigation on the &quot;house&quot; and starts to dwell on the psychological meaning of what is happening, drawing analogies from a number of works (some fictitious) in a good number of different languages (don't worry, translation is provided to almost all of them).<br />This makes the book harder to read, and sometimes a little frustrating. You get to the climax of something and you want to know what happens and then there is a whole chapter talking about things that look completely unrelated.<br />Anyway, this is not the reason I gave only 4 stars. My greatest issue with the book is that the characters, in my point of view, do not make much sense. They don't look very believable. It may be just me, but it did annoy me enough to remove a star.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I have been waiting almost a year for there new cd. I read a review in a magazine in MAY of 2003 that they were going to be recording new music and that they hoped to get the new cd out in September of 2003. Never happened as I waited till October. I heard they would release it in December of 2003. Never happened. Now in May of 2004 on May 25 there new cd \\"Volume 3 The Subliminal Verses\\" was released. I like the song \\"Durality\\" and that song is awesome. If you liked Joey's drumming in the last two cd's wait till you here this cd. <br />I read out of magazines about it and saw pictures of there new masks and I thought this was going to be heavier then the last one by what there masks looked like. There masks are way cooler but I kind of miss the older masks.<br />This is way different then both albums. Stonesour has changed Corey, but Murderdolls has not changed Joey. No screaming. No parental advisory. At first I thought it was a joke. Now when I hear Corey I think of Stonesour and I don't want to. I want to think of Slipknot but I'm starting to realize that it is Slipknot by listening to it over and over again.<br />You have to listen to this cd two times to actually get use to there new sound. The first time you concentrate more on Corey's vocals but the second listen you start to realize that it's still good in other ways. You pay more attention to the drumming and the guitar and realize that not everything has chnaged. They also brought back the turntable which is used in most of the songs. One big change is that there are no swear words at all. I think its cool though.<br />It now feautures acoustic guitar which is awesome in Vermilion Pt.2. More guitar playing kind of like old Metallica. <br />1-Prelude 3.0-(3:57)-10/10<BR>2-The Blister Exists-(5:19)-10/10<BR>3-Three Nil-(4:48)-9/10<BR>4-Duality-(4:12)-10/10<BR>5-Opium of the People-(3:12)-8/10<BR>6-Circle-(4:22)-10/10<BR>7-Welcome-(3:15)-10/10<BR>8-Vermilion-(5:16)-10/10<BR>9-Pulse of the Maggots-(4:19)-10/10<BR>10-Before I Forget-(4:38)-8/10<BR>11-Vermilion PT.2-(3:44)-10/10<BR>12-The Nameless-(4:27)-10/10<BR>13-The Virus of Life-(5:25)-10/10<BR>14-Danger, Keep Away-(3:20)-8/10 <br />I'm a little worried to listen to the older Slipknot albums now because I like there new stuff better. I don't know what my reaction would be like when I hear it.<br />Overall this is a great album. It is good for any fan of metal/rock
6300216268|5.0|I watched this movie the first time with a bunch of friends, and the general consensus was that it was the best movie they had ever seen. It's hilarious, sweet, and rather disturbing... but overall an excellent movie, and my current favorite.
B000002J09|5.0|This album is AMAZING! Much heavier than its predicessors but is just amazing. Each track so different and catchy riffs. Then the AMAZING Stairway....i mean. who doesn't know stairway? And everybody has a Led Zeppelin reference. What is there to say about this album? This was at the peak of rock. The climax. When blazing guitars and screaming bloody murder vocals along with a heavy blast of pounding drums and a amazingly grooving bass met and created musical rock fusion. As for those idiotic satanic messages.... yes. It does say Satan when you play it backwards. But if you actually listen to the lyrics it sounds like they're making fun of him and how moronic he is. Anyways the satan crap is B.S. and get this album. It genius.
B00008H2LB|2.0|lp is now a lame band...<BR>no more songs like crawling or with you...<BR>i used to listen hybrid theory but meteora sucks hard<br />ill nino is much better
B000060P79|1.0|First of all, who is this lead singer?  He sounds like he is a prepubescent eunuch with walrus adenoids.  Come on people, so you would work for 3 hours at McDonald's on minimum wage to save up for a crappy CD by a band like this?  Just the thought of that alone is pathetic.  Think about it, is 3 hours at Micky Dee's really worth this drivel?  I bet if NSYNC tried to play musical instruments like guitars and drums, they would sound better than this.  When i bought this CD and listened to it, i decided to try to see how much damage the CD could withstand.  I lit my cigarette lighter under it---the CD did not burn---D*mnit.  OK, how about boiling it water on the stove----the d*mn CD did not melt.  OK, i tried bending real hard--i was trying to break it in two---do you know what happened??????!!!!  IT BROKE AND CUT ME---I WAS BLEEDING!!!!!---I now hate this CD and this band even more.   Hopefully my cut won't get infected.  My ears already are infected by the supposed music this band claims to make----and that is the worst part.  My ears are precious, but now they are tainted by the music that sounds like it came out of my rear end after alot of straining and pushing over the toilet.  DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK---BUY 12 BIG MACS AT MICKY DEE'S INSTEAD
B00009TB5G|4.0|&quot;The Two Towers&quot;, as you know, is the second installment in the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy. This is good movie, but my least favorite of the three. I'll tell you what I DON'T like first, and then tell you what I DO like, althought there is more DO's than DONT's.<br />  I've always thought that this movie's acting was not as convincing as 'The Fellowship of the Ring', the first installment. Especially the 'Extended' scenes on this DVD. As much as the scenes do indeed provide a better backdrop on the story and characters, the only one that I liked was the flashback scene between Boromir and Faramir.<br />  In the Special Extended Edition of 'Fellowship', the scenes were well acted and actually entertaining, pulling you further into the depth of Middle-Earth. Not that these don't do that, but not as much, and not as well.<br />  Some of the scenes are kind of corny, like when Gandalf first comes back and appears to Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli. In the Special Edition, after shooting at him, Legolas kneels down, and says &quot;Forgive me - I mistook you for Saruman.&quot; Then Gandalf says, &quot;I am Saruman. Or rather Saruman as he should have been.&quot; I thought it sounded kind of fake.<br />  But it got even worse as they were walking through the forest, and Gimli says he can't wait to get out such a stinking forest, to which the trees instantly start groaning and shaking. Then Gimli starts trembling and says, &quot;I mean lovely, charming, beautiful,&quot; blah, blah, blah. It sounded more like little-kid comedy.<br />  Also some of the lost scenes with Merry and Pippen are kind of corny. But there is one part at the end of the movie, where they discover Saruman's store room, that might make more sense to their scene in 'Return of the King', where they're seen feasting and drinking at the flooded tower.<br />  I don't know why the acting wasn't as good in this as it was in the first. Many roles were well played, but others weren't as satisfactory. Eowyn talks kind of awkwardly (I'm glad she settled down in 'The Return of the King'), and Eomer seems too, &quot;Oh, I'm so cool to be in Lord of the Rings.&quot;<br />  The second big problem I have with this film is that it doesn't advance the story very much. The only significant thing that happens is that Saruman is taken care of. That stetches out over the ENTIRE movie. I thought it kind of odd and a little boring at times.<br />  Obviously it moves the story in some ways, but in a lot of ways it doesn't. In 'Fellowship', Frodo goes halfway across the earth in half the movie, and is last seen heading into Mordor.<br />  In 'Towers', he is captured and gets a total of about two miles. It also ends with him heading into Mordor. I mean, I know some of these things are essential to the story, but why spread it alllll out over one three-hour movie? I'm not saying they should have only had two movies, but I'm mostly blaming Tolkein.<br />  You might not believe it from the big stink I've made, but all this isn't enough to ruin the movie or even put a dent in it. It's just a tiny flaw, but a flaw that I can stomach.<br />  Now for the good things. Like in 'Fellowship', the special effects are incredible. So are the landscapes. Maybe not as much as Movie One, but this film definately sucks you into Middle Earth and its cultures.<br />  We can almost believe that there is indeed a land of Rohan, since they go so deep into the culture and history. It's amazing. Theoden was played brilliantly by Bernard Hill, as was Grima Wormtongue by Brad Dourhif.<br />  Helm's Deep was a great battle sequence, and the special effects used in that were outstanding. It is an epic battle that portrays the unending fight of good against evil, and the measures that good will go to win. And that is yet one of the amazing things about this whole story. There is such a clear line between good and evil, and shows to what great lengths and sacrifices must be made for good to endure. It shows that evil cannot be comprehended with. Evil does not negotiate. Evil cannot be softened or altered. Evil must be destroyed, or it will destroy you. I think this applies very much to our own situation now.<br />  The music to this film is once again well done by Howard Shore, sensational, even. The music to 'Helm's Deep','Last March of the Ents', 'The Flooding of Isengaard' and 'The Stories that Really Mattered', were all terrific, climactic melodies. I also loved the Rohan music. Another well-done job by the music team.<br />  Gollum must be the most realistic CGI character ever created. I'm glad they didn't use a real man as Gollum, because you cannot get the same motions or reactions as you can a CGI character. It makes you feel as if this character is partly human, yet is also something completely differant and on its own. Like its not part of our world, which Gollum isn't.<br />  Overall, I like this film A LOT. Although I liked 'Fellowship' and 'King' better, this is still better than almost any other movie out there. Any fans of Tolkein or the movies would do themselves a favor to buy this, especially the Special Extened Edition. Although some scenes, as I said were corny, it is worth it to get the backdrop.<br />  This is a good middle to a great series!vil cannot be comprehended with. Evil does not negotiate.

B0001NBMBC|5.0|Since Black Sabbath has there been a band to capture talent in the void. Song after song just displays the pure power and talent that they just spit out into world. If there was a band to open the doors of imagination and allow the rest of the world to just have a glimps of a materpiece it would be this albulm. Corey's voice is so deeply immersed into the music the that James and him flow off of each other is a like if you could a write a Balaet to buther's night mare. Pure Genious. Thank you for putting out a quality cd that allows us as fans have faith that true metal is still out there.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|Avril Lavigne's newest album &quot;Under My Skin&quot; is awesome!

B000020617|5.0|Foo Fighters are a very dynamic band in '90s rock, it had a different lineup for their first three albums. Instead of the name 'Foo Fighter' it can also be seen as ex-Nirvana Dave Grohl's solo efforts. Infact the first album by 'Foo Fighters' were almost completely recorded by Grohl himself. The debut album was good but it took two more albums to reach their peak. The songs in 'There is Nothing Left to Lose' are catchy in every sence of the word. It is the first Foo Fighters album that sounds like the work of a unified, muscular band. There is Nothing Left to Lose has a stripped-down sound and an immediate attack that makes even the poppier numbers rock hard. The organic, natural sound is welcome, but the album also benefits from the strongest set of songs Grohl and the Foo Fighters have yet written. There are the typical strong singles, but there's no fat or filler; each track has a memorable hook or melody, and they seem all the more catchy because they're delivered with conviction and confidence. Apart from the hits also watch out for the other songs also. Quite yummy. BTW just want to mention it won a grammy for Best Rock album Of the Year (although I feel winning a grammy is disgraceful rather than worthy of credit).
0375713751|2.0|Of course, the kids drew me to this book, but there<BR>really wasn't enough of the kids  to satisfy me.<br />           The story never really got me involved. It's like the author tried to cram too much into each sentence to exhaust the reader, and prove that the main character was too busy. It is my personal belief that women should stay with their kids. It not only benefits the kids, but also the parents. It's just too bad that practically the whole book went by before she realized this. <br />           I would have rather read about a stay at home mom <BR>who struggled, but took great care of her children. This is the first book I have read by this author, and now I'll be scared to read others by her. I rated I Don't Know How She Does It a 2.5 stars:)
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I completely missed this series when it was on television, but the premise of the show sounded so interesting that I bought the DVD.  This is something you will like even if you generally dislike science fiction; the show was a throwback--a story-driven television series with fascinating characters, a new world to visit every episode, and plenty of action.  My wife and I almost never share the same taste in movies and TV shows, but we watched every episode together.  The best part is that there is enough complexity to the show that you can watch more than once and notice things you didn't before.  Firefly is better than anything I have seen on the big or small screen in a long while.  Fans of Star Wars, Indiana Jones, or just great storytelling should get this.  You will feel a part of Captain Mal Reynolds spaceship before the end of the first episode.  Each of the nine main characters are the focus of at least one of the episodes, so while the series was short-lived, you gain quite an understanding of who they are, and it is fun to speculate on the many questions that are left unanswered.  I usually only rent DVDs, but this is one I am glad to own because this may be the one TV show where the reruns never get old.  A movie, Serenity, is about to go into production with the original cast intact!
B00005JMEW|4.0|&quot;Kill Bill&quot; was either a disaster-in-the-making or a one of a kind hit -- a sprawling revenge flick that had to be cut in two and released separately. But director Quentin Tarantino serves up entertainingly mindless gore and twisted thrills in &quot;Kill Bill Volume 1,&quot; a salute to homages.<br />Tragedy strikes the Bride (Uma Thurman) on her wedding day: The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (DiVAS) attacks and slaughters the guests, the groom, and wounds the very pregnant Bride herself. Her former boss/lover Bill (David Carradine) finishes the bloodbath by shooting the Bride in the head. But despite his efforts, she isn't dead.<br />A few years later, the Bride wakes to find that she has been in a coma for a few years, and has been being used as a sex toy for rent. After recovering enough to move, the Bride gets a sword sharp enough to &quot;cut God,&quot; and goes on a revenge spree against the people who wrecked her life and killed her baby, including Cottonmouth (Vivica A. Fox) and the deadly O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu).<br />Don't expect cinematic art in &quot;Kill Bill Volume 1.&quot; If anything, this is cinematic pop art, a loving tribute to cheesy martial-arts flicks and westerns. Tarantino even inserts a stretch of anime detailing O-Ren's background. It's pure Tarantino, untainted by typical directing methods and immensely entertaining if you switch off your critical faculties, refrain from asking &quot;How the heck could that happen?&quot;<br />&quot;Kill Bill&quot; isn't for the weak of stomach; over 450 gallons of fake blood are used in both movies. But the blood usage is more &quot;Monty Python&quot; than &quot;Braveheart&quot;; it's so over-the-top that it's silly and sick rather than disturbing. So is the violence -- hacking dozens of people down without getting so much as a scrape is impossible, but it's sure fun to watch.<br />Tarantino throws out more one-liners than just about any other filmmaker around. The absurd &quot;Trix is for kids&quot; line aside, there are a number of great lines like &quot;Those of you lucky enough to have your lives take them with you. However, leave the limbs you've lost. They belong to me now.&quot; The script teems with impossibilities, but they seem plausible enough in this alternate reality that Tarantino has cooked up. Call it Tarantinoland.<br />Uma Thurman, with her yellow tracksuit and katana, rules the screen as the Bride. Despite the Bride cutting down people by the dozen, it's impossible not to appreciate her. And the best supporting performances come from Liu as the ruthless O-Ren, Carradine in a brief but intense appearance, and the wonderful, underrated Chiaki Kuriyama as evil schoolgirl Go-Go Yubari.<br />It's silly, it's creepy, it's gaudy, and somehow it's vastly entertaining. Tarantino's special triumph in &quot;Kill Bill Volume 1&quot; is to somehow rope his vast store of movie homages into a gory, action-packed storyline, and one that is, at the very least, hard to forget.&quot; line aside, there are a number of great lines like &quot;Those of you lucky enough to have your lives take them with you.

B00008EY65|5.0|I went and saw HB 7 times I think this movie is awesome. Ron Perlman did a fantastic job. He made the movie. I think everyone should see this movie at least once and then buy it. I'm so glad it will be on sale in July instead 6 months from now. I can't wait to have ot for my very own.
B0000019PA|1.0|First off this record aint no good! 2nd if you are into bad warbly out of tune voices set against some vaugely interesting music then this might be for you 3rd if you're a fan of the Elephant 6 label just stick with early Apples in Stereo... 4th I have no idea what the appeal is here but this record is clearly overrated. <br />Instead try the new disc by The Tyde called &quot;twice&quot; plenty of melody set against some interesting gritty psych twang.  CHEERS!
0140177396|4.0|Dontae Sizer<br />  Of MICE AND MEN is about two stangers who lived in Soledad California in the 1930's. George and Lennie didn't have a home. Where ever they worked is where they slept at. George didn't have a family,but he is real street smart. On the other hand, Lennie was diffrent. HE was mentaly retarded, tall, strong and had only one person in his life,his Aunt Clara. Before  his Aunt Clara died she asked George to look after Lennie for her, and George and Lennie been together every since then. The problem that George had is he is walking around with a mentally retarded person who forgets almost every thing you tell him, and who only is good for picking heavy things up.<br />   Two other people in the book were poorly developed, but to me it was interesting.I Liked it because I undersood the vocabulary <BR> I heard somebody with the same problem before, like taking care of a person who gives you hell. In the begining of the novel, George didn't care for Lennie. He was just keeping his promise he made to Lennies Aunt.At the end it was like Lennie was a brother George never had. Thats another reason why I like the book because of the endind.It feel like you been in tht situation before,it's like I was in George place before.
0060273224|5.0|I love Sabriel. it's a book that you just can't put down. i think this should be turn into a movie. All of the Abhorsen trilolgy should there great. I'm reading Lirael now and it is great. i can't wait to read the next one. i wish Grath Nix could make some more about the old Kingdom . i just want to read Sabriel all the time. THIS BOOK IS GREAT. YOU READ ME THIS BOOK IS GREAT.
0060090383|2.0|I heard so many great things about this book and I couldn't wait to get started on it. Get started was all I did. I gave up about a quarter of the way into it. <BR>Oh well. Ya win some, ya loose some.
0553277472|5.0|I first encountered this book in a university education class a few years after it was released. For some reason, &quot;Zen&quot; was on the required reading list for we aspiring teachers and we all wondered why until we read the book. This book introduced us to the worlds of philosophy, chatauquas, as well as the basic workings of a motorcycle.  Pirsig takes us on simultaneous journeys--one across the United States with his son Chris, another as he pursues a higher education of the mind, and lastly one he takes with his son to discover each other for the very first time. <BR>I found the chapter where he examines the idea of Quality with his students to be readily applicable to my own interest in being a teacher. Also, the travel journal parts of the story are<BR>enjoyable in the same way as another traveler's writing--William Least-Heat Moon's &quot;Blue Highways.&quot;<BR>   The book is also a warning about the dangers of pursuing a life of the mind at the expense of human relationships and living in the real world. The coming together of the father and son at the book's close tells us all how precious and important relationships with our loved ones must come before all else.<BR>A great read twenty-seven years ago and still a classic one here in the twenty-first century.
B000002I25|5.0|This is a &quot;must&quot; album for any Doors Fan!  &quot;Light My Fire,&quot; &quot;Break on Through To The Other Side,&quot; &quot;Back Door Man,&quot; well these songs really sum up this superb album!!  This album was well thought out and listening to it is a pleasure!  Say what you want about &quot;The Lizard King&quot; the late Jim Morrison, when on, he was &quot;The Best&quot; rocker that I have &quot;ever&quot; heard!  You can see why this group was inducted into the &quot;Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame!&quot;  No Doubt!  I recommend purchase of this album!
B0001GL3K4|4.0|The interwoven story is great, the acting wonderful, and the cast is so star-studded I went blind!  What was most unbelievable to me, was the fact that almost all of the main characters had integrity: a widower raising his stepson after his wife's death, the author who courts his new found love instead of hauling her off to bed (even though they inhabit a house together for several hours a day), the man who denies his own feelings to walk away from a married woman...the list goes on.<BR>The only thing that prevented me from giving this 5 stars was the couple who are stand-ins for a porn film.  Why they had to stick this in was beyond me.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Kill Bill, Vol. 1 boastfully includes above the title, the fourth film by Quentin Tarantino.  While Uma Thurman is commanding in the lead role of the vengeful &quot;Bride&quot;, Mr. Tarantino is the star of the film.  Kill Bill is a visual roller coaster. Mr. Tarantino deftly mixes black &amp; white, color &amp; animation from his palate to paint a visual piece of art.  Mr. Tarantino has sometimes been accused of being something of a plagiarist in his films and in Kill Bill he invokes kung fu, spaghetti westerns, Saturday matinee cliffhangers and Japanese anime genres.  But instead of just copying, he molds them into his own unique vision.  The script is laced with typical snappy Tarantino dialogue and, as with his first three films, music plays a large part.  Mr. Tarantino uses Nancy Sinatra's somber version of &quot;Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)&quot; to perfectly set the mood for the film and the RZA's haunting score adds depth and feeling throughout.  The film is quite violent and brutal.  There are decapitations, hundreds of limbs being chopped off and countless bloody deaths, but they are necessary to the film.  The violence is somewhat cartoonish, when one character is decapitated, blood flows out like a fountain from his neck and when an arm is cut off, blood rushes out in an obscenely fast manner.  After a long absence from directing, Kill Bill, Vol. 1 is a most welcomed return from one of the few truly original directors in film today.
B00005JLYW|1.0|Much could be said about the first Charlie's Angels movie from late in 2000. It was fun, and full of action without going over the top to where it would've ruined the film. It's nothing to make history out of but it is plenty of fun and worth watching if you turn your `thinking' brain into off mode. Unfortunately I could never say the same positive things about it's disastrous sequel \\"Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle\\". I had a lot of expectations for more fun in \\"Full Throttle\\" but This sequel is like a rehash of the original except that all of the fun innocent flamboyance of the first one is thrown right out the window and the massive void left is nothing but a massive hodgepodge of eardrum-busting loud special effects, highly unrealistic stunts and nauseating and tacky innuendos which together completely ruin this lame excuse for a film.<br /> The plot is just hilariously bad and goes nowhere from the very start. The threesome trio are now assigned on a mission to recover some device that has top secret inscriptions in it that has gone missing and the witnesses to the crime have been turning up dead right and left and the three hunt down the culprit of the slayings and they discover that the villainess is actually a `fallen angel' named Madison Lee (Demi Moore) who betrayed them and went bad and now the mission is to recover the device before Madison gets a hold of it.<br /> A lot of the stunts are laughable and highly unrealistic even for most of the best stuntmen in the world and some of the chases and motorcycle stunts by both the good and bad guys would make even Evel Knievel cringe. How do they dodge bullets that are fired at them while they are in mid-air? Hell both the good and bad guys fire enormous hailstorms of bullets at each other while in mid-air on the motorcycles but not one of the rounds come close to their targets even though they are no more than a few feet away. Strange huh? The various special effects are just messy and excessively loud and overblown plus some scenes felt more like ripoffs of some sequences from the \\"Matrix\\" trilogy but faring much worse.<br /> The characters in the movie are absolutely stupid and completely kill off anything that could've been even remotely good about this film. The threesome trio resort to some of the dumbest female heroine behavior that I've ever seen in any movie and resorting to trashy behavior like some drunken stripper after having no sleep for several days. I'm no prude but this movie is just a sickening example of the exploitation of both genders and rendering the women characters as nothing but objects and the men as nothing but like canines going into season. I'm sorry but the characters come off as being absolutely stupid and without any personality.<br /> The cast of this movie is really excellent and could've been made a really spectacular movie but almost every actress and actor completely drops the ball on this one with completely bone dry acting and the script is weak and has no chance of being anywhere near consistent. The jokes by the minor background characters are not even funny and are just plain stupid to say the least. Demi Moore as the villainess Madison Lee isn't bad in my opinion but she really squandered her chance at creating a really formidable villainous character and comes off as being nothing more than a caffeine-drenched cat that has gone into it's season. And Moore went through heavy exercise training just for a measley few minutes throughout the whole film? They really squandered their chance at making Madison Lee a really formidable villainess. What a waste of a great opportunity! Bernie Mac is really funny as Bosley and I really liked Bernie's portrayal of Bosley because he is a really excellent comedian but even he could not save this sequel from becoming thermal depolymerization plant material. Madison Lee and Bosley were the only good things about this movie but their meager screen time could not add up to enough to save this moviefrom falling into the extreme end of mediocrity.<br /> This movie is a sad example of how the seedy parts of Hollywood are brought up from the bottom of the barrel right up to the big screen where both men and women are reduced to nothing but nymphomaniac puppies in season. I for one and not turned on by excessive innuendos. The first movie was saved by limiting such excessive tackiness but this sequel is loaded with completely repulsive innuendos throughout the movie and it's not even appealing at all. It's disgusting and absolutely insulting to anyone who values the other gender.<br /> This sequel ruins the fun legacy of the \\"Charlie's Angels\\" franchise and this movie has no destiny other than heading straight from the garbage truck right into the landfill or better yet, the thermal depolymerization plant where it belongs. It's really sad how we are wasting our natural resources in manufacturing awful movies like this. Don't even rent this garbage. There is no point in wasting one's time on such a lousy and pathetic film like this. If there is to be a third installment in the series, I have very low expectations for it being good but even then, I fear it will disappoint once again the same way \\"Full Throttle\\" did with me.<br />This could really have been a great sequel but they totally blew it with this one. Avoid this movie at all costs.vie from falling into the extreme end of mediocrity. <br /> This movie is a sad example of how the seedy parts of Hollywood are brought up from the bottom of the barrel right up to the big screen where both men and women are reduced to nothing but nymphomaniac puppies in season.

B000002G87|4.0|This is really a fine album.  I originally purchased this album in 1972 before I went off to Thailand while stationed at Homestead Air Force Base as a Sergeant.  My roommate and I played this album over and over and really enjoyed it!  It is definitely blues with some rock thrown in.  I would not say that I enjoyed each song on it but gave it 4 stars as I believe that there is something in it for everyone to enjoy.  This album is now truly classic and well worth buying!!  I would recommend this album.  Layla and Key To The Highway I feel are what holds this ablum together.
B0000WN0ZK|5.0|This may be the most emblematic movie to come out of the 1960's.<BR>It reduces everything we associate with the Psychedelic 60's...<BR> consciousness expansion, the individualism,<BR>the flamboyance, the hedonism and the self-indulgence... to a single philosophical question: \\"What is Reality?\\" and answers it with a resounding: \\"Who knows?\\"<BR>David Hemmings plays a successful fashion photographer in \\"swinging 60's London\\" by day, who moonlights as an \\"artiste\\" in his off-hours.  His fashion photography is done in color, his artistic work in black-and-white.  One of Antonioni's key themes<BR>is the contrast of the stark, unforgiving play of light and shadow in black and white film with the vivid garishness of color.  One day, while shooting off a roll of film in Greene Park, Thomas, our photographer, follows the path of two lovers,<BR>seemingly engaged in an illicit affair.  When he develops the pictures and blows them up, he discovers what looks suspiciously like a murder.  These suspicions are only exagerrated when the girl in the pictures (Vanessa Redgrave) shows up at his door and tries to seduce him out of the roll of film.  Needless to say,<BR>nothing proves to be exactly as it seems.  The continuous frustration of expectations, the denial of human responsibility and compassion were, unfortunately, what the 60's came to be all about.  <BR>From the rollicking, partying mimes who open and close the picture, to the snake-like seductiveness of Verushka in her photo<BR>shoot, to Yardbirds' guitarist Jeff Beck destroying his guitar in an angry fit near the picture's end, there's a surrealism to everything that's vertiginous.  This movie just continually makes your head spin!<BR>My one complaint is that no transfer I have yet seen has managed to restore the lushness and vividness of the original color print.  That's a shame, because the greeness of the grass in the scenes in Greene Park is so surreal, it is \\"psychedelic,\\" and that's essential to what's going on.<BR>Watch this movie and be AMAZED!<BR>\\"I thought you were supposed to be in Paris.\\"<BR>\\"I AM in Paris!\\"
6305232660|4.0|As far as disaster films go, this is one of the best.  The characters have a little more depth than your usual catastrophe cardboard cutouts and are played with conviction by a fine cast.  What good's a disaster if you don't really feel for the folks the disaster is happening to.  Unlike most other big budget disaster blockbusters, DEEP IMPACT has a decent script that takes itself seriously.  Add the cast, assured direction by MIMI LEDER, and some great fx visuals, and the end result is an extreemly enjoyable thrill ride that keeps head and heart intact.  It's amazing how this movie gets so much slack when most others in the genere are far inferior (i.e. ARMAGEDDON, DAY AFTER TOMORROW, etc.).

B000059T00|4.0|I purchased this album in 1969 while stationed at Wurtsmith Air Force Base with the 379th Supply Squadron &quot;Strategic Air Command&quot; (SAC).  Don't expect &quot;The Cream&quot; re-visited on this album OK?  Clapton plays some great &quot;licks&quot; on his guitar and Ginger Baker is superb on the drums but without Jack Bruce, well it falls a little if not alot short album wise.  It lacks a bit of flavor that only &quot;The Cream&quot; could make it.  Sort of like &quot;The Beatles&quot; without John Lennon if you catch my drift!  I would consider buying it again.  If you are a true Clampton fan &quot;buy it&quot; if not you might be a little disappointed.  In The Presence Of The Lord, is really the bright point on the album!

B0001MDQ6W|5.0|Dylan's more than deserving resurgence in recent years traces its birth back, in my opinion, to this incredible live performance from 1994. This show has it all, mixing old and new music that more than satisfies longtime fans such as myself while also managing to appeal strongly to the younger generation, many of whom would know Dylan only by name had MTV not provided the medium for him to prove his genius and longevity to them first-hand. Dylan's tendency to be reclusive and mysterious has made him inaccessible to some listeners in the past, but the energetically appreciative audience is an important part of this recording, and you can tell that Dylan is really enjoying the whole performance. He even smiles at one point; having seen Dylan perform live, I know just how rare an occurrence this can be.<br />The older songs are great, but they differ significantly from the original recordings (Dylan is constantly redefining and recreating his legendary classics); this may disappoint some fans, and I admit it took me a while to appreciate this particular version of The Times They Are A-Changin', but the soul of each song remains the same, no matter what kind of modernized or different interpretation Dylan decides to go with on a certain night. I love Tombstone Blues, and it does start the show off with a great kick. It's always nice to hear Dylan's All Along the Watchtower, if for no other reason than to let people know the song didn't originate with Jimi Hendrix. Rainy Day Women #12 &amp; 35 has never been a favorite of mine, but this version is an enjoyable splash of fun in between a couple of slow, serious songs. John Brown is a significant track, dating back to 1963 but never having been released. It vividly reflects the anti-war feelings Dylan expressed so forcibly in his formative years.  Dylan's newer songs only build on the musical momentum.  I was a little surprised to see Shooting Star from the Oh Mercy album included, but the track looks and sounds great and fits right in. Dignity was a brand new song at the time, standing as a true showcase of Dylan's unparalleled songwriting and performing skills.  He may have aged, but his musical vision and talent are eternal.<br /><br />Three songs particularly stand out to me. Desolation Row is a truly incredible, meaningful song that only Dylan could write and perform. Lasting more than eight minutes, it's the kind of song you never want to end. Knockin' on Heaven's Door really starts building the momentum that reaches its crescendo with my favorite Dylan performance ever of his greatest song, Like a Rolling Stone. Having wowed his audience for close to an hour, Dylan is definitely &quot;feeling it&quot; when he gets to this crowd-pleasing classic (after a rather humorous false start). Its length is matched only by its powerful delivery, and I get the feeling watching it that even Dylan is a little surprised at how great a show he is putting on.  He is absolutely on fire, and he knows it.  With God On Our Side is an interesting song with which to end the show, but it reflects the heart and soul of music's greatest songwriter. Following on the heels of a rocking performance, it reminds the audience that the old Dylan so many have loved for decades is still there, even if his classic songs have been given a fresh overhaul.<br />Having a rather small audience so close to the musicians makes this live performance a true personal triumph for Dylan, and the sense of intimacy between the legendary performer and his fans is powerful and palpable. Dylan never looked or sounded better than he did on this unforgettable night in 1994.  If you saw the performance on MTV, you should know that the DVD contains four bonus songs not included in the television broadcast (as well as one song - Love Minus Zero/No Limit - not included on the CD).  If you already have the CD, buy the DVD as well - the visuals capture the magical effects of the performance in ways the audio cannot.fits right in.

B000000HTM|5.0|I belatedly came across a copy of &quot;H to He&quot; in 1974 and was startled by what I heard. This was a breath of fresh air, relief from the tiresome soloing and abrasive synths of ELP and Yes. I quickly bought Pawn Hearts, which in my view confirmed VDGG as the gold standard in so-called &quot;progressive rock&quot;. Though guilty of the occasional excess, this album, and VDGG generally, should not be classed with much of the forgettable prog-rock puffery of its time. Pawn Hearts remains a remarkable album and a shining example of what this genre could produce.   <br />Pawn Hearts is dense music with primary reliance on piano and organ rather than synths, minimal guitars (though Robert Fripp contributes some wonderful work in a guest role), crazed saxes, vivid, occasionally brutal imagery, and searching, questioning lyrics. This is no &quot;And You And I&quot; style bliss-out, this is a cold hard stare at reality. Peter Hammill's lyrics paint a bleak tableau of confusion, pain and struggle, but they also recognize the human will's enormous power to overcome adversity. Don't buy this if you're looking for happy tunes. <br />By the way, I've noted that fans of VDGG tend to fall into two camps: those like me who prefer the band's earlier albums (the best being &quot;H to He&quot; and &quot;Pawn Hearts&quot;) and those who prefer the later era (the best being &quot;Godbluff&quot; and &quot;Still Life&quot;). All of these records are good, though with all due respect to &quot;Still Life&quot;, I've never felt it quite measured up to the other three I've mentioned. It is, however, not a bad place to start if you're new to VDGG. Of the earlier stuff, start with &quot;H to He&quot;. Pawn Hearts is a more challenging experience and probably not the best introduction.
B00008BRB5|5.0|Why am I the first one to review this album? This is a hailed as a rock classic everywhere, so why am I the first to review this? Well anyway, this is one of my favorite albums ever. When Every Breath You Take came out, it was my favorite song. And this classic album will surely stand the test of time. Sting sings up a storm here, with the classic bass. I love this album.
1884822312|2.0|When Polgar's &quot;Chess: 5334 Problems, Combinations, and Games&quot; first came out (in 1994), many chess coaches, including myself, thought of it as a great learning tool. I purchased a number of copies for my students to use. And although it is still a great tool, since its publication a number of excellent tactics manuals have come out and I no longer think of this work by Polgar as being one of the best. Many of these 5334 problems are seemingly artificial, they lack the feel of a real game (of coures, real games can get sort of bazaar looking). What would I recommend instead? Those at the top of my list would include: &quot;Winning Chess Exercises for Kids&quot; by Jeff Coakley (2004); &quot;Combinational Motifs&quot; by Maxim Blokh (2000); &quot;The Times Winning Moves&quot; by Raymond Keen &amp; Byron Jacobs (2003); and &quot;The ChessCafe Puzzle Book&quot; by Karsten Muller (2004), just to name a few. Of course, the right book depends on one's own chess strength (and so, it will vary from person to person).
B0001DI0FI|5.0|I love historical fiction such as Bernard Cornwell and Patrick O'Brien.  Shame not more of it is published.  So when this was turned into a movie I was thrilled and had trepidations.  Would they do it well?  They loving paid homage to O'Brien's works.  This film works with super performances, intense action sequences, talented acting, but it also shines in the smaller touches of humanity - good and bad.<br />Brilliant work!  Hope it paves the road for more like it.
B000002552|1.0|The Complete Basement Tapes, on five CDs, is the real deal. An essential recording for Dylan fanatics to be sure.<br />This poorly mastered, poorly packaged double CD is another matter.  The fraudulent Band tracks really do dilute this collection. Substituting Band recordings made AFTER \\"Music from Big Pink\\" for indisputable \\"real\\" basement tapes classics like \\"I Shall Be Released\\" and \\"Quinn the Eskimo\\" is truly unforgivable.  I admit that the 5-CD set may STILL not be a commericially viable proposition but why not release just the so-called \\"Basement Tapes Acetate\\".  This fourteen song \\"LP\\", rumoured to be recorded by Dylan to fulfill his expiring Columbia Records contract, purportedly consisted of the following tracks:<br />1. Million Dollar Bash<BR>2. Yea! Heavy and a Bottle of Bread<BR>3. Please Mrs. Henry<BR>4. Down in The Flood<BR>5. Lo and Behold!<BR>6. Tiny Montgomery<BR>7. This Wheel's On Fire<BR>8. You Ain't Goin' Nowhere<BR>9. I Shall Be Released<BR>10. Tears of Rage<BR>11. Too Much of Nothing<BR>12. Quinn the Eskimo<BR>13. Open the Door, Homer<BR>14. Nothing Was Delivered<br />Throw in \\"Going to Acapulco\\", \\"Odds and Ends\\", \\"Clothesline Saga\\", and \\"Apple Suckling Tree\\" (all Dylan tunes) and you have a potential blockbuster.  I really wish Columbia would delete this two volume bulky monstrosity with its dopey circus pictures and treat these recordings with the respect it deserves.  Especially now since The Band numbers have been released properly on THEIR \\"remastered\\" series.
B000002MP2|5.0|Dookie is one of the greatest alternative rock albums to ever be released. It has everything rock should have had in the mid 1990's. Just everything about the band showed that they knew what they were doing, they loved what they were doing, and the comedic lyrics top it all off. While many die-hard rock fans in the 1990's looked down opun them as a silly band (which they sometimes are, actually), I find this a album a great acheivement in the world of alternative pop rock.
0385508417|4.0|A friend of mine read this book to me over the phone, a chapter at a time. It is the perfect book to read aloud, and it doesn't even have to be Christmastime to enjoy it. I thought the book was so funny and sweet. This is a total change of pace from Grisham's usual books, but who says that can't be a good thing?<br />The characters are charming, and the twists and turns of trying to skip Christmas keep you guessing. A cute, light-hearted read.
0061015725|2.0|Have you ever read any other Michael Crighton novels?  If you have, dont' expect the same suspense, well thought out action sequences, and character development that are usual fixtures in his works.  Prey seemed like it was thrown together hastily.  It's as if he didn't have a lot of time to get the book together, and this was teh finished product.  The dust cover is pretty snazzy though...
B00008WT5C|5.0|This would be ACDC's final album before the highly commercialized and successful \\"Highyway To Hell\\".\\"LTBR\\" is in my opinion ACDC's greatest and toughest album.Bon Scott still remains the better lead singer of ACDC,I tend to disregard the band's material with screecher Brian Johnson(he just doesn't cut it).From the perverted \\"Go Down\\" all the way to the closing riffs of \\"Whole Lotta Rosie\\",the LP proves they rocked way harder back in the day and with much more attitude.The Young brothers' riffs are loud and pulse-pounding,Bon's voice tops it all off like a cherry whether it be the sly and sexy lyrics of \\"Go Down\\" or the fast and sleek feel of the title track.Back In Black is highly overrated and compared to this baby,this is one wins by a long shot just because of that raw and unpolished sound.Bon is the essential ACDC lead singer and all the material they put out in the 70s tops everything they put out starting with Back In Black.Long live ACDC and Bon Scott!!!
B0001NBMBC|1.0|I guess you need all the silly adolescent makeup and stupid shenanigans. This band is the silliest, least creative joke I have ever come across. The music is the most mundane, immature crap imaginable. Kids, grow up. It's ok to paint your face like twisted sister and laugh like Beavis and Butthead at death and gore when you're 15, but at some point you need to join the rest of us here in the real world. What's funny is to think about these guys coming home and taking a crap, maybe paying the electric bill and making a T.V. dinner. They're just normal, boring idiots like anyone else. They've just fooled stupid, lonely junior high school kids into buying into their little play time. America: if you will continue to purchase our feces, we will continue to crap it out. Sincerely, Slipknot.<br />Get a life, people.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|I first heard this CD while at my massage therapy session. I immediately noticed it because it wasn't the usual slow non verbal melody. It had rhythm and put me in a great mood. I bought it soon after and love to use it when traveling back and forth to work, the beat just puts me in a good mood and some days I really need that. It is a combination of hip hop, jazz, blues, and soul. Alicia can really work those vocals. A Must have!
0142004235|5.0|...in the Salinas River Valley in California.  Steinbeck is a master at developing characters so well that you think you actually know them personally half-way through the story.  This is the tale of multiple families, from all over the country, who end up in the Salinas Valley.  Their reasons for settling there vary from honorable to despicable.  Steinbeck's storyline mimics the one of Cain and Abel throught he lives of brothers in the book on the Trask side.  There are other families and characters that add a richness to the environment as well, such as the Hamiltons, Abra, and Lee the faithful servant. As you follow the lives of the Hamiltons and Trasks, you can't help but wonder if any of this kind of thing really took place back then.  I learned alot about farming and days when automobiles weren't around.  It was a great read, and an unexpected surprise.
0930289234|5.0|This book has gotten raving reviews due to its orignal look into the mind of the caped crusaders, keeping in mind that non of these have any powers of any kind, and most are troubled people with diferent views on the world, im still facinated by this novel, along with kindgdom come..wich is a bit diferent, but i still think if you have never read a graphic novel before Watchmen is a great way to start, not to mention that my profesor at college used this book to have an in depth look at how we see our world and how many ways we can look at it.
1400032717|4.0|This is, for the most part, a daring and successful attempt at writing a story from the perspective of a 15 year old autistic boy.  The first two-thirds of the book are fantastic, and the reader comes to care for Christopher and his quest.  However, the last third of the novel peters out and becomes predictable and even a little flat; but Haddon deserves four stars for a generally wonderful story
B0001UL7RY|5.0|The Avril on this album is heartbroken, confused, angry, in love, melancholy, and a bit jaded. Avril penned all of the songs on this album, making it more intimate. The best thing about Avril's album is its realness. The songs themselves are not over-produced, synthesized tunes. If you listen closely, you hear guitars, piano, violins, drums, etc. That makes Avril unique because everything I've picked up lately has been so...fake.<br />The songs are a bit more mature than her 1st album. They're a bit diverse, making Avril a chamelon. Her songs fit every mood. Angsty(&quot;Take Me Away&quot;, &quot;Freak Out&quot;), retrospective(&quot;My Happy Ending&quot;, &quot;Together&quot;, &quot;Nobody's Home&quot;), and sad(&quot;Slipped Away&quot;).<br />5 stars all the way.
0312995423|3.0|This book came before The Da Vinci Code and Angels &amp; Demons, however it has a seperate cast and main character.  Also, since it's from earlier in Dan Brown's carreer, it feels less solid than the other two books.<br />It's got the same code breaking theme as the other two books, but differs in that fact that it has zero religious content.<br />As I said, it's an older book, and it feels less solid than the other two... I felt like it was good, but there was one or two parts that felt a little anti-climatic.  I mean, with The Da Vinci Code, I never said &quot;Oh that could have been done better&quot;, but with Digital Fortress I thought it a couple times...<br />MY BOTTOM LINE:<BR>If you can't get enough code breaking mysteries, check it out.  But let it off easy because it's definetly a step down from the high bar set by The Da Vinci Code and Angels &amp; Demons<br />~Danny
B0001O3YD0|1.0|I am a huge fan of Pitch Black.  This is one of the greatest reasons I purchased the special edition.  Big mistake.  You can save alot of money if you just buy the original on DVD.  This is by far the worst &quot;Special Edition DVD.&quot;  I have ever encountered.  The Bonus Features are on average about 1 minute long.  The Picture quality is the same and the missing scenes are nothing you would care about missing.  I can just see some big wig saying &quot;hey let's just throw together this movie with a few commercials for the game, upcoming movie and 20 seconds of making of footage and make a quick buck off these sucker fans of ours.&quot;  Even the &quot;Encycolopedia&quot; is an outright insult to anyone.  Poorly done, this narrated encycolopedia has 3-4 concept art sketches and lasts about 20 seconds.  RETARDED AND A HUGE DISSAPOINTMENT.  Definately buy this movie...just not the Special Edition if you dont have to.  Vin Diesel-your new game is awesome but how could you let them do this...  Its like spitting in our faces.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|Alot of people are going to take this CD, give it 2 or 3 listens, and say to themselves &quot;What is this, this isn't a Slipknot record ?&quot;, but really this is what Slipknot wants to be doing otherwise they wouldn't be doing it. You have to listen to it a few times over and get a real feel for what it is supposed to be and not just expect another self-titled. To me Iowa was trying to be another self-titled and that's why it fell short, their main emphasis on the first to records was to blow everyone away and burn their mark into the world, which they did. Now they have decided on sort of a new medium which is more melodic, but still has some of those elements of what the band used to be. I personally loved this album because since I bought Iowa I have been listening to a more variety of music, but there are always going to be people so stuck on the metal aspect of Slipknot that they think they fell off just for chainging to a style they don't agree with. If they wanted to be more radio friendly they wouldn't be in genre that accounts for the least amount of listeners. Plus why the hell would Slipknot have to be radio friendly. If you don't know who they are by now either you don't care about the industry or your freaking stupid. There are alot of bands out there that are pursuing what Slipknot used to be, and I'm sure with the influence they put into many young musicians they will be many more. But this is what Slipknot wants to be doing now, and if you can't accept that then your not a fan.
B00008S2VG|5.0|When I first heard Madonna was bringing out a new album, I was expecting it to be much along the themes of her previous work with Mirwais, stemming on from Die Another Day. Boy was I wrong! This album is personal, insightful... a whole other layer of Madonna's persona.<br />1. American Life - This song is fantastic. It combines folk, rap, electronica and pop, and the result is a song that makes you think, feel and above all, dance. 8/10<br />2. Hollywood - This track has the sweet tweetering of birds as an intro, as it breaks into a funky beat that makes you just wanna sing along. Talking of the woes of Hollywood, this track is another winner. 7.5/10<br />3. I'm So Stupid - One of the weaker tracks on the album, this song carries on the same theme of &quot;Candy Perfume Girl&quot; from Madonna's 1998 album Ray Of Light. Though still great in many ways, the vocoder in this song can get quite irritating at times. Great simplistic lyrics though. 5/10<br />4. Love Profusion - Sweet song with some great effects thrown in. A great tune with a infectious beat, this song is guarenteed to get under your skin. 7/10<br />5. Nobody Knows Me - Not one of my favorites on the album. I'm not too big on the use of the vocoder in this one either. Although its a nice change from many of the songs on the album, as it is much more upbeat. Very electronically influenced. 6/10<br />6. Nothing Fails - This song is so sweet. Many people interperate a religous theme in this song, but I imagine it to be a song about change. About meeting someone who effects you so much, that your whole being changes. The only complaint with this track is that Madonna's vocals could have sounded a bit richer. But overall, great song. 9/10<br />7. Intervention - This to me, is the maternal side of Madonna coming out. My interpretation of this song, is Madonna singing it to both of her kids. And even Guy. A very sweet love song about love holding people together. 7/10<br />8. X-Static Process - I have to admit,this song doesn't do much for me. I know the lyrics are very personal to Madonna, and some of them are great, but it comes accross to me as being a bit all over the place. She sounds great though, with the acoustic guitar, and her full voice. Very different to anything she's done before. 6/10<br />9. Mother And Father - Another deeply personal song. This one has a fantastic beat, with Madonna talking about her mother's death and how it has affected her. A song of renewal, with Madonna saying she feels she needs to let go of the pain her mother's death bought her. 9/10<br />10. Die Another Day - My favorite track on the album. Absolutely love it. Great music, great lyrics, great film clip. Absolutely perfect! 10/10<br />11. Easy Ride - Another folky song, with Madonna talking about the need to acheive success and prosperity, but the yearing to work for everything she has, and to not have it just handed to you. Great electronic sounds in this one. 8/10<br />So as you can see, I am quite a Madonna fan. That however, doesn't make me like everything she's done. But in my opinion, this album is a winner!
B00020HEL6|5.0|I saw Renee perform on the Today Show and I ordered the CD right away. She is 14, but you cannot hear her youth in her voice. Jazz comes quite naturally to her and it comes across in this CD. I love it!
B000002LND|5.0|If you are looking for an essential album, this is definately IT!. Far superior to 2001's GHV2, The Immaculate Collection not only packs all of Madonna's best songs from 1983-1991, but includes two fabulous new tracks, both of which went on to be hits. This is the Madonna we know and love... Amazing cd.
B0000DCGT5|1.0|The amount of times I laughed (or even smiled) during this movie was more than offset by the number of times I cringed. With Pie 1 and 2, I never seriously thought: \\"Maybe I should just turn it off.\\" With this movie, I wanted to quit watching many times. In hindsight, I wish I would've. The problems:<br />HEART<BR>All it takes is one movie without Christ Klein's character (who balanced out some of the stupidity in the earlier films) and something becomes obvious. This movie doesn't stand up well at all. It comes off more like some bad Saturday Night Live skit crafted by a kid who just learned his expletives. The lack of a character like Klein's is a big reason why. Not having his or his girlfriend's character (or Tara Reid's) hurts big time. In the first two movies, there was crassness but still some heart. Taking out the characters who balanced things and all your left with is stupidity with some minor platitudes thrown in (mostly from Jim's dad in this movie). They have all the effectiveness of listening to headphones during a car crash. Which leads me to...<br />STIFLER<BR>Specifically, there's too much of him. Actually, I think he's worse--especially in the movie's early stages--in this one than the other two combined. Admittedly, his overall shtick has a level of entertainment value. But in this movie, they didn't hit it. You wish he would just drop dead.<br />THE CONTRIVED SCENARIOS<BR>How many flippin' gross outs does one movie need? They aren't even funny any more. The scene with Stifler, the cake, Jim, and the dogs is so contrived, you're almost embarrassed for all involved. The scene in the gay bar--besides being unconvincingly set up--goes on forever: You chuckle at the initial silly dance moves he does, but then it just goes on and one and on and on. And Finch and Stifler's mom again to cap the movie? In the second movie this seemed a little tacked on. The third time...yeesh. And that's not even the worst part...<br />THE STRIPPER SCENE<BR>This too goeson forever. And it comes off about as convincing as the silicone breasts that grace the screen. Everyone involved with this scene should be ashamed (it's a sad day when this is the best they could come up with). I was particularly appalled at the involvement of the actors who play Jim's future in-laws--Does everyone have to have their faces shoved in breasts? Please...I'm sufficating. I like the female form and all, but this was something beyond cringe-worthy. Watching this scene I felt reminded of one of the reviewer comments for Madonna's Swept Away movie, \\"New ways to express bad need to be invented to accurately describe this.\\"<br />THE WRITING<BR>Okay, here's the painfully obvious truth: Adam Herz (the writer of the Pie series) is out of ideas. This script is the cinematic equivalent of standing up to give a toast at your best friend's wedding, uttering nothing but obscenities, then throwing in a \\"But love can be good,\\" comment with a belch. <br />Overall, this is a sad conclusion to the American Pie series. If you haven't seen it, spare yourself. Go count weeds in your backyard or something. The people involved with this movie have created something not worthy of your time or money.
0679805273|5.0|Having just gotten this book as graduation present from my Mom when I graduated with my Masters Degree.  It takes something like a book by Dr. Seuss to explain the ups and downs of life and the need for individual drive and perseverence.  This book explains it all to you and puts it (life) in perspective.  In some respects I wish I had received it sooner.  Regardless of your education or age level this Graduation speech by the good Dr. Seusss  will inspire you and bring a smile to your face.  Filled with optimism for the future this book is nice reminder that it isn't so easy but you can (and will) make it.
B00006DEFA|5.0|This directors cut that most people have not appreciated is essential to the story that was presented in the theaters in 1984. It further explaines the sexual fantasy's and alcoholic obsessions of the great composers of that era in europe. To make a comparison, Mozart would be best described as a Babe Ruth of his time, very much of a celebrity since music was considered the ultimate talent of that time the way sports and acting is considered today. Like Babe Ruth he was obsessed with many women and his alcohol, and more importantly, he knew how great he really was.
B00000DFSK|5.0|name isn't Bono.  It's Bono Vox wich is IRISH (where the group is from) for (the one with the) good voice!!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|In The Zone marks Britney's transformation into an adult, a transition that should have happened with her third album.<br />In The Zone's many high points include Toxic, Showdown, Everytime, Shadow, Touch of My Hand, Breathe On Me, and Brave New Girl.<br />Breathe On Me in particular really heralds Britney's transformation into a grown woman making mature pop music. The song's heavy dance beat and slinky lyrics ooze maturity and fun.<br />In The Zone bounces back and forth between dance and hip-hop oriented tracks. Though the dance tracks are undeniably stronger than the others, there really isn't a bad song on the album.<br />Overall, this CD is strongly recommended for anyone who likes fun pop music. It's not exactly heavy or thought-provoking, but let's be honest: Everybody likes a fun CD now and then. This is one of the best pop CDs to come out for a long time.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|1st of all. To all the losers that said &quot;oh my god, this sucks, listen to the Cure?&quot; What the Hell? The Cure? OK. I dont really believe all the people that trashed this album even bought it let alone listened to it. People love to get on here and trash albums that are popular. Oooh something is popular, let's trash it because we're cool. Whatever. Its really good. She worked with several different producers on this album, that does have a harder edge on some songs (the producers are the same that have worked with Evanesence(?), Pearl Jam, etc). But she does have some great slower songs as well. Track one reminds me of Going Under (By Evanesence(?), track 3, the single, of course rocks, track 5 is really good, and track 8 is my favorite, but its very hard core, sort of like an anger anthem. I predict either 5, 8, or 12 will be a single. So all you haters out there, go home and wear your black eye liner and listen to the Dead Kennedy's or Insane Clown Posse or whatever ever your version of cool is, and leave this girl alone. She's a 19 year old genious. And if you didnt purchase the album or listened to it, DONT WRITE A BOGUS REVIEW!!!!!
B0001UL7RY|1.0|Har! Lets flame everyone who doesn't agree with us! The fact is, you guys who think  this 19 year old &quot;genius&quot; *cough* is good are complete morons. The fact is, don't mistake lack of talent for genius. I don't even have to listen to this album. I know it sucks. The single was on the radio on the way to school (unfortunantly) and I already know every song on here will be horrible. I agree with antiradio. Listen to some Dream Theater, or Opeth, or Slayer for bands that are much, much more talented than Avril laughasosgah... and don't bash The cure just because MTV doesn't tell you to like them and you can't appreciate them. But anyway, after my little tangent there, my point is she sucks, and always will suck, and should give up and stop giving everyone headaches.
B0000C9ZLD|3.0|After listening to Is This It, I was somewhat pumped for the Strokes' newest release &quot;Room on Fire&quot;. While I enjoyed &quot;Is This It&quot; for its pure unadultered style and catchy riffs, I still felt like I wanted more. In my mind I wanted them to take those catchy riffs and make them more than a repititious background. Simple is beautiful is most cases, but does not satisfy in all. &quot;Room on Fire&quot;, however, is just lipservice to those who bought &quot;Is This It&quot;  or decided to jump on the bandwagon. Therein lies the major problem. I've heard this all before on &quot;Is This It?&quot;. To me there is no new direction and the band just keeps wallowing in its own image. Every song on this album can be traced back to another on &quot;Is This It?&quot;, creating a very redundant feel. While I still enjoyed this album for that reason (I mean, hey, it's got some catchy material), I did not appreciate the continued feel between the two albums. If you liked &quot;Is This It?&quot; and are not too concerned about the lack of change, this album is for you. If you're looking for a radical change or musical evolution, it might be best for you to borrow this from a friend before making up your mind.
B000060P79|2.0|Hey, don't ask me, their the ones who said it...
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I have not yet purchased this cd myself, but have heard all the songs and love them. I think this cd is going to be number one in the charts. So far my favorite song is Dont Tell Me. Its like in each of the songs she tells a little bit about herself. And its really cool. Its like listening to the whole cd you start to learn a little something new about her. I love Avril Lavigne and she deserves to be number 1!!!!
B0000AQVCL|1.0|The only good song on this album is &quot;Cold hard bitch&quot;.  The rest of it totally sucks.  The lyrics in the other songs are as terrible as the gay music.  I mean come on...they put out a kick ass song like cold hard bitch and then pussified the rest of the album...then this guy has a hard on for ranting about DJ's cuz they &quot;spin other peoples songs&quot;...give me a break and save your pussification of an album for nickelback or creed.  Then the song &quot;Timothy&quot; starts out with him again trying to sing a slow ballad which his voice is NOT made to do, and as it cracks while he moans Timothy like a depressed gay lover I almost puked up my lunch.  Thank god I was close to the &quot;next track&quot; button or I probably would have commenced the up-chucking.  This album is an example of why I do not buy CD's anymore and just burn them from others or download free music.  If I could give this disc less than 1-star I would.  Sucks ass.  Don't buy this album.
630512762X|5.0|While the plot of this movie is relatively interesting, this movie is really about two things:<br />First, the lead actors get to do the characters they do best as fully as they know how.  Cage is his typical, neurotic, repressed, and emotionally conflicted self.  Travolta hams it up in the outlandish, larger-than-life way that he often does.  Despite what could be seen as overacting by both the leads, the almost absurd disparity between them is one of central things that makes this movie work.<br />Second, this movie has the most beautiful action sequences of any action movie I have ever seen (excluding epic-type movies, i.e. LOTR, Star Wars, Braveheart, etc.).  This is a film that knows it's an action movie and revels in it.  The cinematography in the fight scenes simultaneously displays the nature of the characters and the intensity of the battle between them.  There are so many moments when you will just delight at the visual art that is every action sequence in this film.  Needless to say, this movie has all the gunfights, fistfights, chases, and large explosions that one would expect in a serious action film.<br />If you like action movies, this is the first one I would recommend.
B00005JLSE|5.0|Wow, what a FUN movie!  Those who will criticize this movie because it shows too much skin have an idealistic view of what an entertainment is.  I've enjoyed numerous musicals from the classics by Lerner&amp;Lowe and Rodgers&amp;Hammerstein to the more recent musicals such as Moulin Rouge and I think Chicago ranks up there with the best of them.  So who cares if it shows a bit of skin here and there.  The question is, do you enjoy it?  I certainly did.  In particular, Richard Gere was quite impressive.  I always thought him to be a no-talent actor, but he proved me wrong in this film.  Just sit down, relax and enjoy the film!  Make sure the kids are elsewhere, though.
B000005IS1|5.0|I ran out and bought this CD the minute it became available. My vinyl version still has the X-rated intro, and John Sinclair babble on the insert. Lester Bangs did his Rolling Stone 13 page review after the fact. I had heard about the band on Kokaine Karma with Dennis Frawley and Bob Rudnick on WFMU from N.J. and had to have it. I later saw them debut in NYC with the Stooges. Nothing about the '5 has ever compared to this album. Seeing them live is no longer an option. But the energy and rock power still lives in this 1st and best album. THIS is heavy metal, this is punk, this is rock at its best.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|to all the people who said this album is soft and not heavy, what album are you listening to?  They sound exactly like the slipknot they have always been.  The only difference is that there are two accoustic tracks, corey doesn't swear as much and he sings a bit more.  As strange as it is to have accoustic tracks on a slipknot cd, they are good songs, try listening to them before you start bashing them.  As for the rest of the album, it kicks ass.  Better drumming, clearer guitar although still as heavy, and nasty solos.  I mean, what the hell is everyone's problem?  God, hippies piss me off.
1881273156|4.0|I learned a very practical lesson from this book: I need to love people in ways they will perceive as love. It sounds simple: I don't give a T-bone steak to my six-month old boy, and I don't give books on engineering to my wife, who loves romantic novels. Yet I am often too selfish to learn what really communicates love.<br />The main point of the book is that ?real? love is a choice, and when exercising that choice, it needs to be done wisely, by loving someone in the manner (?love language?) that communicates love best to that person. And then the feelings will follow, Chapman says, since \\"feelings follow choice.\\"  In contrast, he says, ?falling in love? is spontaneous and often irrational. So the only real romantic love proceeds from choices grounded in duty.<br />I call this book unromantic, and do not mean that completely as criticism. Relationships have significant components of work and sacrifice that are not always romantic. <br />But perhaps Chapman has gone too far.<br />He has de-emphasized the romantic aspects of love so much that he has in effect denied what romantic literature for centuries has taught us, and in fact, what the only Biblical book about romantic love teaches us, too: that falling in love is not an irrational response, but a choice and response based on the qualities perceived in the beloved; that it need not be temporary, but can last, in various forms, through a lifetime; and that it is a reflection of the nature of God and also his relationship to us.<br />The Biblical book to which I refer, of course, is the Song of Solomon. The lovers fall in love because of the qualities they perceive in each other, and the completeness they feel together. That is why the Song is filled with so much mutual praise. It is also filled with feelings of wonder and delight. When the lovers of the Song display such delight on their wedding night, the Creator Himself endorses their feelings, encouraging them to celebrate this love and enjoy it. What Chapmandisdains, the Creator embraces.<br />Chapman says that falling in love is illusory, unreal because it is spontaneous, not arising from duty. The Song of Solomon shows quite the opposite: that romantic love is a wonderful reality; that spontaneity is part of its beauty; and that devotion arises from love, rather than love from duty. Love gives birth to acts of love like ?grace? gives birth to ?works? from love. And neither the acts nor works are diminished because they arise spontaneously and joyfully, with all the feelings lovers have always described. <br />Chapman also says that the beginning of romantic love is mostly self-centered, evidenced in part by no concern for the personal growth of the other. But nothing could be further from the truth. ?In one high bound,? C.S. Lewis writes, ?it has overleaped the massive wall of our selfhood. It has made appetite itself altruistic, tossed personal happiness aside as a triviality, and planted the interests of another in the center of our being.?<br />Imagine two people with no possibility of a natural attraction between themselves reading Chapman's book. Are they to believe that by following his instructions they can create romantic love for each other --not the love God asks us to show towards all, but the romantic love shared only by two? Will romantic love follow their romantic choices?<br />I like some of Chapman's book, but I like the Song of Solomon better. In the final analysis, it is simply more realistic. It doesn't ask me to believe that any two people, unsuitable or not, have the power to create romantic love for each other, if they so choose. On the contrary, the Song encourages us to patiently wait for its arrival, and the special person with whom we will best experience it. And it  suggests that behind my joyful choice of a partner is the Songwriter?s choice of a gift; that love finds me as much as I find it. <br />For the distinction between Christian love for all and romantic love shared by two, The Four Loves by C.S. Lewis is helpful. For the romantic aspects of love, Solomon's Song of Love by Glickman is quite refreshing.
B00009V7RF|2.0|Let me preface this by syaing that I am a huge fan of the Peas.  I have seen them live many times and they always put on a great show.  I also own Behind the Front, which I thought was good, and Bridging the Gap, which I thought was excellent.  I first heard &quot;Hey Mama&quot; on the radio and was turned off immediately by this new sound.  Eventually, however, the track grew on me and I decided to buy the disc and give it a chance.  I thought it was terrible, to put it mildly.  I tried my best to get into it, but it just was not happening.  The Peas have always danced a fine line between feel-good positivity and over-the-top cheesiness.  With this album they have clearly crossed over into ridiculousness.  Now I admit I have been jamming to a lot more &quot;real&quot; underground Hiphop since I began listening to BEP, and this has certainly changed my tastes a bit, but I recognize bad music when I hear it, and this definately fits the bill.  Trying to digest the saccharin sweetness of tracks such as &quot;Let's Get Retarded,&quot; &quot;Smells Like Funk,&quot; and &quot;Latin Girls&quot; gave me a sugar headache of massive proportions.  I mean, could it possibly get any cheesier?  To avoid aural cavities after consumption, I recommend brushing with Outkast at least twice daily and flossing with Freestyle Fellowship regularly.  If you must go the bubblegum Hiphop route, pick up Jurassic 5, Power in Numbers.  It's a five star album that won't leave you nursing a bellyache.
B00006ZCFH|5.0|When I first got erykah's latest album I was soooo impressed. Its too bad the radio wont allow her whole album, or at least more songs too be released. I guess she's too real and true to her people for record company's to allow that. All I can say is she has real talent. Every album she has shows a different part of here personality. You get to peek into here thoughts and ideas a bit. She does'nt write about the same ol things over and over again. I really think she has her own style. She's not trying to be some 70's look alike. She is just being herself. I love her music. What can I say she's a genius. You go Erykah Badu. Alica keys, Beyounce, And India Arie could never have her style class or talent. She is a one of a kind. Peace.
B00008DDXL|5.0|This DVD was magical.  The special effects were awesome.  I have to give a shout out to the director of this movie.  I also would like to thank J.K. Rowling.  Please continue with this great Harry Potter series.  I think you should also start anew with new characters once the series is finished.  Please come out with the 6th book.  The anticipation is making me go insane.  I AM also seeing The Prisoner of Azkaban this weekend!  SEE IT IN THEATERS TO MAKE MONEY FOR THE BRILLIANT MIND OF THE DIRECTOR AND FOR ROWLING.  Ahhh Yes the movie.  IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THIS MOVIE YOU HAVE TO.  YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO.  NO QUESTION.  MAGICAL, GREAT.  UNBELIEVABLY BRILLIANT.
B00005JN0A|2.0|i thought road trip and old school were hilarious, so i checked out eurotrip.  man, i have to say i was disappointed. there were a few moments that made me laugh, but all in all, it's boring, unoriginal, unfunny and slooow.  if you're getting this for the nudity, don't be fooled.  the unrated edition doesn't go any further than brief topless scenes, and they're pretty tame.  the nude beach scene does show frontal, but it's from afar and it's a bunch of guys only. the two main characters, scotty and cooper, are first time actors who tried to be funny but weren't.  the one who plays scotty is a freddie prinz jr. wannabe, and the one who plays cooper is a david spade wannabe.  not to be mean, but i kinda doubt you'll be seeing these guys in many more movies.  so anyways, bottom line is, rent first -- if you really like it, then buy it, since there are alot of bonus materials included (nothing great though), but if you don't like it, then at least you've saved yourself some money.  i'll be selling my copy soon.  peace!
B000099T2L|5.0|I didn't care too much for Beyonce before this solo thing occured. Now I just love her new album and career. It was a good album, something i can just put on and listen to from start to finish, not many albums out there like that! Overall she's proved herself as a very talented artist. She's proved that no matter what lengths people may go through to get u down you can still succeed in life. I wish her the best!!
B000002NJS|5.0|&quot;Ray of Light&quot; blew me away when I first got it in early 1998 and it has remained my favorite Madonna album ever since then and sadly it was to be her last good album because &quot;Music&quot; was a let down and &quot;American Life&quot; isn't even worth buying from a cut-out bin.<br /> The music on here is a lot trancier and much darker than anything she had ever done before then and showcased a much deeper and more emotional side that we had never heard before. <br /> &quot;Substitute For Love&quot; is just a beautiful song. <br /> &quot;Swim&quot; is another entrancing dance track.<br /> The title track is rave-like fun and a great dance club hit.<br /> &quot;Candy Perfume Girl&quot; is a really strange trance like song. <br /> &quot;Skin&quot; is an intoxicatingly haunting and even scary classic.<br /> &quot;Nothing Really Matters&quot; is another great dance track.<br /> &quot;Sky Fits Heaven&quot; is a beautiful fast-paced song.<br /> &quot;Shanti/Ashangti&quot; is a strongly Asian influenced track that is worth a listen.<br /> &quot;Frozen&quot; is a very cold bitter classic. <br /> &quot;The Power of Goodbye&quot; doesn't do much for me. Sorry<br /> &quot;To Have and Not To Hold&quot; is kind of boring in my opinion.<br /> &quot;Little Star&quot; is a hauntingly beautiful rave-like song with a strange sound to it. <br /> &quot;Mer Girl&quot; is very spooky and ends the album on a strange note. <br /> And so you have it. Sadly, this is Madonna's last great album because almost everything that she has released has dissapointed me in every way. Get this album. It's really great!
0440180295|5.0|I always have mixed feelings when discussing Vonnegut.  Some of his works are fascinating, fun, and ultimately moving (&quot;Sirens of Titan&quot;) and some are flat, off-putting attempts at juvenile sarcasm (&quot;Cat's Cradle&quot;).<br />There's no doubt where &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; falls.  It's not only his most powerful work, but the best distillation of the Vonnegut world-view:<br />(you can almost hear him spitting venom between clenched teeth) &quot;Life sucks.  People suck.  History sucks.  What a laughable mess this human race is.  What an absurd excuse for existence.&quot;<br />(short pause)<br />&quot;...but there are so many nice things to see and do along the way.&quot;<br />It's that powerful moment of recognition of beauty that ultimately redeems all the pain and humiliation of life, and nowhere has Vonnegut so clearly and forcefully driven this concept home.  The novel is stunning and heartfelt.  He makes full use of his now well-honed ironic style (purposefully monotonous prose that sends banality into the realm of dark comedy) and sends his hapless hero, Billy Pilgrim, on a weird and disorienting journey through time and space, as well as to exorcise his own demons from the war.  <br />It's a pity that science fiction is so poorly regarded in this country.  Otherwise this novel would be considered one of the great anti-war statements of our time.  <br />Because, as Vonnegut puts it, there really is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre.  It's best to let the birds have the last word.
B00005JMEW|4.0|Once again Tarantino sticks to his knack, violence, insanity, twisting story lines, irony, hyperbole. Can I say anything more? Would you want me to ruin it for you?  Of course not.  Buy it, if you're so inclined, rent it if you wish.  Excuse my lack of Netiquette IT'S A TARANTINO MOVIE!!!!  Read the others if you want the complete picture... I didn't read any reviews and I'm glad I didn't.  It made the watching, so much more exciting.
B00000JGEH|4.0|I got hundreds of 'em.  VHS tapes, collected over the years when VHS was cool.  I was digging through them the other day and, to my delight and surprise, rediscovered THE TERMINATOR, a great action thriller that put director James Cameron and &quot;Ahnold&quot; on the superstar map.<br />Schwarzenegger is absolutely perfect as an unemotional cyborg that travels back in time to 1984 to &quot;terminate&quot; a young woman (Linda Hamilton) destined to give birth to a man who ultimately will lead humans against the machines of the 21st Century.  Arnold brings his &quot;A&quot; game to this role, effectively portraying a brutal, stoic, ruthless killing machine that will stop at nothing to achieve its mission.  Hamilton as the constantly running victim is very good at screaming and looking terrified, while Michael Biehn is solid as her futuristic &quot;protector.&quot;<br />As entertaining as this movie is, the special effects are dated and quite laughable by today's standards.  Equally as laughable are the hairstyles, including a brief appearance by a spike-haired Bill Paxton.  Yet the flaws are overcome by the action and nonstop thrills, as Cameron showed the world he is a filmmaker to be reckoned with.  And I reckon I'm darn glad to have THE TERMINATOR in my video collection.<br />--D. Mikels

B0000BYM3K|5.0|Now a lot of die hard iron maiden fans probably dislike this because they have mellowed out, but i find it for the better. There is a lot of talent in the cd, especially with all of the orchestra. you can tell from the cd that iron maiden have matured their music with this cd. my favorite song on the cd is &quot;Face in the Sand&quot; because of the double bass and the strings in it. my other favorites are no more lies, paschendale, and journeymen. the only thing i dislike about the cd is it kind of sounds like songs that'd be on a disney movie. that's ok though. if you enjoy really technical music then buy this cd. don't buy this if you like hair metal because this is not hair metal. i would suggest buying fear of the dark if you like hari metal
0312263120|5.0|This was an excellent read.  Weaved in this tantalizing tale about the NSA facing an unbreakable code is clever writing filled with continuous mental teases that make the page turns unnoticeable.  The United States Government has the duty to protect its citizens.  How far must they go and can we trust them?  How much freedom are we willing to give up in exchange for our safety?  What is reasonable?  While pondering these questions that are very real concerns among us today, I cannot help but admire how Dan Brown depicts this ongoing issue in fiction.  The quest for dominance and full reign although seemingly for a noble cause can lead to destruction.  In the hands of mortals tainted by the frailties of humanity supreme power can kill the innocent and leave those left behind with no protection at all.  I will encourage anyone with an interest in reading to take a thrilling ride through \\"Digital Fortress\\".  Inside you will find revenge, deception, action, suspense, greed, obsession, lust and above all love......\\"without wax\\".

B0001UL7RY|5.0|This CD I freaking bad a**. One or two song lyrics dont have some meaning, but the music makes up for it and blows it up! Yeah!!!!!
B0000024JN|5.0|I still like the Beastie Boys' \\"Licensed to Ill\\" today!  I played that tape over and over on a bus trip to Florida in April of 1987 during spring break!  The lyrics are still funny!  They mention White Castle hamburgers on just about every song that it's so funny!  White Castle's sales must have tripled in 1986-1987 because of the Beasties'numerous mentions of them.  Mike D, King Ad Rock and MCA were some funny fellows from Brooklyn on this album. The basslines on \\"Posse In Effect\\", \\"Slow And Low\\",\\"Slow Ride\\", \\"Hold It Now\\", \\"Time To Get Ill\\", \\"The New Style,\\" \\"Brass Monkey\\" and others have this smoothness to them and have you dancing in a sleazy and sneaky way! And have you moving your hands in crazy, wild directions too!   I still dance to them today the same way at 34 than I did at 17! This was raw, no-nonsense hip-hop here and they really pulled it off!  It's still catchy today!  And the rock-based numbers \\"Rhymin' and Stealin\\", \\"Fight For Your Right to Party\\" and \\"No Sleep Til Brooklyn\\" are still solid, proving the Beasties could rap over loud rock guitars! Girls is so funny for its short 2 minutes and dorky music.  A year before '86, they were the opening act on Madonna's tour.  This album really made them big stars and that's why they're more in demand today for tours!  Their new single from their upcoming 2004 album is so funky!  They still have it a strong 2 decades later!!!!!!!  \\"Licensed To Ill\\" is still a classic and still funny and funky today!

B0001I55OC|1.0|What could be duller and more pointless than the 100 years war? Perhaps making a film about a group of archaeologists who time travel to fourteenth century France.<br />  The originality of this film is that it is so lacking in an original idea. We have been to this place before in the much more interesting and creative `Stargate'.  That film took us on a real adventure to a place where all Earth's history was born and where a force of evil spawned the early gods.<br />  In `Timeline' we get to visit a grimy pointless war at the close of the dark ages with a group of myopic and expendable characters.  What is the outcome? It is a predictable story that limps along to a forgone conclusion, a waste of talent and celluloid.<br />  What could be worse than that? Bad acting and worse writing is the answer and it is served to perfection in this oeuvre of trash.  The failure of the film begins with the writing and then segues into the lifeless direction. Richard Donner has never surpassed his pedestrian work on 1978's `Superman'. It all finally comes to a thudding stop at what is referred to as acting.<br />  Paul Walker is not an actor without talent. He was superb in \\"Pleasantville\\" and hit all the right notes in \\"The Fast And The Furious\\". Yet here he squanders his good looks and talent on bad writing and dull direction. Billy Connolly who was so brilliant in `Mrs. Brown' is the one of two who comes off with any grace in this misfire. The other who escapes with little damage is Gerard Butler who is always impressive. He takes some very bad dialog and improbable situations and turns them to his advantage.<br />  The high school senior year acting class honors however to to Francis O'Connor. Is it the writing that makes her so bad? Almost anyone would have a struggle with such howling lines to read. Perhaps it is a lack of experience. No, that can't be it. She has done some fine work in the past from `Mansfield Park' to `A.I.'. I finally figured out what bothered me so about her in `Timeline'. Its the strangest thing, almost spooky in fact, is the casting of this young actress who looks like she went to a plastic surgeon and asked to be made to look like a middle aged Barbara Hershey. This is what kept me riveted to the screen throughout the unfortunate experience. I was fascinated at the creepiness of the resemblance between the young Francis O'Connor and older and very preserved Miss Hershey.<br />  Now there is an idea for a science fiction film. An aging actress from the 60's has herself cloned so that her image may go on in films making bad choices and worse films for eternity. That is until someone from the past shows up in a time machine and puts an end to the endless dry rot. Come to think of it, has anyone seen Barbara Hershey lately? It's too spooky!Timeline'.

B00009W0WM|5.0|The suave Bogart, the luminous Bergman, the slimy Raines, the tuneful Wilson all meet at Rick's Caf&eacute; American in Warner Brothers classic of all time, Casablanca.  This film is a wonder of cinema and well deserves the first class treatment on this DVD issue.<br />  Thought by many to be the best film or at least the most popular film of all time it is indeed a wonderful movie replete with danger, intrigue and romance.<br />  I will not go through the history of the making of the film but rather leave the discovery of that up to you. There are two wonderful documentaries on this DVD, which will unfurl the fascinating history of Casablanca.<br />  Bogart in this film made his mark as a screen icon with his multifaceted portrayal of Rick. His craggy face and world-weary eyes fill the screen with full star wattage. He is the commanding center around which all the other characters revolve. It is impossible to imagine anyone else in this role. But there were a few other contenders. Thank god or at least Jack Warner that they went with Boggy in the process made him a star.<br />  Ingrid Bergman is compelling and beautiful in her anti Hollywood 40's glamour.  She is so natural in the role of Ilsa that she draws you into the world of the film with her tender and desperate performance. When the camera holds her lovely face in full frame, is there a more beautiful face in the entire world?<br />  Dooley Wilson as Sam the piano player takes a thankless sidekick and fills him with humanity and warmth. And of course as time goes by, he play's it again.<br />  The delicious Claude Raines sparkles with wit and chicanery in his role as the chief of Police Renault. It is pure joy to watch this, one of Hollywood's greatest character actors in his best-remembered role.<br />  The cast is rounded out by a who's who of the Warner Brother's A-1 character actors; Paul Henreid, Sidney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre top this list.<br />  The biggest star of the film is the script by the Epstein brothers, Julius and Philip. It is tight, razor sharp and witty. The script of any film is its foundation. Without the writers you have nothing. With Casablanca you get a perfect film script.<br />  The direction by veteran Michael Curtiz is among his best work. The music by Max Steiner is top-notch example of film music from the golden age. The rousing songs are by M.K. Jerome and Jack Scholl, \\"Knock On Wood\\".

B00015TOCY|5.0|&quot;Taking Tiger Mountain&quot; has all the trappings of glam rock thrown into a blender full of prog rock. The results gets your attention with its glitter surface but stays with you long after the musical meal is finished. Although not Eno's best album, it's a strong follow up to &quot;Here Come the Warm Jets&quot;. Eno works with the usual suspects here including his former Roxy Music cohorts Phil Manzanera (guitar)and Paul Thompson (drums) as well as Robert Fripp, Robert Wyatt and--gasp--Phil Collins (well, he was after all still in Genesis at this stage and it was before he found his second career as a radio staple). Imagine King Crimson crossed with Roxy Music with a hint of Zappa and Beefheart (and, yes, The Beatles) thrown in for good measure and you'll have an idea as to what this album sounds like.<br />The production by Rhett Davies (Roxy Music's &quot;Avalon&quot; among many others) and Eno combines the atmospheric texture and sound of his first great album with some really odd, angular melodies. This isn't as catchy nor but it is as funny as &quot;Jets&quot; with its odd, off beat lyrics (you'll discover if you don't already know that Eno uses lyrics for the sound they make together vs. any inherent meaning to them). Nonsense lullabies these aren't by any stretch of the imagination.<br />&quot;Burning Airlines Give You so Much More&quot; breaks the dam open with it's odd, Asian sounding guitar riff. It sets the pace for the rest of the album--strange strangled guitar riffs delievered like the best comedy bits--straight faced. No problems with the sound here and, unlike &quot;Another Green World&quot;, none of the discs have missing words, music etc. that I can tell.
B000067IZ3|3.0|&quot;TRAFFIC&quot; is three interwoven stories about the drug trade and its impact on people.  It attempts toshows how drugs can affect everybody connected to the drug dealers and pushers eg. family.  It works in a way, but not enough to make me feel empathy for the characters.<br />It's fast moving and engaging, but something is missing from this film. Big names like Zeta Jones and Douglas aren't enough to make the film great.<br />If you really want to see a film that tackles the subject really well but in a different light, may I suggest &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot;.  The devastation of drugs is well told in this film.
B00022M518|5.0|\\"Here Comes the Warm Jets\\" stands as one of Eno's best solo albums. Later he would venture into more ambient territory but here Eno rocks out with a vengence. \\"Baby's on Fire\\" with Fripp's stuttering guitar solo is one of the stand out breaks. While Eno never had a great voice, he does a pretty good job overall singing the material. His singing improved greatly with each successive album.<br />Although the remastered/reissued edition doesn't have any bonus tracks, I'd recommend it over this edition. The DSD remastered sound captures much more detail, depth and, well, ambience than the originally issued CD. This isn't a bad mastering job, it's just dated sounding compared to more recent reissues.
B00005B36H|5.0|A very large number of people have praised this record, and they do so very correctly. I'm not going to disect the music on this record; That is not the spirit of this very spirtiual band, nor would I have any new perspective to add to the considerable litany of views previously expressed (The Grudge is the best song on the record, by the way). <br />READ THIS PART: Basically, I'm here to talk about Track 13, Voice of God, whatever the name of it is. This was a caller to the Art Bell radio show on (everyone, look at the date...) September 11, 1997. That date seems like an extraordinarily eerie coincedence, considering he is talking about &quot;all the disasters that are about to happen&quot;. I really, really, really would like to hear from anyone who has any more information about this. I've read the Bob Frissell books (memorized them, actually), and I would just really like to hear from anyone who either has info about this (was it a hoax? did Art Bell ever say if it was legit or not?) or has an opinion about this. My email is lastamericanliberal@hotmail.com.  Thank you much<br />Peace, Love, Empathy..
B00022M518|5.0|\\"Here Comes the Warm Jets\\" announced Eno's intention from the first track; make groundbreaking, melodic music in the Roxy Music vein. The irony is that, for all intents and purposes, this was Eno's version of Roxy Music. If he were the lead vocalist, main songwriter in the band this is the material he'd be putting out there. It makes a great companion piece to Roxy's third album \\"Stranded\\". Ferry and Eno, in retrospect, compliment each other very, very well. As Ferry himself stated, he now wishes they had kept Eno and added Eddie Jobson. I couldn't agree more.<br /><br />The improved sonics are the chief reason to pick this up. The detail is better, clarity is better (even on a cheap stereo) and the warmth and atmosphere of the original recording becomes evident from the first guitar chord. The packaging is another matter entirely. I like the digipak design but do wish that there were some comments from Eno and his band mates about the making of this classic album. The reproduction of the original artwork seems pretty darn close to the original vinyl version for the most part.<br /><br />From the stuttering Robert Fripp guitar solo for \\"Baby's On Fire\\" to the odd chord progression of \\"Driving Me Backwards\\", every track manages to capture your attention. This is Eno's candy store and he's displaying all his sweet wares for the first time. Later albums would focus on other elements but here his talent burst forth in full flower.<br /><br />Another minor complaint--where is \\"Seven Deadly Finns\\" and the material from Eno's only charting EP? It would have made a perfect addition to this album (even if it was released as a two disc set keeping the original albums intact and separate). It's a pity. Still, the DSD technique for transferring these priceless recordings captures the vibrant sound and impact of the original recordings without the sterile atmosphere of CD. Well worth picking up.
B0001US8FI|5.0|So here it is... more than 30 years since the original theatrical release of Enter the Dragon, Warner Brothers releases the definitive 2 DVD Special Edition. It's a fine offering, long overdue, and considering the reasonable price, really offers a lot of nice extras, though most of them have been available elsewhere and have therefore been seen before (at least by rabid fans like me). <br />To start with, there is of course the movie Enter the Dragon (ETD) - Bruce Lee's magnum opus that was not released until after his unfortunate death in 1973, but sealed his immortality. The plot is simple enough - Bruce is a modern day Shaolin monk who is somehow enlisted by the British/Hong Kong government to infiltrate the island of Dr. Han (Shieh Kien), a crusty old renegade Shaolin gone bad who holds a yearly martial arts tournament to recruit talent for an international opium and prostitution racket. Roper (John Saxon), or \\"Loper\\" as Bruce says his name, is the established Hollywood caucasian star brought in because of reservations about Bruce's ability to carry the film, while Williams (Jim Kelly) is the token blaxploitation character who, this being the 70's, is kind of a Shaft/Superfly ass-kicker and, in the spirit of horror movies, is the first to die at the hand of Han - actually, at his artificial, interchangeable, iron, and oftentimes bladed hand. Even Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung, as young Hong Kong stuntment before they became stars in their own right, make infamous appearances as guys on the receiving end of Bruce's wrath. But the real point, or value, of this movie is that Bruce Lee shines throughout with his incredible fight sequences - he once again casts Bob Wall as whipping boy, hitting him with lightning fast punches, an insane skip side kick, and a great groin shot that still makes me wince despite hundreds of viewings; he has some fantastic weapons sequences with staff, double escrima sticks, and nunchaku; and he more than lives up to his reputation as the \\"man with three legs\\" as he demolishes armies of scrawny Asian guys whose gung fu is pitiful in comparison (check out the guy laughing in the background as Bruce connects three successive roundhouse kicks to one sap's head in the final mob fight). This was totally innovative and amazing in 1973 as the first ever martial arts movie made in Hollywood and despite all the subsequent copycats and modern day wire-fu flicks, no one has ever matched Bruce's intensity, charisma, and moves. There are some classic dramatic sequences as well with Bruce speaking English in his own voice (unlike all of his Hong Kong movies whose English versions are horribly dubbed), such as Bruce teaching a student and rapping him on the head as he expounds some homespun Zen philosophy or Bruce poignantly asking \\"why doesn't someone just pull a .45 and settle it?\\" Incidentally, this is the uncut version of the movie with some extra scenes not included in the theatrical release - basically Bruce talking quasi-philosophy (well, actually, it's someone else dubbing in Bruce's voice) with his Shaolin elder that he later recalls in the final fight sequence. <br />Of course, few people who buy this DVD don't know all this already, so what's new? Well, there is a commentary track by producers Paul Heller and Fred Weintraub - there's some interesting tidbits, but overall it's disappointingly uninspired. Then there's \\"Blood and Steel: The Making of Enter the Dragon\\" - a newly produced documentary short that includes some rare and new footage - a clip from Bruce's Hong Kong TV appearance in which he breaks 4 dangling boards; an interview with John Saxon, Lalo Schifrin, and the kid who gets smacked on the head by Bruce in the movie (now apparently a well-known Hong Kong director); and several minutes of on-location footage shot with Ahna Capri's handheld Super 8 camera that has never been seen before (it's short of amazing, but it's new and therefore gold to diehard fans). On disc 1 there's also a soporific Linda Lee (Cadwell) interview, another \\"making of\\" featurette with on-location footage shot by the AD, John Little's short \\"In His Own Words\\" featuring most of the Pierre Burton interview, and some old black and white movies (with sound) of Bruce kicking his buddies and hitting his heavy bag in his Los Angeles backyard - though these have all been previously available in one place or another (including the 25th Anniversary ETD DVD).<br />Disc 2 includes all of the TV and theatrical trailers for the movie (somewhat repetitive) and two previously released Warner Brothers documentaries - Warrior's Journey, which captures and knits together the lost Game of Death footage (GOD) in its available entirety, and Curse of the Dragon, a George Takei (Sulu of Star Trek fame) narrated documentary released around the time of Brandon Lee's death. These are both decent films, with Warrior's Journey a real gem with the GOD footage - the definitive way to watch Bruce in widescreen duel nunchakus with Dan Inosanto and try to deconstruct Kareem Abdul Jabbar's fighting style while sporting the iconic yellow and black tracksuit revived by Uma Thurman in Kill Bill Vol 1.  Curse of the Dragon is interview heavy (Kareem, Taky Kimura, Paul Heller, James Coburn, etc.) but also includes clips from Bruce's childhood movies, his Green Hornet screen test, his appearance at Ed Parker's Long Beach Karate touurnament, and some backyard work-out footage with Coburn.  But once again, these films have already been released before on their own, so while decent, they're less than revelatory.<br />And so, what we have here is by far the best available version of ETD that now exists and probably ever will, complete with a lot of nice extras, most of which have been available elsewhere. It's nice to have it all in one package (there's no apparent need to sell Warrior's Journey as a standalone product anymore) at a reasonable price. On the other hand, Lee worshippers will no doubt wish that there was more - why not include the complete Green Hornet screen test, or a Jim Kelly or Jackie Chan interview or commentary track, the complete James Coburn training session footage, all of the Ahna Capri film, more ETD outtakes, or maybe even \\"Kentucky Fried Movie,\\" a parody of ETD released many years ago... but what can you do - Bruce died 31 years ago and this is the legacy he left behind.
0739308726|3.0|I loved the first two books and forgive the occasional cliche scenes and support characters because of the pace and atmosphere he keeps up.<BR>But...in this latest book, too many (potential hero) characters are not in control of their own destinies for far too long, drifting with the tide of events and losing all my interest as they do so.<BR>It seems like he is padding out many of the key players because he isnt ready for them to make their mark till later in the series, probably after the Dragons return to the mainland.<BR>There is still time to pull it back but I am waiting for the next book with uneasy anticipation, fingers crossed.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  The acting performances are strong, the story well paced, and the imagery compelling.  I have not read the book (yet!), so I cannot speak to issues of interpretation.  As a stand-alone experience, I was captivated by the blurring of the line dividing fantasy from reality.  You're never quite sure what to make of anything, and while some have viewed the ending as a 'surprise', I found it to be another riddle.  Certainly some validation of the father's tall tales becomes evident, but how much?  This is an entertaining movie that will generate some interesting discussions amongst your cinematic friends.  Enjoy!
B00003CXC7|5.0|Jimmy Stewart is L.B. Jeffries, an action photographer who is laid up with his leg in a cast to his waist after getting too close to an automobile racing accident.  From the rear window of his New York apartment &quot;Jeff&quot; can see the going's on of many of his neighbors - &quot;Miss Lonelyhearts&quot;, a middle-aged lady who seems unlucky in love,  &quot;The Songwriter&quot; who plunks at his studio piano trying to come up with a hit, &quot;Miss Torso&quot; the dancer who entertains many men in between stretching her lithe body across the courtyard from our vantage-point.<br />Jeffries also has a girlfriend, a socialite named Lisa Fremont who is played by Grace Kelly, and the Princess never looked more beautiful or graceful than in this film.  Her introduction into the movie is, in my humble opinion, the most beautiful &quot;close-up&quot; ever done, and when she kisses Jimmy Stewart how many men have wished that it were them?<br />OH! Did I mention there is a spine-tingling mystery story mixed in with all of the above?  One of Jeffries neighbors is Lars Thorwald, played by Raymond Burr, who has an invalid wife who nags and belittles him.  One day the wife is gone.  Has she just gone on a visit?  Or has Mr. Thorwald had enough and done her in?  I won't answer that question, but I promise you'll be on the edge of your seat more than once as you find out.  There is more than one scene where the suspense is almost unbearable.<br />Thelma Ritter is in several scenes as the home-health nurse who comes to look in after the immobilized Jeffries, and she steals all of her scenes with her witty and morbid sense of curiosity.<br />The restoration and transfer of the film to DVD looks great, and the extras are informative and probably about as much &quot;extra material&quot; as could be put together here 4 decades after the fact.<br />Hitchcock made dozens of films, and many of them are considered among the very best ever made.  This is one of those.  Only recommended for those who really want to be entertained.or those who really want to be entertained.
B00008EY65|1.0|this movie sucks.  action is unevenly spaced and all hellboy does is run around with his stupid one liners every time he fights.  this is just schwarznegger or steven segal all decked out in red.  gimme a break.
B0001FR3IQ|1.0|dark castles has had a bad past for putting out horror movies with over made computer graphic creatures, shakey plots, and good-looking woman with cues to scream, and show skin, disbelieving in the actuall acting talents they're suppose to give. Instead they go to the cgi graphics. dressing the movie up. In the opening credits I saw joel silver...mixing the producer of the matrix movies, and dark castles which helped put out movies like house an haunted hill, the haunted, and 13 ghosts -- it's the oil and water mix at it's worst. The elements are very watered down and over done!! if you like computer generated horror movies that make up more than 40% of the movie you might like it, but if you're a classic horror lover you might not like it.
0393324818|5.0|I have been a &quot;roto geek&quot; for a number of years now, so I have understood and appreciated the use of on-base-percentage as an important tool for judging the future production of ball players.  Yet, I really had no idea!<br />That was until I read Moneyball!  This book details the organizational structure of the Oakland A's, which is a team that is forced plays on a severely strapped budget.  Yet, they continue to win.  Basically, Oakland adheres to a philosophy of drafting college players that get on base, via the walk.  This shows that the player has a god control of the strike zone and will most likely be able to hit on a professional level. This allows for Oakland to find value, in the market for players, that other teams have ignored.  <br />This philosophy not only incorporates strong statistical analysis of players, it also takes a new way of seeing baseball.  That is look not at what a player might be able to do, but look at what they have done!  Read this book (which can easily be done in one or two sittings) and you will see baseball in a completely different light, you will be happy you did!
078322799X|5.0|This is one of those well done movies that balances several genres into a single story.  On the one hand, you have Bannister's (Fox) tragic character who never fully got over the death of his wife.  And his grief has made him pretty self destructive, so he's fallen from a successful and wealthy architect to a con-man living in his own, half-finished masterpiece.  On the flipside of this are his partners in crime, the ghosts who scare Bannister's potential clients into hiring him in the first place.  The humor gets pretty bizarre at times, but actually balances very well with the other story elements.  Things go from grim, to funny, and back again just when they should.  The third angle is the almost gothic and equally bizarre horror element to the story, where the ghost of a dead serial killer shows up as the bad guy.  Bannister, the broken down wreck who can barely keep himself together is the only one who can see the killer.  Yet even he's powerless to stop his enemy.  Even worse, the wonderfully played FBI agent (Jeffrey Combs) has pegged Bannister as the &quot;wacko&quot; killer, though it's clear that the agent is the most deranged of all.  Trini Alvarado does an excellent job as his potential love interest.  She's a little naive, but strong willed.<br />If you like well thought out, thinking man's horror (instead of just the slash'em up variety) and have a dark (or even twisted) sense of humor, you'll like this movie.
B000000LZV|5.0|The Minutemen were an amazing trio from San Pedro, CA. They took rock, jazz, blues and punk, deconstructed it and put it back together again in the most wonderful ways. Though most Minutemen songs were brief, each one is a satisfying composition that will leave you hungry for more. Musically, The Minutemen were like a well-oiled machine. Drummer George Hurley absolutely has to be the tightest drummer I ever witnessed live. Bassist Mike Watt truly is one with his bass. To hear his mastery over the instrument, you can only assume he came out of the womb with it! Singer/guitarist D. Boon's heartfelt, thoughtful lyrics and his commitment to the musical ideals he believed in have always served as an inspiration to me in my own musical endeavors. His honesty, integrity and imagination really helped me to realize what punk rock really meant. D. Boon never seemed like a guitar hero to me. He seemed like an older brother who took you under his wing, imparted words of wisdom upon you and gave you the idea that you were free to listen to anything you wanted, achieve anything you wanted or be anything you wanted to be. D. Boon's senseless, tragic death (he was killed in a car accident) was an unbelievable loss. God bless D. Boon!<br />This imaginative masterpiece was recorded in a relatively short period of time and features 43 cuts (45 on the original vinyl LP) that range in style from punk to country to funk to pretty much all points in-between and they cover such wild stylistic ground so effortlessly! Not one track on the album is a throwaway or a disappointment! Some of my favorite tracks here include \\"Jesus &amp; Tequila\\", \\"This Ain't No Picnic\\", \\"Glory of Man\\" and \\"#1 Hit Song\\" but rest assured, every track is a winner and your particular favorites will probably differ from mine and from anyone else who holds this record near to their heart. Trust me, if you are debating buying this, do so now! This record cannot mean so much to so many people if it wasn't good!
B0001NBMBC|4.0|I can't understand why people are saying that Slipknot has soldout. Sure they have toned it down a hair but they are still heavy. I personally think this is a good album. It's a much big improvement over Iowa which to me sounded like a bunch of noise. I hated that album because I think Corey over did it with the yelling. On this album they have a much more clear sound and Corey isn't over doing it with the vocals. He has a very good singing voice so I think he should use it. Yes there are a couple of slow songs like vermilion parts 1 and 2, but I mean there are 14 tracks on the album for crying out loud. This album has some killer guitar riffs and some good drum beats. So if you are a TRUE Slipknot fan you should really purchase this album. People act like they sold out like Metallica did when they came out with the LOAD and RELOAD albums, come on now. Anyone who says they don't like Slipknot anymore because of this album isn't a true fan anyways. No one can deny that Slipknot is a talented band. I think it is good for a band to change it up and try something different. But I think they really haven't changed that much. This album isn't a classic but it is still very good and I don't think you can go wrong with it. One last note, if you like classic thrash metal and not Nu-metal you should really check out a band called EXHORDER. They kind of sound like a heavier version of PANTERA. Their albums SLAUGHTER IN THE VATICAN and THE LAW are available here at Amazon.com.
B00006RAKP|5.0|This two disc set is fantastic!  It has all the hits that I remember.  Buy the set...you won't regret it!
B0001GOH6Q|3.0|BIG FISH is Tim Burton's most &quot;standard&quot; film to date, and yet it too has many strange eccentricities throughout.  In spite of its wonderful cast and some imaginative vignettes, the movie as a whole is less than satisfying.  Ultimately, I found myself saying &quot;Who cares?&quot;.  Edward Bloom is a larger than life character, indeed, but he avoids reality by creating absurd stories to go along with the events he has experienced.  Thus, the viewer is asked to sympathize and understand a man whose forays into the fantasy world provide him from facing the realities of his family's life.  His son has grown up feeling he has never even known his father, and the movie says that's okay, because the fantasy father was the real father.<br />One can't fault the acting, though.  Helena Bonham Carter is a revelation as the crockety old witch and the young Jenny that falls in love with Bloom.  Alison Lohman looks so much like Jessica Lange, it's perfect casting, and she manages to possess that same dreamy quality Lange offers later.  Billy Crudup does a beautiful job with a thankless character whose destiny of course is to become just like his father.  Matthew McGory as Karl the giant is splendid in a role that could have been pure hokum; his Karl is more human than Edward would ever be.  Jessica Lange has a beautiful scene with Albert Finney in the bathtub, and does well with a poorly developed character.  Finney is brilliant, and deserved a supporting actor nomination.  Unfortunately, Ewan McGregor plays his character on an entirely one-note, bigger than life bravado that undermines the film's strengths.<br />Burton is to be commended for attempting such an original film; I just didn't find it all that interesting.
0780021967|4.0|\\"The 39 Steps\\" will never be called anyone's favorite Hitchcock film.  He had not yet hit his stride, and many of the Hitchcock hallmarks had not yet been developed.  Most famous in this film is the use of the \\"MacGuffin Principle,\\" seen in movies such as \\"Pulp Fiction\\" and \\"The Maltese Falcon.\\"  There is something everyone wants, but what it is isn't really important.  Still, it is an enjoyable movie and worth the time to watch it.<br />The film starts very slow, with an extremely contrived beginning catapulting our wayward protagonist into adventure and mystery.  Robert Donat is very charming as the Canadian Richard Hannay, and he accepts the call to adventure readily.  The trail leads him from England to Scotland, and there the story finally begins to come together.<br />Once in Scotland, Donat schemes and charms his way through an entertaining cast of characters, from the brusque Scotsman and his young bride, willing to sell Donat out for a few pounds, to the classical 4-fingered man, each moves the hero a few more steps along his dangerous path.  Along the way, he ends up handcuffed to the lovely Madeleine Carroll, and then drags her along for the ride.  How the movie ends...well, you certainly don't expect me to tell you!<br />If you do buy \\"The 39 Steps,\\" definitely pick up the Criterion Collection version.  The extras are deluxe, and well worth the extra cost.  The Lux Radio presentation is a real gem.  One of my favorite extras on the Criterion disks.  \\"The Art of Film: Vintage Hitchcock\\" is an excellent documentary on Hitchcock's British films.  As always, the commentary is also excellent.
B000003TA4|5.0|AAARGH! I HATE these people writing all these reviews saying Nirvana sucks just because Cobain killed himself or cause he kissed Nevosolic on SNL. Who gives a crap!? Sorry to burst your bubble but you're supposed to write a review on the MUSIC! Oh well, I guess I have to do that.<br />1. Smells Like Teen Spirit: 10000/10 (I know you can't go that far). COMMENTS: No one knows what the hell he's talking about, but it's good! Propelled the teenager deordorent into stardom. Anthem for a generation.<br />2. In Bloom: 9/10 Very catchy song, gets old after a while though.<BR>3. Come As You Are: 8/10 Ohhh, the murky two-chord song. Who CARES! It still rocks.<BR>4. Breed 4/10 I hardly listen to this song<BR>5. Lithium 10/10 You think there's enough lithium in Cobain's body without writing a song about it. Whatever . . . Nevermind. <BR>6. Polly 10/10 Is he talking about raping a bird? Well it's good and has a wonderful acoustic guitar.<BR>7. Territorial Pissings 1/10 Excuse me, WHAT?<BR>8. Drain You 9/10 Very catchy. I developed a theory that he just shoots up with heroin and mumbles stuff.<BR>9. Lounge Act 15/10 Oh yeah, thats grunge. I'm filthy rich but my life sucks. Has a nice bassline. <BR>10. Stay Away 7.5/10 another good baseline. He kinda screams a lot in the last few songs.<BR>11. On A Plain 8.5/10 Whoa, it's like, Nirvana man.<BR>12. Something in the Way 15/10 I LOVE THIS SONG! Very slow very soft. I think he's talking about the Aberdeen Bridge.<br /> All in all this is the BEST rock CD. I'm not gonna call it grunge because labels bother me. Idiots calling it hip-hop. <br /> Great CD. To bad he bit the dust. I think it's cause he realized he married Courtney Love. And I'm out :)
B00008J2DQ|5.0|Hey everybody this is my first review on a CD so here it goes. This is one of the best heavy metal cds i have ever heard. The lead singer's voice is really awesome and it goes well with the music.  I encourage all of you to buy this cd if you like heavy metal. One of my favorite songs on the cd is #12. The reason i like this song is because it has a kind of tribal beat and its all calming and stuff. But thats just my opinion. So anyways, its a really good cd and you should buy it.
B00000JGHS|5.0|I love this movie... It is the best ever made and I love to watch it late at night, if you know what I mean.  Demi Moore is the best when she starts stripping, I start stripping!<br />I watch this movie every night of the week!
B000001DYD|5.0|Don't get me wrong, I loved her next three albums and anticipate her next one also, but she had something here that was just so raw, so unhinged that it almost feels like she was someone that I dated, loved and was screwed over by.  This record is beguiling, inviting you in and then ripping your head off (or \\"twisting\\" it off, as she says in the title track).  She confronts feminine iconography from the 50foot woman to Tarzan's Jane to Adam's Eve, blazing a path through a man's world.  Yuri G, for those not nerdy enough, is Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space.  I also recommend Blonde Redhead's \\"Fake Can be Just As Good\\", another blistering record from some guys who have softened up lately.
B0001L3MI0|4.0|I really enjoyed Independence Day. Will Smith was riot and Bill Pullman as the President of the USA was a kick.<br />However, having just seen Emmerich's The Day After Tomorrow, I was left wondering whether he has it in for DC, Los Angeles and NYC.  Actually, I was rather surprised at how many cheered when I watched this in the theater when the White House got it.....what were these people thinking.<br />Anyway, this movie takes you all around the world and of course a bit of luck is what causes the good guys to win.  I really got a kick out of how the Aliens on the mother ship say &quot;uh oh....&quot; when they realize their goose is cooked.<br />Interesting the graphics of the larger buildings being the target of the aliens.  Sadly the implosion of the Library Tower and the Empire State Building looked all too much like that of the WTC.<br />I can still remember the look on the man's face while looking up in disbelief as the alien ship over Manhattan begins to ignite the Empire State Building.  This as a fascinating movie and fun for the most part.  The story did drag a bit at times.  I look forward to getting the limited edition.
0062513982|5.0|In my personal opinion, I love this story because they find the way to be together and fight to accomplish their goals. Most of all, I love their determination to not give up and start a new life if Great Mother would not agree. They were afraid to chage the way of their life. Great Mother agreed to give them a second chance and they were so happy because they would be serving to God and at the same time they can be together as a couple, in this life we have to fight for our love or dreams.
B00004RFFI|5.0|This movie must have gotten Storm Chasers a real boost.  Just as more and more videos of twisters appeared on nightly TV in the 90s this movie came out.<br />One thing this movie is though it is an great introduction, in a bit of a farcical way to the science of tornados.  This season of twisters has been very devastating and with so many storm chasers today, there are even what they call 'chaser jams' as the cars load the roads.  Unlike the competition in the movie for who will get the best view, there is a courtesy.<br />However, this movie has great special effects, the cow in the air scene was somewhat comical.  Touching was the scene of the destruction of a friends house, and horrifying was the scene just prior to it of a twister hitting a drive-in theater.<br />Hunt and Paxton work together well in this movie.  The attempt to outrun the category 5 at the end was a bit unreal, yet you are on the edge of your seat as the 1/2 a mile wide funnel gets ever closer.<br />I have purchased this movie as a gift for friends and have it on my want list for the future.
0380730367|4.0|This was my first venture w/this series by the author and I might have benefitted from reading the four previous novels involving Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro as some of the interplay between them alluded to previous matters. My first Lehane experience was Mystic River which, in my opinion, is a stand alone classic. This is a different breed of cat, but an interesting one, nonetheless.<br />Kenzie has helped a young woman who claimed that a man from her gym was stalking her and that he had in fact trashed her car. This matter is easily set right by Kenzie and his side-kick and protector, Bubba Rogowski. A few months later the young lady jumps naked from the 24th story of the Custom House Tower in Boston. Kenzie feels some moral responsibility to look in to the matter as he had neglected to return a call from the woman before heading of to Bermuda with a tempoary romantic interest and when he got back he had forgotten to call.<br />His looking into the matter sets him on a chilling course of events which are better read than described here. Kenzie/Gennaro/Rodowski make a formidable and somewhat entertaining team, although some of the diologue and situations strain credulity a bit. All in all, a read that you will enjoy and be reluctant to put down until the rather twisted ending is revealed.
B00007AJIT|5.0|This movie is different from any other movie ever made.  It is a fun trip that raises many thoughtful questions.  WARNING:  DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE IF YOU SUFFER FROM PARANOID DELUSIONS OR SUBSCRIBE TO MATRIX-TYPE CONSPIRACY THEORIES.  It will send you over the edge.  The basic story is that down-on-his-luck wanna be puppeteer John Cusack reluctantly gets a day job at the gentle urging of his frumpy wife (yes they make her a frump) Cameron Diaz.  This day job changes both their lives as Cusack discovers a portal that leads to John Malkovich's head.  Nothing and no one is what they seem, and it is very hard to see who is controlling who, even at the very end.<br />I can't imagine John Malkovich's face when he was approached with this screenplay.  I can't believe anyone in his right mind wouldn't run the other way when presented with even the most basic premise for this film.  But then again, at least in the movie, Malkovich is anything but in his right mind.  Heck, for most of the film, he isn't even IN his mind.  Creepy, huh?  Creepy doesn't even begin to cover it.  But I highly recommend it.  Just be warned not to drive or operate heavy machinery after seeing it.<br />This movie is best watched late at night.  Most of the scenes are in fact shot at nighttime, adding positively to the surreal effect of the story.  Cusack, Diaz, and Malkovich turn in wonderful performances.  Catherine Keener is suitably hateable as the selfish Maxine.<br />This movie encourages you to look deep beneath the surface of a person.  It is also good for some serious out-loud laughs.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Avril has an excellent voice. You can tell from the comments made that many people have no idea what a good voice is. And I think her lyrics are completely right on for a girl her age. What kind of lyrics are people expecting? I think it's nice to see someone just acting their age and writing about what is important to them. I think she has matured from her last album and I think she's doing a great job. I really enjoy the song &quot;Nobody Home&quot;. I felt that those lyrics were painfully real.
B000068FWC|5.0|If I could give this album a &quot;10&quot;, I would! Last year's Gap ad &quot;Give A Little Bit&quot; renewed my love of this extraordinary group. Starting life as a British progressive rock band, Supertramp shifted gears and became a real pop band.  Supertramp was formed in England in 1969 by keyboardist/vocalist Roger Davies.  1974's &quot;Crime Of The Century&quot; became the band's first big smash, followed by &quot;Crisis! What Crisis?&quot; and &quot;Even In The Quietest Moments&quot;. 1979's &quot;Breakfast In America&quot; was a huge success on both sides of the Atlantic, and is considered by most people to be the band's best album.<br />Why does &quot;Breakfast In America&quot; entrance me? Is it the lyrics, the melody, the moving background, yes, but most of all the voices that rise and fill the room with joy and the resounding emphasis on the music.  &quot;Take the Long Way Home&quot; strikes a chord in my heart. I have sung the lyrics with my son while driving in the car, and it brings back the memories of our togetherness. I have told my family that at my funeral &quot;Take the Long Way Home&quot; will be one of the songs to send me on my way.<br />&quot;Lord Is It Mine&quot; has the old time feeling of longing and wanting. &quot;Gone Hollywood&quot; reveals what happens when a band makes it big, and &quot;The Logical Song&quot; tells us just that-the entire album has the feel sublime entertainment. The band has that certain &quot;joie de vie&quot; that we revere in a truly outstanding work of art.<br />My favorite band and album- you bet!  Supertramp and &quot;Breakfast In America&quot; bring it all together- the feel of the 70's. The times they are a changing, and that was the period in my life that reflects what I think life is all about. Bring It On, Supertramp! prisrob

B00000J6AG|5.0|Moby has come along way from his very first album entitled 'Moby' which was his early techno works to his most recent album 'Play'. We got a taste of what Moby can really do with ambient music, pop-techno, dance, and rock in albums such as: Everything Is Wrong, Ambient, Rare: The Collected B-Sides 1989-1993, etc... Now, Moby takes another step up and brings a lot of gospel and soul music into his keyboard and electronic music works. 'Play' gives you a wide variety of different styles of gospel and soul. The song &quot;Honey&quot; starts with a simple catchy sing-along and rhythem that builds in a nice and light techno beat. Others like &quot;Find My Baby&quot; and &quot;Why Does My Heart Feel so Bad?&quot; combine more of a soul feeling into melodic piano and light dance beats. His most successful song in the album was &quot;South Side&quot; which features Gwen Stefani (No Doubt) leading Moby in the chorus. The song also became a hit single along with it being a hit song all by itself. 'Play', towards the end of the album, steps into more slow and ambient textures in songs like &quot;Down Slow&quot;, &quot;Inside&quot;, and the poetic-like songs &quot;If Things Were Perfect&quot; (I think that's one of them that he just TALKS in) and &quot;The Sky Is Broken&quot; which is very visionary-like with its slow and soothing melodies and beginning beat throughout. The ending song &quot;My Weakness&quot; starts off with a beautiful choir background and later builds into a beautiful orchestral texture. This makes the song, with it's orchestral sound, a most remembering moment in what Moby can do...My Weakness makes for a fascinating ending for the entire CD.<br /><br /> 'Play' was his multi-platinum selling album worldwide. He later released &quot;Play: The DVD&quot; which includes numerous videos of some of the hits off of the CD. It also includes a MEGAMIX that gives you a wide variety of industrial, rave, dance, and trance mixes of songs from Play. These are both things that one should own if you are a fan of Moby.<br /><br /> That's my review, Thanks!e should own if you are a fan of Moby.       That's my review, Thanks!
B00005V9IK|4.0|Director:  Roland Emmerich<BR>Cast:  Will Smith, Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum, Mary McDonnell, Judd Hirsch, Margaret Colin, Randy Quaid, Robert Loggia, James Rebhorn, Harvey Fierstein.<BR>Running Time:  145 minutes.<BR>Rated PG-13 for some violence, a particularly scary alien scene, and brief language.<br />A quintessential example of the \\"summer blockbuster\\", \\"Independence Day\\" is a full-filled science-fiction epic with a likable cast, astonishing special effects, and a unique style of direction from Roland Emmerich.  It is a film that emphasizes the American dream, patriotism, and perhaps is a stab at communism, in which the war against the all-mighty alien terror is actually symbolizing the decades of struggle that the United States dealt with against socialist countries such as Nazi Germany and the U.S.S.R.<br />Will Smith is excellent as a rogue fighter pilot who finds himself preparing for an unusual enemy--a species of extra-terrestrials that first hovered over the planet Earth, but then struck mightily with beams of destructive fire that ripped apart all of the world's major cities.  Bill Pullman gives an adequate role as the gung ho president who must trust his heart and not let political issues determine the fate of the world as he knows it.  Jeff Goldblum play his usual scientist role, but is wittier than usual and is a grand compliment to the Fresh Prince.  The three main stars engage in an all-out battle against the aliens, eventually coming face to face with the mothership and its inhabitants.<br />\\"ID4\\" is certainly not an emotional film, but more of a visual effects spectacle that show-boats the arriving technology at the time.  Director Roland Emmerich basically states \\"screw your cool-looking dinosaurs Spielberg, check this out!\\" and lets loose with a barrage of intense explosions and catastrophe, making the first half of the film similar to that of an old 1970's national disaster flick.  The second half of \\"Independence Day\\" is truly enjoyable as the audience gets to konw the characters better and they are intertwined in a battle for mankind.  Cheesy, outlandish, and sometimes down-right stupid; however, it not taken too seroiusly, \\"ID4\\" is a rock-em, sock-em adventure that will delight the whole family.  Still probably has the coolest looking spaceship ever created on film--it is amazing!
0553296981|4.0|The Diary of a Young Girl was written by a young Jewish girl named Anne Frank. Anne wrote about her life hiding in an attic with her family for two years away from the Nazis. Anne writes about the different conflicts in her life while in hiding due to so many people living in such small quarters for two years. Anne and her family experienced many scares thinking the Nazis were coming for them. Anne Frank was an inspirational writer because she was so young to be writing about her life hiding from the Nazis, and everything she learned was from research and books she read.<br />  I don't think I could really relate to any of the characters in the story because I have never had anything that terrifying happen to me. The scariest thing that has ever happen to me was being moved from one foster home to another one after being removed from my abusive biological mother. Anne Frank reminds me a lot of myself because she had a boy that she started to like over time. Peter, the boy that she is started to like, was someone she could talk to who didn't judge her and just listened to her. I have a male friend who, over time, I have started liking. He is some one that I can talk to, and he doesn't judge me; he just listens.<br /> To be honest I didn't want to read the book about Anne Frank. The thought of reading about someone else's life was boring to me. While reading the book, I have come to realize that Anne Frank was a brave young girl to have lived the way she did. I really gained a lot learning and reading about Anne Frank. The least favorite part of the book was, after hiding for two years, the Nazis found Anne and her family and took them all away.  I wish I could change the ending but it wasn't fictional; it happened in real life.  I just wish that those horrible things didn't happen to Anne Frank and her family.<br /> I encourage people to read this inspirational book about a young Jewish girl named Anne Frank. If you don't understand how Jewish people had to spend their lives in hiding, you will get a better idea about what living in fear wondering if you are going to live to see the next day is like.ir lives in hiding, you will get a better idea about what living in fear wondering if you are going to live to see the next day is like.
B000067FP7|5.0|Director:  Joe Dante<BR>Cast:  Zach Galligan, Phoebe Cates, Hoyt Axton, Frances Lee McClain, Polly Holliday, Glynn Turman, Dick Miller, Keye Luke, Scott Brady.<BR>Running Time: 106 minutes.<BR>Rated PG for non-PG worthy-violence and some language; keep in mind that the MPAA Rating System created the PG-13 rating in 1985 largely due to this film and \\"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\\".<br />\\"Gremlins\\" gets its title from the nickname given during World-War II to mysterious malfunctions that took place on American fighter planes.  No one could explain some of the break downs, so they determined that evil little monsters created by Japan were the culprits.  The 1984 film which is directed by Joe Dante (\\"Piranha\\"), written by Chris Columbus (\\"Home Alone\\") and executively created by the one-and-only Steven Spielberg (\\"E.T.\\", \\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\\"), inducing much media acclaim and criticism alike.  It is an extremely violent film for the rating and especially dark, but overall is a touching, terrifying story that works on all levels and became one of the most popular formula-producing horror films of the entire decade.<br /> A quirky inventor (Hoyt Axton) brings home a mysterious furry creature as a Christmas present for his son (played very well by newcomer Zach Galligan), not knowing the horrors that the purchase would later produce.  The furball is named Gizmo, which looks like a cross between a Kuala bear and a Cabbage-patch kid, is not only unique in appearance-it multiplies when exposed to water, hates the sight of light, and creates horrific, flesh-eating creatures when it is given food after the clock strikes midnight.  When Galligan accidentally feeds some of his pet's furry buddies, the little creatures morph into green, scaly little monsters that proceed to wreck havoc on the city and ruin Christmas.<br />Excellent special effects, a wonderfully hilarious script-writer Columbus, an exceptional musical score from composing genius Jerry Goldsmith, and top-notch direction from the veteran Dante-making \\"Gremlins\\" a ghoulishly scary comedic romp that is like no other.  Phoebe Cates is very good as the love interest of Galligan and Dick Miller is humorous as a paranoid, cranky war veteran.  A petrifying, splendid finish.  Special Note:  The film gives some special insight to the true spirit of Christmas-SHOULD NOT be viewed by children anyways, but especially those who still believe in Jolly Old Saint Nick.
B000000HSU|4.0|Out of &quot;I Against I&quot;, &quot;Bad Brains&quot;, and &quot;Rock For Light&quot;, I would choose &quot;Rock for Light&quot;. In order to really experience the Bad Brains you need to get all three of them, but I think that &quot;Rock For Light&quot; is the best out of the three. &quot;Bad Brains&quot; is very raw and energetic. &quot;Sailin' On&quot; is one of my favorite Bad Brains songs, but only the version on &quot;Bad Brains&quot;. &quot;I Against I&quot; is slower punk, but still hardcore. You really just need to listen to it to understand. &quot;Rock For Light&quot; is the best buy between all 3, while all 3 are still worth buying. This album represents the best of a band that pretty much created hardcore punk and a positive attitude in hardcore music as well. It is also very diverse compared to others, including several reggae tracks with hardcore. &quot;Banned in D.C.&quot; is excellent on this album. &quot;Rock For Light&quot; sounds like anti-flag on crack and 100% better. &quot;How Low Can a Punk Get&quot; is energetic punk with the &quot;alright&quot;'s slipped between lines. Reggae isn't really my thing so I can't tell if the reggae songs are quality or worth listening to. But all in all I would consider this CD the best if you were looking for just one Bad Brains album. It's black jazbo's kickin ass and inspiring all hardcore punk rock from Minor Threat to Black Flag.
0792833201|3.0|Poltergeist comes from my childhood so it will always be a part of me. It was one of the first films I remember seeing and I will never forget it. To watch it now brings back memories of being a kid and for that it will always have a place in my heart.  This film was never that scary to me. For some reason I found it too silly to be scary. Poltergeist is also one of the dumbest movies to be made because there is no way a family would stay in a house AFTER chairs pile up on the table and they hear voices at night. Also who would stay in this house AFTER they got Carol Ann back? That was the straw that broke the camel's back.  When I was a child I didn't notice these things but as an adult it makes a once very interesting film seem down right pathetic. I still like this movie it just makes no sense whatsoever.
B000002KIE|5.0|Many people find the Sex Pistols to be a bunch of untalented boys trying to create a stir and get themselves noticed. This, ladies and gentlemen, is not true at all. The Pistols had a level of sophistication that is uneasily noticed but puts them above many other punk bands. Lots of people may think that groups like the Clash may be more sophisticated because of their diversity in musical influence, but the pistols still had something more. Who struck the flint that sparked the nihilism in music in years to come? I believe that the pistols beat the clash, slf, etc. to the punch. Most importantly, this album, Nevermind the Bollocks, was in ways partly responsible for killing disco. The two obvious gems \\"God Save The Queen\\" and \\"Anarchy in the U.K.\\" are put at very high esteem compared to their other songs. I think that other songs are worthy of note too. \\"EMI\\" is catchy, \\"No Feelings\\" is a funny energetic piece, \\"Pretty Vacant\\" is a Pistols' \\"Blank Generation\\", and there are many other high points to this album. High points other than #6 and #8. Nevermind The Bollocks bitcchslapped the saturday night fever freaks into line and set a nihilistic stage for future bands.
B00005B36H|5.0|With the music industry constantly putting out more and more crap everyday (nu-metal bands like taking back sunday, faith no more, good charlotte...etc come to mind) its really hard to find something original, its all the same riffs and lyrics trying to make money off MTV teenie boppers who think their life sucks. but when u hear Tool, the sanctity of music is pure again. its musical poetry, sang by the enigmatic maynard james keenan. his voice is amazing, godlike, haunting... to say the least. the other band members are extremely talented as well, perhaps most notably the drummer Danny Carey, he used to drum for nine inch nails. and Justin Chancellor's base lines are original and fit in well with the murky metal/progressive rock style. Adam Jones is a very talented guitarist, but i suppose most of the time you have to be a guitarist yourself to acually understand. Some people tend to think that on Tool CDs there are lots of &quot;filler&quot; tracks, on the contrary, people like this don't understand the band, there not there just to make money, stated by maynard during an interview (he said that he doesnt want to hear fans saying how much they love his music, he thinks it would fuel an ego and make him lazier with his music) there all artists, and these &quot;filler tracks&quot; are acually more or less artistic expression, or interludes and/or extensions to the next song. if u dont like Tool on your first listen, listen to it again, if u somehow never learn to like it, i feel sorry for you, pick it up and listen to it, then get some of their older stuff too. if you love music, chances are youll love Tool
B000005IU2|5.0|Some people may find raw power to be the stooges' best work. I find it to be pretty much a tie between Raw Power and Fun House. When I first bought Fun House I thought, \\"Oh no..I should have gotten Raw Power. This Sucks.\\" It really was an acquired taste. I had to give it a few listens before I realized that there was a lot more there. The energy and intensity in this album is amazing. From the opening scream in the incredible rocker \\"T.V. Eye\\" to the horns in the loose \\"Fun House\\" this is a good buy. (I am a heterosexual male but I must say- ) This has to be one of the sexiest album's I've ever purchased. The 36-37 minutes taken to listen to this album are minutes well spent. \\"Down On The Street\\" \\"Loose\\" and \\"T.V. Eye\\" are three songs that go incredibly well together, full of raw and unadulterated....something. Would chaos be the right word? \\"1970\\" is one of my favorite songs at this point in time. The lyrics aren't genius and are sometimes kind of confusing but the music itself is....well you really just have to hear it.
B0001NBMBC|2.0|for starters, I'm 35 years old and go back to the glory days of thrash in the 80s.  While Slipknot's first two albums were pretty decent I would not credit them with bringing back american metal because God Forbid and Chimaira were dealing out more brutal and intelligent metal then Slipknot at the same time.  My problem with Slipknot's new album is that I find it boring and, at times, down right winy.  the quieter stuff is not musically interesting to get by on its own and cory's voice sounds like a snivvling thirteen-year-old who can't get a date for the eighth grade dance.  The only part of this album that has grabbed me at all is the sweet marching band type breakdown in the middle of the second track.  I also don't care for the industrial sounds.  I don't think that Slipknot has sold out.  I do believe them when they say they are trying to grow and I respect that, but it doesn't mean that I automatically have to like the musical results of their growth process.  (...)
B0001XAOLQ|4.0|First off, this is the 6 hour version of the famous movie Das Boot. It has everything that was in the movie version along with new whole scene. The only problem is there isn't much extra features. Unlike the movie DVD version, this one doesn't have the director's audio commentary. The only extra feature it has is the behind the scene that was also included in the movie version. Of course you should own both this version and the movie version.
B00005JMEW|5.0|After six years after the boring Jackie Brown (in my opinion, sorry if you love it) Quentin Tarantino has resurrected something else. He resurrected John Travolta, now he has resurrected the 70s kung fu type of movies. <br />The action sequences in this film are really fun, but some of the sword fighting can be a bit stupid, you see arms and heads chopped off and showers of blood fires out from them. The sword battles are enjoyable to watch though. <br />I think this has quite a good cast, we have Quentin's favourite leading ladie Uma Thurman. We have Lucy Lui, who is an interesting character, and the film tells you about her childhood history. Sonny Chiba, Quentin's favourite martial artist has a short appearence, and we hear the voice of David Carradine, who plays Bill. <br />The film acts the same as &quot;Pulp fiction&quot; a bit, when it gets to a new bit it tells you the chapter on the screen, there is tons of fun dialogue, a lot in chinese too. Quentin also tries to make this film look like the 70s, he uses the classic music and films the scenes like them. He puts some scenes in b&amp;w aswell. He uses a lot of interesting characters like The bride, Bill, woman with eye-patch, and the Texas sheriff, who was quite cool. This one isn't as violent as everyone says it is, it's gory, but not violent, and it comes to a brilliant climax that all of you should have seen on a trailer or something. Be warned: If you don't like annimation scenes, you might wanna watch out, there is a scene whioch tells you about the history of Lucy Lui's character, and it's an annimation sequence. Quentin has made a brillaint comeback after the failure of Jackie Brown.
B000002J29|3.0|I'm a hardcore Genesis fan and it pained me to rate this only 3 stars. But after hearing &quot;Genesis Live&quot; and &quot;Three Sides Live&quot; I felt compelled to.<br />That's not to say this isn't good. It's very enjoyable. But it doesn't last or grow on a person. Without Gabriel, some of the old charm is gone and the band is much more professional, and therefore the renderings of Trick of the Tail-album songs are a bit sterile at times. Collins is a fine vocalist, and sounds a lot like Gabriel at times, yet I doubt he put the heart and costumes Gabriel did into &quot;Supper's Ready,&quot; always a very personal song for the latter singer.<br />The drum duet on side 4 and the &quot;Carpet Crawlers&quot; are the major highlights here. A good version of &quot;Cinema Show&quot; and competent version of &quot;Firth of Fifth&quot; are here, though synthesizers replacing Steve's guitar take away from the emotion. Finally, the closing section of the &quot;Musical Box&quot; is just stupid and &quot;I Know What I Like&quot; is nowhere near as quirky as Gabriel's but still fun because of the jam at the end.<br />Bottom line: Completists should own this, hardcore fans like me should too, but casual or middle fans could probably skip it without much worry. The studio versions of these particular songs are much better.
B000089CJI|3.0|I've heard that Death Cab's music captures the moment when you walk into a room at sixteen and find your girlfriend making out with the prom king.  If that is so, then The Postal Service captures the moment when you get over your girlfriend and fall in love with the girl (or boy) that works at the bookstore with the glasses and the knee socks.  They sound like The Pet Shop Boys, albeit atmosphericlly stripped and less serious.  The Postal Service's extremely catchy beats and layered melodies make this album a real gem.  If you like bands like The Pet Shop Boys, Air, Stereolab, or even Spiritualized, you will like this.
B000002J1M|4.0|Try as I may, I can't stay interested in Supper's Ready long enough. It's great, but condensed to 15 minutes it could have been a lot stronger.<br />That aside, the rest of this is just excellent. Almost unrecognizable from the same 3/5 of a band that brought you &quot;Invisible Touch,&quot; this goes everywhere and has a damn good time doing so. I particularly like &quot;Get 'em Out by Friday&quot; and &quot;Horizons,&quot; a beautiful short guitar piece from the bespectacled, shy Hackett. &quot;Can-Utility&quot; has an awesome guitar/keyboard interplay in the second half and sweeps you up in the drama, while the opening &quot;Watcher&quot; is a bit overrated, I think, although the spooky Mellotron opening is captivating (and better done on Genesis Live).
0385336810|4.0|If you are a fan of Sophie Kinsella then you will most definitely find her newest novel absolutely delicious.  Who doesn't have a secret?  I found myself completely absorbed in the mindlessness of the story but hey, that's what leisurly reading is about.  No one said this was going to be a classic.  If you are looking for light, easy read then don't pass this one up!
B000002J2B|4.0|Genesis has a bizarre tradition of putting all their good songs on side 1 of an album and only having one great track on side 2. It's true for Nursery Cryme, Foxtrot (heh), Selling England, Trick of the Tail, Duke, Genesis, Invisible Touch, and this baby. Only Abacab, Trespass, the live albums and The Lamb are exempt from this rule.<br />Anyway, that said, this album is great on the first side, opening with two complex prog songs. Sadly, the bass section of the recordings seem to be missing - the only time you can really here it in the first song is underneath the &quot;Hey you've got to go&quot; part, where Rutherford inserts a really cool ascending bass line.<br />&quot;Your Own Special Way&quot; is a good song, as is &quot;Blood on the Rooftops,&quot; but the rest is just kind of twee. &quot;Mouse's Night&quot; goes nowhere and the instrumental is decent, followed by the overrated &quot;Afterglow,&quot; which needs to be heard following something and not on its own, hence the name. <br />Bottom line: It's good for the first three songs and for &quot;Blood&quot; but nothing else to write home about. After this, sensing his input was not needed as evidence by lack of guitar on this album, Hackett left for obscurer pastures and the trio took the spotlight.
B000003S0K|5.0|Recorded in just 12 days after being squeezed out of Roxy Music, Eno's &quot;Here Come The Warm Jets&quot; (think Golden Showers) showcases all those eclectic interests that were just never going to fit with the languid, jaded oevre Bryan Ferry had his eyes on.  Awesome &quot;Frippertronics&quot; guitar, lyrics that showed clever could be funny and an instinctive feel for &quot;catchy&quot; songs that leave you feeling enriched rather than cheapened, Here Comes The Warm Jets rocks hard, fast and hilarious.  From the sublime 60's sound of &quot;Cindy Tells Me&quot; to the dark mystery of &quot;Driving Me Backwards&quot;, Here Come The Warm Jets just refuses to date, pall, or wear out its welcome.  Subsequent releases by Eno have been uniformly impressive but never again would he quite capture the magic of that first assault on popular culture.
B000002J1S|4.0|Well where does one begin? Yes, it's good. Yes, the lyrics are hopeless. But the music, ah, stunning on Album 1 and pretty good on album 2. It's too bad this one doesn't get any recognition except among prog fans because it is surely the highest point any rock band has ever reached. This is what embodies prog as we know it today...and yet, it is still accessible, thanks to a stellar lineup of consummate musicians. I guess I usually skip the second disc but it's worth owning for every song on the first one, a feat most bands can't equal today on ONE disc.
B00008A7QK|5.0|Time has been kind to Marc Bolan.  No rocket scientist, Marc always just assumed his boppy elfin schtick set to the simplest of boogie beats would be accepted by one and all as the works of a genius.  Initially adored mainly by 12 year old girls in England, his music has grown in stature over the years as tastes changed leaving him high and dry as the sole purveyer of a perculiar (in all senses of the word) style of rock that has over time proved remarkably difficult to reproduce.  Electric Warrior is to Bolan what Ziggy Stardust was to Bowie (his friend at the time).  Electric Warrior cuts loose from Bolans previous hippie ramblings, best realised on \\"Beard of Stars\\", and powered by superb production, and the judicious use of real musicians, the album boogies its three chord wonders into an entirely new domain that retains its unique charms to this day.  Not deep, not complex, not even all that sensible, Electric Warrior nevertheless works and provides a telling reminder that 'pop' music is a rush that dosn't have to make sense it just has to make you feel good. Very good.
B0000C9V3T|5.0|Now, I'm not a music fan, but this sound track is AWESOME! Just like the movie. Every song on it just rules. he only song I could do without is &quot;That Certain Female&quot; since it doesn't have the Kill Bill feel, but it's still good. Also, I'm no rap fan, and I thought &quot;Ode To O-Ren Ishii&quot; would be horrible, but the song that it's rapped to (In the movie, the song that plays when it's in slow-mo right before she &quot;takes care&quot; of Buck) gives me goosebumps. It's awesome. But it! NOW!
B0000256KE|5.0|Others have noted that although this album is close to 30 years old it still sounds like the future - and they're right. If your experience of Bryan Ferry is the clean sheen of albums like Avalon, then &quot;For Your Pleasure&quot; may not be where you want to go.  Although lightened with some genuinely great pop songs, the overall feel of the album is defined by the brooding grind of deliciously chilling songs such as &quot;The Bogus Man&quot; that tap a futuristic goth vein that Roxy Music never really went close to again.  Some make much of this being the last dance of Eno and Bryan working together but the truth is Eno never went here again either.  For Your Pleasure is a one-off that is so far beyond the sum of its parts that it probably mystifies those who made as much as those who continue to be entranced by its dark but oh so alien caress.
B00008EY65|4.0|I'm not a comic book fan, however; I have to admit I enjoyed this movie immensely and was pleasantly surprised. Ron Perlman in my humble opinion made the movie. I loved his character and the part he played. I'm disappointed in the negative feedback and was hoping for a little more positive remarks. I didn't find this movie or the acting chessy at all. I can't wait for the DVD to come available and I'm pleased by the hope of Hellboy2.
0061015725|5.0|This writer continually amazes me. I have virtually every one of his books and have never regreted buying a single one. This one is equally fascinating, both as a dramatic tale and as hard science behind the fiction, for nano-bots are most definitely on the way and, yes, they could spell as much trouble as salvation for us humans. Read the book and you'll see. This book, like all other Crichton books, is up there with sci-fi greats like &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;, &quot;2010&quot;, &quot;Puppet Masters&quot;, as well as cyberpunks like &quot;Mona Lisa Overdrive&quot;, &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot;, &quot;Snow Crash&quot;, &quot;Cyber Hunter&quot;, and many more.

B000099T2L|5.0|&quot;Dangerously In Love&quot; is what I would have to say the best album of 2003. She really put her heart and soul into these songs. She really sang her ass off as well. But I just want to tell all of the Beyonce' haters that, whether you know it or not, you motivate her to keep doing what she's doing to prove you wrong. Beyonce' has won 5 Grammys off of this album, matching up Alicia Keys, Norah Jones, &amp; Lauryn Hill, for the most Grammys won in an single evening by a Female Artist. I give madd props to Beyonce' and hope you Keep making great music by yourself &amp; with Destiny's Child!
B00000ING2|5.0|A film by the Coen Brothers<br />\\"The Hudsucker Proxy\\" is the fantastic story of Noville Barnes (Tim Robbins).  Norville is just some poor shmoe looking for work, but he isn't qualified for anything and he has no work experience.  He takes a job as a mailroom clerk at Hudsucker Industries.  We're not sure what they do or what they make, but at a board meeting, we find out the company is posting record profits.  When a man is done with his litany of the company's successes, the chairman, Mr Hudsucker himself, stands up on the long table, starts running, and commits suicide by jumping out the window and falling to his death.<br />What to do?  The rest of the board needs to be able to purchase a controlling interest in Hudsucker stock, but the stock price is too high.  The formulate a plan to temporarily drive down the stock prices by hiring as president of the company someone so incompetent that shareholders will be so scared that stock prices will plummet.  The dimwit president: Norville Barnes.  It is Sidney Mussburger (Paul Newman) who is pulling the strings behind the scenes to make all this happen; it is his master plan that sets all this in motion.<br />Amy Archer (Jennifer Jason Leigh) is the fast talking reporter who goes undercover to investigate Norville and find out why Hudsucker would have hired him as the president.  \\"The Hudsucker Proxy\\" is funny in a smart, clever way, and is highly entertaining.  The Coen Brothers do not make ordinary or conventional movies (\\"Intolerable Cruelty\\" aside), but they definitely make some of the top movies of any given year.<br />-Joe Sherry
B00000I3JO|5.0|I love this album. It washes over you like warm breeze. But it is VERY mellow, so heed the words above. I hate to use something as cliche' as 'desert island disc', but this would be one I'd have to include. I wish that I could find anything else remotely like it. As someone else in these reviews said, Roxy Music's Avalon is in the same league. Give it a listen, you'll be glad you did.
B000003TA4|1.0|Nirvana was such a sham. I personally think that what happened on April 5th of 1994 was actually apart of Kurt's contract. Why else would have done it? He never did a thing unless Geffen gave him the go-ahead. Anyway, Kurt's kiss with Krist was not out of love, it was done out of spite. He just did it because he thought it was funny to push peoples' buttons. It's not cool to do that sort of thing when you don't mean it in a genuine way. He didn't love Krist in that kind of way, so it was like he was mocking gays. As for a review of Nevermind's music, well, it's nothing to write home about. None of the fans know what Kurt Cobain is singing about, and yet they praise his music as if it were from the mouth of god herself. Typical. All these fans like to sing along to these songs even though they \\"know not what it means\\". Kurt sang his own songs and didn't even know what they meant, so why'd he attack his fans for not knowing what \\"it\\" means? I don't know anyone out of high school that listens to Nirvana, and I think that says something; the \\"values\\" Cobain \\"taught\\" youth only apply when you live with your parents. Really, what do you REALLY have to rebel against when you have a steady job, your own apartment, and at least some kind of social life? Nirvana will always be fashionable and trendy because there will always be teens out there desperate enough to emotionally latch onto a frontman like Cobain because they'd rather have someone else run their life. They're too lazy to speak for themselves. When you let somebody else speak for you, you have no voice.
B00005QXDD|5.0|Unlike other comedy albums this album is not just jokes with music in the background. This isn't Adam Sandler or Weird Al, you can actually get into the actual music rather than the lyrics.<BR>  This CD has everything, though. Rocking music, dumb humor, and smart music. The song Rock Your Socks is truly rockin' and it is also truly true (&quot;It doesn't matter if its good it only matters if it rocks!&quot;). Dumb humor, FHG and Double Team. Which I'm glad they never made a video for Double Team because it would be too disturbing to watch (Take off your blouse, <BR>And your underpants, Then take a look, 'Cause here me and KG come naked, Out of the side-hatch). So, if you want a great CD then buy this.
0393314804|5.0|After getting used to the admittedly difficult language (it's written entirely in dialect), I was totally engaged by Welsh's story.  This book is a brutally honest look at Scottish junkie subculture and although it isn't pretty, it's one of the funniest books I've ever read.  &quot;Laugh out loud&quot; funny, like I think Brett Easton Ellis tries to be but doesn't quite get there.  At first I wanted to throw it against the wall because the language was so difficult, but once you get used to their cadence and slang you realize that the book couldn't have been written any other way.  Also, although I'm a huge Danny Boyle fan, I'd say in this case skip the movie, 'cause it doesn't even come close!  Easily one of the best books of the late twentieth century.
B00000DGUM|3.0|This CD should have included Big Guns. That is one of the best Skid Row songs ever, and this CD does not have it. Also, there are too many remixes and unreleased versions. Why can't it just stick to the only two decent albums this band ever released: Skid Row and Slave To The Grind. So therefore, this could have been a GREAT greatest hits CD, while it ends up being a mediocre one.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|What gets me is that everybody is 50/50 over this album.  There's some who like it and can appreciate the growth musically, but at the same time there's the ones who talk smack about lyrics and the overall &quot;new&quot; sound of SLIPKNOT. QUESTION: Why say so much bullsh*t about Vol 3 and finish your sentence with &quot;I'm a fan&quot;?  To have two of the hardest albums using every 4 letter word imaginable and then release this...TALENT!  To make every album a repeat of the same overall sound....KORN!  But seriously, everyone needs to just listen, not critic, but just listen to the album and then make a educated review.  So what if Corey sang w/Stone Sour, Joey drummed for the murderdolls, but that doesn't change the fact that he is one of best drummers to kick a double.  Vol 3 isn't their heaviest, but should it be?
B0001NBMBC|1.0|Wow. Why would you change your formula if the previous one was perfectly fine? I know, they're broadening their horizons, they're taking on a new tone. In short, they ssssssuuuuuucccccckkkkkkk. When I heard the opening of &quot;Circle&quot; i wanted to vomit on my own face twice. I love &quot;Pulse of the Maggots&quot; and &quot;The Blister Exists&quot; but the metal moments are few and far between. They should've gone full-tilt Metallica and just brought in the orchestra. I figure next time they want to release an album like this one, they'll come to my house and stab me over and over instead. With that being said, I'd like to state that i LOVE slipknot and no bad release is going to turn me away from that. It's just that if I see a CD with the word &quot;SLIPKNOT&quot; on it, it better be so damned heavy, I shouldn't even be able to lift it without rupturing something. Instead, buy another copy of IOWA.
B0000648WZ|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It's brainless fun and good to watch more than once while you're working and such. Funny as all hell as it's a satire of old war propaganda. The effects are top notch. Still some of the best even after I've seen the LOTR movies.
0440180295|4.0|If anyone ever set out to write a comic, anti-war, Sci-Fi modern classic I am pretty certain they would have failed miserably.  But this is what Vonnegut has done, and he has succeeded.<br />This is a short and powerful book.  Vonnegut introduces it with a chapter about how he came to write the book, and then tells us how it begins and how it ends.  In doing so he establishes an important point.  The events in the book are to be viewed from a Tralfamadorian perspective.  These aliens see all time in a single moment.  Death is immaterial to them because existence is not linear, so you always exist, even after your temporal death.<br />So the events in the novel follow no chronology.  They leap from 1960's America to the planet of Tralfamadore at any time, and back to the war in 1944, and back earlier, and forward later.  The hero of the piecel, if he can be called that, is Billy Pilgrim, an american soldier in the Second World War, an optometrist after the war who is rich because he marries the fat daughter of a wealthy Optometrist.  She marries him despite the fact that he is a psychiatric patient suffering a nervous breakdown because of the war, or because of college stress, or because his father threw him in the deep end of the pool.<br />Their son is a troublesome boy, who straightens himself out, joins the Green Berets, goes to Vietnam and contributes to the good of society by killing Vietnamese.<br />Vonnegut finds the absurd and the funny in the most mundane of normality.  And because of this he constantly surprises the reader.  The items Pilgrim finds in the coat in the war are a case in point.  A diamond (that goes into his engagement ring) and a denture, which he keeps.  One is as arbitrary as the other in value terms.  Whereas his companion is shot by firing squad for &quot;looting&quot; a teapot in Dresden.<br />This is a short and easy read, but do not be deceived.  It is a terse and concentrated work of art, that will yield returns to the careful readerlong after you put it down.
B00005JMUA|5.0|First of all, anyone who believes that Quentin Tarantino had a smash on his hands with Vol. 1, but botched it up with Vol. 2 is SORELY mistaken. Quentin filmed both Volumes 1 and 2 as ONE FILM! It was late in the post-production process that the decision was made to split the film into two seperate pieces. It's a package deal here. People need to judge this as one film. The second half, while slower paced, is a brilliant piece of work, and it truly wraps up this epic tale of revenge. The dialogue is pure Tarantino, and the showdown between Bill and The Bride is simply breathtaking. This is what great filmmaking is all about.
B00005QEO2|5.0|Young Lust: The Aerosmith Anthology is NOT another \\"Greatest Hits\\" CD.  It is exactly what it claims to be...an Anthology.  This double, 34 track CD covers Aerosmith's rarities and B-side singles along with some mainstream Aerosmith hits from the 80's up to 2001.  Overall a great collection of Aerosmith's work.  The rarities and b-side singles are surprisingly good.  My favorites are, Love Me Two Times (Doors Cover), Head First, Don't Stop and Can't Stop Messin' to name just a few.   In my mind this CD is the companion to Pandora's Box.  Between these two compilations you'd have Aerosmith's \\"musical soul\\" in your hands.  I highly recommend these two works as the mainstay of your Aerosmith collection.<br />If you are looking for an Aerosmith Greatest Hits CD covering this era get \\"O' Yeah -Ultimate Aerosmith Hits!\\" in addition to, or on it's own if you are just a casual Aerosmith fan.   If you want to explore the Aerosmith's musical depth, Young Lust is a great trip!
1402545355|5.0|I read the other reviews and for some reason people think they have to re-write the entire plot; that's not a review.  One reviewer thought the author of this book was a woman.  Hello!!!  <br />Now, I will review the book:  it was excellent...it made me smile and feel happy.  I wanted to be a better person after having read it because there are many morality messages.  The characters were so well developed, I felt I knew these people like my own family.  The author has great insight into women's psyche
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I think that, at this point, a more appropriate question would be &quot;What happened to Slipknot's FANS?&quot; Out of all the brain-dead metalheads who hated this band for no better reason than the lack of solos, there were fans who didn't expect Slipknot to be brilliant or complex. They knew, as I know, that they were not trying to reach new boundaries or show off incredible talent; they were simply expressing themselves and trying to appease an audience. I will admit that their self-titled album didn't deserve the 5 stars I gave it in an earlier review... but this album does. Slipknot has improved themselves, and they're finally experimenting with their music. If Slipknot's third album was just more of the same stuff from Iowa or S/T, I would've been happy with it but mildly dissapointed. Instead, they have become more instrumentally complex and finally have some variety. I anticipated that Slipknot's fans would appreciate this as I do. But to my horror, they bash this album for not screaming constant obscenities and repeating the same basic formula throughout every song. I suppose I gave them more credit than they deserved. Cussing is EASY! Anyone can write angst-filled lyrics jam-packed with cusswords about how life sucks and they hate everyone! Corey Taylor should be commended for trying to push himself instead of just writing more of the same, and the entire band should be commended for expanding themselves. They shouldn't be put down for trying harder! This is Slipknot's best album, no question about it, and it DOESN'T sound like Stone Sour. Why don't you so-called fans open up your eyes?
0316168815|5.0|Just one word tells it all: wow !!!. Read, reread, and keep it beside your bed.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|I thought this was an excellent movie, at least way better than what the critics said.  I would go as far to say that it is oscar-worthy, but an all-around good film.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|The &quot;Great One&quot; has done it again.
B000001EHS|4.0|If you like good eighties rock then this is the CD for you!  I got the CD after hering Def Leppard songs on the radio, so I got the CD, and was very impressed!  It has all their songs that are worth having and is a true Greatest Hits album!
068484267X|5.0|The events that occured in Frank's childhood life is just unfathomable that it makes me cry every time I read Angela's Ashes. I imagine myself living his life of immense poverty and suffering and I know I'll never be able to go through what he has gone through in his childhood life. Frank writes with such uniqueness and passion about his childhood that not one single soul who reads his memoir will be left dry-eyed. This book deserves 10 stars instead of 5!!!
0316921173|4.0|It is no secret or should be no secret that the book has no resolution. This is misleading because it certainly aims toward a conclusion, hints and foreshadows one that the author has in mind but stops short of it as though Wallace had to hurry up and publish what he'd written so far to pay the rent. The book becomes wildly addictive as the reader gets 500+ pages into it and--as the book is about addiction--that is the point (and the big joke or infinite jest) that the reader becomes addicted and then can't continue on, has to stop suddenly, should join a 12-step IJ group, presumably. As long as it is, a lot of the questions the reader has at the beginning are, in fact, answered and you do get an idea of what is on the addictive movie cartridge but it stops as it hurls toward a conclusion that could probably fill another 1000 page book. Almost every subplot is left unresolved and hanging as though the author forgot about them completely. <br />As it turns out, the comment on the hardcover flap about &quot;a breathtaking, heartbraking, unforgettable conclusion&quot; is a complete falsehood and purposely written as part of the later joke on the reader that there is no conclusion, which feels almost as clever as it is sour.
B000002GVO|3.0|Yes, Hotel California was a massive album in terms of sales, but to me it lags way behind On The Border and Desperado in terms of quality. <br />However, to give it just one star is, in my opinion, ludicrous.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|This CD is horrible. I love Slipknot and have bought all of their CD/DVDs since they've started. This CD sounds like StoneSour with SlipKnot as the band. It sucks. The only good song is &quot;Pulse of the Maggots.&quot; Wish I could return it.
B0000C8AW2|5.0|For over forty years, Dylan has blessed this planet with his music - a special gift.  It's amazing how one man can constantly reinvent himself, his music, and change so much just with his vocal inflection.  Say what you will about Bob's voice - he's the only guy I've ever heard who can reinterpret a song (his own) and change everything based on his emphasis.  Side commentary aside, this is about Street Legal - the hybrid SACD.<br />I've never listened to Street Legal in its previous incarnations - my first listen occurred with this new version.  Some people have said the sound in previous versions was muddy - not the case here.  The instrumentation makes the record a bit crowded (or you could call it a full sound) - but the CD and SACD layers both are very clear.  They sound excellent (the SACD versions of all the Dylan works sound magnificent, by the way).  Technically, a superb recording that sounds very, very good.  Great remastering job.<br />As for the record, I really wish I hadn't taken so long to get it.  It's one of the last Dylan records I've listened to (have yet to hear Knocked Out Loaded, Down in the Groove, or all of Empire Burlesque).  I could say its one of the best - but the problem is that most all of Dylan's records can be one of his best for one reason or another.  Each has a different sound and something very different to offer.<br />In 1978, Dylan was in the midst of a recording period that, I believe, is greatly underrated.  As far as I'm concerned, the period that began with Planet Waves in 1974 and ended with Infidels in 1983 contains output that is better than what he did in the 60s (Bob Dylan to Nashville Skyline - Self-Portrait and New Morning were 1970, the latter was pretty good and the former had its moments).  The 70s-early 80s period was a time of great pain and rebirth for Dylan.  Street Legal is the last of his pain records, preceding his Chrisitian Quadrology (I include Infidels in his Christian phase - and would argue that Oh Mercy and Under the Red Sky also fit in - those are several other reviews).  <br />There are a lot of great tracks here featuring the fullest sound Dylan has ever recorded (Though Oh Mercy, Time Out of Mind, and Love and Theft are close for fullness).  It begins with &quot;Changing of the Guards&quot; - one of the best openers Dylan has ever recorded (and that says a lot for a man who's started albums with &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot;, &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot;, and &quot;Rainy Day Women...&quot;).  The album is engaging from the get-go and is very dense lyrically.  There's a lot to pick up here, and it will take many, many listens to put things together.<br />New Pony is a great - and nasty - blues take.  The rhyming schemes on No Time to Think are just amazing to listen to, and they keep your attention for over eight minutes.  Baby Stop Crying is tender and catchy in the chorus.  Is Your Love in Vain is a personal favorite - very sad and somewhat hopeless.  Senor (Tales of Yankee Power) is yet another Dylan masterpiece (not the only on this album - Guards, In Vain, and Where Are You Tonight? all qualify on this record).  <br />It's hard to figure out what to say for every song - but this album is very sad and depressing, yet powerful because of it.  There's not a bad track and Dylan's voice is in fine form.  His expressiveness his in full force her and all the arrangements are interesting to listen to - especially since they often try to cover up the songs a bit (and I think this was intentional, putting on a false face).<br />In short, get this record.  You won't be disappointed.  Heck, just buy all of Dylan's records.  There've been a lot of great artists in the last 50 years - but none of them can equal Dylan.  His musical, lyrical, and vocal power is amazing - Street Legal puts it all on display.
B00020HEG6|5.0|I must admit, when I first heard this soundtrack, I didn't enjoy any of it actually.  I think one of the reasons was I had just got the Van Helsing soundtrack, which had a totally different taste than this.  But I turned my attention towards this score, cause I thought, it's John Williams, I'll give him another try, cause he's just amazing.  So I started listening to it again, and I haven't stopped since.  It's much different than the previous two, with only Hedwig's Theme showing up in the beginning as usual, and once more in another track.  Everything else is new music, and John Williams is a master of making beautiful and memorable themes, and it shows in this score.  It's one of my favorites now, but everything new he comes out with is one of my favorites.  John Williams brings us another memorable score.  If you haven't bought it, buy it!
0765310015|5.0|Since the assassination of Emperor Kellanved, Empress Laseen has strengthened her rule over the expanding Malazan Empire and has plans to annex further territory though her militia.  She keeps her subjects loyal through a vast network of loyal effective Claw assassins and spies.<br />Currently, her legions take the city of Pale after a difficult siege with many of the troops dead.  However, instead of allowing the vaunted Bridgeburners of the Maliz 2nd Army time to recuperate, the Empress informs Imperial Command High Back Dujek Onearm to march to the next battle site to begin immediately the assault immediately on Darujhistan, the last of the Free Cities on the Genabackis continent.  Meanwhile the Gods decide to intercede.  As he questions whether he should blindly follow orders like a good soldier since his men need time to recover, Onearm begins to wonder if his monarch is a demagogue or just wants him destroyed since his loyalty had been to the deceased emperor.<br />This is the first of a ten book series but before readers panic or throw in the towel, each tale apparently is a stand-alone story at least this one is.  GARDENS OF THE MOON is a terrific military fantasy that hooks readers whether the plot focuses on royal court intrigue, godly interference, or magical and mundane battles.  Steven Erikson furbishes a magical tale that will have genre readers looking forward to future entries in the Malazan Empire epic.<br />Harriet Klausner
B000060P79|3.0|In the 1950's Eddie Cochran sang about teenage strum and drang in \\"Summertime Blues\\".  A decade later both The Who and Blue Cheer did their own versions of the same song.  Of course, The Who had their own anthem of young protest in \\"My Generation\\".  What strikes the listener now about all these records is their sense of humor-not a little poking fun at themselves.  Fast forward to the new century and we find youth fully in thrall with the therapeutic culture of Oprah and Dr. Phil.  Our typical teenager is sad, lonely and depressed with crippling issues involving his/her parents.  Our hapless teen cannot discuss his sorrows very long without dripping in tears and bitterness.  It ain't funny.<br />Unfortunately, there are two delusions attendant in all this outpouring of the youthful heart.  The first is that there is no school marm to step into messy human affairs on the playground of life to set things aright.  Most teenagers take their troubles with them into adulthood where they either learn to live with them or without them-but past an undefined point, NOBODY CARES.  No one bothers to defend this state of affairs as fair or just-it just is.<br />The second illusion most of us as teenagers believe is that things will be different when we're in charge.  We protest that things are all screwed up and IT IS NOT OUR FAULT!  As bad as the world is, we are so sure that things will be better just because we'll be there.  The truth you have to come to terms with as you get older is that as bad as the earlier generations were yours is hardly any better.  As much as your generation works to set things aright, for all the good work done you and your contemporaries are setting a whole bunch of other fires to burn Rome down.<br />On the other hand, every generation has a right to make of fool of itself at the predictable appointed times.  The very fact that young folk can say such naïve things with such unselfconscious seriousness is all-apart of youthful protest's endearing charm.  There is a long stretch (at least it seemed too long at the time) in all our lives when our very existence hinges on the fickleness of the opposite sex (\\"When I'm With You\\"), when parental demands sound like appeals to inhuman levels to excellence (\\"Perfect\\"), and when the whole cosmos seems to conspire against you (\\"God Must Hate Me\\").  That none of this is actually true is beside the point.<br />That is what we feel and we're going to say it-damn it!!!  As long it is sung to a rockin' tune and it looks like we're having a good time, what more can you ask?harm.

B00004YYDI|5.0|This film is one of my absolute favorites. I've never once watched it without being engrossed (and without crying, at least once). The international cut is far better, I think, than the one released here in the States. There are scenes that deepen the relationship between the two main characters and make you mourn the death of Jean Reno's character even more. Buy this film, this version. You won't be disappointed.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|One of Hollywood's greatest achievments is given the &quot;red carpet&quot; treatment here. The &quot;no expense spared&quot; restoration of this screen classic is a marvel to see and to hear. And the extras on these two jam-packed DVDs truly take advantage of the possibilities of this medium. Shorts, a running commentary, galleries, a classic Looney Tunes cartoon, even a &quot;blooper&quot; reel. Those old time stars certainly had foul mouths when they &quot;dried up&quot;! <br />The real treasures for me are the two Korngold extras. First, the complete &quot;premiere&quot; live coast to coast radio broadcast concert of highlights from Korngold's masterful score, played by the Warners orchestra under the composer's direction. The performance is narrated in grand style by Basil Rathbone, in the rousing, theatrical manner of the day. Imagine this happening today with a &quot;classical&quot; film score! <br />The other most enjoyable highlight for me are twelve scenes from Korngold's greatest film scores, played at the piano (and sung!) flamboyantly by the composer, to an enthusiastic audience. It sounds like a private party, and we have a front-row seat.
B0001XWV0S|5.0|I just bought this movie on it's release date.  I already owned Road Trip and Old School and I loved those movies, this one didn't disapoint. After seeing the movie I wanted to go to Europe.
B000002UZ1|5.0|For these years, a better compilation cannot be found. Although 'Old Brown Shoe' wasn't the best choice and 'For You Blue' or 'I Me Mine' would have been better, the album still shines. This set outstrips the red album a lot. The music and lyricism is great from Lennon's gritty, acidic work to McCartney's softer, melodic touches, to Harrison's mixture of both, to Ringo's humorous 'Octopus's Garden'.<br />This is a must for a starting Beatles fan (buying the original albums is better)
B00003CXIY|5.0|This movie is hilarious from start to finish. A MUST-BUY!!!
B0001XWV0S|4.0|This movie is just like alot of other movies that have came out in the past few years. If you do not own Road Trip or Old School, I recommend picking up those first. I am only 13 but i know my movies. Porky's, Old School, and Road Trip all beat this movie at comedy. Tihs is just my stupid opinion, but trust me they are. The only thing this movie has more of is German Penises, lol.
B00004TH6O|3.0|I'll make this quick and to the pointless. It is a good album if you like queens of the stone age. It is not their best album- Songs for the Deaf. It has enough to songs on it to buy but in my opinion contains fillers.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is one of the best TV shows I've ever seen.  It's a Western that takes place in space.  It stars a band of misfits (characters who transcend their stereotypes) who are aware of their insignificance and whose goals, while as varied as their backgrounds, all tend to boil down to simply pursuing their lives.  In other words, they're people.  They have strengths, weaknesses, histories and futures--like people.  The consistently pitch-perfect blend of humor and gravity invites us to become absorbed in the world of the show.  As should be obvious, I became absorbed.  I was moved, delighted, amused and touched by this show, but most of all I was deeply saddened to find out what I had been missing and to think that the show was dead.  Now, however, with a movie in production, there is hope...<P>I have yet to show this series to a single person who did not become a fan, and I only hope word of mouth will succeed in giving this beautiful show the afterlife it deserves.
0140177396|4.0|My name is Priscilla Limon and i was assigned to read John Steinbecks novel OF MICE AND MEN. I really enjoyed reading the book. I think this book is about friendship like for example when George and Lennie were running away from the town Weed. Curleys wife goes into the barn with Lennie, and then he starts to feel Curleys hair, she starts to scream and then he breaks her neck. George finds out that he did it and tells him to run away. Then George kills Lennie and then himself. Because he didnt want curley to do it. This is a great book because it shows the meaning of friendship.
630420065X|4.0|Brian De Palma's (Carrie; Scarface; The Untouchables) 1996 action film starring Tom Cruise and Jon Voight is a pretty good action film. Well, once you suspend all belief. But that is what this movie is about. Putting real life on hold and believing in the impossible, the fantastic. Cruise, an excellent dramatic actor, does a great job crossing over into an action star--even with the bad haircut. Lots of cool gadgets and interesting scenarios and that great Mission: Impossible theme. And it is great to see the intimidating Ving Rhames casted as a computer genius/geek. Inspired casting.
B000001G5A|5.0|What is so individual about K. Bohm's approach is the way he allows the music to unfold naturally...and that is is the magic. The Vienna Philharmonic introduces so wonderfully right down to the basset clarinets...all of this is so spine tingling as to defy description.<br />You really got to give his Beethoven a try...again it is so relaxed and full of beauty...he was a great artist and the only conductor the Vienna Phil named Conductor Laureate!!!
630026999X|3.0|What can you say about this movie? It isn't the best movie King has written, not by far. Romero has given us better films--Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead. It has bad animation. Bad effects (even though I am a Savini fan). Bad acting, though we get a young Ed Harris and Leslie Nielsen does put in a surprisingly good performance. And it has those annoying comic book frames within frames. There is a lot to hate about this film. But it does have a certain charm to it. Ted Danson helpless and not so suave or in control. A gruesomeness to it. King plays the hokey hick very well. You can't help but to like this movie, bad as it is.
B000001GQB|5.0|The intensity of Bohm's ideas about Mozart truly shine through...he is clearly the best in the Symphonies as an interpreter...Szell is so willful and contrived in comparison(sound on Szell is poor as well)....<br />this is one of the finest Jupiter's ever as Well!!
0060523794|4.0|The first part of the book is full of satire and is amusing. The rest four parts lack this satire and are a little bit boring. However, I've found some noteworty quotation for my thesis \\"Image of a Manager\\" when I was working on in in the university. Also, the author writes how he dealt with journalists, and I've found it interesting.    The book not presents a case study of a company innovation but describes the history of IBM in nineties. For example, the author explains in detail why OS/2 was cancelled and why did they buy Lotus and didn't buy other companies.    It's very exciting to read how the CEO has diagnosed the problems of the company and which solutions did he find.    I would also recommend \\"Leading the Revolution\\" by Gary Hamel. It is a very serious examination on how companies innovate and why should they do it, with lots of remarkable examples. Gary Hamel uses plain friendly language.    The books of Chris Argyris about organizational learning are also about innovation. Although the language style is \\"academic\\", the books are interesting and somewhat unique.

B000001ES9|4.0|Rush(1974). Rush's debut studio album.<br />Normally, when you mention the band Rush to any casual fan, they might point out some of their bigger radio hits such as 'Tom Sawyer' 'The Spirit Of Radio', and 'Closer To The Heart. Huge fans will point you in the direction of their most famous albums like 'Moving Pictures'(1981) and the cult classic '2112'(1976). Most every album Rush has ever made has defined them clearly as a progressive rock band, and by listening to them, it's easy to see what makes this band interesting to hear. However, only the debut album lacked the inventive songwriting talents of drummer Neil Peart, and as a result, most fans will disregard the debut upon the mere mention of it. Even being a huge Rush fan, I waited a long time before listening to the debut, fearing that it would never live up to the other albums. So I finally decide to give it a chance. Does it hold up well to the rest of the Rush albums?<br />Well, yes and no.<br />Surely it does lack much of the appeal of later Rush, but I find that there is still a lot to like from the debut. The original lineup is comprised of vocalist/bassist/songwriter Geddy Lee, guitarist Alex Lifeson, and drummer John Rutsey, and judging by the photos, they were all just kids wanting to rock it out. The band had nothing to live up to yet and didn't have a real fanbase, so they just concentrated on making good hardrock music. True, many comparisons can be made to Led Zepplin here, but they are by no means just clones of that band. The production is typical of most early 70s classic rock bands, and the guitar tone is generally heavy for the time, complete with lots of 70s psychadelia. Instrumentally, it's a very good album. Geddy's voice is at its highest here, which is either a good thing or a bad thing, depending on your taste. Rutsey is decent on the drums, though certainly no Neil Peart. Alex definitely steals the show on this album, with some excellent riffs and solos throughout. At this point, Alex's playing is probably the only foretelling of the future Rush. While the debut is instrumentally outstanding, it's the lyrics that really suffer here. I won't lie, this is lyrically the worst Rush album, and Geddy writes them all in typical AOR fashion. Neil Peart thankfully took over in the lyrical department from then on, although Geddy did write some excellent hardrock songs on the debut. Perhaps the cliched lyrics do have some charm, as they do fit in with the classic hardrock songwriting style of the songs. So as long as Rush fans can remember that these songs are meant to be fun rockers as opposed to heady rockers, then they can enjoy the album for what it is.<br />It starts out with Alex's awesome classic rock riff in 'Finding My Way', followed by the brief fast rocker 'Need Some Love'. 'Take A Friend' features some excellent guitar work and a catchy chorus. 'Here Again' is the album's long ballad. Not a wimpy ballad by any means, but more along the lines of a blues based ballad. The pace picks right back up with 'What You're Doing' and the infectious 'In The Mood'. 'Before And After' starts off light but turns into another good rocker. The one track that sticks out in my mind the most is of course 'Working Man'. The other rockers on the album are just as good, but 'Working Man' is extremely memorable, fortelling Rush's later songwriting style greatly, and featuring a lot of excellent axework by Alex. To date, this song and also 'In The Mood' are the only songs played off the album, and they both stand the test of time very well.<br />How does the debut album fare in the context of Rush's other albums? Well, it has great songs, but I'd be lying if I said that this was one of the band's best albums. Still, any real fan of Rush should NOT pass this one up. It gives you the insight on what started Rush in the beginning. So how does one rate this album? I give it 4 stars in comparison to other Rush albums, but as just a hardrock disc it deserves 4.5 stars. I actually really like this album and I'm glad I didn't skip it. Any enthusiast of hardrock music will find the debut a worthwhile investment. Fans of Led Zepplin, Eric Clapton, and Cream may find themselves in familiar territory here. It's probably not the best place for new fans to start, as it may confuse people on what Rush is really all about, but it's a great purchase after you've explored the band's other 70s albums. DEFINITELY WORTH A LISTEN.
0375751513|4.0|The Picture Of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde is set in London, England. This story is about a young man who grows to be a sinful and terribly vain man driven by love, beauty and art.<br /> The Main character, Dorian Gray, at the beginning of the book is a beautiful and youthful man. Dorian was a man everyone wanted to be around just because he had innocence and he was different. \\"He has a simple and beautiful nature.\\" Says Basil Hallward. This innocence and beauty changes as he becomes friends with Lord Henry and his values of life change him. Because Dorian was so naïve, Lord Henry lured Dorian into a whole new life and new philosophies about love, beauty and selfishness.  This is not the only deep friendship that is developed in this book. Dorian also becomes friends with Basil Hallward and Basil paints a portrait of Dorian and Basil puts his whole heart into this painting for it to ultimately destroy himself and Dorian. Anyway, Dorian wishes that he could stay young all his life and always be beautiful. As he grows older Dorian does many terrible and shocking things but he still remains beautiful and untouched while his painting of himself shows the real nasty, terrible, and corrupted Dorian.<br /> One part of the book that really captivated me is when Dorian murder's one of his good friends. I think this is one of the turning points in the book because I believe Dorian realizes that life shouldn't be based on the appearance of things but more about quality and spirit. Dorian understands that his lifestyle of upscale parties with London's elite, and his friendship with Lord Henry is not all that it seems to be. You can see that after Dorian murders someone he questions himself and the painting because he realizes what the painting has done to him. During the last pages of the book we can see how Dorian self-destructs and finds away to restore the painting of exquisite and youth.<br /> This book was very different from anything I read and I loved it. I like how Oscar Wilde wrapped me into this book with many compelling and interesting thoughts.  The main lessons I learned from this book is question your role models and to value your life. Another lesson I learned is to not worry about beauty because if we only pick things that are beautiful we miss the wonderful and mysterious things that don't look pretty but deep inside they are.ilde wrapped me into this book with many compelling and interesting thoughts.

B0000C0FJB|5.0|Rush In Rio(2003). Rush's fourth live recording.<br />Throughout Rush's career, there have previously been four live recordings, capturing the magic of the mighty rock trio in different time periods. First there was All The World's A Stage(1976), then Exit...Stage Left(1981), followed by A Show Of Hands(1988), and finally Different Stages(1998). The one thing all these mentioned live albums have in common is that they were all released at the end of the band's different phases, taking place roughly 4 albums apart each. Now, already only one studio album after Different Stages is another 3 disc live set taken from the last show of the Vapor Trails tour, known as Rush In Rio. At first I was a bit worried that another live album would sound forced and stagnant, especially right after Different Stages was released. Plus, the band is nearly 30 years old with Geddy, Alex, and Neil all in their 50s, so I was afraid that the band might not sound as good as they used to be. <br />Thankfully, my worries were all put to rest, and honestly Rush In Rio actually sounds pretty good! Age hasn't slowed these guys down one bit, and thanks to their largest audience, the band plays with more passion and energy than they have in years, and as a result the performance is greatly inspired. Geddy can still rip on the bass and hit most of the high notes. Alex still impresses in his ability to shred on the guitar. And Neil hasn't lost any of his drumming abilities! One listen to the drum solo 'O Baterista' is enough to convince you that he is indeed one of the greatest drummers in existence.<br />Two major complaints I always hear by people is that the production is too muddy and that the crowd overpowers the music. First of all, the band specifically stated in the booklet that Rush In Rio was an &quot;official bootleg concert&quot;. To anyone who knows anything at all about bootlegs, it means that the sound isn't clear and polished, so the live recording will seem more like a real live performance. This applies to the complaint on the crowd as well. Yes, the crowd can be heard very clearly, but at the same time the performance thrives on the crowd, and as a result, this sounds like a true live show. The band still tweaked the sound just enough so that you can hear the recording well, and considering this is supposed to be a bootleg concert, Rush In Rio is the BEST bootleg I've ever heard. If you still hate the raw sound quality, keep in mind that Rio is their greatest audience in their entire career. Imagine that you're in a rock band who has already passed your prime and would seemingly never achieve fame again, only to discover that you are welcomed by hundreds of thousands of fans that you never knew existed in a region you never toured, and are regarded as big as the Beatles. Wouldn't that be absolutely amazing? Rush saw it fit to release this live performance (also available to watch on DVD) because it was one of their best shows, and I will not argue with them. If you really hate the crowd noise and sound mix, then just listen to the studio versions. The only complaint I had with the sound was that there were a few times where Geddy's voice got lost in the mix, but other than that I have no qualms with the sound.<br />All the sound quality issues aside, Rio easily has the best song setlist of all the live albums, bar none. Though Different Stages was good, I thought that the tracklist was lacking because it mostly focused on their 90s and 70s material, but left out anything from the 80s. Likewise, A Show Of Hands only featured the 80s albums and disregarded anything else. Rio's setlist gets rid of these flaws and covers EVERY phase of the band. With the exception of Caress Of Steel(1975) and Hold Your Fire(1987), every album shows for at least one song somewhere in the performance. The songs were well picked too. Of course you've got the band's big hits like 'Tom Sawyer', 'The Spirit Of Radio', 'Closer To The Heart', and others, but I'm glad tosee other songs too like 'New World Man', 'The Pass', 'Big Money', 'Dreamline', and especially the FULL VERSION of 'Natural Science'. Then there's also plenty of songs from Vapor Trails(2002), many of which have added guitar solos and sound MUCH better live. The aformentioned 'O Baterista' is a real treat on the ears, comprising of parts of 'The Rhythm Method', and the drumming parts of 'Driven' and 'Scars'. '2112' isn't the full version like on Different Stages, but it has enough of the song, so I'm not complaining. I love the 'By Tor/Cygnus/Working Man' medley, as it ends the concert on a great note. <br />So is Rush In Rio worth investing your time? You bet it is! It's by no means a mandatory release, considering that there are already so many live albums, but if you don't have any of them, then Rio is a good &quot;best of&quot; overview of the band's history. 5 Stars. The sound may not be perfect, but if you can get past it, then you'll enjoy one of Rush's greatest live performances in their entire career. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
078401213X|1.0|I watched the movie after several people urged me to watch it. They must have thought that since I am into Math and even number theory myself I would enjoy it. The opposite is true. The bombardment of pseudo-mathematical lingo and random High-School-level math tidbits is agonizing if you have any knowledge of higher Mathematics. Paul Erdos (one of the greatest number theorists ever) is turning in his grave after this movie. So, if some people with negative reviews state that you shouldn't watch it unless you are a Math geek they are wrong. Don't watch it if you *do* like Math.<br />In addition, the movie feels agonizingly long, though it's just over 80 minutes long. The reason is that over long periods the movie is incredibly slow, interrupted by regular acute pain attacks of the main character Max. I was so bored, I was thinking to myself \\"Must be time for the next migraine attack.\\"<br />I actually hope that the true interpretation of the movie is that everything was just pure imagination, a hallucination created by a tumor in Max' brain. A little bit like John Nash's futile search for patterns in chaotic systems in the movie \\"A beautiful mind\\" that was made a couple of years later. The parallels between the two movies are plentiful: John Nash and Max Cohen are both mathematicians and think they are being chased by powerful enemies (secret service vs. powerful Wall Street firm). When Max marks numbers with a pencil and connects the marks to find geometric patterns it looks exactly like John Nash trying to find patterns in newspaper articles.<br />Admittedly, this is contrary to the interpretation of a lot of other people who want to see a deeper meaning in this movie, but unfortunately it is the only way to reconcile this pseudo-scientific babble.
6305511055|3.0|Released the year after Watergate, this was among the first of the &quot;paranoid thriller&quot; films involving conspiracies, rogue CIA agents, and whatnot. While it probably seemed groundbreaking and fresh in 1975, three decades of similarly plotted movies have dulled Condor's edge.<br />Robert Redford plays an agent, code name &quot;Condor,&quot; who works in a scholarly-appearing CIA front organization in New York that analyzes world literature for significant patterns (whose significance to the spook agency isn't spelled out very convincingly). While he goes to the deli to pick up lunch for his crew, a team of assassins gains entry to the office and wipes out all of his colleagues there, as well as another who is at home. Redford, realizing he was supposed to be among the victims, goes on the run and plays cat-and-mouse with various CIA officers, any of whom could be behind the killings.<br />He chooses at random a woman photographer (Faye Dunaway) as his unwilling accomplice while hiding and trying to penetrate the evil cabal within the &quot;Company.&quot; In one of the screen's unlikeliest romances, Dunaway finds her fear and distrust of Redford's character yielding to belief in his story and then a dangerous liaison with him.<br />The director, Sydney Pollack, has often blended the elements of commercial cinema with intelligence and taste (e.g., Out of Africa).  This is another such attempt, but not one of his better efforts. The genre has worn thin, as noted earlier, and the script staggers from cliche to cliche. I won't be giving away anything important if I tell you that the denouement is, yes, &quot;It's all about ... oil!&quot;<br />I am usually unable to warm to Redford, and this was no exception. There is no &quot;there&quot; there, as Gertrude Stein said about Oakland. He strikes poses and lets his golden hair do his acting for him. There is also a featured (but minor) role for John Houseman as a sour, cold-eyed case officer. He lays it on thick.<br/>Still, several of the performances give Condor what distinction it has. Dunaway is better than I would have expected, quite credible and sometimes touching as a lonely introvert. Cliff Robertson, one of the underestimated actors of the '60s and early '70s (what ever happened to him?), is strong as the CIA officer assigned to &quot;bring in&quot; Condor. Best of all is the great Max von Sydow, who starred in many of Ingmar Bergman's films, playing a freelance assassin. Watch how a master actor makes a meal out of a feebly written part.<br />Several scenes were shot outside and inside the World Trade Center, which was then brand new. They are chilling in a way the filmmakers could not have conceived.
B00004STPT|5.0|I think that this is one of only a handful of soundtracks that should appeal to just about everybody whether or not they liked the movie.  I didn't particularly care for the film myself, but I love the soundtrack.  This score is reminiscent of other Zimmer works like the Rock and Crimson Tide in parts, but possesses a powerful emotional underpinning.  I would recommend this soundtrack highly, along with Badelt's Pirates of the Caribbean which is also excellent although perhaps less reflective and more action oriented.
6305451591|1.0|Yes, I know I am in the minority here, but I absolutely loathed this movie. For benefit of the doubt reasons, I did watch it twice, just to ensure my reaction was intellectual as well as emotional (even worse the second time). I still remember Steven Spielberg's face at the Academy Awards -- he hated this film, and I understand why.<br /><br />Nothing in this movie rang true, nothing; false from beginning to end: even the sets reminded me of Disney, a movie stage. No camp ever resembled anything in this film. Roberto Benigni is little more than a clown without the soft, sad core, and had no business manipulating a subject as horrific as 'Shoah' to suite his broad, comedic purposes. Nowhere do we see the true nature of anti-Semitism, or Nazi viciousness; it is all soft focus, blunted and romantic. Curiously sterile. As a result, I felt nothing, no sympathy, only anger. So contaminated I needed a shower.<br /><br />My mother, a survivor of the war, whom I asked to watch the movie, could not stomach it. She said it was \\"repulsive\\" and \\"disgusting\\", an unrealistic fantasy that made light of a collective experience. She was in her early twenties then and clearly remembers the war. I have also spoken with other survivors, Jewish and Gentile (including Italian) over who have seen 'Life is Beautiful' (granted, a small number -- fifteen or sixteen): I dare not print the invectives. One very elderly gentleman I spoke with a few years ago shook his head, spat, and wept -- \\"this funny man should rot. He does not understand.\\" This gentleman has since passed on.<br /><br />It seems Europeans who lived through the war as victims of Axis torture have a different perspective from most of these reviewers. The scars are still too deep and hard for many to stomach this travesty. No one can tell these people to \\"get over it, it's just a movie\\", a phrase I have actually heard.<br /><br />Want to find out what really happened? Invest eight hours in watching 'Shoah', a devastating, haunting, experience, and one true to history.history.
B000002UTY|5.0|This is an excellent live album.  It is about 50 minutes long.       The translation from LP to CD is nearly perfect.  Almost too perfect.  There are some audio defects in the recording, such as a high pitched whine during the bass solo on Who Do You Love.  They weren't that noticible on the LP, being hidden under the other defects you get with vinyl.  Now, with the crystal clear sound of a CD, these audio defects are more pronounced and stand out more.    It starts out with a 25 minute, high energy version of Who Do You Love.  There are numerous innovative guitar and bass guitar solos throughout.  It also contains rare tongue clicking and handbone solos.  If I have one complaint about the this track, it is the middle section with the drum and audience solos.  They are fun and interesting.  But, they are something that you like to listen only once in awhile.  Sometimes you just want to get down and boogie to the guitar solos.    The second half (side 2 of the LP) is a suite of 3 songs that were actually recorded in 3 different places.  They are edited together to make a seamless set.  Mona is a powerful blues number, Maiden of the Cancer Moon is a nice guitar solo and Calvary is some very spacy guitar.  It ends with a studio version of Happy Trails, written by Dale Evans, wife of Roy Rogers and used as Roy Rogers theme song.    Who Do You Love and Mona were written by Bo Diddley (Ellis McDaniels).  He was one of the pioneering blues/rock cross over artists.  There must be hundreds of versions of Who Do You Love.  Quicksilver's and the Door's are my favorites.    If you like this album, you should check out the Welsh group, Man.  They have a similar sound.  Quicksilver guitarist, John Chipollina worked with Man at one time.  When Chipollina died, Man wrote Sons of Mercury in his honor.  Deke Leonard, Man's guitartist said, why does it have it to the good ones, why couldn't have been Phil Collins instead.  Man albums to check out include Back To the Future, 1999 TourPart and Live at the Rainbow.
B00005BJ9W|5.0|I'm afraid not, people. What's more, is that the previous reviewer constantly compares the legendary Duran Duran to Roxy Music hundreds of times. Not only is the comparison inaccurate, but we're all sick and tired of hearing it. Oh, Amazon if you can hear me: please revoke the account of that silly girl Terri Reardon. And to you, the consumer, please buy this amazing masterpiece of a CD. Unlike Terri, I actually listened to it.
6303920713|5.0|While about the only inner city experience I had was working in Buffalo for a couple of months, I did enjoy this movie. If you didn't catch it in the opening, it is based on a true story, and that in and of itself is an awesome testimony of hope. I think that Louanne Johnson would ask for no sympathy being a former Marine. I remember seeing this movie the year after I graduated and enjoying the song, \\"Gangsta's Paradise\\" by rapper, Coolio. It was a major status symbol that made this movie great. That was almost 10 years ago. Today, I find myself having a major problem with that song. Listen to the lyrics closely enough, and it appears that Coolio is plain feeling sorry for himself, bathing himself in self pity. That, in my opinion, contradicts the movie by saying, \\"I am nothing more than a victim of circumstances.\\" Boo-hoo-hoo!! I don't know how many jobs I've been fired from, only to dust myself off and get another one. You are only a victim if you make yourself a victim.<br />Michelle Pfeiffer played an awesome role, the encourager. You take a close look at the role of Courtney Vance as the principal, the one who wants you to knock before entering and you can't help but ask a simple question, \\"Is he a prick, or a piller of society?\\" He almost falls into a neutral category for me because of who he is, and his definition of tough love is not something everyone agrees with. It isn't everyday I'd give a movie of this nature a 5 star, but it is an exception.

B000148KK2|1.0|Diana Krall does not have a naturally great singing voice.... but I own nearly all of Diana Kralls jazz CDs and have considered myself a fan of this bright talent for several significant reasons.<br />1. Her vocal PHRASING has been incredible.  Jazz is a difficult genre to sing because the phrasing and the emotion a singer places on certain words or phrases in a song become paramount. Sarah Vaughn, Anita O'Day, Carmen McRae, Billie Holiday and Ella Fitzgerald all had superb phrasing and expressed great emotion in their singing, and Diana became heir to this style and yet had a magical and unique phrasing all her own. It made her a bright young star in the world of jazz.<br />2. Diana has consistantly taken the high road in the QUALITY of the songs she has selected with her producers. The songs she has performed are genuinely classic, timeless and difficult to sing. Diana met the challenge and not only performed them without &quot;vocal gymnastics&quot; but respected these songs in the way Frank Sinatra did.... allowing the song to be heard as written by the composer. Lyric and melody intact, yet charming us with a style and musicianship clearly her own.<br />3. Diana's arrangements were thought out, subtile, expressive and appropriate for the song. Superb full-scale arrangements by Claus Ogerman, or simple combos with Diana's signature piano style that carressed the song melody so perfectly. <br />&quot;The Girl in the Other Room&quot; has NONE of the above. The original songs on the album are not sophisticated nor particularly interesting enough to need great emotion, and they don't get much of it here....  and the lyrics and tone of these tunes seem to be self-absorbed and, funny enough, depressing. The remainder of the songs, though better constructed, do not suit Diana's voice or style, though she has given it her best but she is on very foreign turf here. There are plenty of singers who do this very genre much more justice... Norah Jones, Mary Chapin Carpenter,Sarah Mclachlan, Tierney Sutton, Bonnie Raitt and Rickie Lee Jones to name a few.<br />For &quot;demanding&quot; jazz fans who crave those rare albums of sophistication, romance, passion and musicianship in lyric and melody that (Diana has given us in abundance in the past) will find this album a huge disappointment both musically and emotionally. Those who enjoy a simpler style of pop won't mind this album, but would be better served by those mentioned above who perform it so very well. If Diana is indeed experimenting with new styles of singing, perhaps a country, blues or hip-hop album is next? She would perform those just as well... but what for?

B0001UL7RY|4.0|Ok. To be honest I thought this CD would suck! But it kicks ass! I've been a fan on and off since Avril's debut song, Complicated...and after awhile I quit liking her cuz I thought she was a poser and immature. Well compared to her 1st album, this album is SO much better. It has good songs, great beats, and is much more mature. My favorite songs off this album are:   Nobody's Home 4/5   He Wasn't 4/5   My Happy Ending 5/5 (my fave song!)   Take Me Away is pretty good but my radio station has WAY overplayed it.
6305897786|4.0|I enjoyed the film and thought it quite credible in its portrayal of the sin of greed.  I saw Depp less as a money-crazed book merchant than a &quot;student&quot; who simply took the opportunity to have other people support his studies, involuntarily or not.  He was amoral in his pursuit of the &quot;Ninth Gate&quot; in the purest sense: He didn't do it for love of money or immortality but simply because he wanted to find out what was on the other side.<br />My mixed feelings come from not being able to recommend or purchase a work by a wanted fugitive from justice.  Polanski raped a 13-year old girl and fled to France when he was found guilty.  He remains at large only because France refuses to extradite him.  Until he returns to the US on his own or in handcuffs to face the music I won't buy his work.
B00008BXJG|5.0|Given that Bon Scott's hard-partying, sex-booze-and-brawls lifestyle tragically caught up with him some six months after Highway to Hell was released, the album-opening title track -- one of hard rock's all-time classics -- now takes on an eerie resonance. It's not just a snotty, nihilistic party anthem, but a moment of unrepentant self-recognition from a rowdy ruffian who, for better or worse, exulted in what he was. The rest of the songs on Highway to Hell don't lend themselves to any deep readings, but of course, that's not the point. Highway to Hell distilled all the virtues of AC/DC's signature minimalism -- loud, simple, pounding riffs and grooving backbeats -- into the tightest batch of songs the group had written to that point, barreling along at a take-no-prisoners rate and producing a handful of gems (\\"Girl's Got Rhythm,\\" \\"If You Want Blood (You've Got It)\\") along the way. Highway to Hell is not only a fitting epitaph for Bon Scott, it's also a classic rock & roll album.
B0000648WZ|1.0|This is easily the worst rendering of ANY well written novel to the big screen that I've ever seen. Except for the names of the characters, there was practically no resemblance to Heinlein's masterful \\"future history\\". Where is the powered armor, which is the reason for the \\"Mobile Infantry\\" name? Why do we have a silly-assed, unbelievable love story between Jonnie & his pilot childhood friend? Why do we have nude shower scenes, which seem to have no place in the storyline? Did the producer & director spend their entire budget on computer generated images, so they had none left for a decently done screenplay? The ONLY redeeming feature in this film is the CGI. It is pretty well done. But the story has been twisted from the alternative culture which Heinlein described, to some neo-Nazi regime that would not be worth saving. This is truly the worst waste of celluloid I've seen in recent years. Of course, if all you're looking for is more mindless Hollywood twaddle, CGI special effects and gratuitous nudity, you may enjoy it. But be warned, it's even further from the book than Tom Clancy's \\"The Sum of All Fears\\" was. Don't waste your money!
B00020HEL6|5.0|Kudos to everyone involved in bringing &quot;Renee Olstead&quot; to our lives. This album is ear candy of the highest order. The singing, the songs and the music are so delicious I'm surprised there's no calorie count on the label.<br />And what more can you say about Renee herself that hasn't been said already? This girl is one in a billion. What a discovery! What a joy to hear her mesmerizing voice breathe fresh life into old favorites.<br />I truly hope young people will embrace this album and appreciate how brilliantly talented one of their own can be. Renee might just be the one to set their sights higher.
B0002234LS|5.0|I am now a Johnny Depp fan.  I always thought he was pretty cool, but now I'm a huge fan.  For one thing, he's a marvalous actor.  His portrayal of the frazzled writer was simply wonderful.  I'm personally a writer myself, and I almost felt like I was watching myself, how I feel when I have writer's block, procrastination, etc. And the ending, wow.  He was amazing.   <br />The film also scared the crap out of me.  Not because monsters were jumping out every five seconds and people were getting slaughtered, but because of the eerie atmosphere, the building fear and paranoia, and that creepy guy screwing with Depp's mind.  <br />Many have also commented on how \\"predictable\\" the ending was.  Give me a break.  I thought it was a lovely twist and done so well, I wanted to applaud it.  I saw it at the theater with a friend of me and we were completely shocked and disturbed.  To those that said \\"oh gee, I knew before the movie even started how it was going to end!  It was soooo obvious!\\"  Come on.  Get over yourselves.  Yes, maybe it has been done before, but I sure as heck wasn't expecting it. <br /> Seriously, if you figured it out ahead of time, good for you, but don't say the movie was terrible for it.  I know people who \\"had figured out the twist of the \\"6th Sense\\" five minutes into the movie\\" but everyone still agrees how awesome that movie was regardless.<br />Anyway, despite not being a huge fan of movies based on Stephan King's books, I thought this movie was awesome.  Scary without being gruesome.  Just plain creepy really.  And Johnny, you rock.
B000002H4Q|1.0|this cd is horrible.  pearl jam lions is a piece of garbage and all he listens to is whiny british babys (i.e) the cure and radiohead.  i agree with pearl jam being good but bashing talented bands like creed &amp; limp bizkit is just wrong.  pearl jam lions probably likes coldplay too and every other british whiny band.  sorry pearl jam lions but we're all waiting for the cure to break up if they haven't yet.  if they did no one would notice anyway cause nobody buys their records anymore anyway.  radiohead's audience shrinks with each album and they just plain suck.  sorry pal hahaha!!!
6304366086|5.0|It has been said that this is the best racing movie ever made.  It is.<br />No movie before or since has been able to capture the feeling and essence of racing in the 60's or any other era.<br />What director Frankenheimer does in this movie is still exciting even by today's standards.<br />Even though I am a huge Steve McQueen fan, Le Mans definitely takes second place to Grand Prix.<br />I was really excited to see the movie Driven with Stallone, until I saw it.  All I kept saying to myself was &quot;This is not even close to Grand Prix&quot;.  Grand Prix has not only raised the bar, but has set it as well.<br />Do yourself a favor, don't rent, but rather buy this film and get ready for an education on how great movies were made and should be made.
0684171600|3.0|This is a beautifully written classic that can take you to a different world, or maybe two. Set in the time of pirates, this book takes you on a treasure hunt that is full of back-stabbing, loyalty, and adventure. The author keeps you compelled to read on because of his lack of detail for conflicts. You just cannot wait to turn the next page to see why this man is angry, what happened in the past, and what kind of foreshadowing you can get for the future. The only bad part about this book is the extremely confusing language. That author uses the slang and terms that of the time and setting, which is great because it's accurate, but almost annoying because it's hard to keep up with. This book also requires a little back-up knowledge of the story, because the language you read might confuse you, and cause you to not get enough information on the story at hand and characters in it. In this book my favorite character was \\"the bad man with one leg\\" (you'll find out who it is later in the book, I won't ruin it) because even though he's the evil character, he's so wonderfully generated and portrayed. His evil-ness is overtaking the man itself, and while you'd love for Hawkins(the main character) to avoid him, and stay safe, you find yourself also begging for confrontation, just to see what the \\"one legged man's\\" scheme will be. Overall, I think this is a classic for every generation. And unless you're obsessed with love stories, this book will have it all. Also, people who don't even like adventure type books will enjoy this novel too because of the sheer greatness of it all. \\"Treasure Island\\" is constructed amazingly well, with all the good cliff hangers left for you to read and figure out for yourself, and all the parts that \\"make you twitch\\" are in all the right places.
B00008US8R|1.0|Since when is &quot;Evanescence&quot; is good band? I don't think they even deserve to be called, because they pretend to be hardcore rockers, but in reality they're just whiny sissies who are no more rock than the song &quot;If you're happy and you know it&quot;. If everyone smashed c.ds like this, then it would be a perfect world. But they don't, they just keep living their stupid mockery lives, and get married and have children. And those of you who call yourselves &quot;goth&quot; and listen to Evanescence make me sick. My current and standing opinion is: There is no help for this world. I am disgusted.

B00005JMEW|1.0|JUNK THE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS IT WAS ONLY 99 MINUTES.  IT TRIES TO MAKE FUN OF 60'S AND 70'S MOVIES AND FAILS COMPLETELY.  WHAT A WASTE OF TIME.  I USELY LIKE Q.T. MOVIES.
B000059HAI|4.0|...this movie, which got awesome air scenes and very well documented background info (politic, diplomatic, and military), had been a couple of minutes longer at the end of 1st part. And showed how Roosevelt, who was informed of the results of the (fantastic) Intelligence work -they even could pin the time of the attack- decided to keep it under wraps: so that, without any prior warning, the damage would be maximum, and the shock upon American people would be such as to suppress the reluctance they still got towards entering the war. One of the best examples of &quot;The end justify the means&quot;. The Pearl Harbor story could as well have as title &quot;They were expendable&quot;.
0061020710|5.0|Fantasy has never been one of my favorite genres, but I decided to give the magical world of Discworld a try at the suggestion of several friends. I am very glad I did. This turned out to be a very different kind of fantasy, in spite of its wizards, trolls, and dragons. Discworld is a flat planet resting on the backs of four elephants riding on the back of a turtle that slowly makes its way across the universe. As strange and steeped in magic as Discworld is, it seems suspiciously like our own world. Its inhabitants have some very familiar vices and pastimes. Author Terry Pratchett is a wonderful cross between Douglas Adams, Piers Anthony, and Mark Twain, and his Discworld novels are full of great fun, inventiveness, and wicked satire.<br />&quot;The Color of Magic&quot; is the first story in the series. This paperback edition comes with an appendix that makes a handy travel guide for first-time tourists of Terry Pratchett's amazing fantasy land. It includes a brief musing on Discworld, a synopsis of the main cast of characters in the series, a nonmap (after all, how can a sense of humor be mapped?), a guide to Discworld on thirty dollars a day, and even a crossword puzzle to quiz you on what you have learned on your maiden voyage.<br />The bumbling wizard Rincewind, a wizard college dropout and the quintessential coward, is appointed as guide and protector for the four-eyed tourist Twoflower, who hails from a gold-rich city on the Counterweight Continent and who has come to the bustling metropolis of Ankh-Morpork to see the sights. As the story opens, Ankh-Morpork is in the process of burning to the ground, and Rincewind and Twoflower are fleeing to safety. Accompanied by a frightening piece of many-legged luggage, the twosome experiences one misadventure after another. They are threatened by thieves and magic spells, made pawns in a dice game of the gods, dogged by Death, chased by dragons around the upside-down mountain of Wyrmberg, and shipwrecked at the edge of Discworld. The end of the story leaves the reader hanging in midair (literally), but that's OK - because there are many more volumes that follow in this richly creative and hilarious series. These novels are like potato chips - bet you can't read just one!<br />Eileen RiebackDiscworld.

B0000004V2|3.0|&quot;I Wanna Be Adored&quot; is a perfect tune; along with songs like &quot;Satisfaction&quot; or any of a handful of Beatles songs it is etched in recording history; it has an appeal that will always endure.
B00015HVI8|4.0|Stargate SG-1, to me, wasn't exactly what I'd come to expect from my favorite show. The loss of Daniel Jackson was, of course, a large part as was the way the introduced Jonas Quinn. Throughout the season they kept telling us point blank how great he was and how he was needed. &lt;shrug&gt; That, in itself, made me dislike the character just like O'Neill did.<br />But the real disappointment for me was the dark, X-Files-like direction the show took. Gone was wonder of the 'Gate and the excitement of new worlds and cultures. It became too mottled down in Earthbound stories of corruption and conspiracies.<br />Abyss was an excellent episode for the fact that Richard Dean Anderson and Micheal Shanks share a rare chemistry. It's apparent they enjoy playing off one another. That's SG-1 at its best. The byplay between the characters, with cool special effects thrown in!<br />Changeling was also a great episode because it dealt with the interaction of the characters trying to help each other.<br />With Richard Dean Anderson decreasing his part, and with Micheal Shanks absent, it fell to Amanda Tapping and Chris Judge to carry the season. They did an admirable job, but the team dynamics are what made this show what it was and you can't keep those dynamics with only 50% of said team.<br />I have all the seasons, so I had to have this one, But I'm anxiously waiting for Season 7!
B00005JMEW|3.0|The Film:<br />I just saw this movie for the first time on DVD. As a whole, this movie has amazing cinematography and creativity. It's a cool homage to old spaghetti westerns, Japanese samurai, anime, etc. I borrowed it from a friend, but I can see myself owning it since I like those kinds of films with over the top violence. You can't take it too seriously, because it's not done realistically, and it's fake from the get-go. That's part of its charm.<br />On the other hand, Quentin Tarantino tends to use overly crass subject matter and language just for the sake of being crass. Fans of Tarantino would probably say, &quot;What do you expect? It's Quentin Tarantino!&quot; But I say, why is it needed? This movie was already good, and stuff like that doesn't enhance the plot. I don't mind movies that have some language and/or crass subject matter if it's done tastefully and at a bare minimum. But the way Tarantino does it is just jarring. It stops the movie and prevents the plot from moving forward when it should. There's just too much language at times(and it's always the worst words used), and that scene with the two guys either raping or wanting to rape Black Mamba while she was in a coma is just sick. Granted, they didn't show anything (thank God), but their choice of words during that dialog that went on between them was just unsettling and it's something I'd rather not hear about. The subject is crass on its own, so it didn't even need that 5 minute bit of dialog with them talking about it. I have yet to find a good reason for that scene to even be there. It didn't enhance the plot at all. I'm absolutely positive that this scene, as well as most of the language could've been omitted and the film would've still be great(probably better). Scenes like this, and over the top bad language insult my intelligence. The movie is perfectly fine without all that. Sorry if I have morals (actually, I'm not sorry), but some things are just better left out.<br />Thankfully, most of the crude language and subject matter was gone after that, and we got a magnificent blood bath of a movie with excellent choreograpy for the fight scenes, wonderful cinematography, and fun homages to Japanese samurai movies, anime, spaghetti westerns, etc. The plot was clever and witty when the movie actually focused on the plot.<br />The DVD:<br />The film had a good sharp picture. The sound was well balanced too. However the special features are very lacking. I suppose that's because there's a special edition coming out in the near future or something. The behind the scenes documentary on the making of the film was informative, but not much more than Quentin Tarantino and his big ego yapping away at how &quot;good&quot; he is. The 5,6,6,8s &quot;music&quot; video was crappy. They're a crappy band that works for the mood of the film, but they're not enjoyable for a special feature that soley focuses on them.<br />Good movie, Okay DVD.of the crude language and subject matter was gone after that, and we got a magnificent blood bath of a movie with excellent choreograpy for the fight scenes, wonderful cinematography, and fun homages to Japanese samurai movies, anime, spaghetti westerns, etc. The plot was clever and witty when the movie actually focused on the plot.<br />The DVD:<br />The film had a good sharp picture.

B0001NBMBC|5.0|When i first listened to this CD i was pretty shocked to hear acoustic songs on a slipknot album, i was expecting to hear an album similar to IOWA. They still have that heavieness they've always had but don't think this is an album for some hardcore IOWA fans cause this is alot more melodic and may have a little mainstream hear and there. For those of you who think there is some stone sour influence on this album.... well your absolutley right it does!!!! I think this album has more varity and tone than there prevoius albums and i think they sound alot better.<BR>I think that if your a true slipknot fan and have an open mind about this album i think you'll love it as much as there previous releases.

0679311718|5.0|You are immersed in a year of the most extreme human suffering and unbelievable abilities of Romeo Dallaire with his staff and soldiers to continue to engage in their effort in the middle Rwanda's mutilation, rape, murder, massacre (genocide).<br />This effort in the middle of what is impossible to imagine happening all around them with no help from the world makes you want to scream and cry with anger and extreme sadness at how in &quot;modern&quot; times human beings have the ability to do such things to other human beings. <br />What is incredible is that Romeo Dallaire could recount this year in his life and retain his grip on life. An amazing insight on how hate, brutality and apathy create human tragedy and make you want to help while truly appreciating what you have.<br />God bless people like Romeo Dallaire who have the ability to represent humanity in the face of inhumanity, David against Goliath.
0449002632|5.0|I have been a voracious reader since I can remember and this is absolutely the best book I have ever read! Bear in mind that I love works that traverse family history across generations and I am a tranplanted Briton in the US, but this book is utterly brilliant. Rutherford creates such a crystal clear picture of life within this cosmopolitan city from the dawn of time to modern day. It is a substantial read and even though you won't want to put it down, you may be force to occasionally - for sleep! It took me a couple of days to read and I felt lost after I read the last line. The plot cleverly weaves characters and their families across many generations, showing how wealth and status can rise and fall easily with a twist of fate. I was fascinated and throughly engaged with the historical details included in each time period. This is a book you will never forget. Highly recommended!
B0000AQVCL|4.0|Jet is a wonderful new band that I discovered several months ago. I bought Get Born and absolutely love it. The band reminds me so much of the Beatles yet they bring a more modern sound to rock and roll. My favorite songs on the album include Are You Gonna Be My Girl, Rollover DJ, and Look What You've Done. I strongly recommend this CD!
B00020QIKY|2.0|Seeming like a million years ago, this substandard sophomore album by Eminem's tag alongs, leaves us wishing for Devil's night.  I was very suprised by that first album.  It was creative but not searching, violent and crude and sick and new.  D 12 World meets none of these requirements.  Most of the songs are like, eh.  Most of them are like, &quot;big deal&quot;.  I was bored by the time my band came on and it isn't even that good of a song.  Poor your forty out was decent, but I kept waiting for lil' John to come on the track.  Steal this album if you get a chance because if you buy it D 12 will owe you.

B00004Y6RO|5.0|This is the best slipknot cd to date and here is what I think of the CD:<br />742617000027: It is a pretty spooky intro for (SIC) but I wouldn't listen to this track over and over again. 7/10<br />(SIC): Great opening for this CD and a good guitar line. 10/10<br />Eyeless: This is a nice headbanging song but kind of gets boring after listening to it a lot. 9.5/10<br />Wait and Bleed: COREY IS ACTUALLY SINGING IN THIS ONE very good song. 9/10<br />Surfacing: I would say that this song is better album version than live-Mick has the greatest guitar opening in this one. 10/10<br />Spit It Out: JESUS CHRIST I would give this 20/10 but i can't go over rate. Corey is pissed off right here! 10/10+<br />Tattered and Torn: Nice gothic sounding but not to much of a rocking song. 7/10<br />Me Inside: I love this song   that is all i have to say. 10/10<br />Liberate: Again sounds better here than live. 9.5/10<br />Prosthetics: Verry spooky sounding in the beginning but gets into gothic headbanging. 10/10<br />No Life: This is a very good song but not the best. 9/10<br />Diluted: I would say that it was evolved from Interloper but it is good (Interloper is better) 8/10<br />Only One: I would have to say that this isn't a very good song to me. 6.5/10<br />Scissors: Too frigging long!!! 5/10<br />Get This: LYRICS ARE BAD BUT THE SONG IS ROCKING. 10/10+<br />Spit It Out(Remix): Original is better but this sounds like a demo. 9/10<br />Wait and Bleed(Terry Date Remix): This is pretty good too. 9.5/10<br />Interloper: HERE IT HAS COME the greatest song on the cd  the head hancho the big cheese. 10/10+++<br />Despise: The &quot;My state of mind gets so one-sided&quot; and &quot;HANDSONMYFACEOVERBEARINGICANTGETOUT&quot; were good  but i love this song also. 10/10<br />Surfacing: Didn't bother listening to it because i don't really listen to live stuff on cd. 7/10<br />I would give this cd a 10/10+

B00009TB5G|5.0|The Lord of the Rings the Two Towers is an incredable adventure story. It leads you right back into the story from where you left off in The Fellowship of the Ring. Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom, Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Ian McKellen make this movie the greatest adventure of our time. The special edition makes it even better by adding in scenes that are a thrill to watch. Some even help to understand the movie more. I really enjoyed this movie and I hope and believe you will too.
0783225857|5.0|Not only do you get one of the great films of all time, you also get the documentary about the film and its impact on the general public.  The film is about a man's priciples to defend a black man who is accused of rape during the Great Depression.  The film is also about growing up and facing lifes realities.  This work is truly beautiful and has held up every bit as good as when it was first released.  The film also follows the book very closely and does a wonderfull job of adapting the masterpiece.  <br />The DVD has running commentary from the film makers as well as an exclusive documentary about the film.  This project could not been done better.  It is part of my personal film library and is truly a great addition.

B00000331V|5.0|I saw the band perform at the Worcester Centrum on Jan. 2, 1983.  To this day the best concert I've ever seen.  <br />They started out with their more current pop-hits like Centerfold.  After the Mayor came out and gave them the keys to the city, the Mighty J. Geils Band played the good stuff (this album and Full House) deep into the night.  <br />I don't think my rear-end touched the seat once during the entire concert.  I dare you to try sitting still while listening to songs like `Back to Get Ya.'
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Avril Lavigne is a great singer and has put out another great cd, this time writing her own music.  I find that most of the people who have written negative reviews don't seem to have much variety in their musical tastes.  I listen to and appreciate many different types of music.  I love Aerosmith, the Cure, the Counting Crows, Radiohead and, yes, Avril Lavigne.  There is more than enough room in the world for all types of music.  Just because it's different from what you normally listen to doesn't mean it's &quot;bad&quot;.  You people need to start expanding your horizons and enjoy life and music in all it's various forms.
B0001Z53AQ|3.0|I've been a fan of Eminem since th 90's, but this is disappointing.  This album neither matures from Devil's Night nor follows suit in wit and humor.  It's not a bad album but it is not the accomplishment that other Shady records have been.  Save your money or better yet spend it on Immortal Technique.  He's just as twisted as Em but also has th political viciousness of Dead Prez. Or use your money to get Keith Murray's Enigma.  He's a lot like Em except Keith came first and he has a broader vocabulary.  Or go and buy a any CD from Em's biggest influence, Ice.  It's a shame because D12 ARE a force to be reckoned with, just not on this album.  Some of these songs were on their undeground &quot;Bootleg This Album&quot; which is one of hip hop's funniest CD's ever.

I'm sorry but if Neverwhere is one of Gaiman's bests then Pratchett carried him in Good Omens.  There is no way a sane person liked Neverwhere and didn't love Good Omens.  Unless of course you hate to laugh and have a good time; then I could see it.  <br />Buy this book.  (Or better yet, get it from the library.)
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Somehow I feel like I shouldn't like this album.  I'm an almost forty African-American male.  Yet this Under My Skin is a prime example of probably my favorite type of music: that angry, angsty girl rage pop.  Now that Courtney Love has become a bad joke &amp; Alanis has mellowed, Avril is the leader in this music.<br />There are so many great songs here, but my favroite is probably #5 HOW DOES IT FEEL.

What I like most about these special releases is the triva track option that can run at the bottom of the screen without blocking out any of the screen itself.     This version of \\"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan\\", is a 2 disc set that will live long & prosper. Steady as she goes, Mr. Sulu.
0767830555|5.0|Every film class should have TAXI DRIVER on it's agenda:  This is an exercise in cinematic symbolism.  The steam rising from the manhole covers suggesting NYC houses the gates of Hell;  The .44 Magnum;  The long apartment hallway shot with Travis on the telephone to Betsy (being rejected);  The rally at Columbus Circle...it goes endlessly.  This tale of urban angst and desperation is an all time classic.  The Bernard Hermann score (his last) stands on its own pillar of greatness.  One of Scorsese and DeNiro's best works and without question the best film from 1976.
B00003CX5P|5.0|It needs to be like The Matrix. It needs to be like Lord of the Rings. These are the things I hear a lot. Well Star Wars is not Lord of the Rings nor is it The Matrix. In fact I'm glad it's not like those movies. That's not what GL was going for any ways. <br />This is a very good movie. :)
0790729725|5.0|John Wayne and John Ford had the great calvary trilogy in the 1940's.  Ford knew the American West like no other, so it was only natural that he immortalize it on film.  Ford was idolized by Scorsese (THE SEARCHERS are featured in the movie theatre sequence in MEAN STREETS), and Marty is the undisputed champion of mob movies.  Let him emulate the master with his mob trilogy. With 1995's  CASINO, now 2/3rds complete.  GOODFELLAS is a masterwork that yet again redefined American gangster films (holding the crown until DONNIE BRASCO set its own mark in 1997).  The superstar set, both in front and behind the camera are present.  There are few aside from Nicholas Pileggi who can ink underworld tales and only players like DeNiro, Pesci (brutally horrific as Tommy) and now Ray Liotta (this role made him a star) can bring them to life in all their vileness.  And of course there is the trademark Scorsese camera angles to add to the already powerful aura:  the run through the kitchen of the Copa and DeNiro standing at the edge of the social club's bar:  Cream's \\"Sunshine Of Your Love\\" blasting behind him.  Marty's telling of John Gotti would be the appropriate point on the triangle. Just as they did with TAXI DRIVER in 1976, and RAGING BULL in 1980, the Academy again played it safe and denied this Scorsese classic the best picture Oscar for 1990. That's a trilogy Hollywood should regret.
B00020HEL6|5.0|I am awestruck! Renee ROCKS! No other word for it. This chick has got the goods! When a superstar comes along we always know it: The 1980's had Madonna, the 90's had Celine, and the 2000's are soon to have Renee. You just watch: When she makes the cover of Rolling Stone it's gonna be their biggest seller in history. Go out and get this CD ASAP, you won't be disappointed. There's something amazing in for everybody no matter what their musical taste. How else do you explain a complete non-jazz fan like me listening to it over and over?
0060012218|5.0|With his debut novel, Geography Club, Brent Hartinger has created a sharp, witty, and touchingly realistic look into the lives of modern gay high school students. Russel has never knowingly met another gay person in his small town. He firmly believes he's the only gay kid at his high school, and in fact, feels like he's a spy in enemy territory. When he stumbles across a gay chat room set up just for his town, he's shocked to meet another gay student from his school. They agree to meet and much to Russ' surprise, the other gay student is none other than Kevin, a popular jock.<br />That information is just too much to keep to himself so he risks coming out to Min, his best friend. Min shocks him making a confession of her own: she has a girlfriend, soccer-playing Terese. The four of them, along with Terese's activist friend Ike, decide to get together to talk about all they have in common. But where? There's seems to be no safe place that jocks, activists, and self-described intellectuals can meet together without drawing suspicion in the clique obsessed society of high school. That's when they come up with the idea to form the Geography Club. \\"We just choose a club that's so boring, nobody in their right mind would ever in a million years join it.\\"<br />The idea works at first, but when another student suddenly, and rather inexplicably, wants to join, things start to unravel. Things are further complicated by Russ' rocket-fast trip from the respectable edges of society to popularity. He suddenly finds himself faced with decisions and situations he's never imagined for himself. Will he make the right choices? What will he do to hang on to his newfound status?<br />Hartinger tackles the difficult and treacherous landscape of high school society with startling realism. I kept expecting his characters to act in the typical \\"after-school special\\" fashion for which the first part of the book seems to set them up. Much to my surprise (and pleasure) he doesn't take the easy way out. His characters feel real, and that means they don't always do the \\"right\\" thing. Hartinger's writing style, aimed specifically at young adults, is extremely accessible, and the book is a quick, but satisfying read. I think it's safe to say that we can expect more great things from Brent Hartinger, and I look forward to reading his newest release, the non-gay themed Last Chance Texaco.y way out.

B0001UL7RY|5.0|This CD is great. You could listin to it all day. It has a mix of pop dark and rock songs with pianos and gutars. Defaniyly better than the first.

B0001NBMBC|4.0|Overall, this is a great 3rd record from Slipknot. Yes, there are some new styles mixed in there, but overall the frenetic chaos that fans are accustomed to is still there. My biggest complaint about this record is the mixing. I had high hopes when I heard that Rick Rubin would be producing this album, but in my opinion, the mix is sorely lacking in &quot;punch&quot;. I think that this is primarily why some of the hardcore fans are complaining about the &quot;new style&quot; of Slipknot. If these same songs were tuned and mixed to be like the first two records, I would have given this record 5 stars. I can never understand why a band mixes a record that ends up sounding COMPLETELY UNLIKE their live show. I went to the Jagermeister tour earlier this year and Slipknot's live sound is amazingly heavy and literally pounds you in the chest. For example, &quot;Pulse of the Maggots&quot; is an incredible song live, but on the record comes off as somewhat weak. Why can't slipknot be as heavy on their record as they are in real life? If this record could be remixed with some more bass and sonic punch, it would have been perfect.
B00005JN0A|4.0|If you're looking to see Michelle Trachtenburg topless or nude you can forget about.  What you see in the promo is want you get.  Maybe in her next movie.  Gagekeeper only reviews movies for sex, violance and nudity.  If you want to know more about this movie, read other reviews.
B00003CXGG|3.0|Why is it that movies with Kung Fu elements never really satisfy, except of course for the Matrix and Crouching Tiger. The authors of the story have tried to make a modern day Romeo and Juliet, in this case Asian Jet Li and black Aaliyah. This is all fair and well, but there is no real story to it. They come together, are good and survive in the end.<br />Thankfully there are some very good Kung Fu scenes by Jet Li which makes it fun. where Jackie Chan is more comedy, Jet Li is certainly art and well choreographed. The scene when he is playing football is a good one, the other is where he beats up some dudes with a hose.<br />With an hour and 50 minutes it's too long, so just skip to the fighting parts on the DVD.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|O.K.  Personnally this has automatically become one of my favorite Albums of all time and I think Avril is doing just fine.  Her music, her voice, and her talent are incredibly great and mature for her age, there are many rock bands that are out there that have been around for a long time and don't even come close to sounding as good as she does.  But some of the reviews I just read shock me.  This is a really good album that deserves a chance to be listened to at least 2 or 3 times before judging it or her so harshly.  She is rock, nothing else (not pop or punk!) and for those that wrote up stupid comments about absolute great bands such as Aerosmith and Rush (Rush who are also Canadian with 30 years of great music under their belts) while reviewing her need to step back and get a life!
B00003CXCT|5.0|I have heard there are changes that have been made to make these movies match with the prequels visually and story wise. Let's hope so! <br />Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope: <BR>1.The Imperial March has been added to Darth Vader's first <BR>appearance on Princess Leia's ship. 2.The lightsaber effects have been redone and the frame jumps of lightsabers being turned on has been removed. 3. There's a new scene which has been shot during the filming of Episode III in which the Emperor dissolves the Senate. 4. The bleeding arm on the floor in the Cantina has been replaced with a non-bleeding arm because it's now canon that lightsabers cauterize wounds. 5. The original shooting scene between Han and Greedo has been restored. 6. When the Death Star destroys Alderaan there's a new scene of Yoda's reaction to the disturbence in the Force that is created by all those deaths and then it cuts to Obi-Wan reacting to it as <BR>well. 7. Temuera Morrison's voice is being recorded for <BR>use with all the stormtroopers and Boba Fett in all the movies. 8. The Obi-Wan/Vader duel has been remade. A modified version of Duel of the Fates is being considered for the scene. 9.The Death Star battle is more epic  10. There's a new scene with Vader goes to Coruscant in the same building at the end of Attack of the Clones and inform the Emperor of a new potential who is strong in the Force. 11. Chewbacca now gets a medal.<br />Star Wars: Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back <BR>1.The battle of Hoth is enhanced with a ground battle between the Rebel soldiers and stormtroopers 2. Ian McDiarmid has refilmed scenes as the Emperor. The conversations between Vader and Palpatine is now longer and features a few connections to the prequels. 3. Yoda's face is now animated in CG allowing more expression of emotions.<br />Star Wars: Episode VI: Return of the Jedi<BR>1.Jabba the Hutt is now a combination of the puppet and <BR>CGI. 2. The Rancor is CGI 3. Yoda is CGI. Yoda disappears leaving his clothesbehind like Obi-Wan now. 4. The  love theme Across the Stars is inserted when Luke is talking with Leia about their mother. 5. In the battle of Endor there are thousands of Ewoks and they are more vicious 6. Lightsaber effects shadows on the floor are gone. 7. During Anakin's death scene it starts with a sad rendition of the Imperial March and slowly evolves into Anakin's Theme. 8. Sebastian Shaw who played Anakin when he was unmasked has been replaced with Hayden <BR>Christensen. 9.Anakin's spirit is now played by Hayden Christensen.
B000268QB2|4.0|Keane's latest effort, Hopes &amp; Fears, is an inconsistent, yet startlingly refreshing blast of fresh air on the stale pop scene.  <br />First, Keane eschews guitars.  Given that I'm a general fan of guitar-based rock, I would have guessed that I would've been disinclined to appreciate their music: WRONG!  Loved it.<br />Second, as stated in other reviews, both the vocal and writing quality of Keane is, at its best, marvelous.<br />However, there is wide birth between the best songs(Somewhere Only We Know, Everybody's Changing and Bedshaped) and the rest of the pack.  <br />Hopefully the next CD will bring a more uniform level of brilliance to their tracks. Regardless, bottom line: buy the CD.
0618526412|1.0|I've read so many of Oprah's book selections and for the first time - I am truly disappointed.  <br />I am unable to finish the novel.  It moves slowly, and I catch myself losing focus while reading.  Sure, I get the connection with the characters and the writing is pretty good but it is extremely dull and tedious to read.  I feel like I'm back in HS torturing myself to read a book.  This is not what reading is supposed to be.  <br />After reading these reviews I guess I'll just read the last page to see what happens.<br />Sorry Oprah!
B0000027RL|5.0|I think i'll start this off with a little pet peeve of mine:<BR>Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Nirvana, Pearl Jam...these two bands seem forever inseperable, now why is that? Maybe it is because too many people are hung up on the fact that A) both were based out of Seattle, and B) that both were grunge. But what is grunge? just a sterotype, or the mould in your bathroom. Nirvana were punk/rock; Pearl Jam were an incarnation of the better days of classic rock: no comparison there. I love both these bands, but for different reasons, and their styles are so different, to compare them is just stupid.<BR>now, on with the review!<BR>this album, to put it simply, is classic. if you love good rock, i recommend it highly. someone mentioned that it seemed too polished, but I don't detect that much of a different production in the sound than the likes of say, Nevermind. (oh no, i contradicted myself by comparing them!) It is not grunge, i don't know what is, i have always despised the term. it's just good ol' rock here. one of the tracks that stands out most in my mind has to be Black. most people here have referred to it as a &quot;ballad&quot; which kind of offends me! when i think &quot;ballad&quot; i think Mariah Carey and 98 degrees. this song, is amazing. it was what changed my opinion of the band from being just another rock act, to being well...amazing! the song is full of pain, beauty and something else that only Pearl Jam has. all in all, this is a great album that i recommend to rock fans of all ages.
0767817478|1.0|this looks like a jurassic park movie instead of a godzilla movie. this movie fails miserably its got good special effects, bad acting, terrible leading performances, and is way too long. unlike the other godzilla movies this movie is no fun at all. go rent the original one instead
B00005RJ1U|5.0|I just wanted to say that Jeepers Creepers was a great Movie, The movie had alot of action and the characters where great too. One of the parts that I really enjoyed was when he was acting like a scare crow and the woman with the cats seen that it was not her scare crow and she shot at him. And also how he would not die even when they ran over him about 20 times. This movie was awesome and so was the second. I hope that they make a third, but I think on this movie they probably kill him, because we don't want so many parts like the way jason was. So all I have to say is that both of the movies where great.
B00008S2VG|2.0|I can't give this record more than 2 stars. Madonna isn't that great of a singer. Her music was pretty decent at one time. Even though she never had a real singer's voice--just 1 octave. But her songs at least were danceable, if not lightweight fare. Too bad she couldn't repeat that on AL. It's just mediocre and nothing special. It's pretty boring to listen to. It's now stored in the very back of my CD collection..
B00005M989|3.0|The problem with this album isn't the selection per se, (although excluding Erotic City is a major faux paus) it's that all of the songs are butchered. It's as though someone had a stopwatch going and when they reached the limit, they faded out the song. The songs  are not even the radio mix in many cases. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.
B000006ZDQ|5.0|Ronnie James Dio succeeded Ozzy Osbourne as the lead vocalist of Sabbath, &amp; to everyone's surprise, Sabbath lost none of it's thunder. As a matter of fact, Sabbath actually became a better band for it. Dio's vocals added a new dimension to the band &amp; gave them more of an aura of mystery. Dio is heavy metal's Maestro of the Heavy Metal voice par excellence.<br />Tony Iommi, Bill Ward &amp; Geezer Butler lost none of the power that made them great as part of heavy metal's most enduring bands. Iommi's guitar still sounded as potent as ever. <br />HEAVEN &amp; HELL is indeed a must-have for metal fans everywhere.
B000268QB2|5.0|This is the best record I've heard this year, or perhaps since the past 2 years. The songs are truely wonderful, no wonder that the best musicians/bands come from the U.K., no offense to the American bands, simply I like uk bands more. To everyone reading this, stop reading and go buy this album. Then, close your eyes and let it flow.....It's an awsome experience!
B000002KDO|5.0|MASTER OF REALITY is Black Sabbath's third album, &amp; simply put, one of the greatest heavy metal albums of all time. This is one moment that everything came together for the band. Ozzy, while not a great  technical singer, sounds amazing in this album. His vocals range from menacing (Lord of this World, After Forever, &amp; Into the Void), to melancholy (Solitude). Tony Iommi's guitar playing is superb as always. Geezer Butler &amp; Bill Ward's groundbreaking foundations in this album is amazing. <br />Black Sabbath's musical output to the heavy metal genre is outstanding &amp; with this album, it cemented their position as one of the icons of the genre.
B0001HLVS2|5.0|&quot;Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World&quot; is one of the finest naval films ever made. The battle sequences are outstanding, the visual effects exceptional (You could never tell where they used CG and model effects), and the acting top-notch. Russel Crowe delivers a powerful performance as Captain &quot;Lucky&quot; Jack Aubrey, and is given a strong supporting cast that includes Paul Bettany (&quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot;) and Billy Boyd (&quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; Trilogy).<br />The single-disc DVD offers few extras, but the film is given great picture and sound. Whether you're buying the two-disc set, or the single disc edition, &quot;Master and Commander&quot; is a movie not to be missed!<br />Movie/DVD Grade: A+

B000002B7M|5.0|Released in 1980, this was Ozzy Osbourne's first record in his solo career, and his most popular.<br />After being kicked out of Black Sabbath for disorderly conduct, Ozzy Osbourne set out to find instrumentalists for his new solo band. First off, he hired former Quiet Riot guitarist Randy Rhoad,Don Airey on keyboards, and Tommy Aldridge on drums. With his lineup complete, Ozzy and Co. set out to make the album that would eventually become Blizzard of Ozz. Ironically, being kicked out of Black Sabbath was Ozzy's blessing, as he found much greater success in his solo career, and Black Sabbath made Heaven and Hell with Dio, one of their best albums if not the best.<br />Released in 1980, this record immediately received rave reviews from critics, impressed at the mastery of Rhoads' guitar playing and Ozzy's soul-searching vocals, and the sheer amount of variation in the songs, from all-out rockers like &quot;Crazy Train&quot; to melodic ballads like &quot;Goodbye to Romance&quot;. Although Blizzard of Ozz only got as high as #21 on the Pop Album charts, and &quot;Crazy Train&quot; only charted as high as #9 on the Mainstream Rock charts, This CD's legacy still lives on today with such radio staples as &quot;I Don't Know&quot;, &quot;Crazy Train&quot;, and &quot;Mr. Crowely&quot;.Unfortuneatly, this album was greeted by angry parents because of such songs as &quot;Suicide Solution&quot;, and that's what originally hurt sales. With Randy Rhoads legendary Guitarmanship, he equaled and even beat out Eddie Van Halen for the best guitarist, and even though he only made two albums with Ozzy, Blizzard of Ozz and Diary of a Madman, his legacy is still as pronounced today as it was in the 80's. So is this CD overrated or is it truly a classic that should be owned by everybody? Truly it is a classic, and read below for song ratings to see why.<br />Track Ratings:<br />I Don't Know-10/10:Starts off the album perfectly, introducing the listener with an insane riff by Rhoads that Ozzy perfectly dishes out his vocals over. The Chorus is great, and at about 2 minutes 30 seconds in, Ozzy dramatically changes the song with a ballad-like quality, but then he quickly switches back to the full-throttle rocking! Good musicianship!<br />Crazy Train-15/10:Who hasn't heard this? Played at football games around the world, it truly is hard not to hear. Starts off with Rhoads' legendary riff and Ozzy's &quot;Aye Aye&quot; that perfectly starts the song off with a bang. Great chorus, and maybe the best guitarmanship on the whole album.Perfect solo by Rhoads, and it shows why he was one of the best soloists out there.<br />Goodbye to Romance-10/10:For all you ballad-haters out there, this happens to be one that you might like! With the Soul-searching melody and Ozzy's brooding vocals, this song makes you feel like you want to cry. A great chorus(&quot;Goodbye to Romance, Goodbye to friends&quot;), and a solo by Rhoads that fits the tone perfectly. One of the best ballads out there PERIOD!<br />Dee-8/10:A tribute to Randy Rhoads' mother, it shows a softer side to Rhoads with a heartfelt solo off an acoustic guitar. Gets downgraded because its only 50 seconds long.<br />Suicide Solution-9/10:Really good lyrics from Ozzy, and this is the song that angered many parents because of its slightly mature lyrics, but really they overdid it. Ozzy's vocals sound sardonically sarcastic, and it really enhances the song's dark tone. Gets downgraded for a lack of a good solo from Rhoads, but he does play a killer riff.<br />Mr. Crowely-10/10: The Organ solo rocks! The organ solo perfectly develops &quot;Mr. Crowely&quot;'s dark and mysterious tone, and Ozzy's haunting vocals truly make this a song perfect for any horror flick. Great solo from Rhoads, and the solo clocks in at about 40 seconds long.<br />No Bone Movies-10/10: I don't understand why people say this is a filler song! This is a flat-out tough rocker with Ozzy's sarcastic vocals and an absolutely lovable riff from Rhoads, with a great solo coming in about 1 minutes and 45 seconds in. Aldridge's drumming is also a highlight here,as his drumming sounds more pronounced than on most tracks.<br />Revelation(Mother Earth)-10/10:A slow ballad that tries to warn people about the end of the world, it's a very soulful song that would fit in any horror movie. Gets harder as it goes along,with a superb solo from Rhoads and great keyboarding.<br />Steal Away(The Night)-10/10: Another hard rocker that never fails to please, this is probably the fastest song on the album, and Rhoads' riff is pure bliss. Great Chorus and killer solo, as usual.<br />Overall, Blizzard of Ozz is nearly perfect, with &quot;Dee&quot; being it's only low point, but that's only because it's 50 seconds long. This album perfectly shows us why Ozzy Osbourne and Randy Rhoads' names have lived on for over 20 years, and their legacy on Rock N Roll will never be forgotten. If you are a fan of Rock in General, you should already have this album or be ordering it off Amazon now.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!PERFECT FOR ROCK FANS AND THIS IS THE ALBUM TO BUY IF YOU ARE TRYING TO GET INTO OZZY!EVEN THOUGH THIS ALBUM IS AWESOME, CHECK OUT DIARY OF A MADMAN IF YOU WANT TO SEE A TRULY SUPERB CD!

B000002UAO|4.0|After the less than auspicious opening of \\"Drive My Car,\\" RUBBER SOUL hits its stride with the wondrous \\"Norwegian Wood,\\" the plaintive cry of \\"You Won't See Me,\\" and the alienation of \\"Nowhere Man.\\" Things drop off a bit with Harrison's predictable \\"Think for Yourself\\" and the grating organ and high pitched vocals of \\"The Word,\\", but starting with cute \\"Michelle,\\" to the stalker's anthem \\"Run for your Life,\\" The Beatles are in top form. Playing with country, rockabilly, and even Tin Pan Alley, The Beatles really enter the realm of originals on RUBBER SOUL. While not as groundbreaking as REVOLVER and SGT. PEPPER, RUBBER SOUL definitely sends the message that this band is not really like anybody else.

There's still the playfulness of a pop band here, but you start to hear the beginning of the sound that brought the Beatles to the next level. Still dependent on covers to fill things out, WITH THE BEATLES is the beginning of a different, better band.

It featured 13 Radio-Ready Songs, and was powered by the singles &quot;Complicated&quot; &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot; &quot;I'm With You&quot; and &quot;Losing Grip&quot;. Over the 2 years since her absence, she toured world wide gaining credibility as a performer and an artist. When she had gathered enough materials for her new cd, she began working with Chantal Krevaziuk- a fellow Canadian artist, and a very close friend of Avril's. Working once more with fellow band member- Evan Taubenfeld- they wrote her first single for her sophmore album, before the release of her first album, the anthem of the summer- &quot;Dont Tell Me&quot; And then came &quot;Under My Skin&quot;. When I purchased this album, I wasn't expecting the transition in vocals, writing, and music. Being a hardcore fan, I also understand the faults of &quot;Under My Skin&quot;, which are seriously, none. &quot;Let Go&quot; was the pop hit of the year, but &quot;Under My Skin&quot; is worthy of a Grammy. This guitar driven record, leaves most of her pop-roots behind, except in her first single, &quot;Dont Tell Me&quot; and embarks on a journey of respect as a musician. Working on every aspect of this record, from the String Arrangements, the Lyrics, the Piano, and of course the Guitar and Vocals, Avril Lavigne advances and deffinetly goes inside her skin to reveal the insecurities, problems, and relationships we never knew she had. Avril Lavigne's &quot;Under My Skin&quot; is sure to get under yours. <br />The track listing and rating is as follows;<br />1. Take Me Away- 4.5/5 <BR>2. Together- 4/5<BR>3. Don't Tell Me- 5/5<BR>4. He Wasn't- 4.9/5<BR>5. How Does It Feel?- 5/5<BR>6. My Happy Ending- *Second Single*-5/5<BR>7. Nobody's Home *collaberates with Ben Moody*- 5/5<BR>8. Forgotten-5/5<BR>9. Who Knows- 5/5<BR>10.Fall To Pieces-5/5<BR>11.Freak Out- 4/5<BR>12.Slipped Away- 5/5
0765310015|5.0|I have a hard time finding good books these days.  Authors like Feist, Salvator, Stackpole, and Douglass are just too light and feel too much like cotton candy (sticky, too sweet, and just for kids).  Kearney, Stover, and Cook are grittier and have more meat to them.  I will agree that Jordan and Martin are at the top of the pile, but I would only put Gammell at the same level as Erikson in scope or shear power for storytelling.<br />Overall, Erikson is definitely my favorite and I have ordered all four of the first four volumes in his series directly from Amazon in the UK, just because they were not available in the US.  If you enjoy depth, complexity, and passion in your reading, then you are in for a treat.  The plots are complex and the number of characters vast, but the result is infinitely more satisfying than most of the light stuff out there.
B00005RHGK|3.0|a very good movie until the creeper is seen and starts killing a lot. The creeper looks really stupid. The psychic was completly unneccessary.
B00028HBKM|5.0|This is a very excellent movie that will be viewed and debated far into the future.  I am amazed by the number of people who complain because the movie did not focus a whole lot on the teaching of Jesus.  The movie was about the PASSION of Christ.  The few teaching scenes included were enough to contrast the message of love and sacrifice of Christ with the world's message of cruelty and hate.  Without sacrifice there is no love. Christ made the most ultimate and sublime sacrifice.  Mr. Gibson deserves all respect for putting together a masterpiece. Hopefully those who would like to know more about the message of Christ will be inspired to pick up and read a copy of the gospels - start with the Sermon on the Mount, you will not be disappointed.
B00005JGAB|5.0|THE RAMONES WERE ONE OF THE GREATEST PUNK ROCK BANDS ALONG WITH THE CLASH AND SEX PISTOLS AND THIS WAS A GREAT CD FEATURING JUDY IS A PUNK AND BLITZKRIEG BOP.I LOVE THIS ALBUM AND RECOMMEND THIS AWESOME CD TO ALL LOVERS OF ROCK MUSIC.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Everybody should buy this CD because everybody can relate to what Avril's saying! Is there anybody who hasn't EVER felt, alone?, Cheated? Hurt? Excited? Avrils music helps us deal with those emotions and know we're not alone!!!! Shes there for us!
0385336810|3.0|This book gets off to a very slow start and is not as catching as Kinsella's Shopaholic series.  The story line isn't revealed until about half-way through the book when it finally gets interesting.
1400034779|5.0|It seems as though every time I finish a book, I take the book and cradle it to my chest, and close my eyes and reflect upon all that I have read, and if it is a good one, and in some way has changed the way I feel about life, I will have a smile on my face, and a sense of accomplishment.  This is how I felt when I finished this book :o)  It was open, honest and educational, and left me with a sense of calmness.....and a bit closer in touch with spirituality.  It was very easy to read and to follow along with.  Also a nice glimpse into a part of Africa :o)<BR> <BR>I liked the way the author Mr. Alexander McCall Smith developed his main character Mma (Mrs) Ramotswe.  In some incidences along the way, he had her &quot;get caught&quot; which to me, made her seem more human, and not some character that is always perfect.  Also there was a nice little twist when she encountered the young and clever Nandira.<br />The book also gave me a deep craving for some &quot;Red Bush Tea&quot; ~ <br />I would give this book a five star rating, and I will read more of Mr. Smith's books in the near future.  Also I would love to meet Mr. Smith in person if he ever comes close to any of the bookstores in my area~  I was also surprised that he knew so much about how the female mind works :o)
B00005RRG9|5.0|The movie's very entertaining on its merits, despite being a tad dated in the new millenium. However, in the perspective of the 60's, quite well done. The one thing that has ALWAYS bothered me about this movie and critical responses to it is the underlying fact that what these 'parents' did to their children, splitting them up, never letting either know about the twin or even seeing the other child for 12 years, is just HORRIBLE and, worse, is virtually a non-issue with the family. Yes, it is mentioned, but never truly explained nor could it be: such an action is never justified or defensible. This is also true of the recent remake, and perhaps Hollywood should concentrate a bit more on common sense, morality and true family values rather than 'entertainment.'
B00008ADPF|5.0|This is a oustanding album by Nickelback. I can't even say i did not like any of the songs they are all just outstanding. <BR>It is a must get album. <br />This is so short because i just can not think anything that is bad about it is great album
0788821075|5.0|Actors here are Brilliant, my thumbs are way up! I can watch this film over and over again. <BR>If Disney's Cinderella are every girls dream. Pretty Woman maybe every boys dream,Why? Because when Richard Gere discovered that He's working so hard to pin down other competitors in business, at the same time his Attorney (Jason Alexander)benefits from it, Money wise.<BR>Richard decided to follow his heart and continue falling in love with the Pretty Woman. So sad, Julia Roberts is a prostitute here but a good one, she even have several colors and flavors of condoms to choose from,That's safe sex! <BR>This is a great story plot a millionaire meets his match a prostitute with a golden heart.In reality prostitutes deserves a little break. As for the Pretty Woman this is a big break, Kudos!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|This is a classic example of what happens when a band continues to evolve and they're &quot;Fan&quot; base continues to stay in this adolesant Nu-metal puddle.  This Album rocks, most of you who hate this album are pissed because Mick and James finally got out of that Open Bb note style of playing, re-discovered the solo and with the help of Rick Rubin made a kick ass record that your crappy little nu-metal cover bands are too technically inclined to figure out how to play it. This album is awesome and for those of you who don't like it then you need to grow up and get with the program this is what Metal sounded like when it was good and thanks to Vol. 3, KsE, Machine Head, Chimara, and Fear Factory hopefully it keeps getting better and the final nail will put into the Nu-Metal Coffin for good.
B00004R99I|5.0|In reality Pocahontas was the wife of another white settler named John Rolfe. She later became Lady Rebecca. We can say she fell in love with John Smith but their love story didn't workout.<BR>The story of Pocahontas repesents us all Americans. That no matter how you look like, Black or White we are all foreigners on this land.The original Americans are the American Indians, cause they are already here when Columbus discovered America.As for this movie itself, I love it especially the music.
B000002V07|5.0|I first heard the song \\"fade into you\\" in the movie Angus during the scene where Angus and Melissa shared their first dance.  I remember being struck and thinking how beautiful the song was. Years later when my taste in music began to mature I stumbled upon Mazzy again and rediscovered the song.  Hope's voice is in my opinion the most beautiful and ethereal voice in rock and roll. \\"Blue light\\", and \\"Five String Serenade\\" are both hauntingly beautiful songs and whenever I hear \\"Into Dust\\" I feel as if I could cry.  \\"So Tonight That I Might See\\" is a nice little psychedelic number with a cool Celtic feel.  Not ever song is perfect though, \\"Wasted\\" seems  a little misplaced. I own every Mazzy album and there's just something about this one, like a certain tone in her voice that puts this album just a step above the rest. If I had to pick three cd's to save this would easily be my #1.  A must have for any true fan.
B0001ZX0OM|2.0|When I saw Kevin Bacon calling a woman of whom you could only see the lips, I thought the movie was a re-make of Wild Things, a cop-turned-gangster. As a non-native speaker of English, I missed important sections of the highly accented dialogues, and maybe that's why I'm so bitter about it. Sean Penn's English on 21 Grams was so clean...Some of the reviewers here watched this flick after the Oscars, others had read the book before. For me who did neither of those things, this film is a total flop. I never knew what was going on on the theatre screen. The scenes were unrelated most of the time, which on occasions reminded me of Magnolia, but this had things totally cleared up in the end. Mystic River left me utterly frustrated in the end. I couldn't make out what Celeste was feeling when she looked at other families reunited after hers had been shattered. Why wasn't her son waving back to her? Why did Sean make up with his ex-partner only after those confusing events? As I said, either I missed something or this movie doesn't deserve the Oscars it got. Watch it for yourself, maybe you look at things from a different perspective and you'll enjoy it. I didn't.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|I am always looking for new stuff to listen to, new sounds, new bands. This is one of the best cd's I have heard in a REALLY long time. The songs get stuck in your head, but instead of getting annoying like almost everything else, you just want to listen to it again. <br />The descriptions of the kinds of sound (Radiohead + others) is right on. There are not many bands out there that can create such a sound as Muse, and almost nobody that make that sound so riveting. They have set themselves far and above the modern American California punk sound that is finding popularity. If you dig the likes of Rooney, Phantom Planet, even the Strokes (not to bag on any of them), MUSE IS BETTER!<br />If you don't have this cd, get it!
B0001611DI|4.0|5 Stars for the film<BR>4 Stars for the DVD release (DiviMax)<br />Yes, this is a great DVD considering that, for years, Romero fans have had to put up with awful quality VHS versions, and even when they were good (Thorn-EMI's VHS of &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; was by far the most complete version of Romero's U.S. theatrical cut of the film) the films still suffered... not from image quality necessarily (DVD lends itself to a general cleanup of the image, and the copy is usually struck from master negatives or interpositives of the film direct from the vault), but from lack of things like... drumroll please: extra features.  Sure, VHS was not a format for such things, but then that format seems wickedly prehistoric nowadays.<br />For those that can wait-- and I totally urge this, because I think the practice of releasing DVDs without many extras as a run-up to a second &quot;expanded edition&quot; release to be tantamount to highway robbery -- there is indeed a full-blown multi-disc set coming out in September from Anchor Bay... it will be a bit more expensive, but what the heck... if you're a fan, and this film seems to be made for fans (of Romero's previous work and the horror/splatter genre in general) then it's worth the wait and the added dollars spent.<br />From the Anchor Bay website...<br />DAWN OF THE DEAD (1978) - MULTI-DISC SET <BR> <BR>There have been a few folks asking about this set, and soon we will be revealing the details of what promises to be the most extensive edition of any title in Anchor Bay's history!  Release date is September 7th, and you can expect multiple versions of the film as well as new commentary tracks and interviews galore.  Full Specs Coming in June!<BR>Starring: David Emge, Ken Foree, Scott Reiniger, Gaylen Ross - Director:  George A. Romero
078322608X|5.0|This is one of those movies which you almost hate watching, simply because it's so infuriating in that you know what will happen. You know (spoiler coming up) that Bruce Willis will fail, you know his recurring dream is his future, you realize that nothing will be changed as the characters inexorably go towards their own destruction. But still, you have to watch. I suppose this review sounds far too much like a bad car wreck, but the fact remains that this is one of the most enthralling movie of the 90's, and an excellent entry into the more serious works of Brad Pitt. An excellent movie, well worth repeated watching. Look for an extremely interesting Astor Piazzola piece.
B0000CFW87|5.0|Uplifting....<BR>I could go on forever with such words..do yourself a favour and listen. <BR>the boy is a genious with unmatched talent. <BR>a voice like this comes along once in a million life times..i am so glad it is in ours. there is definatly a place in this world for this.

B00000295Y|4.0|CH's album Black Sunday is my favorite CH album out of all of em'.  This has some cool tracks like track number 1,2,3,4,5 and Hits from a bong.<br />This is a classic Hip Hop album not to miss out on.<BR>Some songs are a little dull though.  But over all <BR>it's a good album to have.<br />Mixing the mind of old school rap CH manages to get it right <BR>with this album.  It's very good and some what enjoyable to have in the car.<br />Get it...
B00008J4P5|3.0|I don't thin that many people have the right idea about this album.  It's not a piece of crap, especially when you compare it to Good Charlotte and L'il John and those folks.  However, it is definitely not one of the best albums of all time.<br />Basically, here's the main problem I have with almost every song.  Jack White must have thought, &quot;Hey, that's a really catchy little beginning to a song.  But rather than go somewhere with it, I'll just repeat it for three minutes and make a song ot of it.&quot;<br />For example, Black Math had a catchy intro, but then it repeated the same thing power chords for the whole song, with a few different power chords thrown in for a few seconds.  And thus a potentially good song was ruined by repeating the same chords over and over again.  The solo wasn't bad, but, like all his solos, the almost always use the same scale.  I think it's a mixolydian scale.<br />Seven Nation Army: good bass riff, but you can't make a whole song, including a &quot;solo&quot; out of repeating the riff over and over again.  Or at least you shouldn't.  Seriously, a solo composed of variations on the main riff?  A good guitarist is constantly improvising and adding variations during the verses.<br />Ball and Biscuit was one of the songs I liked, and the solos were alright, but they used the same scale the whole time.  I mean, what would Since I've Been Loving You Be Like if Jimmy Page used exclusively the C blues scale?<br />The drumming isn't as repetitive as Bruce Springsteen, but it's really not that spectacular.  I mean, where are the fun fills?<br />So, if you don't mind a song that has a catchy beginning but then repeats the same thing over and over again, then this album is fine for you.  But if, like me, you are a musician who writes music and jams with friends for hours straight, then you will likely get irritated with the repetitiveness.<br />Elephant gave me a plan for a band.  Jack White writes the opening riffs, then we lock him up, and let Warren Haynes do the rest.  Then we get good starts to songs with *gasp* variation in the song.  And better solos.
0736041850|5.0|I've had this book for a while now, and time after time, even when I'm not looking for workout information, I just like to look at the amazingly drawn pictures that Mr. Delavier's book is filled with, simply because, I think it's a marvel. I can't begin to say how it has helped me concentrate on muscles during workouts, and retain perfect (or near perfect) form. That's quite important, and this book does deliver that. <br />I've had friends come over only to pick this book up and sit there, gazing like cows at an oncoming train. It's that good. I believe it's a must for someone who is strongly into weight training/ bodybuilding, or any of the names you prefer to use.
B000000993|5.0|A crushing blow from a powerful band, Undertow crystalizes the best of lyrics and guitar Tool has to offer.  From the haunting lows and shrieking highs of Sober, to the heartbeat-modifying bass in Prison Sex, this album attacks from all angles.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|A great follow up to her first album!  Another disc you can just pop right into your CD player and listen through to the end.
B00006RU5B|5.0|This Cd is outstanding! Easily one of the best of 2003. The band is mostly under the influence of the Soundgarden sound, but not  so much so that it is copying the style. I recommend this CD to all hard rock fans, and you WILL NOT be dissapointed.
1586210912|5.0|My life has changed after reading this book..<BR>It was about 3 years ago when I first read<BR>this book. And it changed my life forever..<BR>I was about 18 years old, I have just graduated<BR>from High school, and was in college trying<BR>to find the answer to my life.<BR>I wanted to become successful, but I didn't know<BR>what success really meant.<BR>Maybe becoming rich was, maybe feeling happy with<BR>my girl friend, my family, my friends, doing <BR>something what I like was.<BR>I didn't know, so I was searching for it.<BR>I thought about becoming a writer, I thought<BR>about becoming a chiropractor, becoming an<BR>athlete.  People told me Money is &quot;Evil&quot;, so don't even think about it. So I tried to ignore the money, only thought about happiness. But I found myself arguing with my girl friend about money,worrying about money.  I had to make so called &quot;Evil&quot; money to do what I liked. Then I realized, money is important. Money makes us happy or unhappy.  Money has power. when I read this book, I literally cried. Finding an answer in my life.  This book doesn't teach you how to &quot;make&quot; money. It teaches you how to &quot;think&quot; like Rich. After 3 years, I'm at the age of 21, I never have to work for money again. Money works for me.<BR>People who always try to find &quot;How to&quot; info. they never become successful, people who wants to know &quot;how to&quot; lose weight never lose weight. Before you &quot;do&quot;, you must &quot;be&quot; first. Everything takes time, and courage. Becoming successful is simple, it's not easy but simple. You only need persistance. That's it. If you wanna become World Karate champion, you just have to practice 12 hrs a day, breaking few bones, few teeth, bleed like hell that's it. It's simple. But Can YOU Do IT? Ask yourself. Mr.Kiyosaki changed my life.
B00004WLXZ|5.0|The Synapse DVD Special Edition surpassed all  expectations. I had Triumph of the Will on video prior to obtaining this DVD and the video's visual and audio quality was poor. By contrast,  this DVD is visually very crisp and sharp and the audio quality is fine  The DVD appears to be produced from an excellent original film print. I've seen another DVD  of TOTW produced by  different company, and its quality was the same as the video version :substandard. Make sure you get the Synapse version. This Special Edition is good as it gets.
6304698526|5.0|This film, has been till now the major achievement of Peter Yates, there are several reasons for this statement, a dazzling direction, the charismatic presence of Steve Mc Queen playing the role of an emblematic anti hero cop , the best car chase ever filmed in San Francisco, the spectacular beauty and talented Jacqueline Bisset, the presence of a raising promise as Robert Duvall, the sinister character of Robert Vaughn as the corrupt senator, supported by a fine script without any hole, plentty of suspense and multiple reflections, this film has generated many similar films but without its shinning power and dynamical force.<br />Do you need any adittional reason to acquire this one?<br />Don't miss, you don't have any excuse. You'll be always rewarded.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I loved the &#34;first&#34; STAR WARS (aka: EPISODE IV- A NEW HOPE). I saw it in the theatre in 1977 and couldn't believe the realistic space scenery! I was enthralled by Darth Vader and still consider him one of the coolest villains ever. Of course, I was a kid back then. I fell hook, line, and light-saber for the whole phenomenon. Today, I have to look at what I loved about the original trilogy, as well as what I hated. STAR WARS Episode IV- A New Hope- I love the wide-eyed wonder of it. I love Luke as a kid who stumbles into the greatest adventure of his life, quite by &#34;accident&#34;. Han Solo (Harrison Ford) as the rogue space-pirate type anti-hero guy. He's a cool foil for Luke's cream cheese goodiness. Princess Leia's (Carrie Fisher as the damsel-in-distress turned warrior was deceptively ahead of her time) is the perfect middle ground between the two male heroes. I loved them together as the flies in the empire's ointment. George Lukas drew from his childhood dreams, fantasies, and saturday afternoon movie serials to fashion a classic in it's own right. Episode IV stands as a milestone in not only special effects, but in sci-fi storytelling. It took something that seemed &#34;out there&#34; and made it accessible to folks like me (the non-sci-fi bunch). I loved Obi Wan (Alec Guinness). I loved The imperial ships, the death star, the land speeder, the Millenium Falcon, the sand people, the jawas, R2-D2, C-3PO, the goofy saloon scene, and even Leia's hairdos! I loved the whole bloody thing! I just can't find anything to hate about this first SW effort of Mr. Lukas.  -2004 DVD IMPROVEMENTS-&#62; Luke's landspeeder is more realistic, as it's underside has been cleaned up. lightsabers look much better! Mos Eisley revised to make it look more like a bustling hub than a ghost town! Unfortunately, Greedo still shoots first! Scene with Han Solo and Jabba The Hutt restored and vastly improved over 1997 version! Jabba looks more like himself, less like a mutated tadpole! Space scenes even more boffo than before! Scene with Luke's friend Biggs is restored! Deathstar explosion is extra cool! Then, in 1980 came Episode V- THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. No George behind the camera, and yet it is a great movie! Darker and far more ominous than it's predecessor, TESB features a growing, maturing Luke, a deepening (though guarded) chemistry between Leia and Han, and a gloom that slowly rises to ultimately engulf them all. This is my personal favorite SW flick. I love the ice planet Hoth, the snow monster encounter, and those beautiful imperial walkers! Vader is an unstoppable evil, bent on Luke's either joining him or being destroyed. The secrets revealed between them are legendary. Luke isn't as much of a boy, he's a young man. I love the dread and anguish in this installment. It makes it all seem real and inescapable. 2004 DVD IMPROVEMENTS-&#62; Probe droid looks better. Snowmonster has added scenes where it's eating Luke's TanTan! Snowspeeders no longer look &#34;cropped in&#34;. Imperial walkers look better too! Cloud city looks like it's actually there rather than an added model! Hologram of the Emperor changed from the goofy looking person in the original to the real guy (Ian McDiarmid)! Then, there's Episode VI- RETURN OF THE JEDI- I have mixed feelings about this one. I love the space battles. I love the speeders roaring through the forests like giant, fuel-injected mosquitoes. I love Jabba The Hutt's bulky nastiness, and Leia's bikini! I love Vader and that super-turd, The Emperor, of course. I love the plot and the way things turn out. However, I absolutely hate the stiff, nearly robotic way that Luke, Leia, and Han trudge through their scenes. The chemistry seems lost and Luke's Jedi-guru-I-Am-Buddha thing grates my last nerve! Then there's those cuddly, buy-me-at-your local-wal-mart Ewoks! I hated them in the theatre in '83, and I hate them now. Their part in the movie went on and on. I wanted the imperial troops to take most,if not all of them out! I hate the teddy bear planet! Die, Ewoks! Die!! There, I feel better now. My 8yo son loves the Ewoks though, and maybe that's the point. He's not old and jaded like his old man. Anyway, I still consider ROTJ to be a classic, just not as good as the other two in the trilogy. 2004 DVD IMPROVEMENTS-&#62; The Rancor has been cleaned up and looks fantastic! It looks like it's really after Luke, like it's really there, instead of an added claymation toy! That stupid-looking singer (you know, the walking belly with lips) in Jabba's lair has been replaced by a CGI version. Jabba's sail-barge looks great now! No longer a groaner! The pit-monster has been given a huge maw and extra tentacles. It looks menacing and hungry! The interior of the second death star is awesome! Watching the rebel ships fly through it now is even more thrilling! Like everyone, I've been waiting for these babies to be released on DVD! They are worth the wait! Lucas knew what he was doing afterall. To be able to own them all like this is something I've looked forward to for years. The Star Wars trilogy is essential viewing for anyone who has a child's heart and an imagination to match. I get a little less crusty every time I see them. I enjoy that far off galaxy and can never wear it out...
B0001NBMBC|3.0|They did not sell out but they did fail. They just dont got it any more. Its over for them. They lost there way. No other way to put it. They have put out every thing they had with Slipknot And Iowa. They were never a real great band. They were real they were pissed they had attitude. Now thats gone.
B000002UAO|4.0|No, not Rubber Soul, the guy who posts every fourth review citing the same Rolling Stone poll.  We got it man.<br />As for Rubber Soul, there are better Beatle albums, but it's OK.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|This film won the Academy Award as best original script. So there were a lot of reasons to watch it.<br />The result is disturbing. The first link I found is the huge influence of Michelangelo Antonioni (The eclipse)and Jim Jarmush (Mistery train), the script begins as a promise, and many expectatives; so in the middle of the film it happens nothing; the film falls in a hole: There isn't any brief clue about these strangers in the middle of Tokio; the loneliness and the no sense life is a issue so many times told. But I still hope for a twist in the script; the boring of Murray fills the half of the movie; ok, that{s the point, so what are you going to do? . Scarlett Johanson is the most remarkable point to review, a new promise talented actress so as the homagge to La dolce Vita of Federico Fellini ; remember that in Under the sun of Toscana there's another homagge to the same Fellini's work.<br />So the film remains between the hopeless, the memories and the huge crowd, the video games that mesmerizes to the young people against the adult clubs.<br />A overrated film; good locations in Tokyo and Kyoto; a post card movie.
B000002540|5.0|When surveying Blue Oyster Cult's catalog of live albums, it's apparent that each of these in-concert releases was carefully placed at a specific point in the band's career, to sum up or end a particular epoch. Such albums include \\"Some Enchanted Evening\\" (1978), \\"Extraterrestrial Live\\" (1982), and the recent triumph \\"A Long Day's Night.\\" Each live album balanced old and new material, describing the advances and new territories discovered, while making sure to note the material from previous eras that made the progression possible. 1975's \\"On Your Feet Or On Your Knees\\" was the first of these releases, an homage to BOC's first three albums (all of which were landmark recordings for the heavy metal genre), and a reliable testament to what kept this great band alive-loyal touring and performing.<br />The blazing fury on this album completely blows away many, if not most, live albums that came before it; in 1975, Peter Frampton's \\"Frampton Comes Alive\\" was still a year away, and artists were not yet mistaking his example and disguising greatest hits albums under the live album mask (though some bands did manage to make live albums a meaningful event). Some of the only concert recordings released before \\"On Your Feet Or On Your Knees\\" that had as much fire and energy were The Who's \\"Live at Leeds,\\" Deep Purple's \\"Made in Japan,\\" and Bob Dylan &amp; The Band's \\"Before the Flood.\\"<br />The focus on these songs should not be so much on melody as on the fact that each of these five men are playing their guts out. The extended guitar readings that dominate the album are pure heavy metal passion and a musical bond that few bands can perfect. A perfect example is `Seven Screaming Diz-Busters,' which features a searing guitar exercise in which drummer Albert Bouchard's driving drum beats are kept perfectly in time with the soaring guitar work, one musician in heavy metal harmony with another. And when BOC does show a hint of restraint, it is just as hypnotic; Donald \\"Buck Dharma\\" Roeser's `Then Came the Last Days of May' is one of the best songs written during their early era, a haunting but deceptively melodic tune about the futility and violence of the drug business. The collection closes on an appropriate note, a cover of `Born To Be Wild,' one of the songs that coined the phrase \\"heavy metal.\\"<br />Perhaps it's best that \\"On Your Feet Or On Your Knees\\" has not yet been fully remastered. The studio polishing would only take away from the raw sound that places the listener amidst the battalion of appreciative fans cheering for a band that were among the most unrelenting pioneers in heavy metal. As non-mainstream (for the 70s) as this music was, \\"On Your Feet Or On Your Knees\\" was Blue Oyster Cult's first album to break into the Top 30, a stunning document of the innovations to come; it is both the end and the beginning of an era.Roeser's `Then Came the Last Days of May' is one of the best songs written during their early era, a haunting but deceptively melodic tune about the futility and violence of the drug business.

B000002UDB|1.0|Horns, flutes, instrumentals and bad vocals.  How can one resist? There are lots of descriptives of this album, but &quot;masterpiece&quot; isn't one of them.  <br />The title song starts off with potential, but fades quickly, and most of the rest of the record is pretty forgettable, especially Hello Goodbye, and All You Need is Love which sound very outdated.
B00003CXCW|5.0|This movie belongs to the legend from its release. Never before Wilder got down to the deepest regions of the soul, like in this one.<br />A voice in off (William Holden) will be as introductory device to involve us in this gripping story about the loneliness of an old fashioned actress who lives only in her lost picture images.<br />In this sense it's worthy to name the only five films which have had a succesful exit about this no mercy theme.<br />These are: Cries and whispers, The silence and Persona (Ingmar Bergman), The anxiety of Veronica Voss (Rainer Werner Fassbinder) and American Beauty(from Sam Mendes).<br />The sense of loneliness grows progressively in this old lady, who decided to stop the physical time and create her own reality between the dark clouds of her ancient memories.<br />An eternal treasure of the american cinema and in my point of view the masterpiece of that film maker giant called Billy Wilder.
0375713751|2.0|I read this book because of the kids, unfortunately there wasn't enough about the kids to make it worth my while.<br />          A woman is torn between her job and her kids. She finds joy from both. In my opinion, there is no question about this. I feel the parent should stay with the children, especially while the children are young. It not only benefits the child, but also the adult.<br />          I had a difficult time getting through this book,<BR>mainly because the sentences were jammed too full, trying to prove that this woman was too busy. It didn't seem realistic.<BR>I gave this book a 2 and a half stars:)
0671027344|5.0|Possibly the best book I've ever read, The Perks of Being a Wallflower captures exactly what it is to be a teenager. The story itself is raw, Charlie one of the most honest characters I've come across in years. It is my belief that this book outdoes any other coming-of-age story I've ever read, even in its comparison to Catcher in the Rye. Perks is an insightful and vivid journey through the life of a high school freshman, and although people may think, 'There is no way a fifteen year old thinks that way,' there is. With the exception of Salinger, it was hard for me to imagine anyone truly understanding what it is to be a teenager unless they themselves are one, until I read this book. Chbosky has done a wonderful job, this book has changed the way I think and see the world - possibly my life - just in reading it. I love it! Let me also say thanks to the other reviewer who recommended The Losers Club by Richard Perez -- another good one.
B0000931QA|5.0|There are no punches pulled with this album.  Tate and company write a diatribe angry/dogmatic view of a protagonist who is brainwashed to murder certain individuals.  The world Queensryche writes is filled with &quot;slime&quot; and once we hear the first lyrics of revolution calling in the words of our new hero, you can't helped to be hooked and find out what happens next.<br />The story arc in this album is incredibly creative.  It is litteraly written better than most movies and screenplays you see on TV.  That's one of Mindcrimes pleasures, it's story has such a hook that you can't get enough of it.<br />Secondly it's the music.  The band litteraly plays to insane reaches of aggresion on this album and is firing on all cylinders.  When the killer tries to abandon the mission, the guitars and band drive faster (Needle Lies), the band and vocals can becoming sweeping and majestic as the assasin falls in love with a nun (Sweet Sister Mary), and how the whole story is set up in the title track, as a &quot;doctor&quot; explains the plans for our new hero.  The band put all its strengths together and came up with such a driving force they haven't been able to replicate since.  Every single track is litteraly like an exciting chapter in the best novel you ever read.  It's that good!<br />WOW!!  Just writing this makes me even appreciate this disc even more.  An absolute MUST have for any music fans collection.
B00003CX8N|5.0|In the great brittish tradition of similar items as A brief encounter or The Browning version, we find this treasure in the middle of the eighties.<br />Only the overwhelming presence of two giants actors as Mrs. Bancroft and Sir Hopkins could this work was a winner.<br />The film presents multiple challenges that only two legendary actors as them were capable to play and even go far beyond the script.<br />The script talks about the fraternity and the reciprocal admiration that these two long distance friends feel, their letters are a powerful inspiration motive to reveal much more issues than a simple intelectual exchange of wisdom and points of view.<br />The hidden feelings of love are suggested with elegance and nuance, a wonderful sense of rapture without affection, in that sense this relationship reminds me to Clara Schumann and Johannes Brahms.<br />Watch this DVD , because this film is now part of the romantic cult eighties movies.<br />A winner.
B00000AFWW|4.0|THIS ALBUM, WHICH IS THE LAST ALBUM THAT HOLE WOULD DO TOGETHER, IS A GREAT ALBUM. 4 YEARS AFTER KURT COBAIN'S DEATH, COURTNEY LOVE RETURNS WITH HER HOLE BANDMATES WITH THIS COOL CD. THERE REALLY ISN'T ANY BAD SONGS ON THIS CD. THE BEST TRACKS WERE ''PLAYING YOUR SONG'', ''MALIBU'', ''AWFUL'', AND ''DYING''. UNFORTUNATELY, COURTNEY LOVE ANNOUNCED HOLE'S OFFICIAL BREAKUP IN 2002. COURTNEY LOVE HAS SINCE GONE SOLO. BUT, I SERIOUSLY DON'T THINK COURTNEY LOVE'S CD WILL EVEN COMPARE TO THE LAST 2 CDS THAT SHE DID WITH HOLE. MAYBE IF WE'RE LUCKY, HOLE MIGHT REUNITE ONE DAY.
0671027344|5.0|This haunting novel is about the dilemma of passivity and growing up. The protagonist, Charlie, is entering a new world. He's entering high school for the first time and he learns about who he is to the rest of the world. Charlie is a wallflower. He's different from everyone else and he shares his feelings and thoughts to us through letters. This book is more intimate than a diary, though we don't know where Charlie lives, or who he's writing to. Charlie goes through uncharted territory, living his life and running from it all at the same time. It's a great coming-of-age story. It shows the hardships and trials of growing up in life, and competing to fit in. This novel demonstrates what it's like to grow up through a teenager's mind. Along with THE LOSERS' CLUB by Richard Perez, this is one of the best books I've read in ages.
B00020HEL6|5.0|If you like ultra cool piano bar jazz, you would want this album for the instrumentals alone, which I give 5 stars. Add in the final instrument, the voice of Renee Olstead (another 5 stars) and you have a perfect 10. The album starts out with an original and breathtaking rendition of Gershwin's Summertime and ends on a high note when Ms. Olstead takes you on a Sentimental Journey. In between are 10 more gorgeous tunes including Midnight at the Oasis, What a Difference a Day Makes, and my favorite (heck, they are all my favorites), Is You or Is You Not My Baby. <br />I listened to Summertime on Ms. Olsteads' website after a friend recommended her to me. That was enough to convince me that she is one tremendous talent. I bought her CD the same day. I didn't just plop in my CD player and continue with business as usual. Instead, for the first listening I got comfortable, tuned out the rest of the world, and tuned into Renee's amazing talent. I suggest you do the same. Then you will fully appreciate her gift from the Gods. By giving her your full attention you will discover so many little nuances as she employs a 101 techniques in delivering a masterful performance on every song.<br />In reading the liner notes I discovered a very likeable young lady who is so thankful for the many people in her life who made this CD possible. It was nice to see such maturity in someone so young. Knowing she's a fine person makes the CD just that much better. Why she even thanked me at the end for reading the notes!<br />I just had a dream:  I walked into the coolest New York piano bar and there was Renee and her combo getting ready for an evening of music making. I settled in, ordered a Gran Marnier, and prepared for a voyage to heaven. I don't expect be so lucky anytime soon, but I have the next best thing, her CD. I couldn't recommend it any higher. You will simply love it!!!<br />Phil Capelle

Even the songs that I never originally favored in Hybrid Theory, this album turned them around.

6304698526|4.0|1968's Bullitt is best known for its classic car chase scene that is still considered by many to the best of all time. The movie is worth watching for that scene alone as Steve McQueen's fastback Mustang chases down a Dodge Charger for a tense ten minutes through the streets of San Francisco.  Even without that memorable scene, Bullitt is a classic 60's film.  Mr. McQueen's performance as steely police detective Frank Bullitt is one of his best and the forerunner of the anti-heroes that would dominate films of the 70's.  The plot revolves around a seemingly routine job for Bullitt and his men to protect a mob informant (Pat Renella) who is set to testify before a Senate subcommittee.  When two hitmen break into the safe house and fatally wound the informant and injury another detective, Bullitt begins to have questions and takes up investigating the case on his own with the help of fellow detective Delgetti (Don Gordon).  Fighting them at every turn is ruthless and ambitious senator Chalmers played with unctuous smarm by Robert Vaughan.  Jacqueline Bissett co-stars in one of her first roles as Bullitt's girlfriend and Robert Duvall has a bit part as a cabbie.  Director Peter Yates crafts a gritty look to the film and editor Frank Keller won the Academy Award for his superb work.
055357342X|5.0|The Song Of Ice and Fire series has been the best one of it's genre I've ever read (bar the sword of truth series maybe). A storm of swords, parts one and two, compliment the first two superbly and I can't wait for the fourth to be released.
B0000AZKPC|5.0|My introduction to Sonata Arctica came with the release of &quot;Winterhearts Guild.&quot; A fairly late one it was after their monumental albums &quot;Ecliptica&quot; and &quot;Silence.&quot; My friend let me borrow a burned copy of his, so I decided to buy their third album. &quot;Ecliptica&quot; is a heavier, and faster album than &quot;Winterhearts Guild&quot; but both are very good. The lyrical content of &quot;Ecliptica&quot; may be slightly better and may please Power Metal fans more. Overall, there is not one song on &quot;Ecliptica&quot; that I don't like. Sonata Arctica is an incredible band in the realm of Blind Guardian, Stratovarious, Nightwish and Rhapsody. Fans of Progressive Power Metal must check this one out. Simply put, this is the best debut CD of any Progressive Power Metal band. These young Finns don't mess around.
B000005HO0|3.0|Yup its live all right, warts and all: Hellhammer drops his sticks during Pagan Fears and is fairly sloppy throughout (he got MUCH better in subsequent years) The guitar is poorly recorded and mixed, etc..  It's a shame Dead blew his stupid brains out and didn't do any more work with Mayhem 'cause he's the best vocalist they ever had.  He made precious few recordings and his story is now just another cautionary tale about depressed children playing with guns, ah well.<br /><br />The show has a very good (cold, dark and frightening) atmosphere about it and thats why its worth getting.  But the sound quality is atrocious and only hints at the power of Mayhem in front of an audience, so \\"Leipzig\\" only gets 3 stars.  The band in no way shape or form sounded like this live (I'd love to have been at this show).  All we're left with is this extremely flawed document thats of more interest from an  historical perspective than as an album: you get to hear Dead in a live setting near the beginning of Mayhems' career.  But as another reviewer has said I'm afraid that had he not killed himself (and had Varg not killed Euronymous), very few people would pay attention to this badly recorded (its so necro its decomposed), sloppy show.
6305922756|3.0|I'm not giving this film 3 stars as a comedy but actually as a serious film. What??? Well, here's the thing: I watched &quot;This is Spinal Tap&quot; in 2004. For whatever reasons i hadn't seen it up until this point, but i can't help it that it seemed dated to me.<br />    More than probably, back in 1984 when it was released, this thing cut it. It cut it with the frequency of humor it had and with the story it presents. But today? Today, it simply seems dated and even from a historical point of view there could've been a much better result to have come out of it, especially if another (more interesting) band was featured. It's not like there weren't any choices out there, geeez, this is the rock world we're talking about. Motorhead, for one band, would've easily incorporated many of the &quot;assets&quot; of Spinal Tap as well as other added ones that would've made the overall product much more attractive and poignant.<br />    But having said that, Spinal Tap does have its worth and this is where i come to my point: I personally laughed wholeheartedly with only a few scenes in this film, mainly because to me this was hardly a comedy. Now, this is indeed scary, but why would i laugh with something supposedly made to mock when even big bands (no need to mention names) have been 50 times funnier as Tap? Or when i constantly read to this very day daily quotes from the rock gods that make you first re-read the quote with amazement and then burst with laughter realising it's seriously said. Did i say &quot;serious&quot;? That's exactly it. This film attempts to make something look funny when it's already hilarious to begin with. It tries too much, and often during the film i thought that stretching it was totally un-needed and spoiled the effort.<br />   I read the official review from Amazon and at the very end of it, it says that this is the best rocumentary ever made. I take up a  serious issue with that assessment folks: Unless one has not seen &quot;Almost famous&quot; (came out 4 years ago) would that statement hold sadly true. But Almost Famous is leagues better than Spinal Tap, it's far more poignant, far more accurate, far funnier, far deeper (ok, that wouldn't be too difficult) and it far more captures the times it portrays than Spinal Tap could ever hope to.<br />    I think that Spinal Tap is still watchable exactly because we know this is real (well, some of us do). Bands like that did exist in much worse form even, and -that's even scarier- they still do today (again, no need to mention names, those with even half a brain know the culprits). If someone wanted to find another Spinal Tap-like band to make a film about today he wouldn't have the slightest problem. Not back then, not now, not in 20 years from now, as pathetic as that sounds for the rock scene. Or for any musical scene for that matter.<br />    As a movie, &quot;Spinal Tap&quot; does well picking on all the rock cliches and their inane shallowness, it does even better representing the average rock farsical god, but it does so without keeping you interested enough, especially if you're not a rock afficionado and you dont &quot;see&quot; the references.<br />     The humor and the punchlines quickly become not so much repetitive but definately predictable, the horrible Tap songs are simply too horrifying to endure, you end up being thankful the 80s are gone and buried, and yet those with a deep knowledge of the scene are left thinking that this is only the tip of the iceberg and that the rest is left untouched in the film.<br />     All in all, the Tap movie does have its place in musical history (exactly where that place is, I'm not so sure). However, when it comes to films about the surreality of the rock scene things are pretty bleak: there are simply not many films, with the exception of 3-4, that capture that in an adequate way. All i can suggest for the time being is to opt instead for &quot;Almost Famous&quot;. Encyclopaedically speaking though, &quot;This is Spinal Tap&quot; does have its merits...
B0001NBMBC|5.0|As a musician I can say its great to see a band evolve as much as Slipknot has over the years. When they first arived I was one of the few who sided with Mudvayne over Slipknot. Today though, while I still love Mudvayne, I must tip my hat and give credit where it is due. Slipknot are there own machine (a monster of a machine at that) and this album is symbolic of everything the bands done. Its their trophy on the mantle. And for those of you whining that this album doesn't sound like Iowa: Go listen to Iowa! They already made that album. I don't won't to pay money for an album that sounds like one I already have!
B00004SV6S|2.0|Aside from Wickerman, this is not a good album.  In fact, it's boring.  We've heard all these old tricks and melodies before, only in more creative ways.  The production on this album is also horrible.  I almost thought it was recorded in mono.  The people giving it 4 or 5 stars are probably old, tired durds desparate for Maiden (and therefore them) to relive their glory
0156027321|5.0|This is a great survival story. Pi, moving from India to Canada, encounters a shipwreck, and he is stranded adrift with four animals. It is truly a bizarre epic of survival and faith. What makes this story so different from others is that it has such a more complex, full story than other modern books. Necessary for any book buff.
0446310786|4.0|In this book to kill a mockingbird by Harper Lee is a very good book. It is very good literature that all students should read. It symbolizes racism and to kill a mockingbird is a sin. A mockingbird is a bird that does nothing wrong. It sings nice songs to people to enjoy. It doesnt eat your garden or anything bad it is just a bird that is for your enjoyment.<br />    In this book Tom Robinson is a black man who is accused of raping a nineteen year old girl Mayella Ewell. This book is told by Jean Louise Finch A.K.A Scout. Her brother Jem and friend Dill run around together in the summer and try to get Boo Radley out of his house. Atticus is her dad and he is defending Tom Robinson.<br />    There are two parts of this book. In the first part the auther explains the different characters, what they do and how they act. It gives you some backgroung about the boo kand it helped me a lot. I like how she did it because when the book started getting good i could follow along very easily. This book doesnt start getting good until the end but it is like when you read it you keep wanting to so you can find out what happens next.<br />    I think this book is very good because it tells you a lot and the auther did a good job writing it. It was easy to follow along so it was more fun to read. I would recommend it to any buddy to read but more for the people that like history because it takes place in the 30's and it tells you what is going on then. I think it is a very good book.(But the movie isnt very good.)
B00005OMTT|5.0|With over a decade of music behind them, it was time for Enigma to put out a greatest hits retrospective. &quot;Love, Sensuality, Devotion: The Greatest Hits&quot;---or &quot;LSD&quot; for short---covers the first four albums from 1990 to 2000 by this brilliant, ambient studio group fronted by Michael Cretu. It's a terrific collection, with many classic Enigma tracks that seamlessly blend into one another for over 76 minutes of continuous, breathtaking music. Naturally, Enigma's two big hit singles, &quot;Sadeness Part 1&quot; and &quot;Return To Innocence&quot; are included, plus other Enigma favorites like &quot;Mea Culpa,&quot; &quot;Push The Limits,&quot; &quot;Gravity Of Love,&quot; &quot;Age Of Loneliness,&quot; &quot;Beyond The Invisible,&quot; and the thrilling &quot;I Love You...I'll Kill You.&quot; As an extra bonus, there are two new tracks: the brief intro &quot;The Landing,&quot; and the song &quot;Turn Around,&quot; an excellent tune featuring a more streamlined Enigma sound that points the way to the group's next album, 2003's &quot;Voyageur.&quot; And if that wasn't enough, a pair of tracks, &quot;TNT For The Brain&quot; and &quot;Principles Of Lust,&quot; have been slightly re-mixed for this collection, giving both songs a somewhat different but no-less-powerful feel. Even if you already own all of Enigma's studio albums, &quot;LSD&quot; is still worth picking up for (A) the pair of new tracks, (B) the pair of re-mixed songs, and (C) the generously long playing time of over 76 minutes. And, of course, &quot;LSD&quot; is a perfect introductory album for any newcomer to the wonderful music of Enigma who wants to hear a healthy sampling from the group's albums on a single disc. Either way, &quot;Love, Sensuality, Devotion&quot; is a must-buy Enigma album for your collection.
B00005YU1O|5.0|&quot;Waking Life&quot; is so full of ideas, one flowing to the next, it really does feel like some sort of lucid dream.  The animation adds to the overall vitality of the film.  It jumps off the screen, challenging the viewer to wrestle with these questions, to take responsibility for his/her existence for at least a couple of hours.  There is a sense of urgency bordering on desperation as the dream continues and the search for a center, for some kind of clear understanding begins to seem endless.<br />There is so much here to absorb, you can really loose yourself completely in the film.  At one point, we watch two men discussing the nature of film as an art form (I can't remember who they were) and then the perspective widens and we see that they are, themselves, on a movie screen in a theater with our main character as its sole occupant, which makes sense since it only exists in his mind - in his dream.  Of course, we are also in a theater watching the film, adding another level to this already multi-layered context.  <br />After seeing this movie, I felt thoroughly invigorated.  I wish there were more films like this.

B00003XB8K|5.0|For me, Enigma's fourth album, &quot;The Screen Behind The Mirror,&quot; released at the beginning of 2000, was the first GREAT album released in the New Millenium (okay, so the New Millenium really began in 2001, but why not cheat a little?). Once again, Enigma mastermind Michael Cretu turns in a glorious mix of ambient sounds, world music, opera samples, choir voices, slammin' beats, and keyboard-heavy progressive rock. &quot;The Screen Behind The Mirror&quot; is also a slight improvement over it's predecessor, the laid-back &quot;Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi&quot; (though I like that album just fine). This is a tougher-sounding Enigma, and the tunes definitely contain a lot of punch. Many brilliant tracks on this one, including &quot;Push The Limits,&quot; &quot;Gravity Of Love&quot; (featuring a very clever sample of Orff's &quot;Carmina Burana' and sung by Olive's Ruth-Ann), the powerful &quot;Modern Crusaders,&quot; the hypnotic title instrumental &amp; &quot;Endless Quest,&quot; and the memorable final song &quot;Silence Must Be Heard&quot; (with another great vocal by Ruth-Ann). Fabulous production &amp; sound, terrific instrumental work by Cretu &amp; guitarist Jens Gad, and strong vocals by Ruth-Ann, Andru Donalds and Cretu, and sultry guest vocals by Sandra Cretu and Elisabeth Houghton. Enigma's &quot;The Screen Behind The Mirror&quot; is another sparkling album from this brilliant studio group.
B0001WTUH6|4.0|When I first viewed &quot;Underworld&quot; I very much enjoyed it.<BR>It's been one of the most impressive Vampire and Werewolf movies to come out in recent years, and despite it's meager budget easily puts the more recently released &quot;Van Helsing&quot; to shame.<BR>But there were problems and I made full note of them.<br />Kate Beckinsale(Selene)'s performance is nearly withought flaw and almost carries the entire film, and along with being a talented actress she puts nearly ever other female action star to shame with how she handles herself.  Michael Sheen(Lucian) and Bill Nigh(Viktor) also make their characters very believable.  And the majority of the supporting cast is actually quite good, however, certain actors like Shane Brolly(Kraven) and Scott Speedman(Michael Corvin) delivered less than satisfactory performances.  Brolly, do to the fact that he didn't play an extremely large part isn't such an annoyance, or rather he's a good anoyance since he plays the jerk off you love to hate.  So he could be overlooked.  Speedman However was one of the flaws which I maleciously attacked during my first review.<br />Although this movie is certainly action packed, with a dark and gothic setting, it also has the undertones of a love story.  But in the original release I just couldn't see any real chemistry between Selene and Michael.  As much as I tried I just couldn't see any reason why Selene, a warrior with a vendetta against the entire werewolf race, would fall for him!  But in this Extended Cut all that is different.  Speedman's best scene was completely cut from the film.  In it he gives his back story and for the first time I actually started to like his character, and more importantly I actually found myself understanding their relationship!  Trust me, if you were a critic of the love plot like I was this is for you.<br />It still doesn't get five stars because I still didn't like how it ended.  I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it, but the film really just looses it's focus in the last fifteen minutes or so.  It's still a definate buy though and I'm eagerly awaiting the sequal.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|(...).

B0001ZX0PG|5.0|I guess the myth is true: Clint Eastwood makes 1 spectacular film in every 5 he directs (the last being UNFORGIVEN). Mystic River is a powerful story about deception, trust and guilt. We are introduced to three characters (Penn, Robbins, Bacon) who share a past they refuse to endure. They are somehow forced to reconcile after the daughter of Jimmy Markum (Penn)is found dead. Sean (Bacon) is a full-fledged police officer who is assigned to his case and struggles between being a domestic relationships and his professional obligations. Dave (Robbins) a victim of abuse, is then linked to this tragic murder and seeks to clear himself from suspicion from his own wife (Marcia Gay Harden). The film reaches its climax when assumptions get the better of facts, and we (the audience) are put on the spot and torn by doing what is right or what is necessary. On the surface it appears to be a who-dun-it crime investigation, but really what anchors this film is the emotional attachment the characters uphold. Truly a fantastic effort! If not for LOTR (which i didnt fancy), Mystic River would've swept the Oscars.
B00005NOOH|5.0|This is by far the best world war 2 documentary i have ever seen.  Running in at over 26hours with an additional 8hours of bounus features on the dvd, The World at War is one of the best documents of all time telling the story of this crucial time in world history.  I highly recommend this set to anyone interested in world war 2 and history.
B0000ACY0Y|5.0|This is Clark at his best.....a must have.
0345350499|5.0|This is a classic.  <br />One of the earliest fantasy books I read, it has become something I compare most fantasy to.  Even if you've read Arthurian legends before, you need to read this take on &quot;history&quot;.  Magic is portrayed in a way that makes it seem almost real; the characters are so vividly written that they are like old friends... or foes.  You will never see the story of Arthur in the same light after this book.  A MUST read for any fantasy fan, or anyone looking for a good historically based read that you can't put down.
B00009NHC5|5.0|Few actresses have lit up the screen in the same fashion as the late Audrey Hepburn.  In this 1967 thriller (her last Oscar nomination), she plays a blind woman who finds herself terrorized by a trio of men looking for a heroin-stuffed doll.<br />Relying on pure psychological suspense as opposed to gore and violence, WAIT UNTIL DARK is still a powerful movie.  Miss Hepburn is perfect for the role---she seems so frail, and yet there is an inner strength that comes to her aid in the final moments of the film.  She lost the Oscar that year to another Hepburn (Katherine in &quot;Guess Who's Coming to Dinner&quot;), and it just goes to show how Oscar at times relies more on sentimentality than the actual power of a performance.<br />Richard Crenna eschewed his good guy roles by playing Mike Talman, one of the cons who does appreciate Suzie's intelligence.  Jack Weston, a great comic actor, also goes for more visceral drama, and his performance as the buffoon is right on target.  And what about Mr. Alan Arkin?  His cold, insensitive evil is just right!!!  Little Julie Herrod as Gloria also does a credible job.<br />Terence Young's direction is tight and Henry Mancini's impeccable music also heightens the suspense.<br />WAIT UNTIL DARK is a classic thriller, and one of Miss Hepburn's finest moments.

1891252089|5.0|I just wanted to add my own 5 stars to the line up.  This is the yoga book I can't live without...if someone borrows it I get all edgy until it's returned. The scenic photos are stunning but the easy-to-use layout for my own practice is invaluable.<br />I too, recommend practice with a live class but once you know what you're doing this book will take you a long way. It's a gift to the yoga community and just fun to look at if you like to be amazed at what the human body can do.<br />I would love to see the other two series' layed out like this--just for fun.  I'm personally a primary series girl all the way, but still, I'm curious.
0375751513|5.0|Oscar Wilde's only novel is one of the best books I have ever read. The story is fascinating, and one that most people have heard of--that Dorian Gray, a young, beautiful man, makes a fervent wish that he would never grow old, and that the portrait just painted by his artist friend would age instead. This occurs, leading Dorian down a path of debauchery and cruelty, most of which must have been too horrific for Oscar Wilde to go into detail without violating obscenity laws.<br />The book is a masterpiece in examining manipulation. The artist introduces Dorian to a friend, Lord Henry, who calls Dorian's attention to his beauty, and Dorian, formerly innocent and sweet, becomes vain. It is amazing to see just how potent the power of suggestion is, and this novel demonstrates it perfectly.<br />The writing is less than perfect. One chapter goes on and on about artifacts that Dorian has collected around the world, leaving the reader saying, &quot;Okay, and who cares?&quot; Wilde's prose is far from flawless, but the story is so engaging that the reader will be willing to overlook the imperfections and will be intrigued in spite of this.
B0002A2WDQ|4.0|Why is it taking soooo long for this to be released on DVD!<br />Just take a stroll through the web to see the number of people waiting for this release!<br />This has got to be in my top 10 of favourite films. My VHS copy has worn out.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Yah right, what are you people listening too? She doesn't have anything in common with Aerosmith, so stop comparing already. I'm Canadian, &amp; I've never heard of Rush, so no comment. This album is a hundred times better then Let Go. Let Go is an embarrassement to this. Much improvement Avril has made, she writes a lot her songs with hardly any help, she's playing guitar live now, which is awesome, before she only played for like 3 songs(Tomorrow, Naked &amp; Things I'll Never Say). Now, she's playing guitar live for almost all her songs, if not all. I saw her perform at Much last Friday, on TV that is, every new song she performed, 8 songs it was, she played guitar for except Forgotten &amp; Slipping Away she played piano. She's far more talented now, &amp; I don't know how anyone can not like this album unless you absolutely despised Avril in the 1st place, but then what's the point of listening to this then if you know you're already going to hate it. Well, here's a quick review:<br /> Take Me Away: 5/5 This song is awesome, the chorus rocks, &amp; verses are amazing.<br /> Together: 4.5/5 If you actually listen to it, the lyrics are very meaningful, the pre-chorus is my favourite part. I'm using this song for my Poetry Project in English, which is kinda cool!!<br /> Don't Tell Me: 4.5/5 Who can't love her first single? Unless you hear it so often you get sick of it. Well, I was close, until I decided to stop listening to it for a while, &amp; hey, that works. I still really love it!! Fun song<br /> He Wasn't: 5/5 Speaking of fun songs, this is definitely one of them. I love the guitar, the chorus, everything about it!!<br /> How Does It Feel: 5/5 An cool slow song, which you don't get too often. I love this song, it's so innovative &amp; emotional. I didn't cry or anything, but it's sad &amp; cool.<br /> My Happy Ending: 4.5/5 Fun, fun, fun!~!<br /> Nobody's Home: 5/5 Very thoughtful song, this is the one I was going to use for my Poetry assignment but changedmy mind at the last second, I love this song! Terrific.<br /> Forgotten: 5/5 Now this is punk!! Simply fantastic.<br /> Who Knows: 4.5/5 Outstanding!! I love it. Tells you to be  happy about life &amp; don't be afraid to take chances, something alot of people need as a confidence booster.<br /> Fall to Pieces: 4/5 I like this song, it's catchy, &amp; meaningful, only a little too personal for my likings but awesome just the same, great!!<br /> Freak Out: 5/5 NOw this is the Avril we all know &amp; love, it's time to just rock out!!<br /> Slipping Away: 5/5 But not too this song, slowest song on the album, but it is pretty!!<br /> Note: She wrote Fall to Pieces with Raine Maida(Our Lady Peace) &amp; Together/He Wasn't/How Does It Feel/Forgotten/Who Knows/Slipped Away with Chantal Kreviazuk. Also includes a free mini poster with 2 sides, ones the cover, &amp; ones just another picture of her. Very pretty!!<br /> Overall, terrific album, I look forward to hearing more of her. Somethings telling me this girl is sticking around for a while!!
0375508414|5.0|This book is about life in the early 1900s and life in the 80s. It's bout how no matter when you are alive you have to deal with the same types of situations. This story stays true to the south. The relationship between Idgie and Ruth is so inspiring. I would recommend this book to anybody who enjoys a good laugh and a good cry. I personally enjoyed this book because it gives you a lot of life's lessons in a small book.
B0001US8EO|5.0|This 2-disc Special Edition DVD has some of the best features that I have ever seen on a DVD.  This is most fitting given the fact that this is one of the very best Westerns that I have ever seen.  The performances are excellent as are the direction and script.  Best of all, unlike most movies about western legends like Wyatt Earp, this movie was made with a strict reliance on historical fact as it really is  and not some tall tale.  This is important because the likes of Wyatt Earp did all they can to create a mythology about how brave and noble they were to cover up for the fact that the real life Earp and friends were not all that much different from the bad guys that they fought against.
B0001V07ZQ|5.0|This movie was good and deserves a 4.5 but there are on 4 and 5 so I have to give it 5 (to counteract the bad reviews given by that Londoner)  Otherwise I would give it a 4 becaue I saw it on my TV instead of in the theatre and the movie should really be seen in a theatre.  I thought it was going to be a stupid blockbuster but It was really a entertaining well rounded film that I will recommend.  (im pretty picky aout my movies)-snobby if you will.
B000059H99|5.0|I'm not going to bore you with the storyline details , because honestly....there's noone who hasn't seen a Rocky film. However , if for some unknown ,and unforgivable reason , you haven't seen the first installment, of the Rocky series , then I highly recommend that you see this one. Whether you're into great acting , interesting characters , love stories , or just a plain old a.. whupp'in film , this is your class A ticket to ride. People have said that Rocky's sequels don't measure up to the first one , and I think it depends on your prospective. I will say, that the first one ( Rocky ), wasn't written for a sequel. Sylvester Stallone , got inspired to write a story and he took his time , writing it. Therefore , the story line and charater building was one of the script's, most important aspects and it created a buildup to the eventual fight , that's unforgettable and you'll find yourself holding onto the edge of your seat and swinging your fists in the air. This particuliar dvd version is extra special because it takes you through , scene by scene , with  commentary from the original cast. Even old sly did a special , opening presentation. This is not only one of the best boxing films of all time , it's one of the best films of all time. If you liked any of the Rocky films , you'll love this one. Great acting , great script , great direction , great cinematography , great action choreography , great editing , and an unforgetable musical score will make you believe that this underdog and south paw , can really &quot;do it&quot; !!
B000002J09|2.0|While i was exposed to a good deal of music from the 60s and 70s while growing up, i was fortunate enough to have never been drawn into Led Zepplin.  While the album as a whole sounds alright, i cannot give it anything othr than a 2 because of the blatant plagerism in \\"Stairway to Heaven\\".  I know how acusing one of the \\"biggest\\" songs of all time of plagerism may seem un-just, however i must inform the reader of some key facts.  In the late 60s and early 70s there was an rock band by the name of Spirit; included on their self titled debut of 67 is an instrumental track called \\"Taurus\\".  The main guitar line from \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" was lifted straight from \\"Taurus\\".  One might also find it interesting that early in Led Zepplins career they opened for Spirit, and after that they were known to include the Spirit song \\"Fresh Garbage\\" in there live set.  Obviously Led Zepplin gained a great deal by paying close attention to Spirit, i urge you to pay some attention to Spirit as well.  If you are new to Led Zepplin i highly suggest you instead invest your money in inovative and talented bands such as Spirit or the James Gang, as Zepplin'a fame is more a product of plagerism, and the \\"mass consumption of cheese metal phenominia\\" that has occured throughout the past 30 years.
0061015725|1.0|Mildly entertaining rubbish, about a group of nanotechnicians locked in a lab in the Nevada desert, and the scary things that can happen if we get carried away with science, and ourselves. <BR> I got about half way through the story, and ABSOLUTELY NOTHING HAPPENED!!! I don't often tear up a book, and throw it in the trash can, but I with this horrible excuse for a thriller! <BR> Everyone knows that science, with no moral boundaries is likely to go haywire, and undo the good it was intended for, so why bother reitterating the obvious! <BR> ABSOLUTE CLAPTRAP, AND NOT WORTH THE TIME, OR MONEY IT TAKES TO GET IT, AND READ IT! <BR>Pick up, and read Timeline, instead, a much better book by Crichton!
B0001UL7RY|5.0|First of all: I and probably everyone else who has written a negative review of this doesn't hate all things popular. Even music. I listen to Zep, Floyd, APC, Tool, and basically whatever the hell I want to. Nobodies telling me what to listen to, least of all myself. I can listen to metal, rock, I've even got some Clapton CD's. The fact is, I appreciate music, and listen to many different genres. The fact is, Avril sucks. She would suck no matter what genre she played in. She could even attempt to play f*cking metal, and she would still suck. She is manufactured. If she didn't have 50 people helping her produce every meaningless album she would never, ever make it in the music buisiness. And whats this about Slayer being a boy band with guitars? obviously you have never listened to them. Moron.
B00009V7P8|5.0|I've tried to put down my thoughts here for some time. Damien's music has the ability to burrow into your soul. He doesn't really do anything new, yet you can't really point to another performer who does what he accomplished on this album. Its emotional, raw, open, lyrical, in some ways almost naive. Nothing cynical here, which may be why some reviewers have trouble with a song like Cannonball. <br />But there is extraordinary skill in this record. I think the occassional flat note is purposeful. The rise and fall in Damien's vocals, the warmth of Vivienne's cello, the truly heavenly gift of Lisa Hannigan's vocals, and Damien's guitar through all of it. After nearly a year, &quot;Eskimo&quot; still gives me chills (operatic vocals in Norwegian!). &quot;Older Chests&quot; still draws a tear (listen for the kids playing). The four vocal lines in &quot;Volcano&quot; are thematically fascinating. <br />This is a gift. And the amazing this is his live shows are nothing short of a revelation.<br />Fall in love, break your heart, and console yourself along with Mr. Rice and company.
B000268QB2|3.0|If you need an album to mellow out to, something to just kick back and flow with, this is the one. Although I usually prefer music with Electric Guitars and harder melody, Keane captivated me with their lyrical delivery and killer vocals. Get it today...
B00005JLSE|2.0|Chicago was just ok.  I rented this movie last week and thought that I would be blowed away due to all the hype about this movie.  Well, there were a few cute numbers with Catherine Zeta-Jones and Renee Zellweger, that's about it.  The characters were not developed and the story was so simple that it was almost boring.  Rent or buy Moulin Rouge if you want to see a great, moving musical.
B00005JMEW|3.0|not really good, but not bad either...  it's worth a watch, if you're really bored, but not much else.
B00000JLWW|5.0|this is one of the best movies ever made...wait to get the TITANIC: extreme SPECIAL EDITION in late to mid- 2004 before buying this DVD! Titanic is awsome.
0434413011|4.0|To Kill A Mocking Bird<br /> To Kill A Mocking Bird the books author is Harper Lee.  The genre of      To Kill A Mocking Bird  is historical fiction.  The style of the book is set in the south in the 1930?s and the author uses all the slang that was being used during this time period.  As the reader, you experience the1930?s through one of the main characters, Scout.  The setting of the book is a small town in Alabama.  The book gives the reader an idea of what small town life was like when a controversial event occurs.  The courtroom scenes in the book take the reader through the climax of the story.   During this portion of the story, you start to understand the whole book , all of the characters and their roles. <br />The main characters of the book are Scout, Jem, Atticus, Dill, Calpurnia and Aunt Alexandria.  Jem and Scout meet Dill early on in the book, they work together to get Boo Radley out of the house.  Scout starts school and she gets into a fight with some of the boys because her father Atticus is involved in a big case, he is defending a black man.  Atticus was called to an emergency board meeting to make budget cuts.  Jem and Scout went with Calpurnia to her church and when they came back, their Aunt Alexandria was on their doorstep.  <BR>Their aunt brings a lot of change into the lives of Jem and Scout.  During this summer, Jem and Dill started to exclude Scout form their presence. Scout spends more time with Miss. Maudie.  One day Jem, Dill, and Scout decide to go and try to peak in the Radely house.  Jem and Scout get into more trouble when Miss. Dobuse starts to talk about their father. <BR>I think the author did a great job with making the story interesting by foreshadowing.  Like when Atticus says it is a sin to kill a mockingbird.  I would recommend this to others because there is a lot to be learned from this book.  I think that more mature people would like this book because of the content of the book.
B000002IPZ|5.0|overated????!!!!!...why dont you overate my ass!!.This is one of the greatest testament albums of all time!!. even though i still think the new order is there best album. this is so heavy great drumming,chuck billys best vocal performance so far,guitar sound like a bit like metallica but the riffs are awesome. highlights are:face in the sky,falling fast,souls of black,love to hate,one man's fate,the legacy,and the seven days of may.I never skip a track in this album this is simply put as a thrash metal classic.so if you like testament or any other thrash band you should get this!!!.
0743243315|4.0|Monica Ali's &quot;Brick Lane&quot; doesn't in my opinion merit the overflow of critical accolades heaped upon it. It isn't even a particularly outstanding novel about immigrant lives in the land of milk and honey. I've certainly read better. <br />To begin with, the book is over 400 pages long and grossly overwritten. The plot is gruel thin - there's no narrative momentum to speak of, the story goes nowhere - and the prose is for the most part curiously flat. While it's a huge relief to know that not all young novelists feel the need to write in the manic style so favoured by contemporary writers of today, Ali's writing simply lacks spark. She makes the further mistake of making Hasina write to Nazneen in laboured broken English. I developed a headache reading it. It would help if I half understood it.<br />Thematically, it's also too conservative. Ali doesn't stretch out far enough. Sure, you experience the intergenerational conflict of immigrant families, wonder at the irony of Chanu's romantic homebound longings and so on but isn't it incredible that we don't get to meet a single white person in a story about life in England ?      <br />Ali succeeds best with her characterisation. Nazneen is a picture  of docility, accepting whatever Fate doles out to her...until Karim the young local-born firebrand walks into her life. Chanu is a lovable buffoon - pure bathos - but one that wins our sympathy  -  he is as much a victim of traditional values as Nazneen. Mrs Islam, a bloodsucker masquerading as friend and Razia, Nazneen's one true friend and source of her deliverance are full bodied and wonderfully sketched characters.  But why does Karim seem so underdeveloped and skeletal in contrast ? Maybe Ali didn't bother because he's only the catalyst for Nazneen's transformation, nothing more. In any case, Nazneen's affair with Karim is perhaps the least convincing aspect of the story. It has a false note about it and for that reason, I never bought it.<br />&quot;Brick Lane&quot; isn't a bad novel. It has its moments but these don't justify the huge praise lavished on it. It is in my opinion possibly the least worthy candidate for last year's Man Booker Prize. Disappointing.
B00008YLV2|5.0|This movie is probably the most realistic film to date on war. Amazingly descriptive and hauntingly tragic it stays with you for days.<br />Ridley Scott has made a phenomenal film depicting the true events of the American involvement in Somalia which lead to the downing of a Black Hawk helicopter. The opening images of Mogadishu give the impression of hell on earth. Emaciated Somalis walk about the desert with no hope, the dead are piled up and forgotten, nothing exists to base a life upon. Scott develops two ideas from these tragic opening scenes, one the heart-wrenching sorrow of the Somalian people and two of the necessity for American troop involvement. Scott has recreated Mogadishu as perfectly as Hollywood is capable of doing. You feel the heat and dirt clinging to your skin; you smell the burning weapons and dying flesh. He has accomplished an amazing feat without sacrificing the humanness of the situation.<br />The Somalian people are portrayed as wild representations of human beings. They are bold and brave while at the same time being people of tremendous calculation and cooperation. Their markets are aisles of weapons and entire towns are prepared to fight and kill without question. The warlords are heartless choosing to control the population by starvation, drugs and death. Families are ripped apart, children become murdering soldiers, and thousands of people become living skeletons before they die. The soldiers are prepped with Quat, a cocaine like substance, and they soon become absolute killing machines with no mercy. Everyone is armed with AK47's and the decimated streets become killing fields. Nothing is sacred except the call to prayer, the Mosques being the only buildings that remain intact. It is unfathomable to imagine how someone survives under such circumstances. <br />The American soldiers are portrayed by convincing actors like, Tom Sizemore, Josh Hartnett, Ewan McGregor, Sam Shepard and most especially Eric Bana. They bond as a unit throwninto a war and used as pawns by Washington. They are noble, brave and proudly willing to fight a mission they soon lose control of. The people in charge of the mission misguide and misdirect one too many times losing touch with the violence that the soldiers face while on the ground in Mogadishu. The scenes depict the absolute chaos that takes over the well planned and sophisticated mission to capture the Somalian warlord, Aidid. It shows how war on paper and on video games is much different from reality. This film violently brings to life the horror of war. Bodies are blown apart, torsos severed in half, soldiers left behind to die and no answers in sight. Scott does a fantastic job of showing the pride of American patriotism while also convincing us of the suffering that the Somalian people have lived with.<br />Unfortunately this film would have to be several hours longer to include all the background for the violence exhibited against the American soldiers. Watch documentaries and read books to get the full story behind \\"Black Hawk Down\\". Although it is horribly tragic to lose the lives of American soldiers, especially to have their bodies dragged and mutilated, it is also tragic to lose thousands of lives on the other side. This film will hit you with such force and open your eyes to the horrors of war. It takes hatred, rage and revenge to another level. It brings to the forefront how our world has changed; no longer can powerful sophisticated armies override poor countries as a granted privilege. Although you will scream with patriotism while watching this film you will also realize that humans are humans and blood flows the same regardless of who it comes from.  I will be forever convinced that there must be a better way.
B000002GW5|5.0|When this album came out in 1977 I was a roadie on tour with another artist.  We heard this record when we came home on a short break a few weeks after it was released and I couldn't believe it...an album that commemorated life on the road.  Although &quot;Running on Empty&quot; has been played to death it still holds up as a great rock anthem.  The best song on the CD is definitely &quot;Rosie&quot; which captures the true essence of the roadie life (losing the girl to the drummer).  The sleeper track is &quot;The Road&quot; a melancholy reflection on the horrible loneliness that is prevalent on the road.  Finally the song &quot;Cocaine&quot; hits WAY to close to home for those of us that were seduced by its charms back then.  Running on Empty is a must have CD for anyone that experienced the concert scene in the 70's (or wishes they could have).  I give this CD 5 stars (attached with gaffer's tape)
B00005QGAX|5.0|Every time I read a professional review of Michael Jackson's Bad, I find that EVERY article compares it to Thriller!  Why?  Thriller cannot be beaten, even by its own creator!  Don't compare the two! Bad in itself is a masterpiece, and DID have much success, with over 25 million copies sold worldwide! <BR>What Thriller has for the entire album, Bad has for each song! Highlights:<br />Bad-A magnificent song to open the album.  Guaranteed to make you want to dance!<br />The Way You Make Me Feel-Next to Beat It, probably Michael's most well known song.  Has an excellent pulse and drive to it. Again, you WILL want to move!<br />Liberian Girl-An often overlooked and underated MJ ballad. Smooth music and vocals!<br />Another Part Of Me-Taken from Michael's Captain EO movie. Good song, but the extended version (on the single) is better, as well as Michael's live version in the music video.<br />Man In The Mirror-Definitely a sing along song! Enjoy the emotional and powerful vocals!<br />I Just Can't Stop Loving You-A truly beautiful and moving duet between Michael and Siedah Garrett. Would make an excellent wedding song!<br />Dirty Diana-One of my favorites! Powerful vocals. Rockin' guitar solo. MJ rocks out!<br />Smooth Criminal-Alien Ant Farm revived this song, but did it little justice.  MJ's original is better because he uses darker bass sounds, thumping beats, and powerful vocals.  No question; you WILL dance!  MY FAVORITE!!<br />On this special release, Michael includes three &quot;new tracks&quot;: the Spanish version of &quot;I Just Can't Stop...&quot; , &quot;Streetwalker&quot;, and &quot;Fly Away&quot;.  I don't see why these songs were cut from Bad; they could have easily replaced the non-standout tracks, like &quot;Speed Demon&quot; and &quot;Just Good Friends&quot;.  Also be sure to check out the exclusive Quincy Jones interview.<br />Don't hold back buying this album because it's &quot;not as good&quot; as Thriller-it is a WONDERFUL WONDERFUL piece of work!
0743454529|3.0|I had never heard of Jodi Picoult before reading this book. The reason I picked it up was becuase I was intrigued with the premise of the story and I got into it within the first chapter. The characters were engaging and found myself wanting to know what would happen next.<br />Although I enjoyed the book enough to read it in one day, I felt that at times it strayed too far from the family's dynamic (i.e. the lawyer, the GAD, and their histories - who cares?)making me question where the author was going. For me the big disappointment was the ending - it just seemed too improbable and a little too pat, like she had to wrap the story up and hadn't fully thought through how she was going to do it. <br />However, having said that, I will still recommend this book to friends.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|don't waist your time, dont buy it. is the worst ever film movie!!
B00005JMUA|5.0|I enjoyed Kill Bill Vol 1, it was the first Tarantino film I saw and I was stunned. Yet for all its cinematic greatness, I thought it was missing something.<br />Vol 2 is what it was missing.<br />The difference between the two is like night and day (no gore in KB2); yet they complete each other in a way I cannot describe. KB2 focuses on the characters and gives us the much-needed stories behind the Bride and Bill, the characters we care most about going into the 2nd volume. The Bride's real name is finally revealed (yes, the bleeps were meant to be there) and we realize that we've been hearing her name all along (one of Tarantino's favorites: messing with the audience). Thurman's performance as the Bride will be the defining point of her career -- she is infinitely more human yet still the killing machine from KB1.<br />Other notable characters:<BR>~Michael Madsen as Budd -- great perfomance, wonderfully sadistic<BR>~Gordon Lui as Pei Mei -- hilarious new character, the Bride's martial arts trainer, who is introduced with an enticing backstory. Your jaw drops when he is introduced because he lives up to his initial description.<BR>~Darryl Hannah as Elle -- best villian in the film, she has great lines that are delivered with the utmost perfection. I esp like her devilishly entertaining exchange with Budd.<BR>~Michael Parks as Esteban -- Charming and interesting, he has great dialogue with the Bride.<BR>~David Carradine as Bill -- Phew, what to say here. Simply astonishing. I'm not sure whether to love him or hate him, a new dimension to Bill is revealed that shows his complexity. Carradine is perfect for the part; the way he brandishes a butcher knife for making a sandwhich and talks to the Bride makes me wonder where he's been all these years.<br />The dialogue is the highlight of KB2, but Tarantino's film techniques are breathtaking. The Bride's initial confrontation with Budd (with Budd staring into the cliffs as if expecting his attacker to pounce from the darkness) and later her dramatic escape attempt (which begins with a spine-tingling close up of a nail being hammered into a coffin, followed by an intense barrage of sound) reach the highest levels of suspense I have ever seen in a movie. The Bride's battle with Elle may be the best close-quarters fight scene ever to grace the screen, and the dramatic music and tremendous build up during the fight lead to its curveball ending, which has you simultaneously squirming and clamoring for more.<br />I highly encourage that KB1 is seen first... it makes KB2 more suspenseful by tenfold (because KB1 hints at what will happen in KB2) but it is not necessary to understand what's going on. If you thought KB1 was too gory or lacked a plot, KB2 is the remedy.<br />KB2 has something for everyone; action, suspense, comedy, romance (yup, not a typo), beautiful cinematography, tasty and *insightful* dialogue -- I just never wanted it to end.<br />Quite simply, films like the Kill Bills are the reason I go to the movies in the first place. After seeing these (which inspired me to see QT's other films) I will never look at another movie the same way again -- I don't know how to describe it, but Tarantino makes all other films seem unworthy to share the silver screen.
B00008NG5V|5.0|I was very skeptical when people kept telling me I needed to check out Jack Johnson's music.  Usually, I don't take it as a good sign when the masses flock to something, but good grief, this is a fantastic album.<br /><br />Lyrically, he touches on some serious themes like in &quot;Holes to Heaven&quot; and &quot;Cookie Jar.&quot;  However, it isn't preachy or anything, which is a big plus.  I also like the minimal instrumentation: acoustic guitar, bass and drums.  Nothing flashy or big and fancy.  It's like party music with substance.  Jack Johnson, while not sounding like Dave Matthews is what I kind of wish Dave Matthews was.  Low key instrumentation with some heady subject matter and then a bunch of good time songs.<br /><br />You can tell from the music that Johnson is someone that grew up around the ocean.  It's just so laid back and summertime feeling.  You can also hear traces of  Hawaiian music in his otherwise original style.<br /><br />I can't recommend this highly enough.
B00004XONN|5.0|Well, I was a pretty big Radiohead fan in highschool - Ok Computer was one of my favorite albums. I changed musical directions though and got into Dylan, Tom Waits, folk, jazz, and generally older stuff - so I unintentionally avoided current music for a large part of my college career, which has just ended.  A friend of mine who is a huge Radiohead fan urged me to give listen to this album - so it wasn't until 2004 that I experienced Kid A for the first time.  I tend to fall asleep with headphones on most nights, and usually it is Kid A with which I do so - the world it creates is simply stunning. I rushed back to listen to Ok Computer after hearing Kid A for the first time - - - it was still great, but the album that I thought would stand as Radioheads pinnacle achievement was pushed down a slot - Kid A is a startling piece of work.  I don't think since the Beatles or Dylan has a popular music group put out a product that was so commercialy popular or artistically challenging.  I've since aquired the rest of Radiohead's catalogue, and while their music is consistently interesting and enjoyable, Kid A is the album I am most inspired by.  After living with this album for many months in my headphones, it's still a fresh journey everynight.  Now when I hear critics or fans compare Coldplay to this group I feel a little sick and reviled inside - such a foolish comparison.  Anyway, Radiohead are an inspiration to me - I hope they continue to evolve and produce beautiful and challenging music.  True, it is not as sophisticated as a Mahler symphony - but for pop music - this is as awe-inspiring as it gets! Enjoy.
0553296981|5.0|I am so sorry that Anne didn't journal her days to your liking.  Yes, she was in hiding in an attic for two solid years, but really, the nerve of her boring you to death 60 years later.  I mean, the nerve of her!  Where was the mystery, the car crashes, the espionage love triangle?  When I was 13 I was SO much more articulate in my written words.  So, she was hiding for her life, we all have our sob stories.
B00000JPYQ|5.0|I bought this cd because UFO were a major influence on Iron Maiden.  I wasn't sure what I was going to get and was pleasently blown away!  These guys rock. It doesn't matter what style of rock'n'roll you like because these cats transcend all styles.  They are just pure, straight forward rockers.
B000002KOO|4.0|This is definitely the best album of the Green lineup of the band (and the last).  I own two differing vinyl versions of this album: one rarer version with a black sleeve (that I think was the original UK release), and this version (the USA version?). It's a pity that the other version isn't available on CD because it contains Danny Kirwan's haunting 'Without You' which I think is by far the best thing he ever did. This version includes 'Oh well' instead which as far as I remember never appeared on any UK proper studio album.<br />That complaint aside, this is truly a flawed masterpiece. The rather tacked together style of this album adds to its charm - two bits of an edited jam (named after Madge, an FM groupie) wedged between more fleshed out songs.  I think 'Before the beginning' is one of Green's best songs and the duelling between Kirwan and Green on the jams is awesome. By the way, Jeremy Spencer didn't even appear on this album, his tired Rock n' Roll impressions had worn thin at this point.  This leaves Kirwan more breathing space which is great at he was a far stronger writer/performer and he has been undervalued for too long.  It's sad to note that he is currently a homeless man in London, and has long since given up playing. That said, 'When you say' is pretty weak (though Christine McVie did a better version with Danny on guitar).<BR>All in all a great swansong from a fine collection of musicians - Just put 'Without You' back in there!

B00022LRXA|5.0|&quot;Before and After Science&quot; represented Eno in peak form. It's mixture of art-rock songs and ambient instrumental passages marked a turning point for him as well; this would be the last solo album where he would sing for more than a decade. &quot;No One Receiving&quot; with its funky, lumpy bass line and it's odd melody immediately captures your attention. &quot;King's Lead Hat&quot; (an anagram for Talking Heads) reflected Eno's hope that he would be selected (which he was) to produce the band's albums. In fact, you can hear echoes of Eno on the trio of Heads albums he produced. While there's no denying David Bryne and the band's genius, it's clear that Eno had a huge impact as a producer on helping the band expand on their original sound.<br />&quot;Spider and I&quot; closes the album with one of Eno's most gentle melodies. It sounds almost like a lullaby and the gentle music could easily lull you to sleep. It helped set the stage for Eno's next stage where he devoted himself full time to developing ambient projects.<br />The remastered sound using the DSD system comes through with the vibrance and warmth one would expect from the album. While the previous edition of the album sounded very good, there's better clarity and depth evident in the recording on this edition even when listened to on a cheap stereo system. My only disappointment is the lack of thought put into the packaging. There's no liner notes, no lyrics and while the cardboard digipak is housed in a nice plastic container, the presentation inside is bare bones. We get the album credits and no more. While that reflects the original issue of the album on vinyl, it wouldn't have hurt to expand the packaging (and include a bonus track or two).
B00000JGHM|3.0|This was easily the most disappointing film I've seen on DVD this year.  Not because it isn't well made--it is--but considering the filmmaking talent on both sides of the camera, I expected a lot more.  First the good.  Michael Mann.  This man rules when it comes to shooting shoot-outs, and the centerpiece bank robbery scene is magnificent AND realistic.  Now the bad.  Al Pacino.  One of Hollywood's all time best actors gives one of his all time worst performances in this film.  Al whips out the wood chipper to go to town on the scenery in this one.  Yes, he overacts THAT badly.  Of course, with lines like &quot;I've gotta hang on to my angst.&quot; one is tempted to give the guy some slack.  And DeNiro?  Let's say he doesn't embarass himself like Pacino, but his performance here is pretty much undistinguished--like most of his late 90's-early 00's output.<br />If it weren't for Mann's complete command of the action and a strong supporting cast, this would earn two stars.  Again, not a bad film by any means--just a downer after what I expected.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Tim Burton's Big Fish is about a man who has led anything but an ordinary life.  From working in a circus to befriending a giant, Edward Bloom has done it all.  He has done so much, seen so many things, that he has many stories to tell.  But to his son William, the stories his father tells get in the way him ever knowing what his father was really like.  Now that his father is nearing the end of his life, William takes it upon himself to determine who his father actually was, what he actually did, and how he actually led his life.  What William finds forces him to rethink his preconceptions about his father.<br />Big Fish is a wonderful story.  Chock full of color, beautiful imagery and metaphor, this movie, primarily examines the relationship between a father and son; but also attempts to answer the question of how someone might choose to lead their life if they knew, for certain, how they were going to die.  Think about it, if you knew for sure that you had 50 years left, what would you do?  What risks would you take?  What adventures would you embark upon?  When the day finally came to pass-on, could you look back upon your life and say that you made a difference?  Big Fish answers all of these questions...atleast for the life of Edward Bloom.<br />Tim Burton has crafted yet another amazing story.  Big Fish may not contain the graphic wizardry of A Nightmare Before Christmas (though there are some nifty special effects scenes) and may not be quite as haunting as Edward Scissorhands, but Big Fish stands alone as a tale that shows superbly the power that stories can have, and how they can change lives.
B00006M183|5.0|If you want anthemic, angry, youth-rock, you probably won't like Riot Act.  If you want Pearl Jam to regress to the songs of college frat parties and white-hat-wearing Jeep-drivers, you probably won't like Riot Act.  If you think \\"Alive\\" is a happy song about being alive, and all the joy that brings, you probably won't like Riot Act.  That said, I think it is a brilliant album-full of melancholy and torment, pathos, political and social frustration... yet, somehow, it is ultimately hopeful.  It's pleading and hoping that we'll all be okay; that there's always a beacon, even when things are at their worse.  And, I love that, upon a few listens, the listener can hear all the influences the band has claimed: from MC5 to The Who, from Neil Young to Nusrat Ali Fateh Khan.<br />This album is multifaceted, and, through this, it highlights all the qualities about the band that make them great-the qualities that have helped Pearl Jam overcome and outlast the hype.  You know, qualities like integrity and true musicianship.  It has the rockin' guitar solos, but it also has glorious acoustic work.  It has subtlety.<br />My personal favorite tracks are \\"Love Boat Captain,\\" \\"I am Mine,\\" \\"Green Disease\\" and \\"All or None.\\"  But that's this week.  Last week I was nuts over something else.  I find that each listen reveals a new gem.  In fact, after a hiatus with my Pearl Jam listening (yeah, I shelved them for awhile) buying this album renewed my interest in the two albums I'd not yet owned: Yield and Binaural.  Because of Riot Act, I came back to my obsession with Pearl Jam's music.  The album does \\"read\\" like a bit of a returning.  It is reflective, reflexive and unafraid.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Slipknot have not sold out, they have changed, and it is nothing like anything they've done before.  I am a little disappointed with the fact that it doesn't sound like their first album. It doesn't sound like the second album.  But that's what makes it great. It has some brutal songs on it, but corey has implemented his best talent, his voice.  Vol. 3 is an album that has shown how they have evolved as a band, and a sellout doesn't evolve.  Metallica for example put out the last album with no heart, it sounded like crap, the lyrics sucked, and they dropped the one thing that showed how great they are, guitar solos.  Slipknot kept everything and added things.  I like the acoustics and i like the singing.  I guess all I want to say is I have every album from Mate, Feed, Kill, Repeat-Vol. 3 and I can say I enjoy.  Nothing will ever compare to Slipknot-Slipknot and that is a good things.  If every song sounded the same you would get bored.  So enjoy it still has too much heart to say they have sold out.  The guitar solos rock, and the drumming is amazing on The Blister Exists.
B00000JGHS|1.0|This is a stunningly bad movie.  The plot is basically Demi Moore's character as a single mom who needs money so she works in a strip club (yes, stripping) and has men problems (crappy ex-husband, lecherous politician).  While Demi Moore looks great in this movie that was not even worth the two hours or so I wasted watching it.
B00004Y6TQ|5.0|I love this movie, and I was really impressed by the music. If you love Bjrk's sound, this will be what you know of her and a few new aspects. The way she used simple sounds to create the beats of \\"Cvalda\\" and \\"I've Seen It All\\" is amazing! \\"Cvalda\\"'s beat starts off with the sounds of noisy machinery in a factory and spirals into a beautiful song. \\"I've Seen It All\\" rests on the sounds of a train passing by. The beat you hear is the pattern of the wheels on the tracks, fixed up a little bit of course.      This album is an astonishing thing to listen to, even though there aren't many songs. It also lets you relive the movie, even the heartbreaking scene where Bjrk's character Selma dies. Buy it!

B00004XONN|5.0|Few albums have ignited as much controversy as Kid A - ranging from the die-hard adherents, who think that Radiohead somehow invented music, to the equally die-hard critics, who accuse the band of churning out pretentious crap.  Fortunately, a lot of that controversy has died down in the wake of Amensiac (generally tepid reactions) and Hail to the Thief (generally enthusiastic).  With some distance, we can approach Kid A again, and take it for what it is.<br />It's true that Radiohead didn't invent music, and if we wanted to talk about the musical avant-garde, we'd have to face the fact that popular music is a full century behind classical in that regard.  There's nothing that Radiohead is doing that breaks significantly from the tradition in which they are a part.  However, when 99% of the music industry is still stuck on 3 chord harmonic progressions, any attempts to move ahead are more than welcome.<br />That being said, there's a lot to love about Kid A, and album I initially hated, then grew to respect, and finally to love (much like my parents).  &quot;Everything in its Right Place&quot; plays with the ability of timbre to generate musical tension, while the initially jarring &quot;National Anthem&quot; makes more and more sense with each listen.  The standout track on the first half, however, is &quot;How to Disappear Completely,&quot; certainly Radiohead's masterpiece, a sustained and progressively intense ballad about feeling lost that literally melts away in the end.<br />It's become trite by now to say &quot;you have to listen to the songs in order,&quot; but you'll notice that the second half of the CD, like the second half of OK Computer, plays like a concept album, with a general emotional flow in place of a concrete plot.  In that respect, the otherwise weak &quot;Treefingers&quot; functions as an entr'acte between the two halves, leading to...<br />Optimistic (which is anything but)<BR>In Limbo (feeling lost)<BR>Idiotheque (mounting panic)<BR>MorningBells (giving up)<BR>Motion Picture Soundtrack (farewell)<br />There's a clear emotional arc there that accounts for the intense responses that patient listeners have gotten from the album. Even if each of the tracks weren't amazingly composed (which they are), the whole is outstanding, emotional draining, and absolutely fulfilling in a way that most albums aren't.  It's even a step up from the otherwise-magnificent OK Computer, insofar as Kid A feels more assured, and the soundscapes more completely realized.  <br />Wholeheartedly recommended.
B0000B3B95|5.0|I'm giving this movie five stars because of Eric Bana and the dark approach that Ang Lee took in interpreting this comic book character.  I am not a comic book fan and never read &quot;Hulk&quot; comics, I did watch a lot of the tv series in junior high and remember being sad about how Banner has to always leave and has to always keep moving on because of his dark, green secret.  That's probably why I appreciated the darker tone of this movie.  Now back to Eric Bana, I think this movie works because of him.  He has such a handsome, booding screen presence that is hard to ignore specially with those icy dark eyes.   It is easy to miss all these quality because at first he seem terribly average, but as the movie progresses, you can really see what a crafted actor he is.  Ang Lee made a good choice.  I know a lot of reviewers are complaining that this movie is too dark and misses the point of cartoons being fun and goofy.  But Lee's choice of having a darker almost horror movie like atmosphere bodes well with a lot of people who aren't into comic books, like myself.  I think the movie is well crafted and obviously well thought of, with Ang Lee wearing the electronic suit to see how to better direct the actors.  The DVD itself is chock full of extras and that's always well appreciated.  I highly recommend this movie from an action thriller, drama, Eric Bana fan prespective.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I would have never thought I would be compelled to write a review for any movie at a website.  This mini-series \\"Band of Brothers\\" moved me in such a profound way that I feel the need to express my gratitude to the filmmakers who brought this extraordinary masterpiece to television and DVD.   Please, do yourself a service and buy/watch this DVD and have an experience.  But, it's not for the faint of heart.<br />The story follows the story of a group of soldiers (Easy Company, 506th Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division) from boot camp in Georgia to Hitler's mountain palace at Berchtesgaden during WWII.   The casualties are high.  The pain is real.  This is a true story that transcends being a mere film.  You feel like you were allowed to go back in time and witness history in the making on a human level.<br />I was a television/film major in college, so I am familiar with filmmaking techniques.  \\"Band of Brothers\\" is perhaps the best war film ever made in this country (or anywhere) period.  It has the advantage of being a series - so it can go into depth like no 2-hour movie can.  The main characters can be fully developed and are.  The attention to detail is outstanding.  The filmmakers even created the series with a washed-out color quality like an old color photograph, which gives the viewer a psychological sense of the 1940's.   <br />You can feel the tension of the paratroopers approaching Normandy before the anti-aircraft fire.  You feel the panic to escape the aircraft before it is hit.  Many planes had to fly too low and too fast because of the clouds and the anti-aircraft fire.  The first-person camera shot of one soldier leaving the aircraft was very well done.<br />An example of the wonderful attention to detail is a scene where the defeated German soldiers march down the middle of autobahn as the Americans drove into Germany.  That shot exactly matched a WWII photograph I saw in a history book.  <br />The acting is exceptional.  You really feel that you know these people personally after a couple of hours.  When somebody is wounded or dies, you feel the loss and the pain.  When Lt. Winters shoots a young German soldier at close range, his pain comes through.  You know he will be haunted by this image the rest of his life (he later sees the same face on a young Frenchman on the train in Paris).<br />I am not going to presume that I could ever know how it feels to be in a foxhole freezing with enemy shells tearing down trees all around me, or the shear terror of rushing a village with friends falling all around me and bullets wheezing by my ears, but this is as close as a film can take me.  \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" was the only other war film that accomplished battle sights and sounds as real as \\"Band of Brothers\\".<br />This is a true tribute to Easy Company and all who died and sacrificed for our freedom.  Every American should watch this series and the documentary at some time in their life.  WWII was a long time ago, but we should not be quick to forget the real people that suffered, fought and died.  Watch and learn.  I had many a night in deep thought after watching every part of \\"Band of Brothers\\".
B00028HBKM|5.0|Reviewers who claim this film is antisemetic have lost the whole point of the movie and do not know Scripture. The Jewish priests were responsible because they were afraid of Jesus' impact on the people and the threat to their authority. They wanted Him out of the way.Read the Scriptures folks and don't get on the band wagon with those who have been crying fowl since the movie's inception. The film is accurate and follows the Gospels in addition to Gibson's own interpretation and the literary work The Dolorous Passion.<br />The movie is a masterpiece and will stand the test of time. Too<BR>many people want a revisionist version of history of the events<BR>and Mel didn't bite.
B00014X8KO|5.0|i first saw 'memories' in 1996 and i am still blown away by it everytime i watch it. and i watch it a lot. my fansub copy from way back when should soon be replaced by this dvd edition.<br />the first segment, 'magnetic rose' is my favorite anime of all time. how could it not be? although the story is based on the manga by Katsuhiro Otomo, 'magnetic rose' was directed by my all time favorite anime director Koji Morimoto. Not only that, but it was created and produced at one of my favorite anime studios of all time, Studio 4C. on a side note, my 2nd favorite anime is 'Porco Rosso' by Miyazaki/Studio Ghibli. <br />'magnetic rose' features lush visuals, high quality animation, top notch production and art design, and an intruiging story concept. very atmospheric and lyrical, the film is set to snippets of puccini's 'madame butterfly'. Characters moving in weightlessness are animated more convincingly than Gundam 0083 (ok, so it's a tv series, but it's still done pretty well), and concept design for space vehicles and ships are both functional and believable. backgrounds are beautifully painted as well. what many people may not realize is that quite a bit of cg is used in this film also. from the spaceships and flying pods to the rose itself, it is so well done that one may not quite realize it until a second viewing. the worlds of reality and illusion are cleverly blended in this film, and will keep you watching until the breathtakingly poetic ending. <br />if i was stranded on a desert island, all i would need would be wi-fi access to the net and this film. <br />the other two films in this series bear mentioning too.<BR>'stink bomb' is entertaining in its outrageous situations. if you like a lot of explosions in your anime, this is it. although i am not too fond of the character designs, the production values are still pretty good. while 'magnetic rose' could look like it was made yesterday, 'stink bomb' seems to show it's age in terms of art, line quality and design. <br />'canon fodder' reminds me very much of the films that came out of eastern europe during the height of their oppression. overall, much darker than the previous two films, 'cannon fodder' is a very interesting exercise in sweeping camera views and warped perspective background layouts. a bit of 3d cg is also used in this film and the character and concept designs are quite interesting. i highly recommend it for animation buffs. <br />now keep in mind that this anthology of films was released in 1996. now watch it, be blown away, then watch it again. now go out and buy the 'art of' book, &quot;the memory of memories&quot; and be blown away yet again. <br />and if you are interested in seeing more, i highly recommend looking up &quot;koji morimoto&quot; on the net and checking out his other works. one of his more recent being &quot;beyond&quot; on the 'animatrix' dvd (many of the better shorts in 'animatrix' were produced by studio 4C). i highly recommend his music videos as well, 'survival' and '4 day weekend' come to mind. and if you're looking for something really bizarre, don't pass up 'noiseman insect'<br />there are only 2 names you need to remember from this review: Koji Morimoto &amp; Studio 4C.<BR>Now, go out and buy it!
B000002KN8|4.0|Admittedly, this album is, superficially speaking, differently sounding than the rest of their (later) material.  But make no mistake: this album adheres to the DM aesthetic in many ways.  It forms its own unique niche in the history of this band.  And just like all of DM's other classic albums of the mid to late '80s and early '90s, it's superbly inventive, crafted, and produced electronic pop that strives to appeal to the highest common denominator of the record buying public.  As one reviewer wrote about this long ago: &quot;DM introduce literacy into bubblegum&quot;.<br />Compared to DM's later efforts, the lyrical content and melodies here are pretty fluffy.  But the underlying ideas here are great: Daniel Miller and the band went into the studio with the idea of creating an electronic pop album with a highly minimal Kraftwerkian aesthetic, but also with a poppy sweetness which had never been married to this style of music before.  Today the album sounds equally dated and relevant; in other words, great art that not only evokes the time in which it was made but also occupies its own irreplacable spot in this history of this band and perhaps in that of music as a whole.<br />Some may call me crazy, but I love this album for its classic electronic minimalism a la Kraftwerk, its almost total lack of pretense, and also just for the fact that its a blast to listen to.  But I would not recommend this as an introduction to the band for a first time listener as it, while certainly being very good, is neither their best nor a broad overview of Depeche Mode; instead purchase &quot;The Singles 81-85&quot; (which has the three singles released concurrently with &quot;Speak &amp; Spell&quot;), become further acquainted with the band and only then get this album and see it in the context of their later work (and that of other innovative electronic acts of the time like Kraftwerk).
B0000BYM3K|5.0|How many bands can release 23 full cds, in 24 years and still keep all of their qualities like sick guitar solos and of course the amazing singing.  And lets not forget the amazing artwork of Edward the Great on every cd cover.  This cd is as good as any of Maidens old cds and If you can get tickets to maidens show i would definately recommend them, its work the money.  The standout songs (even though i like all of them)  are Wildest Dreams, Rainmaker, No more lies, and dance of death.  Rainmaker and wildest dreams are the 2 singles so far and I heard no more lies is the next one.  So to sum it up Maiden is the best damn metal band ever and I would recommend to buy all 23 of their cds.
B0000524CY|1.0|Ifn this is the scariest movie, then people are scared really, really easy. Disney's &quot;Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad&quot; is scarier than this. This is a long movie, that could be shortened to half an hour and be sufficient. Only scary if you're highly catholic.
B00005JN0A|5.0|I saw this in the theater (one of few, sadly) and found it absolutely hilarious! I purchased the DVD today and well- it's still damn funny. Great music, fun cast, and very quotable. Even more the merrier if you've ever travelled in Europe as a youngster. They've also crammed a decent amount of extras onto the one disc as well.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|I guess it's safe to say that the maggots have no pulse. That's right...this album SUCKED. And I don't mean just bad...no no. It has horrible lyrics, horribly music; I could've done better blowing my nose while beating on a bed pan. What happened to the Slipknot we all met back in 1999? <BR>All I can say is that I'm glad I only spent $10 and not $20. This album isn't worth the time it took to make it. Wanna hear real metal? Go listen to Otep. They're great. Slipknot was great too. On this album however, they lost that greatness.
B0000019PA|5.0|This disc is one of the most amazing works I've come across... Really, Neutral Milk Hotel is not comparable to any other band out there, and really starts with a clean slate on this cd, and makes every song uniquely them. The first time through, I picked apart the lyrics, and took each song separately. After the once-over, just listening to the cd as a whole makes everything make a whole lot more sense. Not for the musically faint-of-heart, but if you give it a shot, it'll become a favorite. Few vocalists sing with so much fervor as Mangum, and the abstract lyrics make it all the better. The best songs are King of Carrot Flowers Part I, and Holland 1945, but it's the flow as a collection that makes each one better.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|I was sort of reluctant to see this movie when it first came out. Lots of reviews that I had read said it was good for the first 15 minutes and then went in a downward spiral from there. I also heard on the radio that the movie was three and a half hours long, and when a movie is that long, it's a big hunk of time that you need to take out of your day to watch the movie. Finally, I went to see the movie and I am glad I did. <br />I thought the opposite of what the reviews that I had read said. The first 15 minutes of the movie seemed like a sappy chick-flick movie about a son remembering storys that his dieing father had told him as a little boy, and then the rest of the movie sped up into a supernatural story of a man's life-long adventure. And the movie was a little over two hours, so I guess the radio lied. <br />Now for a little plot summary, that may give out some of the stuff that happens in the movie, continue reading. I'll try not to give too much away. Big Fish was the story of a father and a son who didn't speak in years, speaking to each other for the first time in that time. The son had always been told exagerations of the truth by his father (or so he thought), and got very annoyed at his Dad's fish stories. This meeting between the father and son was because the father had become very ill, and was about to die. From that point on, through a series of flashbacks, you got to see the fathers life story his way, told my many different narrators. Through the father's adventures, he befriended giants, joined the circus, fought in WWII in Japan and met up with a pair of Siamese Twins, found a perfect town, and then saved it, got married, caught a really big fish on the day his son was born and then let it go, and saw the way he would did in the glass eye of a witch. Then the father had a stroke. He was rushed to the hospital, and through much strain, asked his son to tell him the way that he would die, and then wispered the word river. He had never told his son what he had seen in the witch's glass eye, so the son had to make up the story of his fathers death which had to do with the river. After the son was done with the story, his fathers last words were &quot;Exactly!&quot; and died. At the funeral, you got to see all of the people from the fathers stories, and as a suprising truth to the son that it wasn't all made up.<br />The moral of the story: Sometimes telling a exgerated lie based on the truth is much better than hearing the truth itself. As the son found out, his father's version of how things happened was much more exciting and entertaining than the way they happened in reality. And it also proved that dieing doesn't need to be a sad thing if you go out the right way.<br />The movie had great special effects of the weird and supernatural too. Having 12 foot tall giants standing next to 6 foot men was a nice feat, although at some points you could tell when puppets were being used. The Siamese Twins were great and of course, the big fish in the movie was very realistic. It was very Tim Burton-ish.<br />For paying tribute to other movies. Big Fish did that alot. Many aspects of the movie reminded me of the movie Citizen Kane. From all of the different charactors telling their version of the story to the father weezing out &quot;the river&quot; (aka- rosebud) on his death bed, I found it very alike. I don't know if this one was purposeful, but the fathers wedding ring reminded me of the ring from Lord of the Rings. <br />Everything was consistent in this movie for the most part. There weren't any plot holes except for the Circus Ringmaster. At one point he turned into a wild wolf, and then switched back to human, and I didn't really understand the purpose behind this transformation. Maybe I should read the book that the movie is based on.<br />Overall, this is a great movie. Go and see it.
B000089CJI|5.0|I am so grateful to destiny that crossed the paths of Ben Gibbard and Jimmy Tamborello. Some time ago, the duo created \\"The Dream of Evan and Chan.\\" As soon as that was completed, they knew they were on to something spectacular. So Gibbard (from Seattle-based Death Cab for Cutie) and Jimmy Tamborello (from LA-based Dntel) used the USPS to produce a \\"synth-pop\\" record, setting demo CDs, ideas, and tracks via mail. Suitably, they call themselves The Postal Service. <br />Some may question The Postal Service's \\"rockability.\\" I assure you, The Postal Service does rock. You see, they have guitars like any other rock band but unlike most bands, they combine gee-tars with an electronic touch. They've taken that basic indie rock recipe, made some alterations and created something pretty damn unexpected. And we're all bubbling with excitement about this totally new flavor of indie fare. <br />Look forward to the usual Gibbard qualities: melody, pretty word choice, and crooning. This is quite possibly an extremely emo album, but when Ben tells you he's \\"thinking it's a sign that the freckles in our eyes are mirror images and when we kiss, they're perfectly aligned,\\" you can do nothing but melt. <br />(...)
B00006ZCFH|5.0|If you know anything about soul music, you would know that it is about growth, understanding and learning and this cd exemplifies all of the above.  If you are a fan of Ms. Badu, then you could see the progression from her first album to this one and be able to apreciate the new alternative stlye.  As another fan said, she is not a slave to pop culture and top 40 hits(which is a shame because as many people as possible should be introduced to her new style).  In my eyes her personal journey is as clear as day and as a young black woman, I can only hope to come as far as she in her personal journey towards understanding life. This album, on my list, is #1 of all time.
B0001HAISG|5.0|Sure this movie has it's flaws, but don't they all?  But this \\"Peter Pan\\" seems to have quite a few less than most movies coming out recently.  Some folks complain that it isn't really a \\"kid's movie\\" with all the violence and swordfighting and shooting.  And to them I say, \\"Did you actually ever read the book?!\\"  It is not a \\"children's book\\" though it is billed as one simply because it's got fairies and a boy who won't grow up.  This movie, in fact, throws in lots more things for the kids to be interested in than the book ever did.<BR>Anyway, despite some large changes, it holds to the feel of the book.  It also manages to pepper itself liberally with direct quotes: \\"Eyes as blue as forget-me-nots,\\" \\"nightlights are the eyes a mother leaves behind,\\" \\"a hidden kiss in the right-hand corner of her mouth that Wendy could never get.\\"  All were culled straight from the book.  Even the ingredients of Hook's poison were correct (and what child would understand a poison brewed from malice?).<BR>The acting is superb by everyone, though I was particularly entranced by Olivia Wood (Mrs. Darling) and was floored by the ever-so-sexy Jason Issacs (Captain Hook/Mr. Darling).  Rachel Hurd-Wood (Wendy) is a promising young actress and Jeremy Sumpter (Peter Pan) is bright and brash.  The special effects are gorgeous and lush, the colors highly saturated.  And (my most important point) it sticks to the book.  It is by far the closest to the feel and the plot of the original story.<BR>This is no Disney movie and no aging Mary Martin on strings either.  This is a vibrant new Pan, bursting off the stage and I suggest you take advantage of it now.
B0000C8AVR|5.0|In 1965, Bob Dylan released HIGHWAY 61 REVISITED, arguably the single most important record in 1960s rock.  A total break with anything occurring in popular music before (save Dylan's own albums), HIGHWAY 61 REVISITED merged biting, sharp lyricism and great garage-rock and blues.  When most other bands were singing about boy-girl topics and writing insubstantial lyrics (in 1965 The Beatles were singing \\"You're gonna lose that girl\\"), Dylan combined edgy, hip lyrics with garage rock, blues, and epic folk.  His voice, rough hewn and very off-kilter technically, rewrites the rules for rock vocals.  As Mark Prindle says, Dylan's voice turned off a lot of people, but influenced a whole lot more.<br /><br />\\"Like a Rolling Stone,\\" Dylan's most famous song, kickstarts HIGHWAY 61 with a sledge hammer.  Significant as the single that broke the three minute barrier Dylan berates a woman, very much trying to be with the `in' movement.  Filled with images never before conceived with in pop music, this song sets the tone of the rest of the album, and indeed this period of Dylan's life.  \\"Ballad of a Thin Man,\\" however, proves itself to be the really brutal put-down to all those to unwilling to open their minds and see where the counter-culture was headed.  \\"Mr Jones,\\" the acrimonious protagonist, finds himself thrown into a world of freaks, and he simply doesn't know what is happening.  He is wealthy, well-read, and in all likelihood corporate - the very materialism and hypocrisy the youth of the 1960s were so ardent to overthrow.  (Many 1960s' youth turned into 1980s' yuppies;  that is neither here nor there.)<br /><br />The very confrontational break with the folk community informs this entire work.  The folk community were still idolizing Dylan, and Dylan, being Dylan, abandoned the role, much to their anger.  Dylan was following his own muse, transforming himself from a protest singer into a cynical, avant-guard musician, very much a counter-cultural icon, exerting enormousinfluence over the rest of the fellow musicians as well as the growingly despondent youth culture.  Ironically, Dylan would likewise abandon this role for a more mellow, country direction, and anger the counterculture just as much as he angered the folk fans, which is why I believe SELF PORTRAIT is the perfect capstone to Dylan's 1960s work.  Because it's Dylan being contrary and inscrutable.  That album's infamous for a reason folks.<br /><br />This transformation, while occurring over the past two albums, comes to full fruition here, and with such offerings as the lead off track, \\"Tombstone Blues,\\" \\"Ballad of a Thin Man,\\" and \\"Desolation Row,\\" this is nothing short of essential listening.  \\"Desolation Row,\\" arriving a full year and a half ahead of the other great epic in classic rock, The Doors' \\"The End,\\" feels like a journey down a twisted, malignant, decaying road through America, with surrealism abounding and one of the best (and most accessible) answers to T. S. Eliot's modernist masterpiece `The Waste Land.\\" \\"Tombstone Blues,\\" combining (like the rest of the album) complex, surrealistic imagery and characters given an almost mythological import with seemingly random juxtapositions, rewrote the rules of rock lyrics.  It has quite the absurdist touch.<br /><br />The remaining tracks are just as remarkable.  \\"It Takes a Lot to Laugh, a Train to Cry\\" musically turns to the blues for its inspiration, but the lyrics are a far cry from the classic blues motifs.  \\"From a Buick Six,\\" based partially on the 1930 Sleeping John Estes \\"Milk Calf Blues,\\" shows Dylan reinventing the blues with a visceral fist.  \\"Queen Jane Approximately,\\" a dire warning directed to an obviously important woman in the narrator's life, chugs along at a loose, warm, garage frenzy.  The narrator warns Queen Jane that she's about to fall apart.  Wrapping the message in symbolism, the listener is left wondering if she's a real person in Dylan's life or not.  \\"Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues,\\" one ofmy personal favorites (I wrote a story about New York City using these lyrics as inspiration), details a character's descent into a continually more startling and depressing lifestyle, filled with corrupt authorities, shady women, and a haze of drugs and alcohol.  Rich with literary allusions, writing like this sets Dylan head and shoulders above any other lyricist.  \\"Highway 61 Revisited,\\" the very song that game the album its name, gives another example of Dylan's surrealistic, stream-of-conscious type of writing, part beat, part symbolist, and undeniably all Dylan.  The opening stanza, with its 1960s' reinvention of God telling Abraham to kill his son Isaac, stands as a stroke of genius.  Some commentators have pointed out there's Highway 61 in Minnesota, and that Dylan's father's name was Abe.  Dylan populates the rest of the song with royalty, roving gamblers, and other colourful characters.  One of Dylan's best songs, with a rollicking bit of music to go with the mind-bending lyrics.<br /><br />Two tracks, recorded during the same sessions and cut very much of the same cloth, would have found a welcome home on this album.  \\"Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?\\" a bizaare narrative about a guy trying to win back his love, broke the top 100 but wasn't very successful.  Somewhat akin to \\"I Want You\\" in the bizaare pop department.  \\"Positively Fourth Street,\\" one of Dylan's biggest hits and one of the nastiest put downs ever committed to tape, shows Dylan totally demolishing a so-called friend.  It's one of Dylan's best mid 1960s offerings (and that's saying something, let me tell you) and appears on the first GREATEST HITS album.<br /><br />HIGHWAY 61 REVISITED's most radical facet is it brought rock and popular music to a totally unprecedented level of sophisticated, artistic mastery.  Dylan made music both deeply poetic and complex, redefining rock as we know it.  Is it Dylan's best?  Maybe.  It is certainly one of his most important, not only for his careerbut for rock in generall.  While many people point to The Beatles' SGT PEPPER as the seminal record of the 1960s, HIGHWAY 61 REVISITED is where my money is at.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|Let go was BAD enough..I listened to the whole album (my friend is obsessed with her..) she sucks.. common avril! put just a little effort into your music! If you are looking for decent pop DONT BUY THIS ALBUM!
B000002LQR|5.0|13 years after its release I still put this record in my CD player quite often. It may very well be the best CD I have - filled with funky beats, great punching lyrics, fabulous instrumental work and melodies of another world. Rocking fast tracks, the most beatiful slow songs ever, and feel-good funk for a hot summer day. Blood sugar sex magik has it all - and will never go out of style.<br />Very possibly the best album of the nineties, from a remarkably good band. If you are just gonna buy one CD this year, buy two, so you have one spare just in case. If you already have Blood Sugar Sex Magik and us just gonna buy one CD this year- buy one extra too keep in a vault. You never know what's gonna happen...
B00008H2LB|5.0|Don't listen to people who say that &quot;Meteora&quot; is &quot;Hybrid Theory Part II&quot;. Every band has their own sound, Linkin Park's is one of a million. From track 1 to 13 it's a blast. From the vocals of Chester (The lead singer) to Mr. Hahn's turn tables (the DJ). The artwork inside the CD gives you a state of mind of the cd or a theme if you will. Not a lot of bands to that anymore. I think thats it's a offical that Linkin Park has dominated New Age Rock.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Joss Whedon is fast becoming my absolute favorite writer/creator/producer/and anything else I may have missed.  The man is just great.  Following up previous successes &quot;Buffy The Vampire Slayer&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot;, Mr. Whedon brings us the world of the Firefly class ship &quot;Serenity&quot;.  This show is kind of a sci-fi, western adventure series that follows a ragtag group of salvage collectors that is running from the Alliance (a universal govenment body) and is protecting two fugitives.  As with other Whedon material, Disney/Pixar's &quot;Toy Story&quot; included, he builds a world with first class characters and character development.  The end result is a can't take your eyes off of addicting show!
B00005JMGL|5.0|I loved this movie, and so did my mother and two children!!! This new version of Peter Pan, based on the original writting of J.M. Barrie, was the best ever brought to a feature film, and the only one that had an actual boy instead of a woman, or a 40 something year old man!!!!  Jeremy Sumpter was superbly cast for the lead role of Peter Pan, charming, energetic, cocky, but with a touch of sweetness, and realness that just captivates you.  Jason Isaacs, and the young Rachel (Hook,Darling, and the young interest of Pan, Wendy), along with the lost boys and all the other casted characters were just wonderful.  Hopefully this version will become a classic for generations to come!!  I am very surprised that I didn't hear rave reviews about this movie when it hit movie theaters.  I would definitely suggest for those that didn't see it or prejudged the movie all togethor, to go and rent or even better, go buy this movie!!!!!  Trust me you'll enjoy it!!!  For everyone , not just children or young teens, this movie grabs at the heart of everyone!!!  It makes you remember the feeling of youth, first loves, being carefree, and always looking for an adventure!!!!  I am the biggest kid at heart and always will be!!!  P J Hogan did a great job directing this movie and I love him for it!!  So go ahead, Neverland isn't that far away, think happy thoughts and its the second star to the right and then straight on til morning!!!
B000002MFE|5.0|Clapton is fantastically versatile. From the Yardbirds through Cream and The Dominos, everyone who grew up in the 60s knew Eric as the best modern guitar player ever (forget it, Jimi) but even more than that, he speaks directly to every member of his audience through his music in a riveting way.<br />Here, on acoustic guitar, accompanied by one of the greatest pianos you'll ever hear, Eric Clapton sings the blues. Alone onstage to the world.<br />I don't understand why Eric Clapton and Doc Watson have never gotten together. THAT would be something for the ages. But in the mean time, you'll have to buy separate CDs.
B00004RFFI|2.0|This film is your typical Hollywood multi-million dollar pice o' crap made for summer. There is no compelling plot. There are only special effects. If effects are all you care about, fine ... buy it. If you want to think or enjoy a plot turn or well-developed characters, you don't have to read this review to know this isn't the film for you. This is the tipical insert-your-own-disaster-here attempt to entertain the masses. It's tired and hard to sit through. I give it a second star only because of \\"the cow\\" and good special effects.

B000002I2G|1.0|I have to voice an opinion on this one.  Total junk.  Soft Parade, Wild Child &amp; Touch Me are pretty solid, but as far as deep cuts are concerned, this album brings nothing close to what LA Woman &amp; Morrison Hotel brought.   This should be the last Doors album you buy, to complete a well worthwhile collection, yet purchase well after the live shows and Morrison's American Prayer.
B000002I8D|4.0|Phil Collins' reputation has suffered substantially over the past twenty years. He may not have been mentioned by either David Brent or Alan Partridge, but it feels like it. Many Genesis fans haven't quite forgiven him for admitting that, before the 'We Can't Dance' album, the band deliberately decided to &quot;sell out&quot;, in his words. Maybe it was the rapid drift towards MOR in his solo albums, the chain of failed marriages, or simple jealousy of his money-making, but the critics have not been kind to our Phil in recent years.<br />I bought this as an LP when it first came out, and have now bought it as part of the new 3CD pack released in 2004 that is excellent value. I must admit I hadn't played the album for 20 years, and it really takes me back. In 2001, his stock was really high: he had been a fantastic vocal replacement for Peter Gabriel in Genesis, and he had won critical acclaim for his spare-time band, the jazz-rock specialists Brand X. So what if he did the odd cover of a Motown hit, or did the occasional pop video? It just added to the fun, and potentially seemed capable of bringing a mainstream audience to jazz-rock.<br />People coming to 'Face Value' for the first time may wonder what the dominant style is, 'In the Air Tonight' apart. And the answer is jazz-rock. Well, one band in particular: Weather Report. Listeners are strongly advised to buy that band's 'Heavy Weather' and 'Black Market'. (It is no coincidence that Genesis's concert drummer was Chester Thompson, who had also played drums on 'Black Market', nor that the bassist on that album was Al Johnson, who also plays on 'Face Value'.) Basically, 'Face Value' was a popularised version of Weather Report, updated with vocals and drum machines.<br />(Incidentally, the following year, long before the Prince's Trust ever existed, Phil was invited to play alongside Eric Clapton on John Martyn's 'Glorious Fool' LP.)<br />But Collins has always been a great opportunist, and he was sensitive to whatever style of music that the greatest number of fans liked. So the jazz-rock tendencies disappeared from subsequent albums, to be replaced by the MOR fug. The trouble was that Phil was a fair singer, drummer, pianist and composer, without being brilliant at any one of these activities. It's no clear if he will be remembered another 25 years from now for anything except 'In the Air Tonight', and to be frank, engineer Hugh Padgham deserves much of the credit for the sound of that song.<br />Enjoy this album for what it hoped to achieve -- i.e. to bring jazz-rock to a larger audience -- and weep for the fact that the larger audience later pulled Phil away from jazz-rock and towards the MOR.tever style of music that the greatest number of fans liked.

B00005JN0A|5.0|i so loved this movie. it was so funny. i like when the guy had the thing around his chest with the passports and maps in it and when the mugger came at the wrong time when he was getting oral the mugger thought he was telling him that he loved him but he really was talking to the girl. and i like when they drunk so much the twins made out. i like when the guy went through all that stuff to get that t-shirt. i like when michelle tragenberg bent over in the movie and the guy thought it was another girl because u know they don't think of her as a girl. i also like when the men was on the beach and they had those little pennis' i was crakkin' up at thet theater, and when she about to get nude. THE REAL REASON I WENT TO SEE THE MOVIE IS BECAUSE MICHELLE PLAYS IN IT AND IM A BIG FAN OF HERS, AND IT ALSO LOOKED EXCITING. Thank u

0618526412|1.0|This book was slow and painful from beginning to end.  The only reason I stuck with it was to see how everything tied together in the end.  Very disappointed with the ending, but a relief to finally finish.
B0001HAISG|5.0|I have a child.  I have seen EVERY version of Peter Pan made -- many many times.  Imagine my *delight* at seeing yet another version (sarcasm here) when the film came out in theaters.  I have to admit, however, that I was immediately and continuously impressed by this superb adaptation of J.M. Barrie's classic children's tale, and bought the dvd as soon as it came out.<br /><br />The cast is absolutely perfect.  Jeremy Sumpter in the title role is wonderful, bringing a mischievous energy and boyishness to the part that has been amazingly and consistently missing (having been played by Mary Martin and Robin Williams).  I'll also single out Rachel Hurd-Wood as Wendy and Jason Isaacs as Captain Hook/Mr. Darling for their great performances, but the entire cast is terrific.<br /><br />The script is spectacular, exploring the subtext of the Pan story in a simple but profound way that puts film critics' shameless psycho-jargon to shame.  It is the kernel of truth wrapped round a rousing adventure story -- replete with cruel pirates, brave Indians, sinister mermaids and loyal parents. Captain Hook's cruelty is evident, but takes place mostly off-screen and is never gory.  This is a thinking (little) person's Peter Pan, certainly, drawing as it does on previously unexplored themes of the complexity of growing up, the consequences of our choices, and the acceptance of our children as they grow up, but it's also a gorgeous realization of Barrie's (and Wendy's) fantastical imagination.<br /><br />DVD extras are quite entertaining and include: an alternate ending, deleted scenes, Jason Isaacs' video diary, &#34;The Legacy of Pan&#34; with Sarah Ferguson, and a number of micro-minifeaturettes on flying, sets, etc.  Too bad it lacks a commentary track but otherwise lots of fun.<br />For Pan fans, highest possible recommendation; for all others, see above.

B0001Z363W|4.0|Zakk's hangover music is the perfect tonic if you're looking for the more subtle side to BLS, ala disc 2 of the &quot;Live&quot; release and &quot;Shadows.&quot;  Zakk goes off on some tunes here, or maybe it's his crusty vocals nurtured by alcohol that gives these songs a rougher edge.  Standout hits include Crazy or High, House of Doom, and Won't Find It Here (all classic amped-down Zakk Trakks).  Lotsa passion in Zakk's singing-- which sounds like a cross of Greg Allman meets Axel Rose.  Not quite as good as Book of Shadows, but not bad either.  Definitely check it out!
B00007FCTH|1.0|Don't buy this version of Citizen Kane.  1.) Two of the DVDs come stacked on top of each other, something Warner Brothers (the makers of the regular and collector's version) highly do not recommend.  2.)  Hairline cracks:  my first copy came with hairline cracks in the feature disc and with severe cracks in one of the supplemental discs; my second copy came with hairline cracks in one of the supplemental discs; again Warner Brothers themselves warned me not to play a disc with hairline cracks.  3.) Within 5 minutes of buying this version the glue on the box failed and it started to fall apart.<BR>I thought the problem was with Warner Brothers, but they disowned any connection to the gold version.  Save yourself the headache and just get the special edition version and not the Gold.
B00006L9ZT|2.0|After watching this set of dvds, I can only say that I'm bored by most of it. The staging and direction is often dull and the acting is mostly rigid. The singing is mediocre, and Hildegard Behrens well past her prime. The saving grace is the excellent performance of the Met orchestra under Levine. But the odds still win the day at the end.
B00007KWHP|4.0|but this album (the new remastered one) is very worthwhile, no matter your devotion to the band. In addition to the classic tracks, it includes a bonus of (among others) the 10-minute version of 'America', a minor hit which is almost undistinguishable as a Paul Simon tune, and quite good. <br />The instrumentals featured on this are not my faves, tho, and are mere filler. Otherwise this would get 5 stars. A good place for the Yes beginner to start...
B00003CXAE|5.0|A film by Randal Kleiser<br />Danny (John Travolta) and Sandy (Olivia Newton John) have a summertime romance in the late 50's, but it ends when the summer does and Sandy has to go back to Australia.  It is time for a new school year at Rydell High, and Danny is a Senior.  He is a member of the T-Birds gang (which feels like a more innocent version of what we'd think of as a gang), the leader of the group.  Sandy had told Danny that she had to go back to Australia, but she ends up starting school at Rydell also, unaware that Danny is there.  Danny is the cool greaser, popular with the ladies and with a reputation to uphold.  Sandy is the sweetest girl next door that you are ever likely to find.  When they meet up again, they are excited to see each other, but it doesn't work because Danny is hiding behind his reputation and behaves accordingly.<br />As a musical, this film is absolutely wonderful.  It harkens back to a more innocent time, and while this film is a bit more sexual than you might expect from a PG rated movie, it is very sweet and charming.  Most of the songs are great, fit the scene and do not have that stereotypical \\"it's time to burst into song\\" feel.  The songs feel like a more natural extension of the character and scene and sometimes even feel like what they might actually say at that point.  Stockard Channing steals all of her scenes as Rizzo, the leader of the Pink Ladies.  Her two big songs \\"Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee\\" and \\"There are Worse Things I Could Do\\" are highlights of the movie, along with the classic \\"Summer Nights\\" (Travolta and Newton John), \\"Beauty School Dropout\\" (Frankie Avalon), and \\"You're the One that I Want\\" (Travolta, Newton John).  The one complaint that I do have is that I much prefer Sandy as the girl-next-door over her new look at the end of the film.  All the characters act like it is the greatest thing since sliced bread, but all that it is showing me is that Sandy has to change who she is in order to get a guy to like her.  Or, maybe I am thinking too much about this.  The bottom line is that this movie is a blast and it is my favorite musical.  \\"Grease\\" is one of my favorite movies and is a modern classic, even if it is a little campy.  I don't know how well it will age over the next twenty years, but for now: Grease is the word.<br />-Joe Sherryher.  Or, maybe I am thinking too much about this.

B000002U8G|5.0|I WILL KEEP THIS SHORT AND SWEET<br />It wasn't until I had fully submersed myself in Wish you were here, Animals, Dark side of the Moon and The Wall that I had finally came to find this incredible album.  Every song on the album is incredible.  From the hard nature of &quot;One of these days&quot; to the soft and sweet ballads of &quot;A pillow of winds&quot; this album will make you fall in love with this band.<br />The most stand out song on the album is &quot;Echoes&quot;, taking up a whole side on the original LP.  This remains my most loved floyd song and it is something that you can listen to over and over and still here things that you completely missed the first five times you listened to it.  At 23 mins, this song is truely what you would call and epic (Lords of the Rings style) and I recommend laying on a bed and listening to it on a nice stereo your first few times.  The song builds from a single &quot;ping&quot; note on Rick's piano and to an incredible rythm that will take your breath away.  The lyrics are beautiful and poetic and the way they are sung will make you want to weep with ecstasy.  My favorite part of the song is the simple yet brillaint two chord jam session that fades into pure ambience.  Oh... that reminds me... one reviewer said that they use wind tape effects during the middle section of the song.  I used to think the same thing but after seeing &quot;live at Pompeii&quot; I saw that the band is creating that noise with there instrements.  Roger Waters is basically making that willowing wind noise by rhtymically waving his slide over the strings and running his bass into a wah-wah pedal.  This is great because you see that it is more then just playing a tape to get a wierd sound... they are actually making it.  To put it blunt... get this album then move on to Atom Heart Mother and Ummagumma.  After that you will be a Floyd junky as I am.<br />P.S.  FOR A COOL EXPERINCE PLAY ECHOES TO STANLEY KUBRICK'S 2001:  A SPACE ODDESSYE.  TO DO THIS CUE UP THE SONG THEN GET THE MOVE TO THE FINAL SEGMENT &quot;TO JUPITER AND TO INFINITY&quot;.  WHEN THE SCREEN GOES DARK, AFTER THE CLOSE UP OF THE SPACEMAN'S FACE, PLAY THE SONG SO THAT THE FIRST PING PLAYS AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE TITLE &quot;TO INFINITE&quot; COMES UP.  GET IT PERFECT THEN SIT BACK AND ENJOY!!!!  PEACE OUT!!!
B0001RVTXO|5.0|a masterpiece. An absolutely brilliant collection of songs by a band worthy of all the praise. This is high energy, soul-invigorating music that set the bar so very high for all other bands calling themselves \\"rock\\" bands. Anyone who has seen Frank Black in his glory for the past few years will know that The Pixies show is a must.
B00005JMFQ|2.0|Because of the gifted cast and director, I had high hopes for a pleasantly distracting evening with this film--alas, twas not to be.  I'm not sure if Curtis was A) cynically going for profit and the Ulitimate Cheese Factor, B) making an over-the-top parody of himself and/or modern romances, or C) really has an infantile view of adult relationships, but this movie simply didn't work for me or my wife (and we normally love the type of film the reviewers touted this to be).<br />The characters were nearly all stereotyped caricatures of a thirteen-year-old's idea of adults.  The mini-story presented by Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman was the best by far, and the film would have been much better if this were the central plot, dispensing with much of the rest.  All of these actors are so much better than the crudely drawn and simplistic people Curtis has them portraying, and many (especially Hugh Grant) seem to be merely playing satirical versions of the roles that made them &quot;famous&quot; rather than making serious attempts to give depth to the roles.<br />Still, I can't fault the acting, really.  The cast seems to have made the best of the material given them--the flaw of the film is the insultingly juvenile script, abetted by some surprisingly amateurish (or ineptly manipulative) direction on the part of Curtis.<br />Sorry for the negative review, but I hope to warn viewers expecting an entertaining, mature film with some depth to it.  Although there are a few good scenes, overall this film is superficial and false, filled with incredibly unrealistic actions and dialog, never allowing me to suspend disbelief for more than a minute or two at a time.
0743529790|5.0|The best book I've read this year. I've passed the CD on to my husband and a number of friends. They all loved it and couldn't stop listening.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Avril co-wrote every song on this album with help from Evan Taubenfeld, Chantal Kreviazuk and Ben Moody making this a more mature sounding album than her last CD LET GO . If you didnt like her before, you should definitly atleast give this one a chance, its already number 1 in 11 different countries around the world. Unlike Let Go , this CD has more darker songs reaching out to an older mature audience
B0000088ZV|4.0|This is an early progressive rock masterpiece that was released during the end of the psychedelic era (1969).  Psychedelic influences such as raga guitar solos, phasing, vocal distortion, and mellotron are all over Mercator Projected.  East Of Eden can certainly hold their own instrumentally next to a band such as King Crimson. Nothern Hemisphere is a great piece of hard rock with echoed vocals and fat guitar riffs.  The band plays hard and heavy throughout making this album one of progressive rocks loudest moments. Waterways is an atmospheric composition devoted to distorted vocals and violin playing.  Towards the middle of this standout composition the band explodes into a raga rock solo.  Absolutely Brilliant!!!!!  Centuar Women is an excellent, powerful blues-rock track that eventually delves into some free form playing. This album certainly deserves it's lost classic status.  For fans of early progressive rock or psychedelia, this album is a no-brainer!!
B0001DI0FI|5.0|Great DVD with lots of indepth bonus features. For someone who loves the movie there are hours and hours of additional behind the scenes featurettes to explain how it all came about.  Unlike some bonus features you get a real appreciation for what it took - start to finish - to create a real adventure on the ocean.<br />As a movie this is very good compared to most recent attempts to portray heroism.  Crowe is perfect as Capt. Jack.<br />As a fan of the Patrick O'Brian books that inspired this movie I was impressed with the overall production and script of this movie.  In fact, this movie is in many ways better than the books, which were a bit overrun with an abundance of naturalistic descriptions that often slowed down the plotline to the point of boredom.<br />The very act of trying to translate the books to the screen seems to have neccesitated the deletion of the naturalistic elements in favor of keeping the story moving.<br />Kudos to the creators and actors of this one for a very enjoyable experience.
0783232039|5.0|This film is funny, but also is suspenseful and has a few terrifying and jumpy bits in it. I think is was one of the best Chucky films and it is worth seeing and purchasing this movie. The ending was shocking and it was a thrill ride of laughter and screams. I am looking forward to the next Chucky but I don't believe it could possibly match this one .I gave it 5 stars because I was never bored and I could watch it over and over again any time because it was truly a master piece.
B00004XOWM|1.0|I'm sorry, diehard Limp fans, but their guitarist is amaturish, Boylen sucks, Linkin Park's Mike Shinoba is 100 times better than DJ Lethal, and...where do I even begin with Fred Durst? First, the only words he can seem to rhyme are swear words, he sounds like either he has his nuts in a vice or he's going through puberty at age 30.  I can't think of a single good thing to say about this CD or any other CD the Limp Bizkit ever released except that it made them a lot more money than I make (which really isn't fair).
B00018TI5E|5.0|I'm surprised that a few reviewers dislike the track &quot;Water.&quot; I've played this album several dozen times and my two favorite songs are the first, &quot;Carvel,&quot; and one further into the album, &quot;Water.&quot; The ending &quot;coda&quot; on &quot;Water&quot; is pure Frusciante at his absolute greatest. Also, I'm pretty sure it is Chad Smith who is providing the heart-pounding drumming on &quot;Water.&quot; Wow, how amazing! As Chad reduces his drum kit to matchsticks, the engineer makes some strange sonic experiments with the eq knobs. Oh yes, I love this whole album from start to finish, but for me, the song &quot;Water&quot; is just beautiful and perfect. I'm happy as can be. <br />Coming soon...six albums by John Frusicante before year's end!! Wow, when does he have time to eat or sleep? He recorded The Will to Death on a sixteen track analog reel to reel a la 1971! He has said that &quot;no&quot; computers were used at any stage in the recording or mixing. So be sure to check that one out as I am sure it will sound really warm and rich, in other words, you won't have to put up with the nasty &quot;clipping&quot; that mars releases such as Californication. That will be good, as &quot;clipping&quot; can be really annoying at times. <br />Rock on!!
6304493681|5.0|Well, how can i start. Awsome out the Ying-Yang!! Well, I've been an anime fan for about a year now, and I actually have just watched this movie recently. The sci-fi genre of anime is broad and expansive, and sometimes its hard to pick out those titles that, well, stand out. This is one of those few and far between titles that does stand out. I reccomend that any fan of anime, or anyone in general, watch this title. It will leave you thinking for hours on end about how this story could really happen and what if it DID happen. Not to draw this review out into deep dark waters of the future, so I've said it once and I'll say it again, watch this title.
B000066C1N|5.0|I recently got this CD after wanting it for about 2 years. I'm so happy the waiting is over! I listen to it all day, loving each moment of every song! When you're feeling down in the dumps, &quot;Sound the Bugle&quot; is there to lift your &quot;Spirit&quot;s! Feeling romantic? Try &quot;Nothing I've Ever Known&quot;. When angry or under stress, why not listen to &quot;Get Off My Back&quot;? This CD has a song for everybody, and it's definetly worth every penny.
B000003BEM|5.0|The Stones have never made a complete dud, but I just think the 60's albums were the most fun. &quot;Beggar's Banquet&quot; is sort of the &quot;unplugged&quot; concept (with the odd very electric exception), but it doesn't get soft in any way. There is some country, folk, blues, rock, and it is played so damn pure! &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot; is great, just as dark as any Black Sabbath tune, and likely the song you'll buy this for. &quot;Stray Cat Blues&quot; is not blues at all, but a great hard rock tune. After that, it's mostly acoustic numbers, but they hit you HARD. It's more mature than the earlier stuff, darker than what came later, and it's one of the best things ever made. Not particularly experimental, it falls through the cracks when critics make their &quot;best of&quot; lists, BUT, I would say this is the BEST non-metal hard rock album of all time. Also the best album of 1968, and that sais something.
B0001KL5DA|5.0|Although I subscribe to premium TV channels which carry this series, I actually got hooked when I bought the first season DVD collection.  The transfer was superb and the 5.1 soundtrack made the listening experience that much more involving.  I've already signed up to be notified when the third season becomes available, and I hope it doesn't take as long as season two.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|k, first of all.. all you people that say that avril is a bunch of crap and say that areosmith is awesum are just gay. i mean at least avril doesnt sing about the gayest color... pink! i mean come on! you cant think of anything better to write about??? at least avril writes about REAL things. sure they sound popish but at least they are REAL! and at least she writes her own music unlike slutney spears. if slutney wasnt as hott as she is (which is ONLY because of plastic surgery!) she wouldnt have any fans! avril doesnt NEED to dress sexy to sell music, but she is really hott! and her new cd rocks!! and she cant be that bad beacuse her cd debuted at number 1! and she doesnt need other people to do her song writing for her!
0743216458|5.0|Band of Brothers is a good book. I think it is a good because it is filled with sarrow<BR>And is full of action.

B000002U9L|5.0|First I'd like to start by saying, I'm a huge David Bowie fan! The movie Labrynth is responsible for turning me on to David Bowie.  He appeals to such a broad audience, that even at the age of 8 I was an instant fan and now my 6 year old son is begging to go to a concert. This soundtrack is a wonderful expression of David's versatility.  I can't imagine it's an easy task to write music for a children's movie.  Especially when he's spent most his time with an adult audience.  But as usual, David brings his unparralled musical talents to this soundtrack!  I highly recommend this soundtrack and movie to everyone.
0380002930|5.0|Watership down was an exelent book. This was the best book I have ever read. It has very suspensfull momments and great batteles. There was great adventure and pretty cool moments. If you like books where animales fight this is the book for you.This book is so good you will wish it never ended.this book is better than most redwall books by far it is more realistic and it is just better. When I read the readwall book I thought I had found my favorite books but after I read watership down. I did not want to put it down.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|I hate Slipknot ever since I bought their first album I just couldn't get into their sound.  They tried to pass off as death metal with their second album which was still horrible and still nu-metal.  I was sick of the lead vocalist spouting his love for Deicide and Cannibal Corpse yet he couldn't sound like Glen Benton, Chris Barns, or George Fisher if he tried.  His vocals weren't deep enough, gutteral, banshee scream like(Peter of Hypocrisy), raspy vocals (about every blackmetal vocalist you could think of), nor phlegm vomiting like (ala Carcass' style).  At least on this release he relizes he can't sing that style, he also stops the rapping, stops the stupid hydrolic garbage can drumming stuff and finally finds more of a hard rock approach.  It's the year of the 3rd time is the charm (ala Finger Eleven and Staind).  I tell you right now that approach sounds way better than their posuer pseudo-deathmetal but really nu-metal outings.  I still hate the lead singer and his attitude.  He's more of a jerk than Glen Benton is, who is pretty much nothing but hot air and probably even more intelligent.  Heck I'll even go a step over that he's more of a jerk than Varg (Burzum) is.  However I owe him for taking a different approach for once.  I'll actually get this album and for once listen to a Slipknot album without cringing.
0385510438|1.0|I was disappointed in this book.  I always look forward to Grisham's books, and have read all of them.  This one was too slow, and I almost stopped reading.  Instead, I skimmed.  He seemed wander a lot, and I never was sure where he was headed.  I hope he does better with his next one.
B0000025L8|5.0|Anytime you hear anyone talking about the greatest album in rock history with at least a dozen songs that they can't bear to listen to, you should immediately think of the Clash's masterpiece of musical diversity, &quot;Sandinista!&quot;.  Those who are only familiar with this band through the remarkable &quot;London Calling&quot; or their commercial breakthrough &quot;Combat Rock&quot; will undoubtedly be perplexed by the stupefying array of musical directions taken during this two CD set from 1980.<br />No matter what you think as a listener, the stylistic m&eacute;lange has a definite purpose: to show the universality of fundamental human concerns about oppression, violence, poverty, and despair, and also the universality of music itself, as an expression of these concerns.  As The Only Band That Matters, the Clash's main strength has always been their songwriting: indignant, sardonic, but always heartfelt in their concern for the downtrodden.  Anthems such as &quot;Magnificent Seven&quot;, &quot;Up In Heaven&quot;, &quot;Police on My Back&quot;, and &quot;The Call Up&quot; are equal to anything in the band's oeuvre, and still serve to remind us of the ideals that once made rock music seem relevant.  And sure it's tempting to skip over the more off-the-wall selections (some of which foreshadow the coming of so-called &quot;world music&quot; and some of which are just plain annoying), but that's taking the easy way out, and at this point in their career, the Clash just wasn't ready to do that. Perhaps we shouldn't either.<br />But the simple fact is that most listeners today are less interested in the band's politics than in the music itself, and that's where the album's diversity can be problematic.  How many of us can honestly say that we're strongly connected to all the various musical styles that the Clash attempt over the course of these disks?  To this reviewer's ears, the rock and funk tracks still stand up very well, but what is to be made of the band's forays into dub, Irish folk music, calypso, the minuet, cocktail jazz, etc.?  Whether you can hang with these tracks or not, it's hard not to admire the sheer audacity of it all, but that doesn't mean you'll want to listen to every song whenever you put on this CD.  But despite the presence of material you might never want to hear again, the good stuff on this album is too great to ignore.  I've found that an 80-minute CD is enough to hold all the real winners on this album, plus enough of the better oddities (not every experiment is a failure) to preserve the flavor of the complete work.<br />Now more than ever, we mustn't forget that there's a whole world of people suffering out there, and what diminishes them diminishes us, because we're all living in the same global village.  This multifarious work of musical art is a powerful reminder of their plight.  And ours.nto dub, Irish folk music, calypso, the minuet, cocktail jazz, etc.?

B0001NBMBC|1.0|I used to love slipknot But after this cd came out i lost all respect. I mean theres so much better bands to listen to like 18 VISIONS.. ATREYU.. THROWDOWN..AS I LAY DIEING..slipknot is for people who dont know where tha good metal is at..But i still love Slipknots first album...R.I.P. Slipknot
B0001NBMBC|4.0|I have to admit that I always thought SLipknot was a gimmick band who screamed out lyrics that made no sense to fast and hard speed metal.  With this album they have definitely changed my perception.  From start to finish this album both rocks and flows.  The lyrics actually make sense and flow well with their metal sound.  They have grown as far as being musicians and we can only hope for even more in the future.  So if you have never been a fan of Slipknot, now may be the time to start.  This album is well worth the cash.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Avril Lavigne's &quot;Under My Skin&quot; has more rock songs than her first album, &quot;Let Go&quot;, and the song, &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; is one of the best songs to be released as a single to ever hit the airwaves and on TV for a music video! Each and every song on this album is sung with emotion and I like how she sings them! She writes and sings what she wants and this album really shows that! <br />(01) &quot;Take Me Away&quot;- The first song to start off this album and it's also a short song, too, but heck, who cares?!<br />(02) &quot;Together&quot;- A song that most people can relate to in their own way, and for me, I can definitely relate to that song. <br />(03) &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot;- The first single, and a song that's perfect to be on this album of &quot;Under My Skin&quot;!<br />(04) &quot;He Wasn't&quot;- A good rock song with good rock taste.<br />(05) &quot;How Does It Feel&quot;- One of my favorite songs on this album, and I just can't get this song out of my head! LOL!<br />(06) &quot;My Happy Ending&quot;- Another song that most people can relate to, and also a song that I can relate to, myself.<br />(07) &quot;Nobody's Home&quot;- A good song with a good story in it.<br />(08) &quot;Forgotten&quot;- This song rocks!<br />(09) &quot;Who Knows&quot;- I heard parts of this song, but I bet it's good.<br />(10) &quot;Fall To Pieces&quot;- Love it.<br />(11) &quot;Freak Out&quot;- Cool song!<br />(12) &quot;Slipped Away&quot;- Now this song is a good song to end the CD, but the one thing is that it's sad and I can definitely relate to this one because it's about Avril singing about the death of her grandfather, and since my grandfather died, this song is what made me realize how sad it was for me to see my grandfather slip away from my life like this. <br />Overall, this album absolutely brilliant! Go Avril!
B00000JKH2|5.0|Whoa. This is a great great great great great EP from a great great great great great band. i was reading the former reviews and one idiot said that ATDI was ripping off A New Found Glory. what is he smoking. NFG is a terrible fake punk/pop band with the most annoying singer in the world and no musical talent what so ever. this is about the complete opposite of ATDI. This music is the work of god. I love the guitar players and the drummer is great not to mention cedric's great singing style and amazing (but strange) lyrics. I dont no how the do it but they do it well. A great cd, worth the buy click the button and get out your credit card.
B000092ZYX|1.0|I recently returned from a trip to London where I saw this CD in so many used bins I thought it was a mistake. Apparently Radiohead's dated and whiny pseudo-political message wore thin mighty quickly over in the UK, and it's done the same here. Political albums are boring, trite, heavy-handed, doctrinaire, and simplistic. Every song on this album is political in nature, featuring a band that plays its laptops pretty average while the whiniest, most morose vocalist of the 20th century croons like Gene Pitney on thorazine, whining about political crises in another country as if Justin Timberlake decided to take on the Sierra Leone civil war in a rock concept album. Bland, uninspired, force-fed and critically overrated like no other &quot;band&quot; I've heard.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I would give this album 50 zillion stars if there was an option. Avril has grown so much since her 1st album. The songs on UMS are so lyrically and musically awesome. Chantal Kreviazuk, Ben Moody, Evan Taubenfeld, and all the others Avril worked with made this album so great. They all have so much talent and if you read the lyrics it shows. My friend described this album as &quot;the best break-up cd&quot; and I agree. All the anger and pain guys cause us girls comes across so well in Avril's songs. &quot;Slipped Away&quot; is so heart-felt and touching it made me cry when I heard it. This album deserves it #1 spot on the Billboard Chart. Get ready world: Avril's back!!
B000268QB2|1.0|I am so thankful that Keane exist. That means that those few times I venture to the mall and try on clothing in The Gap and Banana Republic, and my wife does the same in The Limited, we will have something besides &quot;Clocks&quot; by Coldplay to listen to. That one was getting a little rough. You see, Keane is the Interzone Records answer to Coldplay and (by default) Radiohead-lite, endlessly unchallenging fluff for people who want to fit into their clothing and model it in the mirror at the mall without having to think about global warming or the Iraq war. Nice idea, (probably) nice guys, but bland music for bland Starbuck's America. Key indicator: people are praising Keane as &quot;the best thing since _____&quot; (fill in blank with last year's band-of-the-moment). That doesn't bode well for Keane. Naturally, however, they will make alot of money with their prom music, tour the United States' fine collection of college gyms, support someone huge on a tour where everyone will recognize their &quot;hit&quot; from the clothing experience, and suffer defeat when the used bins of America are clogged with their album after about a year of steady but uneventful unit shifting. Welcome to the big time, boys.
006109594X|3.0|Very well written and Mr. Robinson gave a great account of submarine tactics and warfare.  However, there were no surprises throughout the book and the ending was rather predictable.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|This album, although very different from her first, shows Avril's creative side. It is captivating, and makes you want to listen to it over and over again. It's one of my favorite albums that I own, and I recommend it to anyone who loves to listen to solid, heartfelt lyrics along with music that will make you really appreciate what you're hearing.
B0001IN0DA|5.0|WMXX was the most hyped Wrestlemania event in years, and it lived up to all the expectation. The DVD is great, featuring the best documentary I've ever seen, &quot;The Mania of Wrestlemania&quot;, and the &quot;Wrestlemania's 10 Greatest Matches&quot; hosted by Ric Flair. On to the event itself:<br />1. John Cena vs. Big Show (c) for the U.S. Title<br />Great way to kick of Wrestlemania. Cena, who had been a worthy title-holder for quite some time, finally gets his chance here. Big Show gets in most of the offense, and Cena finally defeats Big Show after hitting 2 FU's (with the help of some brass knucks). 7.5/10<br />2. RVD/Booker T(c) vs. La Resistance vs. The Dudleys vs. Garrison Cade/Mark Jindrak for the World Tag Titles<br />Pretty good tag match, despite the fact that RVD and Booker T were a very unusual team to be tag champs. It was fast-paced except for when Rob Conway was in and kept doing boring submission manuevers. Finish sees RVD pinning Conway via the 5-Star Frog Splash.  7/10<br />3. Chris Jericho vs. Christian<br />This match nearly rivaled Michaels vs. Jericho from the previous Wrestlemania. There was never a dull moment in this match, and Christian really showed how talented he is. Both men went all out, and the ending was very unexpected, as Christian rolls up Jericho following interference by Trish. 9/10<br />4. Rock n' Sock vs. Evolution<br />This was a really good tag match. Evolution, which is a great stable, put on their best match yet against The Rock and Mick Foley. It was great to see Rock and Foley in action again. Flair was entertaining as usual and Orton really became a major star after this one. The finish saw Orton delivering an RKO out of nowhere on Mick Foley.  8.5/10<br />5. Evening Gown Match- Jackie and Stacy vs. Sable and Trish<br />Not a very good match, used strictly to please the male fans. I'm a male fan and I didn't really care for this one too much. Worst match of the evening.  3/10<br />6. Cruiserweight Open<br />This wasa sweet cruiserweight match, where all of the CWs got to display their talents on the grand stage. Billy Kidman hit a sick shooting star press on the outside, and Rey Mysterio was flying all over the place as usual. Finish sees Chavo Sr. helping Chavo get the pin on Mysterio.  8.5/10<br />7. Goldberg vs. Brock Lesnar with Stone Cold as referee<br />It was disappointing, but not completely horrible. I expected much better out of Lesnar. He goes from beating Kurt Angle in an amazing technical match to this. A very unnecessary slow start, but once they got going there were some pretty cool moments. Goldberg wins with a jackhammer, and he and Lesnar both receive stunners. 6/10<br />8. Scotty and Riskisi (c) vs. Bashams vs. TWGTT vs. The APA<br />Not quite as good as RAW's tag match, but still a good match. TWGTT put on the best performance in this match. In the end, Rikishi crushed Doug Basham for the pin after a Clothesline from Hell from Bradshaw.  7/10<br />9. Molly Holly vs. Victoria (c)<br />I'm not a big fan of women's wrestling at all, and this match really was no exception. Lackluster match with a rollup finish, and Molly getting her head shaved afterwards really wasn't all that great either.  5/10<br />10. Kurt Angle vs. Eddie Guerrero (c) for WWE Title<br />I expected a good match, but I was shocked by this one. This match was AWESOME. Kurt wrestled a flawless match, and I was very impressed with Guerrero's use of technical moves. I was so impressed with Angle though that I was hoping he would win the match. In the end, Guerrero unties his boot, and it slips off as Angle goes for the ankle lock. Guerrero then uses a small package for the win.   10/10<br />11. Undertaker vs. Kane<br />The most hyped match of the night. Unlike a lot of people, I thought Taker's return was better than expected. I got the chills when he came out. Most people say Kane got no offense in, but they must have not been paying attention to the match. Kane got in as much, if not MORE offense in than Taker, it just had little effect. Taker finishes him off with the Tombstone.<BR>10/10...for the best return in WWE history.<br />12. Triple H (c) vs. Chris Benoit vs. HBK- World Heavyweight Championship<br />Chris Benoit has been my favorite wrestler since I started watching wrestling. And now here he was, he had made it into the main event at Wrestlemania. 3 of the best of all time in the ring at the same time. This was truly a dream match. Every man gave it everything they had, and put on the most spectacular match I've ever seen. The finish came as the mighty Triple H tapped out to the crossface. Afterwards, Guerrero came out and congratulated Benoit, and the two men hugged. I admit it, that made me cry.   10/10
B00005JMCN|5.0|This tale of a down-on-his-luck horse and his down-on-his-luck jockey was one of the most moving films of 2003.<br />I had been somewhat biased against seeing this movie due to the less than stellar marketing - namely TV spots that mostly showed Tobey Maguire in his whinier moments. Eventually, however, I decided that all the positive comments that this film had recieved warrented that I go see it.<br />I was completely blown away. The film managed to make you completely sympathetic to Seabiscuit as a character without all the cheesy ploys a lesser director would have used to try to humanize the horse.<br />Chris Cooper as the eccentric but brilliant trainer, Tom Smith, proves yet again his prowess as an actor, previously seen in his role in American Beauty.<br />Jeff Bridges as Charles Howard is funny, in mourning, strong, and hurt, all at the same time.<br />And, despite my comments earlier about the whiny moments that are featured in the television commercials, Tobey Maguire as Red Pollard is brilliant. He displays a wonderful combination of tough, yet vulnerable that would seem cliched on a lesser actor. And if it's possible for an actor to have chemistry with a horse, Maguire displayed that with the horse playing Seabiscuit in this film.<br />The context in which the main drama of the film itself is placed is as much a part of the story as all the races that are shown. Depictions of the Great Depression, from ones made especially for this film to archival footage that is used, add greatly to the film. And the scene in which you see various households around the country listening to the race on their radios, rather than seeing most of the race istself, is one of the most memorable sequences in the film.<br />Of course, the races manage to be completely compelling and suspenseful, despite the fact that, since this is history, you already know the outcome.<br />This film was amazing, and if it had been produced in a year that wasn't dominated by the third installment of the Lord of the Rings, it would have been a serious contender for many Oscars.allment of the Lord of the Rings, it would have been a serious contender for many Oscars.
0671027387|1.0|\\"Deception Point,\\" Dan Brown's third novel, is about the truth, falsity, and political consequences of a NASA claim to have discovered a historic meteorite embedded in ice for more than three centuries.<br />The intrigue that ensues is an enormous disappointment and less than thrilling after reading \\"Angels and Demons,\\" \\"Digital Fortress,\\" and \\"The D'Vinci Code.\\"The novel takes 150 pages of mindless digressions before the first \\"event\\" occurs, and even then it is a minor event in the scope of things. Another 200 pages of wandering digressions and ruminations follow before the novel picks up steam for the final 200 pages. Even when the tension begins to mount toward the end, Brown is given to endless digression after digression, making the novel lose its steam time and again.<br />There were numerous occasions where I almost gave up reading, dreading another arcane lesson in Brown's extensive armamentaria of knowledge (e.g., the size, dimension, manufacturer, nation of origin, purpose, use - both licit and illicit - of aircraft, streets, memorials, geodesic domes, ice picks, chronometers, boats, ad nauseam). But the worst part came when the incredulous finale arrives -- an ending only God could have crafted in the derision of humankind.<br />The book is not recommended. Brown's other three novels, however, are..
0618526412|5.0|I am a little more than half way through and think this book is amazing so far.  I was disapointed in some of the reviews I saw.<BR>This book is very thought provoking.  They way it is writen is just amazing.  It makes you think about all the unjust things out in the world. It was written in 1940, and back then this book must have caused a lot of controvery because of all the issues that were addressed in it such as racism, the way the government is run/communism, lonelyness, and what it is like to be deaf in a world that doesn't seem to tolerant of differences.  The book is writen in a way that doesn't just let you know how the characters are feeling but it lets you feel too.  I totally recomend this book to anyone.
0743243307|2.0|This books had many starts and stops. Unfortunately, there are too many stops.  Just as the book started to get interesting, the reader is lead back down into dismal descriptions of a dirty apartment, drug use and all-around hopelessness. I, luckily, borrowed this book from the library just I didn't feel as I wasted my money. I think the book would have been so much more interesting if it had been written with the sister's view and her story, albeit a little more realistic. However, this book was too long, boring and depressing.
B0000C9JFO|5.0|I think I saw this movie two years ago. I enjoyed it, and I wished that I was present in the stage, when they were shooting it. The movie, featuring a bunch of students of different nationalities living in the same apartment, presents you the life in Barcelona, the relationships between these people and more.<br />A commentary I read about this movie on the newspapers was that, the movie promoted the life in European Union, and being European and having the chance to live the life better. Perhaps, this is because I'm living in Turkey, and Turkey isn't admitted to European Union yet. But even so, it's still nice. <br />Audrey Tatou will attract many people to watch this movie. However, don't limit your expectations to her only, because her part is quite short. The female audience, on the other hand, might enjoy watching the main character, who has the most modest expression. Good for watching with a bunch of people; will please everyone.

B00005V3Z4|5.0|In a world of chick flicks, plotless action movies, and comedies lacking depth, Donnie Darko is the savior.  I've done everything I can to spread the word of this great movie... nearly everyone I meet I recommend this to.<br />The movie isn't a horror film in any way at all, nor is it creepy (or at least I didn't think so).  It is simply brilliant Science Fiction.  Don't get me wrong, though... it's not boring like many science fiction movies.<br />It is hard to describe the plot without making the movie sound moronic or giving away too much, so I will not try.  All I can say about it is that if you love yourself, go see this movie.
B000084T18|1.0|Stay away from this crap, you are wasting your money.  this is NOT rap.  i cant believe what rap has turned into these days.  this album is pure bubble gum rap.  50 cent is an absolute joke dont support him by buying this album
6305313687|5.0|This isn't your average anti-racism movie.  Sure, it's possibly the best one ever, but it's not average by any means.<br />Our story is told from a racist family, which is the first twist.  There are many different ways that they told the story, all of which are refreshingly original.  The movie has a very powerful message, and even I found myself on the verge of tears at the end.<br />So go down and buy this movie, some popcorn, and maybe a tissue box.  You'll have a great time.

078401213X|5.0|I was amazed when I saw this movie.  But I wasn't amazed at special effects, nor was I amazed at an all-star cast.  This movie didn't need any of that.  This movie is, in short, awesome.<br />Throughout the movie you enter the chaotic world that is the mind of Max Cohen.  The chaos grows increasingly intense both visually and mentally.  The many metaphors allow the movie to play with your brain, and tell a story at the same time.  If the thought of a movie made about a mathematician walking the line between sanity and insanity searching for an answer to a seemingly unsolvable problem doesn't interest you, maybe the genius ending will.  I beg of you to go see this movie today.  You'll thank yourself.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I bought this album the day it came out.  It is by far the best buy I've made this summer.  Avril really opens up in this album, her music has really matured since her first album &quot;Let Go&quot; I recommend everyone go to your local music store and check out Avril Lavigne &quot;Under My Skin&quot; It's great!!!
B00008OLYN|4.0|I've always liked Opeth, ever since I heard of them.  All of their albums that I own are excellent.  I especially enjoyed the melodic and light tracks that were included in at least one song from each CD.<br />When I first heard of a CD by Opeth that was all light music, I was hesitant to buy it.  After listening to a few tracks, I decided it was an excellent album!  Some tracks are repetitive, but all around this is one of Opeth's greatest.  Sure, they could have hired the lyrical depth on a majority of the CD, but I was still pleased with it.  I highly recommend this to anyone, Opeth fan or not.
0780020685|2.0|I finally saw this film after hearing so much about it. It was good, but it's not THE greatest film of all. The editing seems sloppy at times, the action sequences are OK, and the audio is very bare. But then again it was made in 1954. The characters are definitely captivitating and the story is good but this is a bad transfer of a highly acclaimed film. Criterion prides itself for it's superior quality DVDs, but this transfer was poorly done. The film is drenched with scratches, black spots, dirt, burn marks and an annoying light flickering. For the price I paid, I expected a pristine copy. This Criterion is NOT worth buying. Save your $40+ tax and rent it (although I hear Criterion might redo this DVD) Two stars for the crappy transfer.
B000003CKH|5.0|This is my favorite Cake album.  Yes, I've tried them all.  =P<br />Fashion Nugget never goes stale.
B00000DC10|5.0|I really lucked out finding out about this band by chance. I saw the &quot;New Noise&quot; video on late night tv, and it blew me away. This bands willingness to try new things and do it their own way blew me away, and as I learned from their last cd, their technical ability with their instruments and their ability to write sprawling songs with incredible lyrics amazes me. Its no wonder that they decided to break up after this, saying that they finally accomplished what they set out to do (but it is a shame).<br />If you like hardcore punk, but consider yourself a fan of music as a whole, pick this cd up immediately. Its incredible, and will always have a place on my top five, perhaps my top three (I am never able to pick one single favorite cd, or else it might be there).
B00001NFCY|1.0|It's a small but welcome victory for honest music that these corporate Pearl Jam-wannabe poseurs broke up. <br />One down -- about 1,852 to go.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|i am a big avril fan and i love this album. she has grown up alot and it shows in her music. i think that she is great!
B00018D44U|4.0|This isn't a perfect album, but it is a very strong, solid CD that I am certain I will always have in my collection if only because it effectively prevents road rage. And it's great that a top selling musical artist is basing their career on music and songs for a change, and not concerning themselves with dancing, big beats, or cheap gimmicks. And the band is a musician's band - creative and competent.<br />Reading the reviews here to this album is interesting to say the least. <br />If you wade through the criticisms, a few things keep coming back:<br />- &quot;I expected more from this album since the last one won all these awards.&quot;<br />- &quot;I got this album foisted on me by my friends and I'm sick to death of it.&quot;<br />- &quot;This isn't 50 years ago. Why is she making a boring album that sounds like it belongs in the '40's?&quot;<br />There are a few things I can say about this album. It has actual songs on it. There's no posturing. If you listen to the instruments, they jam together without beating the listener into submission. They have room to breathe and stay fluid. The songs are tuneful, the band is solid, they make things very interesting, and Norah's singing is luxurious if understated. The only reason I can come up with so many listeners missing these simple truths is the fact that the overall volume level is very low. It is strongly held together by a good song selection (including one from the legendary Townes Van Zandt) which will not become dated. This is a band who can communicate like a Blue Note band and not beat people over the head with it. This is the sound of confidence - which sorely lacks in most hit releases of 2004.<br />Many &quot;songs&quot; by today's hitmakers can't be reproduced live without a backing tape. Norah's band of course has no such problem making the music come alive onstage, and it will even change like you would expect of any good jazz or jam band. They've got ears and they're not afraid to use them. Thankfully. Music that makes you happy and relaxed - what a concept.<br />For those of you who think this is boring and no one with any kind of musical diversity could love this - you are missing out.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|...IGNORANT OR TOO STUPID TO APPRECIATE IT.  Its heavy, its powerful, its funky, its energetic.  It will have you jumping around your house and screaming the lyrics in the shower.  It takes you on a rollercoaster of thumping beats, driving riffs, acrobatic guitar effects and hard hitting vocals.  All four members are individually brilliant but still compliment eachother perfectly.    <BR>   It annoys me that not everybody has given it 5 out of 5, becuase it really is one of the strongest albums you will ever hear.  For me, its the best album ever made.
0736041850|4.0|The artwork in this book is very impressive. It attests to the incredible patience and dedication of its author.  The book shows almost all working muscles and helps you (if you are familiar with muscle anatomy) to figure ways to discern your points of weakness and strength.  Thus, it is most beneficial to people who studied anatomy yet need a reminder to evaluate their exercise selection.<br />I saw the book in the gym once, which surprised me because it is not a training book.  It does not tell you how to choose a sequence of exercises on a particular day or for a particular goal.  You would not need to carry the book to the gym to remember the steps of execution of an exercise. The best usage for the book is enhancing you guessing of hitting a particular muscle with a specific exercise.<br />The exercise list in this book in not inclusive or perfect and only depicts what the author perceives as common. For example, the book does not tell you whether to choose machines or freestyle exercises, nor does it tell you how to perform a compound exercise that eliminates many unnecessary separate and partial exercises.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Hi! I bought Avril's new album &quot;under my skin&quot; and I love it!!!<BR>I can say it's a lot better than the first one.<BR>This is the best album I ever bought.

B000053V7Q|1.0|This is a Turner Entertainmnet/AOL/Time/Warner film. It is NOT the MGM film. Turner has destroyed my memory of the original film. There's lots missing, nothing has been added except a (for the most part) horrible sounding soundtrack. A travesty. Stick with the old MGM VHS.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|Well, I'm listening to Subliminal Verses as I type, and I don't really object to their new sound, but I wouldn't go as far as to say that I especially like it.  Based on what I've heard, I'd have to say that Vermillion demonstates what most maggots are familiar with...it serves as a kind of eerie reminder of &quot;Prosthetics&quot;.  I agree with one of the earlier reviews of this album: Where the Hell did the cursing go???  Not to sound too juvenile, but Taylor's screaming of obscenities was a key element that made the band what we grew to love.  Also, while the acoustic tracks were indeed very, very good...it just isn't them.  Taylor has a terrific voice when he wants to, but when it's coupled with acoustic, mellow beats, he comes off sounding vaguely of Justin Timberlake (not to come off offensive). <br />In any case, I burned the album from a friend, and I would have to recommend others to do the same (unless you're such a rampant fan that you absolutely must have the artwork too).  Not their greatest work, but still worth being familiar with.
B00004RFFI|2.0|The one-dimensional characters were out of a cartoon book.  What a disappointment! You would think that with Helen Hunt, there could be some character depth.  But the &quot;B&quot; team was out in spades in this stinker - even the guy whose dad owned the expensive car in &quot;Ferris Buehler's Day Off&quot; was given a speaking part.  And with Bill Paxon - well, you just know there's going to be a lot of hurt and angry looks, and a lot of running around, and no character development.  And Cary Elwes of &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; showed up as the &quot;Bad Guy.&quot;  Someone came across these guys waiting tables and took pity on them.  But at our expense.  Shame!  Next time give us some real actors with a real plot.
B000002LND|2.0|I had high expectations for this album when it first came out.  Lo and behold, about every song on here is a remix.  What I really expect from a Greatest Hits album is for the hits to sound just like the original.  About every other song on here &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Like A Prayer&quot;, or &quot;Express Yourself&quot; is a remix.  If you want the originals, get the originals---unless you want a change of pace.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|I bought this thinking it would be like her first cd, you know all catchy and enthusiastic. But it isn't it kinda channels Evanescence only it isn't nearly as good. It is good though and I like it very much, I could listen to the whole thing without running and changing any of the songs. The best tracks in my opinion would have to be Take me away, Together, Don't tell me, My happy ending, and Nobody's home. The rest I couldn't really remember after the cd was over
B0001UL7RY|1.0|Avril Levigne is nothing but an ugly bee-atch who can't sing worth a crap!!! I saw her video on MTV about a month or so ago, and I had no clue why she was so p-oed at everyone??? Even the other day I was in Sam Goody browsing around and the sales associate hated her guts so badly that he started scribbling all over Avril's publicity picture.  <br />Avril, you and Michelle Branch need to join the Alanis wannabes club. <br />Don't even think about buying this garbage!!!!!
B0001KZM3O|5.0|great floyd, what can I say. the instruments come in at the right time to emphasize the lyrics in that particular place. roger Waters is a genius.
B00004TH83|5.0|Lara Fabian is beautiful and she's got such an amazing voice!! I don't know if she'll ever be the next Celine Dion, but MAN, this lady can sing!!!! <br />No, I don't even have any of her albums.  But I have to say I like her song &quot;I Will Love Again&quot;.  Even radio critics nationwide were amazed with her voice!!! <br />Also I liked her duet with Josh Groban titled &quot;For Always&quot; from the Artificial Intelligence soundtrack.  Josh and Lara blend just perfectly together!!! <br />I can't think of anything better to write than this!!! I hope to hear more of Lara in the future!!!
B00020HEG6|5.0|Having seen this marvelous film now, one can be even more enthusiastic about Williams' score. Like many who have written here, there was a marked feeling of letdown in Chamber of Secrets, so the waterfall of new, varied, and deeply felt music that comes with this film is welcomed. By the way, anyone wondering whether to see this film is encouraged to go: Cuaron's work is among the best there is in film today, and his evocative, dramatic direction clearly inspired Williams. As to the music, it's every bit as breathtaking as some of Cuaron's shots. The Buckbeak music (especially while watching the magnificent flight scene over the lake) is sublime, and the juxtaposition of period-instrument pre-Baroque, Cantina jazz, and that Prokofiev-style orchestration of Williams is deeply nourishing (does the snowball fight scene remind anyone else of the Classical Symphony?).<br />For Potter fans and simply lovers of art, this music and its film are both unreservedly recommended. They are exemplary of how artistic inspiration comes from the formless realm of consciousness and penetrates through a multiplicity of people and their artistic media--starting with Mrs. Rowling's writing and working through to Cuaron, Williams, and the splendid cast of this film. It all began, about 15 years ago, on a simple train ride from Manchester to London.
B00003CXSM|4.0|well I loved this movie, its funny, its just great! We all know already what is it about. But what I want to say is that is wrong to compare this movie to Maid In Manhattan! Its way better and even a non JLO fan will love it, if he likes comedies, this is the kind of movie that makes you feel 'easy' and enjoy your time! I defenetly recommend it! ;)
0441172717|4.0|It's true what they say about Dune - it is to science fiction what LotR is to fantasy, and for good reason. I won't go much into what the novel is about, but I found it a very interesting read. This novel is essentially about survival and politics. I guess Herbert was also interested in conveying the importance of our planets resources but that's a background issue. It gets 4 stars for its depth, vision and execution - but I did find it difficult to get through and sometimes frustrating. I've read another review saying it's for all ages but I would have to disagree, as it is sometimes not only hard to follow, but can be tedious for those of us who have shorter attention spans. Regardless, it's a great novel and my favourite part about it was the commentary inbetween chapters which was insightful and elevated the novel to a higher plane.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|Avril should really go into a ditch and just stay there.  She comes across all tuff and &quot;bad ass&quot; but really she jusr does what the record execs tell her to do. IF Brody of the Distillers and Avril were to fight.  Brody would take avril down in a second.  No doubt about it.  And she has no lyrical talents.
B00005JMX4|5.0|I liked it alot.  In a roundabout way it's like the soul-sucessor of Risky Business, amalgamed with A Walk to Remember.  Yes the plot is old and recyled but the reason a storyline like this one is used and used up is because sometimes all the pieces fall right and you get magic.  This is one of thoes times.  The performances are good all around, the soundtrack does just what a soundtrack should, compliments the movie beautifully.  There's genuine romance, and emotion(the characters were so fleshed out I found myself thinking about what I'd do in the main characters shoes), there's parts of taingable danger(a kick movies like this have been screaming for sence they were first contrived) and for a while the movie feels like it's veering towards tragety just untill the happy ending I wound up rooting for.  Casting was inspired putting Elisha Cuthbert in the role that's every teenage guy's wetdream come true.  It's one of thoes movies I don't even need to see twice before I know I'm going to buy it as soon as it comes out.  On a budget like mine that's the best compliment it can get.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|Avril is a poser and she is not real punk.  She is a girl with leather wristbands and spikes who acts out.  But we have all seen or atleast heard of the things Sid Vicious did and he blows her right outta the ballpark.  Avril &quot;wishes&quot; she was like Sid, but the nore she tries the more we all dont like her.
B00005A46T|5.0|Usually when bands make a second album, its not as good as their first. Well, Slipknot is an exception. Every song is great. Songs to look forward to are &quot;People=S**t&quot; &quot;My Plague&quot; &quot;Left Behind&quot; &quot;The Heretic Anthem&quot; &quot;Disasterpieces&quot; which pop up in my head the most. SO BUY IT!!
B00009L1UP|5.0|This is one of those albums that you simply just must have.  It's a classic album of great songs now with three added good bonus tracks, and re-mastered so it has even more punch.<br />Following on the heels of the ambitious concept album &quot;Operation Mindcrime&quot; their best album to date, Queensryche (argueably) delivered the album of their career with &quot;Empire&quot; in 1990.  Always at the forefront of metal innovation and experimentation, never content to rest on their laurels, always keen to push the envelope, they delivered an album which was less complex than Mindcrime, but packed full of great songs which were just as intense.<br />This album has so many great classic QR songs such as &quot;Jet City Woman&quot;, &quot;Another Rainy Night&quot;, &quot;Empire&quot;, and &quot;Silent Lucidity&quot;, but also &quot;Best I Can&quot;, &quot;The Thin Line&quot;, &quot;Hand On Heart&quot; and &quot;Anybody Listening?&quot; rank among their best ever.<br />Of the bonus tracks &quot;Last Time In Paris&quot; and &quot;Dirty Lil Secret&quot; rock, but my favorite is the more psychedelic sounding &quot;Scarborough Fair&quot;.<br />In summary, this is a great classic metal album which still stands the test of time and frequently vibrates the windows of my house.  Now re-released in this fantastic re-mastered package, it should be in every true metal fan's collection.
B0001MDPVS|5.0|This cd is the best ever. If you are a rap fan this is a must-have!
B000001ELL|4.0|KISS' 7th studio album (excluding the studio side of Alive II), 1979's Dynasty, has some important &quot;firsts&quot; in KISStory.  It was the first album to not feature all members of the band on the entire recording (Peter Criss only worked on &quot;Dirty Livin&quot;).  At the time, unknown to the public, Criss was on his way out of the band and had also just been in a car accident that prevented him from performing.  Whether or not Criss walked out or was asked to leave is not totally clear although several statements say he was &quot;bought out&quot;.  Also unknown to fans at the time, the remaining 8 tracks featured David Letterman drummer Anton Fig who had just worked on Ace Frehley's solo album.  Later more &quot;shocking&quot; news came out that Gene Simmons only played bass on his two songs while Paul played bass and guitar on his compositions as did Ace.  It makes one wonder how often they all saw each other for the recording sessions!  It also brings up another question: how long has this been going on?  Later on, similiar news in fan circles started coming out about earlier albums like that Ace only played on &quot;Rocket Ride&quot; on the studio side of Alive II and the rest was done by Bruce Kulick's brother, Bob.  This might count as the first time an original member didn't play, but another fact that came out in interviews was that Ace didn't play the solo on Destroyer's &quot;Sweet Pain&quot;.  How much this really matters is up to the individual. Then again, no disrespect to Gene, but would you know if it was or wasn't him playing bass on those songs?<br />Dynasty also marks the first time KISS worked with producer/co-writer Vini Poncia who was fresh from producing Criss' solo album and would go onto produce the follow-up KISS Unmasked.  It's definitely under the direction (some say misdirection!) of Poncia that the KISS sound started to become more polished and radio friendly, but that doesn't mean there aren't some strong tracks here.  &quot;I was made for loving you&quot; was a big crossover disco hit for KISS and &quot;Sure know something&quot; might as well have been.  There are also 3 vocal appearances (2 penned) by Ace Frehley on one album: &quot;Hard Times&quot;, &quot;Save Your Love&quot;, and a rocking version of the Stones' &quot;2000 Man&quot;, perfect for Ace (Previously Ace had only sang on Love Gun's &quot;Shock Me&quot; and Alive II's &quot;Rocket Ride&quot;).  Frehley's solo album sold the best out of the four KISS members and it's obvious as to why that is.  It's the most consistent and strongest in terms of the KISS style up to that point.  It made all the sense for him to contribute more to the albums.  Some other great riffs in tracks like Simmons' &quot;Charisma&quot; and Stanley's &quot;Magic Touch&quot; and you have a pretty solid album.<br />Dynasty came hot on the heels of another KISS first (actually a music first!).  A year earlier, all four members each did a solo album, which were released on the same date.  Add to this a popular television movie &quot;KISS meets the Phantom of the Park&quot; and merchandise up the wa-zoo and there's going to be some ego increase.  Surely Ace, Gene, Paul, and Peter returned to the studio with even bigger heads than before and wanted to do their own thing.  The problem was they were all members of KISS!  Ace Frehley would work on two more albums following Dynasty, 1980's Unmasked and 81's Music from the Elder (even though he was on the album covers up to Creatures of the Night).  Peter Criss was officially out of the band before Unmasked was recorded where he was temporarily replaced, as he is on Dynasty, by Anton Fig.  Music from the Elder would mark the first appearance of drummer Eric Carr, the Fox.<br />Dynasty only gets underrated when compared to classic albums such as Destroyer or Love Gun.  For many fans, the change in style and experimentation was too much.  However it did happen to be the last KISS album in a succession starting with 1976's Destroyer to reach over platinum sales.  It also features KISS' second gold single, &quot;I was made for loving you&quot; (the first being &quot;Beth&quot;).  In my opinon, all of the make-up albums from &quot;KISS&quot; to &quot;Creatures&quot; are classics.  Even though the original line-up was starting to break up here, Dynasty is still a worthy addition to your collection, especially if you're a KISS fan, in which case it's essential.  I'm also partial to my giant Dynasty wall poster.  Just thought I'd throw that in.1976's Destroyer to reach over platinum sales.

B0000AI45P|5.0|If aliens started a rock band they would probably sound a hell of a lot like Television. This album just simply blows my mind I dont think I can elaborate on that anymore. &quot;See No Evil&quot; &quot;Venus&quot; and &quot;Friction&quot; are worth the price alone but then they put the mind boggling ten minute &quot;Marquee Moon&quot; on there. Its one of those rare long songs that doesn't have one unnessecary note in it. After unleashing an unbelievable first half upon the listener its really all their's to screw up at this point, but to my surprise the second half of the album is just as good as the first. &quot;Elevation&quot; &quot;Prove It&quot; &quot;Torn Curtain&quot; are all classics as far as Im concerned. In fact the only song on this album that I don't love intensly is &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, which still isnt bad it just goes on a little to long. In my opinion Marquee Moon by Television is one of the greatest albums in rock history.
0679428895|4.0|The book is short, concise, fast paced and, as we all know, has a heck of a climax. The characters are worth caring about. I seem to find what I like most about the story is the different angle it takes when it comes to a central character. Almost all historical fiction books set during the Roman era either pertain to the upper crust of emperors, generals and senators, or the lowest of the low slaves and gladiators. Here the hero is a good old-fashioned working stiff, someone I could identify with.
B000003TA4|1.0|Nirvana is The Worst Band Ever. Even Worse than Creed. They Just Suck. What is smells like Teen spirit about anyway? Lithium-WTF. Polly- What is he doing, raping a bird??? This is the wort album ever and the worst band ever. I'm glad kurt killed himself.
B000089CJI|2.0|I've got that CD because I read good reviews about it. But I'm really disapointed. This album is very repetiive and brings nothing new to the music panorama. All the CD is a continuation of New Order's or Pet shop boys music and doesn't introduce anything new to that kind of music. With this CD Pstal Service shows little imagination and just follows the road opened by others before.<br />The tracks are very similar, there aren't too much changes between them. Looks if they used a template to perform the music.<br />The recording is also poor, in a good stereo system the music lacks presence and everything sounds the same. The drums have the same size as as a guitar and in the reallity that dosen't happen.
B00006EXL5|5.0|I thought that I would hate this album... I didn't consider myself a big fan of scream-o emo. But my friend insisted, so I gave it a listen, and I am so glad that I did. This is one of my favorite albums of all time. The songs are so raw and personal, it feels like they're being sung to you and only you. Standout tracks are: &quot;Drowning Lessons&quot;, &quot;This Is The Best Day Ever&quot;, and &quot;Cubicles&quot;. These songs are some of the most intense musical experiences I've ever had. Highly, highly recommended.
B00004Z400|5.0|&quot;White Pony&quot; is the first 'Tones disc from which I heard any of their stuff.  <br />I heard &quot;Change&quot; on the radio and liked it.  So I decided to download Digital Bath and I was blown away! Upon hearing that track I decided I had to have White Pony.  My favorites are Digital Bath, Knife Party and Passenger.  I've very glad they brought in Maynard from Tool(another of my favorite bands) to do vocals; he and Chino sound awesome.  <br />White Pony is more mellow than Adrenaline, maintaining a balance between mosh-worthy rock riffs and beautifully haunting melody.  <br />It's great that Deftones won a grammy for &quot;Elite,&quot; though I would have gone with Passenger or Knife Party for the award. <br />There's not a bad song on this CD. It makes a great first Deftones CD, provided you don't care about chronological release.
B00004Y87J|3.0|I found the ending to this film to be disappointing, I might even say lame or contrived, and that ruined my enjoyment of most of the movie. I strongly recommend the 1978 remake with William Powell, John Mills, and David Warner. This is one of those rare times when a remake was better than the original, and that's even rarer when the original was a Hitchcock film. The climax in this one is action-filled, and will appeal to any fan of mystery/suspense/action classics. I give the '78 remake 5 stars. I've been unable to find the 1978 version here in the US, maybe because it was a British production, but I just visited Amazon in the UK, and it is available there. Just remember , if you're buying a foreign DVD, verify that it will play in Region 1 (US &amp; Canada).
B0001UL7RY|1.0|i love let go....but not this album<BR>her vocal is extremely WEAK<BR>especically in the first 2 tracks<BR>i regret that i made a decision on buying this album
B00028HBKM|2.0|Not much to see here, it is frankly close to unwatchable.<br />The decision to use the native language of the time was an excellent one, however, and adds some authenticity to the film that is fresh and new.<br />The sheer uniqueness of the movie makes it worth a look, but it is not entertaining at all.
B00001IVOR|5.0|Amazing lyrics over incredible beats. If you buy one hip-hop album, it should be this one, and not just cuz it's two discs. :D This is a far cry from the bull on the radio and TV these days. Real hip-hop, powerful subject matter delivered with expert lyricism. What are you still reading this review for? GET IT!
0380002930|5.0|I first picked up this bulky book in the fourth grade when encouraged by my librarian to read bigger books. I cannot thank her enough.<br />Watership Down is the best book I have ever read. Although the characters of the book are rabbits, you only faintly realize it as you read. Richard Adams connects our world to that of the rabbits so skillfully the bond is almost seamless. Adams has a true gift for writing: you feel like you are right there beside Hazel, Bigwig, Fiver, and the rest. You can feel the tension, live the suspense. There is not a single word in this novel that does not belong. And when all of those words are strung together, they make for a powerful, soulful punch.<br />Perhaps the best part of Watership Down is the feeling of contentment it leaves you with at the bittersweet end. You can just sit there for a moment, and think back over the journey the characters went through. You come away from the experience satisfied.<br />I highly recommend this stirring book, Watership Down.
0553108034|3.0|The writing is excellent, but if you become attached to the characters the contuining strife and pain the characters face can become overwhelming.
B0001932ZA|3.0|I'm love Arnold movies, and this one was one of my favorites from the 80's. In the re-mastered version there a documentary called lock down. This political liberal crap does not belong on this DVD. It's quite clear that these people have truly lost their minds now. If I knew ahead of time this was on the DVD I may not have bought it. The movie is very clear and sound quality is good.
B00020HEL6|5.0|An absolute stunner!  From &quot;Summertime&quot; (which is way better than Fantasia's from American IDOL!:)) to &quot;Slow Boat to CHina&quot; you will be amazed that this voice is coming from a teenager.  In a time when Brittney's influence and popularity are happily waning, it's so cool to hear real singers doing real songs.  These songs are standards for a reason people, they ar 50yrs+ and sound as relevant today.  This kid has a future and look forward to hearing much more from her. Hey David Foster throw her and MIchael Buble and studio and let 'em do a duet cd.
B00008LDPU|4.0|The Animatrix is a set of nine short animations, all very different in look and in story, loosely set in the world of The Matrix.<br />There's a lot to like in this set. The opening piece, 'The Final Flight of the Osiris,' is the best super-realistic animation I've seen to date. Later, 'World Record' uses its hard-edged graphic style almost in praise of its central figure, an athlete. Realism could never convey the human physical power shown here. The final piece, 'Matriculated,' uses a more fantastic style, creating almost a sense of a war between gods.<br />Each piece ends on an ambiguous note; there's always more story to come. I will be interested to see more, if it holds to the standard set by the best of these pieces. There is a real danger of downward sequel creep, though. Even within this collection, some pieces lacked the energy of others.<br />This is an enjoyable and varied set of animations. They are loosely federated under the Matrix banner, but you don't need to have seen (or even have enjoyed) The Matrix to like these.
1891252089|5.0|This book is amazing!  I've practiced yoga for about 12 years now.  I've always vinyasa flow classes, you know enough to make me sweat but still stay in my comfort zone.  I decided to start studying Ashtanga.  This book is perfect.  IT lays out the poses clearly as well modifications.  For example, I don't see the shoulder stand, plow, or headstand in my future and this has very practical modifications.  If you can purchase this with Swenson's &quot;Short Forms&quot; vhs or dvd.  I practice the 30 or 45 minute routine 3-4x's a week ( I balance it routines by Baptiste, Kest or Eoin Finn as I feel I get more stretch from their classes).  If you are an intermediate yogi and want to take the plunge into Ashtanga, Swenson is your man.  Be prepared to sweat!
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Avril shows the true rock singer she is in this new album including her hit singles &amp;quot;My Happy Ending&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Don't Tell Me&amp;quot;. Her first Cd Let Go was totally beginner music, like a practice cd. I didn't like more than 3 songs on the album but this new cd is my favorite cd ever. Her songs are directed to teens, her songs show that she thinks and feels the same as all of us. I really like &amp;quot;Fall To Pieces&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Take Me Away&amp;quot; too. Very modern rock songs with really catchy music, awesome combinations of drums and guitars that are popular to teens now. I would totally suggest this to anyone especially teens. It's a must have album!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I had hesitated about this box set for awhile as I had heard mixed reviews.  After reading the reviews on Amazon.com (and being desperate for something GOOD to watch after the WB so INANELY canceled Angel) I went ahead and picked up Firefly...Let me say this is as good in its own way as Buffy and Angel.  Any fan of Joss Whedon should LOVE this well written, thoughtful, witty show.  It is the best in its genre I have EVER seen.  I was THOUROUGHLY impressed with it and LOVE it!!!  Unfortunately it is entirely too fresh, and just plain to0 good for mainstream TV to appreciate.  I can't wait for the movie and can only hope that maybe the movie will inspire the series to be resurrected on sci-fi or some other worthy station!!!  Joss Whedon continually surprises us with his fresh shows that always keep us coming back for more!!!  BUY THIS SET....YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WITH IT!!!
B0000524E5|3.0|\\"Coyote Ugly\\" is an interesting movie that falls more into the lines of a teenager type love story than what I had originally thought it would be.  Billed as an \\"intoxicating sexy comedy\\" from producer Jerry Bruckheimer, this movie more or less falls short of that billing in that it relies more heavily on the \\"girl with a long shot makes it big\\" theme that has been highly prevalent in previous movies, leaving one with the overwhelming impression of been there, seen that.<br />Performance wise; stars such as Piper Parabo, John Goodman and Maria Bello all do a great job with the script they had.  I'm more or less surprised that Maria Bello hasn't become a bigger star as she definitely has it in her and she's an incredibly beautiful woman.  <br />This is the only movie from director David McNally II that I've seen so far and it would be hard to make a definitive judgment on his movie making talents based on this one movie that I didn't find particularly wonderful.  Hopefully down the road he'll find a better script to work with.<br />The Premise:<br />As stated above, this is a teenager type movie about Violet (Piper Parabo) who moves from rural New York to the Big Apple to make it big as a song writer.  Along the way she encounters the standard fare of difficulties of trying to get into that business and finds that she must take on a job at a bar known as the \\"Coyote Ugly\\" to try to make ends meet until she can get that \\"one big break.\\"<br />Overall, I'd say this is an interesting rental more than anything else.  {ssintrepid}<br />Special Features:<br />-Additional Scenes Not Seen In Theaters<BR>-Behind The Scenes Featurettes<BR>*Coyote 101<BR>*How To Be A Coyote<BR>*Inside The Songs<BR>*Search For The Stars<BR>-LeAnn Rimes Music Video<BR>-Audio Commentary With Producer Jerry Bruckheimer, Director David McNally And The Coyotes<BR>-\\"Action Overload\\" Reel Featuring the Hottest Moments From The Movie - Music Video-Style

B0000C9JCM|4.0|This is the only classical music I own, and I purchased it because Pachelbel's Canon in D is the most beautiful piece of music I have ever heard.  I fell in love with Canon when I heard my first haunting rendition of it featured in the movie Ordinary People.  Later, when I heard it as a selection during a marriage ceremony, I made sure to check the program for the title and artist so that I could use it at my own wedding.<br />So, as my first wedding anniversary approaches, I decided to treat myself to this CD, a delightful compilation of many different Canon interpretations.  Of course, the album includes several classic orchestral arrangements, but other versions include a piano duet, flute and harmonica features, and even a few vocal performances.  The soft, flowing nature of the Canon makes it perfect relaxing background music.  If you love Canon in D, Pachelbel's Greatest Hit is sure to be a hit with you.
B000009QOC|5.0|This is a masterpiece from hard rock's finest. Although Glenn's voice may seem a little weird, you'll get used to it. Although the music is not quite heavy metal, the lyrics are, so it occupies the somewhat gray area between hard rock and heavy metal. This pretty much sounds like Black Sabbath or KISS with Jim Morrison singing. It is one of my all-time favorite albums. When this record was released in 1990, it caught a lot of controversy over the rather evil lyrics. But heavy metal fans loved it, and even one of Danzig's songs, Mother became a huge chart hit. This, I feel is better than Danzig's first, because the guitars and stuff are weirder.
B00005JKZ3|2.0|Men in Black II begins with a delightful opening sequence that plays as a parody of the first film. In what also serves as a precursor to the story to come, the Men in Black concept is made fun of through the presentation of an over-the-top underground video that consists of poorly constructed special effects and a story that would be rejected by even the least known science-fiction television serial. When the sequence reappears at a later point in the film, the comment is made that it must be something from Spielberg. Had the rest of the film captured the playful mood of this opening sequence, Men in Black II would have been right on par with its predecessor. Unfortunately, that doesn't happen.<BR> <BR>The biggest problem with Men in Black II is that it simply isn't very entertaining as nothing much happens throughout the majority of the film (a quality that makes the film feel much longer than its 88 minute running time suggests). Given the summer-popcorn nature of the film this would have been somewhat forgivable had the problem only plagued the plot. But the same problem also plagues the film's action sequences, special effects and jokes (a problem that is compounded for anybody who has seen the film's trailer before seeing the film). There isn't enough of the devices that made the first film so much fun, and when such devices do appear, they often feel recycled from the first film and or were already revealed in this film's marketing campaign. Its almost as if the film is running on cruise control.<BR> <BR>So what does happen in Men in Black II? Mostly just a lot of Agent J (Will Smith) and Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) traveling back and forth throughout New York City in an attempt to stop the evil alien Serleena (Lara Flynn Boyle) from destroying the planet. Every now and then there is a plot twist that comes out of the blue, with such twist usually revolving around the romance between Agent J and Rita (the only witness to a murder committed by Serleena early inthe film). The character development of Rita (Rosario Dawson) is developed to a much lesser extent than the character of Laurel Weaver (Linda Fiorentino) in the first film. This feels highly awkward given the importance Rita plays in both the love story and eventually, the narrative as a whole. The end result is a love story that makes the something-to-be-desired love stories of both Spider-Man and Attack of the Clones look much more impressive in comparison. At least both of those films tried.<BR> <br />One area of Men in Black II that still works, at least to a certain extent, is its use of aliens for comedic value. While many of the non-alien based jokes fall flat, the film's use of alien-based jokes is the one aspect that comes closest to duplicating the enjoyable nature of the first film. Return appearances by the worms, Fred the talking dog, and especially the appearance of a new alien-race who live inside of a locker, provide some of the film's better moments. But such moments are too few in between, and for every moment that does work in this regard, there seems to be an equally unfunny moment just around the corner (with many of them involving the two-headed alien played by Johnny Knoxville).<BR> <BR>In any area of comparison, Men in Black II doesn't live up to its predecessor. The first film succeeded in being a strong piece of summer entertainment, that stood out from the rest of the summer crowd at the same time. Men in Black II does neither, when it could have and should have done both.<BR> <BR>*1/2, (4.5/10)
0345404475|5.0|This novel, first published in 1968, was the basis for Ridley Scott's film Blade Runner (1982), which despite its striking, evocative visuals, plucks elements of the novel out of their context, making them somewhat less intelligible and less radical than in the original. Additionally, Dick's humor and his metaphysics are missing from the movie. The reader of the book is continually challenged to evaluate how human the androids are and how mechanical the humans are. The androids are not mere machines like most of the simulacra in Dick's other novels: they are artificial people made from organic materials; they have free will and emotions like fear and love. Physically and behaviorally they are indistinguishable from real people. Rick Deckard is a bounty hunter whose job it is to hunt down and kill escaped androids. His life is thoroughly programmed; but in the course of the novel he starts to wake up to his buried human nature and capacity for empathy and understanding. This novel is the place to look for a serious analysis of the question of what it means to be human; you get only the tip of the iceberg of that issue in the movie. The book is one of Dick's best.
B0001I55OC|1.0|Having read the Crichton book of the same title I felt it necessary to see the film, to satisfy my curiosity if nothing else. While some changes may have been necessary to pad out the script and keep the movie flowing, there is no excuse for the major changes which ruined the script. Bad acting also followed this film, and there was no real connection between any of the actors. This film would appeal to many if they enjoy a good action film, but for anyone who read the book it is just a let-down. The one star I award this film is out of sympathy only.
0792840461|3.0|After enjoying the remake of this movie I ordered the DVD of the original.  I loved it at the theater back in the sixties and hadn't seen it since then.  For once in a blue moon, I discovered I liked the remake better!  The plot is only vaguely the same for these two movies.  I remember this film was a great departure for Steve McQueen and he still seems to have a thug-like quality to me.  Ms. Dunaway is a walking parade of late-sixties fashion, with lots of makeup and eyelashes.  Strange, I didn't ever realize she had a scar on her forehead.  Regardless, the style of cinematography is extremely dated now.  Sort of like what today's jerky-camera commercials will look like a few years from now.  Oh, it's fun to watch.  It's just not as good a story as the remake.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I dont know what I was to expect when I picked up this album about to purchase it. I didnt think it was going to match up to the overall brilliantess of \\"LET GO\\", I loved every single song on that album and that has only happened 1 other time. So I got it. And when I played it, it sounded cool, the opening track \\"Take me away\\" and once each song flowed on to the next, I loved this album, forget about all of those negative reviews from stupid people who havent even heard the album and judge her on what she is \\"posing\\" as. This album is really good and really catchy! I mean that A L O T . Some lyrics may be a little under-written and the vocals arent what you call Christina Aguilera,but she isnt trying to be in -your-face SEX pop.It IS a really good album and a brilliant follow up to \\"Let Go\\". Technically, its like \\"Let Go Part II\\" both albums would be amazing if they were packaged together and released together. I am going to review each song now:<br />1. Take Me Away.....Great start to the album 10/10<br />2.Together....... I think of this as \\"Complicated Part II\\" cuz if you listen to the lyrics, it is. 10/10<br />3.Don't Tell Me......... good 1st single, I wouldve chosen another one. Good song .But im getting kinda tired of it. 9/10<br />4. He Wasnt....... This is one thats not amazing for me, cuz it sounds so cheerleadery but again its kinda like \\"Sk8r Boi Part II\\" but not AS exciting..............8/10<br />5.How Does It Feel?........ I love this song. Its so nice! 10/10<br />6.My Happy Ending........... this song is nice too and Avrils 1st swear word....Sh*t! Its nothing huge to consider though (the swear word--the song rules!) 10/10<br />7. Nobodys Home.......... Again a nice song, light rock, is a good way to put it. 10/10<br />8. Forgotten......... this is SO Evanescence!!! Its cool........ 10/10<br />9.Who Knows?......... another nice song additon to the album 9.5/10<br />10.Fall To Pieces....... Nice. 10/10<br />11. Freak Out........ Hmmmmmmmmmmm a slower version of Sk8r Boi? kinda..... not rocky, well it is. Kind of a \\"Sk8r Boi Part III (Remix)\\" yeah.  8.7/10<br />12. Slipped Away....... OMG!

6305657947|5.0|I won't go into the plot of this movie, most buyers will already know it anyway.  The DVD transfer is superb.  This is the only movie I've ever seen where I liked Pierce Brosnan and thought he was cast properly.  What makes this movie for me, though, is the performance of Ms. Russo.  She is the perfect combination of sex and brains.  Her wardrobe is amazing and she knows how to wear it!  There are some slow parts to this movie, particularly the tropical part, but overall it's a keeper.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I definately have been anticipating this album since Let Go came out. This is a great CD, I even pre-ordered it and its such a great CD. More rock, more of her vocals show, etc... Her 2 singles &quot;Dont Tell Me&quot; and &quot;Happy Ending&quot; are really great songs of hers. She wrote or co-wrote I think every song on this album. I cant say enough about it. Go and get it. This definately isnt one of those albums you just buy for the one song and the rest sucks. Its such a great CD.
0140177396|5.0|Of Mice and Men is truly a masterpiece. John Steinbeck does it again. This is a story about a mentally retarded man who travels around with his friend. They go to a ranch and a lot of things go amiss. I don't want to give it away. The way Steinbeck wrote this book was very powerful and meaningful. There is definitely a strong message buried into the pages of this tragic novelization. If you're looking for a well-written, to the point book, you should buy Of Mice and Men.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|This cd is even more horriable than the last two which i didnt even think was possiable.  This is just anpther example of untaltend nu-metal garbage.  They are so ashamed of their own main-stream targted music they have to wear masks.  It takes like ten people to make this crap.  Why waste your money?  Why dont you stop being a wuss and buy some real metal.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Look, it's a nice, crisp dollar!<br />You can have it....<br />If you go far, far away and never attempt to &quot;sing&quot; (with the help of your synthesizer and computer gimmicks) or &quot;make music&quot; (Dear God, it's not even music!) ever, ever again.<br />See the dollar.....**throws**....GO GET IT!!<br />God, what a waste.
B00005JKHP|4.0|\\"Welcome aboard.\\" - Admiral James T. Kirk welcomes an old, pointed eared, friend aboard The Enterprise in \\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\\"<br />The first of ten films in the \\"Trek\\" saga gets off to a whimper instead of a bang.<br />An alien known as V'ger with immense energy and power is on a course for Earth, destroying and absorbing anything in its path. The only Federation ship in the vicinity is, of course, the U.S.S. Enterprise. Kirk and crew are sent to destroy the being before it reaches Earth. But, when Kirk & co. find out that V'ger is more of a sentient being with human origins than alien, the crew tries to find out what V'ger wants and why, before time runs out & Earth becomes part of V'ger.<br />Overall the film is o.k. Most fans were excited to see Kirk, Spock, McCoy and the rest of the crew with The Enterprise up on the big screen for the first time in film history, no matter what they did (personally, I never saw the film when it was in theaters).<br />With the cult status that the T.V. show gathered in reruns over the years since its cancellation, it was inevitable that \\"Star Trek\\" would be revived again in some form another. Originally, Paramount saw \\"Star Trek\\" as a way to start its own television network that could rival NBC, ABC, & CBS, with the new incarnation of \\"Trek\\" being its headlining show. But, with the monsterous success of \\"Star Wars\\", studios were scrambling for any script they had with a sci-fi element. 20th Century Fox immediatelly greenlighted \\"Alien\\" with Paramount taking \\"Star Trek\\" & turning into a big screen feature instead of a headlining television show. \\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\\" was released for the Xmas season of 1979 with mixed reviews.<br />The film isn't really that bad. It falls along one of the more medium, likable episodes from the series (say not as bad as the episode \\"Catspaw\\" but no where near as good as \\"Space Seed\\"). Its great to the see cast on the big screen, but, the problem is they've aged since the series, but, don't seem to act it. In other words there is no backstory to what has happened to the crew since the end of there original five year mission (\\"Star Trek II\\" handles this perfectly). The disco style uniforms with the Dick Tracy style communicators don't help either.<br />The new 2 disc DVD edition is definitely worth looking at, for all of the new CGI work done to the film (henceforth, my four star rating to an otherwise three star film). Also, included are all of the deleted scenes that have info containing whether or not the scene was included in the original ABC broadcast, or if it was on the extended VHS edition, or if it was just plain deleted from the film itself. The trailers are a blast from the past with, known other than, Orson Welles giving the narrative to all trailers and t.v. ads. The featurettes on the making of the film and the restoration are great.<br />If you've seen all of the other \\"Trek\\" films (and stomached \\"Star Trek V\\") then \\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\\" is worth watching.es, but, don't seem to act it.

B0001ADB8C|5.0|George has always been misunderstood by naysayers and those who only saw John and Paul as the true talents of the Fab Four.  Every song that is on this set is pure musical genius. From THIS SONG and SOFT HEARTED HANA to FASTER and BLOW AWAY to THIS IS LOVE and IF THAT WHAT IT TAKES,every song is golden. If you really want to hear real music the way it's supposed to be done, not only get this set, but, if you don't have already, also get ALL THINGS MUST PASS, LIVING IN THE MATERIAL WORLD, DARK HORSE, and EXTRA TEXTURE.  To have George Harrison in your collection is a must if you truly appreciate great music.
B003EYVY0E|4.0|THURS 1/31/13 NOTE:  This film was originally publish June 6, 2004, but the page it was originally posted on, the theatrical release page, no longer exist, so I have moved it here.  With this in mind, you should know that this will not review the Blu Ray's itself or the features only the film.  :)<br /><br />  I've been a HP fan for the last 5 years, read all the books loads many times, seen all the previous movies many times, and think about the HP universe all the time. I do the best I can to separate the books from the movies as a film is only a personal interpretation of the written material, hard to do at times, but often necessary to enjoy book to film adaptations.<br /><br />  Most have heard the overall tone of this movie is a good deal darker than the previous films, which it suits the story, as \\"The Prisoner of Azkaban\\" is where the books began to darken as well. The pace of this film overall, is frantic, it went by before I even realized it, making me want to rush back and see it again. Right from the get-go, you know this is going to be a less fanciful adaptation of the Potter world, while remaining decently faithful to feel & intention of book, and that is what's important, though it is sad that some of the wonder and adventure of the novel is lost, especially the mystery of what the \\"Grimm\\" really is, and Harry's escapades to Hogsmead.<br /><br />  Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, and the whole cast have not only grown up, but grown into fine actors. The acting is positively first-rate. After Richard Harris' spot-on Dumbledore, Michael Gambon took a bit getting used, but now that I've had time to sleep on it, I've come to appreciate his interpretation, in a way, he picks out different aspects of Dumbledore than Harris did, and he becomes less of a fatherly figure, and more of a crusty old man. Tom Felton(Draco Malfoy) and Allen Rickman(Severus Snape) seemed to inhabit their characters more in this film, the script definitely has a lot to do with that. This time instead of finding myself lusting after them, I found myself hating them more, which is kind of the point of their characters in this film.<br /><br />  What a terrific script!  Yes, there were changes from the book to movie, but Steve Cloves did a marvelous job. All the important parts are there, although my sister thought they should've explained a couple things more (this proved to be a major problem in the later films). As stated before, the script is tighter and thus makes the film move at a brisker pace. The way it portrays teen boys as actual teen boys, is nice. There are some lovely moments in the boys dormitory, just fun and silly moments of random boyness.<br /><br />  I'd never seen any of Alfonzo Cuaron's films prior to this (THURS 1/31/13: I later realized I'd actually seem one of his previous films before [[ASIN:B005FDW7AI A Little Princess]], and if you've seen that film, you will know what to expect tone-wise, and script wise for the most part, the feel of the films are very very similar. That film is also the main reason Rowling wanted Cuaron as a director.) and scoffed at the idea of him directing because he seemed to talk like an egotistical idiot when I'd seen/read interviews with him, but after viewing the film, I can at least say, he is a very good director. He needs to direct the next movies after #4(Which is being done by Brittish director Mike Newell, ie. 'Four Weddings and a Funeral'.), since he is not directing 4, but mentioned he may return to the series later.<br /><br />  Instead of focus on the events and trying to make it a \\"light and cheery family affair\\", its focused on the characters and its much more true to the characters in the book, and all the important events are intact anyways. It doesn't tend to focus quite as much on the trivial things, although Quidditch is very important to Harry, its not the focus of the whole book series, and we only see a little bit of it in this film.<br /><br />  I wont say anything else, because I'd like you to experience it yourself, oh and before your own review, give yourself some time to think it through.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amything else, because I'd like you to experience it yourself, oh and before your own review, give yourself some time to think it through.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amy

Great plot, great characters, great sci-fi, great western themes which are fun once you get use to it, great action, great special effects!!!  If I had discovered this show before they cancelled I would have watched it every week.  Everyone should see this show.  Sign the firefly petition and lets hope FOX brings it back!!!

We are all incoming producing assets and it's about time that we get off our assets and take control ala Rich Dad as explained by RTK.<br />Great book. This one is a must read and a must use book.
B000002KIE|5.0|This is a good cd. I just want to say that it is kind of dumb how people can't talk about the Sex Pistols without talking about the Clash or the Damned or some other band from the late 70's. Comparing these bands is like comparing the Beatles with a band like Black Sabbath. They are different.
B00008BLB8|4.0|...the first live album with Craig Frost on keys was better than I thought. I thought the existence of a full time key man would mean keyboard sounds where they didn't belong because the dude couldn't just stand there during the old stuff, could he? But Frost's keyboard work in the earlier material is laudably non-invasive. His organ solos are understated and he uses clavinet a lot to fake a rhythm guitar sound in places where Mark Farner used to overdub it in the studio versions of that material. And because of his presence, a decent version of \\"I'm Your Captain\\" (aka \\"Closer To Home\\") is finally possible, string pads during the coda and all. I don't know how they handled that song live pre-Frost, but it strikes me that the coda, being the last half of the song, the same phrase over and over, would have been boring as hell done with just guitar, bass and drums. I winced when I heard the song \\"Inside and Out\\", though. They pulled the same stunt with that Lomax prison blues classic that they did on the older live set: \\"...workin' all day makin' up....nickel bags\\". The original line from that song was \\"burlap bags\\", as in the inmates working in the jute mill. The way Farner sang it himself in the album version on the \\"Grand Funk\\" release. But you'll hear that part of the song here as a lame Cannabis Liberation Front anthem. I have been playing rock since the mid-1960s and I never could stand the way rock's enemies came right out and said that rock music in general was the musical liturgy of the worship of dope. And I like it even less when peers (GFR are about my age) offer what amounts to testimony for the \\"prosecution\\".
B00005JLH3|4.0|I am all about some good marching band music as it is, so when I heard drumline was actually coming to a theater near me, I rushed to the box office.What I watched was a beautiful depiction of black college marching bands and all the drama that comes with trying to be the best. There as a wake up area for cannon when he couldn't read music, when he thought he had the drumline position on lock, and when he was chosing to leave the school for J. Anthony brown's school. All of this is both accurate and entertaining. Either way, the movie was very good and well worth the watch. On top of that, there is some really good music being played by both the soundtrack and by the bands.

B000007492|5.0|Man, this is so good. . .and I claim to not even like Supertramp.  Not liking Supertramp, though, is like not liking The Beach Boys or ABBA- - -anyone who claims not to like them invariably finds him or herself singing and tapping their uncontrollable toes right along with them when no one's looking and is careful never to admit it to anyone.  This is a pretty intelligent compilation, too, even though it completely ignores SUPERTRAMP and INDELIBLY STAMPED, the bands first two LPs with a different lineup.  That's okay, though, as they had quite a different sound on those first albums and pretty much anything from them would sound a bit jarring here.  Check 'em out anyway, they're pretty good. Anyhoo, VERY BEST OF contains all (okay, both of) the big hits, of course, and some astonishingly great LP tracks as well- -yes, \\"Take The Long Way Home\\" is superlative (that beautiful harmonica intro! that sax break!), and so is \\"The Logical Song\\", but it's nice to have tracks like \\"School\\" (another great harmonica intro!), \\"Goodbye Stranger\\" and \\"Breakfast In America\\" here along with them.  They were semi-hits of their own anyway, and do rate among the band's best material.  It's amazing how consistent these guys were- -the compilation is hardly chronological, yet all the songs follow one another seamlessly.  And while Supertramp makes no effort to hide their influences- -\\"Take The Long Way Home\\" quotes the Bee Gees, and \\"Goodbye Stranger\\" nicks Boz Scaggs' \\"Dina Flo\\" virtually note for note- -at least they are decent enough influences.  My Complaint Department admonishes, however, that while what the liner notes claim is in fact true- -i.e., that \\"at least one representative track from each\\" of the band's \\"top-selling\\" albums is present- -they are a little too literal in their representation of most of the albums themselves:  CRIME OF THE CENTURY is represented no less than a whopping six times and BREAKFAST IN AMERICA four (heck, the first nine songs here are from those two albums).  But EVEN IN THE QUIETEST MOMENTS is represented only twice, and by what in my unhumble opinion are not even the best songs from that album. And poor little CRISIS?

0812416643|5.0|I read this book before I ventured out into the real world, and I read it again many years after I had returned from that world. After I read it, I wanted to kick myself for not learning more from it the first time.... But then, that is also covered in this story, Siddhartha's father could not protect him from the world, nor could Siddhartha protect his own son when the time came. You've got to go forth and learn these lessons yourself. It is the same archetypical patterns, with variations, over and over.<br /> I remember that when I first read this story it confused me that the Buddha and Siddhartha were two separate persons. Then I came to realise the truth of archetypes, and immortal paterns that resonate in many different bodies at the same time- all seemingly separate, but all really sharing the same great life. All ultimately flowing together to form the great river of life.

I can't understand how a director could cast a plain, chubby young women in such a role.  Any erotic value that this movie may have is taken away by how fat (chubby anyways) this girl is.  This would have been a much better movie had the lead role been played by a younger and much more attractive (physically and sexually) girl.

1592400876|3.0|The only thing that most of the reviews about this book has in common is their grammar and punctuation -- most folks seem to love the book, several rail against it, and a handful appear to have no opinion. But almost nobody has been willing to read this unlikely best seller and then write a review that ignores the lessons about punctuation the book focuses on. That in itself offers strong proof about its value.<br />Eats, Shoots & Leaves is a charming book and an unusual success story, and I applaud it for bringing to the fore a debate about the aspect of our language that has suffered most from its inundation under a sea of Internet chat and cellular text messaging. Using a mix of humor and anecdotes, author and journalist Lynne Truss manages to create a highly readable and enjoyable primer that not only explains how punctuation works but why it is important.<br />If you have any doubt, witness the sentence: \\"A woman without her man is nothing.\\" Now add two lonely punctuation marks and the meaning is turned on its head: \\"A woman: without her, man is nothing.\\" The title of the book is another example -- it is supposed to be a description of the diet of pandas, but because of poor punctuation it sounds more like a complaint about a murderous dinner guest.<br />Fair warning: American readers might have problems with some of Ms. Truss's vocabulary (a \\"fag\\" is a cigarette in England; \\"rubbers\\" are erasers), and her statements about placing all punctuation marks outside quotation marks and the frequency with which she uses Britishisms like \\"actually\\" and \\"obviously\\" will stand out to readers already comfortable with their grip on grammar and punctuation. A lot of those problems could have been eliminated by putting the manuscript in the hands of a thoughtful editor before releasing it in the United States.<br />I also have a problem with treating punctuation as an end rather than as a means to an end. I think anyone who writes even a grocery list while trying to remember thousands of often archaic and obscure rules could starve to death before they ever make it to the supermarket. The ultimate goal should be to make the writer's intent clear. Punctuation is simply a tool to that end.thousands of often archaic and obscure rules could starve to death before they ever make it to the supermarket.

B0001UL7RY|4.0|I am a 47 year-old man and hey I like Avril Lavigne, but then I am a guitarist myself, and an artist, so I appreciate good music. I am hooked on Avril's music, what can I say? I like her in-your-face attitude, her mix of acoustic and electric -- though I would like to see a few more pure acoustic titles on this CD like on her first (&quot;Tomorrow&quot;, etc.).  On this new CD I notice a few tunes that utilize some new vocal harmonies that I really like -- such as  track#3 &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; and track#5 &quot;How Does it Feel&quot; (my favorite tune on the entire CD; a very nice song with great harmony, nice lyrics, etc.). This CD is going to be another hit for Avril Lavigne.
B00003CX96|4.0|I don't want to make a bigger deal out of this movie than it deserves. It's not a world-changer and the ending is a bit predictable, but it is a wonderful and charming coming of age story and an honest look at small-town America. And cycling and Italians play central roles -- a plus for an American cyclist living in Italy, like me.<br />But having an affinity for things Italian or for bike racing is not necessary in order to enjoy this 25-year-old classic. What is necessary is an appreciation for small things and memories about the mysterious period between adolescence and adulthood. If that describes you, then chances are you'll enjoy this touching film.<br />Amid the praise I should say that the DVD package is only average: the original trailer and teaser are there, but it would have been nice to have some commentary from director Peter Yates, some of the actors, or from critics who were fans of the film. A &quot;Making of Breaking Away&quot; mini feature would have also been a welcome addition.<br />One note: Breaking Away is a very American film, and so I'm not so sure how much of it will hit home with foreign viewers.

B00005JLR8|4.0|Call me a sucker, but I fall for movies like this.  Sure, it could have been an over the top sentimental movie, but the suburb acting and cinematography saved it.   The movie deals with death and redemption and the hope that America offers for those who have lost all hope.  Grieving from the death of their two-year-old son, an Irish family illegally immigrates to America to make a fresh start.   Yes, the film could have easily fallen into a formula flick, but the superb performances by Samantha Morton (the mother) and Emma Bolger (the youngest daughter) save the show.  They are simply riveting. <br />Throughout the movie we see a struggle for faith.  The lost faith of the father, the struggling faith of the mother and the persistent faith of the children, especially of Ariel, the youngest.   How does one deal with the death of a child?  Statistically most marriages do not survive a death of a child, the guilt, the accusations, the ifs become overwhelming.  The Sullivans run away from Ireland but they cannot run away from their inner demons, they must be faced.<br />This is also a story about in America.  The Sullivans make their new home in a drug-invested ghetto in Manhattan.  Despite their poverty, they see America as hope for redemption as a family.  The motley crew of characters they encounter show what makes America great- different people, different cultures come together to be something they were not before- Americans.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|Absolution will convert any non-Muse fans to avid followers of their every move. Absolution is the product of a combination of so many bands that they are completely unique. They sound like the merger of Radiohead with Queens of the Stone Age, add Deftones, stir, a touch of The Clash, an undercurrent of Placebo and absolutely astounding piano riffs. I'm just wondering why amazon haven't said anything official about this album yet. If the world hasn't npticed muse yet now is the time to sit up and lisen. Absolution has stronger bass lines and drums than Showbiz and has lost the Blur-ness. All this coupled with astounding production make for undoubtably one of the best releases this year.<br />ps they don't really sound anything like Bends-era radiohead so if you're looking for more of that stuff you won't find it here, the only similarity being in the vocals
0767805712|5.0|It wasn't exactly surprising that this masterful film escaped most radars. Without bombastic effects and without any mass promotion and media brouhaha it was released almost silently and has gained the reputation of a true classic ever since.<br />   Twenty minutes into this film and all the tell-tale signs of a great and capturing story are already well in place and it almost never lets down after that.<br />   With all the dystopia banners obvious to anyone who's lost his optimism, Gattaca is about the story of a future society where ID has become one's gene-pool. Those with an \\"acceptable\\" gene combination are given access to the better jobs and prospects, and most importantly a chance to leave this planet for outer space, where, by then, humans are exploring domains far beyond their own solar system. Those with an undesirable gene combination, that is, big probability for disease, or other health failures and low life expectancy, are deemed, and doomed, to become society's low-rank water-carriers. The first category is the \\"valids\\" and the second the \\"in-valids\\".<br />    One such invalid driven by his passionate dream of outer-space travel, finds a way to beat the system, by using blood and hair samples of a former valid who's incapacitated by partial paralysis. He assumes his new ID with full co-operation by the former invalid, and both these peoples' lives become an excruciating every day routine of trying to keep beating the control-checks and achieving each their own goals. Things turn even edgier when a murder investigation inside the base for space-travel points worrying leads towards the (...) and the police are hot on his trail. From then on it becomes a race of time. If he makes it he's safe for good, safe in the confines of the surreal distance that will separate him and the earth as his destination is Titan, a planet several years of distance away.<br />   Gattaca is without a doubt one of the most intelligent films in recent time. Packed with superbideas about a dystopian future without resorting to pomposity is its utter brilliance, subtle and convincing performances cement the result and the directing is equally great, using color and unidentifiable space to set the atmosphere.<br />    Ethan Hawke plays the system-beater according to the cue of the story, always below the surface, and always with a \\"looking-behind-the-shoulder\\" aura. But the show is actually stolen by Jude Law, his Identity Giver and an ex-wonder \\"gene holder\\", who has to daily swallow his bitterness while trying to make what he thinks as best out of the situation. Uma Thurman is rather confined to the backround in the story, making Gattaca primarily a two-actor film. But this never undermines the force of this movie, instead it helps emphasize the story even more.<br />    Incredibly poetic, especially the ending, and melancholically romantic, Gattaca is a tremendous film the full impact of which catches up with you after it's finished. Great on all levels with the slight exception of the love affair between Hawke and Thurman which doesn't serve much really but that does little to undermine the overall picture.<BR>    Essential for the sci-fi oriented and fans of intelligent cinema alike.

I was disappointed that we found out &quot;who done it&quot; way too early in the book.  But a new plot was offered in it's place.  The outcome was somewhat more predictable than the first plot. But it increased my awareness of the struggles parents of autistic children might go through--again offering &quot;outsiders&quot; a chance to be more compassionate to someone we know in such circumstances.<br />I didn't particularly find the book very funny even though other reviews said it was.<br />Would I still choose it knowing what I know now?  Yes!  And that's because it was written as if a 15-year old autistic boy wrote it making it an entertaining, enlightning and an easy read.<br />I could have done without all of the &quot;math problems,&quot; but would highly recommend it to anyone who loves a good math challenge or someone who would benefit from understanding the mind and emotions of an autistic child (or adult) without having to read a boring, factual, medical book!<br />I even learned a few, new, interesting tidbits that may benefit me the next time I play a trivia game.
B0001IN07Q|1.0|Musically - pretty much every arrangement in that album is taken from Sinatra, Peggy Lee or George Michael. Not even a variation in notes or in the chord progression. Almost everything is copied note for note. <br />Vocally - pretty much every vocal riff in that album is taken from Sinatra, Darin, Torme, Harry Connick, etc. The only difference between him and the orginals - he's a 20-something Canadian with a great producer.<br />People who tend to buy this probably don't have any album from Frank Sinatra's Reprise label... Also, they may have never heard Peggy Lee sing &quot;Fever,&quot; or George Michael singing &quot;Kissing A Fool.&quot;  The reason why I say that is because Michael Buble COPIED from them NOTE FOR NOTE!!!  Why would you buy anything you've heard done better before?<br />If you're a jazz enthusiast, don't get this album.  Stick with the greats.  If you don't know Gene Autry from Frank Sinatra, Perry Como from Mel Torme, then by all means, waste your money on this album.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Jim Caviezel, who has the same initials as Jesus Christ, was sent straight from heaven to play the role of our savior.  He was even struck by lightning during the part of the movie where he was crucified.  What more evidence do you want?  This film was a vision given to Mel Gibson straight from God.  It is a gorgeous cinematic experience and you will walk straight from this movie to the nearest Church to thank Jesus for his sacrifice.
B000006OAM|5.0|I must say i have to disagree with a number of the reviewers here who think that &quot;Ophelia&quot; is too morose, or dark, or simply too hard to sink into. This is one of the most powerful records i have ever heard... &quot;Tigerlily&quot; and &quot;Motherland&quot; (both also Merchant original alubms), while lovely in their own right have neither the quiet contemplation or simple majesty of Ophelia. Ophelia is just not the kind of album you can listen to in the background with the vacuum running, but that doesn't make it inaccesible as it was my first Natalie Merchant album i think that makes me an authority!<br />Merchant brilliantly runs the full emotional gauntlet, from the haunting title track &quot;Ophelia&quot; which speaks of the human condition throughout time and beyond the single life of any one person, through the bittersweet yet hopeful &quot;life is sweet&quot;, a piece dedicated to taking life by the horns. The dazziling melodies of &quot;frozen charlotte&quot; and &quot;my skin&quot; serve not only to highlight Merchant's truly gifted songwriting and lyricism but stand as a showcase for the full expression and emotion this singer is capable of and is rarely seen elsewhere to this extent. &quot;Break your heart&quot; is another clincher which reminds us again of the savagery, and beauty, of the human condition, glimpsed from a rare place of clarity. Final tracks &quot;effigy&quot; and &quot;the living&quot; bring us out of the emotional heaviness of some others on the album, and while the mood is still somber Merchant has brought us on a journey which takes us above sadness and we settle back and let her words flow over. <BR>&quot;When they ring the golden bells&quot; is a sweet folk tune that brings close the album and entices reminiscence of childhood and times gone before we were born, simpler times, and though it sounds like an ancient irish ballad it is a Merchant original.<br />&quot;Ophelia&quot;, given more than a cursory two plays through,will begin to reveal a subtle and understated pure beauty and elegance rarely found in a music industry intent on mass marketing, radio play singles and lyrics you pick up on first listen. Some reviewers have complained about the quiet mood and lack of singles in &quot;Ophelia&quot;, but i would claim that is what begins to make Ophelia special... it is more than the sum of its parts, it is complete, it is an ALBUM. This is what music SHOULD be!! (Besides, &quot;kind &amp; generous&quot; made a perfect single release).<BR> <BR>A rare thing happened to me while i listened to  to &quot;Ophelia&quot; time and time again... i grew to love and appreciate it more, not less.
0385336810|3.0|I'm so disappointed in this one, because I absolutely loved the Shopaholic books. I read those in a day or two, but I had trouble getting through this one. The story is extremely slow until the very end. And I didn't really find myself too concerned with Emma's problems.<br />All  in all, it's just too predictable to be a page-turner. Stick to the Shopaholics!
0064400557|5.0|A spider saves the life of a friendly pig by spinning accolades about him in her web, thereby producing a miracle that impresses people for miles around.  This is a beautifully written little story for children that has real literary quality.  The prose is excellent.  Note in particular the simple but lovely descriptions of the passing seasons that Mr. White writes.  The themes include friendship, coping with the loss of loved ones, and the realization that life goes on, changed but still worth living.
0790731002|1.0|This movie's worth can be gathered from looking at the box; notice how many faces are on there (five).  That's exactly how this movie plays out, like five stars trying to get their shots in.  Kilmer didnt seem that bad nor did Kidman, but I don't want to watch a movie featuring the joker and two-face.  The series is based on Batman but I felt that Batman is a side-note in films 3 and 4.  Films 3 and 4 just prove how much of a genius Tim Burton is.
B0001BPREM|5.0|My daughter, who had seen this film and loved it, suggested that we watch it together. I agreed and was very glad I did so, as I really enjoyed this bittersweet  film. It is a well-acted, well-directed effort about a free-thinking art history professor, Katherine Watson (Julia Roberts), who in the nineteen fifties, lacking Ivy League credentials, manages, through a twist of fate,  to get a berth as a professor at traditional and conservative Wellesley College. It is here that she hopes to find herself instructing the leaders of tomorrow.<br />What she finds, instead, is a group of highly intelligent,  young women, who are more interested in marrying the leaders of tomorrow than in being leaders themselves. Ms. Watson succeeds in opening the minds of her students to the possibilities and choices life can offer and learns a little about such possibilities and choices herself.  She also finds friendship and romance while at Wellesley College.  The film also focuses on four of her students, all of whom are given stellar portrayals by the young actresses playing them.<br />Elizabeth &quot;Betty&quot; Warren (Kirsten Dunst) is the quintessential fifties girl, obsessed with getting her Mrs. before getting her BA. She later discovers that one should be careful for what one wishes. She is also a nasty piece of work who doesn't care what misery for others her poison pen invectives and barbed comments cause. She eventually gets her comeuppance in a way that she never envisioned. Her best friend, Joan Brandwyn (Julia Styles), is a beautiful, highly intelligent, young woman who harbors a secret wish to become a lawyer. Yet, at the same time, she desperately wants to become a wife and mother. Hers is a decision between choices. She ultimately makes a choice that causes Ms. Watson some consternation but with which she is happy. Giselle Levy (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is a young Jewish miss in a WASP environment who finds herself having short term affairs with her hunky professor and with an older, married man. Connie Baker (Ginnifer Goodwin) is a pleasingly plump, pretty cellist who finds true love, only to find it derailed by the ever evil Betty.<br />Marcia Gay Harden is brilliant in the supporting role of  Nancy Abbey, Wellesley College's professor of etiquette and deportment, who, one discovers, has not always followed her own staid advice. Noted British actress, Juliet Stevenson, is outstanding in the small role of Amanda Armstrong, the college nurse and closet lesbian, who is still mourning the loss of her companion of many years. Marian Seldes is perfectly cast as President Jocelyn Carr, whose role at the college seems to be that of keeping the well-heeled alumni and trustees of Wellesley College happy with the status quo.  Donna Mitchell turns in a stunning performance as Betty's self-absorbed mother, a woman who is a slave to the expected and puts appearances before her daughter's happiness. Julia Roberts is luminous as the role of Katherine Watson, infusing it with an intelligence and natural warmth that radiates off the screen. Though she has a little bit too contemporary an edge, she still manages to carry the day in the role of the forward thinking professor with the Mona Lisa smile.<br />All in all, this is a wonderful, highly enjoyable film in which the social mores and style of the nineteen fifties are well depicted.an older, married man.

B0001Z53AQ|1.0|This album is Garbage. Devils Night I thought was pretty good, there were some decent beats and the lyrics were okay. This was utter crap though. i mean the first track is sounds like my little brother singing songs on his little elementry bus. The best track gets ruined by Bizzare..&quot;Just like U&quot; Produced By Hi-teck, I mean they could have atleast put Em and Proof on that one. Well I guess d12 had to sell out just like every single person that gets decent air time.
B00000JCOV|5.0|I feel that this is the all-around best cd ever created. I know that alot of people would choose Metallica or Slayer over Slipknot, but I feel Slipknot is the most talented band in the entire world. I do listen to other bands like Metallica, Staatic-X, Pantera, and Mudvayne(to name a few), but these other great bands don't have the same edge or intensity in their music and their image. I know that most people feel that Slipknot is a gimmick because of the jumpsuits and masks, but I feel everyone is entitled to their own opinion and should decide for themselves on whether they like something or not. Listen to some of the really good songs on this Cd, suck as Eyeless, Wait and Bleed, Spit It Out, Liberate, Prosthetics, and No Life, and decide for yourself if u want to purchase this cd. But if u like metal u should just buy the f###in' thing.
B0001UL7RY|3.0|First of all, anyone who's reviewing this cd should actually listen to it before giving an opinion! That is my pet peeve. If you listened to it and hated it, fine, but don't give a bad review before listening to the cd!! Incase you haven't noticed, we are reviewing AVRIL'S cd and not The Beatles, Aerosmith, or The Cure! There are pages for them where you can express how much you think they rock.<br />Alright, the reason I only give this cd three stars instead of four is because of the first two songs. The beginning of a cd can make or break whether people keep it playing to hear out the rest of the cd, and this one fails miserably. If you can get past the first two songs on the cd then you just might like the other ones. Everyone can tell from those first two songs Avril's sound has definitely matured and she has been sounding better at live performances. I'm just not sure yet if I like this &quot;new sound.&quot; She sounds like she's screaming her songs on half the cd.<br />The second reason why. Face it, the lyrics suck. They are well below her full potential as an artist. I don't think Avril used one word below a grade two level on this entire cd. The lyrics are so bland that you can interpret them a thousand different ways. They don't even make sense half the time! Also, there's too much repetition of the lyrics and choruses that makes me wonder if she has any real talent for writing songs at all. She just fabricates her lack of talent with a lot of &quot;ooh&quot;s and &quot;yeah&quot;s. She did this on her first cd, she's done it again.<br />Despite itself, there are some &quot;gems&quot; on this cd. He Wasn't is my favourite song on her new album. It's so catchy and I like the upbeat tune even though she's talking about an ex boyfriend. She's not singing like she's depressed because she had a bad experience. She's using that to move on and find a new guy.<br />So to summarize, this isn't a bad cd, if you liked her first cd it will most likely grow on you butbeware of ridiculously stupid lyrics. Personally I liked Let Go better, but overall this is not a bad second album.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|i just bought under my skin today... its such an awesome cd! way better than the first album. i like the way its more rockier too. sweet as i recommend it to anyone!
B0000214F0|3.0|I had seen this movie before in what I had believed to be the uncut, original version.  I was mistaken.  In the version I saw years ago, there was lots of nudity and a few brief shots of fellatio.  This version has long, drawn-out scenes of pure pornography.  It's not that I mind the sex; Taken on their own, the sex scenes are all beautifully done and, for the most part, fairly erotic (for this kind of thing.)  It's just that none of these scenes are integrated into the rest of the film.  They all come across as utterly gratuitous and ultimately, silly.  Now, if they had just gotten Helen Mirren to disrobe, that would have been a whole other story.<br />The best part of the movie, in my opinion, is the set design.  There are some elaborate set pieces that are simply outrageous - the moving wall of rotating blades is a sight to behold, as is the giant mock-boat contructed to house Caligula's government brothel.  <br />The next best part of this movie is scratching your head in wonder at its cast.  Peter O'Toole?!  John Gielgud?!  Helen Mirren?!  How in the name of Captin Crunch did these people end up in this epic porno flick?  This aspect alone makes Caligula a curiosity that should be seen at least once.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Ok, almost every review I've read so far has said something about &quot;Avril claims to be punk/pop/rock when she's not&quot; well, I believe that music shouldn't even really be labeled too much because the genre can change with every song.  And for the people that review and say that the person is stupid, or tries to explain to us what their &quot;real&quot; personality is...well I wouldn't listen to them because they don't even know her personally so there is no way they could tell you.  I wouldn't listen to the close-minded reviewers that judge her cd before even listening to it, that just makes no sense.  I found this to be a great CD, I liked her first, this one is different, but I think if you liked Let Go, then you will like this one as well.  This album seems to be based more on love than the last, which for me, is good news.  My personal favorites are &quot;He Wasn't, My Happy Ending, Fall To Pieces, and Forgotten&quot;, my least favorites were &quot;Take Me Away, Together&quot; which happen to be the first two, so I'm glad I didn't just judge by what I first heard.  No music sucks, some people just enjoy it more than others.  You should be open minded about music, you might be surprised about what you get, and don't not listen to something because of what supposed genre it's in.
B00005A46T|4.0|I didn't enjoy the change in sound on Iowa from what was on the self-titled CD. It seems more like a Hatebreed CD than Slipknot. More straight-up hardcore and not as rhythimic. But decide for yourself and not by the reviews. Still a kick ass CD though!
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|I'd recommend this to those that love a good story with a bit of tall tale fantasy in them. It's a beautiful, colorful movie of tall tales told by a father to his angry son.<br />I personally found the son's character a bit annoying because of the anger and attitude he constantly gives to his dying father, but if you put your focus away from him, you get drawn into the fathers tales of his life before his time comes.<br />Truly touching. Watch it with your loved ones.
B0001BKAEY|2.0|I was a huge Matrix fan.  The first movie left me breathless (despite the few scenes that are a bit lacking, the rest of the movie was so damn excellent the few mediocre scenes didn't matter).   I really loved the second movie as well.  I thought it was a phenomenal follow up.  I was waiting for the third with extremely high hopes. <br />Perhaps that was the problem.  Maybe I expected too much. <br />I wasn't happy with most of this movie.  It was lame.  The story sucked.  They tried to blend too many divergent philosophies together, only to end with a huge judeo-christian crucifixion.  <br />I truly believe the only reason that Neo was blind at the end is because Keanu Reeves is such a horrible actor. <br />The death scene at the end is the worst piece of crap I have ever seen.  I wanted to laugh.  It was supposed to be tragic, but it was insipid. And very poorly acted. <br />And just when you're really wishing you hadn't plopped down money for this, there's another shoot-em-up-in-a-room-full-of-columns scene. Cuz it worked so well the first time, I guess. <br />All in all, it was a huge disappointment.
B00006LHYC|1.0|No,such a bunch of crap music is not possible on 1 record!!!!<BR>Laura used to sing good songs, she had a good voice,but now she is not even able to put out a decent song!I wonder why she lost every good thing she had?????????
B00020BVXI|1.0|This disc does NOT include the teaser trailer to the original Spider-man movie, as was stated elsewhere.  It is merely the teaser trailer for Spider-man 2.  <br />This is the most shameless &quot;make you buy a dvd you already have again&quot; scheme I have seen yet.  Sony doesn't even PRETEND that they're not ripping you off; they flagrantly flaunt that fact.  All of the additional features are on a whole extra disc, which has its own regular bulky dvd case, included in a slipcase with the EXACT SAME dvd you already have, in the EXACT SAME packaging!  It's a real middle finger to the fans.  If they had included this bonus disc packaged with the new Superbit version, then at least you'd be getting something new, not re-buying what you already have.  But no.  They don't even try to disguise the fact that they're re-selling you the same disc you bought a year and a half ago.  <BR>Furthermore, the bonus features on the third disc are meagre and not worth it.  The &quot;sneak preview&quot; of Spider-man 2 doesn't include any film footage you haven't already seen in the trailers.  <br />My one-star rating reflects this shameless new DVD re-packaging, not the movie itself, which is excellent and would receive five stars on its own.  <br />AVOID THIS DVD AT ALL COSTS IF YOU ALREADY HAVE THE ORIGINAL RELEASE!
B0000C7PSW|5.0|What a great album.  Rufus finally opens up the windows in his studio and lets some air into his production.  RW has always been a great songwriter, but some of his earlier stuff suffered because the production made the songs sound the same.  Not this time.  Want One is full of the great melodies we've come to expect, but the songs are just so much more alive here.  I wish this guy would get more popular.  We need people to buy his stuff so DreamWorks will keep producing it.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Much ado has been made about the fact that Avril Lavigne dumped The Matrix --- the songwriting team behind &quot;Let Go&quot; --- for her follow-up, &quot;Under My Skin&quot;.  Apparently a lot of critics are uncomfortable with a teenage girl singing anything besides lightweight, radio-friendly pop.  But as someone who's heard both &quot;Let Go&quot; and &quot;Under My Skin&quot;, I have to say that Lavigne made an excellent decision.  &quot;Skin&quot; is darker and angstier than its predecessor, mercifully free of bouncy ear candy like &quot;Complicated&quot;, &quot;My World&quot;, and the abominable &quot;Sk8r Boi&quot;.  The closest the new album comes to that sound is &quot;He Wasn't&quot;, a driving yet danceable piece that recalls the early Go-Go's (before the sugar-coated horror that was &quot;Vacation&quot;).  The rest of the album is decidedly edgier and more mature; Lavigne sounds so much like Alanis Morrisette on several songs you almost expect to see Morrisette's name in the credits.<br />Of course, not every song on the album is a winner.  &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot;, the track inexplicably chosen to be &quot;Skin&quot;'s first single, is a rather lackluster power ballad that doesn't quite live up to its fury-of-a-woman-scorned lyrics; when Lavigne warns her ex-boyfriend to respect her or she'll &quot;kick your a**&quot;, she sounds mildly miffed instead of righteously angry.  &quot;Slipped Away&quot;, which as far as I can tell is about a dead friend, is melancholy but unremarkable, and &quot;Freak Out&quot; veers dangerously back to the familiar territory from the first album.  Still, nine out of twelve isn't bad, since the rest of &quot;Skin&quot; has strong numbers like &quot;My Happy Ending&quot;, &quot;Forgotten&quot;, and the aforementioned &quot;He Wasn't&quot;.  &quot;Under My Skin&quot; is a great look at an artist maturing.  Add this one to your collection!
B0001VWP8I|5.0|Anastacia is finally back with this latest amazing album!All the songs on this record are worth the money you pay for,no stupid, awful, meaningless track,just very very good music!The style is SPROCK,which means rock mixed with a lot of genres,like pop,soul,funky and all these elements work amazingly together!<BR>Definetely a MUST-BUY record!!!!!!!!!
B000148KK2|5.0|All others: find comfort with the Standard menu.  <br />Original songs with lyrics that have a real purpose make this recording a surprise encounter.  The words paint vivid and specific images that made me pay attention to them.  Contrast this with the often-frivolous jazz lyric which serves mostly as a means to demonstrate \\"phrasing.\\"  The lyrics in this case belong to Krall/Costello, which tizzyfies some jazz scholars, upset with the infidel Costello's insinuating himself into the genre.  How silly.<br />But forget lyrics for now.  Melody-wise, Krall's writing is top notch: as imaginative and as grown-up as you'll find, musically appealing and never tiresome.  I can say this even after listening to the album almost daily for over a month and still going strong.  But that's just me.  The late Ray Brown, however, observed in his liner notes for one of Diana's early albums, \\"I find that there is a lot of soul inside this lady.\\"  Brown, of course, was only a legendary bassist, not your seasoned jazz aficionado, but Krall's writing proves he was on to something.<BR>  <BR>Sound quality is astonishingly clear and intimate as it is on all of her albums.  Krall's vocal style is somewhat \\"conversational,\\" with a pitch centered closer to normal speaking, exposing ever more shades of her gorgeous, unmistakable voice.  Most other singers don't have the vocal character to make this work and I suppose they have to jack up their volume to make up for it.  Krall doesn't quite get into piano pyrotechnics but the instrumental half of her talent is out in force.  Her solos and accompaniment are inspired and soulful; sometimes efficient and perfectly rendered (\\"I'm Pulling Through\\") and other times, ragged and muscular (\\"Love Me Like a Man\\").<br />Another reviewer nailed it:  Krall has hereby made Costello's \\"Almost Blue\\" a standard.  Beautiful, but too brief, Krall begins with a chord progression that morphs into an unexpected, awesome downbeat to begin the song.  In concert, this ischilling.  \\"Love Me Like a Man\\" has a big rockin,' blues sound, surprising for this kind of traditional four-piece band which is more suited to small jazz clubs.  \\"I've Changed My Address,\\" \\"The Girl in the Other Room \\" and \\"Abandoned Masquerade\\" are down-tempo and intense.  \\"I'm Pulling Through,\\" brightens the mood and Diana's exquisite arrangement of the tune would have made it a standout on any of her previous recordings featuring the Standards.  \\"Narrow Daylight\\" is hymn-like.  \\"Departure Bay,\\" gentle and beautiful, combines images of British Columbia with grief-tinged but hopeful images of life in the wake of the loss of her mother.  <br />Krall (and any other vocalist who ever had the poor judgment to lean up to a mic) has been knocked for vocals lacking passion, intensity, etc.  So who's more passionate and intense: somebody \\"interpreting\\" yet another Standard or someone singing her own work?
1400031354|5.0|It was a treat to discover The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency. I loved the first book in the series; Tears of the Giraffe is even better. This book gave me a very rare reading experience: Joy. I can't recommend it highly enough.
B00003CWPR|5.0|Do I have to order the film in Europe to see Kubrick's final masterpiece the way he wanted me to see it? Those censors can take their censure<BR>and shove it... You can blow up a guy's head, use the name of God to make bucks and get an PG-13 for satanic violence like in &quot;Lord Of The Rings&quot;. You can do all of this and more and still get an R-rated. What you can't do is show a woman naked! That's bad, that's obscene, that's immoral!  America should be the land of the free! The freedom of speech! The right to chose. So, why are we letting MPAA chose what's good and what's bad for us? I suggest a restoration of &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;,<BR>shown in its original unblurred version, the way the rest of the world sees it!
6305364648|5.0|For sheer appeal and entertainment, \\"TRUE LIES\\" surpasses any of the Terminator Series, Twins or really any other Schwarzenegger film.  It is about as perfect a movie as one could hope for - with all the action, humor, drama and sex appeal there is to offer.  Jamie Lee Curtis is absolutely incredible as the plain Jane wife who becomes entrapped in a world of espionage and shadows.  (The strip tease was one of the best scenes in filmdom ever.)  <br />Tom Arnold was also perfect for his role as the patient buddy spy who is the perfect cover. Tia Carrere was also perfect as the evil villaness with a flair for the upscale.  Whoever did the casting deserves a medal.  Dialogue, action, plot - I loved it all!
B0001UL7RY|5.0|this cd is the best yet.  can't wait to see what she does for her next album or even for the upcoming music videos.  i havent stopped listening to this cd since the day it came out.  if your an avril fan i suggest you go out and buy this cd today
B0000039LE|5.0|Halloween is a very scary movie. I really enjoy it with a very youing Jamie Lee Curtis.  I think that the plot was thought out and written good.  It may be considered boring and dumd in today's standards, but I think it tis one of the best movie's ever made
0553212621|4.0|Lady Chatterly's Lover is a philosophical novel that asks questions about values and what makes a good life.  In it, D. H. Lawrence considers the intellectual life and finds it arid and unreal.   (Here, there is an extended, unflattering discussion of the self-promotion that a successful writer must engage in.)  He then considers the effect of technology on modern life and finds that it has diminished our human qualities.  Finally, he advocates a return to a simpler life where people will meet their deeper needs rather than seeking the superficial things that money can buy.  The author thinks that sex has to play a pretty central role in a complete life, and he's probably right about that, but he has some very specific ideas about sex that sound odd to us now.   <br />The author also looks deeply into the dynamics of relationships between men and women and explores what we are like, why we have trouble understanding one another, and how men and women can complement one another.  <br />Finally, there is a fair amount of racy language and action that, of course, earned this book its notoriety.<br />I enjoyed this book a great deal and I think that the author's critique of modern ethics deserves some attention.  It is a mistake to dismiss this book because of its overtly sexual themes.
B00005JM0B|5.0|It's not so much Arnold/Terminator/Rescuer (take your pick) this time but John Conner and Claire Danes.  It is their story, how they met, how they react, how they will eventually end up - that you become enthralled with.  Kristanna Loken as the powerful, merciless bombshell of a Terminator is exquisite in her non-humanity and relentlessness.   <br />The ending was spectacular and, of course, leads to yet another sequel. Good performace by all involved.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|This cd rocks.  I haven't stopped listening to it since I bought it on the twenty fifth.  I reccomend that if you're reading this and your an Avril fan, that you should go out and by this cd today, it is great, even better than Let Go.  All the songs are awesome, and not as pop as the cd before.  This is the best cd of hers yet.

B0001NBMBC|4.0|Finally stopped doing stuff they werent capable of doing... and finally evolved from Nu-metal to pure Hardcore rock... exellent work. They can finally start building a road in the Hardcore sector, joining KoRn, Disturbed and others like Drowning pool. Perfect, I completly disliked Slipknot before this album, but now I started to like them... cool keep it up.
B0001AVZA8|4.0|...is that it seemed a little jumpy compared to AS Good As It Gets or many of Keaton's other movies (all heady to me), but the numerous funny scenes make up for it and Keaton's comic side is perfect until you hit the bedroom where I detected hints of an exaggerated Clooney and Pfeifer in One Fine Day and Hanks and Ryan in You've Got Mail.  Unlike other reviewers I don't find the younger lover totally unbelievable but they did fool me. I agree that McDormand was under used in this film.  Keaton seems to never let her characters really touch her emotionally (as in her Lifetime movie On Thin Ice) unlike Nicholson but the two balance each other out well in this movie.  I couldn't wait to see them together and I wasn't disappointed.  I must warn you, without spoiling the movie,that conservative Hollywood has decided to take a walk on the wild side!

His hobby refelects the state of his soul , dead as frozen as the animals of his collection&lt; the motel is awful and mysterious as his mind and his house.<br />Just remember there are twelve rooms available , but twelve is just the members of a jury.<br />And I think this is an underground clue given by the master Hichcock.<br />In the first take the camera flies and  sets us in a hotel window with Leigh, she commits adultery, and we are witness : then she steals the money and we are witeness again , so in the second part of the picture we just only establish Bates as the evil murder but we forget the opening sequence. In this sense I've always thought Norman acts as the judge sent by the fate.<br />The rest belongs to the legend. Norman Bates is an isolated guy and even more, a troubled man . The insights in the plot had a brittish ancestor: Peeping Tom, but Hitchcock never forgot the huge influence of the german expressionism and gives us unforgettable sequences. The handle camera , the support in music given by Bernard Hermann, made of this picture a landmark so hard to reach that still remains as a lone winner in the throne of the supreme jewels suspense american movies in any age.<br />Perkins in his best achievement.<br />An eternal cult movie.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|So, I guess shouting curses all of a sudden = real metal? You punks have been poisoned by bands like Korn, etc..and probably wouldn't know real metal if it bit ya. Heavy music has been in the same ugly rut for about 9 years or so, and any sort of change is a good thing.This album isn't really even that much of a departure, honestly...so what, they have a few acoustic tracks, or slightly more melody than before...it's still Slipknot. The guitars sound like all the other damn bands out there today, I don't see what the belly aching is all about. Don't you kids today love all your music to sound exactly alike anyway? You let the record companies force feed you all this crap and you eat it up like candy. We need to revolt against the major labels and not accept what they are selling us! It's time to get back to the underground! What Slipknot needs to do for their next album is radically change their sound and mess up everyone's heads...kill nu-metal forever. Remember the days when each metal band had their own distinctive sound?<br />I give this 4 stars because it's the best of their genre
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is fantastic ! I bought this dvd set because of viewer recommendations and I'm so glad I did! I find so few things really worth watching, but this I could watch repeatedly. The dialogue is humorous, gentle and engaging, while the characters face challenging and  often violent situations that test their strength and their characters. Not artificially sweet, willing to kill the bad guys where neccessary, and including twists and turn that leave you wondering, not predicting everything that is about to happen. Also, especially for a tv series, the special effects and the cinematography are consistently excellent throughout. The look is more big budget movie than small time tv. Buy it Now!!! You won't regret it. The only regret I have is that this is all there is. There were many more stories waiting to be told. Support the feature film too !
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I loved Avril's new cd, &quot;Under My Skin&quot;! She seems to have a whole new sound. The songs are incredible! Like always, she expresses what she feels. She comes straight out and sings what she thinks and how she feels. It is definately a lot more personal than other performers like to be. This cd doesn't have as much of a pop sound to it as her first one either. So if you like hear a girl rockin' out, this is the cd for you! This is definately her bets music yet!
B000001TVD|3.0|Lets get down to the heart of the matter: First, the song 'Maggot Brain&quot; is a musical testimonial which addresses the fact that African-Americans invented Rock &amp; Roll (Rock or whatever the latest name may be). <br />The work one this album is &quot;all over the place&quot; but it is still second to none. Futhermore, it has been well-respected outside of the U.S. since its original release.  Trust me when I tell you that many tried to suppressed it, denied it, but no one could kill it. It had also made many African-Americans uncomfortable because they too had been conditioned to believe that Rock music should not be played by their race. So, the recording was not that well-liked back in those days. <br />This album is great for so many resons. Maggot Brain really is the best rock guitar solo I ever heard. Just to own this song and is totally worth the price of the CD. <br />Also, I wish people would stop comparing Eddie Hazel to Jimi Hendrix. They both were great but very different in their approach to music.<br />One Last Point: The version played on the &quot;One Nation Under A Groove&quot; CD is called Maggot Brain-It Ain't Illegal, yet. This was there response to the first recording being silently banned from the American airwaves (Radio). <br />This is one of those listen and learn recordings! It's not a masterpiece but it is worth having.
B00004U2GH|5.0|GREAT CD, has most of his hits including &amp;quot;folsem prison blues&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;A Boy Names Sue&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Ring Of Fire&amp;quot; and more. With great live versions of all the songs. The only part that can get annoying is that since it is the full concert he can talk for a couple of minutes before he gets to the song.
B0001HLVS2|5.0|The year is 1805 and the British are in war with Napoleon, who rules over France and most of Europe.  This war is not only fought on land as what separates England and Europe is the English Channel.  There is also wealth and other items that can be retrieved from different continents around the world that could help each nation in the war.  In the middle of the war the HMS Surprise, a British frigate, whose captain, Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe), has been ordered to seek and destroy the French ship Acheron.  The story surrounds the quest of seeking to destroy this French vessel, which becomes a great adventure where Weir involves the audience by displaying all the different layers of  crew members on the HMS Surprise.  Nonetheless, the story focuses on two characters, Captain Jack Aubrey and the ship surgeon Dr. Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany).<br />Jack Aubrey is a resolute, yet understanding man who has served on the HMS Surprise ever since he was a early teenager.  Through years of experience Jack has learned to rely on his resourceful mind instead of taught naval strategy, which has kept the HMS Surprise afloat for many years.  Dr. Stephen Maturin is a freethinking scientist that has an infinite curiosity to learn new information or to make new discoveries.  These two men, also friends, contrast each other as they have different notions, which conflict with their interests.  There is one scene where Dr. Maturin studies the life and the complexity of life as the audience can hear Captain Aubrey's voice echoing in the background while laughing and chatting about memories of war.  This scene manage to display an analogy as it suggests the difficulty through which life is accomplished, and simultaneously, how easy one could destroy life.  This analogy serves is great example of how these two men complement each other and create an harmonious atmosphere on board a ship in war time.<br />Master and Commander is an engaging film on many levels as Peter Weir presents the composition of the crew through several sub plots that involve several different themes in a male dominated environment.  These themes provide much food for thought as they open many new doors.  The complexity to Weir's seafaring tale is of great depth as it portrays both a swashbuckling adventure and a philosophical dialogue, which any audience will enjoy on either a visual or cerebral level.  Lastly, the cast performs superbly and is supported by marvelous cinematography, which is blended with masterful directing.  This leaves the audience with a brilliant cinematic experience that has several lessons, which can be both interesting and educational for many generations.omposition of the crew through several sub plots that involve several different themes in a male dominated environment.

B000002J09|5.0|Good album, not as good as Led Zeppelin II but still worth 5 out of 5.  The best song is &quot;Black Dog&quot; but &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; also rocks. &quot;Rock and Rool&quot; is a classic.  Led Zeppelin is the greatest band ever.  Word to your mother.  This album really shows you how bad new, so-called &quot;Rock&quot; bands are.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|This cd is THE BEST! Songs 1 TO 12 are great. This girl can write songs. I have been an Avril Fan since day 1 and now she as sold alot of records. This cd is Avril. With Don't Tell Me as #3 the person who gets it can learn Take Me Away an Togther. But if u have been heart broken then Happy Endding is a song for you. But if the Person didn't treat u like u wanted then He wasn't is for you. Everysong someone can relate to. So get this albem u will be very glad u got it.
B00006DEFA|4.0|At first you would not think that an extended cut of this film would be really needed. I liked the original version well enough, but was not a fanatic like some fans of the film I know. With the directors cut I have a greater appreciation of the film. But not just from the extra scenes. Included are a great thirty minute behind the scenes look. That was made for the DVD and not some scraps of stock footage put together. Interviewing the key players of the cast. As well as the director, writer and producer, it tells what ordeals they had to go through to make the film. Including replacing Jennifer Tilly a week before shooting due to a torn ligament. Also why they chose to go with a standard american accents for both Mozart and Constanze wich I had always been curious about. Also you get a great audio commentary by Milos Foreman and Paul Schaffer that is well worth listening to and at times surprisingly funny. The chemistry between the two is really something.<br />The star attraction of the DVD, however, is the remastered sound. Even on my rinky dink TV it sounded great. As soon as I get a home theatre system, this is the first DVD I'm popping in. And I'm not really a fan of classical music. Also you get to see more of the amazing opera houses (not sets!) in the letterbox format.<br />This is definitly worth getting, for those who are fans. However I do not think it will change the minds of those who did not like the original version. A must for collectors and a well put together DVD.
B000060MMI|5.0|No, they aren't the Pogues. Nor should they be compared. Fact is, this band is good NOW. The Pogues were sounding a bit worn by the end... and one could say they sounded like a few well known traditional Irish bands of the day. FM has a great sound, fantastic lyrics, and I can't wait to see them live some time if they ever make it within 50 miles of my home. I'm 39, loved the Pogues, still do, and stubled onto FM while looking for something other than old Pogues cds to listen to. Thank god I found these guys and the Real McKenzies.
6304936362|4.0|This is the first of a line of movies depicting shear guts in the face of a real enemy.  Afterwards came the likes of Platoon, Saving Private Ryan, Thin Red Line, The Windtalkers, Blackhawk Down and We Were Soldiers.<br />Memphis Belle gets a bit schmaltzy in the beginning, focusing on the crew and not the reality, but the scenes of flying into the fire makes you respect the guts that generation displayed.<br />I really thought that using the actors (all around 21 to 25) was a great touch, and made me sit back and think about what I was doing at that age (Nam) and what my dad was doing (WWII).  Whew, take a bunch of amped up young men and throw them into harms way.  I wonder if older, more comfortable men would have done that?<br />And I thought flyboys had it easy.  Everyone directly engaged was slugging it out.  My Uncle used to say that the papers in WWII wouldn't focus on both fronts simultaneously, if the European campaigns were having a fight, the Pacific theator was talked about briefly or that the Marines were doing okay... he said that wasn't the case, everyone was fighting hard to stay alive, not just to win the war.  From the individuals perspective it was a matter of survival, not glory.  The glory came later.
B00001NFCY|5.0|If you haven't heard by now, Creed has disbanded.  They are no more and I am among the millions of mourners.  So now is the time to buy their CD's if you haven't already.  Human Clay is by far one of the best CD's ever made.  I have been an avid Creed fan since &quot;My Own Prison&quot; hit the radio waves and I didn't think their first album could be topped.  I found out just how dead wrong I was when I bought this album the day it came out.  It completely breaks my heart to know that I will never hear another Creed song again.  So I urge you all to pay homage to the Kings of New Rock and show Creed just how much we care and always will!  Buy this CD!  Long Live Creed!!!!!!!!!
B00005Y6YB|5.0|A made for T.V. mini series, a bit dated.  The book is GREAT.  This movie follows the book well (for a movie).  Lots of little mini-stories going on.  Lot's of popcorn opportunities here.  I like it, saw it on T.V., rented it on VHS and now I own it on DVD.  It's hit the bargin bin at Wally Mart, so you can get it there or here (for about the same price used).  Now's the opportunity.  Again... remember it's a made for T.V. mini series.<br />One thing... all these years it's been around I recently realized that Tommy Lee Jones was Capt Coll..  I couldn't believe I missed that. But I did.  It really sucks you in.  By the way, you have got to read the book if you never have. Then you will belong to the &quot;cult&quot; following.  I'm a big fan of Larry MacMurtry!
B0001ENYKS|3.0|Dear Archduke Franz Ferdinand:      Tomorrow night I will be treated to an evening of live music from the most hyped new band on the planet. You've been dead for almost 90 years, I know, but here's the deal:      Using some socially ambiguous lyrics on a bed of fresh, twisted mix of new-wave-y sheen and gritty dance-hall punk rock, four Scots have released an insanely likable, catchy album under your name. The first hit single du jour is about a man so heartbroken and desolate that he urges his lover to &quot;Take Me Out.&quot; Other tracks feature topics like dancing with Michael (apparently the greatest Scottish dancer of all time), poison darts of pleasure, and the financial implications of the attitude embodied in the following quote from the album-opener, &quot;Jacqueline&quot;:      &quot;It's always better on holiday...so much better on holiday. That's why we only work when we need the money.&quot;      Since Franz Ferdinand has gathered momentum and miraculously risen to temperatures not seen since the Strokes, suddenly, they no longer need the money, but thankfully, the band is still working, and hopefully, it will avoid meeting your kind of unfortunate end and can continue making music for the free world.       In the meantime, you can continue to rest in peace knowing that all kinds of music fans who snoozed through high school history will know who you are, why you were assassinated, and most importantly, your death's ultimate role in the incitement of World War I.
B000050FEN|4.0|Whew,  this was a heavy flick.  The use of environment, really helped set the tone.  Rain, dark, overcast (except for the ending) You've read the reviews, the synopsis... what more can be said?  The first REALLY freaky movie I ever saw was the original Texas Chainsaw movie...  Seven is on steriods.

B000068TPN|5.0|A true war story and a good movie about a bunch of guys tuffing out bad policy in the battlefield.  Luckily the leader of this &quot;exercise&quot; was a skilled in tactics.  Great book by the way.  There are a couple of traditional Mel Gibson moments...  you know, the attempts at wrenching the hearts of the viewers by getting a bit sappy, but the 'Nam scenes are skillfully done and show what great leadership Hal Moore really exercised.  He (Hal Moore) cared and he shed blood with his brothers in arms.  And many men will hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks that fought with us during those bloody days.
0671027573|5.0|If you're looking for a laugh-out-loud romance packed with sex appeal and suspense then this is for you.  OK, so the plot is slightly unbelievable (particularly if you read a lot of crime books) and the villain may as well carry a signpost around their neck with the words `QUIET PLEASE - SERIAL KILLER AT WORK', but cracking dialogue and fantastic characters more than make up for these problems.<br />Jaine Bright is just about the only heroine I've ever read who manages to come across as zany and spontaneous without also being wimpy and irritating.  Jaine holds down a good job, has a great car and house, and is an independent woman happy with her life.  Cue Sam Donovan, a sexy, muscular cop who happens to be her next-door neighbour and you know that you're reading Linda Howard at her best.  When a killer targets Jaine and her friends it is up to Sam to protect them and track down the villain.<br />The chemistry between Jaine and Sam is great and the use of humour is so funny in places that you can't help but burst out laughing.  There are some incredibly risqué innuendos which are just fantastic, my favourite was when Sam walks into the kitchen when Jaine and her sister Shelley are preparing a cucumber to use on Jaine's eyes.  The plot bounces along at a fairly fast rate but I felt the crimes really acted as a backdrop for the romance, as Jaine and Sam find various excuses for getting `to know each other better'.<br />Overall Mr Perfect is a funny and romantic novel with a great ending and likeable characters.  You can't really take it seriously as a crime novel, but who cares when the book is such a perfect blend of suspense and romance?<br />JoAnne
B000065U1N|5.0|Do you like a war movie... how about one which portrays a real incident, at a time when the President certainly was playing chess with devoted men's lives.  Those guys were fighting for themselves, they knew that the white house wasn't backing them up.  Excellent, realistic, sadly true. A reflective moment in the ugly history when silly leaders ruled the U.S.
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|Length of Play - 33:40<BR>I don't know where the ultra negative reviews are coming from, because &quot;Room on Fire&quot; certainly isn't anything to scoff at. Sure, it's nothing really new from The Strokes and sounds more or less the same as &quot;Is This It?&quot;, but honestly, is that a bad thing? I don't think so. The driving basslines, highly danceable hooks and fuzzy vocals are all still went intact. It's understandable that a follow up album riding on the vaunted novelty of it's preceding sound will garner far less encomium, but as far as I'm concerned, the wonderful, neoretro rock from &quot;Is This It?&quot; is far from played out, and I wouldn't mind hearing five more albums from The Strokes with a similar groove. The bottom line is that these guys have a sensational sound, and although the newness of their appeal has withered slightly, they still sound great. My favorite tracks are Reptilia, Automatic Stop and Between love and Hate. If you liked &quot;Is This It?&quot;, you definitely should check out &quot;Room On Fire&quot;.
B00005V9IL|2.0|The Abyss single disc edition is a cool movie, but the actual movie is not in Dolby 5.0 as Amazon.com or Dolby 5.1 as the DVD jacket would have us believe, but only in Dolby 2.0 (2 channel) English or French. I tried both the theatrical and the special edition cut, same result.<br />Buyer beware.
B00001NFCY|5.0|Yes, Creed has announced their disbanding today the 6th of June 2004. Sadly the band will be missed. Now here is my letter to all of the haters who prefer to listen to Pearl Jam. <br />Hey, all you haters,<BR>WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME PEARL JAM MADE A NEW ALBUM? WHAT, 2001?! YEAH, DID IT SELL? NO! CREED SOLD MORE THAN PEARL JAM'S THAT YEAR! EVEN THOUGH WEATHERED WAS THEIR WORST, CREED WAS A HECK OF A LOT BETTER THAN PEARL JAM'S LATER STUFF. AND TO THE REVIEWER WHO SAID THAT THE VOCALS SOUNDED LIKE STAPP CLEARING HIS THROAT, I'D LIKE TO HEAR YOU SING! BETCHA WILLIAM HUNG CAN SING BETTER THAN YOU! <br />Okay, I'm done with the lashing out. Fans that don't have all the albums, will be able to buy a greatest hits CD coming out in 2004, according to Creed's website. Also, Tremonti and the drummer are in a new band who's CD is coming out in August. <br />R.I.P. Creed<BR>1996-2004<br />I was hoping for a new CD!
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Avril Lavigne's new album is so good. I've had it on repeat ever since I bought it. I've liked Avril since she first came out and as much as I liked her before, I have to say that she has definitely made a lot of improvement in her music. In Under My Skin, she had much more say in her songs, taking the lead role in the writing or co-writing with other people (including Chantal Kreviazuk, Ben Moody, and her guitar player, Evan Taubenfeld, just to name a few). Every song on the album is personal to her and you can definitely hear the emotion in her voice. She's more mature now and still expressing her true self like always. If you haven't checked this album out already, you definitely should.
B000002L68|5.0|This is one of my favorite records now and when it came out. Prince is a great singer/songwriter, one of the world's best, if I may say so myself. This was Prince's highest selling album, and I can see why. While some other of Prince's releases may seem not my style, this one shows that Prince is one of pop/rock's greatest stars. Adding equal amounts of pop, rock, and funk, Prince shows off his talent. Although this record may seem extremely 80's at first listen, it really is one of those timeless ones, like the Beatles 'Revolver' or Ratt's 'Out Of The Cellar'.
B00005A46T|5.0|To me Slipknot made this album to improve upon the self titled CD. Everything or almost everything here is just a repeat of the first album but has been changed and worked off from and getting ideas from. The self titled album was a classic and Slipknot's main objective for this album was to build on the sh*t they had going from that. Heavy, dark, obscene, chaotic. I dont like labelling these guys to anything..Nu Metal, Metal, Death Metal etc. They are something on its own, like a machine that comes into this world with pissed off emotions and telling the world whats on their minds. This isn't the heaviest stuff by any means, but it is something that will and Should NOT be done again in the future, because nothing will ever be like Slipknot, and Corey<br />1.(515) --------- Alright, for an opener it's original, spookey and really sends the message that their not going to be messing around on this one..(9/10) <BR>2.People=Sh*t ------- Tremendous. Catchy at beginning. Trade mark slogan of Slipknot..(10/10)<BR>3.Disasterpiece ----- Amazing. Great opening riff and chorus timing and orchestration.. (10/10)<BR>4.My Plague --------- Excellent. a bit overplayed, but i love the heavy guitar crushings in the verse.. (10/10)<BR>5.Everything Ends ----- Great. sing-along, heavy, generation inspirational... (9/10)<BR>6.The Heretic Anthem ---- Great. verses are kinda plain to me for some reason, but has a revolutionary chorus and scariness..(9.5/10)<BR>7.Gently ------ Great. old song, cool soft build up to punishing guitar, longer and experimental ...(8/10) <BR>8.Left Behind ---- Great. radio, cool 80's flare near end.. (9/10)<BR>9.The Shape ---- Great. reminds me of Surfacing for some reason, but same, good chorus... (9/10)<BR>10.I Am Hated ---- Good. Doesnt come across clean... (7.5/10)<BR>11.Skin Ticket ---- Good. Dont consider it a real song but i find it enjoyable sometimes when i feel alone and insane.. (8/10)<BR>12.New Abortion --- Good. nothing special. (8/10)<BR>13.Metabolic ---- Great. underrated-- (9/10)<BR>14.Iowa ---- Boring. Long. Same as \\"Killers Are Quiet\\". Enjoyable when you are not hyper to any extent what-so-ever ... (5/10)<br />Album Description === CHOATIC<br />great work, revolutionary CD. pick it up if your VERY angry.
B000089RVX|1.0|if ya only knew how much i hate this album, you would be knocked down with all the hate. how dare amy lee and her pack of hoodlums run around making this garbage music. if this was released in the good old days of hard rock, it wouldn't sell a stinking copy. how dare they name the band something so silly and fluffy. how dare they win the best new band grammy. the best new band should not be them. more like the most overrated, disgusting, silly, worst band of the year.
B000069HK2|4.0|The Used, wow. This CD absolutely blew me away, its different and has a variety of many genres including, relative punk, rock, hard rock, screamo, emo. This band somewhat sounds like a relatively good radio friendly band at times, however, i never even heard of them until a couple of months ago and have wondered where these guys have been. The guitars here are quite good and so is the rest of the band. I am generally into heavy music, but whenever i come across a band that seems very new and revolutionary..i acknowledge them no matter what genre (always in Rock to Death metal cultures) <BR>These guys are unique and the one guy that really stands out among anyone is of course Bert McCracken. This guy is a God!. He is one Tremendous singer and as many fans may know, Bert has one of the most powerful and intense screams out there. Whenever this guy plays a live show he (Bert) vomits onstage due to all the emotion of the screaming done. McCracken is also one of the most emotional singers i've ever heard. He is very unique and is very talented when it comes to song writing. His lyrics are just outstanding on this debut album, and somewhere down the line when The Used gets popular (probably) people will go bck, buy this album and then people will really notice what the hell this band started and created from. <BR>To me this is the best debut album of all time, i Still cant stop listening to this. All songs are worth listening the whole album through for. <BR>I DO give this band 4.5/5 stars on the album, ONLY because i REally think that the next album they make will be alot better and will truely be the breakthrough of greatness for this band.<br />Songs:<br />1.Maybe Memories --9.5/10<BR>2.The Taste Of Ink -- 9.5/10<BR>3.Bulimic --9/10<BR>4.Say Days Ago --10/10<BR>5.Poetic Tragedy --9/10<BR>6.Buried Myself Alive --8.5/10<BR>7.A Box Full Of Sharp Objects --11/10. WOW, original. The Used<BR>8.Blue And Yellow --10/10. Beautiful piece.<BR>9.Greener With The Scenery --8/10<BR>10.Noises And Kisses --9/10<BR>11.On My Own --9/10<BR>12.Pieces Mended --9/10<BR>*13.Choke Me --9.5/10<br />I really think The Used have i tremendous future in making the style of music that they have showcased on this for sure, epic adventure of true beauty in music. <BR>I only hope that poor Bert McCracken will not become an addict again. Because either he does that, or he'll probably commit suicide from self inflicted wounds. Sadly that seems possible because he is an emotional, battled, lost and crazy person. He says, the music saved his lif, well Bert, keep doing what ur doing....DONT SELL OUT.
B00020HEG6|5.0|what was the title of the song used when they where in lining up to face the boggarts? Lupin played this kinda jazzy music. Anyone know the song?
B00006BTCA|3.0|I walked into the record store to purchase this album expecting the voice of God to enlighten me and save me forever thanks to all the hype this album recieved.  <br />Obviously I was disappointed, no divine guitar solos here.  Just simple layered guitars and a singer who sounds like he missed the Talking Heads audition by a few notes.  I'm trying to say, don't buy the hype.  Its a decent album, &quot;Stella is a Diver...&quot; is a great track so are the 'Obstacles', but I don't see what's revolutionary or particularly unique about this album.  Check out any rock band formed in the 80s and you'll find a similar guitar pattern and singing style.  <br />All in all a good retro vibe album, but no guest tracks with God (Don't buy the hype on this one).
0553573403|4.0|Fantasy novels are a good break from here and now. Most are ok, but hardly memorable. \\"A Game of Thrones\\" was different, by first chapter's end, I knew so. It turned out to be a really good book.<br />Why? One, I find fantasy too often employs magic, monsters, and the supernatural to cover for poorly contrived story lines. This story is tight, and comes across as realistic, and exciting.<br />Martin also does a good job with his characters. Good, bad, or amoral (possibly all but a handful approach the latter), they are colorful and have clear motivations (my favorite is \\"the Imp\\"). None are safe from misfortune - even cute kids.<br />Finally, you get plenty of fighting, but not so overly detailed that it seems a fantasy version of \\"World Military History 301.\\" There's also a good deal of intrigue, aristocratic politics, and romance (or sex). Magic? Hardly at all, although several dragons are hatched towards the end, so maybe it gets a slight bit more fanatical in book 2.<br />I seldom recommend books, and almost never buy them new. Made an exception for \\"Game of Thrones,\\" and hope you enjoy this book also. Have a great day!
B000089CJI|4.0|A very interesting mixture of electronic beats and riffs accompanied by soft subtle 'emo' vocals.  A good combination, this coming from a fan that can't stand emo in its purest form (ex. Dashboard Confessional, Death Cab for Cutie(I am aware that is the band that made this project possible), and others).  But this album has a special air about it.  The coldness of the computer generated beats seems to only contrast the vocals even more making the singer stand out on an emotional twig rather than an emotional limb.  Highly recommended for fans of electronica or &quot;Emo&quot;   Techmo lives
B00005QDW1|4.0|This album has more of a dance feel then Tragic Kingdom (the only other ND album I have) but this album is good.<br />1.Intro-It's a 27 second intro, starts the same way as Rock Steady (13th track) and I think this should've been an interlude for rock steady. 10/10<br />2.Hella Good-Probably my favorite song.  This is getting played on certain stations a lot, but this is still a good song. 9/10<br />3.Hey Baby featuring Bounty Killer-This is the 1st single and it's a REALLY good song.10/10<br />4.Making Out-The chorus gets old fast, but the verses are nice. 8/10<br />5.Underneath It All- 2nd single, and it's an ok song.  7/10<br />6.Detective-Awesome song! 10/10<br />7.Don't Let Me Down-This song just gets really dull. 6/10<br />8.Start The Fire-This song is so BORING!  2/10<br />9.Running-Sweet. 8/10<br />10.In My Head-Better then 'Running'. 10/10<br />11.Platinum Blonde Life-This song is awesome, even though I'm not blonde! 10/10<br />12.Waiting Room-Boring. 4/10<br />13.Rock Steady-GREAT song. 9/10<br />113/130=4 stars
B00006CXXU|5.0|No other pop diva has gone this far! Christina shows her maturity and versatility on this album. I can listen to this album from START to finish (except for &quot;Make Over&quot; of course). This album is deep and goes into MANY moods. Christina's smokey voice melts over each track like butter (except for &quot;Make Over of course). Sorry for the cliché's, but this is one of the bests in my album collection. Kudos to Xtina for a job WELL DONE!<br />TOP THAT BRITNEY!
6305428050|5.0|ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING is a wonderfully entertaining film from the late eighties that still resonates almost 20 years later.  Chris Columbus (the future director of the first two Harry Potter films) brings us a series of vignettes resulting in Elizabeth Shue's Chris Parker babysitting for the precious Maia Brewton and the mooneyed Keith Coogan.  Shue is marvelous; Coogan and Anthony Rapp are delightful; and little Maia is appropriately cute and loveable.  Penelope Ann Miller as the nearsighted Brenda is a riot...especially when she picks up a stray &quot;cat&quot; at the bus station.<br />Of course, the primo scene is the &quot;nobody leaves till you sing the blues&quot; with Albert Collins.  Shue's transformation as she gets into the &quot;Babysitter Blues&quot; is priceless.<br />This is one feel good movie, and in spite of some of its profanity, a film everyone should enjoy.<br />It's a minor classic to me!!!
0375414053|5.0|This book kept me laughing. The main character is honest, fun, and witty. But she is not the average working mother. She is an extremely busy and successful businesswoman that can afford a lot of things an average mother would not easily afford. But at the same time, she has the same troubles at home, at the office, trying to do a million things at the same time, and feeling guilty for things she just does not have time for.  <br />I must say the part that really touched my heart was the day she comes home from work, and finds her kids happily cuddled up with their nanny, gets a bit jealous and realizes that she is actually paying some other woman to have these happy moments with her kids... <br />The book is a good example of the stay at home mother versus working mother dilemma.
B00000AFGM|5.0|This is the album that made so many listeners drop their headphones just because it didn't sound like antichrist superstar. Yes, superstar is an amazing album, but get over it. This album is also an amazing album, just in a different way. Manson is expanding his view of music and art, something we should all be open to. In the style of David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust, Manson becomes Omega and continues the journey of the antichrist begun in the album before. This is actually a prequel to Antichrist Superstar. The plot is pretty complex so I won't go into it, but basically it shows the rise of a rock star as he looks at his world corrupted by drugs and government mind washing. This is showed perfectly in every song. \\"The Dope Show\\" is a glam masterpiece perpetuating the theme that we've all become mindless zombies. One of the most interesting songs on the album is \\"Speed of Pain\\" which boasts a haunting tune and great lyrics. When Manson sings \\"I want to sleep, but I can't lay on my back because there's a knife for every day that I've known you,\\" you know this is a man that knows the pain of drugs. The ironically fun \\"I Don't Like the Drugs but the Drugs Like Me\\" is full of glamour but also is chucked full of Manson's anger at the world and christianity. The only problem with this album is it comes a bit to close to becoming repetative and noisy in the middle. With songs like \\"New Model 15\\" and \\"User Friendly\\" back to back it almost makes you want to turn the radio down. But that's the only flaw. The song \\"The End of the World\\" explains exactly what it says and the final song \\"Coma White\\" is an extemely sad and poignet expression of exactly what the album states. If you can get over the fact it's not antichrist superstar, you'll realize this album has so much to offer. It's not his best, but it's probably my favorite. Give in to the glam and sadness and give it a listen. You'll be doing yourself a favor.
B000001ESF|4.0|Reading a review of 2112 I saw Rush referred to as &quot;nerdy&quot; - I never thought about it that way, but they really encapsulate nerdiness. This album (hey - this one will always be an &quot;album&quot;...) also proves that nerds usually know exactly what they are doing. Sure, there are heavier, louder, faster rock albums out there (even Neil Young's work can be heavier than Rush) but there isn't anything, anywhere, that so totally stretches out the boundaries of rock &amp; roll like this album. Pink Floyd and King Crimson certainly have their own areas of dominance, but Rush managed to create the ultimate overblown, ridiculously narcissistic head-trip ever with 2112... but it WORKS. There is an exhuberance and energy in this music that is rare in prog-rock... it seems these guys were having fun...<br />Then again, nerds tend to be people having a lot of fun in their own inside-joke sort of way. 2112 is exactly that.<br />By the way, it is a technically awesome, eminently listenable album. It does grow on you. I really never appreciated 2112 until Rush's tour back in 2001 when they played the entire set live. That was something to behold...
B000001Y2U|5.0|Here it is. THe definitive Marilyn Manson classic. No matter what those protesters say, this is music at its best. This is the album that caused so much controversy and spun off a million rip off bands. Antichrist Superstar is the story of a rock star who has sought to change the world and ended up making it worse, therefore deciding to destroy himself. It is a viscieral amazing journey into music that not only encompasses metal, but is gothic beauty at its best. The album starts with \\"Irresponsible Hate Anthemn\\", a ravaging song full of exactly what the title suggests. Other notables are \\"Dried Up Tied Up and Dead to the World\\" perhaps the most tuneful song that has great lyrics. The title track is a powerful army-like war song that will have you banging your head in no time. Always as the best of Manson's albums though, are there strangely eery yet beautiful songs such as \\"Cryptochild\\", \\"Kinderfeld\\" and the absolutely sad and beautiful \\"Man that You Fear\\". Of course \\"Beautiful People\\" is on here too along with plenty of other tracks to fill your hungry ears. This album lives up to all the hype and exceeds it. It is an amazing piece of concept art that does what few concept albums can. IT tells a story clearly and interesting without getting bogged down with details. Many people pass it off as a moronic album that promotes satanism. That's completely untrue. If you simply take the time to listen to the lyrics you'll find an amazing tale of one angry man disappointed with himself and the world.
1592400876|5.0|This is a surprisingly fun to read grammar book. Normally, you would not expect a grammar book to be so much fun to read.   This is an unique work.   Lynne Truss is a great writer of intelligent humor.     As one who has gotten sick and tired of seeing elementary grammar mistakes in the daily newspapers, I heartily recommend this book.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|avril's new album Under My Skin is even better than the last.  the songs are less bubbly and a bit more mature in general.  Tracks such as My Happy Ending leave you to press the replay button over and over.  this album is a must!
B000089RVR|5.0|I love Dido. No Angel is an album that I totally connected with, it had so much meaning at that time of my life, which I'll admit was not so happy at the time, but certain songs gave me the lift to make a change (Hunter, for one). Life for Rent is different, she created it to be smooth from start to finish, the perfect road trip cd, which is exactly how it plays, it's always our choice on road trips. My husband also loves Dido now, and we recently saw her perform in Hollywood. Her voice was flawless, the band was great and the interaction perfect. We didn't want it to end! She sounded even better in person. She explained how different songs came to being, and that was interesting as well. I'll share one thing with you, because I see all the misinterpretations on other reviews of the song \\"don't leave home\\" This song is about addiction and drugs, it has nothing to do with another person or lover. Now that you know that, when you listen to the song again it will make a whole new world of sense. \\"Hold my hand\\" is about her first sexual experience (not the very first, but during her sexual awakening as a teenager). I love Dido's lyrics and the sounds of the music, the tone and the vibe. I also love how honest she is, she sets aside her ego and just lays it on the line. Things I feel but certainly wouldn't admit to the world, she blurts out without abandon. It's nice to hear another woman admit she's angry, jealous, possesive, giving, loving, open minded, etc. Like real people her moods shift, reverse, and get contridicted from song to song. She doesn't paint a perfect picture of relationships or her life in her songs, and doesn't apologize for it either, and that's much more honest than the pop b.s. that's out there. My husband simply listens to the music and sounds of the songs, doesn't pay attention to the lyrics, and completely enjoys it, while I listen the the words and the vibe. We both have different reasons for loving her, which makes it great to pop into the cdplayer when we're off on an hour long drive to the beach, we both can groove to it and be completely wrapped up in it for different reasons. My 2 year old daughter loves dancing to the beat also! I'll keep buying her albums and going to her concerts until she's retired. Her voice is timeless and the band is progressive that they will always be ahead of the \\"scene\\".
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|While some find this movie strange, I found it quite touching.  Yes, it is about fathers and sons and families and the way they hold things together with stories of various kinds.  And yes, each of us has more in our lives than even those closest to us really know as they have more than we can ever know.<br />Is it a great movie?  I don't think so.  However, I think it is a very good movie.  It never does come down on the hard edge of what all of this really means in each of our lives.  The movie seems to think it is enough to wrestle a bit with the way lies, poetry and truth fit together.  Well, that really isn't enough for a great work of art.  I did enjoy the poetry of it all and visually the movie is breathtaking.  But in a way it is cold in the way a post card is colder and more impersonal than your own snapshot even though it is many times more beautiful than what you were able to produce.<br />We really don't get into these people terribly deeply except in one extraordinary scene where Ed and Sandra Bloom (Albert Finney and Jessica Lange) are in the bathtub in their clothes.  It is an amazingly truthful and achingly touching scene with barely a word being said about what is being communicated between them.<br />Ewan McGregor does a fine job as the young Ed Bloom and Billy Crudup's portrayal of the son, Will Bloom, learning that reality isn't quite as cut and dried as he had always thought.  It was wonderful to see Robert Guillaume again.  He does a fine job as the family doctor and has an important scene teaching Will Bloom a bit about the difference between facts and truth.<br />There are many other fine performances and I don't want to come across as being down on the movie.  I liked it a lot.  I just think there was one more level the director could have taken the movie to make the movie important instead of just touching and at times quite funny.  But by all means, see it.
B00000269W|5.0|Very Cool Miles<br />The Miles Davis I listen to most, after Kind of Blue. All time best recordings of Round Midnight and Blackbird. You feel like Miles is there in the room with you, Harmon mute and all. You feel his loneliness, melancholy and great joy. Communicates true emotion like no other Miles recording.<br />Miles Davis first record with a major label.<br />The SACD is even better.<br />I can't understand why this doesn't sell better?
0790731509|5.0|This is the perfect `60s movie.  It is anti-authoritarian without being strident, a serious drama with whimsy, gritty and violent with a sexy side (who can forget the car wash scene?).  Newman plays the \\"christ\\" figure and his prisoners as his disciples and believers (after he wins them over).  The guards and the warden are the high priests and the Romans.  And of course, they kill him in the end.<br />But we have some great fun along the way.  Luke strips the heads off of a street of parking meters and gets a sentence far out of proportion to such a silly crime.  To say that Luke chooses not to fit in is an understatement.  It isn't that he takes on the system. Rather, his mere presence and indifference to the system causes it to change or to try and eliminate him as if he were some invading virus.<br />There are some wonderful and indelible scenes such as the egg eating, the fight with Dragline (George Kennedy), the race to the end of the road, the failure to communicate scene and the severe punishment Luke receives.  It seems like you can sit around talking about scenes from this movie longer than the movie itself.<br />Paul Newman made Luke immortal, but George Kennedy as Dragline and Strother Martin as Captain are also essential to this movie's character and permanence.<br />Today's viewers might fine the pacing of the movie a bit slow and see some seams that those of us who love it might ignore, but so what?  It is a classic and enjoyable film that is a touchstone for many who were young when they first saw it in 1967.
B00003XAQ5|5.0|Having listened to the SACD version on a high resolution stereo, all I can say is 20 years ago when we started buying CD's, we were sold a load of bull -  &quot;perfect sound forever&quot;??? This recording will show you what has been missing from conventional CD's.<br />Compare this SACD with the CD version, there is much more bits!!! from 16 to 24 samples on the y axis (or 2 to the 8th power more bits), from 44k to 196k on the x axis (4 times more samples). It sounds like real music. It sounds like the LP - I can't tell the difference from the LP, but its worlds better than the CD version, more precise, more accurate, highs are sweet and non fatigueing, bass is detailed but not muddy, much higher dynamic range; midrange is effortless and smooth. Image is more three dimensional, yes three dimensional, without using non-musical midfi gimmicks like &quot;surround sound&quot; or 5 channel.<br />What we hear on the CD version, on all CD's, is a fuzzy approximation, like a thick blanket over the speaker. Like a black and white picture in a newspaper made up of dots. And you and I have gotten used to this distortion for 20 years.<br />But, and this is important, I'm sorry to say if you have the same speakers and stereo you had twenty years ago, you will probably not hear most of the music that's really there. Huge improvments have been made in hi fi in the last twenty years. A quality hi fi stereo reproduces sound in three dimension space with two speakers because it accurately reproduces the soundstage around the instruments and the players in the recording studio!<br /><br />LP's had the real sound, and this sounds as good as the LP. Or the master tape.<br />Wonderful music. hear it for the first time. I know I did.
B00005JLYW|1.0|While Bernie Mac gets in a few funny lines and Demi Moore chews the scenery like a rabid Bette davis, this film is just a complete blunder!<br />Drew Barrymore and her horrible lisp, Cameron Diaz as the dancing retarded angel and Lucy Loo not doing much of anything. Also, wasn't that irish guy completely annoying and had a horrid accent? The humor was just BLAH. Helen Zass anyone?<br />This film also tried to rip off others...Matrix, Cape Fear, etc.<br />Just bad....very, very bad!

I saw teh reading sceduale for people who were reading it along with the Oprah book club and discovered I was way ahead. This is by far one of the best books I have ever read. I wonder what Oprah has instore for the next selection. She knows good books.Two other books that I recommend are \\"Anna Karenina\\", and \\"He Never Called Again.\\"
B00005PJ6M|5.0|I love this movie. It's very funny, it has references to metal bands, and it's kinda like Terminator with the evil robots from the future. Terminator Bill and Ted! I think that could have worked besides Evil Robot Bill and Ted.  Terminator is also a good movie. Buy that and this movie. Ha ha.  I've watched this thing eighteen times since I bought it.  <BR>It's funny because a lot of the times Bill and Ted look like they are so stoned in the movie with their facial expressions and valley talk.  And it if you smoke, watch this movie under the influence.  You won't be disappointed.  <BR>This movie is also touching and has a message; Treat people nicely and don't judge them.  &quot;Be excellent to each other!&quot;  It's just flat out a good movie guys.
B00005B36H|5.0|It's kind of hard to articulate my feelings toward this album. It's just so damn good. I mean, Aenima is great, but this is transcendental. For whatever reason, Lateralus seems considerably more cohesive than Tool's other releases. There's just the eerie, psychedelic, ethereal tone to the whole thing. You can feel it in every song. <br />If you're familiar with other Tool albums, I should tell you that the lyrics on this one are even better. They tackle universal, important subjects like communication, the sacredness of life, and really just spirituality in general.<BR>Instrumentation seems even more solid than on Aenima, although I am too musically ignorant to really explain how. Just listen and you can decide for yourself.<br />The songs are even longer this time around, most of them being over seven minutes long. For this reason, this probably is not the album for beginning Tool listeners. I would recommend starting with with either Undertow (shorter songs) or Aenima (just plain cool songs). The songs on this album are less aggressive than those on other Tool albums, and they meander more, so it's very easy to grow bored if you're not accustomed to Tool's stylings. But if you give it time, you'll love it. <br />The songs on this album are so consistently good that it is hard to choose favorites, but I'll name a few: The Patient, Schism, Parabol/Parabola, and Reflection. The Patient has great lyrics and a really dreamy beginning. Schism has awesome bass. Parabol/Parabola I regard as a single song as one can not be listened to without the other. Parabol is slow and mellow, but a bit creepy, while Parabola is perhaps the hardest rocking track on the album. Reflection typifies the trippiness of Lateralus. It's eleven minutes long, but it floats by pretty fast.<br />This is an album I can not live without, but I recommend it only for those who have listened to and like Tool already. It would probably be a waste for anyone else.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Avril's new CD really shows that she's matured since Let Go was released in 2002. Under My Skin a more hard rock than Let Go but there are still soft songs on it. Overall the CD is very good, lyric wise and musically. There are thriving bass lines and guitar riffs which quality drumming. The CD overall is very good and is a must own!
B00000099Y|5.0|This is one of the best albums I have ever heard, although I should confess that I don't listen to the widest variety of music. This is actually not Tool's best album (that honor goes to Lateralus), but I like it so much that I'm forced to give it a five anyway. <br />The reviewer below me said that Tool's lyrics are stupid and pretentious(&quot;Some of the worst lyrics ever written,&quot; apparently). This is off the mark, to put it mildly. I'm not sure what this guy's been listening to, but I think the lyrics in Aenima are some of the best in rock music. One nice thing is that it takes a while to understand any of them, and once you do, there are many ways they could be interpreted. This may not sound great, but it definitely adds to the album's longevity.<BR>Instrumentally, Tool is about as good as they come. The sounds always seem to match the lyrics, and the whole package comes together very nicely. <br />Another reviewer says that Aenima should be an EP, since it only has seven songs and a whole lot of filler. Well, in actuality there are nine songs, and the filler pieces(some of which are pretty cool) only amount to about fifteen minutes in an album which is one hour and fifteen minutes long. Good luck selling an hour-long disc as an EP.<br />All nine songs are pretty cool, too. This is definitely an album you should listen to all the way through without skipping. Highlights are Stinkfist, Eulogy, Forty Six and 2, Aenema, and the 13-minute masterpiece, Third Eye. I would recommend listening to the album a few times at least before you form a judgment on it. Songs as long as these seem overlong and sometimes boring before you get used to them. It took me a while to appreciate Tool, but it has been worth the time I've put into it; it's hard to imaging more rewarding music.<br />This is a definite must-buy.

B0001NBMBC|4.0|Okay, so anybody out there who digs Slipknot and is looking at this, probably already owns this, but if you don't, DEFINITELY get it! This CD is a departure from previous albums of this band, but it retains all the previous elements that drew me into the band in the first place: Style, format, and surprises. This band continues to impress and grow beyond what I thought they were initially capable of- the only reason this CD is not a perfect score is (I feel) that there are a few weak tracks, that is to say, they don't contain quite the same polish as classic Slipknot. On another note, the CD's lyrics and acoustic (yes, four acoustic tracks!) are absolutely inspiring, and don'e seem silly or sold out even when performe by these masters of metal.<BR>CHECK IT OUT!!!
B0001AP12G|3.0|This had to have been the most overhyped cd of the year. Kanye West has a couple clever lines out of all his songs, and his production is good, not great like people overhype it to be. Kanye has an extremely WEAK flow, that destroys the entire album. Most people are just following the hype that has been created around Kanye, being on Roc-A-Fella alone is enough for people to hype him up. Real rap music fans, stay away from this, and stay away from 95% of mainstream garbage.
9995580675|5.0|Definitely a great fantasy epic and one of my personal favorites, The Chronicles Trilogy- Dragons of Autumn Twilight, Dragons of Winter Night, and Dragons of Spring Dawning, brings to life the ultimate battle between Good and Evil in the World of Krynn.  The books are so incredibly well written that the reader feels that they have been transported to another plane of existence and are actually present among the characters, seeing what they see, feeling what they feel, sensing what they sense.  The authors Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman have truly outdone themselves and have presented us with a masterpiece of literature the likes of which we have seen only in JRR Tolkien's work and RA Salvatore's The Dark Elf and Icewind Dale trilogies.  A GREAT trilogy indeed and a must read along with Margaret Weis' Legends trilogy!  Duty, honor, bravery, magic, dragons and heroes are all about.  One should seriously start thinking about maybe turning them into movies!

The books are so incredibly well written that the reader feels that they have been transported to another universe and are actually present among the characters, seeing what they see, feeling what they feel, sensing what they sense.

0679722610|4.0|Between 1915 and 1922, Dashiell Hammett worked for the Pinkerton Detective Agency, initially from Baltimore's Continental Building office and later in Washington State and California. His experiences for the firm provided the background and the name for the Continental Detective Agency that features in most of his stories and in two of his novels (including &quot;Red Harvest&quot;), and Pinkerton operative James Wright served as the model for the &quot;fat, middle-aged, hard-boiled, pig-headed guy&quot; referred to only as the Continental Op.<br />In &quot;Red Harvest,&quot; the Op is summoned to Personville (known locally as Poisonville), where he is engaged by newspaper publisher Donald Willson, who is murdered before the agent has an opportunity to meet him. At first the novel feels like a traditional murder mystery; in its first half there are two homicides (among more than two dozen gangland-style assassinations) whose clues are scattered for the reader--and the Op--to solve.<br />Yet the two whodunits are red herrings meant to distract--and entertain--the reader (and crime novel aficionados will figure both of them out within a few paragraphs). Not just a murder mystery, &quot;Red Harvest&quot; pursues broader themes: how corruption and greed poisons the inhabitants of Poisonville, how the Op is able to thwart the ambitions of various criminals by playing their own unprincipled game, and how his own abandonment of professional code nearly destroys the detective himself.<br />Most of the crooks are stock figures from noir central casting, but the novel's femme fatale, Dinah Brand, is the most memorable. She serves not only as foil to the Op's passionless cynicism but also as a warning to the dangers of the sport: like the Op, she insinuates herself into whichever camp is in control, never dirtying her own hands with the unsavory activities that bring her the money she voraciously accumulates--only to find herself expendable when no faction needs her at all.<br />During a flirtatious rendezvous with Dinah, the Op slips into a laudanum-induced dream, in which he imagines himself &quot;hunting for a man I hated.

B000066NW0|3.0|I have not listened to this cd nore will i ever. I already know what it is going to be and that i will only be able to listen to 1/3 of the cd with out gagging. I am here to b*tch about everyone thinks that Avril Lavigne (or good Charlote for that matter)is punk. Punk is actual music and is written by the band members. Not writing your music or sticking to a punk format( very few chords) is considered selling out which is what Avril did. She is there only for the money. NOT PUNK! This may be good pop its f*cking horrible punk.
B00003CX8J|1.0|I can't beleive this was at all based on the comic. Where do I even begin? This movie has taken all of the good elements out of the comic and replaced it with utter crap.<BR>  As far as the casting goes Wolverine probably got the best treatment. Jean and Cyclops were also good though they did not get the screen time they deserved. Who in the world came up with Halle Berry as Storm? She can't act her way out of a paper bag. Not to mention the bad accent. If she could not keep it all the way through she should not have done it. Anna Paquin was also a horrible idea. What happened to the southern accent that Rouge was famous for?<BR>  A lot of this can be blamed on the writing. Rouge has no history with Mystique and Wolverine has no history with Sabertooth. Even worse than that is the relationship with Rouge and Iceman. Iceman and Rouge were not even at the mansion at the same time. But all of these gripes aside this movie still sucked. I have to wonder if Chris Claremont had any say.

0316666343|3.0|What a disappointment this novel turned out to be.  It has a great start, nothing less than compulsive reading. It takes one to places with a fresh originality and a kind of innocence that the reader puts down to the writer's enormous creativity and technique.  But then suspicion sets in with those sentences that where not immediately clear and had to be reread for their esoteric content as they became suspiciously frequent. Could it be that this was not purposely ambiguous Zen type thinking but rather a reflection of an immature style of writing?<br />I initially also gave credit to the finally drawn characters but came to the conclusion as the book continued that they were so lightly colored as to be invisible. And then some half way through these characters that never come alive just take over in a messy not going anywhere believable way. The one character, Mr. Harvey, who holds interest and should have reaped his justifiable comeuppance from the author - well I read the book to the bitter end and for the life of me, just a few days later, I can't remember what happened to him at all.<br />Something went badly wrong with this book. Not only does the writer kill off her protagonist but she also murders her book with over-kill as she shamelessly milks her story for every last drop of emotion. To top it all, the writer asks the reader to suspend belief to the degree that we can accept that her murdered protagonist, who relates the tale, has decided to pop down to Earth from her heavenly abode for a quickie with a boy friend who once kissed her.<br />The first half of Ms. Alice Sebold's novel deserves a 5 star rating for originality and for its infectious innocence and the book is worth reading just for this; however, the second half can go safely be ignored. Where were all those people, editors etc. who should have been guiding the author?  Such a pity, as this story had enormous potential as an intelligent, moving and captivating read.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|If you liked 'bridget jones diary' and 'about a boy' you'll love this movie!
B00020HEG6|5.0|I saw the movie last night I also bought the soundtrack and I am listening to it right now and it is so good and Daniel Radciffe the kid that plays Harry he is sooooooooooooooo hot in movie. I love the movie a lot if you are a Harry Potter fan go and see this movie because it is so good I love it a lot. I have the another 2 of the movies and this one is the best. This movie is so scared and also funny too.
B000001DYD|5.0|There were a handful of great female artists to come out at once in the 90's, but none of them did what PJ Harvey did, which is to brutalize herself into her music, to reclaim every inch of self-punishment and anger pop music had sanded over.  Rid of Me pushes that thesis to its breaking point, seeing Harvey step into the role of man and woman, of Eve shrieking in hysterics at the snake in the garden of Eden, of Jane of the Jungle on her period.  It's a wild, unique creation, but at its center is the passion of an artist driven to fiery heights by her demons and then sublimating them into the darkest, angriest, most painful alternative masterpieces you've ever heard.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This is a must have for anyone who loves musical theatre!
B000060P79|1.0|simple plan just dress like there punk but release music that is crappy pop. its afwul
B00009RGBS|5.0|I thought this movie was great!  I think the actors were well suited to their roles.  The musical numbers are terrific and they get stuck in your mind for days.  All the actors showed their talents in areas beyond just acting.  Of course, all the women commit a &quot;sure I did it, but can you blame me&quot; type crime.  It's just a fun movie to watch.  Get it, you won't be disappointed.
B00008DDXC|5.0|I love the HP books soo much and when the movies came out for them I was really exicited! I can't wait to see the Prizoner of Azkaban! I hope J.k Rowling continues writing more books and I plead for more Harry Potter movies to come out because I'm in love with Daniel Radcliffe and the story.And if your wondering, yes I am overly obsessive lol!I don't see how any one could hate the story, unless you are really boring!
0790729628|3.0|No matter whether this is what Ridley Scott or Harrison Ford wanted, the original theatrical release is far better. The film noir detective style narration is what gives the film all its atmosphere. This film although still good, loses a lot of impact without it. I dont care either way on the ending sequence between this one and the original. I will be awaiting the special edition with both versions of the film, if they ever cut through the legal red tape and get it out.
0140177396|4.0|Of Mice and Men is an amazing tale of two men on a voyage to live big!  George is a man of low tolerance, and is traveling with the slow, but warm-hearted, Lenny.  I think the book was a well written story of how you can't take advantage of anyone, especially if they don't know that you are doing it.  Also, that you can't be too hard on a person who doesn't understand, because then they never will.  I think it was a good book because it provided many lessons that included those ones.  John Steinbeck introduced, and protrayed the characters in a manner that was very intriguing and realistic.  The way he showed Lenny to not be prejudice against Crooks because he didn't see the difference in them privded a good connection with how real people should act.  All around Of Mice and Men was a very good book and I would recommend it because it can change the way you think about certain people.
0743454529|5.0|I am recommending this book to everyone that I know.  This is one of those rare books that I will keep to read over and over again.
0765310015|5.0|I have read this novel no less than 3 times over the last few years.  Originally released in UK and at first deemed far to complicated for American audiences, Gardens of the Moon finally sees the light of day in the states.<br />Summing up the plot would be like trying to sum up the civil war in a paragraph so I will leave that up to other word smiths that are far craftier than I.  Suffice to say that this is only the beginning of something much larger.  As book 5 has been released in the UK it may come as a relief to some that they can order the further books in the series.<br />The second novel is a heart retching story of a group of refugees on the run.  Book 3 finds the Bridge Burners outlawed and on the run.  Book 4 brings all of the plots together while opening even more.  Book five is a departure as it takes place on another continent.<br />I suspect that some Jordan fans may have trouble with this book.  However, like Robert Jordan, many plots and sub plots run through out the novels to make up a larger overarching story.  Unlike Jordan things actually conclude in Eriksons books.  He ties up threads and plots and is not afraid to kill of main characters much like G R R Martin.  I remember an interview he did once where he said something to the effect of &quot;why do these dark lords want to rule the world?  What are they going to do with the land once it is scorched and dead?&quot;<br />My best recommendation is that once you finish this book and pick your jaw up off of the floor read it again while waiting for the second one to arrive from Amazon's UK site.<br />In 20+ years of reading fantasy I can remember few books I enjoyed as much as this one.  Sorry to gush but this is such a great story it should be required reading by some of our more popular writers.
B000002LGA|4.0|This is reed's most socially consious album to date,also the album is not overy-produced,and the arrangement's are not layered with alot of instrumentation and effects.Although his spoken word delivery is at a faster pace for those who are not overly familiar with Lou Reed,It may take repeated listening to catch ever phrase of every song on the album.It has a strong driving rock and roll feel to it  on the faster numbers,However on the slower softer tracks,the band sounds more melodic.Some reviewers have not been so complimentary to Reed's lyrics,suggesting that he come's off sounding preachy and self-righteous,Instead he comes off giving an intimate portrait of the darker side of life.Reed could just as easily spoken of the affluence of new york city,given that he's not exactly a poor musician,But Reed has a strong sense of community,and a concern for all the downtrodden in society.He paints a mental picture in your mind of new york city,as well as urban conditions in most any large city.Reed has assembled a trio of musicians along with him including Mike Ratke on lead guitar,Rob Wasserman on upright bass and Fred Maher on drums,Which adds a backdrop to Reed's visual lyric's,However ,there are a couple of tracks on the album where Reed's lyrics seem to run off the page,Because the songs appear to be overwritten,and not simplified enough.Example:On &quot;Dime store mystery&quot;,The duality of nature\Godly nature\human nature\ splits the soul\Fully human\fully divine and divided.The great immortal soul split into pieces\whirling pieces.&quot;The begining of a great adventure&quot;<BR>Some wizened toothless clod,some gibbering old fool,Some senile old fart suggest too many examples to describe himself as well as other events and situations.This is the only problem i have with the album ,Otherwise ,this is an excellent listen for any rock enthusiast.<br />In addition<br />This is a great disk,But if you can find a live video cassette of the album,I would recommend italong with the album.In my opinion,the live version is more free flowing and relaxed than the CD.<br />Sonics: Grungy and Dense<br />Performance: Excellent and Strong.
6305537321|5.0|Film starts with Audrey Hepburn stopping by Tiffany & Co. in the morning at 6am, having her breakfast pretzel and coffee while standing in front of the Tiffany store, looking through the window and staring at the beatiful Tiffany's jewellery. She feels calm, relax, joyfully walking back to her apartment. Story begins with her new neighbor....      This is a truly gorgeous romantic film, a real classic. A film really you can watch many many times without getting bored. Since 1961, I'm sure lots of people agree and have been watching this film again and again and again during this 40 years. Oscar winning music, beautiful theme song 'Moon River' meets with gorgeous romantic story.       &quot;Moon river wider than a mile   I'm crossing you in style someday   You dream maker, you heartbreaker   Wherever you're going I'm going your way   Two drifters off to see the world   There's such a lot of world to see   We're after the same rainbows end   Waiting round the band   My huckleberry friend, moon river   And me...&quot;      Such charming may wonder you ever find a counterpart from nowadays. Overall, buy it own it watch it feel it and re-watch it.      *** Otto Yuen's DVD Special Rating for Breakfast at Tiffany's ***   1. Film Rewatchability: LIFETIME   2. DVD Featurability: WEAK   3. Picture Quality: VERY GOOD   4. Sound Quality: VERY GOOD      (Reviewed by Otto Yuen, 5-Jun-2004)

0786915749|5.0|I'm usually wary about female writers who write fantasy. I always though dragonlance would involve too much romance and very little action. Boy, was I wrong! This series has me hooked. The wonderful thing is, especially, if you are a roleplayer, you get to follow a group of people through their adventures just like in roleplaying games. <BR>This book though a part of a trilogy, can be considered a complete story. Nowadays many writers prefer to  leave you hanging in the end of their books, wanting you wait for the next one, which is always frustrating. But not this one. If you don't want to get into dragonlance, which I doubt will happen after reading this one, you can stop right after this book and call it a good story.<BR>The world of Krynn is in peril. The evil dragons under the control fo the god, the Dark Queen, have begun their invasion. But the good gods of old have not forgotten their people even if they have been pushed aside. This is where we begin to follow 6 adventurers - an elf ranger, a mage, a thief, a knight, a cleric, and barbarian- unwillingly pulled into this conflict but believe in honor and sacrifice and love.<BR>Get this book. You will enjoy it.
B00006RINF|5.0|Where to begin?  How about the thundering vocals of Christina Scabbia?  Or the underrated male voice of Andrea Ferraro?  Perhaps the amazing guitar melodies and lightning fast yet melodic drumwork?  I don't know.<br />This is my first review, so I have chosen to review my favourite album ever, and that award goes to Comalies.<br />Comalies is one of those albums you don't just hear, you feel it.  I listen to any given song on Comalies and it takes an incredible amount of willpower to press pause or stop.<br />From the very beggining of the murky intro of Swamped, right up to the high pitched howl that concludes the song Comalies, this album is grade A quality material.  The female singing is brilliant, and the male singing is quite underrated and also amazing.<br />Comalies is a reccomended buy to those who want to seriously get into music as it should be, rather than the background noise the radio provides day by day.  This album is not something to play in the background, its something you can sit down and listen to.
0446530573|5.0|You will be suprised at the quality of the recipes in the book. However, some of them are not quite on the mark: lemon chicken is a wonderful recipe calling for oregano, garlic, olive oil, and slices of lemon and potatoes baked with chicken, but the bake time and temperature turn out under-cooked stringy chicken even in a new oven. Some of the recipes, like in Dr. Melfi's section use convenience foods which I don't like. But the recipes can be played around with and are a sound basis for delicious meals. They're quality, you just need to adjust some things. But I gave the book 5 stars because there are wonderful &quot;quotes&quot; from Sopranos characters. Furio tells us in an interview that Americans use too much sauce on their pasta, &quot;it's like soup.&quot; Also un-Italian is the custom of having cappuccino after a meal, &quot;like a milkshake.&quot; Then there's Pauli's &quot;How to Cut a Garlic.&quot; Pauli tells the reader the difference between slicing, chopping, and mashing garlic, all important distinctions as they change the flavor of the dish. And never use a garlic press, that's &quot;mayonnaise.&quot; As an Italian who knew these customs but also happens to like mayonnaise, I think most people will enjoy this book. It functions wonderfully as a gift.
B00000JCOV|5.0|This is a very good album, full of some of the hardest music out there and a unique sound that can't be duplicated by anyone.  Some people say its worthless having 9 people in the band, but if any of them went missing we'd notice.  Slipknot have an original sound, while applying the typical heaviness everybody likes to it.<br />This CD is a true hardcore CD that never stops pounding you with some hard assed music, unlike most bands that have at least one ballad or a soft moment in at least one of their songs, slipknot stays heavy throughout the entire album (excluding scissors).<br />This CD is great for when your in a hyped up mood and you want some kick ass music to listen to, it's a nonstop adrenaline rush that no other band can provide.
B0001NBMBC|3.0|Okay, I've just read the lyrics to this online and even though all I've heard from the disc is Duality, I'm going to give it a three. And I'm being nice here. (...) People always trash nu-metal, but when bands \\"evolve\\" they completely screw up. Marilyn Manson's Golden Age of Grotesque wasn't that good, either. I won't even touch that new Limp Bizkit disc with a 30 foot pole. Also, everyone's been saying that there's a Stone Sour influence on Subliminal Verses. Yeah? Then where's the \\"Get Inside\\" stuff about mopping up all the blood and guts and sh*t? Cannibal Corpse is still good, but they're a joke. Always have been. How serious can you take a band that has a picture of a rotting vagina on one of their album covers? Rap looked for a while like it was going to get good, but then Eminem stopped talking about raping his mother and killing women. Nu-metal was an ape that has now evolved. Except the ape evolved near a nuclear waste facility and has become a Jerry's Kids excuse for a human. If you want a good band, get some System of a Down. Their first disc was good, the second better, and \\"Steal This Album\\" actually deserves to be bought as opposed to downloaded. Not true for other bands. . .
B00005A46T|3.0|I liked the original slipknot CD because it was nonstop heaviness, not a single soft moment on the whole CD except for the very beggining and the very end, it was like one big heavy song.  Slipknot provided something no other band could provide, and managed to stay heavy as hell the entire CD.<br />All of slipknots appeal changed with iowa for me, this CD lets down sometimes and stops pummeling you with hard music, therefore slipknot loses their appeal in my mind.  The hard songs are still good songs, and My Plague is probably my favourite slipknot song of all, however because of songs like Gently and Skin Ticket, with their despicable soft moments and mellow vibes, this CD cannot equal their original.<br />Compared to average music its an awesome CD, and some of the songs on here are actually better than the original CD, but slipknots appeal is spoiled by the presence of &quot;merciful moments.&quot;
0380789019|5.0|I have loved this book for so long now. I would almost beg for a sequel. The characters perhaps the best developed of any Gaiman  has done keep this story fresh even years after the publication. I recommend the story highly. A true orginal.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|In The Zone is surely Jive recording artist Britney Spears's best album so far.  Its addictive club-oriented pop beats make you a foot-tapper without even realizing it.  Though Brit's vocal chops haven't gotten any better, her writing skills have definitely improved with age - Spears has composed 7 songs on this record.  Best songs are the No. 1 hit \\"Toxic\\" (the first of Britney's since \\"Oops!...I Did It Again\\"), the bittersweet \\"Shadow\\", the heartaching \\"Everytime\\" and the (...) \\"Touch of My Hand.\\"  Even if you don't like Britney you'll love this CD.  It's THAT good.
0316666343|5.0|This book is so compelling and interesting.... if you let yourself believe that Susie is indeed telling her story from Heaven, you can take part in an amazing story of love, life and family. I loved this book!

078322799X|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater years ago and I have always loved it!  It is quite a thriller....fasten your seatbelt!  I was laughing, crying, and screaming all at the same time.  A must for any collection
B0001HAISG|5.0|I rented this eagerly since I missed it in the theaters. What I expected wasn't exactly what I got. This turned out to be a wonderful adaption from the book. The special effects made Neverland look like it should, unlike others like &quot;Hook&quot; and Disney's cartoon.<br />What surprised me the most was the psychological level to this movie. Yes, children will fall in love with it. But there is another element to be enjoyed by older viewers. I would expect some overprotective parents to be offended by this movie. But quite honestly it's as innocent as it could be, since children really won't understand the double play on Hook and Wendy's father, nor the relationship between Wendy and Peter in it's entirety.<br />If you're looking for something interesting that will entertain both you and children alike, this is your movie.
006019250X|5.0|I've read many books in my lifetime, but none have had the same effect on my life as this one.  Disguised as a beautiful story, lies many truths that make you think and examine your own life.  It gives you a different viewpoint on life, it opens your eyes to so many things you never really stopped to think about before. I felt so refreshed after reading this book.  I would recommend all of Paulo Coelho's books to everyone.  I've read the Alchemist, Veronika Decides to Die, and By the River Piedra I Sat Down and Wept. They each had thier own affect, depending on your own personal situation.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Avril is the most outstanding canadian punk rocker. Both of her albums are great, but i think this one hit the top chart. &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; is a wonderful song in this album, and the rest are just as great. I would seriously give Avril five thumbs up if had that many thumbs.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This beautiful masterpiece of understatement, and hope has left an immense impression on me. Vividly honest and fresh with a genuine sentimentality, Sofia Coppola weaves the lives of Murray and Johannsen together in an unforgettable and compelling tale of loneliness, love, and commitment. Two star-crossed lovers, islanded by their strength of character that keeps them apart, nevertheless find a happiness with each other that validates and gives meaning to their world-weary lives.<BR>If you anticipate certain roles to be fulfilled and plot devices to be executed in the movies you watch, do not buy this DVD. It is a crisp and soothing breath of fresh air that effortlessly smashes the boundaries of Hollywood romantic comedies, not to be appreciated by those with overarching optimistic sentimentalities and expectations of their movie-going experiences
B0001NBMBC|3.0|Congrats to Rick Rubin for making Slipknot appeal to 80% of those who currently watch MTV. Slipknot now joins the ranks of Metallica, Eminem, Jessica Simpson, Nelly, Snoop Dogg, etc... Welcome to pre-packaged money making MTV fake generation. Slipknot now sounds like pretty much every other pop rock group out there. Some say they just grew up, yep grew up and developed a taste for bling.
B00004T9UF|1.0|I can't believe I used to like his music.... how embarrassing! If you are a fan of rap music in general (poor you) then I suggest you should listen to Dr Dre or something but NOT eminem. His lyrics are pathetic, the songs are all the same with the same repetitive beat and he just skits everyone when he's not exactly perfect himself! This is the music I cannot stand when all the scallies go around in their cars with it on full volume. On the other hand, if you want to listen to talented music and hate rap in general (like me) then go out and buy an Opeth record or punk like NOFX. This is just commercialised rubbish.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|With today's trends leaning more and more towards \\"lesbian chic\\" and such, girl on girl action has become just another ordinary, yet still discouraged, occurance; however, two of the forerunners of this trend, Lena and Yulia of t.A.T.u., have found a distinguished way to separate themselves from the typical \\"I make out with girls for attention\\" fad-followers:  their phenomenal voices, their foreign sex appeal, and some VERY good lyrics.<BR>     <BR>Overall, this CD has a nice variety of songs on it... from the upbeat and fast paced \\"Show Me Love\\" to the angelic and torn \\"Stars\\", t.A.T.u. has had my stereo working overtime for a week or so now. They even delve into the world of covers, chosing the song \\"How Soon is Now\\" originally by the Smiths. This song works well with the angst which is so openly and obviously expressed in many of their songs.<br />I don't thing I would rate any song on their album less than a 4 out of 5... actually, that might be \\"low-balling\\" them a little, even. Some songs are overtly sexual and in your face, such as the mainstream hit \\"All the Things She Said\\" and some sneak up on you like \\"Clowns\\", a fast paced song about ignorant people trying to shield themselves from things that they do not understand or agree with: \\"Don't you hide your eyes from me, Open them and see me now.\\"<BR>     <BR>After playing \\"Ya Soshla S Uma\\" and \\"Nas Ne Dagoniat\\" a few times, I am overcome by a strong desire to learn Russian and an even stronger desire to learn more about t.A.T.u.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Let Go was one of the best CDs I've ever heard.  This CD makes Let Go look pathetic.  If that doesn't tell you how awesome it is then I guess you don't know music from a monotonal pip-squeak.<br />&quot;Take Me Away&quot; is one of the best songs on this CD, and I believe it's also one of the best Avril has ever written &amp; sang.  &quot;Together&quot; and &quot;My Happy Ending&quot; are other great notables.  People that think &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; is a great song should definitely get this CD because it's no where near the best song on the CD, although it is a great song.<br />This CD officially places Avril firmly back in my top 5 Bands (which isn't easy to get in to) with bands like The Corrs, Linkin Park, StainD and the Dixie Chicks.
078401213X|1.0|I wanted to spend some time with my son,and he suggested Pi,which had been sitting on the shelf for a few months,as it was part of a two-pack with Requiem for a Dream{a very good film}.Big Mistake!Grainy black and white with annoying soundtrack,the high point being an orbital tune{the girl with the sun in her head,i believe}.The most offensive sounds were when Max,the protagonist,was having his many migraines,which increase in intensity.The plot concerns Max's search for meaning through numbers.He becomes obsessed and his life becomes a downward spiral of pain and paranoia to the final,drill-induced resolution.If this sounds like your cup of misery,enjoy,and don't forget the advil.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I was lucky enough to view this Dvd with a friend of mine from England. We were both mesmerized by how great the performers were. My personal favourite was Billy Prestons version of My Sweet Lord. His rendition was both soulful and spiritual and it could have gone on for another 20 minutes as far as I am concerned. Clapton gets top marks for organizing a well balanced show. The audio and picture quality is bar none and this Dvd is<BR>an absolute must for any that appreciates great music of this gender.
B00005V331|5.0|This is where black metal began, even though the term didn't come into use until Venom's second album, &quot;Black Metal&quot; came out. Still, this is where it all started. There's not much to say about this that hasn't been said already, so I'll just say that this is essential if you like REAL HEAVY METAL! Sure, &quot;Black Metal&quot; was more raw &amp; really scary, but this one has the attitude. Sure, Venom's musical skills were limited in the beginning, but after all, it's the feeling of the music that mattered. And this was one rowdy, blasphemous piece of vinyl (or CD, in 2004). After hearing the opening track, &quot;Sons of Satan&quot;, you kind of knew what you were getting yourself into. Nearly every song on here is classic Venom, like, oh let's see, &quot;Welcome to Hell&quot;; the early thrash masterpiece &quot;Witching Hour&quot;, with its churchbell-like bass intro, complete with thunderstorm &amp; various scary sounds; &quot;In League with Satan&quot;, with backwards Satanic intro and tribal drum beats. It even has a cool little guitar interlude called &quot;Mayhem with Mercy&quot;, which, amazingly, isn't Satanic at all, but still sounds good. Another cool thing on here is the band quote which said, 'If this lp is warped or defaced in any way, please throw it away and buy a new one'. How many bands would say that? Most black metal bands all seem to sound the same. Screaming obscenities, playing 1000 m.p.h. on every song, never doing anything different, but Venom did things differently. Almost all their songs sounded unique, with interesting lyrics. You could actually remember the way the songs went after you heard them. Anyway, that's my opinion. Buy this CD and if you don't like it, T.S.!
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Avril Lavigne shows no signs of slowing down whatsoever, as her first album was a massive hit, and her second id bound to be even bigger. On &quot;Under My Skin&quot;, Lavigne shows growth, meaning and depth, and her tunes are 100% irresistable. Lavigne should have no worries avoiding the sophomore scare, as this record is absolutely incredible.<br />Key Tracks: &quot;Forgotten&quot;, &quot;Fall to Pieces&quot;, &quot;My Happy Ending&quot;, &quot;Together&quot;.
B0001M0A4I|5.0|Tony Banks is best known as the keyboardist and founding member of the legendary rock band Genesis. With the Genesis members now pursing their own projects full-time, Banks has ventured into a musical genre that he had been longing to tackle for quite sometime but never got around to until recently - orchestral music. The release of \\"Seven\\" offers the first fruits of Tony Banks compositional style for orchestra and is quite an extraordinary effort from beginning to finish.<br />The work is divided into seven movements (hence the title \\"Seven\\") and runs close to an hour in length. Besides Banks' own musical voice (which is evident throughout the entire work), there are hints of the great Classical composers which have preceeded him heard as well. Elements of Tchaikovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, Berlioz and latter-day Beethoven are all apparent alongside Banks' brilliant compositional style. There are also influences of the great film composers John Williams and Jerry Goldsmith heard throughout this music (Tony Banks himself has also scored the occasional film).<br />Without a doubt, Tony Banks has released a fine orchestral debut. His talents as a composer are shown at their fullest and greatest. While this is his first symphonic offering, I hope it won't be the last.<br />Highly recommended for fans of Romantic-era classical music and orchestral film scores!!
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Avril Lavigne's latest set, &quot;Under My Skin&quot; proves to be an amazing effort from the Canadian teen. Her songs show growth, meaning and depth, and the songs are absolutely irresistable. Truly, there is no need for the sophomore scare in Lavigne's case, as she has proven that clearly, the second time's the charm.<br />Key Tracks: &quot;Forgotten&quot;, &quot;Fall to Pieces&quot;, &quot;My Happy Ending&quot;, &quot;Together&quot;.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I thought this cd was very good. My favorite song is &quot;He Wasn't&quot;! I think every Avril Fan should own this cd!
B00009RDG8|3.0|And that is nothing like sarcasm. Okay, it is. It's a lot like sarcasm, actually. Maybe if it weren't Tommy Lee Jones as the star it wouldn't be so obvious to any viewer, but to me what it came down to was a tough, know-it-all smart guy chasing a resourceful criminal that apparently no one else can catch.     The Hunted seemed to have promise in the previews. Jones of course is usually good in everything (others might say this is because he typically plays the same character). And since starring in The Usual Suspects, Benicio Del Toro can really do no wrong. But The Hunted is a strange film, awkwardly left of center, as though it was aware of it's own triteness so it tries to overcompensate for it in random areas - violence, gore, and casting for example. Watching the movie I couldn't help but feel it was far beneath Del Toro's ability. He is certainly more gifted than to play the run-of-the-mill action star that he is in The Hunted.     The Hunted is a typical disciple-gone-wrong movie. Del Toro, a deeply covert special forces soldier who \\"doesn't really exist\\" is so battle scarred that he goes AWOL and kills some innocent people. Once the government realizes this, they send the man who trained him - Jones - to track him down and catch him. From here it unfolds in an extraordinarily predictable way. The audience is left to feel as though they are watching out of obligation rather than actual interest - 9/10 viewers could probably outline the rest of the story. To try to hold our interest then, the filmmakers include a deep amount of gore in the movie, much more than a typical action film would have. Whether it's photos of decapitations or showing us orphaned children stepping though bodies in Somalia trying to find their parents, The Hunted delivers some disturbing scenes     The problem is that the film doesn't really earn the right to do this. What I mean is, if I'm going to look at sickening images then it really needs to be a good movie otherwise. I'm not goingto look at it for the sake of looking at it, and unfortunately that's all The Hunted has to offer.     I advise avoiding this film despite the promising cast. You'll just be waiting for plot twists that never come and hoping Benicio gets back on track in his next role choice.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I liked Firefly a lot when it first aired, and watching the show again plus the 3 unaired episodes makes it all the sadder that this show was cancelled. I think any fan of Buffy, Star Trek, Farscape, or Babylon 5 who gave this show a a chance would have been quickly hooked. This is one of the best sci-fi series ever. If you didn't see it when it aired, buy this DVD because you're in for a treat.
B000069CWE|5.0|Linkin Park's &quot;Reanimation&quot; is a remarkable CD. Many people I know said they wouldn't buy it because they assumed it was just a collection of extended, watered-down versions of their originals. Untrue. Each song is completely unique from it's parent, often times barely resembling it. With each song they took it to the next level, sometimes rerecording/rewriting the entire vocal or rap section to make it different from the original. &quot;Pushing Me Away&quot; comes to mind as a great example of this. So there's the first thing - this is not just a pale reflection of &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;; it's completely fresh takes on the songs, including some previously unreleased cuts only available to LP fan club members.<br />Although they used a dozen different producers throughout the CD it has an amazing continuity to it. The same melodic string and piano motifs appear throughout each recording, connecting it in a surreal way. There is only one production that seems out of place to me, and it's on the worst possible song - &quot;In The End.&quot; This was their biggest hit from &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; and fans were expecting more out of it than any other cut on the record (at least I was). They destroyed it. The producers gave the song a shuffle feel and laced it with the &quot;yo-yo-yo&quot; street thing, rather than the more rapcore attitudes that permeate the rest of &quot;Reanimation.&quot; Terrible.<br />Fortunately, though, the rest of the CD shines. This may be the first record, with the exception of &quot;Hybrid Theory,&quot; that utilizes the newest technology for the good of music, not for the worse of it. Here's a brief explanation. <br />Music is done entirely on computers today. There is no more tape. Only hard drives. We can now work with music in a similar way that a writer works with a word processor - just cut and paste. The result has been the demise of music. We now have tools of unbelievable power, undreamt of only ten years ago, yet the quality of music has steadily gotten worse. Why? Because the tools are so powerful and simplified that unqualified musicians can now use them. Performances can always be &quot;fixed later&quot; so a good performance doesn't really matter anymore. The vocals can be tuned, the drums can be put in time - not need to waste precious studio time on perfectionism. That's if you're lucky enough to be in a studio. Most of these systems are in the producer's house, which brings us to the second reason for demise - location. We no longer need 84 channel consoles and racks upon racks of outboard gear. It's all in the computer. Anyway, I'm going off a little too much. The point is, music quality is declining because enormous power is now in the hands of people who aren't qualified to have it.<br />Linkin Park, however, has used this power for good. They've managed to use it to produce new sounds we've never heard before and to overall improve the quality of their sounds. On &quot;Reanimation&quot; the editing is used as an instrument as much as anything else.<br />Make sure to stick with every song because they often turn midway through into some new, amazing section. Track 7 comes to mind as a production with a less interesting first half that ends up providing the best moment on the album in the outro. If you liked &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; I can't imagine you wouldn't love &quot;Reanimation.&quot;
B000089CJI|4.0|It's a bit hard to categorize The Postal Service. I think the reviewer &quot;nycgirl&quot; has probably done the best job summing them up. Their style is a wonderful eclectic blend of electronic sounds with various influences. Many of the tracks on this album really go out on an experimental limb, yet they still manage to be consistently successful in their efforts, coming up with tunes that are more and more catchy each time you listen. And each track also manages to be distinctly unique, while still retaining a common thread throughout the album.<br />The song that first attracted me to The Postal Service was &quot;Such Great Heights,&quot; which I heard on my local radio station and immediately loved. By the time the station got around to playing &quot;The District Sleeps Alone Tonight,&quot; &quot;Sleeping In,&quot; and &quot;We Will Become Silhouettes,&quot; I knew I had to get the album. I haven't been disappointed. It would be nearly impossible for me to pick a favorite track, but if forced to choose I'd probably say track 4 - &quot;Nothing Better.&quot; The song plays out as a dialogue between a romantic dreamer of a guy, trying to persuade his sweetheart not to leave, and the girl that's doing the leaving. The balance of male and female vocals is beautiful, and the musical beat beneath is irresistible.<br />The messages of the song lyrics are also enlightened and soothing. You won't find any anger or bitterness here. Perhaps a tinge of wistfulness sprinkled throughout, but the overall feeling of the album is very hopeful.<br />As much as I'd like to give this album five stars, however, I do have two small criticisms. While I can find no fault with tracks 1-9, the 10th and final track seems (to me) to leave a little to be desired. It's mostly instrumental, with only a small series of lyrics toward the end of the song (which is fine - that isn't the problem), and doesn't seem to have quite the same feel as the rest of the album. Where the other tracks are upbeat and lively, this last one has a bit of a spooky, unsettling sound to it, and I don't think it's the best way to close the album. I usually just stop the CD after the 9th track.<br />My other disappointment is that the album is just too short. It's over far too quickly, and I would have loved to have a few more songs included.<br />However, my bottom-line judgement is that this is an excellent album. It's the perfect thing if you want to lie back and relax (I often play it as I'm drifting off to sleep). You just can't help but feel good while listening. The full lyrics are included in the cover insert, which is always nice, though the vocals are perfectly intelligible without needing to read along. If you've heard and liked even just one song by The Postal Service, I can almost guarantee that you'll be happy with this album. Highly recommended!eat and lively, this last one has a bit of a spooky, unsettling sound to it, and I don't think it's the best way to close the album.

B000005ILF|5.0|Mercury Falling may be Sting's best work to date and is by far his most underrated album.  Why Mercury Falling has been so neglected baffles me.  It is his most mature and immediate work.  It is, I think, his most personal album.  It is morose and it is beautiful.<BR>  Some would say that taste is relative.  Some would also prefer pizza to caviar or Marbuzet to Margaux, but for the refined ear there is Mercury Falling.
B000003TA4|2.0|Nevermind and all music labled as grunge is awful because the label somehow permits your band to sound like cr@p and get away with it. Here are some of the many ways &quot;Grunge&quot; bands like Nirvana got away with halfa$$ing their music: <BR>a.) They claim their playing is sh*tty because they have too much &quot;passion&quot; to actually show some talent <BR>b.) They claim that their playing without tune or talent is to &quot;lash out against all the ills of society&quot; <BR>c.) They give you the ever-popular, ever-such-a lie that they're making &quot;art&quot;. <br />I think that other people here are curious what else is out there besides Nirvana because they are sick of Nirvana and/or adknowledge Nirvana blew and that all new bands formed after 1998 suck. Here's a wide range of bands I like that are everything Nirvana thought they were too &quot;Punk&quot; to be like (from New Wave to Blues to Alt Rock to Mutant Space Metal to Rap to Funk to Jazz to instrumental compositions)...<br />Depeche Mode, Oingo Boingo, Melissa Etheridge, Public Image Ltd., Miles Davis, Smashing Pumpkins, Love Battery, GWAR, Jimi Hendrix, Heart, David Bowie, Cypress Hill, Coolio, The Go-Go's, The Red Hot Chili Peppers, The B-52's, The Fixx, New Order, Joy Division, Blondie, Garbage, The Police, Genesis, Phil Collins, Bow Wow Wow, The Clash, The Presidents of the United States of America, and Soundtracks like Edward Scissorhands and Batman Returns (composed by Danny Elfman)
6305232660|4.0|Many people tend to compare this movie to armageddon, as they are both about the idea of a celestial body (in this case a comet, in the case of armageddon an asteroid) on a collision course with the earth, and seeing as how they were released in very close proximatey to one another. I think this has a lot to do with some people's lack of love for Deep impact, but the reality is these were two very different movies.<br />While &quot;Armageddon&quot; was a great movie in it's own rate, it was more of an action-romance movie that was meant to apeal to a braoder audience and satisfy movie-goers' typical demands of a major release. But with Deep Impact a much different aproach was taken, following in the way of the traditional Disaster Movie Genre. <br />From the beginning we are introduced to one of the main Characters, an upstart reporter investigating your run of the mill political love affair scandal, but stumbles instead upon the biggest story of history, that there is a monstrous comet on a collision course with earth. And so unfold's the American government's plan to send an team of asteronauts to intercept the comet and plant enough nukes on it to deflect it off course. The movie handles the plot from a much more epic, and at the same time much more personal level than armageddon.<br />The romance angle of the story is provided by the young boy who unwittingly discovered the comet and his girl neighbor. As counter measures fail, and plan B, C and D are called into action the terrible reality that only so many can be saved, and that it has to be decided who lives and dies sets in. A national lottery determines who will get passage to a special fallout shelter-like cave complex that was built in secret to house 1 million people. The rest are left to fend for themselves. <br />I really found deep impact to be more emotional, though not as romantic as armageddon. Characters will die, babies will be deperated from parents, young people will be asked to carry burdens that they shouldnt have to deal with and cities are destroyed as part of the asteroid hits the atlantic and causes a massive tsunami. Watching all this really had a more realistic and more message-orientated feel to it than Armageddon. I liked that the movie seemed to follow closer to the science and horrow of what a comet impact could cause, and how that affected the characters and our society. This made the movie much more interesting to me in many ways, and much realer as well. <br />The special effects are well done enough for the time period, and actually the tidal-wave scene where you watch a city massive wall of water inundate the city, hills and forests was quite ae inspiring. This is well done and will make your jaw drop when you see it. <br />The only problems are some inconsistant acting, and the fact that this movie is a bit slow and might not appeal to some viewers as much as armageddon because it's not an action movie.<br />All in all this was a great disaster movie and I thought it did a better job than armageddon in many ways of dealing with the actual plot scenario, though I like that movie as well just for different reasons. But if you're looking for a good sci-fi based disaster movie that will touches on many deeper levels than similar movies than this is your best bet. You're better off renting Deep Impact than you are going to the theater to see &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot;.

B00000G3PA|4.0|While Deep Impact gave me more of an experience, and it more the type of movie I'd watch at home, Armageddon is more the type of movie the mainstream movie-going public wanted back in the 98. Armageddon serves as effective action movie, a very effect romance movie, and all-around great pop-corn flick.<br />Armageddon is based on the Idea of an asteroid on a collision course with earth and a team odf deep sea oil drillers (lead by bruce willis) that is sent along with a team of traditional astronauts to land on the asteroid and plant nukes to destroy it. if this sounds familiar it's because it was done very similarly though with a different attitude in &quot;Deep Impact&quot; which was released around the same time. While &quot;Deep Impact&quot; was a Disaster movie in every way, focusing on the effects of this natural disaster on society, individuals lives and the world in general... Armageddon is told from a more... &quot;hollywood&quot; viewfinder.<br />Instead of taking on the persona of a disaster flick, Armageddon does a nice job of transitioning a sci-fi/disaster movie plot as a medium via which to deliver an action romance movie. The romance in Armageddon is done well, with Bruce Willis's daughter and one of his crew being involved in a passionate love affair that is going on underneath daddy's nose. The 'disaproving father' dynamic isn't the most original but makes an interesting emotional angle, especially at the end. The effects in armageddon are good, but the movie is more centered around the action-based and love-inspired events of our characters rather than the ramifications this disasterous event would have on our planet. You'll see some nice CGI impacts, but most of the effects are space based here.<br />The real way in which armageddon becomes a good movie is the way the action, romance and intermittent humor is in a very nice balance throughout. You'll laugh... you'll cry (or want to cry)... and you'll be on the edge of your seat more than once. This is what the mainstream asks of a movie, and in the end is the main reason Armageddon is remembered as being better than deep impact by most people I know. Indeed Armageddon does feel like a better, more consisten cinematic endevour than it's rival, though it lacks many dimensions to it that &quot;Deep Impact&quot; picked up perfectly.<br />All things considered most people will be pleased with Armageddon, whether you're looking for a fun, action movie to pass the time, or a heart throbbing romance. The end of the movie will leave you feeling satisfied, and entertained, where as the end of Deep Immpact will leave you feeling sad and disconcerted as you ponder the sobering realities of the basis of the plot. I saw this movie in the theater and everyone enjoyed it.
B000002H2H|2.0|Everyone say that Ride The Lightning is Metallica's flawless album and that it was their best.  Well, I think that Ride The Lightning is totally over rated, because it has the worst songs that Metallica ever made put into one CD.  The only good song that is on this album is Fight Fire With Fire and Ride the Lightning.  Everything else is terrible to the max.
B00006RCSU|1.0|This needs 0 stars.  This movie was so poorly made. they try to put shakespearian dialog in with a movie that takes place in the 90's with a bunch of seemingly stoned spazes and popcorn farts that don't know what they're doing.  I won't read the play again because of this movie.  Nothing in the movie was right.  And if you know who did the music, give them a kick in the b*l*s for me.
B000002H6C|5.0|I think that this album should deserve a 6/5 starts, but they dont have 6 stars... Well this album is Metallica's greatest including their debut album Kill Em All.  I think everyone should get this album even if you arent a crazed Metallica fan.  This album is awesome, every song is good none of the songs are disappointing.  The best song on this album is One i just love that song because it is about some person and a war.  Stop reading this review and go out and get it.
0618526412|5.0|I was a freshman in college when I first discovered this book -- a paperback with a beautiful cover -- and was at once caught up in its marvelously realized world of all too human characters.  Like McCullers' other masterpiece, The Member of the Wedding, this is a heartbreaking book, reflecting great sadness in its tender portrait of the ordinary people of an ordinary town, and the sweet, generous aspirations of a lone girl who wants so badly to embrace life and to make a difference.  McCullers left us only a few books, but what an influence she had on my life and so many many others. She was the image of young genius, yet so incredibly wise. Her short story &#34;A Tree, A Rock, A Cloud,&#34; is unforgettable.  Hers is an authentic Southern Gothic voice, yet always beautifully restrained, and unfailingly compassionate.
B000002H33|1.0|I can't believe why everyone think that this album is their best or is flawless.  It totally sucks and the only good thing about it is the song Battery.  All the rest of the songs suck especially Damage Inc.  I say that you shouldnt get this. Just save up that money and buy some other band's music.  I think that instead of buying this, you should get Slipknot's Subliminal Verses Vol. 3 it makes this album digraceful.
1592400876|5.0|Were I still in my beloved English classroom, prepping my kids for elegant expository essays, ACT/SAT's, and life beyond, this clever little rant would have been excerpted and added to a curricular favorite I'd put together to make a punctuation point:  Less is often more, but right is always right. To that end, I had devised a number of sentences and a paragraphs which, as Ms. Truss demonstrates, could mean radically different things depending on a comma here, a semi-colon there, and an occasional errant or missing apostrophe.  <br />Ms. Truss is to be commended for bringing the importance of exactitude in this seemingly &quot;easy&quot; task of knowing and using even minimal punctuation correctly.   In this regard, her fun and erudite little book feels much like John Rigden's elegant treatise of a few years back, &quot;Hydrogen: The Essential Element&quot; in which he demonstrates the depth and breadth of knowledge this simplest of elements has bequeathed to us. <br />Yet even physicist Rigden requires Ms. Truss's prosaic usages as the alpha point in his revelatory hymn to and of hydrogen!  Thank you, Ms. Truss, for lighting this cautionary flare against sloppiness in the cyber-era when the printed text matters even more than it ever has. Indeed, Harold Ramos' Igor in &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; had it wrong twenty years ago:  The printed word is NOT dead. Neither is the need for the humble comma, well-placed.
6305882592|5.0|Harold and Maude is an insightful, comedic and touching view of two individuals who are seemingly polar opposites.  Ashby, the director, reminds the viewer that in death there is life and in life there is death and having a sense of humor is the best, if not the only antidote to both phenomena.  <br />As many have mentioned, with a few dissenters, this is truly a wonderful film, full of irony and paradoxes.  One falls in love with the characters and thus the film.  Cat Stephens' haunting music provides a perfect soundscape to a film that will haunt<BR>your memory for all time.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This movie is one of the most charming films that have come out in a long time.  The intertwining plots make it much more intriguing than others, and it's love stories along with the heart break is so intense and true you can identify with each situation one way or another.  A beautiful film, and fantastic cast.

This album goes a long way from rap to rock, its very different, and no matter what songs you heard out of it, you should know that you wont find two similar song on this, well maybe the ballads only. Besides X-Tina's great voice makes this album even better, she's got it all, no doubt about it!

B0000CDLA7|5.0|Its easy to run this one down. Why? Simply because DT haven't tried to deliberate yet another SFAM. They did that with 6DOIT and probably felt that they were getting stuck in their own spectacular groove of mindless progression. Train of Thought, hence is natural progression. They pretty nearly missed a wall with this one, and you fans wouldn't have been a very pleasant bunch if that had happened. Think about it. And regarding nu-metal or whatever garb they call it- it is quite demeaning to place TOT along those pungent lines. All the tracks here are great. Not one is below the DT par. Take another shot at it. Look at it from another plane of thought. You've got to...cos' times are changing and this train is constantly travelling. Look what happened to Metallica. A few years down the line, when DT deliver a real turkey (if they do cos every body does)look back and be bold enough to spin it with a lot of pride. You can still do that.
B000002UAU|5.0|I used to be highly critical of critics' adoration of The Beatles, until I sat down and really listened to their stuff.  I had heard songs by the Beatles but I had never sat down and listened to any albums by them.  The songs that I was familiar with were not that impressive to me, so I thought that these critics must surely be speaking out of some blind nostalgic devotion, to the group that evoked the most pleasurable memories from their youth.  I've been listening to The Beatles for about eight months now, and I must say that I would put two albums by them in my own personal top ten of all time.  I was not born until the mid to late 70's so I was not around to experience Beatle mania and, I did not grow up listening to their music so I am surely not speaking out of nostalgia.  I listened to this album for the first time about 4 months ago and I must say, with the exception of \\"A day in the life\\", I was not immediately impressed.  I could sense that there was something extremely impressive going on, but it did not immediately click with me.  I had to listen to this album at least four times before it began to sink in.  This album truly is a wonderful work of art and you have to listen to it with that mindset in order to truly appreciate it.  You have to sit back, let go, allow yourself to drift away in the experience and enjoy the head-trip.  The first song is a great straightforward hard-hitting rock and roll song that sort of preps you for the rest of the ride.  The ascension truly begins with the second song, \\"With a little help from my friends\\".  I was familiar with an alternate version of this song that was performed by Joe Cocker and I did not know that The Beatles had written and performed it first (the fact that I am familiar with Cocker's version from watching \\"The Wonder Years\\" really shows my age).  Their original had to grow on me but now it is one of my favorite songs on the album.  \\"Lucy in the sky with Diamonds\\" is like a bright and colorful psychedelic head-trip.  \\"Getting Better\\" is also one of my favorite songs on here.  I love the irony of the way that John Lennon says 'it can't get no worse', balancing out the otherwise sunny and optimistic tone of the song with a dose of realism.  \\"Fixing a hole\\" is basically a metaphor for something having to do with the writer's state of mind.  It sounds as if he is coming to grips with his internal inclinations and accepting and fully embracing his uniqueness, not allowing the opinions of more conventional thinkers to seep in and put a \\"damper\\" on things:-).  \\"She's leaving home\\" is one of the most tragic and beautiful songs that I have ever heard.  It is basically a tale about a girl sneaking out of the house, which tears her family apart.  The Beatles do a great job of making you really feel the humanity of each of the characters in the story without implicating or placing blame on any one of them.  \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!\\" is a pretty strange and trippy song about a circus or carnival act.  I've seen a picture of the circus flyer that this song is based on, and it is a true testament to Lennon's genius that he could make such a unique and creative song based on a flyer.  \\"Within you Without you\\" is the most poignant song on the album.  This Harrison song which prominently features the sitar is basically several of life's greatest and wisest lessons summed up into one song. \\"When I'm sixty four\\" is a pretty catchy song fashioned in the style of an old movie showtune.  \\"Lovely Rita\\" is another one of my favorites.  The lyrics are kind of silly but the music is outstanding.  \\"Good Morning\\" is a boisterous hard hitting rocker with brassy marching band horns that finds Lennon hilariously taking a snide swipe at the hopelessly mundane routines that define most our lives, and the little bit of joy and pleasure that we get when we are finally \\"freed\\" at 5 O'clock :-). It was also a really good idea to reprise the intro at this point.  There is not one bad song on here, but I must say that this album's sum is much greater than a few of its individual parts.  There are a number of Beatles albums with a larger number of stand-alone singles, but none of those albums add up to the brilliance of this one.  Every song on here is good but \\"A day in the Life\\" still strikes the deepest chord with me.  This song is so profound and well put together that it sends chills down my spine.  I was quite skeptical at first but I have to conclude that this truly is a great album, and I would strongly recommend it to anyone with an open mind that's ready to explore far reaching sonic territory.
B0001WTUH6|5.0|*UNDERWORLD: Uncut Extended Cut(2-disc version)*<br />I spent $25 more dollars expecting all kinds of additional footage that would give more story line and more plot twists and more action...AT LEAST 24 MINUTES OF EXTRA MOVIE, according to a sticker on the front cover. To quote the back cover, \\"...the battle for supremacy never before seen by human eyes, until now!\\". WELL, I'VE PUT BOTH MOVIES IN AND CONCLUDED THERE'S ROUGHLY 8 MINUTES OF ADDITIONAL FOOTAGE, NEVER BEFORE SEEN BY HUMANS EYES, NOT 24 MINUTES OF THE BATTLE FOR SUPREMACY NEVER BEFORE SEEN BEFORE HUMAN EYES!!! Where's the missing 16 minutes? What a rip-off!!!<br />I believe an explination is in order.<br />However, I love the extras on the uncut 2 disc version, there is much more of that. Great job there. The case has a very neat 2 cover artwork trick. The 2 booklets are pretty cool, too, but none of that is the main reason I forked over $25 more bucks.<br />In final...I guess my main complaint is the FALSE ADVERTISMENT of the additional 24 minutes! I still give it 5 stars, but I'm writing this review as a heads up for those who are looking for alot more in the actual movie itself, it's just not there.
0393317552|1.0|It is sad nowadays how hard white liberals and minorities go out of their way to make whitey the evil one.   How sad it is that certain minorities hold onto this fiction as a reason for their lack of 'social progress&quot;.<br />I don't believe in the &quot;bell curve&quot;.  I don't believe that white people are the problem either.<br />So called progress is really in the eyes of the beholder and their culture.  When I have visited the so called &quot;underdeveloped&quot; countries, I found that those that would call themselves minorities here were actually living lives that I envied.  I found that because they held onto values and practices for hundreds of years, they were much more at peace than western man.<br />This author is an elitist while attempting to create an excuse for cultures that didn't &quot;develop&quot; like white people.  How can you say that the white way is the right way?<br />I have found greater values in the cultures found in Latin and African societies that have been less tainted by western values that destroy the land.  Look at our lives that are consumed by trinkets.  We care more about trinkets than about raising our own children.  The double income family wants trinkets over having an actual family unit.<br />Compare that to the so called undeveloped nations.  Why is it that white elitists think that it is good when other nations are given the same burdens that we have created for ourselves? Aren't they holding our culture as advanced and then painting it with guilt so that they can feel superior to others?
0451169514|3.0|I really enjoyed this book and have re read it over and over again despite it's lengths. I agree with many of the reviews in that it does get boring in the middle where King spends endless time talking about this and that about Derry which really makes you want to skip it and get back to the characters, who I thought were all interesting and well developed.<br />This book really scared me, but I have cat's whiskers for nerves and I can't think of one King book that didn't scare me so perhaps I am not the most discriminating when it comes to what is scary?<br />But my MAIN problem with this story was *SPOILER SPOILER* the last part of the book with the sex scene between the 11 year old children. And it wasn't even just regular sex, it was a gang bang with one girl having sex with 6 boys. How can an 11 year old girl take 6 boys on at once? I don't know grown women who can do that, and more to the point WHY DID STEPHEN KING PUT THAT IN THERE? It was justified as a way to bring everyone back together, but I honestly believe that there must have been some other way and I found myself feeling as though I was being molested by this scene because of the age of the children, and I am not shy about sexuality in literature. It just had no place.<br />Also what was up with Bill getting to have his way with Bev when they became adults too? All the boys loved her, why was Bill chosen (and he already had a wife) and then RIGHT after Bev has sex with Bill she walks off with Ben...it just was tasteless.<br />*end spoiler*<br />Also there was never a real explanation of what It was or how the kids managed to hurt It. Everything just was. Nothing was explained as good as it should've been in the end.<br />Other than that, the book was very good, like I said very well developed and even if you don't find it scary (which is hard for me to imagine) the story of friendship and childhood to adulthood will at least be interesting and intriguing and the book is hard to put down. I found myself in a lounge chair on hot summer days reading it for hours on end till the sun went down.<br />An enjoyable read, just a lot of questions and questionable activities that never seeemed justified.in a lounge chair on hot summer days reading it for hours on end till the sun went down.<br />An enjoyable read, just a lot of questions and questionable activities that never seeemed justified.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|I never watched this show when it was on the air but since I am in withdrawal from Angel's cancellation (which stung since this season was so good) I decided to check this out. Joss Wehedon is a master of his craft and I enjoyed watching this. There is your expected Whedon humor and I wasn't really convinced of how much I liked the show until I saw the eps 'Jaynestown' and 'Out of Gas'. The acting is very good and the effects are great as well. I completely agree with those who say if you like 'Buffy' and 'Angel' you should give this a look.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I think that this CD of hers is better than ever before, the lyrics are not the best for some of the songs But songs like  ''My Happy ending'' and &quot;Take Me Away&quot; are really good  Rock songs with great music.<BR> Songs Like &quot;Together&quot; (Which talks about loneliness) and &quot;Nobody's Home&quot; (which talks about fear of growing up) I feel are the best songs off the record. But you can't leave behind &quot;Slipped Away&quot; which was written by Avril.<BR>     The Highlight of this album is &quot;He Wasn't&quot; and &quot;Forgotten&quot; which are really good songs.<BR>     And Like I said the lyrics are not the best but the album itself is a hit. Another point for Avril !!!. I would buy the Cd again if mine breaks.Believe me. It IS all that.
0743454529|5.0|This book drew me in from page one and kept me intrigued to the very end.  Even after I finished, I couldn't stop thinking about it.  I have not had a book affect me like that for a long time - if ever!  I immediately loaned my copy to my mom and have recommended it to many more people.<BR>I have read everything Jodi Picoult has written and think she is an awesome writer!
B0001UL7RY|5.0|this CD is 10x better than the first. the songs have more catchy guitar riffs and it's all around great head banging music. there are many up beat and catchy songs and then there are the rockin out songs. i would recomend this CD to anyone and everyone. if you don't buy this CD your missing out on some awesome music!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|If you are a pseudo-intellectual, this is your film. You will be wowed by the lack of plot, the paper-thin character development, and the bored, vacant expressions on the characters' faces, which you will no doubt ascribe to their deep understanding of the timeless misery of the human experience.<br />But if you are like me and just want to enjoy a movie without hollow pretense, save your money. At least I rented this one!
0440180295|5.0|&quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; was my first introduction to Kurt Vonnegut in the novel form.  I had read a few of his short stories and was already impressed with his status as a writer.  I would've never expected what I experienced when I read &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five.&quot;  It's hard to put into words that'll actually do this masterpiece the justice it deserves, but I will try.<br />Listen:  Billy Pilgrim has become unstuck in time.  This meaning that he relives certain moments of his life in random order like a scrambled movie.  He has absolutely no control over it whatsoever and he never knows what part of his life he'll have to reenact.  The majority of the moments that we witness take place during his involvement in WW2 as a POW and also when he is taken aboard an alien spaceship with creatures known as &quot;Tralfamadorians.&quot;  There is no ending for Billy Pilgrim.  He witnesses his beginning as well as death... and then the show starts all over again in a continuous loop throwing Pilgrim into random segments of his life.<br />Reading this novel was a completely new experience to me.  I had never read anything like it, and now I know that I will never again read anything like it, as there is no way the book can be successfully duplicated by others.  Vonnegut is able to take a serious matter (such as war) and still throw in a balanced sense of humor that will take you by surprise.  The book pokes fun at just about anything you can imagine while still showing respect and care to the main subject matter.  The story is outrageously subtle and unpredictable.  This novel is a very easy read and once you begin it, you won't want to put it down until you have finished it.  Vonnegut is one talented writer with a very unique sense of style that I have never witnessed in any other book.<br />One thing that people will probably dislike about the book is how confusing it can be at times.  Since the book jumps around and is not in order, you have to always be thinking and paying attention to every detail.  It's very easy to forget what has already happened and what has yet to happen since it is in scrambled order.  However, this is what really makes the book that much more special.  You'll want to reread it again for this very reason, as you'll most likely miss a few things with the first read.  It wasn't very hard for me to keep track of what was going on since I found the book to be so involving.<br />While this is indeed a classic, because of the strange manner that the book is written in, it will most likely not appeal to everybody.  This is a risk-taking work of literature that is bound to not have everybody loving it.  Still, I think it's worth anybody's time to pick it up and give it a chance.  &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; is a rare find that will keep you on your toes throughout the entire time.  You'll never know what to expect next.  A very touching, funny, sad and dark story about a flawed entity known as &quot;human-beings.&quot;  This has very quickly become a new favorite of mine, without question. -Michael Craneng and paying attention to every detail.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I have been a fan of Joss Whedon's since Buffy tvs first hit the air. His characters were original and well rounded.  His stories were very good. After first hearing of his new series being aired on fox television I was extatic. And again This new show was amazing the best new show of that year.  Fox had managed to kill off dark angel in order to get this show and then I came to find that the high mucky mucks of th television  studio had decided to not support their only sci-fi venture.  The DVD set has all the episodes and three that were never aired. I highly recomend this to anyone looking for something original and innovative.  And for those loyal browncoats this will tide you over untill the new movie in '05.
B000002USN|5.0|JUST WHEN YOU WOULD THINK THAT THE 40'S, 50'S, 60'S OR EVEN 70'S WERE THE BEST YEARS OF FRANK SINATRA. HE SUPRISED US ALL BY COMING OUT WITH THIS GREAT CD IN THE 90'S (WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM HIS FRIENDS). THE BEST SONGS THAT I LIKE ARE &quot;SUMMER WIND&quot;, &quot;NEW YORK, NEW YORK&quot;, &quot;GUESS I'LL HANG MY TEARS OUT TO DRY / IN THE WEE SMALL HOURS OF THE MORNING&quot;, &quot;WITCHCRAFT&quot; AND &quot;I'VE GOT YOU UNDER MY SKIN&quot;. FRANK SINATRA'S VOICE (DESPITE BEING IN HIS LATE 70'S AT THE TIME) SHOWED NO APPRECIABLE LOSS OF THE GREAT SINATRA VOICE OF THE 1960'S. THE GRAND MASTER HIMSELF SINGING WITH THESE GREAT YOUNGER ARTISTS LIKE LUTHER VANDROSS, JULIO IGLESIAS, CARLY SIMON, ANITA BAKER AND BONO. I THOUGHT THAT WAS SO NEAT!
B00006L83N|2.0|When I first heard Symphony X, I was bored. I'm a musician myself, and I must say, they have technical talent. Yet, if you consider songwriting skill, they are unoriginal and lack any flavor. If you combine Dream Theater, Pantera, and Yngvie, you get Symphony X. With Yngvie, it was proven that neoclassical is just a pointless heap of exaggeration with weak musical substance. The point is, this album no better than V, which was overall boring as well. Odessey's long epic rips-off Dream Theater, and then precedes to be monotonous. The rest is just, well, Symphony X. Nice try, not good enough.
B0000BYM3K|1.0|This is the fastest I've seen a new Maiden album hit the discount section. Steve and c/o show a complete lack of effort, making DoD a horrible descent into self parody. Prepare yourself for lots of lame bass intros, (an idea used repeatedly by Maiden since the early ninties), musical phrases borrowed from Bnw and X factor and a terrible production. The title track is laughable and so wretched musically and lyrically that I told myself, \\"they must be joking\\" when I heard their attempt at a Blackmore's Night style \\"dance around the campfire\\" part which sounds completely gay. Ready yourself to be \\"entertained\\" by choruses where once again they insist on repeating long and awkward lines ad nauseam. Example: Montsegur which contains the memorable line:<br />At the gates! And the walls! Of Montseguuuur!!! Blood on the stones of the citadel! <br />On Paschendale they try to make a plain, unimaginative song sound powerful by playing cheap orchestral style keyboard. The only song worth listening to without pressing the stop button on your cd player half way through is Journeyman, although this too is weak by Maiden standards. <br />I have noticed that this is the very first Maiden album to be available on discount around here, so I know I'm not the only one. I seen the same opinion online from hundred's of diehard Maiden fans, although you can also find sheep who will accept anything Maiden releases. So save your money and avoid this album. I have never felt this moved to write a online review before, so you will understand that I mean very much every  word I say. As a huge Maiden fan let me tell you that I passionately believe this album sucks in a big way. There is no hope. Buy everything Maiden has released, even Virtual XI. But not this one. Don't you do it.
0446310786|5.0|I read this book in my freshmen english class in high school.  No other book comes close to this one.  This is definitely my favorite book.  I'm glad that high school english classes introduced me to reading classics.  I don't think that I would've read this book if it were not assigned.  I liked how the book is told in Scout's perspective.  Both the book and the movie are great.  If you haven't read this, READ IT NOW!  This should be on everyone's reading list.
B000002UAU|4.0|You've gotta hand it to the Beatles: They were never willing to let the music get old. Nothing they ever did, either here or on other albums, was repetative or unoriginal.<BR>    Sgt Pepper's reflects that perfectly. On this record alone, the Beatles dabble in phsycadelia, Indian Sitar, String-laced ballads, vochalized LSD trips, and straight up rock.<BR>    The album kicks off with Paul's upbeat rocker/ title track, followed by the slower, tuneful ballad &quot;With a little help from my friends.&quot; My favorite track &quot;Lucy in the sky with diamonds,&quot; is next. It's John Lenon's magnum opus, a brilliant sonic texture loaded with eerie guitars, lofty fuzz bass, and fantastic lyrics tinged with LSD imigary (&quot;Picture yourself on a boat on a river, with tangarine trees, and marmalade skys/ Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly, a girl with kalaidascope eyes...&quot;).<BR>    After that comes &quot;Getting better,&quot; a rather by-the-numbers rocker which offers nothing special, though it is an entertaining listen. I rather like &quot;Fixing a hole,&quot; a slower, percussian driven song with clever words and a great tune. &quot;She's leaving home,&quot; is a sad and moving ballad, driven by George's Sitar and tragic violen in the background, along with poetic narrative lyrics, all of which build up to a magestic chorus.<BR>   &quot;Being for the benifit of Mr. Kite!&quot; is the reason this album only gets four stars. It's far, far, FAR too gimmicky, with irritating carnival themed lyrics, monotonous drummings, and boring phsycdelic interludes.<BR>   &quot;Within you without you,&quot; is another Harrison-drivin sitar ballad which is also quite good, and more spirited than &quot;She's leaving home.&quot; After that comes &quot;When I'm sixty-four,&quot; &quot;Lovely Rita,&quot; and &quot;Good morning, Good morning,&quot; all of which are essentially filler, forgettable despite their merits.<BR>  Which leads us to the reprise of the title track, fueled by Ringo's energetic drumming. Otherwise, the song is a shorter version of its counterpart, and not terribly interesting.<BR>  And all of that builds up to the album's amazing climax, the epic ballad &quot;A day in the life,&quot; a wonderful, poetic, dreamy, and shocking tune that sums up not only the whole record, but the brilliance of the Beatles as well.<BR>    All in all, Sgt. Pepper's lonely Hearts club band is definatley worth the money to buy it, and it definatley belongs in your collection. It is not however, the best of the Beatles' albums. (See: Revolver, Rubber Soul, Abby Road.)
