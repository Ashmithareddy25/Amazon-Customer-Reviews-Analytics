B00006CXSS|5.0|Great series and well documented.  Everyone should have to watch these movies to see what sacrifices soldiers went through to allow us the freedoms we have in this country.
B000JBXXZ4|5.0|It really grabs you and doesn't let go.  This album is 10x better than there last release.  It's a lot more experimental and takes risks but they seem to pull it off.  I hated Dig, Love Hurts, and Earth to Bella but now those 3 songs really start to grow on you and you can't help but listen to the whole cd.  The best songs on the album are A Kiss to Send Us Off, Anna Molly, Rogues, and of course Light Grenades but one must listen to this whole cd to really appreciate.  At first it doesn't sound like any incubus record and you wonder what happened to them but if you give it some time it really becomes very addictive and you can't listen to just one song on the record.  I would say this is one of the best cds of 2006 as 2006 was a very disappointing year for music in general.  To me Incubus gets better and better on every record and to me A Crow Left of the Murder was very disappointing but this gives me hope that Incubus can last another 10 years or so writiing great music can't wait for the next release.
B000GY729M|1.0|Trust me.... I was really pulling for Brandon Flowers to rock this album as he did the first, but I was sadly disappointed. There are a couple of reasons for this. 1- His voice is all over the place. No matter how good of a voice you have, if it is all over the place, and erratic, it still just sounds like noise. 2- The songs just plain suck. I have listened to this album all the way through at least 5 times, and I'm just not seeing it. I don't know how someone could possibly compare this album to the first. The quality, sound and overall experience are not even close to that of Hot Fuss. For everyone contemplating purchasing this album, keep your money in your pocket, and wait to see what comes next. Hopefully you have better luck next time boys.
B00003CX9E|1.0|If this movies underlying theme was Kanes loss of his youth and innocence symbolized by his sled, and that it affected his later behavior, then they did a terrible job conveying that on screen.  <br />  Kane didnt seem all that distraught by having his wealth and power. He didnt seem regretfull that he had allowed his life to lean this way. The people he interated with gave more clues to the man then Orson Welles wooden performance. All I saw was a man who wanted to do good and burned out early and yet I didnt feel none of the passion of someone of his position and abilities should have radiated on the screen.   <br />
1401308201|5.0|The \\"Grimmerie\\" book serves as a wonderful remembrance of the play as seen on Broadway.  It would also serve as excellent reading prior to actually seeing the play.  It contains great pictures and fascinating facts about the history of the book \\"Wicked\\", the author and of the production.
B000GDH9JQ|4.0|I know you're out there. Those of you who view the movie \\"White Nights\\" as just another poorly acted, melodramatic dance movie. But think again.     Yes, White Nights has a lot of dancing in it. Spectacular dancing, I might add, especially Mikhail Baryshnikov in the opening scene. (He's got some pretty strong neck muscles) But, White Nights is so much more than just dancing. The characters in this movie are believable. Baryshnikov, Gregory Hines, Isabella Rossellini, just to name some, truly put flesh and blood into their roles. The role of Chaiko, played by Jerzy Skolimowski, seemed a little one-dimensional, but even he did okay. And while the plot doesn't offer a whole lot of twists and turns, it's still fun to watch.    I also enjoyed White Nights because, without getting too preachy, it discusses the challenges of living under both a communist regime and an open society. Even with the freedoms we enjoy here in the United States, we still face difficult issues such as racism and government mistrust. Everyone's perspective though is different, and the film does a fine job in going over this issue.    I did however, find it odd that the three main characters in \\"Whie Nights\\" were always playing loud music in their apartment, so as to drown out the noise of what they were saying and doing. You would think that those spying on them would get the hint, pretty early on, that Baryshnikov, Hines and Rossellini, were up to something sneaky. Oh well!     With the collapse of the Soviet Union, some might think \\"Whie Nights\\" is dated, but I don't think so. Just watching the performances in this movie, such as those by Gregory Hines and Geraldine Page, two actors who left this world way too soon, makes it all worth it.
B000J3EEBY|1.0|Loreena McKennitt has a marvelous voice but it's largely lost in this grab bag of Arabic instrumentals and Egyptian deedle-deedle dance hall chrome.  Loreena is at her best in the haunting Penelope's Song, but track 8 is more than reminiscent of the melody in \\"Bonny Swans\\" and there is other occasional recycled music themes from earlier albums as well.  Girl, having thoroughly explored middle eastern music, please may we move on?  Pharoah's Daughter and others already own this niche.
0375505091|5.0|Spectacular image quality, good collection of her work over time, extremely interesting to look at.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|I received \\"An Ancient Muse\\" for Christmas, & it is one of my favorite gifts. Loreena's beautiful voice & the bewitching melodies/rythms transport you to another world entirely. The best songs are hard to pinpoint, but I was able to narrow it down to 2: Caravanserai & The Gates of Istanbul. While the cd seems short (9 songs total), most of the songs are long, & it really isn't a tragedy to have to play the cd over. :-)
B00013RC66|5.0|This is an almost classic movie. However, its not for everyone. This one was used as a gift.
1400064287|5.0|I'm currently writing a business novel. As I read a review copy of Made to Stick I realised that there were several areas where I needed to tweak my own story to make it stickier (more interesting and memorable).  <br /> <br />Made to Stick is a short book, full of fascinating, simple and concrete stories.  It is an easy to read.   I wish I'd read it 10 years ago.
0679805273|5.0|As always, this Dr. Seuss book sends a wonderful message.  It is a fantastic gift for graduates, or anyone moving on or up in life.  It is also fantastic for weddings, bridal showers, etc.... I personally purchased the book for a wedding.  I wrote a message inside the cover, and then purchased a variety of gift cards for the couple. (Places they could actually go- the movies, restaurants, activities, etc.)  Then I taped a gift card on every other page... it was a great gift and well received!!!
032147404X|5.0|This book is great for any beginner in the field of photography...Scott Kelby makes the book interesting and easy to understand. He includes Nikon and Canon settings when you need to know how to set a camera for certain setups, etc.
B000K7VHQE|4.0|Little Miss is irreverent, silly, sweet, hysterically funny, touching, goofy and one of the best feel-good movies of 2006. An unlikely contestant in an unlikely contest with an unlikely entourage of relatives who are either emotional messes (brother and uncle), emotionally immature (dad and grandpa) or steadfastly put-upon (mom and little miss sunshine) embark on a journey which will leave all of them touched in some way forever. <br /> <br />If you think your family is quirky, they have nothing on Little Miss Sunshine's family. <br /> <br />Pop some popcorn, grab a drink, and sit down and enjoy the ride. And try not to fall out of your chair laughing. <br /> <br />A special call-out for the best use so far of a Rick James hit.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|I had to write as there are so many nuetral or even negative reviews here.  This CD is nothing short of fantastic, it is like brand new Beatle material.  If you do not love the Beatles leave it and them alone, if you do be prepared for a wonderful journey.  I still play Beatle music everyday (along with a solid mix of everything else).  But I can tell you in all these years I could count on my fingers how many times I played the original Let it Be!  Not a Beatle Album!!!  This is.  The Beatles had little to do with creation and production of the original.  This has them and Apple all over it.  I can not tell you how many times I have played it.  Many. many, many.  And I will keep playing it.  Put on those headphone and give it a try ... you can skip Get Back, you have heard that ... but then get ready to travel.  I promise you will enjoy every minute.  JLT
B000F9RB94|3.0|SWAT has some awesome video shots in 1080p. The audio is bold. <br /> <br />The movie is non stop action. <br /> <br />I have 3 Sony Blu-ray units displaying on a Sony 1080p LCD, a Pioneer 1080p Plasma & a Sony 1080p projection unit. The video is awesome on all three.
B00000HYXB|5.0|I love Blind Guardian very much. I love Tolkien very much. I love the Simarillion very much. And yet I was still unprepared for the utter awesomeness that this album carries inside a small disc of alloy. Many claim that Imaginations from the Other Side is Blind Guardian's ultimate album. I disagree: that award goes to Nightfall in Middle-earth! <br /> <br />War of Wrath: Excellent. Depicting Morgoth conversing with Sauron and sending him off to Middle-earth. Great voice acting and the battle SFX in the beginning are something I'd expect from Manowar. (Manowar: It's really something we wanted to do.) <br /> <br />Into The Storm: The best godsdamned opening you will ever find. It opens both the album and BG's live concerts flawlessly. Very enjoyable riffs and lyrics that stands the hairs on the back of my neck on end. <br /> <br />Lammoth: It's Morgoth. And he's...screaming. Yeah. ...neat. And...the wind is blowing, zomg. <br /> <br />Nightfall: This song about the Noldor's departure from Valinor brings up images of a world on the brink, contains the best choir I've seen, and is the only song capable of rivalling Valhalla as the favorite live BG song. There's nothing about this song to dislike, and it's more and more proof that a metal band like BG can do melancholy and non-metal music. <br /> <br />The Minstrel: I assume this is Feanor talking, and it tells us one thing: He has no idea what he's doing. <br /> <br />The Curse of Feanor: One of my top 5 BG songs of all time. \\" <br /> <br />Morgoth I cry <br />all hope is gone but I swear revenge <br />in my oath <br />I will take part <br />IN YOUR DAMNED FATE <br /> <br />Captured: I think we all owe BG a big thank you for bringing to us Morgoth's evil laugh, because it is awesome. <br /> <br />Blood Tears: A phenomenal song. It's melancholy and holds your interest through the entire song. The chorus is emotion-stirring, and the opening stanzas just reel you in. Plus it contains my favorite line to quote ever: Welcometo where time stands still  <br />no one leaves and no one ever will <br /> <br />Mirror Mirror: If it were possible to distill pure, unadaultrated awesome into a song and project it into your ears so that you want nothing more than to stand up and start singing along at the top of your lungs, it - oh, wait, they've already done that with Mirror Mirror. Quite possibly the best chorus ever concieved, an excellent opening riff, and lyrics that stay with you after hearing only a couple times, and just....don't ask me to put how great this song is into words, I'm only a mortal man, I can't do it.  <br />Mirror, mirror on the wall  <br />true hope lies beyond the coast  <br />you're a damned kind can't you see  <br />that the winds will change <br /> <br />Face The Truth: This one has to be my favorite narrative. It's pretty deep, and sums up the Noldor's current situation (I.E. completely screwed) really well. <br /> <br />Noldor(Dead Winter Reigns): Another hit. In my opinion, the best melancholy song on the album. It's a unique combination of melancholy and power metal. Each part of the song has its own style, always leading back up to the fantastic chorus. The end brings out a sudden bit of piano that just ends the song in the absolute best possible way. <br /> <br />Battle of Sudden Flame: An interesting narrative-style piece that actually sounds a bit like a rejected sound clip from Nightfall. It's quite good, with a neat flute in the background. <br /> <br />Time Stands Still(At The Iron Hill):  <br /> <br />The fate of us all  <br />lies deep in the dark  <br />when time stands still at the i-ron hill <br /> <br />A fantastic chorus, unique and very enjoyable music, and a live hit. The only song that can challenge Mirror Mirror and some freaking awesome music to play while playing Battle For Middle-earth 2. These and more describe Time Stands Still. You will put it on repeat for hours. This is not a prediction or an expectation. It is a fact. <br /> <br />The Dark Elf: DUN DUN DUUUN. <br /> <br />Thorn: This is an interesting, rather melancholy song about bad consience. It takes some time to grow on you, but once it does it's excellent. Yet more unique music and vocals, and some very, very nice cooperation between drums and guitar. <br /> <br />The Eldar: This song deserves a mention simply because it's unbelievable that Hansi Kursch can sing this high, nay, that any metal singer can go this high. If you played a song from Imaginations From The Other Side, and then this song, most people would not believe that it was the same band and same singer. It's a very good song with some excellent keyboard work. <br /> <br />Nom The Wise: A mournful goodbye to one of the finest of the Noldor, and also a strange contrast to the next song. <br /> <br />When Sorrow Sang: This song is precisely the opposite of what it looks like. With a name like that, you'd expect another melancholy song, huh? Wrong. This one is pure power metal. It doesn't make it a bad song, it's just kind of wierd in my opinion. Good beat, nice lyrics, excellent chorus as always. <br /> <br />Out On The Water: Another sad narrative-ish piece. Nothing special. <br /> <br />The Steadfast: Morgoth appears to be very pleased with himself. Jackass. <br /> <br />A Dark Passage: This one took me a while to get into, but it's an excellent song.  <br />Deep in his castle he said,  <br />All land be mine <br />there's one thing for sure  <br />the triuph of shadow is near <br />Deep in his castle they sang <br />We shall not rest until all will be thine <br />All land is mine <br />you can be sure <br />don't dare me the mighty one screamed <br /> <br />Final Chapter(Thus Ends): This one isn't too good. Why is that? Because it's the end of the album. Just kidding. This is a fine narrative, explaining the conclusion of the Simarillion and almost sounding like it's describing Aragorn...but I don't think that's too likely. <br /> <br />There's only one bad thing I have to say about Nightfall in Middle-earth. On the album cover: Morgoth's taste in entertainment leaves something to be desired.
B000001ES9|5.0|The album that started it all. Working Man, one of their most popular tracks, appears on this album at the end, which finishes this piece off well. My #1 all-time favorite Rush song is \\"In The Mood\\". \\"Before and After\\" is like foreshadowing of many of their longer tracks, and is another favorite. <br /> <br />It's rough and raw and I love this CD!! Crank it!!
B000GIXEIG|4.0|Not having read the original I had very little idea of the storyline, but I thoroughly enjoy classic tales and mythology. I expect the movie has updated some of the story and maybe embellished some parts somewhat but I enjoyed the movie and by the end you feel quite sorry for the giant troll. If you are into movies like Troy and Alexander then you will probably enjoy this movie.
0307346609|5.0|Many in the mainstream have reviewed this book as a piece of humor.  Just because the author's last name is Brooks (Mel's son) doesn't mean it is a laugh-fest.  Yes, there are moments of extreme black comedy.  But overall, this is a horror fans dream!  This is an epic that gives thinking horror fans  what we've been waiting for - respect.  Finally, a piece of horror fiction that doesn't talk down to the reader.  What we have been given is a gift.  A gift worthy of multiple reads.
B000G1ALRK|5.0|I find the songs to be entertaining and thought provoking.  He is on track to a great career.
B000HEZF0O|5.0|All three MI Movies has great video shots in 1080p. The audio is superb. <br /> <br />This is the way all \\"series/ sequel\\" movies such as Lethal Weapon, Jaws, Star Wars, Indiana Jones, etc should be packaged for Blu-Ray. <br /> <br />I have 3 Sony Blu-ray units displaying on a Sony 1080p LCD, a Pioneer 1080p Plasma & a Sony 1080p projection unit. The video is awesome on all three.
068987474X|2.0|I was entertained for sure, many of the scenarios were like deja vu for me. But unfortunately I found one major flaw. It's WRONG. Sometimes its not that their not into you, so much as not really the romantic types, somewhat socially inept, shy, LAZY is a big one. My husand was lazy. He never treated me badly, but he probably failed at least 5 of these little tests of Gregs. We got married, he is now deceased, but beyond that it was a successful relationship. I didn't pursue him doggedly, but I was probably more the persuer and he found that to be a turn-on. Now being single again, i've encountered several guys that just weren't into me. This book assumes that us ladies are stupid. Were not, we know this, we know when a guy isn't that into us. Sometimes we pathetically try anyway, sometimes we let go at the appropriate time, but SOMETIMES these guys fail many of these tests of Greg's and they ARE that into you, just for some reason or another they aren't doing what they should be. Women are capable of the same thing, I've lost guys that I was very interested in, cuz i was just out of a relationship and I was still hung up on the EX. I wanted to be attentive, but I couldn't be, cuz I was hung up. Greg says this is simply not a possible scenario, that if you like them that stuff won't matter. WRONG! Greg likes to make everything very cut and dried, saying if he liked you he would do blah blah blah. It's just not that simple, just like it's not that simple with women. Unfortunately the book bummed me out, made me feel like I should just sit here and wait for Mister Wonderful. I'm a doer, not a wait n see-er and frankly I shouldn't be forced to wait around. Maybe it's why I'm not yet married, but I wouldn't bet on that.
0618680004|2.0|I wonder if this rant against religion is based on the fear of uncertainty that Dawkins often rails against. If so, Dawkins is doing a disservice both to atheism and religion.<br /><br />He fails to recognize that science, philosophy, religion, and morality now all have the same starting point: doubt. Things are not what they seem.<br /><br />Scientists today are the first to recognize that all their findings are provisional, contingent, and transitional. Like Kant and Hume before them, they have come to deal with the limits of human knowledge.<br /><br />Any philosopher can tell you that the God hypothesis can neither be proven or disproven. That is why Dawkins' atheism is at once a matter of faith and choice, just like belief.<br /><br />His arguments are just a waste of time. It is no longer our business to ask people if they share our values or believe as we do. Our business is to ask if they are suffering and how we can help.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|This short movie is an absolute requirement for the Christmas season. I can remember the first time that we saw it over in England when my son was five and how he cried at the ending. But we still watch it each Christmas now with our grandchildren,and now we have it on DVD we will continue to enjoy the movie probably some day with great grandchildren. Their is no dialogue, the movie doesn't need it, just the haunting music that seems to fit perfectly. This is an absolute must have, compulsory viewing for all kids (and adults) during the holiday season.
B000GFLE86|4.0|Although I like \\"Careless Love\\" better, this is an awesome album. She has an incredible voice and unique way of performing.
B0007OCG4W|5.0|This movie was quite a surprise. It kept my focus the entire time. What a great cast and their performances were fantastic. Great movie for adults!!!
B000GFLAI0|4.0|What can I say?  I'm a Dylan fan and this album has some very good new music to enjoy.
B000F3AAUW|1.0|The only song I liked was Crazy.  All others are a bit bizarre.
B000A6T262|4.0|If you love Star Trek movies this is the set for you.I also like the companion disk with all the interviews and background material,quite a deal for 10 movies and 10 bonus disk.
B00005JG6Q|5.0|This movie is timeless. The characters are easy to relate to and the animation is so flawless you would have a hard time figuring out it was released in the 80's. Otomo's view of the future it's so fascinating you will wonder why they made only one movie.
B000FIMG68|5.0|Not only is the commercial free television production (which is shot to film) remarkable, but the DVD technology, organization and extra features make this an all-time great to watch again and again. I own Season One also, and expect to purchase the commercial free viewing and extra DVD features Season Three as soon as it is avaialable.<br /><br />Truly JJ and crew of lost have found great writing!
0385513755|5.0|I really like the Da Vinci Code illustrated version.  This book has a lot to offer and the pictures help explain a story that can be rather deep for some readers.  If purchasing the book, I highly recommend the illustrated version.

B000007ODY|5.0|No matter who plays, Brahms always satisfies. This edition, however, is superlative! Highly recommend.
B0000AUHPK|4.0|Probably the most romantic/tragic movie I've ever watched.  Leaves the Laurence Olivier et.al. version for dead. (That movie finished half way through the book). Ralph Fienne's tortured and damged Heathcliffe is mesmerising, but WHO cast Sinaid O'Connor for Christ's sake??? And Binoche as Cathy is of course \\"haunting\\"-(sorry couldnt help it!!!) The eponymous scenery and the music score stay in your memory long after the film has ended. You'd be a hard heart not to enjoy this one
B00000K3CM|4.0|The movie industry has welcomed both good and poor sequels to movies,and when it comes down to good movie sequels,one of the best movie sequels (especially for a Christmas movie)happens to be,by far,the follow-up to the first \\"Home Alone\\" film:\\"Home Alone 2:Lost in New York\\". While this film may not be as good as the first \\"Home Alone\\",its smart story and script make it one of the few worthy Christmas movie sequels out there,and a good film on its own. <br /> <br />Here,Macaulay Culkin reprises his role as Kevin McCallister. And,this time around,while Kevin still may not be the most popular member of his large family,things are better for him. This is due to his family making an effort to be nicer to Kevin,something that they were motivated to do with the crisis that they faced in the first \\"Home Alone\\" film,along with the whole family flying down to Florida for Christmas (in this film). <br /> <br />However,this one accomplishment by the McCallister family for Kevin is suddenly ruined the morning the McCallister family goes to the airport to fly to Florida. While Kevin is with them,a large misunderstanding by Kevin results in Kevin boarding a plane to New York City,while the rest of his family get on the right flight to Florida. <br /> <br />Then,when Kevin realizes he is in New York City,despite the fact that his parents,Peter McCallister (John Heard)and Kate McCallister (Catherine O'Hara)find themselves once more frantically searching for Kevin with the aid of the rest of the family,Kevin decides to take advantage of being alone once more--and even manages to check into NYC's Plaza Hotel,giving himself an even better vacation than he would get if he did get on the right plane to Florida. <br /> <br />But,Kevin's perfect vacation goes from good to worse,with the hotel concierge,Mr. Hector (Tim Curry,who is hillarious in his part)discovers that not only is the credit card Kevin used to check into the hotel not Kevin's credit card,but when Kevin is spotted by the two bumbling and unintelligent burglars whom he faced off in the first \\"Home Alone\\" film,Harry (Joe Pesci)and Marv (Daniel Stern). Kevin is able to escape from both Harry and Marv and has the opportunity to remain safe--but upon discovering a plan that Harry and Marv have to rob a large NYC toy store, Duncan's Toy Chest,Kevin pulls back into action with more surprises and booby traps for Harry and Marv--which leads into more humor and surprises,into this movie's very end. <br /> <br />The major thing to question about \\"Home Alone 2:Lost in New York\\" (besides its so-called violence,which is childish,but good,black humor that works well for this movie,and is nothing to worry about with children)is the script. While the script for this film is a well-written script that accompanies a well-written story for this film,it sort of \\"borrows\\" from the first \\"Home Alone\\" film. In a way,\\"Home Alone 2:Lost in New York\\" is sort of the first \\"Home Alone\\" revised,with a lot of events in this film that are similiar to several of the events in the first \\"Home Alone\\" film occuring here. However,despite all of that,this film is still funny in its own way with not only great acting and humor (especially from Tim Curry and Rob Schneider),but good,essential family values and lessons at the same time,as well. Overall,while you will want to watch the first \\"Home Alone\\" film before you watch this film,this is a good movie sequel and one of the best Christmas films that has ever been made. It should not be missed out on by fans of both comedy and Christmas films. <br /> <br />4/5
B00008LOS1|5.0|Real Who fans already own \\"who's next\\". What many people don't realize is that \\"who's next\\" should have been a double album called Lifehouse. Lifehouse is the missing grail of rock music because it would have been without a doubt the greatest rock album ever recorded and released had the Who bothered to release it. Those who want to know why it was not released will have to read a good biography of the Who, probably the Dave Marsh bio. This isn't Lifehouse, but it does have the long, complete version of \\"Baby, don't you do it\\" , and is worth buying for cd 2, The who live at the young vic, in which they perform mostly songs considered for lifehouse. the performance is ragged, a little sloppy, like they needed more rehearsal, but still glorious and thus necessary for real Who fans, so real fans, Buy it!
B000000I0G|4.0|This is a great collection to listen to while you are working.  There is more than enough \\"Oldfield\\" here to keep your ears engaged and enough flow to keep a story going.  But I have to say, I probably like the first track the best \\"Taurus II\\"... Wait... \\"Five Miles Out\\" is the last track and I might like that the best (also) (grin).

B0000714B5|5.0|This is a great movie based on the story of Hermann Hesse about Siddharta who is determined to experience enlightenment without following any doctrines or teachers. His friend on the other habd falls in love with the Buddha and decides to follow him and become a swami. A story well told and many great aha moments. Well worth watching. A great movie to watch on a rainy sunday.
B000G8NY4U|5.0|This DVD is even better than the DVD i already bought of YANNI; Live at the Acropolis. All the musicians come for from a different country. Especially the man on flutes (coming from Armenië) is very good. You can see on the DVD the enthousiasme the musicians unclusing Yanni have making this music. There is not even one number i do not like. As i said before a TOP DVD.
B000IOM0YM|4.0|Let me start off this review by saying that ever since I was in the fourth grade,I have been one of the most hardcore KISS fans on this planet. And,despite all of the sad and pathetic problems that have continued to plague KISS over the course of their career,it is great to see the release of KISS' new and most recent DVD:\\"KISS-KISSOLOGY-The Ultimate KISS Collection-Vol. 1-1974-1977\\"--something that does the job at giving justice to and proving the talent and essence of the KISS name. <br /> <br />This set has a total of two discs in it--representing the entire 70's era of KISS--from the beginning of their career in the spotlight in 1974,to their last real success in the 70's with the \\"Love Gun\\" tour. Not only is it nice for this set to have a live performance of a known,never officially released KISS track for the Simmons/Frehley penned \\"Acrobat\\",and the music videos for \\"Hard Luck Woman\\" and \\"Love 'Em and Leave 'Em\\" (especially since most KISS home video releases from the late 80's and early 90's have 80's era KISS videos instead of 70's era KISS videos),this set also contains a total of four KISS concerts (San Fransisco's Winterland from January '75,Detroit's Cobo Hall from January '76,Tokyo's Budokan Hall from April '77,and,last but not least,Houston's The Summit from September '77). While none of these concerts stand out,they are still good concerts and well chosen offers for KISS fans. Not only is the setlist for each of the four concerts excellent and allow KISS fans who purchase/purchased this set to see various KISS classics (\\"Shout It Out Loud\\",\\"Rock and Roll All Nite\\",\\"Beth\\",etc.)performed live with lesser known KISS songs(\\"Take Me\\",\\"Nothin' To Lose\\",etc.),it makes this DVD as complete and interesting as every anthology DVD for a band needs to be. The performances show the energy that the original KISS has as a live band and allows KISS fans to witness/re-live what a 70's era KISS concert was like,with the special techniques that KISS uses in all of theirshows ***AND*** the shows that are here (I'd give it away--but the shows are better to see on this DVD if the details of them are not given away),proving that KISS DO deserve all of the hype,attention,and popularity that they have achieved over all of these years. <br /> <br />The clips from the various television shows that KISS were on in the 70's (ABC's In Concert,The Mike Douglas Show,The Midnight Special,The Paul Lynde Halloween Special,and Don Kirshner's Rock Concert)are a nice touch to this set,and allow KISS fans to learn more about KISS with this DVD set by showing the interviews that were conducted for/with KISS on these television shows (wait until you see the Gene Simmons interview on the Mike Douglas show--both cool and hillarious,as well as nostalgic!). It is a good way in letting all KISS fans (both old and new--even if you already know all about the band)know more about the history of KISS. Also,the booklet that is accompanying this set is very informative and entertaining,and feautures not only a great letter about this set and printed autograph from Paul Stanley,but also great 70's era KISS photos and background information from Gene Simmons,Paul Stanley,Ace Frehley,and Peter Criss (let me also add that it is nice to see that both Gene and Paul WERE considerate enough to let both Ace and Peter take part in this set),and will do a good job at satisfying all hardcore fans of KISS,especially with all of the beautiful photos of KISS that have been taken over the years--both previously released and previously unreleased. <br /> <br />The only major dissapointments here are the whole issue with the so-called \\"bonus discs\\" (buying this off of Amazon or anywhere else besides Best Buy and Wal-Mart brings you the Madison Square Garden '77 show,buying this from only Best Buy brings you the Cobo Hall '76 show,and buying this at Wal-Mart brings you the Largo '77 show). While a good idea,it is pretty obvious that these bonus discs were thrown in here for Gene and Paul to make a few extra dollars. With the MSG '77 show including a very small setlist and a fuzzy screen and a Cobo Hall KISS show being included as one of the KISS concerts on disc one of this DVD,I recommend buying this wherever you can get it without the worry for a bonus disc--it is a decision you WON'T regret. Also,WHAT were Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley thinking to NOT include the live version of \\"Beth\\" that Peter Criss sang on the Paul Lynde show? That performance is what set KISS' career for the 70's,and this set missing that performance not only misses out on this set being a five star set,but also lessens the set by making the set another product of the \\"Gene/Paul vs. Ace/Peter\\" show/contest,which Gene and Paul have won every time. <br /> <br />Overall,despite its faults,a nice set with lots of great KISS footage (good selections of footage also). It is nice to see more footage of the original KISS being released,and hopefully,the next two volumes of this set will be just as good and improve this set in the weak areas of this set.
B000GPIPD8|5.0|This is an interesting new album by the Black Keys. Their first two were comparatively similar, good old fashioned hard rocking blues. Then Rubber Factory came in with some darker tones, some experiments and quirky melody's which were great none the less. But on this one, its back to the blues so to speak and the lead on some tracks is just amazing, you can really hear how Dan's guitar work is evolving. its still based in blues rock, but its a bit spacier, more psychedelic and carefully played. For example, he controls feedback better and more often on this album then any of the other three. Also, he's not afraid anymore to slip in an extended solo even if the tempo drops a little into a darker place in the blues, somewhere many guitarists don't often venture. And all the songs are good. I was especially impressed with the vocals and guitar lines on Your the One; a sound I have really never heard before. If your into the Black Keys or blues in any form, you'll love this album. If your looking for a little more hard edged blues then the spacey relaxed sound that dominates most of this record, id suggest their album Thickfreakness, it definitely rocks the hardest out of all their material.
B000BJS4SU|5.0|If you like John Mayer and/or the Blues, you should have this CD.  Different from his other stuff, and very good.
B000JJRIP2|1.0|PEARL JAM, a band that I love, plays a different setlist every night, and 48 hours later the show, great, unedited and pure, is available for download for $9.99.    KISS, the band of my life, plays pretty much the same show over and over, and 7 years later (\\"Alive Millenium\\") the edited show is available...but you have to buy a box containing albums that, as a fan & collector, you have ten times each...And the cd (\\"Alive IV\\") is not even that good!    See the difference? I rest my case    PS: Of course, in terms of music quality, the box deserves more than just one star, but the whole gimmick of having to buy an entire box for one single cd is a rip-off.    Signed: A KISS collector for 25 years

B0002ADY0Q|5.0|classic rockers and younger listeners should enjoy this second effort from the under-rated unapprecitaed uriah heep. i actually bought this to replace my vinyl copy and wasn't dissapointed. memorable songs that stand up to time. \\"high priestess\\", \\"lady in black\\", simon the bullet freak\\". a very strong recording that utilized early stereo effects and over-dubbing. (remember it was 1971.) over-the-top vocal arrangements makes it work. title track is a simply \\"brilliant\\"! totally wicked! ahead of their time. buy the expanded version. queen and the darkeness owe a lot to these guys.
B0001KL5DA|4.0|This is a great series with an unusual story line.  I like the characters and the development of the story lines - something new each time.  The show is not afraid to really address issues that most shows will try to skirt around - like homosexuality and dealing with sexual issues for people of all ages.
0743289412|5.0|I have never read a Stephen King novel before. I'm not a fan of horror books or movies as a general rule. I've read all of his essays in Entertainment Weekly, and have read a few short stories. A few months ago, he mentioned somewhere (probably in EW) that Lisey's Story was unlike any book he had ever written before, so I decided to be brave and take the plunge. I've never been so glad that I did!    This book is fabulous! I couldn't stop reading it, and as someone who works in a Public Library, I've read a couple of books or two (or thousands).    It's beautifully crafted, all questions that might seem confusing as you're first starting it are answered, but most of all it's a well told story of a marriage and what goes on this particular one.    People say that no one really knows what goes on in someone else's marriage, and I, personally, believe that's true. Lisey's Story opens up a marriage and reveals it's inner workings, even though one of the characters has been dead for 2 years.    I was spellbound as I read this book. One of the other Amazon reviewers of this book claims that it's not a good book to get started on Stephen King's novels, and I whole heartedly disagree. Now that I've read it, I have more of his novels waiting to be read after the short stint of fluff reading I felt I needed to do post Lisey's Story (the book is that intense).    Don't hesitate to read this if you've never read King before. Sure, it does contain some elements that are bothersome and dare I say, freaky, but they're things that are easy to leave behind when you put the book down, although you might be tempted to say \\"Bool\\" at odd moments...    Buy this book! You won't regret it!
B000HEWEE4|5.0|as everyone may have known, the movie itself is a remake of a korean love/fantasy movie. both ones have their emphasis on the story. i like both. the lake house americanized the whole story, gave it the hollywood template, broadened the whole story, while the korean one, dealing with human emotion (mainly, love) that's so pure, it made me feel like the the couple is the whole world. anyway, it's so good to see these two of my favorite actors came back together after all these years!!!
0446677450|5.0|This book was recommended to our family for our son who had recently received his master's degree. He could not say enough good things about the book. He learned invaluable lessons from reading it.
B00006RAKP|5.0|This CD of Elton John is one of the best I've ever heard. It will take you back down memory lane.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I didn't know how popular these cd's were until I tried to buy one right before the holidays for someone on my list who expressed interest.  The music is hypnotic and tranquil at the same time.  Pleasant buying experience from this company.  This cd makes a great gift.
B000003C2U|5.0|This is the 2nd Death album I bought, right after Symbolic. I was so impressed with it that I decided to make it my goal to get this, along with SOP and ITP. I'll buy Death's early albums when I think I'm ready. Anyway, while the production of Human may not be as good as Symbolic, it's still great. Chuck's lyrics, like on the aforementioned album, are deep, thoughtful, and very thought-provoking. Just listen to the lyrics of Secret Face (my favorite song on the album, by the way)! His guitar solos are as fast as ever. Paul Masvidal may not be as good as Chuck (but who is?), but he provides a solid rythm guitar and does some really cool trade-offs with Chuck on Flattening of Emotions, Cosmic Sea, and Vacant Planets. Sean Reinert is an awesome drummer, who fills Human with a lot of double bass drumming and blast beats. Unfortunately, Steve Digiorgio's bass is buried in the background, with the exception of a good, if short, solo on Cosmic Sea. From what I hear, this guy is a really good bassist, so it's a real shame you can't hear him. Being a bassist myself, it's a big dissapointment. But other than those complaints, this is a great album.<br /><br />The title of this album is quite apt. That's because it's about the lives of every-day people. Just listen to Together As One - I think it's about marriage, and how it can be a nightmare or it can be something good: \\"Together - they will live and they will die. A living hell has just begun.\\" Suicide Machine is about how people want to die when at their own convenience, and don't accept it as in inevitability. Secret Face is about how people will fake who they really are to fit in or get what they want. That's why it's my favorite song on Human. The lyrics really represent all of the preppy teenagers at schools and how they wear certain clothes and listen to certain kinds of music just to seem \\"k3w1\\". Flattening of Emotions is about how your success or happiness can go completely downhill and you end up a failure just in the blink of an eye, and that you should always be prepared for the unexpected. Lack of Comprehension is about when people blame their problems on other people who had no part in making them miserable. It starts off very slow and atmospheric, but then rips your face off with heavy instrumentals and Chuck's thrashing voice. The guitar solo has a very stange, almost ambient, sound to it (if that fails to make sense, forgive me). But then again, all of Chuck's solos on this album sound like that. See Through Dreams is about how people always take things for granted and never think about their possessions just dissappearing, a subject that would later be continued on the song Symbolic. Cosmic Sea, an instrumental, starts off with some very strange keyboard effects, with the guitars kicking in. Then Chuck reminds us who's boss with another great solo. This is also the song were Steve's bass is the most audible. This is probable the slowest and most melodic song on Human. I especially like the spacy keyboard effects around the 2:10 mark. After that, if you have yet to hear any of Steve's other work (like me), than the solo on it shows how talented he is. Then Paul has his shining moment on the album, with a great guitar solo. As the song fades out, you here those weird keyboard effects mixing with Paul's solo. Vacant Planets is about the possibility of other life existing beyond Earth, but we refuse to believe it and think that Earth is the only planet in our infinite universe that can sustain life.<br /><br />All 'n all I'd say this is yet another masterpiece that transcends death metal, and anyone who dares to label it that obviously hasn't listened to the album. I'd still say it's metal, no doubt, but it's way more than death metal. And while I'm still new to metal, this is without a doubt in my mind one of the best metal albums of all time, along with Symbolic, and ITP and SOP I'm sure. So buy it if you're a longtime fan or a newbie to Death, or metal in general (likeme)me)
B0006Z2LP6|5.0|As a guy who grew up in the 50s and 60s, I watched every launch from Alan Shepard's first up and down flight on.  I remember where I was, exactly, when I watched Neil Armstrong take his first step onto the lunar surface, and I remember the media covering Lovell and crew as they attempted to come home safely.  Ron Howard has captured the feel of the space program in those days; this movie still gives me goosebumps in spots whenever I watch it, and I rate it in my top ten movies of all time.  Accompanied by a wonderfully stirring musical score, I believe this is director Ron Howard's finest effort to date.<br /><br />For those of you who lived through this era:  you'll love this movie, and it will be a part of your collection.  For those too young, and who are only familiar with the current \\"space program\\" which involves nothing like the American spirit evidenced back then regarding exploration, but is simply a big delivery truck taking things back and forth to an aging space station, this movie may well astonish you.<br /><br />Apollo 13 is one of those movies that must be seen, and I recommend it highly.
B000268QB2|5.0|the first song is absolutely amazing!!! it really reminded me of that someone.
0618680004|5.0|A few points: <br /> <br />* This is an extremely important book by a brilliant scientist with something valuable to contribute to the quest for knowledge, understanding, and reason. <br />* Dawkins' argument isn't that God certainly does not exist, but he does make a compelling argument that it is very highly improbable that a supreme being exists. <br />* He also makes a strong argument against the faith based world-view (and its trappings like intelligent design \\"theory\\"), versus a world-view based on scientific obsevation, measurement, and reason. <br /> <br />There is so much more that is worthy of consideration. Get this book and read it!
0743537009|5.0|For a good movie --  watch The Shining with Jack Nicholson. But.....for a better twist on the tale, READ THE BOOK! It is so much better.
B000H305U0|5.0|This album is excellent. Although there are 2 songs that make the album a little boring and they could easily not be included cause they don't even fit in there. Despite that fact the album includes almost 5 to 6 songs with the new sound of Timbaland's productions and some very good mid tempo rnb beats.
B000IY06CK|1.0|If you are at all familiar with Tchaikovsky's violin concerto, you'll be as disconcerted as I was with this version.  At first, it seems an excellent thing that the violinist is in the forefront.  But soon into the recording you may be wondering, as I did, just what you were listening to.  The violinist's performance lacks continuity, as well as passion and frankly, personality.  I cannot say if this is due to interpretation or skill level.  Nor do the orchestra and violinist seem to be in synch -- I rather feel like the two rehearsed and recorded separately and then were merged into this CD.  I found it disappointing, as I also found the frequent odd noises on the disk, including instrument sounds, fizzing, fuzziness and noises as made with a live audience.  Sorry, Julia -- I loved your Vivaldi four seasons, but the Tchaikovsky is done better by Bell, Vengerov, Sitkovetsky, or just about anyone else.
0143034901|5.0|I bought this book for our book club (and also on the recommendation of my sister who loved it).  The book has multiple stories running at different times in Spanish history, and more than one person I know has had to make a list of characters as it can get rather confusing.  That being said.....The writing is wonderfully descriptive, and the characters are deep and complicated.  It is a love story and a mystery and a piece of history all wrapped in one package.  This was one of the rare books that I forced myself to read slowly as to savor every word and image.  I have already lent out my copy to a friend.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|Dylan never misses to amaze me. I was not a total fan in my younger years, as I grew up in a small town in Germany and some of the music I just didn't quite get. Living in the USA since 1975, it is clear how important an artist this man is. This new record shows really just what he always did: re-invent himself once more using music history, some his own, some others and shapes it into a completely enjoyable innovative record. <br />Robert Brueckner
B00003CXBK|5.0|Good movie, with a fascinating story line, it has kept my nephew enthralled for many years, and remains one of his favorite movies.
0743289412|1.0|I just did not get the whole story line.  It took forever for the point of the story to come out and when it did, it just didn't grab me.  I skimmed over large portions just to get done with the book.
B000F1IQN2|3.0|I rented this and PARADISE NOW at the same time.  I was surprised to find that the very modestly budgeted PARADISE NOW totally trumped Spielberg's movie.  I was a child during the Munich atrocity and was intrigued by Spielberg's effective portrayal of the event.  That was 5 stars worth of film-making.  Too bad he botched up the rest so badly.  The actors did a great job with a very naive and sappy script.  I don't think Spielberg could've fit another second of mournful Jewish violin music in.  Let me say straight out that I am not Jewish and have much sympathy for the Palestinians.  However, I am also a staunch believer in the pursuit of truth in all things.  And I was AMAZED that Spielberg did a backward limbo for the Palestinian TERRORIST cause so extreme he had to almost be a contortionist.  Bad people on both sides of the conflict take advantage of the chaos for their own benefit.  The fact that these people don't seem to honestly see peace as a goal is much of the great tragedy of the conflict IMHO.  Good people, both Israelis and Palestinians, are trapped in the vice in between.  Spielberg portrayed every Palestinian victim as either a possibly mistaken target, a very sweet friendly fellow who had no choice but to POSSIBLY be a terrorist or a young tortured Palestinian idealist who probably could quote Nietzsche and be a great buddy.  If I were an Israeli, I would never let Spielberg enter the country again!  Even I find his message in the film to be pro-terrorist, i.e. the Israelis kind of deserved what they got (and deserve what they get today).  There is an element of truth in that Israeli actions spurred retaliations but saying that the guys who come to the fore to murder innocent civilians in the name of the cause are all a bunch of superior intellectuals is a bunch of crap.  I was disgusted by the end of this movie and started fast-forwarding more and more as it went along!  If I were Israeli or a Jewish Zionist, I think my head would have exploded off my neck.  And if I were Palestinian I would have been happy to find out Mossad was full of part-time, inexperienced, non-expert idiots with no international network to speak of.  Spielberg may be good as a director but he should stick to fantasy films.  I'm starting to think SAVING PRIVATE RYAN was a fluke or he has a great staff who covered for him.  As for SCHINDLER'S LIST, research about that fellow has shown me this was another one of Spielberg's flights of fantasy as far as truth. If you want to see a GREAT film about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict with a fantastic script and exceptional acting, watch PARADISE NOW.
B0000C1733|5.0|a great album, all of there best songs to rock out to. the only song i think that there misssing is the zephyr song, but othere than that this cd rocks!
B000FQ4M58|5.0|These are my favorite brand of jean & it is doubly <br />nice to get them at such a good price, delivered quickly  <br />& finding they fit perfectly. Thank you, as always.
B00005JPAJ|5.0|A gun on a wall to shoot-this slogan is the most relevant and to the point quintessence of a hyperbolized set of events linking people of four distant countries with common for all human beings features: thirst for sex, egoism, stupidity and a callous ignorance to others' problems.<br /><br />It is a very sad story leaving,perhaps, some room for a happy end in the future.
0767821629|5.0|In the vein of The Matrix, revealing what's real and what's not is a great plot device. The Thirteenth Floor was a refreshing movie that really gets you thinking about one's perspective. This one's a keeper!

B000063DFS|5.0|This album is one of Ozzy's best. It is the one that got me to listen to Ozzy in the first place. It has made me a die-hard Ozzy fan.
B000FQJAIW|4.0|I really loved this disc.  I hated the SPED versions of the original trilogy and I only bought this for the original cut which is now just a bonus feature.  The transfer was very squashed and not put into true letterbox format however I will take anything I can to replace my poor, abused VHS versions!  The SPED version was no different, or at least marginally different, than the set that came out before.  Overall, you are paying for the bonus features which, if you hate the CGI add-ins like me, is a great investment.
B000I5X80G|4.0|This CD brought back fond memories. I had the pleasure of meeting Niel when he played with The Who at Cincinnati's Music Hall. That was by far my favorite show of his live. I'm 58 years old now but, never grow tired of hearing Niel's unique voice. Been a fan since his days with Buffalo Springfield. Glad to add this CD to my Vinyl Collection of his works.
B000HCO8IQ|1.0|The best I can say about this music cd is the first song \\"I don't feel like dancing\\" is a great dance song no doubt about it. But one good song does not a cd make...and the song does get boring over and over again. The remaining songs are either just plain bad, strange or both. I listened to it numerous times hoping it would grow on me but sadly it has not. \\"She's my man\\" is passable but only because of the beat really, otherwise it falls short as do all the other songs. It goes from dance to rock to country sounding and somewhere between all of them at once. I know others like or even love it however I gave it a big chance and was sadly disappointed...
B0006A9FKA|5.0|I love this comedy.  I've watched it at least twelve times and it still cracks me up. Very original.  If you haven't seen it, watch it!
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Whether you're on the right or the left, there's much to be found in this DVD.  The science seems quite indisputable.  He should have left out the (very) few politic bits, the DVD would've been even more compelling to those on the right without that.
B00005JL1C|3.0|I love this movie.  Pure 80's romantic comedy! Eric Stoltz is blind to see the love right in front of his face, while chasing for the love of the high school beauty (Lea Thompson).  A great movie to watch, if you want to revisit your dramatic high school crushes.
B00005QW5X|5.0|This is another film I orginally saw on IFC.  It is so original, I had to buy it.  It is emotionally moving and powerful.  The inch is a subject I certainly have never seen portrayed in film before.  This is not for the homophobe.  I fell in love with Hedwig, and I'm female.
032147404X|5.0|As Scott Kelby himself says on the back cover of this book, his approach is to share how-to tips as if you were out with him on a photo shoot.  The approach is very accessible and easy to follow.  I've read a few other books that were very helpful in terms of creating a good composition, getting a \\"creative\\" exposure, but Scott's book really helped me with some nagging questions I've had.  For example, I got into digital photography so that I could photograph my kids' sporting events to take better portraits.  I've always wondered how to get better sports pictures in low light and his section on shooting sports gave me the answers I needed and identified a \\"sweet spot\\" shutter speed and optimal ISO settings.  Also, in a section on \\"Avoiding Problems like the Pros\\" he provides important tips such as the fact that batteries have shorter lives in cool weather, or how to change your lens and avoid dust, or other reasons the pros use lens hoods.      I've been very curious about the use of RAW format, but didn't know the first thing about what is possible in terms of post-shot processing with RAW vs. JPEG formats.  I've been shooting in JPEG-Fine for quite some time, and I've been running into some problems with my shots related to over/under exposure with limited options for fixing the problem with my current software.  Scott talks quite a bit about what you can do in Photoshop and I found it very intriguing.  He didn't get into the how-to details surrounding Photoshop in this book, but he did get me interested in it by showing some great effects created in Photoshop.  In fact, I've decided to buy Photoshop Elements 5.0 (better for a newbie like me...) and his step by step book on the product (The Photoshop Elements 5 Book for Digital Photographers - Scott Kelby) because his book appears to have the same no nonsense, tell it to me straight, type of approach that I liked so much in this book - at least that's what the reviewers are saying...      Scott also has a great section at the back of the book entitled \\"Photo Recipes to Help You Get 'The Shot'\\" where he'll show a particular type of photo effect, such as single subject shot of a flower, portrait with soft directional light and natural skin tones, or smooth and silky water and dramatic skies in a landscape shot, and tell you step by step what you need to do to replicate the exact shot demonstrating the affect on that page.  It's really great and it's given me some ideas on things I'd like to try.  For example, I want to try playing with slower shutter speeds for more dramatic movement shots necessary to capture people dancing, or a band playing a concert.  He shows how to do this in the book.      Scott also has a great sense of humor.  I won't spoil any of his jokes, but in addition to giving you some great advice on photography, the book is an enjoyable read.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|Every song is good on this cd. Play it all the time while driving. Looking forward to the next cd by John Mayer.
B000001FDK|5.0|I listened to this record as a child every single day for years growing up (late 70's/early 80's). It was my first introduction to original Rock'n'Roll. I knew about Sha-Na-Na before I knew about Elvis or Chuck Berry (similar to my experience of seeing Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band the movie and thinking the Bee Gees came up with those songs!). I was also convinced that people in the 50's and 60's broke out into song constantly. This is worth those memories.
B00005JLKN|3.0|While it lasted this seemed quite respectably sick and nasty, but after it finished I thought: Hmm. Then I read the seriously critical reviews, and they began to explain why this show didn't satisfy. There was something empty about it, although I had a sort of advantage, in that I'd seen Silence, but not Manhunter. With this fine cast I thought I couldn't go wrong, but it became obvious that it was mostly just a cash-cow, milking the crowd-pulling Hannibal. Actually, I didn't think Silence was all that marvellous, either. The idea is that one homicidal loony can understand the mentality of another homicidal loony; but that's the only real idea, and after that it's just play it again, Sam. Oh, I suppose underlying this is that we're all loonies, since we can understand the other loonies. Then we can thrill to the sight of the handicapped, hare-lipped and blind, and the thought that happy, healthy, normal, nuclear families are getting massacred. It's all fairly sick, really. Richard III is better.
B000001ED2|5.0|Where did this all come from. This CD came out 11 years ago, and still when I start listening to this disk I can't stop. Every single song on the record is wonderful. It would be hard for me to pick favorites because each song is just so well done and so memorable. In my opinion this CD is a classic in it's entirity.
B000G8NY4U|5.0|There's no way to tell in words how this concert was. The first time I saw this concert I was speechless and I could not believe it. Just the best musicians in the world. Highly recommended this!!!!
0618680004|2.0|It's very rare that I do not actually finish a book I start but with this I only managed about three quarters the way through. I don't think I missed much though, in fact I think that after the first 25 pages you pretty much have the information contained, the remainder is just repeating the same themes with a slightly different analogy. Another annoying characteristic is the constant, immature name calling issued against anyone with alternative beliefs. <br />Overall a dissapointment
B00005JOCU|4.0|Two things came to mind immediately after viewing \\"Dreamgirls\\", the new film based on the Broadway play starring Jamie Foxx, Beyonce' Knowles, Eddie Murphy and Jennifer Hudson.<br /><br />1. This is a good film getting too much hype.<br /><br />2. Eddie Murphy deserves an Academy Award nomination.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. \\"Dreamgirls\\" is a good film. It moves fast, entertains, is filled with good music and a couple of good performances. But it is not a great film. Because of all of the hype, people will go to see this film expecting to be blown away. When what they actually experience is only a `good' film, they will feel let down. If people went in with lower expectations, they would probably enjoy the film more.<br /><br />Eddie Murphy plays James \\"Thunder\\" Early, a `James Brown'-esque singer. Now, you may think, as I did \\"Wow, he's just going to use the impersonation he did so well during his years on `Saturday Night Live'.\\" But the role is so much more than that and Murphy is able to show the true range of his acting ability.<br /><br />In case you have been living in a cave: \\"Dreamgirls\\" is a fictionalized look at the early career of Diana Ross and the Supremes. The Dreamettes, a local girl group from Detroit, enters a talent contest and catches the eye of Curtis (Jamie Foxx), a used car salesman desperate to become a music producer. He watches the group led by Effie (Jennifer Hudson), backed by Deena (Beyonce Knowles) and Lorrell (Anika Noni Rose), sing up a storm and bring the crowd to their feet. Some quick negotiations with Early's manager (Danny Glover) lead to a gig singing backup for the famous musician. Now, Curtis needs to introduce himself to the Dreamettes. After helping Early become a bigger, breakout star, Curtis decides to let the Dreams tour on their own. But he wants Deena to front the group, shocking everyone including Effie, Curtis' girlfriend. Everyone agrees, for the good of the group. As the Dreams become more famous, Effie becomes more resentful and eventually parts ways with the group. Curtis has no trouble finding a replacement and the group soon becomes `Deena and the Dreams'. Curtis has even bigger dreams; a record label, movies, television. And he will do anything to get there. Deena begins to notice some of these bad things and starts to look for a way out.<br /><br />Written and directed by Bill Condon (\\"Gods and Monsters\\", \\"Kinsey\\") and adapted from the play by Michael Bennett, \\"Dreamgirls\\" is an old-fashioned Hollywood musical. It is nice to see this and see a good example of the genre. But this film would never have happened without the success of \\"Moulin Rouge\\" and \\"Chicago\\".<br /><br />Condon, who helped adopt \\"Chicago\\" for the big screen, has done a good job of integrating musical numbers into the story. This is the type of musical where the characters spontaneously burst into song, which become extensions of the character's dialogue, making the transition virtually seamless. I have never seen the play, but I was surprised by the lack of choreographed dancers. There are only two points when songs are accompanied by old fashioned production numbers including choreographed dancers, and these are fun to watch. But the majority of the songs are performed by one person or a small group.<br /><br />I was also surprised by how much of the story of the Supremes is \\"borrowed\\" for the film. From what I know, they follow the story pretty faithfully, changing names and places, until the end. The ending is significantly changed and I am not sure why as it robs the film of a lot of dramatic potential.<br /><br />Condon does a great job of bringing together all of the production elements to successfully evoke the periods of the film. As the Dreams rise through the ranks, they play the fancy nightclubs of the 50s up through the discos of the 70s. As their fortunes rise, the d&eacute;cor of their personal surroundings becomes more and more elaborate and help evoke the taste of the era.<br /><br />Jamie Foxx plays Curtis, the Berry Gordy-like Svengali who attaches himself to Deena and the Dreams and strives to help them achieve fame. Foxx's performance is one note and lackluster. The character's obsession is aided by this same one note nature, showing another example of his drive, but Foxx delivers practically every line in the same voice, showing little, if any emotion. A couple of times Curtis is seen staring at Deena and Effie, looking through them, in an effort to show his feelings towards them. Even towards the end, when things start to crumble, he shows little emotion.<br /><br />Beyonce Knowles can sing, but she is a weak actress. She is better suited to small roles in films like \\"Austin Powers\\" and \\"The Pink Panther\\", films that allow her to speak as little dialogue as possible and use her required music video to provide promotion on MTV. She simply isn't a good enough actress to make Deena a real person. It also doesn't help that Deena is made such an understanding and nice person. She supports Effie and doesn't want to lead the group, she has to be persuaded. Because the film makes her so saintly, she never has an opportunity to show any dramatic force.<br /><br />Eddie Murphy's performance as James \\"Thunder\\" Early is the best and most interesting in the film. As a well-known singer, he is also a well-known womanizer and agrees to let the Dreams do backup because he is interested in Lorrell (Leal), the youngest member of the group. Murphy brilliantly brings this character trait to life. As soon as they hit the road, he begins the seduction and quickly realizes it will take a little longer than planned. Over the course of the film, Early changes, grows and regresses along with the rest of the industry. Murphy makes all of these character changes, good and bad, believable and real.<br /><br />This is something I never thought I would say but Eddie Murphy deserves an Academy Award nomination for the role.<br /><br />Jennifer Hudson plays Effie, the discarded member of the group, the fourth Dream. Her character is the best singer and her story is the most dramatic, so she naturally comes across as more interesting than Deena. Hudson does a very good job of showing Effie's talent, struggles and triumphs. Her show stopper number \\"I Will Tell You I Am Not Going\\" is also the most powerful and memorable song in the film. Because her performance is so good, it makes Beyonce's performance seem all the more weak. If you are a well-known performer and play the weaker member of the group, you need to be able to make the role resonate. Beyonce doesn't do that and every time Hudson appears on screen, we are reminded of that.<br /><br />Think about it. Beyonce is playing the self-acknowledged weaker singer of the group and the best song is performed by the best singer in the group. How does this help Beyonce exactly? Hudson wipes up the floor with her.<br /><br />\\"Dreamgirls\\", despite the problems, is a fun film to watch.<br /> <br />Jamie Foxx plays Curtis, the Berry Gordy-like Svengali who attaches himself to Deena and the Dreams and strives to help them achieve fame.

0446528056|2.0|As a Nicholas Sparks fan, I know that I am about to read the story of a diamond in the rough guy falling for the sweet Southern girl and how that love changed him into either a better man or a broken one.  They will eventually break up but the brought together again either to say goodbye or to reunite.  But the characters and the love story make each story unique.  There was something about the characters and how they fell in love that make me want to root for them and feel for their heartache.  Dear John did not do that for me.  Part of my problem is Savannah who I found overbearingly naive.  Jaime Sullivan from A Walk to Remember who was also sweet and naive had more personality than Savannah.  I wanted to care for John because I was interested to read how being a soldier affected him, but now I find his life as a soldier as a hinderance to his character's growth.  I was expecting him to soften his edges a little bit but he never did even when he found a way to relate to his father.  As for their love story, it was poorly developed even for a whirlwind romance.  I could not get past the fact that by the second or third day of meeting each other they were declaring their love for each other.  True Believer also had a whirlwind romance but it was more developed through more interactions between Lexie and Jeremy and the development of their characters. <br /> <br />I am giving Dear John two stars because I did not hate the story, I was simply bored with it.
0895260131|4.0|Spencer's PIG to Islam and the Crusades is a very well researched and supported text chock full of FACTS regarding the subject matter, all of which are well cited and documented.  Spencer's book could easily be misconstrued as \\"hate-speech\\" as is common for those on the left to accuse those who embrace the truth, no matter how grim it may be, but he does not advocate violence, simply awareness, both on the part of the average Westerner as well as those who practice Islam. <br /> <br />The book is separated into two (really, three) segments, the first part dealing with Islam and the second dealing with the Crusades.  In the first segment of the book, Spencer uses numerous direct quotes form the Quran taken in context, as well as quotes from the Hadith, the cardinal documents of Islam.  Spencer also lays out a foundation of knowledge of the Quran and mentions that the chapters are arranged based on length, not chronology and the two periods in which the Quran were written, the Medinan and Meccan years.  All of the background information he supplies the reader with help them understand exactly the point he is trying to make.  The second half of the book is about the Crusades.  Spencer quickly points out where the Crusades' failures as well as their victories.  Spencer basically spells it out for the reader that the Crusades failed their millitary goals, but did manage to keep the expansionism of Islam at bay for several hundred years.  Spencer does point out when there is embellishment on both sides, the Christians were not completely in the wrong, and the Muslims certainly were not in the right.  Spencer reveals and documents the true reason the Crusades were started (which is often overlooked in most PC history classes).  The book will raise some difficult questions within the reader.  <br /> <br />All the while, Spencer recommends other scholarly books on whatever the subject matter he is citing is, one of which is the Quran itself, and directs the reader on how toobtain a free copy of the Quran, translated to English. <br /> <br />If one were to read this book completely objectively, lending credit to fact and logic, even when it might contradict with the reader's opinion, it would be impossible to disagree with this book.  Unfortunately, those who point out the violent nature of Islam immediately accused of being bigots, and Spencer is no exception, although his book is completely devoid of any bigotry.

B00005JPDY|4.0|Robert DeNiro is considered by many to be one of the finest actors working in film. Naturally, after playing the number of diverse, challenging roles he has brought to the big screen, he is looking for new challenges. As someone working in film, one of those challenges is directing. Rather than play it safe, DeNiro takes on the complex tale of the birth of the CIA in \\"The Good Shepherd\\".<br /><br />April, 1961. The Bay of Pigs is a disaster and Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) returns to Washington, DC as President Kennedy prepares to do some damage control and avert World War III. As he contemplates how the leak may have occurred, he begins to think back to his college days at Yale. Recruited into the secret Skull & Bones society, Edward soon becomes a full fledged member, trying to remain loyal to his fraternity brothers. At one of the society's retreats, he meets Clover (Angelina Jolie), the sister of his friend, John Russell (Gabriel Macht), the son of a Senator (Keir Dullea), who are also members of the society. Clover throws herself at Edward and a couple of weeks later, she announces she is pregnant and she and Edward are soon married. As World War II looms, Edward is approached by General Sullivan (Robert DeNiro), who wants a select group of men to travel to Europe to perform counter intelligence. After they return, Edward meets his son and the counter intelligence operations continue, becoming the basis of the Central Intelligence Agency, under the direction of Phillip Allen (William Hurt). Throughout his life, Edward faces challenges to his family life, patriotism and loyalty.<br /><br />\\"The Good Shepherd\\" is a difficult thing to discuss. At over 2 hours and 45 minutes, the film covers a lot of territory and presents a lot of detail and both director DeNiro and writer Eric Roth (\\"Munich\\", \\"Ali\\", \\"The Insider\\", \\"Forrest Gump\\") have done a great job of keeping all of this information accessible and easy to follow. You never feel as though you are drowning in story, details or characters, and there are many I didn't even mention.<br /><br />Matt Damon's performance as Edward is interesting. Extremely modulated, he almost never changes the tone of his voice. This does two things; on the one hand, it perfectly conveys his constant unease with his role in society and what he does but on the other hand, it makes his performance slightly boring. You want Damon to speak up, yell, cry, and do something other than stare impassively at someone else. I get that he is playing a spy, and is supposed to remain very aloof, but he is also playing a human. The few times he does yell or shout light up the screen and show us the potential of this character. I understand why it didn't happen more, but if it had, the character would have gone from just good to near great.<br /><br />Anjelina Jolie plays Clover, or Margaret, the precocious daughter of a US Senator (Keir Dullea). From the moment we first meet her, she throws herself at Edward in a determined effort to snare him. As the story evolves, they are soon married and Edward is off to War, leaving her to give birth to their son alone. Later in the film, she complains about being left alone, about how he never loved her, etc. Her role resembles the old fashioned `vamp' type of role. I recently saw some `Pre Code' films made by Hollywood in the early 30s. In these films, Barbara Stanwyck, Jean Harlow and the like, play `upwardly mobile' women determined to sleep their way to the top. In \\"The Good Shepherd\\", Jolie's Margaret seems determined to mate with Edward. If this is, in fact, the case, we never really learn why.<br /><br />The film is filled with a veritable who's who of memorable character actors. Michael Gambon plays one of Edward's Yale professors, who may have a thing for young men. Alec Baldwin plays Sam Murach, a member of the FBI who initially approaches Edward with an assignment. Billy Crudup plays Arch Cummings, a British spy who helps train Edward. William Hurt plays PhillipAllen, the man who helps found the CIA and guide the organization in its first few years. Timothy Hutton, Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci and John Turtorro also pop up as various pieces of the puzzle. Some of these supporting characters are more involving and more interesting than others; Gambon stands out as an integral part of the story. As a poetry professor, guiding Edward in his thesis, he makes a pass at Edward who rejects. But this professor plays an important part in the overall story and finding out how he fits in is part of the fun. Alec Baldwin pops up repeatedly as sort of a guardian angel for Edward, guiding him towards the truth. John Turturro plays Edward's assistant, working with him through the decades as they work through one crisis after another. Other characters pop up briefly and then disappear. Joe Pesci plays a gangster ousted from Cuba when Castro takes over. Edward turns to him for help and guidance before the Bay of Pigs operation. The role is interesting, but way too brief and more of a distraction than anything. Oh, look. It's Joe Pesci.<br /><br />\\"The Good Shepherd\\" works best when it concentrates on the mechanics of the story, showing us how this agency was created, some of the activities it participated in, the like. From the moment Edward enters Yale, he seems destined to follow in his father's footsteps and become a member of the super secretive \\"Skull and Bones\\" society. We watch as Edward participates in the initiation and then his first interaction with Murach (Baldwin), in 1939. Murach wants him to give him a list of people who may be Nazi sympathizers. Edward's patriotism is never at question, so he does what he needs to do. Then, General Sullivan (DeNiro), also a member of \\"Skull and Bones\\", asks him to do counter intelligence work in London during World War II. There, he works with Cummings (Crudup) and others to learn about their methods and provide any help he can. Here, he begins a long and trusting relationship with his assistant (Turturro). Upon his return home, Sullivan asks him to continue the work with the new CIA, which will be headed by another member of \\"Skull and Bones\\", Philip Allen (Hurt). The film goes to great lengths to successfully show us the wheeling - dealing that went on behind the scenes during the formation of this agency.<br /><br />Then the story shifts and we start to watch some of the operations they were involved in. These are presented as vignettes, of a sort, and they all lead to Castro and the Bay of Pigs. DeNiro and Roth use these events to illustrate the long term problems the CIA and other agencies of its type create for themselves and us. As the CIA becomes more involved in foreign governments, they sometimes make the wrong decisions, which proves troublesome to our country at later points.<br /><br />The last act of the film, which details the Bay of Pigs operation and the resulting fiasco it creates, also involves Edward and Margaret's son, Edward Junior (Eddie Redmayne Jr.), now a young man who is also a part of the CIA. Throughout the film, as Edward steps back into the lives of his wife and son, we watch the boy grow up, insecure, always looking for his father's approval. As a member of the CIA, he is no different. This part of the story was the least successful simply because I found the performance by Redmayne to be fairly one note as well. In one scene, his expression is blank. In the next, he is mad at his dad. In another, another argument. In yet another, the blank expression returns. It is also difficult to believe Damon and Jolie's characters would father a grown son as they look pretty much the same throughout. The one concession to age seems to be a little bit of powder on Jolie's face and she appears to be tired. But they don't really age so it is startling to watch this character grow up as they stay relatively the same age.<br /><br />DeNiro is clearly a talented director, and he is working with a story he has a great deal of interest in. It is also nice to see a film depict such a secretive organization `warts and all'. What the film shows doesn't appear to be sugar coated; we see the good and the bad. And that's a good thing. But as an actor, it seems like he would be able to realize the majority of the performances in the film are lifeless and cold. The most emotional characters are either the least mature, or the most harassed, as two Russian spies turn on the emotions as they plea for their life.<br /><br />\\"The Good Shepherd\\" is worth your time, and it will take a lot of it, but it will be stingy in the rewards. You will learn a lot about the operations, but little about the people behind the early days of the Central Intelligence Agency.his assistant (Turturro).

B000FUF6QS|2.0|I brought this movie because I was told that it was a great Horror Movie. Well it was totally a lie. The movie was horrible. The only good thing that I can say about this movie is the ending. It kinda save the entire rating from being a 1 star.
B000BNI90O|5.0|Great to have ALL music of the (extended(!!) version of the) film together. <br />It is so much more than just the standard CD. The enclosed DVD with the complete soundtrack in dolby surround is absolutely fantastic!! <br />I just cannot wait for the complete soundtracks of 'The Two Towers' and 'The return of the King'.
B000IU3XTM|4.0|'9' is certainly the adopted sister of the must acclaimed predecessor 'O'..you could actually tag this onto the end and it would knit perfectly. Finely crafted songs such as 'Rootless Tree', 'Coconut Skins', 'Me, My Yoke and I' and 'Sleep, Don't Weep' underline Rice as a quality singer/songwriter of true substance..It is difficult to criticise Rice but the one minor criticism that I have with this album is that with a 3year gap between both albums, I did expect some diversity. That being said, it is still being played continuously on my ipod, and each song stands on it's own which unfortunately cannot be said of many of the albums being churned out these days...
B000002ADT|5.0|I am rather new to Miles Davis' music, but I am now a great fan after hearing this CD.  It has an awesome selection of slow to fast songs, and some outstanding instrumentals.  Of course, people that know this are aware of this already, but I do recommend this for really classic jazz/blues sounds.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|I saw this when it was on PBS, It was riviting, beautiful performance. These Celtic Women programs are well worth your time.
B000059ZLH|4.0|Really liked this dvd a lot, specially watching my favorite Dream Theater album being played live. Sound quality is good, image quality is good, I already knew the plot of the album so it bothered me having to watch those alternating scenes from the movie instead of the band, but I recognize that it really complements the show for those who don't know what the album's about.<br /><br />The end of Finally Free, where Mike Portnoy almost pops his heart out... I hated not having a decent camera focusing on that.<br /><br />Anyway, completely satisfied with it.
B0000025H0|3.0|This album ranks least among many good releases for this great artist, and was the first Santana album to drop below the 500,000 sales mark necessary for gold record certification.<br /><br />The music on this CD falls, some in the Pop Rock genre and some in the Latin Rock, yet it is difficult to give it a perfect identity or description. Santana seems lost between his love for the Rock Jazz Fusion music, his worries about sales and his commercial rank among the big Rock artists.<br /><br />Bottom line \\"Marathon\\" is for the hardcore Santana fans only.<br /><br />Other great Santana releases:<br /><br />1. Santana<br /><br />2. Abraxas<br /><br />3. Santana III<br /><br />4. Love, Devotion and Surrender. (Jazz-Rock-Fusion)<br /><br />5. Caravanserai (Jazz-Rock)<br /><br />6. Carlos Santana and Buddy Miles.
B000069KE0|5.0|This CD, to me, is Chicago's best work.  It is a compilation that encompasses almost all music genres, from big band, to rock, to blues, to jazz, pop and even classical.  It has fantastic selections of songs, most of which go from one song into another in a blending way that makes you not be able to turn it off.  I have loved it since I was younger, and now am introducing my 13 year old son to it.  He plays baritone horn and the exposure to all the varieties of brass in their music is fantastic learning.  I recommend this CD to any Chicago fan, anyone who loves all different kinds of music, and anyone who appreciates orchestra and band sounds.
B000E1MXSW|5.0|If you are Catholic or just curious and ever wondered what kind of ceremony did nuns go through to become nuns, this is the movie for you. <br />It is accurate and an interesting study of missonaries and why women enter the convent.  It details their human struggles and the sacrifices they made. Audrey Hepburn was great....a vintage or cult piece.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|Man, this is one of my top five movies ever. Extremely hilarious, excellent performances from all of the characters, absolutely entertaining.
B000002534|4.0|This is a must have album for every Santana CD fan.<br />Borboletta is another studio work, showing Santana's feel to Jazz and fusion, fitting beautifully in style with the music of John McLaughlin and the Mahavishnu Orchestra.<br />It is Santana's 6th Studio recording and although this album did not spend lot of time in the 1974 Rock music chart (perfectly logical), it is surely a masterpiece for this artist.<br />This album is not a basic Santana rock album, yet a blend of Rock, Jazz and fusion.<br /><br />If you like this album, you may want to check the following previous releases:<br />1. Caravanserai.<br />2. Love, devotion and surrender.

Too bad, society is losing a lot of precious freedom because of the narrow-minded fundamentalists hoping to make the USA a theocracy.

B000GIWS7E|2.0|I don't know what made Dream Theater change the previous dvds sound editing formula, but this is really far away from the Budokan dvd. Is it only in my case or drums are totally low, I can't even distinguish what Mike is hitting. Guitar is really loud. I had high expectancy on this dvd because of the songs list and the fact that it would be orchestrated. Now I know that the Budokan dvd remains the best.

It's not 100 percent true to the stage production but there are still the same characters. Rizzo is the bad girl and leader of the Pink Ladies. Sandy is the goodie good who might just go a little bad to get the guy that she wants. Watch and see how is tall turns out.

0618551050|5.0|I have a PhD in physics and really appreciate what the author attempted to do, in this wide ranging work. The main lesson I drew from this book is parallel to the muscle bound theories of brane world physics, which exclude LQG's quantum bounce, and vice versa. Eventually a major re do of the early universe theories is in order, and likely Smollen will be the person who can do it. As a dabbler in terms of cosmology, I can only wish people of Smollens calibre good luck in what will be an exciting period of theoretical physics, once people learn enough to be able to do the necessary investigative leg work.

0790734850|1.0|I can't believe how many people think this movie is a masterpiece. I had such high expectations of it and was extremely disappointed. When the film began I was interested for about 20 minutes, but then as it went on I started to have doubts. After a while I was debating whether or not to turn it off, but towards the end I decided to leave it on just to see how bad it was actually going to get. And it really did get bad! The ending was so predictible and hackneyed. It was just another crappy cops and robbers story, but with a high budget and an all-star cast.
B00001U0GQ|4.0|The year is 1757... The principal occupants of the region are Native Americans and a great diversity of wild life...<br /><br />It is the third year of the war between French and British, for the possession of the continent, somewhere on the frontier west of the Hudson River... The Mohicans are allied with the British while their old enemies the Hurons side with the French...<br /><br />There, three men roam the forest making their living as frontier trappers and scouts... The first is Hawkeye, a superb frontiersman raised by the Mohawk, who can reload and fire a flintlock at full run; the second is his adopted father Chingachgook, the last of the Mohicans, and the third, his brother Uncas, 'a warrior swift and straight as an arrow shot in the sun.'<br /><br />This trio seems have nothing to do with the early Colonial wars, until they come upon the vengeful Magwa and his Huron war party as they attempt to slaughter the Munro sisters, Cora and Alice, heading with a small regiment of redcoats to meet up with their father, Colonel Munro, at Fort William Henry...<br /><br />Eventually, the compassionate Mohican family comes to the rescue with a spectacular style of fighting... The film takes full advantage of their graphic capabilities with incredibly fast and fluid fighting action and mind-blowing attack moves... Shortly thereafter, two love stories take place...<br /><br />The three men lead the survivors to the English fort besieged by French forces and their Huron allies... The siege is a grand affair of roaring nighttime cannon and mortar attacks...<br /><br />Michael Mann's historical romance film gives a realistic picture of the frontier life, and a vivid impression of the horrors of warfare in the wilderness at the time where the combatants often had time for one shot before being overpowered and reduced to hand-to-hand fierce combat... The movie is filled with scenes of incredible, brutal violence... It's warfare at a primal level...<br /><br />Academy Award Winner Daniel Day Lewis also known as \\"The long rifle\\" is splendid as Hawkeye, the legendary warrior who encourages the Colonial militia to desert... He agrees to surrender in exchange for the life of two sisters and one British officer... He vows romantically to Cora that he will find her no matter how long it takes, no matter how far...<br /><br />Madeleine Stowe manages to find in Cora's fiery character a balance between sensitivity and strength... War and tragedy swirl around her as she struggles to protect her man... Cora's attraction grows for the soft-spoken warrior, who shows marked differences when compared to Major Heyward...<br /><br />Jodhi May is the blonde Alice, Cora's younger timid sister... By that long shot of her innocent face - a portrait of extreme torment and despair - we are all aware of her sufferings... We sense more pain than she can cope with... May has almost no lines, but her eyes, brimming with tears, are saying everything... No matter how much she wants to remain standing, she was retreating further and further from the ugly face of Magua... Her heart was crying out in anger... We all know that she will do anything than surrender... Her breakdown turns the scene into a willpower for revenge..<br /><br />Russell Means is powerful as the Mohican elder Chingachgook... His running battle along that majestic ridge is some of the finest film-making we've seen in terms of action and intensity... There is no dialog in these moments but the scene leaves us certainly breathless..<br /><br />Wes Studi is Magua, the infamous Huron Indian who always speaks of himself in the third person... He is fluent in English, French, and Huron... Magua is a strong, vibrant villain consumed with hatred... Magua plots the massacre of the retreating troops, their women and children...<br /><br />Eric Schweig is Hawkeye's gentle and valiant brother Uncas... His quiet tenderness for Alice adds emotional weight to what could be passionate and unique... He asserts hismythic stature in a battle on a mountain top with Magua, not only to determine the winner in a struggle between good and evil, but also to decide the destiny of a race...<br /><br />Steven Waddington is the last survivor of a troop of English soldiers caught by France's Indian allies... He is a jealous and snobbish officer who wants the radiant Cora at any price... Heyward brings some realistic touches of duality, showing his courage with one life-saving act...<br /><br />Maurice Roëves seems impotent as Munroe... His blindness to the realities of \\"honor\\" brings destruction...<br /><br />Patrice Ch&eacute;reau is the French General Montcalm who gives Magua the go ahead to attack Munro's retreating army... He begs Munrow not to sign the death warrant of so many, and promises safe passage for the English so long as they return to England and fight no more on the continent...<br /><br />The real inspiration of 'The Last of the Mohicans' is the extraordinary action sequences, the intensity of its music, and the exotic romanticism of such 1930's adventures as 'Charge of the Light Brigade', 'Gunga Din', and 'The Lives of a Bengal Lancer', where unshaken heroes never hesitate in the face of savage adversaries...<br /><br />Michael Mann's camera exploits the beauty of the North Carolina mysterious Smoky Mountains, its verdant forests, and its white-water rapids and waterfalls... The opening shot of the fog misting through the Smokies are enough to take your breath away...and unique...

B00011RPB0|2.0|This is Bill Murray doing his quiet I am barely here routine again. Like the guy in Broken Flowers, Rushmore and Life Aquatic. Strangely I liked all of those other movies, but this one was boring. It looks pretty and the performances are okay, but not enough happens, it is not romantic and it is most certainly not funny. <br /> <br />People keep speaking of all these cute social observations as if they require a meticulous or intelligent mind to capture or something. <br /> <br />I mean hello? It is no longer observationally witty to realize that the Japanese are short, have bizarre television shows and run American sit-coms with weird voiceovers. It is not much of a revelation that a person would be lonely in a strange land with different languages and customs. <br /> <br />This is not wit or subtlety. It is unfunny and boring. <br /> <br />I really liked the Virgin Suicides and I love Bill Murray, but I do not recommend this movie.
B0000009S3|5.0|I don't have the original vinyl version of this, but I don't really want it.  I find this a masterful album, and my favorite track is the now epic The Gumbo Variations.  Reportedly, it was rather short on the original release.  Zappa is, unfortunately, notorious for re-recording parts of his catalog (We're Only In It For The Money and Cruisin' with Ruben and the Jets are the most well known examples of this), but here (as in Sleep Dirt) this is what I believe Zappa originally intended.  I love this album, which may be the greatest jazz rock album ever recorded.  There is not one false note in the entire thing.
B000IMUYJM|5.0|this has to be the best slasher film ever......very creepy...good for 1974
B000H30B2C|4.0|It was the most powerful connection, I think, between a structure and a city and a fictional character that the 20th century had ever seen...<br /><br />Of all the \\"King Kong\\" films that exist, Peter Jackson's new Kong is, without any doubt, the best... The film won 3 Oscars, for sound editing, sound mixing, and visual effects... It is set in 1933 where America was facing economic troubles unlike any seen before...<br /><br />Jackson wanted 1933 New York to be very, very authentic... He recreates a chaotic, crazy, busy city bustling and vibrant... The streets were absolutely jam packed with cars, trams, buses, crowded with hawkers and thousands of people ... The Empire State Building had just been built...<br /><br />Jackson goes in the heart of New York and describes the Depression by showing private security forces raiding buildings; mass evictions of people who simply could not pay their rent; people winding up as squatters; and long line of people waiting to be fed...<br /><br />He gives a little hint about the Prohibition: police busting up an illegal still; Carl Delham getting a box of whiskey to take upon his trip and it's labeled \\"Lemonade.\\" And oddly enough, he presents the end of Prohibition, when we see some liquor advertising at the climax of the movie that wasn't there at the beginning...<br /><br />Jackson also introduces vaudeville... Vaudeville was a variety show, a string of acts put together to form a complete bill of entertainment... Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) was one of vaudeville good-looking actress who loses her job due to the lack of money...<br /><br />Skull Island was another very important location for Jackson... The amount of imagination and creativity that went into the ideas behind it is quite amazing... The zoology, the flora and fauna, the cultural history of that impossible island is thrilling... It was, indeed, a huge work to rebuild a hellish place of inexhaustible mysteries...<br /><br />We are talking about small group of desperate souls eking out the barest existence possible... Natives who have come to worship a giant gorilla--named \\"Kong\\" by them-- as some sort of god, practicing human sacrifice to appease his anger...<br /><br />We are also talking about a lush jungle and tropical rain forest with giant reptiles with very large feet to cope with the uneven and broken terrain of the island... We are talking not only about dinosaurs but also beasts just as terrible, or even worse... We're talking about a natural predator trap full of rotting carcasses and scavenger creatures... We are also talking about giant, parasitic, warm-like creatures which are much more than active predators and scavengers... We are talking about perils resided not only in the depths of the island but in the skies as well, where terrifying flying creatures ruled...<br /><br />\\"King Kong\\" delivers a fantasy-adventure piece, with its balance of peril and romance in much the same way \\"Titanic\\" did... The romance part is not where one would expect it, but involves a beast with a beautiful and fragile creature who experience a tender if unexplained bond... And this union is the finest moment of the film... Ann looks into the ape's eyes and sees something impressionable there... And the audience notices it too... Jackson has done something emotional here... In addition to the ape's beastly character, Kong gazes at Ann and shows true, endearing traits... We are struck by his protective nature as we can understand the desires of each to protect the other... Ann can't escape this fateful meeting that changes everything... It's as if her whole life has been a prelude to this moment...<br /><br />Jackson's \\"King Kong\\" is a grandiose thrilling adventure, sufficiently magical and colorful whether it's reverently watching a sunset, or doing some ice-skating ...l group of desperate souls eking out the barest existence possible...

B00003CXB2|5.0|David Lean's \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" is one of the few films that legitimately deserves to be called great... It appears on virtually all \\"ten best\\" lists and reveals deeper layers of meaning with repeated viewings...<br /><br />Lean, a man devoted to the art, gives \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" its spectacular values... He unifies the sand and the sun to flame out the silver screen... Maurice Jarre's terrific music escorts the appearance and disappearance of the sun below the horizon in the sleepy desert...<br /><br />\\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" is a prodigious labor, a masterful mixture of fact and artistry, a masterpiece of intimate moment and spectacular largesse, a film that literally excites the senses... In a visual sense, Lean combines a sure sense of place with an approach to the action that he borrows from an unlikely source--John Ford... Lean turns his vast desert canvas into another Monument Valley, and when his Bedouins ride across it, they are not far removed from Ford's cavalry... In many of the early scenes, the stately gait of the camel's walk gives the film a slower pace, and this is precisely what Lean is trying to achieve... Lean even manages to surpass Ford with his understanding of the relationship between his characters and the landscape; how the desert changes those who go into it...<br /><br />The film is the story of a solitary adventurer who always knew he was different, but in Arabia he discovers that his proportions are heroic... Perhaps this is the secret of Lawrence of the legends -- that at the bottom of all the violent action is a protagonist about whom one cares... A puzzling personality whom one glimpses but never fully understands... Throuhout the picture one has a sense of a man discovering his own unique dimensions...<br /><br />Lawrence's mission, largely his own creation, is to unite the feuding Bedouin tribes under the leadership of Prince Feisal (Alec Guinness), and to keep the British politicians, as personified by Mr. Dryden (Claude Rains), from putting the Arabs under their colonial thumb after World War I is over... It is accomplished through a semi-episodic series of battles and raids where Lawrence is sometimes accompanied by Ali (Omar Sharif) and Sheik Auda (Anthony Quinn), and equally difficult bureaucratic struggles he faces with Gen. Allenby (Jack Hawkins).<br /><br />All the conventional elements of the genre are at peaks of excellence here: The stretch desert with its white golden sands; peril, anywhere and everywhere; danger-for Lawrence of Arabia is a film about guerrilla warfare; prowess-Lawrence crosses Sinai on foot; physical torture-Lawrence in the hands of the Turkish bey; impossible mission- Lawrence takes the seaport of Jordan from behind; ruthlessness-Lawrence shouting 'take no prisoners' leading his men to put to death a Turkish column...<br /><br />Every component is here, everything one needs for a great adventure film, many spectacular sequences, each of them so perfect: Lean cuts to the sun again and again, turning it into a character; the scene in Feisal's tent when Lawrence first talks with the king; Lawrence striding on top of a captured train, parading before rows of cheering Arabs; the scene between Lawrence and Ferrer illuminating Lawrence's strange perversity, a mixture of masochism and repressed homosexuality; the scene when a Beduin prince appears on his camel, an exceedingly long take in which a strange figure is first resolved out of waves of heat and then, as he approaches, becomes a frightening threat to Lawrence's escort at the desert well...<br /><br />The photography, the script and the acting are so superb that \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" becomes a lavish epic winner of 7 Academy Awards for Best Picture, Directing, Color, Cinematography, Sound, Muscial Score and Film Editing...Rains), from putting the Arabs under their colonial thumb after World War I is over...

The drawings present the animals in action in an attractive way.  The drawing steps are kept to a few major sketches for each animal, which seem to be about right for a child or person who enjoys drawing and seems to have a bit of a knack for it but would be turned off by too many technical instructions.

If you were offended by topics in The DaVinci Code, you will probably be offended by this book.
B0008KLVG4|4.0|The film opens with a shot of a group of teenagers enjoying a campfire out on Amity beach... A couple leaves the group for a midnight swim...<br /><br />The silhouette of a woman is seen in full flight toward the sea... Her dress, bra, and panties fly toward her drunk admirer who can't make a fist to catch them...<br /><br />In a delicate splash, Chrissie goes swimming in the cold ocean, drawing herself into deeper water...<br /><br />When a wave of pressure lifts her up and eases her down, her face begins to show a certain fear... Her eyes go to the beach where her friend, too drunk to stand, is struggling with his shoe...<br /><br />Chrissie turns and starts for shore... But her expression freezes... Something terrible is hurting her underneath... She struggles with all her forces, but she is soon submerged in a horrifying scene...<br /><br />Police Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) reacts quickly to the news of shark attack, and emerges with enough poster-board, wooden stakes, nails, paint and brushes to close every beach on the island...<br /><br />But as Amity is a beautiful summer resort with clean air, clear water, and beautiful white sand beaches...

B000EHSVQ4|4.0|This is one film where the director's cut totally exceeds the theatrical release, in fact the two are virtually completely different movies. I saw Kingdom Of Heaven on HBO and despite being made by one of my favorite directors Ridley Scott, it was a total borefest...and most critics and moviegoers alike agreed as proven by the lousy reviews and box office turnout. I took a chance buying the rather expensive 4 disc director's cut after reading a glowing review by our local movie critic who had previously given the theatrical release a very bad review. I love historical films so I was glad the gamble paid off. By no means is it Scott's best work but it is a very good bordering on great movie...I would've given it a 5 star review if 15-20 minutes were cut off but unlike the shorter theatrical release, the 4 hour director's cut has a great story that flows, intense battle scenes, and even Orlando Bloom's wooden acting in a 4 hour setting is more tolerable. The design of the cover and box is really nice, I haven't watched the extras but there's lots to keep you busy if you're fascinated by The Crusades or movie-making. If you're considering purchasing Kingdom of Heaven, shell out a few more bucks for the Director's Cut.

B00006AW2M|3.0|TSMR was somewhat unfairly slagged when it came out as nothing more than a clumsy Sergeant Pepper rip-off. It's true that In Another Land sounds like Lucy in the Sky With Severe Brain Damage, and it's hard to hear On With the Show as anything other than the Stones' version of Pepper's title track. And the overall shimmery sound and gentle peace and love vibe do seem more characteristic of the Beatles than the blues-loving Stones. <br /> <br />But they didn't just steal from the Beatles. To these ears, the verse melody of Citadel sounds an awful lot like the Strawberry Alarm Clock's big hit Incense and Peppermints. And the loose psychedelic jams throughout the album, particularly the reprise of Sing This All Together, owe more to the improvisational experiments that had been conducted in London nightclubs by The Pink Floyd and The Soft Machine for over a year (to say nothing of \\"the San Francisco sound\\", of which the Stones may or may not have been aware) than to the Fab Four's carefully crafted concoctions. If I was more of a scholar I could probably find non-Liverpublian antecedents for some of the other tracks here too. <br /> <br />But, as Picasso once supposedly said, good artists copy and great artists steal, and while there is a bit of copying going on here, much of this is just the Stones stealing, taking what they found, what was in the air at the time (like, say, fusing Western classical and/or Indian music with rock, which a lot of bands had been messing around with, not just the Beatles), and trying to make it their own.  <br /> <br />Sometimes they succeeded: She's A Rainbow, 2000 Light Years From Home, maybe Dandelion, and personally I like the first version of Sing This All Together (if you listen carefully you can hear John Lennon and Paul McCartney, most distinctly Lennon, singing in the background) and consider The Lantern to be a guilty pleasure.  <br /> <br />But it must be said: this is the worst of the pre-Goats Head Soup albums. It's the only one that has songs that are flat-out unlistenable, like the aforementioned In Another Land (embarrassing) and Gomper (sorry Brian Jones fans, but once that shrieking Noh-type flute comes in, I'm out). 2000 Man starts out well but then kinda falls apart. And the best that can be said of the 8:33 jam version of Sing This All Together is that you get to hear Mick say \\"Where's that joint?\\" It's fun to listen to a couple of times, maybe, but you'll be skipping over it before you know it. <br /> <br />Of course, right after this they decided to just they own nasty selves and recorded possibly their best album, Beggar's Banquet.
B000JLTRKE|2.0|Despite the fact I can't stand Oliver Stone as a person as he's an annoying communist propaganda spin meister, I do love his films (note: Alexander is the only film of his I have not seen). World Trade Center is not one of them and is his worst movie along with Nixon which was a laughably pathetic blatant slander of the ex-President by another whining uppity Hollywood leftist director who lives in a palatial estate while praising the achievements of Fidel Castro and the Cuban Revolution and crying about the plight of the homeless. Surprisingly Stone doesn't get political on this project, this is an honest portrayal of human survival against all odds. The movie is long, and considering it is about the two NYC firemen who were trapped under the rubble for days...it feels even longer. Call me insensitive but I have no other way of saying it, not much is going to happen in a movie about two men pinned and piled underneath a mound of concrete and steel and Lord knows what else...though you'll probably have to shake yourself awake here and there, this movie is well worth watching though I wouldn't recommened buying and owning as it probably won't get many views after. This is the most tragic historical event in our lifetime and this is just one of thousands of examples of heroism that occurred in the aftermath, though I'd of rather seen a movie adaptation of Last Man Out about the last guy that made it out the Towers, a bit more exciting than the two guys pinned under the rubble.

We did it for the ozone layer, water pollution, cigarette smoking, etc. We can do it again but we all have to make some sacrifices. We can be as one and accomplish so much or we can remain in denial until there is no looking back. Think of Katrina on the grandest scale we have ever seen. <br /> <br />This movie is really worth seeing.  I think the last year is a strong indication of what is happening.  The ice shelf in the North Pole collapsing, South Dakota at 120 degrees (I was there!), rain in Minnesota on New Year's Eve..... none of this is normal.  Those who say this is cyclical are truly in denial and those who think this is political need to think twice.   <br /> <br />I feel a responsiblity to those that come after me.  Previous generations felt that responsibility which is why we have National Parks, protected species, etc.  This is the responsibility of our generation and we cannot take it lightly.  We did not create all of it but we need to deal with it. I hope we're not too late.
B0006B29Z2|5.0|Though I've been a huge Iron Maiden fan for over 20 years and have tons of videos including bootlegs, it took me a while to pick up this one...and after viewing it I must say I was very impressed as this is without question their best and definitive video to date...and this is only Part 1! To be honest I've been getting somewhat tired of the band as of late they've been releasing so much live material...a live double album/DVD after each studio album/tour plus that boxset which seems to have neverending endless live versions of \\"Sanctuary\\" and \\"Iron Maiden\\" but watching and listening to this DVD made me realize once again what a great ferocious band Iron Maiden is in the live setting. The concert footage and documentary material deal with the band's history from their very beginnings in 1975 till the Piece Of Mind era circa 1983.  <br /> <br />Disc 1 is all concert footage. It starts off with Live at the Rainbow from 1980 which features Paul Di'Anno as well as Adrian Smith who had just joined the band, this was right before their 2nd album Killers was to be recorded and released. The video has been around for years though very hard to find and now looks and sounds better than ever. For those of you who've never witnessed or heard the Di'Anno era live this is a must-have, while only about a 1/2 hour in length, the sheer power of the band in their early days will floor you...it's funny seeing when Dave Murray was young, he was moving and banging his head all over the place while when I saw them live not long ago he just stood and smiled for 2 hours, not that there's anything wrong with that, he must be pushing 50!  <br /> <br />The next two concerts, both about 45 minutes each are from the next two tours with their then new singer Bruce Dickinson. Beast Over Hammersmith was initially supposed to be released officially as a concert video but some poor lighting caused the band to scrap those plans. I could be wrong but I do not believe all the songs from that original show are here but the most important ones are, plus the audio sound is out of this world. Live At Dortmund recorded during the Piece of Mind tour featuring their then new drummer Nicko McBrain has quite a few tracks missing that supposedly were lost or destroyed and while it is an important document of the band's history, the audio quality wasn't as good as the other two previous concerts but they still pulled off the energy the other two possessed. <br /> <br />Disc 2 is chock full of everything you'll ever want to know about Iron Maiden. Starting with a 90 minute documentary called The Early Days, there's tons of interviews with current and many past members as well as more live footage and rare photos nevermind lots of info on the band that many are not aware of such as the fact that Paul Di'Anno is actually the band's third vocalist plus they went through countless numbers of guitarists and even a keyboard player before recording their first album. Some advice for you Yanks...you might want to select subtitle mode on your DVD player for the interviews. Some of the old members are interviewed for the documentary, besides a couple who let themselves go they all look like accountants or something. Another documentary about 20 minutes in length recorded in Britain in 1980 just after the band got signed is also of interest, and good for laughs with the cheezy 80s intro, the host, and early 80s headbangers with cardboard guitars and bad teeth. There's yet another concert, some homemade videotaped show called Live at the Ruskin which is around the time the first album came out and has the seldom seen Dennis Stratton who actually sounds way better singing backup here than he did on the first album...interesting to note Steve Harris says somewhere in the video that he doesn't like the first album so much because of the production. There's also some music performences from British and German TV shows, kind of like what we used to have here in the States with Solid Gold. All the band's music videos from this point of time are also presented, as well as tons of photos, Steve Harris' diary during their beginnings, and even all the tour programs...my only complaint is especially with the tour programs you'll need a large screen TV to read the written segments on the pages. There's a few easter eggs, when you go to main menu on the different sections on disc 2, press the down arrow button and it'll go to an icon of what looks like two crossed axes. Though I haven't heard or read any info regarding future releases of The History of Iron Maiden, I suspect Part II will probably have the long sought after Live After Death and maybe Maiden England finally on DVD.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I didn't see Firefly when it first ran on TV, but after I saw the movie Serenity, I had to have more, and \\"discovered\\" the Firefly series on DVD.   <br /> <br />While the characters and the overall concept of the movie and the series are the same, they aren't really related.  One is not a continuation of the other.  Rather, they are better described as parallel efforts to tell a similar story.  Both are excellent, and both stand on their own. <br /> <br />Forget transporter rooms and warp speeds.  To me, space travel as envisioned by Joss Whedon in this series is more realistic.  His view of desperate individuals in cobbled together spacecraft, making a living as best they can, seems a more likely future than the blue-water Navy goes to space concepts seen elsewhere. <br /> <br />However, in the Firefly series, it's really the characters that stand out and make the show what it is.  The entire cast does an excellent job.  After a few episodes, I realized that they had become part of my family, and after the last episode, I felt a real sense of loss that they were gone. <br /> <br />When you watch the series for the first time, watch \\"Serenity - Part 1 & 2\\" first, and \\"The Message\\" last. <br />
B00005PJ8O|4.0|Anyone interested in the military history of the second world war or the life of George Patton will enjoy this work. It does a fair job in historical accuracy of the events that surrounded his contraversial career and demonstrates the character, flaws and all, that made him so. Though Mr. George C. Scott's voice matches the General's character more than his actual voice, the casting choice was otherwise a perfect match. A fantastic biographical work of the scrappy general.
B0006GAI6Y|5.0|This is a meaningful story done well, even for those who don't dance. Richard Gere, Jennifer Lopez, and Susan Sarandon are decent people, and it is delightful to see a movie with minimal swear words, no violence, and no illicit sex. The musical score is very good as well.
B000J10EQU|3.0|All he does is fly around and lifts heavy objects! The three main action scenes in this film involves him flying around and lifting heavy objects to save people, in the DVD cover is him lifting a plane from the dramatic though a bit too long scene in the film...I don't know why they chose that image for the cover artwork, I preferred the movie poster of him standing over the world. Still this is a good movie, not great by any means, but certainly better than Superman II (both versions) and the other two after which I personally don't even consider part of the franchise. If they had chopped a half hour off this movie I'd of probably liked it even more...Brandon Routh is a worthy successor, IMO better than Christopher Reeve who always came across as geeky even in his Superman tights...Routh better make more demands monetarily when they do the follow-up as the stories that have been linked show he wasn't very well taken care of doing this movie. Kevin Spacey is the perfect Lex Luthor, as good as Gene Hackman's. Look for a cameo by the original Jimmy Olsen from the old television series playing a bartender. Overall a good film, could've been better but it couldn't be worse...and that's a fact considering Richard Pryor is dead.
B000JLTRJ0|2.0|I didn't like this film as much as I did United 93 and I would recommend that you purchase United 93 instead.
0783226837|5.0|One of the best humorous scary monster movies of all time.  I've watched it at least 8 times.  Own it on VHS, then bought it on DVD.  Highly recommend it for older teens and up.  Memorable \\"F-bomb\\" language.
B000F0UUT6|5.0|This mini-series was my introduction to Jane Austen. Seriously, I had gone my whole life not reading Jane Austen because I thought it was all girly stuff. I had no idea the political intrigue a simple courtship could produce. With all the scheming and plotting in this mini-series, it didn't feel girly at all. This book is less about love and more about humans in general.<br /><br />I love Mr. Darcy! Who knew a proud crabcake like him could be so charming!
B0002X314C|1.0|was dissappointed that an album this highly regarded contained as much graphic language as it did.  I'll skip the moralizing on what depths society has reached to, (scratch that, I think I just did) but I'm shocked an award winning album can be this crass
0340840323|2.0|'Little Face' opens with a new-mother returning home after 2 hours at the gym to find that the baby in the nursery is not the baby that she gave birth to just a few weeks ago. The story then proceeds to uncover the truth behind a murder of someone in the family some years ago while investigating into the alleged \\"baby-swapping\\".  However, the truth that is finally revealed to the reader at the conclusion of the book is far from chilling and brilliant.    The story has a good plot but the poor writing and the weak conclusion failed to support it. Instead of exploiting the intriguing \\"baby-swapping\\" plot, the author chose to hone it down and gave it an ending that is no doubt much easier to write. There is nothing smart about the conclusion as it was something that could be easily guessed halfway through the book. In addition, the way the author switched between the mother's and the investigating detective's point of view was disruptive to the opening rhythm and suspense of the book. The only reason that I kept on reading till the end was to find out if the conclusion that I had arrived at halfway through the book was indeed correct. But I would caution you that it was definitely a tedious read.       I would not recommend this book unless you're terribly bored and have just finished re-reading the obituaries page on the newspaper.
1400049628|5.0|Now I finally feel like I'm prepared for the next zombie outbreak! This was an informative guide not only for zombie outbreak survival but also for other natural and un-natural disasters. A very interesting read!
B00065HU9S|5.0|I loved this book and am going to read all his other books now because this book is so awesome.  I never figured out the ending, either.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|Great!! Good enough to play Year round.Unique selection of songs and she is outstanding ---as Usual. <br />

B000BTC5LW|5.0|This is a great dvd. I wish it would have more songs. I didn't buy it here though. I preordered and then cancelled then they sent it and billed me. I was mad but they made it up to me. If you love concert dvd's you need this.
B000H305U0|5.0|I will admit that I am a biased JT fan, but this CD is so good!  Even my boyfriend and his friends like it.  It's great dance or workout music.  Get it, you'll be happy you did!
B000FIMG68|4.0|I'm a huge fan of the show, so it was nice to watch many epidodes again, only now I can see them back-to-back, without commercials. The bonus features are caal, too. And the price was right.
B000IJ79WU|4.0|Richard Donner is still mad. He's a pretty cantankerous guy, and most directors don't like their projects being stolen, especially when their work is half-finished, and they don't particularly like daily reminders of that shoved in their face until they're dead.  Lester kind of got shafted too. He didn't want to take over the Superman series, that was the Salkinds, who are crazy, I tell you. Lester may have been a cynic (he could not understand how adventure stories could take themselves so seriously) and the Salkinds basically browbeat him into taking over directorial duties on S2, but not all of his scenes were terrible. Case in point:    I liked how Clark basically screwed himself and blew his secret to Lois just because he was sick of not being able to talk about it. Because Donner wanted to hold onto every scene he had intended to film, now Lois blasts Clark with a revolver. Which is an interesting way to go about it, but wouldn't Superman tell if it was a blank or not? Besides that, the scene is made up entirely of test footage from when they were casting Clark and Lois, and most of it doesn't match up, and even Reeve's hair and glasses are totally different (funny, I think they look cooler than his regular ones).     Once you recover from this jarring experience, Donner starts cutting from one scene to another without a bridge. So zealous is he in ripping apart the Lester stuff, including Zod terrorizing hillbillies, that stuff is just left hanging there. Apparently Donner even had a problem with the whiny dolt who played the human general, because he dubbed in a tougher man's voice (\\"AH ANSWER ONLAH TO THE PRESIDENT!\\") that doesn't even synch and looks ridiculous. Then comes the ending, where Superman spins the world backwards to turn back time, because we didn't get enough of THAT in Superman 1. Only...that means he beats up the jerk in the diner for no reason, because the guy doesn't remember punching him.    I was looking forward to the lost Brando footage, which is pretty seamless and works better. The problem is that when Superman is telling him to take away his powers becase he wants to be with Lois, he comes across like a stuck-up teenager and sneers a lot. It was so bad I wondered if I was watching more test footage. As things roll along, I was grateful just to see the extra scenes with Clark, even though most of it is inconsequential, and we miss out on the grueling scene with Lois having a nervous breakdown from carrying the knowlege of Clark's identity. Though I can't say I miss the retarded amnesia-kiss, we lose that scene entirely in favor of a \\"Well, uh, here we are\\" scene on Lois' rooftop, which just plays awkward.    I'm torn, as I suspect most will be with this product.  I liked the extended action sequences and the Brando monologues, but the pacing is all wrong and I miss the emotional element that the original Superman 2 had. I would rather have a rereleased Superman II set with both versions, but can't have everything I guess.  This is a cool novelty, and it comes with a big disclaimer (Donner: \\"This is how I envisioned the movie!\\" *beats chest*). Also it was cool seeing Zod brandishing a M16 in the White House.  All in all, I think this compares the work of two very competant directors, and Lester is not the bogeyman who destroyed the Superman francise with this movie. That's Superman 3's job.
B000F8O35U|4.0|Great DVD to own. The only complaint is that it says it has games but it doesn't, just an interactive ride which my seven year old said was \\"pretty boring\\". So great DVD, but with all the hype;expected more.
0060776579|5.0|The audio CD book is perfect for me as I travel a lot with my business.  Don't have much time to read.  The Secrets of the Millionaire Mind is an awesome tool for those serious about discovering their inner wealth, as I started using/doing the suggestions I have gone from $500/month residual income to $600/WEEK!  I definitely have A MILLIONAIRE MIND!
0425200450|5.0|To begin with, do NOT buy this book from Amazon. The mass market paperback is priced in the bookstore at $5.99, but on Amazon it is $6.99 plus shipping. Just go to the bookstore and pick it up.<br /><br />This is one of the most interesting murder mysteries I have ever read. Every little element, every little slip of the tongue by each of the suspects, every piece of evidence - real or faked - will keep you guessing right up until the end. I just kept reading and reading late into the night because the evidence and suspects were so confusing. I changed my mind about who was the true murderer at least four times. I won't reveal the actual plot, but it will surprise you right up to the last page.<br /><br />This is actually the first Agatha Christie mystery that I have read (surprisingly) and I'm glad that I picked it up. Although there were times that I considered everything about Hercule Poirot to be almost cheesy, in the end his methods were justified, and I really enjoyed the story. I will definitely pick up a few more Poirot mysteries in the coming future.
1597371416|5.0|I enjoyed the recent movie Pride and Prejudice so much that I just had to read the book.  I don't have time to actually sit down and read a novel, so I purchased the audio version.  I was very pleased with it.  I thought the narrator was excellent.  Wonderful Book!
B000BISBDY|5.0|This CD is classic Johnny and for anyone who loves Johnny Cash and Country Music it is a MUST have!!
B0002F6AH0|5.0|This is the best!  I purchased this for my husband but we watch it together.  The research was unbelieveable.  Even though this was produced in 1974 it is a timeless experience.
0060245867|5.0|My Grandson enjoyed this book very much, as did his grandmother :)
0316666343|4.0|Lovely, Sweet and Sad.  This book is a good and fast book to read.  It is frightening how the main character comes to be the voice in the story but a sad fact of life in these times. This book is well written and i enjoyed it a great deal.
B00000ING2|5.0|loved this movie, great story and the acting was supurb. John Mahoney is great pre Frazier.
B000GY729M|5.0|The KIllers have definitely upped their game. No sophomore slump here. This CD shows some definite progress and maturity with tracks like \\"When You Were Young,\\" \\"Uncle Johnny,\\" and \\"This River is Wild.\\" There's also the signature Killers style with songs like \\"Bones.\\" Overall, the CD is fun and entertaining, but it also gets you thinking and you can't help feeling the emotion in Brandon Flowers' voice when you listen.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I love this cd.  Everytime I listen to it I understand a little more.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|This cd has anything I could want.  It has very mellow songs and upbeat songs.  John Mayer actually covers Jimi Hendrix.  You can't ask for much more than that.  There is a lot more guitar work than his previous albums.  It is definitely more mature than his other work.  The only song I'm not a huge fan of is 'in repair', but it's only one song.  I love the rest of the album.
B000FIMG68|5.0|title said it all, this season answered so many new questions... yet had so many more questions to be answered. <br />cant wait till feb 16th
1582701709|4.0|The idea of 'seeing what you want and getting it' has been done before but this book was enjoyable. I enjoyed The Secret Language of Hypnotherapy by John Smale as a guide to visualizing and affirming goals. I also read the idea in God's Day Off but in a more mystical way. Despite that, I enjoyed The Secret and the way in which it was written.
B000F3AAUW|3.0|I love the song Crazy and that is the only reason I bought this cd.  The rest of the cd is nothing like that song.
B00005MP58|4.0|This is one of the best versions of Jane Austen's Pride ande Prejudice, and the main reason for the high rating is Colin Firth.  His acting as the indomitable Mr. Darcy is superb.  However, there are 2 drawbacks in my opinion: 1) the length, and 2) the casting (specifically, Jane Bennet and Mrs. Bennet).  Otherwise, the movie would receive a 5 star rating from me.  I wish I could combine the best of this version of P & P with the BBC version.  Then it would be one I would watch many times.
B00005JNDZ|5.0|I love both the Bridget movies!  Even my husband said that they are funny.  This is a movie I can watch over and over and over again!
B00003OO3O|4.0|This is a really good album to listen to , it has a  mix between hard rock tunes with good vocal melodies.The song that blew my mind is Mother Mary it sounds very modern . Just try and buy this album!!!!
0060776579|2.0|Just a lot of old talk and hype,normal thinking people should already have this study built into their system.May be people like guru tell them how to find the simpler things in life or may be it's a way to make easy money.OK this is America the wise shall live of the fools.I give this two stars just because I have the cd,and I can listen to know how others are thinking.
B00008EYBW|5.0|Persuasion is by far my favorite movie version of all of Jane Austen's novels.  The plot is true to the book, and the casting and acting of the characters are very believeable.  Austen's world truly comes alive for me as I watch, and I am transported back to the Regency period of 19th century England.  Amanda Root as Anne Elliot is especially good as she transforms from mousy and unsure to a confident, pretty woman who attracts two very eligible men.  I definitely rate this movie 5 stars.
B0002W4SWC|5.0|I love both the Bridget movies!  Go ahead and get the second movie if you don't have it.  You'll want to see it anyway!
0393061434|2.0|Its a great pity that Steve Wozniak hasn't taken the opportunity this book has afforded him to blow his own trumpet a bit more. I counted at least half a dozen sentences that weren't self serving. Steve Jobs, if you are reading this, good news mate ... heat's off!!!  I've not read it but I bet Mein Kamph is less self serving than this. Ouch!!!! And Gina (she co-wrote it), couldn't you stop him?, some kind of head lock would have worked, oh except you would never have got your arms around his.
0399241515|4.0|The book is number 5 in the Alex Rider adventures the book is one of the best in the series. Tho the best I think is, is Ark Angle the 6th in the series and cureltly the last.
B000GW88ZQ|5.0|What a great cd!!! What a sound, what a rhythm! The songs remind me of my own \\"discotime\\", and I'm having so much fun listening to this music. Makes me feel like dancing! Thank you Madonna! Please move on!  <br />But why do you put two videoclips and their making-ofs only onto the Japan-CD? Your fans do not understand that!!! <br />  <br />
B0000683DH|5.0|Forget \\"one of the best\\", This is THE best Star Trek movie EVER.  While I like all of them because I am such a Star Trek fan, This is the one movie I could watch over and over.  The Director's cut is the one to own if you can't get enough and want all the extras.
B000HCO83Q|4.0|This is the best one of all three. even though i dont like what they did to rouge's character or the fact that they didnt have gambit. Other than that it was great.

0385337388|5.0|I read this hilarious and thought provoking book years ago while a student at Georgetown Medical School. I re-read it every few years to recapture memories of the insane and craziness situation of being an intern at a big time teaching hospital. The book reads better as time passes by. One needs to read it with an open mind and avoid being so judgemental of the cynical and silliness nature of the characters and events inside the House of God or so many other similar Houses of God out there in this country. For those who are not in the medical profession, it is still a terrific guide inside the mind of medical professionals.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|Had high expectations for this album after listening to Absolution in a heavy rotation for a while.  At first I wasn't loving the album Black Holes and Revelations, but the more I listen to it the better it gets.  I have now started to put it into my daily rotation at work to get me through the day.  Would really like to see these guys in concert some day.  Highly recommend the album.
0192547011|4.0|The type was readable, illustrations interesting. Most of the pages were slightly misprinted in that a word(s) that belonged on the following pages were printed by themselves at the bottom of each page. No part of the text appeared to have been lost by this mistake.<br /><br />I did not find the comments, appendix useful.
B000GRUS22|3.0|This last effort is not the best by Engima.  I'd put it at the bottom of the list for my Enigma faves.  Sure it's a good CD and true to the Enigma style.  In this new line-up for Enigma, I miss the old line-up.  I feel this could have been a much better album with the old line up.  It's good to listen to at night with the lights out as is the rest of Enigma's albums but I'd turn the volume down or take out all the bass or your head will be thumping.  The main fault I have with this CD is the use of bass drums and bass guitar.  In every song they just thump and thump and thump which is a distraction from the rest of the music.  This is mostly an instrumental CD with very little singing on this one.  This is one Enigma CD that I wouldn't reach for first.  I think I'm more disappointed with this one than I am pleased.  If you're a hard core Enigma fan then I'd recommend this one.  If not, find someone who has a copy and have a listen then make your decision. <br />
B000FIMG68|4.0|After the smashing and surprising success of the first season, the second season takes off (with a good head start) where the first one ended. The bonus material is very extensive and very good, especially the deleted scenes, but that is a personal favourite of mine anyway.  <br />I rate this product four stars (of five), not because of any of the bonus features or the quality, but simply because where the first season was great from start to finish, the second has some scenes that are just a little borderline credibility-wise. But if you loved the first season, you have to watch the second!
B00000IFWE|4.0|One More Day, One More Night makes me want to give it 5 stars (the albums closer)  but I don't think that is right. Still, you should own this album and rock out to it. If you love Tom Petty, you will love this album. <br /> <br />Not Pettys' best, but that doesn't matter. It's still excellent.
6305781427|3.0|I've always liked Yanni since I heard his CD \\"Yanni - Live at the Acropolis\\" some six / seven years ago.  I recently purchsed an HDTV, so I decided to purchase the DVD (which I liked when I saw it first on Public TV).  I was very disappointed by the video quality.  but I still love the music!
B000002MUN|5.0|Yes own the Greatest Hits, please do so. But make sure you have Full Moon Fever and this gem also. <br /> <br />The B-Side to this is even better than the A in my mind. <br /> <br />This album is what made me decide Petty is one of the greatest musical writers of all time. <br /> <br />He can rub elbows with the Beatles (actually did with George) and day of the week.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|Prince con este album me sorprendio por el talento que manera de sonar y sobre todo se nota que todo los arreglos tiene su toque personal <br />para los fanaticos de prince deben tener este disco en su colección
0060934913|4.0|Having a passion for cooking and other culinary endeavors, I heard about this book through numerous cooking programs.  It was a great read if one is not familiar with the intricacies of the culinary world and it truly instills an appreciation for the profession and the years of struggle and work that goes into it.  Like any other profession, success builds from passion and you can genuinely feel Bourdain's passion for cooking and food and his career.  Aside from the insight into cooking and the profession, I think the book offers deeper insight into character and humanity.  There is respect and admiration from Bourdain from those lower on the cooking totem pole, from the runners, cooks, grill man, to those higher than him.  He tells you the positives and negatives, what he loves about the profession and what he hates, but the positives inevitably outweigh the negatives.  And through all that he has been through, the drugs use, the low points, there is never any regret, but only true gratitude for what he has achieved and the person that he has become because of it all.  I think it offers more than a lesson in the culinary underbelly, but a lesson in living life with no regrets if you are happy with the person you've become and the profession you chose.
B000002U9L|4.0|I enjoyed this soundtrack, but I love this movie also! Anybody that doesn't like the movie is more than likely not going to like this.
B0000TG9E2|5.0|Great movie, my daughter loves it.   It came in good time.  Thanks Alot...
6304808038|5.0|Sleuth is a 2 person movie with Sir Lawrence Olivier, and Michael Caine that treats the viewer to a twisting story of ingrigue and humor and suspense, a cat n mouse drama that is well worth owning
B0000024JN|5.0|I got your attention you see WHITE RAPPERS and think oh no here we go again. Well I have to say I have been listening to hip hop for 25 years now and have over 45,000 records yeah im 37 but know more about hip hop than the average person on the Street. Back to the review when this album came out it was 1986 and no one had really heard of these guys but after all the hype started it was like a wild fire. Me being a white guy was blown away by these guys as I had something to relate to. Well when I bought this album I was amazed at how many cuts were that good on the album Brass Monkey and Paul Revere are my two favorites on there. I was like I have to see these guys in concert which I did in 1986. My first concert I had ever been to and it was going to be the Beastie Boys I was in awe going to the Capital Center in Landover to see these guys. Well I got to the Cap Center to see them and this group opened up for them some group called Public Enemy who was fairly new but really sounded good. Hell who would know at that time that they would become one of the greatest hip hop groups of all time and here I am watching Chuck,Flav and Terminator X perform. Well PE did there thing and I was a fan right there after they were done. Well the Buzz was going in the Cap Center waiting for the Beastie Boys to come on. They finally came on and I was hyped up for this. When the lights came on there were females danceing in cages and a giant inflatable Penis on stage. I was sitting there at 16 and like there living the life. Well they came out and did there thing had the beer on stage and were like crack heads :) They had so much energy through out the show they never slowed down at all. To this day I am still a fan of the Beastie Boys and support them. Thanks for a great concert in 1986.

B0000029GA|5.0|This is high up there as a lot of people favorite all time record as it should be. This was Nas first album and it hit people like a bomb. How many singles on here sound good all of them thats because Nas took his time in putting this out and when he did a classic was born. Like one of my early reviews for Boogie Down Productions Criminal Minded it was the cover that got your attention. It comes down to a cover a lot of times to get a hold of people and this one did. Also the buzz of this album when it first came out. It aint hard to tell was all over college radios and hip hop clubs the beat really laid back and the lyrics blew peoples minds away. There are more hits on here and I dont know how many remixes were done like maybe 10 for all of the cuts on this album. It aint hard to tell has like 4-5 remixes done that you would have to dig deep for. They sau hip op is dead maybe it is but when you listen to this classic album it is alive for at least an hour much respect to Nas for droping this album.
B000092T6M|5.0|I have loved this movie since I watched it in high school on the bus for fieldtrips.  This is an excellent movie.  It is a movie that unlike many of the movies that come out now actually have a story and complete the story not leaving it open for a sequel.  There is action and adventure with a mild love story throw in, but not the premise.  My husband watched this movie for the first time when I bought this and he enjoyed it as well.
B00006JSS8|5.0|I got this for the one song on it.  SIR DUKE.  Am happy with it.
B0007LXPBI|5.0|I know this is billed as a teen movie, but I have to admit that it is one of my very favorites (my kids bought it for me for Christmas).    I've watched it numerous times with my daughters  and none of us seem to tire of it.   I think Natasha Richardson and Dennis Quaid have quite a bit of chemistry between them, love the back-story between the maid and the butler, and really think that Lindsay Lohan is terrific as Hallie/Annie.   I've seen the original version and while I do enjoy it, I just like this one so much better.   It's just really good, clean fun that the whole family can enjoy.   <br /> <br />I also agree that the CD is worth getting, with many songs that are fun and enjoyable.  I guess one downside to the remake is the omission of the 'Let's Get Together' song, but it was always too syrupy for my taste, so I don't mind that Disney didn't add it to the remake.
0689835604|5.0|Karen Katz has produced yet another educational, interactive book for parent and child. Through bright illustrations and peekaboo flaps, children are introduced to body parts and positional words. It is a delight as well for big brothers/sisters to share this book with the little ones in the family. We highly recommend this and all of Karen Katz' terrific books!
B000B7QCKE|5.0|This concert is breath taking, Yanni has the best musicians and a violonist that has enough talent to be on her own. Very well produced, worth every penny of it. I was able to fully enjoy in the comfort of my living view, this grandiose performance!!! Kudos for Yanni and his ensemble.
0446677450|5.0|Rich Dad, Poor Dad should be mandatory reading. It changed the way I view money and made me realized that I work too hard for too little. This helped me build a foundation towards financial security and freedom.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|A masterpiece. A worn out word, yes. But this CD is a jewel. In the same league as \\"Time Out of Mind\\" and \\"Love and Theft.\\" If you admired the latter two CDs, you'll also admire/love this one.
B000FIMG68|5.0|If you've watched this show at all, you have to love it.  I've been hooked from the beginning and it makes it so easy to watch it back to back with the DVD set.
B00008NG5V|5.0|This is the first Cd Of Jack Johnsons I ever heard and Fell in love with it........Bubble Toes Was my favorite Track......Another must have for the music collection
B000F39MAQ|5.0|This is an excellent production of this opera.  The stage design is dazzling, the music so beautiful, and the singing of Anna Netrebko and Rolando Villazon gorgeous.  These are two of the greatest singers of our time and their singing together has a indescribeable magnetism.   In addition, I believe Rolando Villazon to be the greatest operatic actor of this age and perhaps all other ages.  His attraction to audiences is difficult to describe but he becomes the character he is portraying and the audience can relate to this.  It is not enough to just hear him sing; one must see him visually to appreciate the hold he can have on an audience.  And Ms. Netrebko, what can be said.  She has beauty, acting ability, and a fine voice.  In some roles (mainly of the bel canto style), she has been criticized for not being able to sing these as correctly as they should be sung, but her performance in \\"La Traviata\\" is superb.   I highly recommend purchasing this dvd.  The audio and video are both superb and the dvd is well worth the investment. There is also an additional dvd showing backstage highlights and commentary by Villazon which is really quite enjoyable.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|I bought this movie on a whim.  I wasn't sure how much I would like it, however, with nothing else to watch I decided to give it a shot.  I was pleasantly suprised.  Many reviewers have pointed out the many flaws of the characters, and dismiss the movie as pointless or crude.  What many fail to realize is that the story isn't about the characters themselves, but the love of a family of quirky, crazy people.  The movie starts by showing how disfunctional the family is, and how ill prepared they are to deal with a crisis.  However, with the love they have for each other, they are able to overcome their own shortcomings, and help each other rise above the pettiness around them.  When the movie ended, I realized that they are in fact the most normal people at the beauty pagent, and are a stronger family for having traveled together.  I highly recommend this movie.
B000F0UUT6|2.0|Unfortunately, this set was a disappointment.  I understood that only certain cast members were going to be interviewed in the \\"extra\\" DVD special features.  Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle are not among them.  I was hoping though that it would have been a more behind the scenes documentary.  It wasn't.  What you get are about 5 cast members sitting in chairs talking about the movie, and many of the things that they say are already included in the booklet that comes with this set.  So the special features do not offer anything new or different.  I also found the commentary by Adrian Lukas (Mr. Wickam) to be vulgar and tasteless.  His testimony was an ode to being excessively drunk, and it ended up sounding like the boasting of a college frat boy.  I found such comments to be completely out of line with the Pride and Prejudice film.  This film was the best edition of Pride and Prejudice ever made - unfortunately, this set does not match the quality of the film contained in it.  Mind you, if you don't already own it, and you like the look of the green box and the booklet that comes with it, which is very informative and interesting, then this set would be enjoyable.  Otherwise, I would suggest purchasing the $20 two disc set.  This \\"special edition\\" needs to be improved to truly be a special edition.
6305076995|3.0|I give this DVD 3 stars, VERY reluctantly.  The selection of songs on this DVD is awesome.  Every song a true classic.  The awesome talent of all the players is mind boggling (to an amateur musician).  The quality of this DVD, however, strips a couple stars off the rating. <br /> <br />I'm not sure why the movie didn't have half the songs the album did, or why the songs aren't in the same sequence on both.  I was hoping to get the remastered CD to play along with the movie, because the sound quality on this DVD is absolute garbage.  I don't know what sort of magical systems some of these other reviewers have that make it sound so good, but on my Pioneer surround sound system it sounds like, well...garbage.  I can forgive the video quality being grainy, since the film is more than 30 years old.  But with the phenomenal improvements in sound reproduction, such as digital remastering, I see no reason for this DVD to sound so bad.  I watched it twice, the second time to see if I could fiddle with the settings on the surround sound system, but no such luck.  After that I took if off my DVD shelf and hid it in a drawer, somewhere, in another room, so nobody would know I have it...
B000GG4KTU|5.0|What can you say?  Not only a great singer but a very fine jazz pianist in the vein of Nat Cole.
034544678X|5.0|This is perhaps the best book we have found on dog behaviour. It is a discursive book and takes time to digest, in fact it takes many readings and lots of dipping to absorb the profound insights it contains. McConnell's writing style is warm, compassionate and funny but underpinned by her scientific training and background. The 'science' is perfectly balanced by anecdotes, case studies and by her stories of her own pack. Highly recommended to all dog owners.
B000G759LW|5.0|Christina Aguilera is underrated for her talent.  This girl can sing!  I love this CD as it has so many styles and tempos.  I enjoy almost every song on the CD, which you know is usually impossible!
B0000025FG|4.0|I remember purchasing this Album back in 1977 when i was a 10th grader in high school. this Album has good relaxing tunes to assure to smooth the soul and sprit. i still have the LP in mint condition. must have if you like Jeff Lynn and his band memeber.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Thanks a lot Fox Network for screwing up Firefly on TV. Who knows what might have happened if you showed the episodes in the right order, and gave people a chance to love it? *sigh* At least we got  14 episodes to set the framework for the movie Serenity. If you haven't seen FireFly set, you should watch all 14 episodes before you watch Serenity. - Too bad this series didn't get a fair chance, it might have taken off. The characters are lovable, the dialog is brilliant, and the rest just works. Joss Whedon's vision is unique, and beautiful. Serenity and Firefly are part western, part sci-fi and a must-see if you enjoy either genre.
B000GBEWHA|5.0|I loved it when I was a teenager and now my son is a teenager and loves it too.  It is a story that all teens and grownups alike can understand and relate to.  It brings back memories of high school life and fun we had as teens.
B00006RG9K|3.0|Great show with a great line up but....the sound is terrible.  Go out and get Live at Wembley.  It's too bad it sounds bad because it has a better line up than Wembley.  Listen to them both in DTS if possible and you will hear the difference.  Overall excellent band with a bad DVD sound mix.
B000G8NY4U|5.0|First class service from Amazon. Yann's music is always fantastatic and this cd is truley worth buying.
B000J10ERO|2.0|One word: horrible. And it looks like we can blame Marlon Brando for being stupid enough to ask for $100 million to make a 2-minute cameo the first time around, radiating enough star power to have that bid accepted and then dying, and Christopher Reeve for doing so well in tryouts, then turning himself into a real-life hero and subsequently dying. And then we can blame everyone else; and finally, we can blame ourselves.<br /><br />You could just as easily call this piggybacker \\"Love Song for A Stem Cell.\\" The scenes in which our Superman of the moment looks down on the world while soaring high above as if he were a buff, brightly, tightly garbed Jesus -- all doe-eyed and doctored with digital touchups -- are mind-numbingly wretched. And I find shameful the decision to basically remake the first Reeve movie by a director whose time would have been better spent conjuring up a less-cluttered third X-Men movie (than hack Brett Ratner).<br /><br />There is something perverse about this desire in a large percentage of people for a daredevil protector who entertains the masses (you remember at least two occassions in which Superman receives applause in this installment) whether he stops a runaway train or gets run over by said train while injected with kryptonite. It's like some pale imitation of civilization, in which interest and morality revolve around this young Greek god, and whatever did the citizenry of this wimpy, whiny planet do during the five years Mr. Underoos was off on his galactic road trip of self-discovery? Or did Lex Luthor hibernate for the duration of Superman's absence because our hero brings out his world domination side as the movie seems to imply?<br /><br />To reiterate a point made by another reviewer, for all the power Superman possesses, all he really does in this movie is lift heavy objects, so if you're into those guys who pull trailers with their teeth, you might enjoy this.
B00005JO9J|5.0|I bought both the 1st and Second season of Grey's Anatomy because I watched the reruns during the summer and every episode was great, do I bought the dvd to catch myself up on all the episodes.  They are all so much fun and awesome. I enjoy every episode.  The writers make the lives so compelling.  You will enjoy it too, the episodes are like how ER used to be.
B00005JKES|5.0|So... now that the second season is finally being released on DVD, the first season isn't available new anymore?  What's the deal with that?  Obviously I shouldn'tve waited to buy the first season, but getting the first season wasn't as big a priority when I knew I'd have to wait for the second.  I really hope they manufacture some more!
B00004XMTJ|3.0|Did not like musical/scene selection setup.  Other than that, the DVD had great clarity and focus.  As for the production itself, I thought it was superb.
0060730552|5.0|Where could Simpson go from here? Hardly almost kill himself again & write another! Well it could be worse, making a living being a guest speaker at business functions. His grain of wisdom seems to be that if you want to succeed, (or get out!)then you have to get in deeper.
0898705525|5.0|Although Chesterton humbly passes this book off as merely an answer to questions posed to him during his life, it is an incredible read. I have read some parts of it numerous times and the whole book more than once. This is one of those gems that you will read with a pen in hand, scribbling in notes and underlines like you were back in college again.

B00000FC5H|5.0|Bring back the old school music with soul.  Great songs and good memories.
B00005JNS0|5.0|Yes, \\"CARS\\" gets hyped. Yes, it's Disney-distributed. Yes, it's technically a \\"family\\" movie (cringe), but this movie has all the Pixar Animation Studios magic and covers automobile culture down to the lugnuts and wingnuts. Way funny for kids and NASCAR addicts and classic-car lovers. Great story/script, sophisticated dialogue, and voices from some of the best actors in the business. <br /> <br />Just like \\"Toy Story,\\" this Pixar masterpiece is a blast for both kids and old geezers (I actually owned a 1949 Mercury long ago) but also captures America's popular history, in this case our complex love-affair with highways and wheels. Note that all this is on top of some of the best digital-animation & artwork in the history of movies. Ka-chow! Put this one in your collection with Disney's \\"Fantasia,\\" Miyazaki's \\"Spirited Away,\\" and Zemeckis' \\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\\"
B00006CXSS|5.0|Item ordered was here quickly.  It was packaged as described.  I saved quite a bit of money on my purchase over the store prices.  Thanks
B00013F35I|4.0|Great fun! Like all Springsteen live performances, he puts everything into it and surely earns his pay. The music selection is great and the video coverage is complete enough that you really feel a part of the audience. <br />The audio is pretty good, but I find at high volume, which suits this type of music, the lyrics can seem muffled. However, the spirit of the performance is infectious and the lyrics less important. So, ramp it up and enjoy!
B000GBEWHA|5.0|Good movie. I have loved it since it first came out. Yhe leather jacket cover gives it even more appeal and makes it go right along with the movie itself.
0099460254|5.0|I picked up this book at the library--by accident--and glad that I did. Briefly, this is an excellent and informative read. If you've enjoyed reading Bill Bryson and Steven Pinker, as another reviewer suggested, you'll love this.  <br />  The Great Vowel Shift and other sweeping changes are examples often used to illustrate the evolution of the English language. One of the many very interesting points the author makes, is that these changes seem to be universal to all languages, and he gives good examples of this. <br />  The book is wonderfully cohesive, without the trivial \\"zingers\\"--such as the rumored \\"eskimos have umpteen words for snow\\"--that many popular books on language are fluffed with. It is sober, yet enjoyable and well written such that you will not want to put it down.
B0002DB0FO|4.0|So, this is a really good product...Great Show...though I have to admit that the sencond and third seasons are a little bit better I STILL LOVE THIS SHOW...YAY! <br /> <br />Amazon needs to put the other seasons up for sale...yay...
B000EHRVP6|3.0|something about hosel just gave me deja vu all over again.  man hunting man has been done so many times in so many capacities, that when the gore finally came around the bend it was neither shocking nor surprising. <br />the film itself gave so much foreshadowing and obvious oddities surrounding the disappearance of various characters it made the coming scenes easy to anticipate and added to my notion that all the characters were idiots.   <br />that said, it still held my attention and had overall good pacing.  you'll probably see the twist coming from a mile away, but it's a fairly frightening concept none-the-less. <br />personally, i am sick of horror films that are staged in one or two settings.  hostel tried to reach beyond, but came up short.   <br />a truly unique look at torture can be found in the film \\"audition\\" <br /> <br />
B00005LC1H|5.0|This is a first rate product at a very fair price.  I enjoyed watching it over and over again.  John Cleese is brilliant!
B000AYEL6U|4.0|First of all, forgive my mistakes, English is a foreign language for me. <br />I can recommend this item for people who enjoy other adaptations of English 19th century literature. It serves it's purpose of transporting us to another time through very succesful casting and direction as well as really good production values. It is a love story with a heavy socio-political background, very interesting in itself, if one has not been over-exposed to that part of English history before. It is a pleasure to watch. <br />Now, to the flaws. The character of John Thornton, the male lead, supposedly improves on better aquaintance, probably a notion from \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\" But in reality the movie is playing a trick on us. Thornton is behaving badly and is saying horrible things at the beginning, and there is really no reason for the female lead, Margaret Hale, or us, the viewers to have a good opinion of him. As the story progresses he starts saying noble things which supposedly motivate his behavieur. So the whole \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" thing does not apply really, because the character of Thornton at the begging and at he end of the movie is that of two different people. Since we were not shown his growth, there is nothing to account for that change and just makes no sense. Margaret has to overcome her prejudices towards the North, of which there are plenty, and this is beautifully shown in the movie. But why make her overcome a \\"prejudice\\" which is actually sound judgement? Were the authors afraid to show her in too negative a light at the beginning?   <br />As well, the whole conflict between masters and workers and the suggested resolution are presented in such a childish way, as to have been surely written by someone very well meaning, but possessing a limited understanding of human nature. I recommend the excellent satire from my own country, \\"The Promised Land\\", written by a Nobel Price winner Wladyslaw Reymont and directed by the Academy Award recipient director Andrzej Wajda, in which the rich and the poor are, more truly to the era, at each other's throats. I know that Poland and England were at different stages of industrialization in the 19th century, but I still recommend you to see Wajda's movie for comparison, and also to show you what is probably missing from \\"North and South.\\"

B0000TB01Y|5.0|I bought this CD after seeing Wicked in Chicago.  I listen to the music in my  car a lot.  It is a wonderful reminder to a fabulous show that my daughter and I saw together.  I enjoyed it so much that I bought it for my daughter also.

0684833395|5.0|The story focuses around Yossarian, a WWII officer stationed in the Meditaranian Sea. Everyone thinks that Yossarian is insane because he is paranoid about dying. As Heller shows though, this is the very thing that makes him sane. <br /> <br />Quite simply, one of the best books ever written.
B00005JPGM|4.0|Leonardo DiCaprio has never been better. After The Aviator I came around to him. And though The Departed has sparked much praise, he here is able to evolve into a complex character and carry a film. He's the best part of this.   Edward Zwick makes me consider Ron Howard. Both are major studio directors, produce large films with A-list actors, play into popcorn cliches with precision and get credit for being able to handle drama and history as entertainment.   When something is going to happen in a film like Blood Diamond, I prefer to not be directed to my feelings. That's projecting, and it aggrivates me and draws be out of my previously sustained sense of willing disbelief. That happens much here.   I appreciate Zwick's intelligent handling of culture clashing characters, and recognize their socio-political significance. Certainly Glory is a classic histor-dramatic-war-epic and features great acting. Courage Under Fire again presented war-time chaos against racial and sexual politics within a historical reality. The Siege was over-hyped, despite being somewhat precient and not executed with as deft a writing and acting hand as The Last Samurai or even Blood Diamond. (Bruce Willis may be responsible for that.) The Last Samurai was a terrific story and again presented a culture clash that faded into genuine respect, affection, and finally self-sacrifice.   What I struggle with as a film lover though is a lack of trust in complexity. Africa as a continent is a chaotic place. It's conflicts are consistently brutal to an insane rate, and it's history-be it slavery, imperialism, colonialism, religion, and/or racism (if you will)- are so common that they get publisized between the weather and sports on CNN.   Djimon Hounsou and Jennifer Connelly, as the semi-leads are good. I've liked them in many other films. Here they get short shrift. Hounsou's Solomon is too simple. Too foolish. Too unaware. Too myiopic. Connelly's Maddy, true-hearted journalist, is standard. Her beauty becomes distracting when her place in the story becomes truth and idealism.   DiCaprio takes the film to where it needs to go though in it's gritty scenes. Because the dramatically scored or politically preachy parts are superfluous. Two examples are the scene when he is walking down the alley way with Coetzee's right hand man, who has just ransaked his apartment, and after spending the night in the brush he threatens Solomon as he describes baboons. Was there music scored under those scenes to guide my subconscious? I don't remember. There was an intensity though, and that drew me in.    Blood Diamond works as a partial character study of a mercenary and the ravages of Africa's chaos. It also works as a history and present day (Darfur anyone?) lesson of the role commerce and the wider world plays in Africa's travails.   I recommend this, but with some reservations.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|I am very slow in buying new music because I get attached to old and proven favorites, so I didn't hear about this album until my daughter gave me this one for Christmas. She knew I liked MK and EH, both of whom are well represented in my music collection. On hearing this album the first time, it became an immediate favorite, it actually blew me away. Never before have I liked all the cuts on either of these artist's albums, but on this CD, I loved them all.  This joint effort is excellent. The MK/EH harmonies are tight, pleasing, even superlative. The words can be understood on hearing them, and they can be felt by anyone. I am recommending this album highly to my friends, and to you. It's a real keeper.
B0004Z33F0|3.0|Movie is great.  Movie showed up with a broken case and without the Ultimate Edition case sleeve that comes on the movie if you buy it in the store.  I would recomend this movie but buy it in a store and not from Amazon.

The track is clear, allows for the adult learner to connect to the stories instead of the \\"work\\" creating an easy way to retain information without note taking.

B000DWMN2S|5.0|great movie, although the watching ones should be bilingual to understand all nuances
B000J3OTSM|4.0|Ok, so this story kind of reminds me of the \\"Save the Last Dance\\" movie, but I actually like it a lot. The music is great, the dancing is great, and the story is different than the recycled \\"Dirty Dancing\\" storyline. Channing Tatum is great, I love his character. He is complex, yet believable as Tyler Gage. Plus, he's white. It's a more realistic look at the poverty of all races in America right now. Jenna Dewan is fun to watch, but her character Nora isn't as well developed as I would have liked. Overall, the movie had good movement, and a decent story, but it still a dance movie; It isn't always about the story, so there are holes in what you would like to see develop in the characters. My final point would be that it is a good movie for anybody, just not Oscar material :)
1401907725|5.0|Daily guidance from your angels oracle cards is the latest of Doreen Virtues oracle card sets. It is the companion deck of the book \\"Daily guidance from your angles\\", which is a book with uplifting thoughts and affirmations, one for each day of the year written by the same author. The book and the deck have a similar look: a beautiful magenta/plumb background with accents of gold. A very stunning color scheme.<br /><br />The cards have a very luxurious feel and the images chosen for each card are, as usual, beautiful. The guidance on the cards is a little different from Doreen's usual cards, as on each one there is not only a word, but two or three sentences of guidance. This is positive, as far as receiving detailed guidance is concerned, however does not make it the best deck for developing one's intuition, as the meaning of the cards is quite tightly defined. For more \\"intuitive\\" cards by the same author I would recommend the \\"Dolphins and Mermaids\\" cards or the \\"Healing with the Angels\\" cards.<br /><br />Overall, this is a stunning set of cards, which, if you are into collecting divinitation tools, should definitely be added to your stash. At the very least, it will add a little beauty to your life, and most likely, it will also help you to awaken more of the wonderful healing vibration of the angels within yourself and your home. Enjoy.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|Bob Dylan keeps raising the artistic bar with a remarkable series of recordings that add to his musical legacy. \\"Modern Times\\" (2006) is a brilliant mix of blues, folk and rockabilly fused with incisive social and personal commentary. Sparked by memorable tracks such as \\"Thunder on the Mountain,\\" \\"Beyond the Horizon\\" and \\"The Levee's Gonna Break,\\" Dylan's genius reasserts itself in bold new directions - leaving his contemporaries in the dust. A transcendent listening experience.
B000GCFO0I|5.0|What fascinated me is how much the story diverged from the video game while keeping the appearance of the game, including the camera angles.  The transitions to and from the \\"Dark\\" and \\"Ashen\\" Silent Hill are wonderful.  The moral values portrayed in the movie make this worth adding to anyone's permanent collection. <br /> <br />Just a word of advice: do not expect to learn anything relevant to the actual video game series.
055357342X|5.0|My struggle here will be trying to express things about book three of a series that I have not already said about book one or book two. It is very difficult for me to try to write my thoughts on the book without either saying things I have already said or tripping over my excitement for the series while trying to give you a down-to-earth recounting of the book.  <br /> <br />I can tell stories about me sitting up at night reading in bed and getting entirely too animated with my reactions to things Martin wrote...or I can compare it with the first two books of the series. When put that way, I think I'll opt for the latter.  <br /> <br />By starting, or continuing, the series through book 3 you will not be disappointed. Not on a grand scale anyway. (One thing about George Martin is that he is not afraid to kill off main characters. As with the first two books, in book 3 main characters die. If you were attached to one or more who is killed/dies then you may be disappointed on a smaller scale.) The series is not new to me anymore; I no longer have the honeymoon feeling with the books. Gone is the initial excitement from finding something I loved, but my devotion is renewed at the end of each book.  <br /> <br />The excitement in the series slowed somewhat in book 2, but not in book 3. A Storm of Swords is aptly named for the fast-paced action. There is a lot that happens, and you may find yourself (as I did) going back and forth trying to decide which is my favorite character. Sit tight, it is going to be a bumpy ride, but it will be a fun ride. With George R. R. Martin, I am consistently entertained.  <br /> <br />I guess it boils down to this: If you have read the first two books, I would imagine you were somewhat eager to read book 3, but do not want to be let down. Don't hesitate. Get your copy of book 3 today and start reading. I tried to pace myself through the first three, knowing that there are still unwritten books in the series, to spread out the amount of time between books more evenly. I have given up on that idea. Book 4 here I come! <br />
B000B7BRMM|5.0|this is a wonderful Christmas CD, now one of my favorites!
B0000DZEE3|5.0|I love to play this DVD when I'm excercising at home.   <br />It's a great high-energy concert with excellent <br />production values.  Any fan of the Chili Peppers <br />would want this!
B000GG4KTU|5.0|wonderful CD! bought it as a gift for my dad, he loved it!!!
0060527986|3.0|This book reads like a metaphorical instruction manual to life. Pretty interesting if you like Paulo's work.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|I purchased this CD for Christmas 2006 and it is the absolutely Whitney at her best. I hope her new release is as good as this one!

B000BW7QWW|5.0|If you have seen the Firefly TV series this is a great movie. Otherwise it is just a good movie.
B000024A70|5.0|<br />This album is the most popular in Rock, ever! They tried to pull it off the shelves but the cries were too loud. It is also re-mastered.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|If you love sci-fi and horror this show will grab ahold of you not let go.  Has all the chills, drama, and suspense anyone could want in a television show.  And in this DVD set, you don't have to worry about commercials or remembering what happened over the week while waiting for the next episode to air.
B00065MDSG|5.0|<br />What do you do when you are in a band that records one of the most classic albums of all time, quit them and join another band and record another one of the most classic albums of all time. Bill Bruford did that & here it is!
0307346609|5.0|The title of the book accurately explains exactly what this book is. In the aftermath of a fictional zombie war that ravaged the whole of the earth, those who survived are hunted down and interviewed by the narrator. taking place at interesting locales across the new face being rebuilt across the planet. There isn't very much direct zombie contact in this book, but you get a pretty accurate point of view from different people of all sorts of cultures and backgrounds as to what they probably would do in the event of a real worldwide zombie virus outbreak. Very well written and researched, Max Brooks far outdoes himself compared to his other zombie book, The Zombie Survival Guide.
B000GDH9AA|3.0|Not at all what I expected but then, I forgot Erics' 80's performances were pretty lame. Don't misunderstand me: I am a Clapton fan for life, beginning with my first encounter with Cream, it is just this was an unremarkable concert set.
B000BJS4TO|4.0|If you like the movie, you will love the soundtrack!!  It is awesome!
0805047905|5.0|This book has been a favorite of my four year old for years - and I never tire of reading it, either (which is always a good thing from a parent's perspective).  Some of my son's first words were colors, and I think this book played a role in that.  It has been well used and has only had to be taped in a few places (not bad for a hardcover book that has been carried around by a child for three years!).
B000E8NRR6|2.0|Every song has the same pacing. The melodies are non-existent. If you're looking for Aja or Gaucho-styled songs, they're not here. There's really nothing to recommend this disk. He sleep-walked through the whole thing.
B0001YRVN4|5.0|I'M SORRY, BUT I BOUGHT THIS AS A GIFT FOR MY SON FOR CHRISTMAS AND THEREFORE AM UNABLE TO GIVE YOU A REVIEW.
B00005MP58|4.0|Previous reviews were correct in stating that the color is somewhat washed out on this video.  However, it did not prevent me from fully enjoying this great classic. And, oh! Mr. Darcy. He'll live on in my mind as such a \\"hottie\\".
0321213351|4.0|I read this book shortly after reading Martin Fowler's Refactoring book. I find this book to be a great extension to Fowlers basic priciples. It requires you to have some knowledge about basic refactoring terminology and techniques, and you should also have at least skimmed through the Gang of Four patterns book. Where this book has it's force is in helping you to identify when to do what types of refactoring and when NOT to do certain refactorings. It has a nice list of smells and their appropriate refactorings <br />I would recommend this as a reference book to all programmers that appreciate the value a well applied pattern has.
0618680004|2.0|i suggest to readers to read the Bishop of Oxford's comments on this title and i wonder how a scientist can weigh his religious arguments on his school boy sentiments.
0201485672|5.0|Martin Fowler is the one that introduced Refactoring as a concept to the real world (after it had lived for a while amongst wild XPers). This book is THE reference book to have when it comes to refactoring your code to clean up for readability, improving maintainability and simplifying design. <br />This book is a must have for ALL programmers, regardless of mileage, technical platform or coding preferences.
0140177396|4.0|I thought this was worth the read, and loved the style. I was absorbed in the reading, and I thought the dialogue and characterizations were excellent. Great book!
0307237699|3.0|I'm really into current affairs and I read a lot of books about foriegn policy, domestic policy, and other topics. Looking to the '08 Presidential race I thought I would give this book a try. I haven't ever read a book by a politician, opting usually for experts on the subject, but I had heard how well written this book is, so I read. <br /> <br />It was well written, and I like Barack, but it's also kind of fluffy, and it doesn't bring anything new to the table. I get the feeling that Barack is a funny, sincere, and well-informed guy, but I was expecting more nuance and detail, rather than the \\"I love America and God\\" that this book seemed to preach. If you're into books written by politicians, you might like this one. If you want to learn about issues and be informed, I might read somewhere else.
0061191752|3.0|I thought this was another cook book. So I was a little disapointed when I got it but Gordon is not an uninteresting fellow so I read it anyway. It is neat to read about his experiences.
0440237688|4.0|This book is along the lines of 'This Perfect Day', '1984', 'Fahrenheit 451'. In the end there are many questions unanswered. Where/when are they? What was the plane in the beginning? What is the source of this 'giving power'? The ending is another question. It was an easy read (1 day) but being 40 far to easy. I would say it is for teens or younger.
B000FIMG68|5.0|It is the best losing time experience ever. I watched it constantly for few days, and after that I hooked all my friends to do the same. <br />All of us call you to do excatly the same thing, just lay down, forget real life for several days, get fired, who cares!!!
B00005RRHC|5.0|I cannot, for the life of me, understand why this film hasn't been released in region 1 DVD format. It's a fabulous film, and the perfect New Year's Eve movie. Both the script and the actors are superb. One might even call it the British Big Chill. Please, please, PLEASE release this on region 1 DVD, so those of us who don't live in Japan and Africa can watch this delightfully entertaining film.
B000GFLKEY|5.0|Can't beat the combo of Spike and Danzel.  Great film and acting.  A keeper!
B000H7JD4A|5.0|They just keep getting better and better. This is definitely one of those albums that you can listen to every song on it. Personal Favorite is \\"For The Greater Good of God\\".
0743298020|5.0|This book is engrossing and intriguing; I read it in one sitting. The mystery is well developed and the writing outstanding. If you have read \\"Jane Eyre\\" and \\"Wuthering Heights,\\" you will appreciate that this book has the same tone and similar themes. I can't wait for Setterfield's next book!
0066620996|4.0|Yeah, good book. It does offer a few things that you wouldn't expect to form the basis on which good companies become great ones.
7884064790|3.0|We bought a copy of this on ebay.  It would evidently be all right -- IF you had a VCR from Australia.  With U.S. systems, the English subtitles are unreadable.  The visuals are acceptable -- no worse than black-and-white on old TV -- but if you don't speak Japanese, all you can see are the pictures.  Of course, they are Kurosawa's pictures, and always worth a watch -- but one would like to know who those people are.  We sold our copy to a gentleman in England who did have a Pacific Rim VCR.  Yes, Virginia, there is a difference.
034544678X|4.0|I loved this book.  It's easy to read, full of great information and insight and amusing stories.  It really helped me figure out WHY my dog was doing some of the things he was doing and WHAT I could do to make it different for him. My ONLY complaint (with this and virtually all dog books) is that my dog is very small and some of the suggestions really need some modifying because of his size.  It would have been helpful to have some of these modifications suggested rather than having to come up with things on my own that would accomplish the same thing.
B000J103YI|1.0|Just saw the movie and although the performers gave their best the musical score really brings the whole project to cheeseville. The music has that late 70's early 80's Broadway pop sound that can only be tolerated with a lot of glitzy stage distractions. Not once even in the soulfully sung yet very ponderous \\"I'm telling you...\\" could you imagine this music being written and performed by black americans in the 1960's-70's. Unlike pop music which doesn't need to move a plot the songs here are drama ballad after drama ballad, really quite exhausting not inspiring.
B000BJ7BCK|5.0|I'm a 27-year-old who appreciates a good, clean movie. This movie has great characters, a fun story and nothing to feel bad about showing to kids, with the exception of some super-hero-like violence (not too bad), and a bit of kissing (not more than your average Disney flick). It is well done overall and leaves a feeling of pleased satisfaction. I loved this movie. Even my husband enjoyed it, and he is so picky he claims he doesn't like movies. Definitely one of my favorites.
B000J103PC|2.0|Streep is a genius. Tucci gives flesh to what could have been  a\\"Will & Grace\\" character, thanks Stanley. There are bosses out there in the corporate world that appear to be just insane but know what it takes to stay at the top. All this is handled well with the movie  however the personal lives of the young assistant and here boyfriend are just not interesting and rely on obvious plot devices to get them from point A to point B.
B000000OUJ|5.0|GZA A.K.A GENIUS SECOND ALBUM \\"LIQUID SWORDS\\" IS DEFINITELY A CLASSIC ALBUM AND ONE OF MY FAVORITE RAP ALBUMS OF ALL TIME. IN MY OPINION THIS ALBUM IS THE BEST RELEASE FROM THE WU TANG CLAN PERIOD BECAUSE WHAT SEPRERATES GENIUS FROM THE REST OF HIS GROUP MEMBERS IS HIS MIND STATE AND HOW HE DELIVERS ON EVERY TRACK WITH SCIENTIFIC RHYMES THAT WONT LET YOU DOWN I MEAN THIS GUY SPITS FIRE AND HE IS INDEED A GENIUS. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM TO ANYONE BECAUSE I PROMISE THAT IT WONT LET YOU DOWN.    MY TOP 5 SONGS ON THE ALBUM ARE:  1.COLD WORLD (FEAT. INSPECTAH DECK)-THE SONG'S TITLE IS SELF EXPLANATORY BECAUSE THE WORLD WE LIVE IN IS COLD AND GENIUS AND INSPECTAH DECK BOTH HAVE GREAT CONCEPTS TO THE SONG THE 2 BEST MEMBERS IN THE WU TANG CLAN SHINE BRIGHT ON THIS TRACK.  2.B.I.B.L.E.(BASIC INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE LEAVING EARTH)(FEAT. KILLAH PRIEST)-A GREAT CONCEPT TO THE SONG BECAUSE GENIUS IS EXPLAINING HOW LIFE CAN BE AS FAR AS PEOPLE TELLING YOU HOW YOU SHOULD LIVE YOUR LIFE AND WHAT TO BELIEVE IN AS FAR AS RELIGION. KILLAH PRIEST PUTS DOWN A NICE VERSE ALSO.  3.DUEL OF THE IRON MIC(FEAT.O.D.B.,MASTA KILLA, AND INSPECTAH DECK)-THIS SONG IS REALLY NICE FOR THE SIMPLE FACT THAT HOW GENIUS AND MASTA KILLA BOTH WERE USING SCIENTIFIC ELEMENTS IN THEIR RHYMES. O.D.B. DOES THE HOOK AND INSPECTAH DECK PUTS DOWN A NICE VERSE.  4.GOLD-GREAT METAPHOR ABOUT COMING UP IN THE STREETS WITH GREAT RHYMES \\"SNAKE GOT SMOKED ON THE SET LIKE BRANDON LEE/BLOWN OUT THE FRAME LIKE PAN AM FLIGHT 103\\".  5.SHADOWBOXIN(FEAT. METHOD MAN)-VERY NICE RHYMES FORM BOTH GENIUS AND THE METHOD MAN. RHYME I REALLY LIKE FROM GENIUS ON THIS SONG IS \\"WE REIGN ALL YEAR ROUND FROM JUNE TO JUNE/N****Z BITE IMMEDIATELY IF NOT SOON\\".    I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM TO ANYONE WHO IS A FAN OF TRUE RAP BECAUSE I CANT STOP LISTENING TO IT AND I GUARANTEE THAT YOU WONT STOP LISTENING TO IT EITHER!!!.
B000GG4KTU|5.0|I love the music she produces. The phrasing the tone.  Just love how she  <br />makes everything so jazzy.  She is wonderful both as a musician and a lyricist.
B000002VSN|5.0|Whitney Houston at her \\"Best\\" I Love this album. I listen to this CD in my home,I also listen at it in my car. It is Fantastic! I highly recomend <br />this CD. If you love gospel music,grab it! I sing the songs in my head day and night even when the music is not on. I Love anything from Whitney!
1400079179|2.0|The book is written well, however, the story has no truth to it.<br /><br />In my book of the bible it is written different. I hope the author will some day find the truth about Jesus, who is not at all, what he writes about. He is not just someone that has a fling with some woman. He is the Savior of mankind and the son of God.
B000035Z1Z|5.0|Total chick-flick...I love this movie!! Kevin Kline is such a good stero-typical Frenchman and Meg Ryan is...well...so Meg Ryan! It is heartwarming and funny and has a GREAT chick-flick ending! I am not one to watch a movie more than once, but I own this and enjoy watching it again and again!
B000IJ79WU|5.0|Ladies and Gentlemen, <br /> <br />This is the epic Superman sequel that should have been brought to the world's audience.   <br /> <br />Richard Donner's edition of Superman II has some very distinct differences from Richard Lester, and I can assure you that they make the film so much better. <br /> <br />For instance, if you admire Marlon Brando in the role as Superman's father, then you will really enjoy this special edition from Richard Donner.  Brando's fatherly advice is something that we can all benefit from, and I really enjoyed the scene when he gives Superman his Kryptonian abilities back.  It was simply the best scene in the movie!!! <br /> <br />Lex Luthor and Otis share their uneven conversations to much delight, and Otis even has a bit more screen time in this edition with Luthor. <br /> <br />Lois Lane also has a much better role in Donner's edition.  From square one, we see her as a very sharp (and gorgeous) young lady (in beautiful restoration footage) who has already figured out that Clark Kent is Superman!  For example, she plays a very intelligent trick on Clark Kent to find out if he is Superman or not.  And yes, that cheesy jump into Niagra Falls has been removed from the movie!  In its place is a much more clever, intimate (and potentially dangerous) attempt to find out who Clark Kent really is. <br /> <br />The Three Supervillains!!!!  Soooooooo much more depth to them in this edition!  We hear Brando's voice from the past describe their heinous attempts to overthrow Krypton's elected officials (plug for democracy over tyranny), and we even hear a bit about how Brando is a humanitarian who believed in reforming these criminals into productive citizens.  When this rather kind act failed, he had no choice but to imprison and banish them into oblivion. <br /> <br />Lastly, a trivia note worth mentioning is that off-camera loyalty runs deep in the Superman movies.  Did you know that when the Salkinds fired Donner, Mr. Hackman REFUSED to come backto the studio!!!!  BRAVO, Mr. Hackman!!!  Your loyalty is something we can all learn from! <br /> <br />So, to sum this up: <br /> <br />More Jor-El advice and compassion, more Lex and Otis humor, more Lois Lane wit and more Superman smiles in remastered digital picture!!! <br /> <br />Absolutely Superb!!!!!!!!!!
032147404X|4.0|Offers a lot of great tips. Easy to understand. <br />Humor was a little too much but nothing but great information.
B000GG4KTU|4.0|Don't get me wrong, it's hard for her to do much wrong with that creamy smooth voice, superb piano skills, and some wonderful big band thrown in, but if you liked her older work that was mainly up-tempo, you may find too many soothing.....ZZZZZZ....sorry I dozed off tunes.<br /><br />Out of 11 tracks, four of them (4, 5, 8, and kinda 11) are great toe-tappin' songs.  The rest are good but are usually too sleepy for me.  Production on the whole disk is without flaw and I would buy it again, but I have not added many tracks to my iPod.
B0008GNJZY|5.0|Excellent movie that can also be used as a learning tool for managers and supervisors.  Shows how one can turn around a broken system.  Great acting, a really good movie.
B000683VI4|5.0|I am not one typically for time pieces and this one surpassed and time line..it is a truely timeless love story that would inmpact anyone who would watch it.  Amazing.
071563318X|4.0|Zombie invasion?  Not a problem now.  I've been sharpening the landscaping tools in preperation.
B00005JO9J|5.0|great way to see how it all started and who can resisit the chemistry between Meredith and mc dreamy
B000F0UV0E|5.0|Rarely do albums of duets catch me. This one sure has. Mark's vocals and guitar are a perfect match for Emilou's voice. They influence each other in a way that rarely happens in music. Mark's style is very laid back and captivating. Emilou's sincerity makes you think that the pair have known each other for a very long time. Each other's sensibilities are highlighted by the other. Alone each are great,together they are magic. <br /> This CD is mature and playful, strong and sensible it is Mark and Emilou.
B0001AVZA8|4.0|refreshing look at love in the later years, cute and energetic.  Good chemistry between jack nicholson and diane keaton.
B000FIMG68|5.0|This was every bit as good as season one and I can't wait to see the third season.
B000G03Q2S|5.0|Pet Sounds is the ultimate aural experience. I enjoyed the 5.1 Surround mix. I sat in a chair, closed my eyes and drifted into a soundscape of textured notes and voices.  <br /> <br />I already own the box set, the 1st CD edition and even an original vinyl copy. It seems that every time I upgrade I am never disappointed.  <br /> <br />Purist seem to like the Mono version of the album. I love the all the sounds that scream out of the stereo version.  <br /> <br />If you do not have the box set or the other stereo Cd, I would highly recommend this set. It covers everything Pet Sounds that you will want. If you do not care for the interviews and film, you will appreciate the surround mix on the DVD. The box set is more for Brian wilson Fanatics(Myself included) and collectors.
6305428298|5.0|There's never been a film quite like this. Brenda Blethyn is at her boozy best as the screaming mother of \\"Little Voice.\\" Ewan McGregor delivers a very subtle, warm performance as a guy who finds comfort only with his homing pigeons until he meets \\"Little Voice.\\" Michael Caine plays the loud jerk so well, but you still feel for his character as the agent searching for the career making client. Jane Horrocks is a wonder as \\"Little Voice\\", the girl who barely whispers, but who comes alive belting out tunes made famous by Judy Garland, Marilyn Monroe, Shirley Bassey and others. Viewers should know that Horrocks does all her own singing, she's not lip synching. They note this at the end of the film, but I think viewers will be astounded knowing it as they watch her amazing renditions.
B0002O7XWC|5.0|If you a motorcyclist and haven't seen this classic film yet, what are you waiting for?  <br />\\"We blew it Billy\\".
0060832819|3.0|I have read numerous books by Coelho. I kept reading his books because I loved them. However, Zahir is the only book (so far) by this authors I didn't enjoy. I expected the same emotional depth, search for oneself etc which are the hallmark of his books. Here the narrator appears as rather annoying/egocentric/shallow/superego character to which I had no sympathy. Plus, Coelho's style of writing seems to become much commercialized, and so different from the past; it is too arrogant at times. Overall I was disappointed.    <br />  <br />
B000HBKCDC|5.0|I'm not a McLachlan fan, and bought the CD on a whim. The individual songs are wonderful, some with creative arrangements of classic melodies. But the beauty isn't in the parts; it's in CD as a whole. She draws delicate emotions and melancholy across the selections. The CD is like a pastel tapestry, perfect for headphones on a cold, snowy night.
B000GIXIBY|2.0|Army of Darkness is a great film but this the worst HD disc I own. The film doesn't look very good in HD at all. It is very grainy. The sound is decent at best and there are NO extras on the disc. It's not worth your time and money at this point. If it ever drops in price maybe but right now I reccomend you purchase the two disc Boomstick DVD edition if you want this film.
B00004RF8J|5.0|To make it into my DVD collection a DVD must have repeatability!  I have seen this movie so many times and it is truly a classic and a must have for one's collection.  Rick Moranis is superb in this and I love the broadway feel it has with the break out of say a \\"shup shup\\" from the singers who appear on the scene.  It is just funny on top of funny!  FEED ME!
B000E1MTYU|4.0|I went in very skeptical when I first saw Terminator 3. Overall I think it is one of the best action films in the past 10 years or so and a very good edition to the Terminator series. In HD it looks and sounds awesome as can be. The extras are not in HD which is a let down. That is really the only bad thing I can say about this disc. If you like Arnold or Ternimator I highly reccomend this. I wish Terminator 1 and 2 were on HD DVD but they sadly are only on Blu-ray.
B000EDWKXI|4.0|I rented this movie and was surprised at how much I liked it.  Heath Ledger is a great actor and gives a great performance in Cassnova.  And I must not forget an unforgettable and superb performance by Oliver Platt.  This was well written, well directed, and highly entertaining!  It moves at a great pace so you must get onboard from the beginning.  There was no lag and no drifting off as the movie was totally engaging. I knew I must have it for my collection!!
B00008D1NF|5.0|The disc was solid. Each track was different and the cd flowed well, was well organized etc. I first heard of the tribalistas when I was living in Cabo Verde and when I came back to Canada it was the first cd I bought- they're a great brazilian group and their tracks have become classics worldwide. Foi otimo!
0786860707|5.0|Every animator, wannabe animator, or animation fan should own this book.  This book could be (and probably is) its own college-level course of \\"how to\\" animate. <br /> <br />This also makes a great coffee table book for the casual animation fan. <br /> <br />I also recommend \\"The Animator's Survival Guide\\" by Richard Williams.
1932100660|5.0|As a result of my husband's reading of this book, we have become vegan for the past year.  Warning! A life changing experience.  We can never go back to not-knowing.
B000BB1MIC|5.0|If you are a fan of Gilmore Girls (and who isn't??) you will LOVE Season 5.  It is without a doubt the best written season to date.  So much happens with the characters that we fans have come to love- and speaking of love, Luke & Lorelai FINALLY admit to it!  Great from the first episode to the end.  The only disappointment (and it's a slight one) is that it doesn't contain the leaflet of \\"Gilmorisms\\"- you have to go to a website to get it.  Other than that, definitely a must-have for any GG fan!!!
B000GFLAI0|2.0|Of his last three albums (which for some reason have been labelled a trilogy) this is by far the weakest.  The other two are great. <br /> <br />This is a bunch of blues songs and a few cowboy swing.  \ <br />All kind of listless.
0803730098|5.0|A great follow up to one of our favourite books, The Gruffalo. Although, I think, To truly appreciate this book you need to have at least read The Gruffalo once or twice. My daughter loved it so much when we borrowed it from the library, she asked me to buy it (not something my six year old usually does!). Now we can read it whenever we want.
0792843584|4.0|Heaven's Gate (Michael Cimino, 1980)<br /><br />I have a working hypothesis that the more the general public hates a movie-- truly, in its collective heart of hearts, despises it-- the less that movie deserves it. After all, the general public's lack of filmgoing taste is supremely well-documented; the Lifetime Movie Network is a major advertising draw these days, and somehow Joel Schumacher continues to get work, despite not having made a watchable movie since 1990 or so. (And, well, two words: Warren Beatty.) The most recent movie with which I put this hypothesis to the test was Michael Cimino's universally loathed Heaven's Gate, widely known as \\"that incoherent western that bankrupted United Artists.\\" And, once again, the hypothesis gets a bit of weight added to it; while Cimino's film is, in places, incoherent, and did, in fact, send United Artists into the toilet, it's a fine-looking little epic that has a lot more going for it than most of what's passed for \\"action films\\" in the quarter-century since its release.<br /><br />Heaven's Gate is Cimino's retelling of the Johnson County War, a particularly galling event in American history. We see it from multiple points of view, but the center of all the tales is James Averill (Kris Kristofferson). We see him first graduating from Harvard with his friend Billy Irvine (John Hurt), in an extended scene cut from the theatrical release, then cut to fifteen years later, when the two find themselves on opposite sides of the burgeoning conflict in Wyoming-- Irvine as a member of the landowner's association, backed up by the President, who desire the removal of hundreds of immigrants from the frontier, and Averill living amongst them, a previous member of the Landowner's Association who's been removed from his position and now wishes simply to live in obscurity, if relative wealth, among his community.<br /><br />It's a long movie, there's no doubt about it, and one wonders, having seen the three-and-a-half hour version and knowing there's a version that's two hours longer in a vault somewhere, how much of the movie's current incoherence (which must have been far worse in the two-hour theatrical release) would be eliminated by seeing the full version of the film. Hollywood seems to have a big problem with movies that go over two hours, despite having seen over and over that big epics can do amazingly well at the box office (The Longest Day was, of course, longer than the directors' cut of Heaven's Gate, and Dances with Wolves wasn't much shorter). So we end up with, well, incoherent westerns that bankrupt United Artists. Doesn't that kind of gall you? After all, this is Hollywood saying that you don't have the attention span to watch an intelligent, complex film that's longer than two hours. (But watching Kevin Costner run around in the woods for four hours, it seems, is vacuous enough to get past everyone.) And I'm here to tell you that Heaven's Gate is an intelligent, complex film, one that's well worth watching, even in this abbreviated three-and-a-half hour form. Cimino's obsessive attention to detail pays off very handsomely; this is a spectacular-looking film. The cinematography is almost Australian in its ability. The characters are rich and complex, and fit well into the relatively simple plot. The only thing required of the viewer is the attention span. ****ion and knowing there's a version that's two hours longer in a vault somewhere, how much of the movie's current incoherence (which must have been far worse in the two-hour theatrical release) would be eliminated by seeing the full version of the film.

6305508550|4.0|I believe this movie started off as a 2 minute cartoon skit on Saturday Night Live, but that can't compare to the laughs that this movie will bring you.  You'll want to get this movie, believe me...  But instead of getting this movie, you may want to consider getting the limited edition collecters disc as it's loaded with extras!!
B000AP04L0|3.0|Office Space (Mike Judge, 1999)<br /><br />It has seemed that over the years since this relatively obscure little movie came out, it's enjoyed a growing popularity simply on word of mouth. Pretty much everyone I know makes multiple references to it in just about every work-related conversation I've had. One it started showing up in commercials, I figured it was time to get around to seeing it. And while I didn't think it was awful, I have to wonder what those who say \\"if you've worked in this environment, you'll think this is the funniest movie ever\\" were smoking when they saw it. It's mildly amusing, but nothing special.<br /><br />In case you've been living under a rock for seven years, the plot: Peter Gibbons (Standoff's Ron Livingston), a drone at a large corporation, is just living day to day, doing nothing but working, obsessed with Joanna (Jennifer Aniston), a waitress at the local sports bar, with his only social interaction outside the workplace being with his somewhat psychotic neighbor Lawrence (well-known voice actor Diedrich Bader) when they talk through the thin walls of their condos. The company brings in a pair of efficiency experts, Bob (John C. McGinley) and Bob (Paul Wilson), and something snaps; Gibbons decides to simply neglect his job. Needless to say, the second he does this, his supervisor, Bill (Gary Cole) calls for his head, and the efficiency experts decide he needs to be promoted to upper management. And things just get weirder from there.<br /><br />It's not a bad film, really-- I just don't think it lives up to the incredible hype that it's now almost impossible to see this movie without experiencing. You will likely be told that it's the best thing since sliced bread, and that if you don't find it the funniest movie you've ever seen, you just don't get it. Not true. Remember, Mike Judge is the guy behind Beavis and Butt-Head and King of the Hill; if you were never a fan, this probably isn't going to change your mind. Still, it is true that if you work in an office environment, you'll either identify with or recognize a lot of these people, and that goes a long way towards redeeming some of the jokes that don't quite cut it. ** ½true that if you work in an office environment, you'll either identify with or recognize a lot of these people, and that goes a long way towards redeeming some of the jokes that don't quite cut it. ** ½
0783225547|4.0|If you liked movies like Twister, the Day After Tomorrow, and Volcano, you'll love this.  Not as action packed as \\"Volcano\\" was, but in my opinion a better movie as it is a bit more scientific, and holds more of a realistic plot.  Great movie and I highly recommend.
B000089770|4.0|Smoke (Wayne Wang, 1995)<br /><br />Wayne Wang has had a kind of up-and-down career over the years, but Smoke is definitely one of his up moments. Not to say there couldn't have been some things done better here, but Wang takes Paul Auster's script and a fantastic stable of actors and just lets them loose. By all reports, Auster's script ended up taking quite a beating at the hands of the actors-- how much of the movie's dialogue is improvised has been a hotly-debated topic for years, but even the most conservative figures are pretty high-- but the end result is worthwhile.<br /><br />The movie focuses around Auggie Wren (Harvey Keitel), the owner of a cigar store, and his customer/friend Paul Benjamin (William Hurt), a writer trying to overcome the recent death of his wife. In the main storyline, into their lives steps Rashid Cole (Lost's Harold Perrineau), a kid on the run from a couple of gangsters. The movie then spins off onto tangents involving Rashid, Paul, and Auggie separately-- Rashid finds out his father (Forest Whitaker) is alive and living outside the city, Auggie's ex-girlfriend Ruby (Stockard Channing) shows up to tell him he's got an eighteen-year-old daughter, Paul; of course, is still dealing with his wife, and the resulting writers' block.<br /><br />With all that Wang tries to fit into a surprisingly short movie, some of the plotlines get short shrift. Especially puzzling is the minuscule amount of screen time given Ashley Judd, who plays Auggie's daughter; their brief conversation opens a lot of doors into a lot of different places this movie (or a sequel) could have gone, and there's no follow-up. But still, what's here is grand, and well worth watching. *** ½
B00004RFFI|1.0|I saw this movie in the theater twice...  I saw it many many more times now that I have it on DVD.  The special effects are incredible, and it has an overall more than excellent plot.
B000FIMG68|5.0|The series is very entertaining and I believe most people reading this know the story. Therefore, I will focus more on the DVD set itself. This is a remarkably beautiful DVD set, made with love. Each DVD out of the seven has a different print, showing motives related to the episodes on the respective DVD. It also contains a booklet, giving you a short overview of each episode. The seventh DVD contains very interesting 'making ofs' and other very interesting information about the series, introduced by another 'Orientation' movie, produced only for this DVD :-). The picture quality is HDTV - like and 5.1 surround sound is also very good, however not as good as for a feature film. <br />I can highly recommend this DVD set and it is really worth the money you pay for it.

0446677450|5.0|I am going through some career and life transitions and this book was recommended to me as being good for that.  It is.  In a sense, there's nothing in the book which isn't \\"common sense\\", but most of us get so caught up in day-to-day existence that we forget \\"common sense\\".  The message of this book is that most of us try to just follow the rules and work hard - and we wind up working for others and being poor.  The book challenges us to be creative, take calculated risks, and create our own income and employment - and raise our potentials dramatically.  Particularly in this economy where things are changing and the middle class is disappearing - where \\"following the rules\\" is a prescription for being an underpaid cog in someone else's wheel - the message is important.  It is still very difficult to make the major changes in behavior - and the book doesn't really give specifics on \\"how to\\" - since the whole point is that there isn't \\"a formula\\" which works, but it is an important \\"kick in the head\\" to make us examine our lives and the choices we have made - either intentionally or by default - and to ask ourselves how we could do things in a more beneficial way.  It's an easy read.  You owe it to yourself to read it.

Being a rabid Beatle fan, and becoming of age when they hit the scene, I know every song, word and note of their music. They must have had a blast working on this project. This is NOT a \\"best of\\" by any means. This is a work by the man who was there and knows where the bodies are buried within the original tapes. Even if you aren't that familiar with the Beatles, this is the one CD you should have in your collection.

B000FP2OPY|5.0|The first season of Supernatural shows, episode by episode, the evolution of a show that is going from good to great as we speak.  Over the course of the season the show gets deeper, darker, and more suspenseful.  The relationships and characters grow more complicated.  In fact, it is the relationship between the members of the Winchester family (a broken and formerly estranged family that hunts the supernatural, torn apart and brought back together by tragedy) that is the heart of the show more than just the scare of the admittedly well-researched monsters of the week.  What at first seemed to me like just The X-Files with 20 something brothers grows into it's own during the course of this season and by the dramatic final episodes of the season stands on its own as something truly unique and well-crafted.  The banter between the brothers provides the comedy relief needed to keep the darkness balanced. The acting by guest characters (including \\"Darla\\" and \\"Fred\\" from Angel) is quite good as is the recurring character of the father John Winchester (Jeffrey Dean Morgan).  But the true stand out of the show is the surprisingly and refreshingly (for the WB/CW) excellent acting of Jensen Ackles who plays Dean Winchester.  The underlying vulnerability of this tainted-warrior-with-a-heart-of-gold character is palpable.  By midway through the season, it is clear that his acting has made the Dean character the heart of the show and that this is an actor whose career is just beginning.  I went from skeptical to a fan with this dvd.  I think you will enjoy.

B000006TRV|5.0|It's really hard to call any album Floyd's best, but this one may be my personal favorite. Some complain about it being so over-the-top and/or pretentious, but in reality, these aspects really serve to increase its brilliance rather than detract from it. It is a unique album, even by Floyd's standards. MOst groups could not pull of such an ambitious project, but Floyd makes it work and then some. Waters's theatrical vocals and lyrics are ideal for the album and have become classic; he is in top form on this dark masterpiece. One of the greatest guitar players ever, Gilmour had wowed us all on previous albums... but this is the one where he really out does himself. The Wall is a contender for best guitar album ever... really! Every Gilmour lick, riff, and solo is classic and sublime. Any guitar player that doesn't have this album needs it. Gilmour is just on another plane on this one.
B000GIXEIG|5.0|This movie is very exciting and beautiful.  Gerard Butler is excellent as Beowulf, it's a movie to be seen over and over again.  Gerard Butler is one of the great new talents on the screen today.  I would recommend this movie to anyone.

0380977788|5.0|Coraline is the story of a young girl named Coraline (frequently called Caroline by the neighbors) who is unhappy with her life, her parents, and the world that surrounds her. One day she stumbles into an alternate existence which is eerily like her own, only her parents have buttons for eyes, hundreds of rats make up a man in a trench coat, and many other surprises lay in store. <br /> <br />Coraline is an excellent book for children (may be a little scary for young children) and equally as good for adults. This book is haunting and charming at the same time as Neil's books always are. Dave McKean's illustrations are beautiful as usual and add plenty to the atmosphere of the story. <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor and pick up this book. You won't be disappointed. FYI...this book is about to be made into a movie which I'm sure will be equally as good.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I watched this series with my husband, and I definitely recommend it to anyone wishing to add to their DVD collection.  I especially love the interviews with the real WWII veterans before each episode, as they serve as constant reminders that what you're watching is the real thing.  There is plenty of action and intensity for guys, as well as an abundance of heroism and emotion for the girls. <br /> <br />I will say that the graphic nature of the violence in this series resembles that of Braveheart, Saving Private Ryan, etc.  Parents with small children should wait until after bedtime to watch.
B000H305U0|5.0|It took a while for this cd to grow on me because I was thinking to myself that it would be hard for Justin to beat 'Justified'...however, after hearing the majority of the songs a couple of times, I found myself singing right along and absolutely loving this cd.  Even after having it for a few months now, I will put it into my cd player to listen to 1 or 2 songs and end up listening to the whole thing...repeatedly!  Definitely some good music.  Justin and Timbaland obviously have fantastic chemistry...with hopefully more to come in the future.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|Pretty much any work produced by Joss Whedon at this point deserves a look.  Most of what he puts his name on is worth watching.  \\"Serenity\\" was an excellent last episode too a series that ended years before its time.
1416524800|3.0|I finally figured out what's wrong with the Dan Brown's novels. They all follow a formula. In all of them Dan Brown builds up on an interesting idea and then believes that if a villain is the most unlikely character then the novel will be very satisfying. Actually, no, Mr. Brown! That is not the case at all. Sometimes it is better to stick with the obvious. Something else bothered me in this particular novel: Dan Brown constantly kept refering to some historical facts (like Clinton and Lewinsky scandal). And what for? The novel would be just fine without these little reminders.<br /><br />This effort deserves 3 stars because it is a page-turner. However, right after I found out who was behind all of the conspiracies, I immediatelly lost any interest (for the reason I stated above) and just skimmed through the rest of the novel just to see how it ends. What was even more dissappointing is that the character responsible for all the mess in the novel had a VERY WEAK reason to go as far as he did (Ok a little spoiler here... it's a he!). If it was anyone else (as Dan Brown wanted us to believe) I would liked it better. Also, I think he got carried away a bit toward the end with too much action.<br /><br />So, overall, it is an ok read, but that's all it is.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|I saw this movie the other night. It is a fantastic film.<br /><br />The cinematography is wonderful, the script is almost perfect. The music fits flawlessly in every scene.<br /><br />Now, to those of you dissapointed that you figured out the ending before the film was over. Stop basing your review on that. It's rediculous. It's the year 2007...and you are sore because films don't shock you?<br /><br />Pathetic. I can guarantee to all of you, people who have seen this movie, and to those who havn't. If you guessed, or guess what happens in the end...you won't have a clue as to how it's done.<br /><br />The reason why this movie is so great, and why i'm upset with the negative reviews because people wern't suprised.<br /><br />Is because this movie is about illusions. as most of you know, or believe, magic is not real. Magic is simply an illusion, a series of actions to make your eyes trick you into seeing something that isn't there. Or not seeing something that is.<br /><br />When someone does a magic trick, let's say the most famous card trick.<br /><br />You pick a card, put it back into the deck.<br /><br />Now, we all know what happens next. The magician guesses or knows your card.<br /><br />It is rarely ever the trick it self that enchants us, but wondering how the trick is done.<br /><br />That is stressed over and over in this movie.<br /><br />which is why it is more clever than some of these \\"critics\\" may lead you to believe<br /><br />The purpose of the movie isn't to shock you with an illusion that you've never seen or don't expect. The purpose of the movie is to leave you wondering how it is done, and than leave you saying..\\"it's so simple\\" when you find out how it is done.<br /><br />frankly, all of you who say you wern't suprised need to step off your high horse, and realize that you were ment to get it. You were ment to know what happens in the end. None of you were ment to know how it happened though, and none of you did. And if you were completely suprised....well, some people are more average than others i guess.<br /><br />Enjoy, don't let idiotic critics turn you away from this magical film.ll, some people are more average than others i guess. <br /> <br />Enjoy, don't let idiotic critics turn you away from this magical film.
9707704667|4.0|I have not read Mario Vargas Llosa's stuff in a long time due to personal reasons related to his superficial political attitudes and comments in general with respect to the Peruvian governments, I just did not felt like reading his books for a while. I did read his essay on Flora Tristan and Gauguin last year to satisfy my curiosity, I found it dense, anyway I did receive this book as a gift from a Lady from Miraflores (the place where the story starts) just about five days ago and I thought great just when I was thinking that I should read something from a Peruvian writer, I gave it a shot and left the book that I was reading before (a Biography) and wow I just had a blast, l just could not live the book, somehow even though I was busy with lunches and dinners due to the festivities of year end I managed to read and finish the book. <br /> <br />We can analyze and disect the book in many ways and be technical about it, but at the end of the day I had a great time reading it, it was none stop fun, I am from Miraflores also and can relate to certain feelings on the ambiance, as well as with Paris and London where I travel for Business , but mostly about women that I have met in my Life that to a degree act or acted like the ninia mala in diffrent ways and levels of course, the ninia mala of the book is really something and Ricardo was addicted to her and that can happen to anyone with anything in Life. <br /> <br />Again I has a great time reading it and recommend it to anyone to read it with a relaxed approach, do not try to be to intelectual about the book just enjoy your read as a distraction to the routine of your lifes. <br /> <br />LJS
0375836675|4.0|I agree with all the other reviewers that this is an excellent book, well written, and captivates the reader.  Non the less, like all Mysteries, the suspense leads up to the grand finale which I found vaguely disappointing.  It is beautifully suspenseful, and I recommend that you should go out and buy this book and read it--but I did feel slightly that the unusual ending was a bit of a cop-out that negates some of the power in the book.  Still a more than worthy way to spend your afternoon.
B000002UA5|4.0|...and that's just talking about the studio album. I first bought this awesome package in 1998 when I was a freshman in college. On top of that, I bought the Shine On box set a week before - so there was a lot of Floyd to listen to.     Anyway, the live album is simply amazing! \\"Astronomy Domine\\" just sounds so much more jazzier in this version as compared to the studio cut on Piper. I love how the guitar and drums practically explode during the middle instrumental interlude and Rick's organ solo was simply awesome. I do agree that the vocals in this version are rather weak, but then again, this is Floyd - warts and all.    \\"Careful with that Axe, Eugene\\" is still one of three or four of the creepiest cuts on this album. Roger's scream still sends shivers down my spine when I hear that cut.    \\"Set the Controls\\" was probably my least favorite live cut, but I still like it nevertheless with Rick given a chance to shine on the organ again. The middle section just builds and builds to a climax. Then it's all quiet again - probably PF's best at the art of dynamics.    \\"Saucerful of Secrets\\" is my favorite cut on this album, especially towards the end of the first section and all of the second section. Also, listen again to Rick's organ at the beginning of the last section when he plays those wierd outer space type chords before kicking it into the chord pattern that we all know and love. I love the ending section with the drums. This is way better than the studio cut but I kind of wish it was longer than 12 minutes if they could add more to the middle section - Gilmour goes completely crazy with his guitar. By the way, this is the second of the four creepy songs. An all out assault on your senses.    Ok... now the part that grows on you...    I didn't much care for the studio album at first - after having listened to such masterpieces as \\"Echoes\\", \\"Atom Heart Mother\\", \\"Shine on You Crazy Diamond\\", all of Dark Side, and all of Animals - I had rather high expectations. Ifelt shortchanged at first, but, and a big but, as I listened to this album more, I thought that the Floyd had created a masterpiece of Avant Garde on this record.    At first, I really didn't much care for \\"Sysyphus\\" but I did like part two quite a bit. Part four was very nice and serene, kind of gives you that picture of a beautiful scene... BAM!!!! Next thing you know your hit with a chord that is guaranteed to make you jump out of your seat, or throw you against a wall. Then it's more wierd noodling by Rick Wright, giving you a picture of insanity put to music. And then he reprises the fanfare. I WARN YOU, YOU WILL JUMP OUT OF YOUR SEAT - GUARANTEED!!!! Third of fourth creepy song. And check out the inside sleeve of Rick Wright in the studio album - he looks like he's gone completely insane - just like his music on this disc.    At least Roger had a song to make you calm down after nearly having a cardiac arrest in part four of Sysyphus. Unfortunately, I never really much cared for this song, not because of the style of music involved - in fact, it's quite lovely - but at over 7 minutes - it's a little too long for a song like this. But I thought it was funny that you can hear a fly getting swatted with a newspaper before kicking it off to \\"Several Species\\"... THIS IS AVANT GARDE... five minutes of wierd sound effects and a scottish rant. This \\"song\\" got on my nerves at first but has grown on me a little bit. Probably the weakest tracks on the album.    \\"The Narrow Way\\" in my opinion is the best track on this album and David Gilmour was not hesitant to showcase all of his guitar pyrotechnics. From Folk to Death Metal and Avant Garde - to Space Rock to Pop - this track has it all. A quintessential Floyd track, this sowed the seeds of the future of Pink Floyd at it's very finest. I think Dave did a better impersonation of Nick Mason than Nick himself. An awesome track! Part two is creepy with the Death Metal riff.    \\"Grand Vizier\\" was a strange cut but part one and three does a good job in closing out the album. The drum solo in part two is very strange indeed - gives you the impression that anything will happen on this track. And it does because I like how the drums were \\"cut up\\" halfway through. I also love the crossfading between the \\"cut up\\" drums and Nick's drum kit playing in the background. Very wierd, but great if you're into production techniques as I'm sure there was a lot of that involved.    At first, I felt dissappointed with the album when I first bought it, but after time - I've grown to really like it and it is indeed a masterpiece in Avant Garde and Psychedelia. Good stuff - definitely warrants the four stars - exceptions for me are both of Waters' tracks and part three of Sysyphus - too John Cage for my liking... But if you should buy this album for any reason, get it for the live album and the \\"The Narrow Way\\" because you will not be dissappointed. Also, this album is for die-hard fans. I wouldn't even recommend \\"Animals\\" (my favorite PF album of all time) to a new Floyd fan. If you want to get into early Floyd, at least get Dark Side first if you're new, or even Echoes - then grab some early PF like Meddle, Obscured by Clouds, More, and Piper before grabbing this one.
B000003CMB|5.0|One of the best live performances ever. The guitar solos are some of the best I've heard.
B000F1IQNC|5.0|A great movie for the entire family.  This film should become a family tradition just as many of the Disney films.

B000GIXEIG|3.0|Buy the DVD for the cinematography-- the script is terrible, the script-story needs sharpening; editing could be improved. Though Gerard Butler did his best without a great \\"blueprint\\"; the script tanks this movie.  Beowulf needs a script that elevates the hero, his actions, one that could have played on the language of fear, the heart of Beowulf....the movie falls apart without excellent dialogue, where its most needed- character revelation. <br />Young filmmakers, as well as old, experimenting with all sorts of \\"storytelling/showing techniques\\", such as non-linear, and \\"scant dialogue\\" styles, should remember that to be human is to feel, and to speak. We don't know what a character is thinking (usually) on screen, so... while \\"action speaks louder than words\\", it is often refreshing, and just as exciting, to hear great battles with words, sparring dialogue, mince-meat, rapier-sharp word-play -- be it witty, cutting, or profound. <br />Beowulf & Grendel lacks a heart, and the soul of humans confronting fear, and the unknown...in this terror-filled story-- Once again, a classic is butchered. <br /> <br />Cinephile: BARD <br />

B00005JLH3|5.0|The DVD came in a short amount of time, and it was in great condition, like new
B000JU7NCE|5.0|This is essentially a stripped down version of the band without the keyboards, sounding more like they did back in the early days. The Cure is no stranger to small lineups, starting out as only a 3 piece and evolving from there. So going from the previous 5-man lineup to the current 4 is really nothing new. This is a return to the raw Cure sound that started it all- just guitar, bass, and drums.    Returning guitarist Porl Thompson does a pretty good job filling in for the lack of keyboard by adding additional effects and riffs to his playing. Some of the more popular songs suffer without the keyboard, but older tunes like Figurehead, Drowning Man, and M are just killer.     The video is a combination of pro-shot footage mixed with some fan-shot footage, giving you somewhat of a feeling of the real live experience. Naturally the quality is going to vary, but it's mixed fairly well with a few special effects thrown in to keep it interesting throughout. I especially liked the mix of widescreen and full screen visual overdubbing in Fascination Street.    This DVD may not be as 'polished' as the others, but it's about as raw and real as the Cure gets. Enjoy it for what it is, another unique and brief moment in time for this great band.
B00005R1N3|5.0|this is one of the better slasher films i have seen. most people think that halloween was the first movie to film from the killers point of view but the truth is black christmas did that and the holiday theme before anyone that i know of. this is a must see for anyone who can really appretiate a good slasher film. this movie has a good storyline and pretty desent cast. it has many things that other film makers have copyed but very very few have done a better job
B000KX0HVY|5.0|If you were stranded on an island and could only take one Elvis cd with you this would be the perfect one.There is not a bad song on this cd and it is a good and pleasant listening mix of all of his music.You get the blues,rock,rockabilly,gospel,movies,and some live concert music.One of the best arrangements of songs of all the cds that have been released since his untimely death.If you grew up listening to Elvis music it will bring back so many memories and if you are just getting acquainted with his music you will be pleased and will build happy memories.Not a bad price.Buy it,play it once and you will not want to play anything else for a long time.You will be hooked.This cd brings to mind what all the fuss was about.
0679411585|5.0|I finished the book over a month ago-I usually don't review at all- <br />& especially with the top review from Ramon A. Nadal who participated <br />in the battle-[much respect] <br />However I thought it was a pretty even-handed account of the battle-policies of the time & emotional content wasn't overdone. <br />I prefer documentery style books/movies etc... <br /> <br />It wasn't masked by any 60's rhetoric of the times- <br />which is nice-altho it was very \\"in the moment\\". <br /> <br />I wanted to get a feel for real combat-as opposed to soldiers as numbers- as Im actively opposing aggressive wars in Afghanistan & Iraq. <br /> <br />John Findlay
0743244257|4.0|Cosmopolis is definitely a good, fun read but probably doesn't rank among his best.  It's short and fast paced so you can breeze though it.  It almost reads like a long short story.  While you probably will read to the end you may feel that the novel didn't quite make it.  Nevertheless, I certainly don't regret reading this novel.

0307276902|5.0|Even amid controversy, this is a good read. It's even better in an audiobook.  The reader is \\"Perfect\\" in his portrayal of thoughts, beliefs, torment, agony.  You will remember this book and find much feeling for it's characters.

0553212443|5.0|From our childhood we have heard various versions of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" or seen movies based upon this classic. The story always succeeds in getting you into the Christmas spirit and making you truly realize the value and meaning of Christmas. The morals of selflessness, caring, and generosity this story instills within you are unforgettable. This is truly a masterpiece!!! The holiday season would not be complete without reading some version of this story and that is why I believe this classic will be popular with many generations to come.  <br />                                                       - Ethan Butler <br />

0553565915|2.0|I purchased this book years ago ... since it was the holiday season and I knew my sister would enjoy this book so I decided to ship it to her. It's just a couple of days after New Years day so I haven't heard from her yet BUT ... I can tell you it is a great book. Keeps you reading and reading even if you're tired and want to sleep. This book has traveled to Viet Nam and back with another friend who loved it too and gave it back as I requested ... I won't give this book up because I like to re-read it every so often ... yes, it's that good!!!
0618680004|5.0|The book was cogent, logical, thoughtfull.  It converted me from being a nambi-pambi agnost into a fairly confident born again atheist. The authors arguments are strong and irrefutable. It is amazing to me that when it comes to religion logic is out the window,  but Richard Dawins does not let up. If logic could triumph it would be laid out in The God Delusion. Religion can be dangerous to you health as we have seen on 9/11,the Witch Trials at New Salem and the Inquisition to name a few.  The arguments in the book define and spell out the clear and present dangers we face with the believers, why religion is a detremental ideolgy and rather on the dark side, why morality and religion have little, if anything, to do with each other. This is a must read for all  fence sitters on the topic of religion; it may be a life changing experience for them.
B000GG4Y32|5.0|This movie was brilliant 25 years ago and is still awe inspiring today.  Jack Reed and Louise Bryant were journalists, lovers, and ultimately revolutionaries who documented the rise of Communism in Russia.  Warren Beatty and Diane Keaton were brilliant as the two main characters, and the supporting caste was just as magnificent.<br /><br />The story told in Reds might seem somewhat obscure to most Americans today.  Few know who Reed, Bryant, Max Eastman and Emma Goldman were, and fifteen years after the fall of the Soviet Union a movie that documents (some who obviously haven't watched it all the way through assert that it glorifies) the rise of Communism in Russia would appear to be dated at best.  Reds should not be passed up, however. It depicts a world in which revolutionary change, great literary and artistic experimentation, and mindless repression coexisted.  The segments depicting the Red Scare in the United States in the early 1920s are particularly instructive and illuminating for Americans living under the Patriot Act today!
B0000DBJDM|1.0|It''s not about the music.  Pink Floyd sitting around talking and drinking and eating and, oh yeah, playing once in a while.  The songs are done much better on their regular albums/music videos.
0761944524|5.0|this 2nd edition is a major improvement of the authors first effort. it is well written, sprinkled with humor, and fairly comprehensive.  it would have been nice if some items such as ROC curves and interrupted time series analysis had been included, but otherwise a very worthy effort indeed. my bias would have been to be a bit more comprehensive and to have lost the equations to save on space. considering that most other stats books are completely besotted with equations and statistical jargon that makes them unreadable, this does deserve 5 stars.  in general, most statisticians who write books forget who their audience is .. they are not writing for each other .. they are writing for people in the real world who don't care about the equations .. they need to identify meaningful associations and results.  In any case, this book works and i highly recommend it to anyone who is starting to use SPSS.  although before they tackle this, i would strongly urge any novice to statistics to take a look at \\"PDQ Statistics\\" by Norman and  Strier. that book is just spectacular .. short, funny, and unbelievably informative, especially for anyone working in the life sciences.

0553583182|5.0|This book was the first I read with this type of content and it just blew me away. Since then I have read a large number of similar books but this would have to be one of the top 5. It literally changed my way of thinking. If you are in a rut or can't see any hope for the future then I definitely recommend this one.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|The songs on Bob Dylan's newest CD, Modern Times, while more understated, compare lyrically with his best writings of the 60s.  This is a thoroughly enjoyable road trip with Bob, accompanied by some of the best studio musicians I have ever heard.  Bob's melancholy vocals are soothing.

1594200823|5.0|After reading The Omnivore's Dilemma I have become more aware of how the production of our food affects our health and environment. From E-coli outbreaks to American obesity, the mass-media tends to gloss over the causes of our food problems and generally ignore how they are connected with energy consumption, the economy, and the decisions we have made about how we want to live.  <br /> <br />The truth is we don't really like to think about where our food comes from, but we know that we should. Pollan's book, The Omnivore's Dilemma, makes it a little easier to start that undertaking. It is overwhemingly fair in it's approach and does not take anything for granted. As Pollan points out, if you want to understand meat production in America you have to start by contemplating blades of grass in a meadow. The Omnivore's Dilemma helps you make that switch in perspective allowing you to see where a blade of grass fits into the entire interconnected web of what we eat, and who we are because of it.

032147404X|3.0|My boyfriend sent me this book as Christmas present and I've read through the whole book now. The pros:    1. There are indeed many solid tips for photography. Especially good for beginners.    2. On every and each page there is a good picture serving as the example of the tip applied.    3. The price of this book is fair, considering the quality of the paper used in prining.      Cons:    1. There are way too many unnecessary words which have nothing to do with photography techniques in this book. Nowadays it might be trendy to write any book with a light and entertaining style but the bloated text somehow degrades the usability of this book. This book isn't really suitable as a technical reference book since the meaty text is often buried in irrelavant text.     2. If you've been reading around in popular photography sites on internet, you'll find all the tips in this books very familiar, you've encountered them again and again in numerous online toturials for free.    3. All the tips can be condensed down on an A4 paper (font size: 12). And if you need a reference when you are shooting pictures, just take this piece of paper instead of the book.

B00065JTBA|5.0|I originally bought this box set for my sister.  I was looking for something with all BJ songs on it, since she is a newer fan of Bon Jovi.  When I received the box set I was surprised.  It didn't contain any of the known songs, with the exception of demos.  What it does contain are the demos and the songs that never made it to the CDs.  I fell in love with this box set and kept it for myself.  Some of Bon Jovi's BEST songs are on here, such as The Radio Saved My Life tonight, Edge of a Broken Heart, and Sympathy.  If you are a long time Bon Jovi fan that has every album buy this boxed set.  If you are new to Bon Jovi, like my sister, make sure you have everything else first.      Also, this boxed set contains a DVD, where the band talks about the box set and the songs.  Although I have not seen it all the way through.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|There is no queation; Bob Dylan is The Man and this hasn't changed for over 40 years. With him as the subject and Scorsese directing, the result is an incredible experience. For even marginal Dylan fans, this is a must have for your DVD collection.
0316172324|3.0|The author declares \\"introspection destroys your ability to solve insight problems.\\"  He then builds a case for acknowledging the subtle influences that can bias our impressions or instinctive reactions and suggests that with insight we can train ourselves to shift our reactions (the results of our rapid decision making).  Introspection or lack of it can both work toward positive goals in our own maturity and training.  But then he contradicts his theory by showing how we make good decisions - and bad decisions - by relying on intuition.  Oops - different kinds of intuition.  One is well-trained and the other not.  OK.  So we can re-train our intuition with new input.   <br /> <br />The book is written more like a series of interesting and informative stories roughly related to a theme than a book on a topic.  And there are some inconsistencies.  Just be alert.  The author wanders through various subjects that have some relationship to the theme.  It's a pleasant journey, but I wasn't surprised to read at the end that he writes for a magazine.  In retrospect the book reads more like a collection of themed articles than a cohesive whole.   <br /> <br />Still, it gave me a more concrete appreciation for the intuitive sense I've developed after years in my profession and more confidence to rely on it.  It's also given me a bit more critical and sympathetic eye for evaluating the actions of others after the fact.   Every juror should read about  split second judgments and instinctive reactions that allow us to make instant decisions under pressure.  You'll never look at police shootings or hospital emergency room mistakes in quite the same way.  <br /> <br />It gets bogged down in places.  But don't let that or the flaws keep you from taking away some gems from this book.
B00004W510|5.0|Words can't do justice.  I can't add anything to the tributes that others have provided, but neither can I leave this page without throwing in my personal \\"Amen.\\"  This is perhaps my favorite album of all time.  I knew a couple of the songs from the Band's 70's hits package when I picked this one up.  But -- surprise! -- those were probably the weakest songs on the album.  I envy anyone the experience of picking this up for the first time and exploring all the \\"filler\\" tracks on here.  The first notes of \\"Across the Great Divide\\" hooked me, and 30 years later I've found few musical experiences to match.  My only caution to new purchasers might be -- well, it can't be quite the same experience on CD.  Same incredible music, but this one was made to be an LP.  This is one of the coolest looking albums ever.  This is not an album to fit in a pocket.
0689865384|5.0|I loved this book! And I can't wait until I get my hands on the other two in the trilogy. Apart from having a great plot line, engaging characters, and exciting adventures, it has a great message for all of its readers, one that would be unique to each individual. I truly loved this book and would recommend all of my clients and kids to read it. If you have any doubts at all, please let this one of many postively glowing reviews help sway your decision: trust us, it's well worth the read.
B000IZJZLM|5.0|Who can go wrong with Barbra Streisand and Oprah on your side?  I saw this group on Oprah and got tears in my eyes from the intensity and passion of their voices and presentation!!

0060853980|5.0|Crowley and Aziraphale have a little problem.  You see, they are both supernatural beings (a demon and an angel, respectfully) who have been on earth since the Garden of Eden, and have come to like it here.  They have grown closer to each other, in many ways, than their respective \\"bosses.\\"  Therefore, when the End of the World rolls around, neither one wants to see war break out.<br /><br />Stopping Armageddon should be easy, really.  After all, eleven years ago Crowley was handed the baby Antichrist, whom he placed in the hands of a Satanist nurse.  The child was to be raised by an evil nanny, who would teach it how to use its unholy powers.  Only problem: somewhere along the line, the babies got switched.  The Antichrist is nowhere to be found.  And life as we know it ends on Saturday.<br /><br />\\"Good Omens\\" is one of the funniest things I've read in ages.  I love twists on age-old concepts; and there's nothing more ironic than making Armageddon humorous.  It's about time, I say!  Parodying everything from traditional concepts of Heaven and Hell, to social norms and political situations, yet doing so with tact while at the same time presenting plausible ideas, Gaiman and Pratchett offer up a true delight.  \\"Good Omens\\" will keep you turning pages until you just can't laugh anymore.  A fun, thoughtful read.
B000H7J9RQ|4.0|I love Streisand and this is one of my favorite concerts. I'm so glad they included some of Robin Williams monologue. Sorry the introduction was only an audio track, it would've been nice to hear AND SEE Babs impressions on this concert after all these years. Will we ever see a video version of her box set? I understand there was something bootlegged some time ago running around. The sound is incredible! Packaging could be better.
B000050XEI|5.0|This selection of music from Enya could easily be called \\"The Best of Enya\\" for my money.  The music is Melodic and at the same time Uplifting - - it evokes a relaxed state of mind and body and recharges the psyche. I would heartily recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys easy listening.
0307346609|5.0|Max Brooks has attempted to create a convincing documentary style novel with 'World War Z' and succeeds in doing so, and makes it as horrifying as it is authentic. Reading it, you will find sometimes you may believe this happened. <br /> <br />The book chronicles first person accounts of people from the start to the end of what was called 'The Great Panic' starting with a doctor's account of what is believe to be the first recorded Zack, as people refer to the walking dead, in China where the aware government attempt to cover up the outbreak. This, however, results in an exodus of it's citizens who inadvertently spread infection to other countries. The detailed accounts from different people mesh together to make a whole story, detailing how each nation and way of life adapts or combats in the early days to the days of chaos when the walking dead roam the earth. It also details how man's technology fails due to the fact that it's enemy is completely oblivious the ideals of fear and failure. Each account is astounding and shows you what they learned and did to survive in each of their scenarios. This shows Brooks' ability to understand and portray multiple ethnicities and philosophies when they are joined in a conflict which seems to be unwinnable, and yet it shows the soaring spirit of mankind not to succumb and to adapt and survive. <br /> <br />This book is by far one of the most important works to the genre, if not fictional Horror itself, due to it's unique and compelling perspective of it's story which spans decades and does not focus on one hero rather on the whole Human race. Each chapter highlights a different hero or heroine, some good and some bad, but despite the fact you already know they survived their encounters (hence they would not be present to recollect their stories) you still hope they live throught it. <br /> <br />An astounding work, and I hope the writer follows up this novel with something as equally moving, scary and profound.
0790731509|5.0|What can one say about Cool Hand Luke that has not already been written. It is one of the best films ever made. Starring Paul Newman, George Kennedy, J.D.

B0000640VO|4.0|I loved this movie. It was very cleverly done and used some highly imaginative imagery. The French subtitles are a bit off. however. They aren't always complete. To really get all of what this film has to offer, you must know at least basic French.

B000HEWEDK|5.0|This is for the regular dvd edition not the HD DVD. This is one of the best sci-fi space adventures to come out of the 1950s. This set is loaded with bonus features on both discs. Promos, deleted scenes, and lost footage on disc one. The Invisible Boy; Robby the Robot's second motion picture. And three documentaries on disc two. I own the original two-sided one disc version. I saw no difference in picture quality for either edition. Don't panic. The picture looks very good to begin with. The only unfortunate thing is there is still no commentary track from Leslie Nielsen and/or Anne Francis. They do appear in the documentaries. This edtion is roughly 8 seconds shorter than the previous release. Not because of deleted footage. This time we're spared the TURNER tag at the end.
B000E6G4VY|3.0|Perhaps THEIR SATANIC MAJESTIES REQUEST is supposed to be a tongue-in-cheek parody of the psychedelic excesses prevalent in 1967. If so, it succeeds in such aspirations \\"majestically.\\" Or maybe Mick and the boys were only ripping off SGT PEPPER'S as a lark-- I'd like to think this is the case. Merry Pranksters weren't exclusive to California, after all.<br /><br />To really appreciate this album in all its glory, one must see the original LP with its murky animated 3-D plasticine artwork (Look-- they turn their heads!). To savor the music however, a CD is quite sufficient.<br /><br />This set has a lot of terrific songs on it. The only reason it gets a middling rating is \\"Sing This All Together (See What Happens)\\" --an unnecessary endless jumble that brings SATANIC MAJESTIES to a screeching halt-- much like Lennon's car crash does to the White Album on \\"Revolution #9.\\" Both tracks badly mar the records they are on, yet neither experience would be truly complete without them. So, we must muddle through somehow.<br /><br />THEIR SATANIC (etc.) has the distinction of containing both (to my mind) the best and worst examples of the Stones' golden era (1965-'73). The latter of course, being the cacophonous song mentioned above.

B000I2JKEC|4.0|This movie is so good it set really high standards it is one of the three best superhero movies (Batman Begins and Superman Returns) (Well at least I liked Superman Returns) but the things is that the HD is ok it is a lot clearer than the original but not 1080p standards. If your looking for full HD picture this is not it but it's better than SD picture.
B00006LLLN|4.0|The first time I heard this album was on my 2nd date with my (now) husband.  He played \\"Now That I Found You\\" and some of the other ballads on the CDs, which became the soundtrack for our budding romance.  I am not a huge country or bluegrass fan, but I find that the ballads on this CD are soothing in a very classic way.  Allison Kraus' voice is incredible.

B000K4WPCC|4.0|THE COVENANT is not a great film by any definition but it is worth seeing for the cast of characters doomed to portray the rather shoddy script: the live Abercrombie & Fitch appearing models make up for allure in screen presence what they may lack in a solid story.<br /><br />In the 1600s, during the witch trials, there were five families who secretly survived, holding 'The Power', to send their descendants into the future.  It is now present time and four of the families are represented by young hunks, the Ipswich Guys, who are attending a private school in autumnal Massachusetts, careful to keep their Power hidden for the most part: the Power is the ability to do fantastic feats of force and sorcery which, if it is used to much carries the punishment of aging the body quickly...  The four lads are Caleb (20-year old stud model Steven Strait), Pogue (sculpted body man Taylor Kitsch), Tyler (Chace Crawford), and Reid (Toby Hemingway) and aside from Caleb and Pogue the other two are pretty much set decoration, so minimal are their lines and involvement.  Into this setting comes one Chase Collins (Sebastian Stan, a handsome lad from 'The Architect') who just happens to be the surviving member of the fifth family and who is greedy for Power beyond his own abilities.<br /><br />A series of confrontations results in Caleb facing Chase in a showdown, but not before the girls involved with the good guys - Caleb's girlfriend Sarah (Laura Ramsey) and Pogue's girlfriend Kate (Jessica Lucas), equally as beautiful as their partners are handsome - critically enter the picture.  There is, of course, a showdown in an old ancestral barn during the requisite thunder and lightning storm background which serves as a stage for the silly computer generated graphics that throw Caleb and Chase around with jellyfish balls and the like.  The ending makes it very clear that a sequel (probably more than one) is planned and if that means more exposure for this attractive young cast of actors, bring it on.<br /><br />Director Renny Harlin and writer J.S. Cardone know they have a kitschy formula movie and seem to have a great time making it as fun and creepy as possible - good music, great lighting and camera work, and a penchant for locker room shower scenes that guarantee success with the intended audience.  THE COVENANT is often silly but it is a good escapist movie and may just be the springboard for some new faces!  Grady Harp, January 07Director Renny Harlin and writer J.S.

B000FVQM2Y|5.0|this is a very well made movie.  a film noir mystery set at a modern day highschool.  the acting is excellent, the cinematography is great.  the story is extremely faced pace, but the director makes you want to pay attention.  what i particularly loved was the banter.  the dialogue was peppered with slag that can only be understood with careful attention to its context.  for example, using the term \\"the bulls\\" to mean police.  most of the movie is pretty dark, but some scenes had me laughing out loud, even when watching by myself.  joseph gordon-levitt gives a great performance, playing the resourceful highschool rebel.  because brick is so fast paced, it should be viewed a few times, which makes purchasing the dvd a good idea.  i would recommend this film to almost anyone, especially someone who appreciates film as an artform.
B000ICL3KG|2.0|I am from Tennessee and have been familiar with Al Gore and his ability to insert exagerated images of himself into any topic.  The most famous example of which was his claim of inventing the internet.  I bought his movie because I was hoping to get a little more education on global warming.  While some of the prentation was worthwhile, Al spent entirely too much time talking about himself as opposed to the topic of the movie.  The global warming information could have been presented in 1/3 of the time taken up by the movie.  There must have been 10 minutes spent on shots of Al staring pensively at his notebook computer screen which was a overused prop throughout the movie.  We had to hear again about how guilty he and his family felt about raising tobacco after his sister died of lung cancer.  While I sympathize with Al and his family over their loss, I am a little tired of hearing about it, especially when it has nothing to do with global warming.  I also beleive much of the global warming evidence presented in the film was one sided and a little statisically misleading, particularly when graphical information was sometimes presented with a numerically labeled x/y axis scale and other graphical information was presented conveniently excluding a measureable x/y scale.  I beleive global warming is a real issue we need to confront and honestly and objectively.  I think Al's self promoting movie on this subject failed my standard.  Al's movie treats global warming as a political argument which he must win where less than honest and objective means are justified by his cause.  While Al certainly has not dipped as low as a Michael Moore, he has further spent credibility which he has little left to spare.

I know I'm forgetting more, but you get the idea.<br /><br />Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber were brilliantly led by the direction of Veteran Chris Columbus (Home Alone and tons more).

But Azkaban was the first hand-off of the director baton from Columbus to the short resumed, mostly-foreign-film-guy Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n.

Be that as it may, the change in \\"direction\\" really shone through. And Cuar&oacute;n was gone for Goblet.<br /><br />Goblet comes in with three changes in direction: 1) The director change from Cuar&oacute;n back to another vet in Mike Newell, 2) The exit of Columbus oversight, and 3) A shift from...shall we say...a more famlyish Harry Potter to a more dark Harry Potter (the way it was intended!). And this did not go un-noticed by the MPAA.<br /><br />It's must be tough to make a PG movie these days; it's hard to believe that the MPAA took the Potter series from a PG rating to a PG-13 rating for Goblet. Kids 13 and under can see uglier violence and hear more profanity at school recess and at the local playground than they do in Goblet...better start a rating system for playgrounds! How is it that a movie like Goblet without a curse-word or graphic act of violence (by today's standards anyway) gets thrown into the same category as, for example, S.W.A.T. (2003) that does indeed not only have the F-word, but strong violence and sex? Ludicrous. But I won't get started on how unfair the MPAA is and how neurotically insane the pressure is from certain groups on the MPAA to \\"protect\\" our youth.<br /><br />I will indeed finish by saying that the first four of the Harry Potter releases combined have grossed close to $2,000,000,000 (that's a TWO BILLION dollars) because they're excellent movies that kids can watch too.

0618680004|5.0|This book is a pleasure to read. Of course Dawkins doesn't exhaust the arguments against religious belief - it would be hard to cover all the bases in a single book - but what he's done is to produce a cogent, pithy and above all immensely readable counterblast against the current resurgence of politicised religion. It's not necessary to agree with all of his perspectives - or to share his certainties - in order to appreciate the wit and perspicacity of his arguments. This book is an important element of the scientific community's ongoing counter-offensive against the wave of religious fundamentalism and new age pyschobabble that threatens to engulf us all. It arms us with some powerful debating tools, and it's a good book to pass on to your friends, especially if they're of a religious persuasion. Last but not least, if you enjoy sharp polemics this book makes for an immensely enjoyable read.

I see all the other bad reviews and they're getting very low percentage for how helpful they are, and I can't help but think that all those votes are from Air-affiliated entities.

1400079179|3.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  I considered it to be the top thriller of 2006.  However, I was disappointed by the book.  The following are a few reasons why the movie is better.  Bear in mind that I may be biased because I watched the movie first.  I had already formed my own idea of the story before reading it.  (Most reviewers who claim that the book is better may suffer from the opposite.)<br /><br />I thought that Book would provide more background information on the founding of Priory of Sion, Opus Dei and Merovigian bloodline.  What I got was superficial discussion on goddess worshipping and overdone sex rituals.  It made me grateful that the Church suppressed all that ages ago.<br /><br />Silas is the most sympathetic character in the movie.  His death is the stuff of tragedy.  I do not feel the same way about him in the book.  His death is practically ruined.  In the book, he and Bishop Aringarosa supposedly sustained heavy gun wounds.  Silas was able to bring Aringarosa to a London hospital, slipped out into a city park and died unnoticed.  Where were the hospital personnel?<br /><br />In contrary of what the book claims, Richard Wagner was not a freemason.  This bit of misinformation undermines my confidence in other esoteric theories expounded by the author.<br /><br />One cryptex enhances mystery.  Two is overkill.<br /><br />The main reason that the movie is better than the book is:  The movie implicates the Catholic Church in the main plot of the theft of the Grail.  The book, on the other hand, lays the entire blame on one person, Leigh Teabing, who masterminded murders and extortion.  Bishop acted on his own interest, thus divesting the Church with any responsibilities.  But, what a Bishop of Opus Dei wanted with the Holy Grail?  The book says that he wanted to use it to gain influence with the Pope.  However, a Bishop of Opus Dei can hardly reveal the Grail without undermining his own position.  Considering the history of the Church, the movie plotline is only more appropriate and realistic.  I suspect that was Dan Brown's original intention.  He altered it to pass the censorship in publication, and readapted it in the subsequent movie version.rch, the movie plotline is only more appropriate and realistic.

You don't really want to know the secret... You want to be fooled.\\"   If someone knows how an illusion is done DON'T TELL ME!! Just let me be amazed!

All the twists are what made it a wonderful experience for me. I felt the cast was well picked and the actors gave their hearts to it all. I don't walk out of many movies saying I want to go see that again.

0743454537|3.0|This is a 400+ page book that is at least 150 pages too long.  I bought it to read on a plane ride from Texas to Los Angeles, so at least was happy that I didn't run out of reading material in the middle of the flight, but that's about the best I can say. <br /> <br />The story is told from the viewpoints of the five family members, as well as Anna's attorney and her guardian ad litem.  At least three of those viewpoints could have been edited out as being reduntant, and several characters needed serious revamping to make them more realistic.  The children's voices didn't ring true, and the guardian ad litem was just silly. <br /> <br />Further research should have been done on court procedure.  Just a couple of examples:  a hearing like this would never take up an entire week of the court's time; both parents were sued but the father wasn't represented by Sara or anyone else; and no judge in his right mind would have allowed the behavior that went on in that courtroom. <br /> <br />The ending was cheap, contrived, and maudlin.

This book's premise has been written about (although not in \\"The DaVinci Code\\" genre) in countless self-help books over the years - the most popular and enduring being Dr. Norman Vincent Peale's \\"The Power of Positive Thinking.\\" \\"The secret\\" is repeated ad nauseum through quotes from various New Age gurus for 184 mind-numbing pages.  The numerous celebrity talk-show endorsements only makes \\"The Secret\\" and its \\"Oh my gosh!\\" DVD a best-selling gold mine for its authors.  It reveals nothing new.
0393061434|4.0|I have been a personal friend of Woz for over 20 years and came to know him through his work with and generosity to Ballet San Jose (formerly San Jose Cleveland Ballet).  His book sounds exactly like the way he talks.  I could have been listening to a recording of him telling his story.  He is a brilliant person, but so down to earth and unpretentious.  It was great fun to read his account of his life in his own words.  I would recommend it to anyone who has any interest in Apple, Silicon Valley or the characters who started it all.  It's a quick and enjoyable read.

0898159156|5.0|This book is worth its weight in gold, plain and simple. It is an absolutely wonderful collection of history, humor, scientific and horticultural information about virtually all known types of carnivorous plants. While not geared toward the die hard biologist, it is packed with enough detailed information about the plants, presented in clear and elegant fashion, that it will satisfy readers from almost any background.<br /><br />In this book you will find, without a doubt, some of the best information for growing these wonderful and increasingly rare plants. Whether you're a novice grower or have a modest collection, there is something for you in this book. This book covers it all, from growing medium to green houses, from terrariums to watering techniques, it's all there in clear, concise form and expertly organized.<br /><br />This book is literally a steal at its current price and I would easily pay twice as much for it. There is a reason that this book has gotten, with one exception at this time, five star ratings from everyone that reviewed it. It's the same reason that anyone and everyone who seriously grows carnivorous plants already owns a copy. Do yourself and your plants a favor and buy this book.
0307346609|5.0|Max Brooks brings a lot of his father with him in the writing of this book.  Hopefully this will transfer into a great onscreen work.  The world war Z shows what would happen if a outbreak of \\"zombie\\" would happen in this modern world of ours.
1883010039|5.0|Even if you've never woven before, this book explains every aspect of weaving in such a clear and friendly way that you'll have the confidence you need to get started, even on your own. The author breaks down every step from project planning and warping, to reading weaving drafts with clear explanations, drawings and photos. Even for experienced weavers it is an excellent resource book with a reed substitution chart, sett chart and troubleshooting chart listing problems with possible causes and solutions. This is the book that all of my beginning weaving students use and actually enjoy reading.
0743298020|2.0|The description of this book was very inticing. It started out good, easy to follow with an interesting story. Two thirds into it the events became too improbable and the characters unbelievable. Overall it was an unhappy story, that made me feel it was a waste of time
0618680004|5.0|Possibly the best book ever written on the villainy of religion. Dawkins demonstrates that religions cannot offer us reliable ethical values, because their moral system was created to guarantee happiness to one single (invisible) individual: God. Once you start reading this book you cannot stop. It is a shaft of light in a world obscured by magic darkness. Reading this magnificent work gave me hope that religious bigotry will pass and Humanity will prevail.
B00065MDSQ|5.0|This is one of the references in power rock, not only for being an album from KC but for the line-up, probably the best in rock history (sorry to Rush'Lee-Peart supporters). This is a conjunction of several factors like a superband of supermusicians in the peak of their careers that make possible one of the summits in prog-rock. <br />I am a lover of rhythm sections and can assert this is my favourite.   <br />If you pressume of your discography this is an album that you are obligued to owe, beleive me. <br />
B000J103OI|3.0|didnt like it as much as the book..but it was enjoyable anyway.Meryl Streep is wonderful.
B000F7CMRM|5.0|I did not find the interlocking stories hard to follow, I did not find the motivations hard to fathom and I did not fell preached at either ( All morality is \\"in play\\" in this movie. ). <br />If the political thriller, emphasis on political, is not to your taste that's OK there are lots of other movies. <br />If you don't agree with the political view point that's OK as well. <br />What's not OK is going to the movie and then complaining because it isn't something else or you don't agree or you think it made you work to hard. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

B000BTC5LW|5.0|I am a huge Pink Floyd fan, and already own Pulse on VHS. The new 2 DVD set is a huge improvement in sound quality, and I love all the extra features, especially \\" bootlegging the bootleggers\\", and the roadies behind the scenes documentary. The ease with which you can navigate this  DVD for your favorite songs a definate plus  over  the VHS version. For true Floyd fans, this concert DVD is it's the next best thing to being there!
B000BNX3AU|3.0|This was a \\"cute\\" movie, not a great one. There is a fair amount of humor, an occasional surprise, and decent dialogue. Although the story line is frequently predictable, the characters are believable and enjoyable.<br /><br />John Cusack's acting is not the best. Diane Lane is beautiful and an excellent actress.<br /><br />If you like \\"feel-good\\" movies, I would recommend this one only if you have an evening without much to do.<br /><br />This movie is horribly overpriced at anything over $9.99.
B00004T9UH|1.0|Imagine a world with wordless lyrics...Impossible? Think again~! Marshall Mathers' rather colorful style has its own place. To attempt to hear what he wants to say but get the message without the swearing...well, that is a little more difficult. From what planet did I just arrive? Duh....Here's me: Oh I like Eminem, but maybe the \\"clean\\" CD will have better word choices. Here's reality: Most of the CD is BLEEPED out. Good grief, what WAS I thinking?  <br /> <br />
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Little-seen movie that deserves to be enjoyed by many more. Do yourself a favour and check out this flick.  Better than most blockbusters by a country mile.  And, if you like the film, go get Firefly the series.  That short-lived show is brilliant beyond words.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|Love this CD, have seen John Mayer live twice now and this album is one of his best.  If you like his early work, this is a bit different.  Belief is the track I can't stop playing now.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Having grown up in Flint I must say I have a different view of Michael than most of the people who still live there.  My ex-wife was trying to recruit a new librarian to come to Flint when Michael brought out his first, \\"Roger and Me.\\"  Good luck with that.  Perhaps because I had already moved away I could separate Michael as the messenger from his message(s).  It is with his same sharp insight that he delivers a stinging critique of the Bush Administration in this awesome documentary. If you missed it the first time around because you were clinging to the belief that our leader must know what he is doing, don't hesitate now.  NO ONE in the current administration was able to sufficiently dispute any of Michael's facts or conclusions.  Buy this incredible piece of history today.
B000FS9FC6|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie.  It made history fun.  Granted it took one tee-tiny little speck and blew it up and put a new dress on it.  V for Vendetta will, or at least should, definitely make its way into your DVD collection.
B000002MUN|5.0|I love this CD. I had it but it got all scratched and skipped so i just had to get another one to replace it.
B00003CXB4|4.0|This movie was pretty good i have a VHS and it was being wore out by replay after replay so i thought the DVD would be a better option.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|To me this sounds like an updated version of the best of 1970's album based rock. I heard it on the only local station that plays contemporary hard/alternative/metal/good-old rock. The songs flow together, are fast paced and require musicians that can actually play their instruments. They are reminiscent of groups that now exist only in old LP collections.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|Loved it so much i play it over and over again.  Thanks to you and to the artist preforming it.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|I love this movie (and give the movie itself 5 stars) but this is a chopped off version and loses a lot of the beautiful images when played on a computer. This widescreen is actually the fullscreen version with the top and bottom cut off. Compare the fullscreen and widescreen versions (I have both) and you will see this. What a shame that there is no way to re-experience the beauty of this film as it was shown in the theatres.
0790729636|5.0|Love this movie.  I had this one in VHS and it was getting wore out from all the playing so i decided to get the DVD so we could get many more hours of enjoyment.  Love Bill Paxton who my daughter met while he was filming Frayaty (not sure if that's how to spell that)and love Hellen Hunt she's good in just about any movie she's in.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|She's a great artist. The whole album is wonderful. If you like anything you hear on the radio from her, you'll enjoy the whole album.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I never watched Firefly while it was on, but all my children are fans, and all own this set of DVDs.  I have watched most if not all of the episodes and became a fan.  I highly recommend this DVD series.
B00004XPPC|5.0|This Movie is one of the clasics in the film world although the movies is somewhat true but never the less its a must see movie. <br />Having been to the actual site where the bridge is it brings home the tragic loss of life, along with the conditions that the men had to face and having been in the Malayan forces in 1959 to 1961 and the life of the jungle is and does test your capable abilties.i am in awe of the courage of the men at the bridge of the River Kwai. I treasure the movie as a prized collection. <br />D J gartner
B000GG4KTU|5.0|While I liked Diana's previous album (\\"The Girl in the Other Room\\") of songs that she wrote, I am glad she got back to covering Jazz classics with this new album.  I play my music in the background from iTunes while I work, and listen to my iPod while at home doing yard work, and Diana's music is relaxing and enjoyable to listen to.  I usually play in \\"shuffle mode\\" so it is a pleasant surprise when one of her songs comes up.  I highly recommend all of Diana's music.  If you see her in concert, the concert hall will need to be quiet so that you can hear all of the nuances of her music.
0307237699|5.0|Unbelieveable, not in the sense of \\"you can't believe him\\", but in the sense of \\"I can't believe we have actually got the chance for another great man like JFK (or as great as our fantasies of how good he was are) to take residence in the White House!\\" This man is (I believe) significantly younger than I am, and I'm blown away by his intelligence, thoughtfulness, and ability to \\"forgive & forget\\" the mean and nasty things others on the other side of issues have said and done to those of us who really care about helping our fellow men (and women), rather than telling them they have to try harder to survive, and we must \\"let them fend for themselves\\" even if it means subjecting all of us to a \\"law of the jungle\\" type society based on personal greed and selfishness. One other reviewer here said something about how his mentioning a \\"program\\" inevitably meant an expensive wasteful government program that would create dependency and instill stupidity. Boy does he have a cynical view of humans, and programs! But I'll still bet he, or at least most of the people he knows went to a public school \\"Program,\\" which did a fine job of teaching most of us how to read and write etc.! Just because a program is public doesn't mean it going to waste money, nor fail. But because our so called \\"public elections\\" have now been taken over by the big moneyed interests who are buying our politicians and their votes almost completely, we are getting more and more of the \\"law of the jungle\\" elections with candidates LYING right and left and chopping each other to pieces by using Hitler's technique of the big LIE to win elections. (For example, the so called \\"Swift Boat Veterans for the Truth\\", who said they \\"served with John Kerry,\\" then when it was looked into, NONE of them was actually on a boat with him, nor even in the same area of Vietnam at the same time he was. They were all possibly telling the \\"truth\\" by having served in Vietnam during the same year he was there, but in the usual sense of the words, they were completely bold faced lying about their knowledge of what he may have done or not done. Barak Obama seems to rise about that sort of dirty politics by just talking about the issues, and about what's good for our country, and about what good people should do to help their fellow human beings. A program can be good if it helps educate or uplift people to a more independent status, and need not be something that teaches a sense of entitlement, unless it is just a sense of entitlement to being treated as a decent human being who has a right to an education, and a right to hear the truth about health issues, and about people's true backgrounds and qualifications, and to decent healthcare etc.  Enough of a rant, this book is great, and uplifting, much more so than my recommendation, so buy it and start reading!
0571202284|5.0|This is the most amazing book I've ever got ! it starts with the basics and reaches you to the advanced level in Traditional Animation ... well, yes it helps all animation styles, but as a classical animator .. this is the greatest help I've ever received. The book is so planned very well, amazingly. I can keep on and on writing about how I admire this book. It's a resource that you MUST keep with you all the time ! I love it!
0060776757|5.0|Not only is this book filled with  great personal photos, but the interviews with all the band members were candid and filled with information on their lives.  I especially loved reading about each members childhood and the early days of the band.  It is true testimony to the power of friendship that these four guys have stuck with their vision of where they wanted to go and never really gave up on themselves or each other. That is why I think they are the greatest band in the world!!
B00001QEFU|5.0|Twisted Sisters first album ranks close to the top only below the ever popular Stay Hungry. <br /> <br />Under the Blade is Raw, and has an edge to it that only came from that era. <br /> <br />As bands progress, their sound suffers and ultimatly falls short in the sales department due to their untimely evolution. Under the Blade is REAL Twisted and it shows.  <br /> <br />Twisted is one of a small handful of bands that have really kept the same sound throughout their careers. <br /> <br />Get this CD, enjoy it, and relive the good ol' days of music.
B0000252YK|4.0|this CD is the Ultimate Sin! Lots of jams. especially like the song \\"thank God for the Bomb (nuke em nuke em)!\\" its Ozzy what more can I say!
B000H305U0|5.0|I can't deny that I was expecting a lot from this CD since JT has been growing as a singer and producer. The result was not less than this. Great songs, great production and one of the best albums of the year.

0743298020|5.0|Couldn't put this book down.  Had to find out what was going on. Great reading for a cold, rainy day. Writer draws you in.  If you loved Jane Eyre or Rebecca you'll love this.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|I am not a musician, just an average listener and spectator,but I like the movie. Maybe the negative personage - the Primadonna is rather too much overdone (here I remember 'Singing in the Rain')but that may be the matter of taste. And the music, I just like it.
B00005K3OT|3.0|As far as I am concerned, Johnny Depp is best thing in this film. <br />How sweet and handsome he is!
B000BT97AO|5.0|I saw this film at the Uptown independant theater in Minneapolis when it was released and my freind and I were quite blown away.I was skeptical of how the CGI would be presented,but with Dave McKegan at the helm and Niel Gaimen also on board(The two work on comics together such as \\"Sandman\\",and have done art for album covers,most notably the Death Cube K album \\"Disembodied\\") the real and created are virtually seamless!The story may not be 100% original and new,but it's familliarity helps to draw the viewer closer to the abstract world being presented.I thought some parts might be too dark and scary for children under 7 or 8.With that said,I can only hope that the McKegen/Gaimen duo create more films,testing the waters of their creativity.
B000GW8RX4|5.0|awesome!! wish there was something like this for the band when Jimmy Bain and Toney Carey were in the band..but this is as good as there is on vintage Rainbow..if you like Blackmore's playing then this is a no brainer!
0736063684|5.0|This is an absolutely great book. It exceeded my expectations, since it illustrates very clearly the muscles being used during a particular exercise. I am a pictures person, and find this extremely helpful. Must strength training books show the exercise/technique, but do not show the muscles working during a particular exercise. This book is very clear, well done, and enjoyable to use. I have taken it to the Gym when I strength train, and I find the easy to understand illustrations extremely helpful in targeting what muscles I want to work on that partucular training session. Buy it with confidence. The price is great too.

B0007OY2P8|3.0|I watched this dvd within weeks of reading Jane Austen's book of this title.  Both the book and the dvd are a bit drear, but I did find the dvd to be a good representation of the book and the author's intent. For Austen's fans that must have everything \\"Austen\\" they can get their hands on, yes...see it..watch it...enjoy it!

B00005JLD4|2.0|While this wasn't the worse film that I have ever seen it comes close.  This had the potential to be a really awesome and dramatic story, but it turns out to be slightly more interesting than watching paint dry.
020530902X|2.0|I remembered this book from my grad student days as being a succinct and useful guide for grammar as well as style, so I recently ordered a copy with the hope that it might provide rules and examples that would help me help my 6th grader with language arts homework.  Unfortunately, it is not comprehensive enough for this purpose.  For example, the \\"Rules of Usage\\" section states the rule for forming the possessive of singular nouns--but makes no mention of how to form the possessive of plural nouns, much less the difference between regular (boys) vs. irregular (children) plurals and their possessive forms (boys' vs. children's).<br /><br />I do still find the style section (the final 20 pages of the text) to be useful--but it also comes across as a collection of tips and insights rather than comprehensive treatment of the subject.  Since William Strunk wrote the original version as a textbook for his students at Cornell, perhaps his students had already attained mastery in the areas that he did not cover.
0345440900|3.0|This book is full of pretty good advice...except for the breastfeeding advice.  I have known 3 women (myself included) who had children that didn't gain enough weight by breastfeeding every 3 hours as recommended in the EASY plan. This led 2 of us to stop breastfeeding earlier than we wanted when the doctor said that our kids had \\"failure to thrive\\" and recommended supplementing with formula.  The third was able to get her milk supply back up eventually. I think much of the advice is useful specifically the advice to calm down and take a moment to really try to observe and understand what is going on with your baby before you respond.  I also think the sleep advice (ritual and routine) is really helpful.  I think the tone of the book is a bit condescending and self righteous. Don't read it if you are the type to second guess yourself.
0743289412|4.0|i've read a few pages of reviews, and i notice a trend.... <br /> <br />fans of King in general like this book, some a little better than others.... <br /> <br />fans of Kings pure horror (Cujo, Firestarter type reads) hate it, understandably so.... <br /> <br />folks who like his more character driven work really appreciate it for what it is.... <br /> <br />i find myself amongst the 2nd group...not his best work, but far from his worst...i am one who has enjoyed 95% of what he has wrote, some for different reasons, but always because the guy could tell a story, and could create characters, and i think he succeeded here in that respect.....if you want pure horror, this isn't the read for you, and i understand why some don't like it.... <br /> <br />not King's best, but far from his worst.....certainly one of the better novels he's written in the recent past <br /> <br />and to the reviewer who didn't like the ending of the Dark Tower: are you kidding? as much as i didn't want it to end (i consider it his finest writing, hands down....), i couldn't imagine a more perfect ending.... <br /> <br />to each his own....but this book isn't a bad one, unless you are expecting pure keep-you-awake-at-night horror....
B00005JL7Q|4.0|About A Boy revloves around a single man named Will (Hugh Grant) and his relationship with a troubled boy named Marcus. Will lives alone, happily avoiding responsibility by living off the royalities of his \\"one hit wonder\\" father's annoying Chiristmas song, and is content to spend his days watching TV. One day he decides to lie and say he has a two-year-old son to gain the attention of women at a single parent's group; the one he snags introduces him to her friend's 12 year old son Marcus. Marcus takes a liking to Will, and retreats to his apartment everyday to escape the reality of his mother's attempted suicide. Friendships form, troubles are overcome, love is sparked, you know how it works, but the cute and mostly tasteful comedy make this one worth it. <br /> <br />I've always been a big fan of Toni Collette, and here she plays Marcus' depressed and suicidal mother, giving yet again a wonderful performance. Hugh Grant is somewhat predictable, but hillarious nonetheless; he knows what he's doing by now and knows what his audience wants.  <br /> <br />I felt that the movie was trying to evolve too many relationships at the same time, and because of that the most important one (between Will and Marcus) seemed lacking a bit. The plot isn't surprisingly original, but I don't think that's what the writers were going for. I'd still recommend this one, though, if for nothing else a nice laugh.   <br /> <br />If you like this one you'd probably enjoy Dear Frankie.
B000HA4W4S|4.0|Ta-Dah by Scissor Sisters is a decent collection of songs.  It just does not quite measure up to their previous CD.  The arrangements a good and the recording is excellent, but there does not seem to be a really catchy or memorable tune on this CD as there was on the previous CD.  It still is worth a listen to any \\"Sister\\" fans and it indicates that they are serious about their music and will most likely continue to produce very good music.
B00001U0E1|4.0|This film functions on two levels--as a rapturously beautiful love story between Gwyneth Paltrow and Joseph Fiennes, and as a satire on the harsh realities of Elizabethan England in the tradition of \\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\\" and \\"Blackadder II.\\" My favorite part is the boy outside the theater playing with rats, who turns out to be John Webster, future author of Elizabethan gorefests \\"The Duchess of Malfi\\" and \\"The White Devil\\"--Edgar Allen Poe's predecessor and the man who should perhaps be considered the true inventor of giallo. <br />It's a safe bet Elizabethan England was never quite like this. But then the antebellum south was never quite like \\"Gone With the Wind\\" and ancient Rome was never quite like \\"Gladiator.\\" Half the fun is spotting the errors: i.e., Colin Firth inviting everyone to his tobacco plantation in Virginia in 1593, when Jamestown wouldn't be settled until 1607 and tobacco wouldn't be introduced to the colony until 1619 (along with slavery, but that's a different story). <br />All cavils aside, this film does catch a young William Shakespeare at a point in his life when he was trying to break free from Christopher Marlowe's shadow and find his own poetic voice. Joseph Fiennes is splendid as a young \\"Will\\" Shakespeare, a bohemian living on the edge whose art draws its inspiration from life on the street. The historical Shakespeare was in all likelihood gay or bisexual, so it's oddly fitting that he's first attracted to Lady Viola de Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow) when she's disguised as a boy. <br />Ah, Gwyneth . . . it's hard to recapture the crush I had on her when this movie was made. Now she's lost whatever cool she once had. But this was before Coldplay, before Apple, before she said Americans were less intelligent than Brits. Now it seems like she will never repeat the magic of this one film. But it was great while it lasted. <br />The rest of the cast is great, except for the eternally annoying Ben Affleck as Edward Alleyn. Dame Judi Dench's Elizabeth is probably not as close to the original as Bette Davis nor as funny as Miranda Richardson in Blackadder II, but she won a well-deserved Oscar for her role. Geoffrey Rush steals the show as mercenary theater producer Philip Henslowe and Tom Wilkinson has a striking role as ruthless loan shark Mr. Fennyman, who shows an unexpected sensitive side in his reaction to Shakespeare's poetry--indeed, his appreciation of Shakespeare's genius is far more genuine than Henslowe's. <br />This film has suffered perhaps from a post-Oscar backlash and the outrage of critics who thought \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" should have been Best Picture; sure, it's a better film, but at the time we were all so in love with Gwyneth we didn't care. First love is always the best; there will never be another love story like this one, that's for sure. <br />Ric
B000FA57N0|5.0|It's FireFly. It's in beautiful HD. What more can I say. This movie rocks!
B000GFRDN6|5.0|Excellent 5.1 mixes of this album. Once the 5.1 versions of the hit tracks  like Rock n me and Fly like an Eagle and Take the Money and Run are heard at this quality level, all the other cd versions are relatively dull. Great pop album made greater by this terrific version release.
B000BKVQTS|4.0|Whatever Terry Gillam does is always interesting even when it doesn't quite work as in \\"The Brothers Grimm\\". Everything is there, ingenious and original sets and props, lively actors, and a black tinged plot based on the legend of the female Dracula who bathed in maidens' blood.The build-up is great with the disappearance of the fairy tale girls, but the denoument is somewhat of a disappointment and not as ingenious as Mr Gillam usually is.
B000ESSTL0|3.0|The track Personal Jesus is so outstanding that I purchased the entire DVD for that track. It is a stunning example of what 5.1 can sound like.<br /><br />The rest of the album is as good as Depeche Mode is, and the packaging and visuals are gorgeous.

B000002J09|5.0|Reminds me of my high school days. One of my favorite albums.
B000FVQYYK|4.0|Wow, a diverse wall of sound covering everything from disco beats to progressive rock, like Queen for the new century.  Incredibly talented musicians.  If there are any complaints about this album, there are only one or two songs made for radio (is that a bad thing?....)  Highly recommended - my favorite CD of the past year or two.
B000I5X81A|5.0|Too bad every artist cannot live up to this type of longevity and still be on top of his game. Both Eric Clapton and JJ Cale have created a standard with this one!
0780622650|1.0|I love sci fi and hate this movie.  When I mean I love sci fi, I will accept plot flaws to a good premise or special effects.  This movie, has no plot and no premise.  The special affects are good, but not enough to call the movie even remotely enjoyable.  Complete dissapointment. my 2 cents.
B000FIMG68|5.0|Great to own the season since when it's on TV, they tend to put too much time between episodes, or do a lot of repeats. This is the best way to watch a season! Great show....plays with your mind a lot! <br /> <br />
B000ICM5IK|4.0|This album takes all of the great music from the first four Rocky movies and does an excellent job of putting them together on one disc. A great feature not yet mentioned in the Amazon.com reviews is that there are classic lines from the movies placed in between most of the tracks. For example, before \\"No Easy Way Out\\" Rocky says his famous line; \\"Cuz I'm a fighter. That's the I'm made Adrian. We can't change what we are\\" (from Rocky IV). There are a couple problems, however: <br />- Three Six Mafia has no place in a Rocky soundtrack. It does not fit in with the rest of the music and should have been left out. <br />- War and Training Montage are not included. Cut the Three Six Mafia song and the weak (yet still good) track \\"Adrian\\" and we would have had plenty of space for those two gems. <br /> <br />Other than that, this album does a great job in representing a sometimes overlooked aspect of the Rocky movies: The music.
0861714911|5.0|The Pali canon is enormous, heterogenous, and alien-sounding. This book is a wonderful introduction to the general themes and ideas in that canon. It includes bits of texts (as well as many complete suttas) from all five Nikayas, along with helpful introductory essays and valuable notes. This book is a wonderful introduction to \\"Hinayana\\" Buddhism, which is all too often portrayed as an obsolete, simple-minded form of Buddhism best ignored in favor of Mahayana or Vajrayana systems. This book shows, for example, that the idea of the Bodhisattva was not an invention of Mahayanins and that lovingkindness is at least as important in Hinayana as in Mahayana (see, e.g., the \\"cow's udder\\" reading from the Anguttara Nikaya on pp. 178-79). I cannot think of a better entree into Buddhism than the Buddha's own words, and with Bhikkhu Bodhi's layout of and commentary on these texts, those words really have a chance to shine.
0465043577|2.0|Having really enjoyed Taleb's \\"Fooled by Randomness\\", I thought that Mandelbrot may fill in the gaps that were in that book. The most galring gap being that given more extreme events tend to happen than predicted by the normal (or Gaussian) distrubution, what can one use instead. Disappointly, Mandelbrot only proves a hint of answer.  <br /> <br />He spends much of the book talking about his great achievements (against the odds, of course, )and critiquing the classical tenets of finance theory. The latter is an easy target and most market participants are aware of the critiques. His discussions on fractals was interesting, but the proof of the pudding would whether it works. In the end, he gives some now dated examples of non-classical approaches to trading markets (such as an FX bank using flow information to forecast currencies), though in many cases these approaches do not use fractals or anything he has proposed.  <br /> <br />Bottom line, a useful summary of the critiques of classical finance theory, but don't expect to find anything one case use investing/trading in markets.  <br />
0618680004|5.0|At last someone with scientific credit dares to show in public the intrinsic evil hidden in religion. <br /> <br />It is a quite passionate book, but full of scientific evidence. Perhaps I would have liked comments on Freud works as \\"The future of an illusion\\" or \\"Moises and Monotheism\\" and, in chapter 6, it seems to forget the work of Konrad Lonrenz. <br /> <br />In any case, it is a book that anyone interested in religion, believer or not, must read.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|This is a great season, we have this mysterious and expecting finale, I want to see more...

B000JK8OYU|5.0|I got this CD for Christmas, and I haven't stopped listening to it since.  I love The Beatles and know every song of theirs line for line.  Sir George Martin did a fantastic job on this, and gave a fresh outlook on some of my favorite Beatles songs.  And even the songs that didn't get much of a change just sound great with all the new Pro Tools work on them. <br /> <br />HOWEVER, this CD isn't for the casual music listener or lukewarm Beatles fans.  Many of the songs are changed up, and sound quite different from the original releases.  I really only recommend this for serious Beatle fans that are open to different variations of Beatles' music. <br /> <br />Some awesome tracks to note on this CD are \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" which mixes some \\"Hello Goodbye\\" at the end, which is an absolute pleasure to hear.  \\"Drive My Car/The Word/What You're Doing\\", \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\", and \\"Eleanor Rigby/Julia\\" are awesome as well.  It is a really fun and enjoyable CD, especially for the die-hards.
B000683VI4|5.0|I love this movie, it is such a romantic film, great to watch over and over again! Great when you want to sit down and cry, also great when you want a sweet film about love.
0780626966|5.0|One of the most wanted compilations of all Hollywood horror movies aparears finally in a deluxe set-box which contains the entire filmography around Freddy Krueger. Remastered and packed with its original covers, every film is a savage nightmare that goes exactlly to the centre of our child terrors. \\"Jason versus Freddy\\" is not included.
0618680004|5.0|This is one of the best arguments against religious beliefs that I have read in a long time.  While not philosophically advanced as previous writers, Dawkins successfully lays out why a belief in God or the supernatural is irrational and in many cases, harmful.  I recommend this book to both nonbelievers and those who believe in God.
0452287588|5.0|This book follows Tolle's excellent The Power of Now and further encourages you to realize that you are responsible for your perception of reality.  We have choices that are made as a result of our inner self, the influence of our friends, family and society.  These choices determine whether we are having fun or not.  The universe wants each of us to have fun and we are given the tools to achieve that.  Tolle helps us recognize and use the tools that are right in front of us to accomplish this happiness.  He writes in a very easy candence and is very understandable considering the depth of knowledge he is presenting.
B000G759FS|5.0|The minute you put this cd on you will know you have purchased one of the best of Randy Crawford and Joe Sample. I really enjoy the new version of her RIO DE JANIERO BLUE and her version of All Night LONG. Joe Sample is just awsome on this cd. He really does demonstrate his expert talent. I put this one on when guest come over. When they leave they are on their way to purchase it. They really enjoy the two together. I don't think you will go wrong if you purchase this one.
0201633612|5.0|Good basic reference book for design patterns.  The organization is NOT for reading ease, but for easy reference when you know what you're looking for to be reminded exactly what a particular pattern is all about.  One sentence synopsis--Encapsulate what you expect to change.
B000HWZ4A2|5.0|Ayn Rand is a timeless lesson in personal excellence and the strive for indepence in a world more likely to go with the flow than create it's own path. If you haven't read the book...do so...I live by it! The movie is a nice nutshell reminder of all that should be encompassed in our own individualism.
B00006LFGD|5.0|Awesome collaboration of duets!
B000GFLAI0|4.0|Bob Dylan does it again! With his poetic muse set to an atypical country vs. blues backdrop, he let's it fly.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|I bought 'All the Roadrunning' shortly after it's release along with Bob Dylan's 'These Days'.  I find it hard to put this away to listen to my other music.  How often do you buy a CD where EVERY cut is tremendous?  Mark and EmmyLou's distinctive voices along with these superb arrangements of great lyrics and musical scores make this, in my humble opinion, the CD of 2006!  A must have for any musical collection.
B000005RFQ|5.0|First of all, I'm not a fan of Black Sabbath. I bought this CD because of Ian Gillan. His vocal performance on this album is simply \\"INSANE\\" & \\"IMPOSSIBLE.\\" If you think Gillan was at his prime with Deep Purple MK II, this CD will prove that you are wrong. Sure, Gillan's vocals on many classic Purple songs are legendary (e.g., Child in Time, Blood sucker, No no no, Space Trucking, etc). His vocals on this CD are different: his singing is filled with emotion, anger, bitterness, power and soul. Moreover, Gillan's ultra high screaming vocals on this CD are SCARY and easily surpass what he did with the Purple. If you want to hear the upper limit of a human voice, buy this CD.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|Just a fantastic album. A must have even if not a Dylan Fan
B000FVQLRA|5.0|This is one movie all people should see.  We need to know that survival at any cost has been what have held Jews together.
B000HA4WT8|4.0|Not the most well thought-out developed plot, but the cinematography is great, races are action packed, and the scenes make me wish I had an HDTV.
0393061434|3.0|If this book reflects the real Woz (and I suspect that it does) then both are disappointing.  I was hoping for a detailed rendition of a (technologically) exciting time period, and got a \\"Gee-whiz, Guess What I did Last Summer\\" story from a 5th grader (the grade he went on to teach).  Maybe Woz had to be this person to actually do what he did, but this book does not come off as believable.  I suspect that much is left out. <br />Move it to the juvenile section and place it next to the Jack Armstrong/Tom Swift books.

B000LAZDQA|5.0|Any supposedly straight (as opposed to a soft or hard pornographic film) that begins with a montage of sex scenes featuring both men and women in full disclosure is alright with me.<br /><br />That I was witnessing this montage in a suburban multiplex (ok albeit an \\"art house\\") eating popcorn popped in Canola Oil and sipping a diet Sprite, sitting next to two blue hairs (who promptly exited, only after it might be noted, the completion scenes) only added to the surrealism of the situation.<br /><br />Jamie (played by PJ DeBoy with a hang dog expression and tear welled eyes of which you soon grow weary) begins the film totally nude, filming himself auto fellating but blows the scene by doing just that too early.<br /><br />Jamie is gay and a former street hustler and lives with James (Paul Dawson) in a decidedly one-way relationship: James loves Jamie and Jamie loves himself and says that he \\"feels nothing, nothing at all.\\"<br /><br />Jamie and James consult a sex therapist, Sofia (Sook Yin Lee) for help and guidance and during their first session, Sofia blurts out that she has never had an orgasm.<br /><br />The solution? All three hoof it out to Shortbus: a sort of Plato's Retreat in which all manner of sex is performed in every position by every conceivable combination of men and women. Not all participate, no one is pressured, many just watch pretty much as we in the audience are doing: mouths agape, wondering how did Mitchell get the money to make this movie and more to the point: how did he get it released?<br /><br />Justin Bond (played by himself), manager/chorus master/drum majorette of Shortbus describes and dissects the Club's ethos as \\"like the 60's but with less hope.\\"<br /><br />Director John Cameron Mitchell (the brilliant \\"Hedwig and the Angry Inch\\") wants to titillate of course but he also wants to illuminate. And most of his characters do come out the backdoor better, smarter more self aware than when they entered. Not everything works. Some scenes are awkward and silly but Mitchell infuses the film with energy and social and emotional weight that cannot be denied.<br /><br />Redemption through the cleansing and illuminating properties of Sex?

B000IJ79WU|4.0|I agree with those who felt that the Donner version was lacking as compared to the Lester version. <br /> <br />That said, the difference between the two is SO great, that it is worth it for any fans and filmmakers to own this DVD.  It is very interesting to watch the Donner version after years of living with Lester's.  Sometimes the studio is right and they were in this case.  Donner's Superman II would simply not have done as well in theaters had it been released so many years ago. <br /> <br />That said, I love the DVD.  There's just too much interesting stuff in it, not to own it.
B00008CLOA|5.0|SACD- Sony's recent great idea is quickly going the way of the beta, the el-cassette and various other great ideas that they can't follow through with. Why a company would develop such a fantastic sounding format and then not release their own cd's in the format blows my mind.  And it really burns me up.  I've got over 50 SACD's that will be unplayable when I can't replace my SACD player (it's already happening)!  If you have an SACD player and a decent surround system, get this disc.  It's the ONLY way to listen to Dark Side of the Moon!  But hurry up, for God's sake! I'm already looking for an SACD player to replace mine when it goes.  How anxious am I to go into Blue Ray?  If Sony has anything to do with it count me out.  I can't afford to play their game!
B000HBKCDC|5.0|I have quite a few Christmas CD's that get played year after year and I decided it was time to add some new music to the mix.  I came across this CD during my search for new music and decided to give it a try since I've always loved Sarah's voice.  This CD is so beautiful.  The whole album has sort of a melancholy feel to it, definitely not your typical Christmas album.  But I have to say I loved it so much that I immediately purchased four more copies to send to my sisters and best friend because I thought they would be as moved by the music as I was. This is DEFINITELY my favorite Christmas album. I don't think I'll be able to wait a whole year before hearing it again, so I'm sure I'll be pulling this one out early...
0553801503|5.0|I have to admit .... I hadn't heard of George R.R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire books until about 6 months ago. Being the Harry Potter fan that I am,  I was convinced I was experiencing the best fantasy series out there in the Harry Potter series ... all time best seller in history right ... UH what I found out was that....I WAS SADLY MISTAKEN ...  <br /> <br />Mr. Martin has created with these books THE BEST fantasy series out there ... with alarmingly REAL characters (good, evil, and mixed) in a Machiavellian world of fleeting oaths and alliances, constant war among familial kingdoms, personal vendettas, truly NASTY (both figuratively and literally) ... people (male and female) ... mercenaries, and MAGIC, ...  <br /> <br />Unlike many reviewers of this book, I make no judgments as to a comparison of this book to the previous three ... they are all part of the writer's STORY ... which is the most entertaining, intreguing, and even surprising, and unquestionably captivating fantasy series I've encountered ...  <br /> <br />Don't enter into these stories if you're looking for a light fantasticly fun read ... like the Harry Potter books ... these are darker, more true to life human stories for the time period they are set in ... Medevil Europe ... intricately intertwined with subtrefuge, betrayal, opportunisim, and barbarianism ... incest and cuckoldry (by both males and females) ... of imagined chivalric ideals of human behavior, contrasted with the \\"reality\\" of human behavior during that period ... in short ... a time when life was best described by a famous philosopher of the time as... \\"nasty, brutish, and short.\\" <br /> <br />I'm not writing this review to give a blow-by-blow critique of the author's character development and/or story line development in this book as compared to the other 3, I write this to acknowledge THE BEST fantasy series out there ...  <br /> <br />I have to admit I'm totally captivated by this series ... I learn new things about the stories each time I listen to them.  Oh yeah, I'm a audio junkie so I listened to all of these books... Roy Dotrice did a BRILLIANT performance in the first three books ... truly memorable ... I'm not sure why the reader changed in this 4th book ... I miss Roy ... <br /> <br />I stand corrected. <br /> <br />Just my Opinion. <br /> <br />

B000GPIPT2|5.0|I lived in the era just after this movie was originally released and when I saw this movie when I was a kid it scared the living bejabbers out of me but compared to todays horror movies it is tame in comparison but it brings back old memories and that is why I like this movie.  It is of the same quality as it was originally made and I recommend it to everyone. <br />

It is tame in comparison to todays horror movies but I purchased it because it brought back memories of the past and sometimes it is fun to go back and see what one thinks was scary then.  I recommend this movie to everyone even to todays generation that will probably consider it to be a comedy. <br />

Yes, we have flush toilets, palm pilots and cars, but no men like Leopold.  Great movie for a romantic evening, but it will make husbands feel a bit inadequate and jelaous.  Nobody can compete with a 19th century gentleman, really...<br /><br />Wonderfuly optimistic movie - I wish there were a sequel.
B00011F5DK|5.0|Being a mom, I'm always on the look out for a new form of family entertainment besides TV and movies. I read about this game in a magazine and then saw it demonstrated at a game store. We purchased the game as a family gift for Christmas and it's the best $30 I've spent in a long time. We have have been playing the game over and over, TV time is almost non-existant lately, the kids love the challenge of the game. My 11 and 6 year old caught on right away and my 3 year old is well on his way to being another family Blokus player. We were having so much fun with the game as a family that we brought the game to a New Years Eve party and everyone loved it. I highly suggest this game for all, young and old it's a game of fun and strategy that can be played by 2 or 4 easily.  <br />Two tips: <br />1) Put your game tiles in plastic bags, you don't want to loose any of them  <br />2) Lay the tiles on the table before you play so you can see the tiles you have available to play (don't play them out of the \\"holders\\").

B00005JPDY|4.0|a repeated personal and family sacrificial tragedy, but also a triumph of patriotism. endless manipulations and betrayals. the truth shalt set thee free? yeah, even covert operation still won't avoid others watching over your shoulders. but for national security, now tab into citizens' phone calls and emails are legit just because the potus said he is the law and above the law. those cia guys call themselves the freedom fighters. the ends always justify the means. so in order to declare and claim that you are 110% patriotic, you fly small american flags together with the purple lakers or dodgers banners over the roof of your car windows. putting ribbon stickers on your cars' rear ends to show that you support the troops whole-heartedly, no matter they died in vain for a war that should never had been launched. of course, we citizens are more mature and more reasonable now, 110% different from what we treated our troops during the vietnam war.<br /><br />yeah, we are the good shepherd of the world peace, just like the guy said in the movie:<br /><br />'we always try to keep the war small.'<br /><br />as the potus stubbornly declared again and again: 'no matter how many g.i. died in iraq, still worth it!' he sure is a good shepherd of this country.<br /><br />amen.

B00005JPE7|5.0|this is the best movie i've viewed so far between 2006 and 2007! Sylvester Stallone has again proved himself to be one of the most talented actors and screenwriters. lot of people treated him as a joke as the old rocky balboa, even called him names, steroid junkie and other things. but even they're partly true, with his continued contribution to the movie culture, rockys and first blood/rambo series, he indeed has brought lot of good memories to our lives. sylvester stallone would always be a spiritual figure to me with respect, no matter what.<br /><br />as to this wonderful movie, every and all the ingredients are so good, screenplay, script, dialog, acting, supporting cast, editing and, furthermore, the subtle feather-like sound track as the background music is also one of the best sound tracks i've experienced so far.<br /><br />a wonderful movie to be treasured time and again.<br /><br />thank you, mr. stallone and to rocky balboa also, a larger-than-life but always down-to-earth true hero, a role model ever better created on the screen by stallone for those young men who really want to do some good for their lives.
B0001YRVN4|5.0|I searched and searched for the original movie, for over a month. When I first read about the Trilogy in the product descriptions, it descibed it as Episodes 4, 5 and 6 which really threw me off.   <br /> <br />Then, whenever I searched under Star Wars or Star Wars Episode I, and tried to view the first episode, it showed on the cover art for the video or DVD all these images which I knew were not the original Luke Skywalker and Harrison Ford movie I wanted (that was the first Harrison Ford I ever saw, back as an adolescent in the 70s!).   <br /> <br />Finally my neighbor told me that, some years after we viewed this movie as kids, they named the original one Episode IV, the next two are V and VI.  And later sequals, made as \\"prequels\\", were named I, II and III.  Thanks to her, I found what I was looking for! <br /> <br />To show how confusing this can be for us parents:  When my son told sister what he got for Christmas, she told me SHE too had been searching for the original movie but couldn't find it online; she was so surprised when I told her the original is called episode IV.  This is more than a cooincidence that we were both thrown off by this!  So if you are looking for the wonderful first movie, this is key information: that the original. first movie is called Episode IV.  Something real Star-Wars-Groupies would know, but not us average folks looking for the classic. <br /> <br />Folks at Amazon, you may want to find some way to help people figure that out in their searches, as -- with so much recent Star Wars hype -- many of us parents who enjoyed the movie in our childhood are looking for it for their kids, but not being big \\"Star Wars-heads\\" we are having trouble finding it. <br /> <br />As for rating it, we haven't seen it yet, but any parents will remember that this is wonderful, and will have stood the test of time!  I liked the original stuff much better than later episodes which seemed a bit less fabulous than the first, just my opinion -- that thefirst episodes (again, called 4, 5 and 6) are the greatest!  So we can't wait to watch this triology with our son and daughter.  My daughter thinks she won't like it, given the subject, but I did as a girl, (princess Leiha and all), so I bet she will, tho maybe I only loved it because at the time the effects were soooo amazing to us!

B0000VCZKM|5.0|Dear Amazonians, <br /> <br />I agree fully with the reviewer G. Black, in that Tom Keogh's editorial review of \\"Annie\\" is totally off-the-mark and ridiculous.  There is no way that this presentation of Annie is \\"charmless and dull,\\" I have seen this movie countless times, the first time being when I was about five years old.  I recently purchased the DVD version, and continue to love it just as I always have.  I love the musical performances by the girls in the orphanage, they are so talented!  Oliver Warbuck's character is portrayed wonderfully by Albert Finney, and Carol Burnett steals the show as the wicked and drunk Miss Hannigan.  I give this release five stars, but would like to see Annie released in widescreen format, as a few other reviewers have expressed.  All-in-all, this is a wonderful production of Annie.  Enjoy it! <br /> <br />--Daniel

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I have read Pride and Prejudice.  I have seen the BBC version.  I don't believe this movie is truly either.  This movie takes Jane Austen's book and runs with it.  I'm a huge fan of Austen (I have all of her novels) but I do believe that most (the exception being perhaps Persuasion) lack passion.  I believe that if Jane Austen were alive to see both versions BBC and this one--I think she would like seeing her book on tv (BBC is practically exact)and fall in love with the 2005 remake.

B000J4QWMC|3.0|I had looked forward to seeing thi movie with some anticipation particularly given the glowing customer review which adorns this product.<br /><br />Almost as soon as the DVd started I began to have my doubts with the very dark, almost unreadable writing and the awful sound. My first reaction was to change the brightness of the picture and then the type of sound but neither action resulted in any improvement.<br /><br />I should state at the outset that although I watched the original show in England when it was first broadcast I have no attachment to the particular way it was produced. The world is indeed a much darker place than it was all those years ago and things have certainly changed. That said, I was pleased to see the fast boat introduction to the movie proper underscoring one of the main attractions of the show in the first instance, that being the enormous wealth, juxtaposed against some alarming rates of poverty within the Miami Dade area.<br /><br />From then on it was downhill all the way for me. I could hardly make out what the characters were saying for most of the time, with either the characters themselves or the poor audio tracking being the indeterminate culprit. As for the plot, it was confusing at points and it was sometimes difficule to discern the nature of relationships and even why one was at a particular juncture.  The teaming of Foxx and Farrell for me did not appear to work and the whole romantic involvement between Farrell and Li Gong which appeared to be so spiritual as well as physical dissapeared as in a puff of smoke without any tenderness or attachment on Farrell's part when it was he indeed who had made the running in the pursuit.<br /><br />What could have been a fast moving action drama became something of a lead balloon stretched out for far too long and one was hoping for the end long before it occurred. Clearly it weas set up for a sequel which I hope will not materialise.<br /><br />What was also disappointing for me was the music. Clearly it would be illogical to use the music of the time of the tv show except perhaps for an updated version of the masterful original theme, but to me the music did not match the movie in any sense of the word.<br /><br />Much of the inside shots were of homes where space was not an issue.

B00005MNP7|5.0|I have to admit this was the first Blondie album I owned, why back in 1979, so if there are legitimate grievances of \\"sameness\\" with previous releases, this is the one I heard first so these songs win out. But I think the whining of sameness is rather stupid, Blondie was doing stuff that others weren't, and when you're setting new trends, what else is going to be the consequence? You're going to repeat yourself. Were they supposed to stop and start outputting what everyone else was? They'd be criticized for that. And they have also been accused of being too eclectic and \\"showy\\" with their multi-facetedness. Well boo-frickin'-hoo. I thought this is what albums were supposed to be, ETTB being one of my first, and was sorely disappointed by other offerings by other bands that seemed flat and worn by the end of the 40-odd minutes. If you got it, flaunt it. Being able to pull off 4 genres an album instead of one, go for it. <br /> <br />As for ETTB, it contains what I think is perhaps the best drumming ever recorded. Fierce yet precise, rolling fills that are tasteful and not cliche, pounding, pounding, pounding, but not annoyingly put out there. The drumming carried every song along with it. This album is criticized as being a Parallel lines clone. Well the strategy may have been the same (though see above) but the drumming is much better, both technically and what was mixed onto the tape/master. Clem Burke ought to be a hero of the skins, yet I rarely hear about him. <br /> <br />
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Far and away the best documentary I've seen.  Very informative and scientifically supported explanation of the global warming trend told in simple terms even a middle school student could understand.  And it is interesting to watch!

Not completely. Not comprehensively. Not specifically. Not even if you number all the things you know about his changes and phases and artful phrases.
B000G1ALRK|5.0|Just a great country CD.  From beginning to end it's just great.  The 3 songs I've heard on the radio (How 'Bout You, Two Pink Lines, and Guys Like Me) aren't even close to my favorite songs but are still great songs.   <br /> <br />With a great country anthem like \\"Pledge Allegiance to the Hag\\", a great ballad type song in \\"Sinners Like Me\\" and bunch of other tunes that will all get your toes tapping and your head noddin' like \\"These Boots\\", \\"Can't Take it with you\\" and the goofy soundy yet oddly good finisher \\"Livin' Part of Life\\".   <br /> <br />Would highly recommend people go out and buy this guy's CD.  I haven't liked any CD this much in a long time.  Go buy it now!

B00007LTIB|4.0|I'm a huge Genesis fan and casual Yes listener.  I would say, this is the album that really stunned me the most.  I'd pick it up if you are into progressive rock and give it a listen.  The sounds this configuration of the band creates are just otherworldly. Furthermore, the musicianship is just top notch.  Get it, and oh yeah it's like 3 dollars on itunes for the whole record...  <br /> <br />To be fair though, the audio production on most of these remastered progressive rock records is shotty at best.  They sound almost to warm.  If you don't believe me, go see a band live and then compare them to the record... The records are usually to warm and rubbery, but they have far to much compression on them to really get the feel of great drummers and all the dynamic changes... Case in point: Phil Collins drumming on foxtrot and Selling England By The Pound is just stellar and strong, but on record it just sounds wimpy and muffled.
B000FTWB7G|4.0|After I was disappointed by Anywhere But Home, this reaffirmed my faith in Evanescence. I give the CD 4 instead of 5 stars purely because many of the songs sound similar to one another, but they are great nonetheless.

0151003084|4.0|When I was ten, if I'd read these I would have cackled with demented  pleasure. Our kids & grandkids are too somber & devoid of humor. Or they are so PC that they would be appalled. Of course they have a few little sociopaths in their midst. For them it's too subtle.
B000F39MAQ|5.0|This is one of the most beautiful opera DVDs I have ever seen (I watched more than 100 in 2006). I will not repeat the raving comments other Amazon customers have written about the acting and singing of the three main characters, and Netrebko's electrifying presence on stage. I subscribe to them all. I wish to add however that the austere settings and the choreography are entirely to my taste, no matter how some viewers may suppose that Verdi would have reacted to them. (Verdi was no doubt a first rate musical genius but his overall artistic sensibility may have suffered from the fact that he was born in 1813 in a very small agricultural town of Northern Italy.) In my view, the often repeated complaint that Netrebko's show of physical prowess is incompatible with Violetta's health condition shows a poor understanding of truth in art (in general) and the conventions of opera (in particular): for surely someone about to die of a lung disease cannot sing Violetta's arias in the third act. I can understand that the too obvious representation of time by a large clock (which is the most salient piece of furniture on the scene), and of death by the silent old man (who in the end plays the part of Granvil) may hurt the feelings of conservative viewers. For my part, I found they were both striking theatrical ideas. Also the conversion of the clock into a roulette wheel and finally into a bed or pavement on which Violetta lies postrate while Alfredo rains euro bills on her. I agree that Netrebko's Violetta is more like an ordinary young woman of today than like a mid-19th Parisian courtisan. But isn't this the kind of interpretative freedom that stage directors must exercise if opera is to remain alive? Without it, the staging of opera would retain a purely antiquarian interest. My sole (mild) complaint about this production concerns the rather un-Italian explosive consonants with which Thomas Hampson expresses his indignation at Alfredo's treatment of Violetta (\\"DDi SSPPRRezzo degno, SSe SSTTesso RRende...\\"). It is a pity that the phoneticians who taught him (and so many other contemporary transalpine singers) to master Italian vowels, did not tell him that consonants too --especially initial consonants-- sound differently in Italian than in English or German. (Compare Hampson with Villaz&oacute;n).zo degno, SSe SSTTesso RRende...\\").

B000274THQ|4.0|If nothing else, this is easily the sweetest film ever made about life in the DDR before and after the Berlin Wall came down. Katarin Sass is a heartily loyal party member in 1980's East Germany. A true believer, she rules a family of premature adults - forced to mature when their father fled to the West, never to be heard from again. There are signs of tension between children and mom, but her loyalty to the state provides a safety valve - they can attack her through devotion to the state and obviate more direct lines of assault. As the 80's draw to a close, the GDR's governing regime is already out of steam, and soons grinds to a halt. Seeing one of her kids assaulted during a crackdown on pro-democracy protesters, Mom has a stroke and falls into a coma.  <br /> <br />When she awakes, the Wall has fallen, and her Socialist Police State is no more.  However, the demise of the GDR is a secret kept from her by kids desperate to avoid precipitating another stroke. Instead, with the help of friends, her family manufactures a fantasy in which the GDR is not only still around but (to explain all the reunification hype) the victor of the cold war. (The conspirators create phony news reports using footage of people streaming across the wall - apparently *from* the west, rather than desperately lunging towards it as we'd been led to believe; the formula for Coca-Cola was apparently developed in East Germany.) The effects are actually quite funny - especially when one realizes that the kids have to enlist an ever wider circle to maintain their illusion, making the fantasy GDR more of people's revolution than the \\"real\\" one it replaced. However as the mirage is prolonged - against all odds - the family finds that it must confront the inner demons that GDR deprivation and oppression had bottled up.  <br /> <br />\\"Goodbye Lenin\\" isn't apologia for the East any more than a praise for the triumph of the west. The leads react perfectly with that European deadpan set against the great political upheaval of the early 1990's.  It's a bitingly funny and bittersweet exploration of how common people use political dogma to keep from having to construct real lives and, in this case, have to create fake lives when their dogmas prove illusory.
0786890762|5.0|It has been a while since I read a new book.  Well, it hasn't been that long ago, but for a big reader like I am, a couple of months without reading a new book is a big deal.  I picked up Love, Rosie (previously titled Rosie Dunne and Where Rainbows End) at the airport bookstore on my way to my Christmas vacation.  I couldn't put this book down from the moment I started reading it.  And what a pleasant surprise for me to pick up such an emotive, wonderful story after not reading anything worthwhile for a long time.  In a series of letters, e-mails, IMs and text messages, Love, Rosie tells the story of Rosie and Alex -- best friends since childhood -- and the struggles they face through generations.  We see how their feelings for each other evolve amid growing up, getting married and getting divorced respectively, and finding themselves.  They aren't just best friends; they're also soul mates and love each other like crazy, but something always gets in the way of them getting together.  Will they ever find happiness?<br /><br />I laughed and cried while reading this.  What beautiful writing.  Cecelia Ahern has replaced Marian Keyes as my favorite Irish chick-lit author.  This is beautifully written, which surprises me because Ahern is so young.  (Even though I'm only six years older than the author, I feel kind of old bringing up her age to begin with.)  Anyway, this is a gorgeous story of star-crossed lovers and missed opportunities.  It is mostly told from Rosie's point of view.  The one thing I don't like about the book is the fact that Rosie goes through a lot and sometimes it gets depressing to read. I know what the message of the novel is -- that it is never too late to find success, love and happiness in life, but still.  However, it is lovely that she never loses her spark and sharp wit.  The IM exchanges between her and her friend Ruby are hilarious!  And I loved reading about Rosie and Alex's beautiful friendship expressed in their letters and IM exchanges.  I cried at the end.  I was sad by both the poignancy of the story and because I would miss reading about these wonderful characters.  I cannot recommend this gem enough.  I have long ago waved off chick-lit as frivolous writing about women complaining about being single, badly employed, or being stuck in a bad marriage.  Some of the books are fun, but they become repetitive after a while. However, this book has shown me that I cannot judge all the genre based on some formulaic stuff I have read in the past.  I cannot fathom the bad reviews here.  True, this novel is a little too sentimental at times, but I'm a sucker for this kind of read, and this book is very uplifting.  I so look forward to reading P.S., I Love You, which I heard they are making the film version starring the gorgeous and talented Gerard Butler.  In the meantime, do not hesitate to read this!I cried at the end.  I was sad by both the poignancy of the story and because I would miss reading about these wonderful characters.

B000002KO1|5.0|Released in 1980, the Pretenders' self-titled disc is certainly one of the best debut albums ever released. Although many music fans and critics like to categorize them as a new wave band, this album showed they were so much more. The opening track \\"Precious\\" is as close to punk as the band got and Chrissie Hynde's vocals have so much attitude that it's hard to believe she would sound so soft and tender on the future hits \\"2000 Miles\\" and \\"I'll Stand By You.\\" The tracks \\"The Phone Call\\", \\"Tattooed Love Boys\\", and \\"The Wait\\" are awesome hard rockers full of energy and conviction. As great as all of these songs are, the more melodic material is just as strong. \\"Up The Neck\\", \\"Kid\\", and their cover of the Kinks' \\"Stop Your Sobbing\\" are all great and feature beautiful vocals from Hynde and James Honeyman-Scott's distinctive guitar work that owed more to the 60's pop bands than hard rock. \\"Brass in Pocket\\" would be the band's first hit single and remains one of their most beloved tracks. The songs \\"Private Life\\" and \\"Lovers of Today\\" are also very strong, featuring great arrangements and drama. The instrumental \\"Space Invader\\" would later gain a great deal of exposure in the opening scene of the Sopranos' second season episode, House Arrest. Finally, the band saves the best for last with the bouncy \\"Mystery Achievement\\", an excellent melodic rocker with a cool bass line from Pete Farndon. All told, the Pretenders' debut disc is a timeless album that still sounds great today. Highly recommended to all music fans.
B000002NJS|5.0|This album is truly something else, even though I have nothing but positive things to say about all Madonna's albums. Although her albums always differ from each other (the only similar thing about them is that they all rock), this one takes a whole new direction in a whole new way (techno/electronica). The best tracks on the album are: Drowned World/Substitute for Love, Ray of Light, Skin, Nothing Really Matters, Frozen, and The Power of Goodbye. The sounds are as interesting as the lyrics, and she does new things with her vocals.
B000H7J9RQ|5.0|I had this on vhs tape from the first time it ran on televison and it is still my favorite Barbara concert.  It is fantastic on DVD.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Madonna is incapable of making bad music. All her albums are great from start to finish. It's always hard to just name a few favorite tracks, but here I go: Sorry, Let It Will Be, Push, and Like It Or Not. The beat's are infectious, and the style of her songs is always unique. And I dislike when people pick on her for her voice because I happen to find her voice very appealing. Promise it's not the last album Madonna because music is always better when you're doing it.
B00067BBQE|3.0|I've been wanting to see what Evanescence was like as a live act ever since the first cd, and eagerly purchased Anywhere But Home.  After the first 5 minutes, I realized that (1) I HAD to see them in concert someday <br />(2) Amy Lee is a spellbinding perfomer, & (3) I wanted to strangle the cameraman.  Just where did this guy come from?  He/She apparently thinks that the MTV-style of videos works well for a live concert.  I'm still recovering from the migraine that watching this machine gun-like camerawork gave me.  Take some classes, man!
B00079FUI6|5.0|I didn't start watching this show until recently. I hadn't thought it'd be a show that would hold my interest; I had, mistakingly, thought it'd be another \\"Melrose Place\\" or something like that. Anyway, I caught a little of a rerun on the Lifetime network and was instantly hooked. So, I quickly rented the 1st two seasons on DVD so that I could be all caught up to join the season now in progress. It manages to be funny, even though the subject matter is often dark. And even the selfish/bad characters manage to be somewhat endearing. My favorite character has to be Lynette, trying to deal with all those kids (all those boys, especially). And instead of being annoyed that a mystery takes a whole season to unfold, you're just intrigued by all the new developments.

B000A59PMO|5.0|We began watching Veronica Mars this fall only because it followed one of our favorites, Gilmore Girls.  Within two episodes, we were totally addicted to Veronica Mars.  We purchased the seasons 1 & 2 DVDs to catch up on the series.  This has become our new favorite show! <br /> <br />I must admit, the premise of a teenage sleuth sounds stupid, but Veronica Mars is so smartly written!  It is at once funny, suspenseful, and emotionally-gripping.  If only more things on television were of this high quality! <br /> <br />Watch a few episodes of this show, and I promise you will become a Veronica Mars fanatic too...
1594200823|2.0|This is a truly misbegotten affair. I suppose, in a perfect world, the University of California system would not pay their professors of journalism but require them to predate on coyotes for their food. And write books.<br /><br />This is a nice book, although one wonders how much corn (and soybean) went into its production: the ink, the fibers, the coatings, the transportation to Barnes&Noble -- not to mention all that driving around in the corn fields of Nebraska with Jay and Silent Bob, the two farmers Michael Pollan is pushing to use in his FrontLine screenplay of the book.<br /><br />Once I was shown how Korn has twisted the human condition into a reflection of its own base vegetable needs (although, of course, Korn is not a vegetable!), I began to be grateful that ArcherDanielsMidland had not created a food-based system of antfarms. One imagines the sight of one of these giant industrial antfarms, where once was just benign bovine manure piles, with all of its milking and carrying around of nectar (and the smell!).<br /><br />And, of course, at that point I realized why Michael Pollan needed all those billions and billions of corn kernels. What better way to smuggle his Marxism, then by hiding it under all these kernals? Korn in gasoline?: why, yes, due to the evil machinations of Cargill and Earl Butz. It has nothing to do with replacing MTBE from gasoline. I've had my boogers with Prof Pollan and the family in the convertible; I've made it a quarter-way through this assiduous anecdotalism of a tale; and, yeah, my interest is flagging.<br /><br />I've already seen Roger and Me, so I'm sorry that ADM and Cargill won't help Mikhail with his report to the Central Committee. I try to imagine the FrontLine shots of our owner of calf # 510 driving around with farmers Jay and Silent Bob, discussing yields and winning strategies for tractor pull, and I'm thinking FrontLine won't buy it and film it. That there is some prospect for success for the faculty coyote shoot, of that I'm sure, although I fear a lot of innocent pets and farm dogs are going to die unnecessarily in the execution thereof.<br /><br />I would also have enjoyed a more in-depth discussion of the Earl Butz joke, that it was told on a plane coming back from a conference on hunger in Rome, that it involved shoes, and any other facts that might explain and amplify the evil machinations of this man to impose cheap Korn-based food on the American people.ar a lot of innocent pets and farm dogs are going to die unnecessarily in the execution thereof.

B00005JP9V|5.0|Wow, I just saw this film and I have to say it is the best film I have seen in a long time. The themeatic elements of the film make it hypmotizing, and utterly terrifing. This is a MUST SEE. The cinematography and futuristic overtones remind me much of 12 Monkeys, 1984 and V for Vendetta. If you like thrillers or Sci-Fi than you cant afford to miss this film, it could change your whole prespective.
B0001WTUH6|2.0|If you are looking for a good movie, good storyline, or good scare--look elsewhere.  If you are looking for poor imitations of the Matrix and a bad but pretty actress in skin-tight leather, this is your movie.
B000HEWEE4|4.0|Now granted, most people are going to take this movie at face value and say how over the top and inconceivable it was, but this is truly a beautiful love story, dating back to the days when people communicated and love grew through letters and knowledge of one another.  Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves have such wonderful chemistry and great interaction together that it makes this movie easy to watch and love.  Yes, the impossibility of it is there, but where the magic of the movie is is the story of two people learning each other, interacting through distance, and eventually growing to love one another.  A great movie and love story for years to come.

B0002IQNAG|5.0|This four disc set is the definitive edition of Dawn of the Dead.This is one of the greatest horror movies of all time and certainly the best zombie movie period! The set inculdes three different cuts of the film and a fourth disc with featurettes, cast and crew interviews etc. There is also a mini comic book of DOTD that comes with it as well. Considering the price it's worth every penny even just to enjoy Dawn of the Dead in all it's 5.1 surround sound glory! If you've never seen the film you might just want to buy a cheaper version and not the boxset but if you're like me and love this film then look no further.
B0000047CX|4.0|Perfect for mid-week decompression, that rainy night with a cup of tea or Sunday morning with the Chronicle.
B000005RY7|4.0|This is possibly the best compilation album released by KISS.  Excluding the four new songs, the songs are some of the best.  It's a shame that Strutter wasn't on there.  Also, there were no songs from Hotter Than Hell on the CD.  There's another version that has two other tracks on it.  The other tracks are only available on the band's official website.  The live version of Rock & Roll All Night could've been better, especially since the lyrics were screwed up in the sleeve.
055358202X|4.0|Whether you are a fan of the \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\", don't worry, because you are going to love this book. It maintains the thrill, the interest and the overall quality of the other three books. But, the truth must be the said, you really miss the main characters. That is because in this book Martin depicts essentially the whereabouts in the south of Westeros, and in the next book he will deal with The Wall and The Dragons. But I think that this is only to give us an spectacular \\"A dance with dragons\\", with all our favourite characters together.
B000KJU1MS|3.0|I'd have to say that overall, this is excellent.  Some of the footage is screwed up and some didn't have proper sound, so for this, it loses a few points.  However, this highlights some of the best sounds of the band's entire career.  Get this if you want to see the band in their prime.

0393061434|1.0|Before I list the negative let's start with the positive - Steve Wozniak was integral to Apple's beginning and he's a very smart man and has a great philosophy and outlook on life. <br /> <br />Now for the book. It's pretty bad. A big part of this has to do with the fact that Wozniak wrote it himself. He's incredibly redundant in his nostalgic memories of winning science competitions and being 'pretty sure no other kid in the country had done what I did...' He would have been better off having someone else write it for him. He openly admits in the book that communicating, speaking and writing did not come nearly as easy to him as the logic behind engineering/math/physics. <br /> <br />It would have been great to see some of his schematics behind his 'brilliant' inventions, whether they were from a ham radio he built when he was a kid or a logic board for the Apple II. Take me into your brain Steve! Let me understand the engineering challenges you faced! Instead I feel more like I'm sitting in a rocking chair on a porch talking to my grandpa about the good ol' days. <br /> <br />My other beef with this book is with the title - iWoz. By calling it iWoz he's associating himself with a specific part of the Apple brand that HE HAD NO INFLUENCE ON. It's too much of a stretch to associate himself with the cool factor that rejuvinated Apple in the late 90's. Steve Wozniak is confusing himself with the OTHER Steve - Steve Jobs. <br /> <br />The whole book comes across more like iWAS. Past tense. It's over Steve. <br /> <br />I do believe he could have put out an inspiring book, but there's just way too much ego (about AND and OR gates and using diodes in clever ways) to sift through.
037571457X|4.0|I ordered six copies of this book after I tested it on my class of students learning English as a Second Language (ESL). It has been particularly effective, with the cartoons aiding understanding of the text and helping the students (adults from 11 countries) get past the sometimes difficult vocabulary. They enjoy working with a text for adults rather than some of the pablum that is used in ESL classes. The only shortcoming occurs when some of Satrapi's  sarcasm and irony escapes them, but that can be remedied with classroom discussions, which are themselves a great ESL tool. I definitely plan to use Book 2 when we finish Book 1. <br />Barth, Port Washington, NY
B000683VI4|5.0|One of the greatest love stories ever made.  It is believable and searches the soul, causing the viewer to compare elements of the story to one's own life.  At various points you find yourself saying, \\"That happened to me!\\"
B00005JMFQ|4.0|I don't usually like Hugh Grant, but he does a great job in this movie - very entertaining.
0060776757|5.0|There have been many books written about U2 but what makes this book stand out from all the rest is that it's written in their own words. This book is full of funny stories and forgotten moments as recounted by Adam, Bono, Edge, and Larry. The bond of friendship and family between each band member is very apparent as they poke fun at themselves and each other.The pictures that accompany this book are great and the text gives real insight into the band members as actual people and not just rock Gods.

B0001KL5DA|3.0|The first season of Six Feet Under featured astonishing acting/writing/directing, and was a truly and amazing new show. However, the show began to lag part way into the second season. It lost its witty death related humor, and began to lose the format of the original shows. The decline of the second season culminated in a cliché cliff hanger, typical of shows that don't know how to maintain interest. Season three starts with a confusing premier which includes a massive jump in time that ejects the viewer out of the show, and further illustrates the writers' budding ability NOT to deal with tough issues. By season four the show has fully declined into a rather lame and incongruent night time soap, with the standard love triangles, mystery deaths, and psychics. They have also managed to fully lose their format, that of the beginning death dictating the tone of the show. One of the episodes starts with a death based on an anti-LSD agenda, and after the first scene they completely ignore the issues and the kid who died. I'm pretty sure Fisher Sons and Diaz didn't even embalm the guy. At some point the massive amount of useless sex they have added to the show, and the extended kidnapping episodes become nothing more than unpredictable and uninteresting. If you enjoy the first season of Six Feet Under, quit while you are ahead. However, if you enjoy shows like Alias, Lost, and Days of Our Lives, with their cliff hangers, disjointed action, and love octagons, then i would advise you to PARTY ON!, and enjoy the last few seasons. <br /> <br />BOTTOM LINE: If you are looking for good TV, the kind where pain, humor, and love dance in a similar fashion to life, watch the first season and don't waist time on the rest. If you just love characters no matter how strange they are written, continue by all means; the plot doesn't get worse, just the writing acting and directing. <br /> <br />PORN FACTOR: By season four people are just having random sex, and the story lines seem to bea little better then bottom of the barrel porn. So, i guess, good soft core porn for the win!
0060005696|4.0|If you've ever bought something to keep up with the \\"Joneses,\\" then this book is for you.  Schwartz has a unique argument--that having more choice is making us less happy--and provides many examples to prove his points. Overall, it is an entertaining and enlightening read.  Unlike authors who write on similar topics, Schwartz provides a clear and detailed set of solutions.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that it seemed a little repetitive to me at the beginning.  If you read a lot of books on consumerism in America, you might feel the same way, but it is still worth a read all the way through for the unique ideas in the final half of the book.
B000E1MTYU|5.0|Transfer rate and sound quality are top-notch.  Excellent addition to any HD-DVD collection.

B000EQH2QK|4.0|I purchased the CD for my 16 year old daughter's birthday.  I had seen brief moments of the video -Hips Don't Lie- and I was concerned about sexual content.  But she begged and I eventually caved.  Since then we have purchased three other Shakira CD's and her music is on our -Highly Approved- list.  Finally, something we can both listen to!  The Latin/Rock sound of the album is a fantastic alternative to Rap.  It is fun to listen to, you can dance to it and each song has a completely different mood and tone.  The lyrics are some are the cleanest and most intelligently written I have heard.  The messages in them deal with relationships in an extremely mature fashion.  The Spanish words in some songs and the mild put down to the U.S. in -Timor- actually got my daughter and her friends to talk to us about global perceptions and what other cultures might be like.  Good luck getting that kind of reaction to Beyonce' or 50Cent's work!  In short, I highly recommend this and any other work by Shakira.
B000HCO840|2.0|When I picked this up I did not realize that the only difference that this edition had was the added comic. The comic is a cute concept about Stan Lee meeting X-Men characters, but is not worth the extra money and I doubt that it would ever become a collector's item. I had hoped that there were more extras than that for the added money, but sadly no. So stick with the movie editions.
0060776757|5.0|Excellent!  If you are a U2 fan, this is a must buy!
0811828697|5.0|I bought this book over 5 years ago when it first came out.  I saw it at a local bookstore and had to have it!  If you enjoy speculative zoology -- Dougal Dixon, Wayne Barlowe, \\"The World of Kong\\" (2005)-- then you will definitely want this volume.  Even those who aren't Star Wars fans will appreciate the creative artwork and thought given to creating these fantastic alien environments and creatures.
B000FP2OPY|2.0|A great premise, a bad show. This was given an opportunity to have a great main plot thread (like the aliens in x-files) and also the variety of threats appearing on each different episode. Plus, it would have filled an, unless I am mistaken, otherwise empty niche. But it failed. Why? Well, for sure its not because of lack of presence of the 2 main characters. It was bad directing and bad writing. Shame....
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This movie is slick and fast paced, gritty and action packed.  You do not have to be familiar with the series (firefly) to enjoy this movie, but alot of the character development will be found there.  That aside, a great sci-fi movie for all ages... exciting violence and action without alot of blood... sexual tension and humor with no nudity.... all in all a great action flick with some situational humor that comes off as natural and spontaneous. Serenity ties off the Firefly series in a satisfactory matter. If you are unfamiliar with the series, chances are good you will look for it after seeing this movie. A great addition to any DVD collection.
B000FL7CAK|3.0|Everything about this is average. The plot, the script and the main heroine's acting. Fiction-haters would probably pick this over Buffy, but it would have been their loss. This is too much like having a camera following a regular high school girl through her experiences in life. If that's your cup of tea, you may enjoy this. Otherwise there's much better similar stuff elsewhere. Cough*buffy*cough...
B000HCO83Q|5.0|The story continues to follow classically with Marvel's X-Men universe.  It's dissappointing, however to hear that after the momentum the trilogy has gained, that we may be slowed down by a strictly Wolverine movie.  We've had enough personal background on him, keep the movies about the X-Men coming, not just an X-man.  The DVD is awesomely rounded out though, with great bonus features...it's not too much or too little!
B00080ZG10|4.0|This movie is basically three movies in one - The making of Hell's Angels, Hughes' relationship with Katherine Hepburn, and Hughes' battle with Congress over a law that could have effectively put him out of business, covering the years 1927-1947 in Howard Hughes' life. The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.<br /><br />The first part of the film is actually my favorite, in part because Hughes is young and relatively free from the mental illness that plagues him later in the film, and also in part because it is just plain fun watching young Howard spend three years making \\"Hell's Angels\\". You have a hard time telling where his love of aviation and perfection stop and his OCD begins, and DiCaprio has the I-am-so-rich-I-can-buy-anything-I-want swagger down just right, mixed with the perfect amount of flirtatious charm and lost boy vulnerability. Hughes' hubris is balanced by his right-hand man, Noah Dietrich, solidly played by John C. Reilly, CEO of the Hughes empire for 32 years with only two vacations the entire time, and who lived to be 13 days shy of his 93rd birthday. This part of the movie has some of its most stylish sets and is the most visually appealing part of the film, in my opinion.<br /><br />The second part of the film, which focuses on Hughes' relationship with Katherine Hepburn, is good mainly because Cate Blanchett really steals the show as Hepburn. It is said that Blanchett watched every reel of film she could get her hands on from the 1930's that featured Hepburn, and her preparation shows. At some point you forget this actually ISN'T Hepburn you are watching. My favorite part of this section of the film is when the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound. Frances Conroy of \\"Six Feet Under\\" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.<br /><br />The third part of the film is the most depressing and required the most acting talent from DiCaprio, and he did a stellar job showing Hughes descent into madness. This part of the film starts with Hughes' near-fatal aircraft accident on July 7, 1946, while piloting the experimental U.S. Army spy plane XF-11 over Los Angeles. During his convalescence, the political winds turn against him. Pan American World Airways chief Juan Trippe sought to monopolize international air travel and had influenced Maine Senator Owen Brewster to propose legislation securing Pan Am as the sole American airline allowed to fly overseas, at a time when Hughes planned TWA service to Europe with the Constellation. Brewster in turn, started a Senate investigation of Hughes claiming he had wasted huge quantities of the taxpayers' money and had yet failed to produce any planes. Just prior to the hearings, the film shows Hughes having a complete nervous collapse. He locks himself into one of his film viewing rooms, apparently for weeks, muttering to himself in one of his OCD-induced fogs. He does reclaim his sanity just in time, though, and manages to turn the Senate hearings into an attack on Brewster when he successfully exposed Brewster's dealings with Pan Am.<br /><br />Overall \\"The Aviator\\" is a visually stunning film with great performances by both DiCaprio and Blanchett. I was really pleasantly surprised by DiCaprio's performance, though. His previous outing with director Scorcese in\\"Gangs of New York\\" was such a bad film that I couldn't really judge DiCaprio as an actor. His parts before that basically had him playing male \\"eye candy\\" roles, so, again, I couldn't really judge whether or not that was all he was capable of doing. This movie, however, finally gave him the chance to either shine or fall in a good role in a quality film. I give this movie four instead of five stars only because it is a little too long.a bad film that I couldn't really judge DiCaprio as an actor.

B000HCO83Q|4.0|This is a very entertaining movie, however a lot more work could have been done with the story. I gave the movie 3 stars based simply on the special effects, and 1 star for the story. If you haven't seen the movie, this is definitely a good watch.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This has to be one of the best WW2 movies ever made!  Since it is a series, the story can be developed in a much deeper way.  I also loved that the movie followed Easy Company and had interviews from the actual soldiers.  This movies should be passed down for generations to come!

B0006ZE7G2|5.0|\\"The Wall\\" is a partly animated film with music augmented from the Pink Floyd album of the same name, directed by Alan Parker and animated by Gerald Scarfe. Reflects the band really well, I think. <br /> <br />Bob Geldof plays Pink, a rock star who's burnt out, traumatized by his past and recently divorced. He remembers his childhood, imagines his future and sinks into the metaphors of his head, of walls, of faceless students, of blood and lusty flowers. It's interesting that way, how it all flows, it is like a mix of imagination and memory. It's pretty intense imagery. <br /> <br />Special features include a commentary by Roger Waters and Gerald Scarfe, where they discuss inspirations, memories and the making of the film. There's also a couple of loose music videos, one for \\"Another Brick in the Wall\\" and another for \\"Hey You\\", there's a promotional trailer, a making of documentary, and a couple of galleries of stills and concept art. There's also a few sound effects as Easter eggs.
0307237699|5.0|This is a wonderful book written by a thoughtful man who cares about this country. It is a book about the process of finding answers and the willingness to discuss possibilities. Obama does have his own opinions which he states at various times, but much more emphasis is put on the process of finding answers or possible answers to the problems we face. If we allow ourselves to degenerate - actually we are already there-  into name calling and demonizing and to fall into the trap of winning at all costs we are doomed. I would love to hear intelligent discussions among Obama, Edwards, Clinton, McCain, Guliani and whoever else is around about the issues raised in the book. No screaming or trying to drown out the other person, but intelligent discussion actually designed to find answers. I fight my own cynicism about the possibility that we can still actually go in the direction of openness and honesty and the ability to explore the complexities of todays problems and not fall into the quick sound bites or the litmus tests. Obama reminded me that there is still hope. For how much longer? Who knows.
B00005JPDS|4.0|Usually I try not to find or relate myself to movies, but this one was very touching. \\"The Pursuit Of Happyness\\" (ironically \\"Happiness\\" is mispelled just like in the movie...but the \\"F\\" word was spelled correctly) was an awesome movie to watch. Basically it's about a family who is struggling to get by and accumulated so much debt (parking tickets, fines, taxes, etc.) that they have no where to turn. The father (Will Smith), who sells bone density scanners for a living while the mother (Thandie Newton) works double shifts all in order to pay rent and daycare for their son (played by Jayden Christopher Smith). Eventually they come to some rough times and the mother bails out on the family, leaving the father and son moving from place to place for a place to sleep. I really don't want to give away the movie like some reviewers have. At times, this movie can be very depressing, such as the part where the father and son sleep in the bathroom of a train station. Watching this movie right here, I've learned that life can easily be much worse than it already is, and hopefully I never have to end up on the streets and sleep in public bathrooms. Then ending of the movie is worthwile though. There were some funny parts in the movie though (like the time Chris Gardner ran from the cab without paying fare). You reall have to check this movie out, because it is so inspirational about life. Also I believe lil' Jayden Smith has a promising acting career ahead of him, judging by the way he played his part in the movie. Highly Recommended.
B00004XMV6|5.0|I am a big Micky Rourke fan any way.  This movie just does something for me.  It isn't for everyone.  If sexual content movies bother you, this movie definitely is not for you.
B00005JPCA|3.0|Watching the newest installment of the 007 James Bond series, I felt I got what I paid for. A lot of action scenes and fighting. Most of the acting was on point, especially for Daniel Craig having some big shoes to fill for the fact that the previous parts were played by Ian Flemmings and Roger Moore. It seemed like the big thing missing was the gadgets, not enough of them. That kind of made me a little dissapointed. Also the ending of the movie was kinda loose, leaving me wondering what was going to happen. I don't know if that was intended to be like that or what, but it was just kind of hanging. This is a good movie that is worth checking out. Had many humorous scenes (like the poker table scene), that I enjoyed very much. If you're looking for an action movie, check this out.
0393061434|5.0|I grew up in the same time period and school district as the Woz. I can easily identify with him.
B000GRUS22|4.0|Whereas I have thoroughly enjoyed some Enigma albums, this one appears a little less enthralling than the others. It is in no way a 'bad' album but never really seems to mature as the tracks progress, and often appears to drift. In fact I have been know to skip the last couple of tracks because I simply don't like them very much. <br /> <br />Having said that I do love the bouncy nature of the opening tracks and I have many times restarted the CD just to hear the bubbly synth work. As an ambient album it is great. It's good to work to, and I happily have it on in the car on a mellow morning. <br /> <br />If you've grown up with Enigma over the years and miss the regular injection of the Enigmatic synths then get this album, if you are looking for a first introduction to the music then I recommend picking up one of the earlier works first. I don't regret buying the album but just expected a little more. If I could I'd give it 3 1/2 stars.
B000001ELP|4.0|There's no question that a concept Album does not fit with Kiss. Like every other Kiss fan at the time it came out, I passed on it. Mainly because of being disgusted with the direction they had been going in. Unmasked marked the end of any respect for them at the time. Listening to it recently though, I really like it alot. Kiss themselves aren't fond of the project probably because of the memories of that time. Bottom line is that it was done and is in the catalog and is really a good piece of work. <br /> <br />Just a boy is not a bad song at all for what it is and Odessy has some great Queen like piano to it with nice orchestral arrangements. The 2 part harmony from Paul Stanley is good as well. My favorite songs are Only You which has Beatlesque quality to the vocals and melody with really nice crisp guitar chords. There is a chord change that I love in that song with great Bass lines adding to the sound before it breaks into a Zeppelin style riff. The song runs into the next song Under the Rose which I personally love.  Gene Simmons actually sings without his signature growl on this album and his voice is smooth and nice on this track. The chourus has some great Mid-evilish chant type vocals which sound great. The guitar solo is great, it fits perfectly and has a nice Dave Gilmore/Brian May style delay effect to it. A Dark Light is pretty classic Ace Frehley not the best song on it but not bad...pretty good guitar solo work on it. A World Without Heroes is a nice well written song. <br /> <br />The Oath was definitly a stepping stone to The Creatures of the Night sound. Mr. Blackwell is really nothing to go nuts about but has some tight Zeppelin riffs in it. Escape From The Island is just a Jam pretty much to give Eric Carr his own place on the album. I is alright doesn't really do alot for me. <br /> <br />Basically I like the album alot musically, I enjoy it. I can understand why it wasn't well recieved at the time but it's worth having if you like Kiss. Theonly thing tha bothers me about these later Kiss albums is that there are alot of other players on the songs and not actually the four members of the band. When I learned that fact I felt a little Milli Vanillied but oh well what's done is done.....
B000E1155E|2.0|i feel compelled to write this review because i just read a \\"Top ten albums of 2006\\" list and this LP was #1. i just don't get it. <br />I love the new wave of British rock bands. I visited england in april (2006) and i fell in love with the alt rock scene over there. Kaiser Chiefs and Maximo Park are okay. Art Brut and the Rakes are pretty cool. Editors and especially Dirty Pretty Things are amazing. <br />  The Arctic Monkeys are second rate. they are children and their lyrics and lack of artistry reflect that.   <br />  perhaps the monkeys are getting too much credit over here because they sound so much more exciting than any American pop/rock bands. i don't know. i just know that you really should check out \\"Dirty Pretty Things\\"'s 'waterloo' or \\"Editors\\"'s Interpol-esque 'the back room' before you even think of buying this album.

0618680004|5.0|Dawkins' comprehensive restatement of the case for rejection of supernaturalist beliefs is presented in the eminently readable form that will be expected by those familiar with his writings.  That being said, and despite his earnest plea to believers in the supernatural that they persevere with reading it in order to open their minds to the possibility that they may be wrong, it is unlikely to change any well-established believers.  The massive and compelling evidence against belief is just too great for them to accept, and the most probable reaction will be a closing of the mind, a pulling of the comfort blanket over the head, and resolute determination not to listen. <br /> <br />However, among the great majority of merely nominal believers typical of British society, there may be many who will be prepared to read with an open mind, particularly at this time when religious fundamentalists of Christian, Muslim and other belief systems are becoming more strident in their desire to impose elements their own value systems on the wider public. <br /> <br />This is a most welcome compendium of the arguments for the rationalist world-view.  As footnote, may I mention a much shorter but in many ways complementary book \\"An Intelligent Person's Guide to Atheism\\" by Daniel Harbour published by Duckworth.
B000HA4W4S|4.0|Not as good as the first album...but still pretty good.  If you have a choice, get the version that is in the regular packaging...trying to open this while driving is a pain.
0618680004|5.0|Mr Dawkins is incredible, along with Steven Pinker he must be one of the most passionate intellectuals I've ever had the pleasure of reading and meeting.  He brings such a wealth of knowledge to the subject, while making you laugh with his razor sharp wit.  This book is not superfluous for convinced atheists, rather, it will give you ammunition you didn't know existed to arm yourself against believers.
B00006674X|4.0|This movie does star Elvis Presley.  However, he is really a minor player.  Even my 12 yr old son noticed that much. The movie is about the 60's movement to better the humanity in a neighborhood of racial mixes, young people on drugs, & the Banker - the guy who \\"owns\\" the neighborhood, preys on those just trying to get by.  So we have Sr. Michelle who tries to naively help the troubled youth, Sr. Irene who comes to terms with her ownself as she learns how to beat the Banker & help her people & young Sr. Barbara - the young rebel, who learns how to fight the tough battle while staying in tune with the neighborhood people.  Elvis has the role of Dr John Carpenter, a calm voice in a sea of turmoil. He knows there's trouble in the streets, he's there to help those he can, get involved when necessary & help where he can.  He doesn't have any illusions of being the superhero.  Actually Elvis seems to have walked in off the street onto the movie set he is so lowkeyed.  He appears to be having fun, relaxed & even gets to play football.  He does sing - 4 songs if you include the title track.  One song at the beginning where he & the neighborhood kids are just hanging out & jamming, & one at the end - a gospel song in church.  The one in the middle is the kind of movie song he hated to do - he just bursts into song on a carousel, singing to a small girl trying to get her to smile.  This is one of my favorite Elvis movies, give it a shot.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|A slick and lively production of mostly Celtic and American music. Appearing with the four talented Irish singers, and incredible fiddle player, is a young woman from New Zealand named Hayley Westernra.  IMHO, she brings the production its fifth star.  Her voice is incredibly clear and hauntingly beautiful.  I'm sure they'll sell more copies because of her.   <br /> <br />If you like Celtic music, and well-done standards, it's a good bet you'll enjoy this DVD.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Nausicaa is the first original full length animation film Miyazaki did. Back then, Studio Ghibli wasn't even a viable business. I am a terminal case addict for all Miyazaki/Ghibli films, but this is the one made me that way. The story so original, so powerful, and the graphics so stunning, accompanied by such beautiful music by Joe Hisaishi, no one ever produced something like Nausicaa, ever. Animation or live action. <br />In my humble opinion, not even Miyazaki himself surpassed this great work. <br />Yes, I love Spirited Away, Porco Rosso, Princess Mononoke, Castle in the Sky, Howl's Moving Castle, Totoro (though English version could use some work) and the like, this is still my unflenching number one choice. <br />What's even more stunning about this story is that the film features only 1/3 of the whole epic saga of princess Nausicaa. When he propose this full length animation film, the movie studio blasted at him, that how can they invest on such project when it doesn't even have an original story. So Miyazaki wrote the original epic saga featuring the kite flying princess. Only the first 1/3 made it to the movie. Now that the maestro is retired, there is no hope that the rest of the story will ever be made to the silver screen, but the English translated version of the books (there are six volumes) are released in the U.S. <br />If you watch this, and loved the story, you should get the book, too.
B000G8NY4U|5.0|Yanni show all his sensitive music combined with a very good orchestra. The Concert Event is a very good show for the soul.
B00000373U|1.0|I purchased the cd because of the posted reviews.  Those reviewers obviously liked the self centered, self indulgent, depressed, simplistic lyrics.  It seemed to droan on and on for ever....It wasn't worth the time.   <br />Sorry---I'm over 30 and am not interested.
B000H0MKOC|5.0|My friends all told me this movie was really good, so when it came around on DVD, I was looking forward to it.  I thought it was well cast, and refreshing in that it made you think.  The lead character is a lobbyist for the tobacco industry, and boy is he a talker.  A funny, enjoyable look into the world of spin...
B000H7JD4K|4.0|Good album.  But a little different.  This is definitely something that most Maiden fans I've talked to don't really dig on the first listen through.  It's immediately better than their previous outing (Dance of Death), but there are some structural differences. <br /> <br />Overall one could make the observation that the album has a bit more of a progressive feel to it, though I certainly wouldn't label it a progressive album.  Here and there the album has shades of A Brave New World but it's definitely it's own beast on the high majority. <br /> <br />If you're a Maiden fan through and through, pick it up and give it several listens before you make a judgement.  The difference in sound from an 80's Maiden album unseated me a bit at first, but on the whole I hold this album in high regard. <br /> <br />The first half of the album is certainly better than the first.  Considering how much the band enjoyed the creative process (this is definitely their most mature and complex album to date), this may be their sound for some time to come.
B000GIXEIG|5.0|This is a classic adventure of a Scandinavian hero. He battles good and evil in his quest to help a faltering fatherly king who has not told him the complete truth. Within all the blood and gore there is humor. You cannot help yourself to laugh out loud at the scene where Beowulf first confronts Grendel. This great hero is taunted and pelted with rocks by a troll. There is great acting by Gerald Butler, who demonstrates what an outstanding asset he is to the profession. This is quality entertainment.
B00011RPB0|4.0|I read a few of the reviews already given for this movie. Those who are young, who have a lot of life yet to experienc will not identify with the main character of this movie. The movie will seem to flow slowly with no real interest other than the sort of fast life protrayed in the city of Tokyo.  <br /> <br />In actual fact, if one is about the age of Bill Murray, one can identify with his character and find a lot more meaning in this movie. The movie then flows, it is interesting, it has more meaning.  <br /> <br />I gave this movie 4 stars instead of 5 only because I wanted more from the movie. Murray very well protrayed his frustration, his lonliness in life with his eyes, his expressions, his demeanor. I felt that if he had talked with Charlotte more, talked about his life vs hers - why did he feel ennui, feel lonely, out of touch even in a crowed room. This greater interplay might have made this movie more intesting to people of all ages.  <br /> <br />There were many touching moments in this movie. When Murray carried Charlotte to bed after their first foray into Tokyo, you could tell she felt \\"safe\\" in his arms, as if she was in her father's arms. It was a very touching scene to me. Murray was caught between his role as a father and his growing love for her. He opted for the role as father, which said a lot for his character. There were two types of love there for all to see - a father's love for a daughter, and a man's love for a woman. Both were there at the same time.  <br /> <br />Later they were in bed together discussing a lot of issues. He tried to help her see life in a positive way and he helped her. Now at this point it would have been appropriate for him to be more open with her to discuss his life, it would have been a more powerful moment. I believe just a few minutes of dialogue would have sufficed at this point to create a greater frission that was already developed between these two lost people. At this end of this scene the audience is givena view of her lying next to him, her feet pressed against his leg. His right hand moves from beside him to touch her feet. It was a touching moment. Here again the father/daughter/potential lovers dual relationship is even more evident. Once more his role as father wins over the supposedly normal \\"male takes what is offered\\" role. He knows who he is, and this knowledge is what creates his lonliness.  <br /> <br />The scene in which he has taken the red-headed singer to bed, after they met the previous night in the bar, and then Charlotte knocks on his door the following morning, encountering the fact that he has had company for the night, detracts somewhat from the love that was growing between these disparate people. Yet this defines that the weakness was always there, the need to exorcise lonliness, but it was not done with Charlotte. This too is telling of his character. <br /> <br />The final moment, the tender goodbye was the best moment. He finally kisses her, and he kisses her on the lips, then on the cheek. You can almost feel the younger man inside him has come out and replaced the older face, the older arms and hands, the older body for just a moment. He was there, this younger person. Then he said goodbye, for unlike what the younger male might have and could have done, the older mind in the young male kept his place, kept things as they could only have turned out.  <br /> <br />Hearts can reach out from another place and give love. This happens every day when we go to work after we say goodbye in the morning to the wife and kids. They are with us all day. Then too, I believe that hearts can reach out from another time and give love. It is a sadder love, but love nonetheless.  <br /> <br />Joe
B000G0O5N2|5.0|There's a few movies I will probably never get tired of watching.  Pitch Black, Ghost Dog -- Way of the Samurai, Mary Poppins, Firworks, Equilibrium...and Black Hawk Down. <br /> <br />There are movies that either touch something in you or don't.  The movies I listed are all those that find something you either wish you had or you have at your best and enjoy seeing well done on film.  Black Hawk Down is one of those.
B000059H98|5.0|awesome.  this came quickly and without problems.  as it was said, the movie was in perfect condition.
0743298020|1.0|I did not enjoy this book at all, if dysfunctional families is your bag, you will love it.  This is the kind of book that when you finish reading it you wonder why you bothered.
B000GG4XJM|4.0|Not the kid of music you would normally expect from the Boss. I listened to it a few times now. And I must say, I'm getting used to it. The tunes are quite catchy. Still I hope the next album will be a E-Street album like Born in the USA or The Rising
B0000AQS6R|4.0|This isn't the best 'Vacation' by a long shot, but it is still as funny. In fact, it could be the funniest Christmas movie ever.
B00000IL1K|5.0|I love this woman.  I've not found a less than fabulous album yet.
B0006GAI6O|5.0|The acting is this movie is wonderful and so are the elaborate and beautifully choreographed dance numbers. <br /> <br />The story behind the entire movie is really heart warming and renews your faith in the fact that not everything that is broken has to stay that way.  It can be fixed and return to an even better state. <br /> <br />The music is phenomenal.  I even ordered the soundtrack.
B000683VI4|5.0|I've owned this movie since the release date; this was a gift for my 15-year-old granddaughter who loves the movie as much as I do.  I've watched it several times.
0618680004|5.0|I found The God Delusion very interesting and in some places I could barely put the book down, but I did not find everything I had hoped for. <br />Rarely, some of Mr Dawkins arguments are perhaps not entirely on target. That said almost all of his arguments are on target and it makes for a thoroughly enjoyable/amusing/tragic read. <br /> <br />I'm very glad I bought the book and will be enthusiastically lending it to friends and family. <br /> <br />One last thought... Mr Dawkins does give the stark critique to Agnostics with his finger pointing and dismissive sitting on the fence stance. I would tend to disagree and simply state that Agnostics as defined by the dictionary take the stance the Religion by it's very nature cannot be proven to be false (it's all about faith...). With this in mind we should look back in history and see the points where science has stated categorically that this is the way things are - it's proven! All I mean to say is that we have barely scratched the surface of our understanding of the universe. We know next to nothing about ourselves let alone everything else around us so my stance (personally) would be to agree that the \\"evidence\\" does tend to support one conclusion over another but always keep an open mind. <br /> <br />By the way, in case I wasn't very clear in the above ranting, I loved the book and would readily recommend it anyone interested in theology. <br />
B000007T2Z|5.0|(4.5 stars)<br /><br />Dead Flag Blues is worth the (rather expensive) price of this cd alone. The other tracks are beautifull instramentals, theres a little spoken piece in their but it's more like a sample then lyrics. The first track is the most moving thing i've ever heard. Like the blues, it paradoxally makes me feel better.  It must be heard to be believed.
B00005JPDS|5.0|One of the best movies I've seen in an awful long time. It reminded me of a couple of my all-time movie favorites \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\" & Gary Cooper's \\"Meet John Doe\\". Movies with real heart and soul. I can't say enough good things about this movie. Easy, very easy 5 stars!
0060776757|5.0|I have been a fan of the band U2 for over 20 years.  I have purchased several books on the band in the past, however, none compare to this book written by the band themselves.  A complete retrospective of there career from the very beginning to there most recent release, \\"How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb\\" and Vertigo tour.  If you are a fan of U2 as I am you have to have this book in your collection!

0307237699|5.0|Above all, `The Audacity of Hope' gives us hope. Whereas only the churchgoer has his faith, Obama gives each one of us, hope. Not only for some of us, but for all of us. I see his counterpart in the world of religion, the 33 day pope who was also a monumental progressive (Lucien Gregoire's \\"Murder in the Vatican: The Revolutionary Life of John Paul\\"). When John Paul 1st died, my hope for a more just church and a better world died with him. In my mind, Obama brings him back to life. What this pope, had he lived, would have accomplished through his church, Obama is now poised to accomplish through the state. He will bring us into a better world. Let's read his books and learn from him. Let us become a part of him.
B000HCO8IQ|4.0|This is another brilliant album from the group, i have listened to the album most days since buying it, it's great even my husband likes it.  They have some really upbeat songs to sing and dance along to, well worth it.  Can't wait for the next one, BRING IT ON !!!
B00006CXSS|5.0|It's as good if not better than \\"Saving Private Ryan\\", which I thought was also excellent.  Band of Bros. doesn't have the theatrics that Hollywood loves to put in most of its military movies.  It's not a romance like the recent \\"Pearl Harbor\\".  It's taken from true accounts of the surviving members of Easy Company (who are interviewed on the dvd).  It a 'must see' for people who want see World War II drama from a much more realistic point-of-view.
0143034901|5.0|one of the best fiction I have ever read recently. I was unable to put it down. There is a bit of unrealism in the book. however, the plot is set so that you really want to find out what happened to the characters.
0393061434|3.0|The overall tone and writing of this book in my opinion is pretty sub-standard. I was distracted by the fact that we have this absolute genius here giving us back stories, and the writing was quite poor.<br /><br />You get an honest account of Woz's life in this book, and after about 1/2 way through, things get much more interesting and the writing improves significantly.<br /><br />Any fan of Apple, Woz, or technology in general should purchase and read this book. I just expected the writing to be more succinct.
6304779356|5.0|The Last Fire Will Rise<br /><br />Behind Those Eyes<br /><br />Black House Will Rock<br /><br />Blind Boys don't lie.<br /><br />The Lost boys starring Kiefer Sutherland, Dianne Wiest, Jason Patric, Both Coreys, That guy from Bill and Ted, Billy Wirth, Edward Herrman, and Jamie Gertz in her one and only good role. Directed by Joel Schumacher (who also directed Falling down, Flatliners, Flawless, and Tiger land to name a few). I have watched this movie about 100+ times, about 90 of those viewings were between the ages of 14-16. I had the movie poster, I had the t-shirt, I had the soundtrack, and I had an abundance of teenage love for Kiefer Sutherland that only his giant forehead and perfect skin could quench. Before this movie the only thing I had seen him in was Stand by Me, his evil grin and penchant to play bad boys didn't sway my methodic worship of his charms. He can play bad very well.<br /><br />This movie has a simple premise. Two boys move to a small town from a big town, the older one (Michael) meets a beautiful girl (star) but she is in a local gang. He wants her so badly he will do anything, including letting the leader of the gang (David) manipulate him into joining them. The twist being the girl is a vampire, and now Michael has to find and kill the head blood sucker in order to save himself and his chick. Throw in the mother, motorcycles, dogs, and rock concerts and it's a hit. Corey Haim plays the younger brother Sam, and he is completely gay. Seriously. Even in the 80's with all of its neon colors and unisexual celebration, no boy of that age had a half naked poster of Rob Lowe in his room. Sam and his cohorts the ever present other half Corey Feldman who plays Edgar Frog, and some dude who we never ever see again, become vampire hinters following a horror comic as a guide. They fight, and ultimately triumph against the children of the night, and their hilarious vampire master (funny only because the makeup they use on him is bordering on ridiculous)<br /><br />Some might look at The Lost Boys and see serious hairspray and cheese, but look closer and you will see an almost Shakespearean tale of brothers, family, loyalty and love. The soundtrack which features such artists as INXS, Echo and the Bunnymen smoothly carries the mood of the film brilliantly. Kiefer obviously steals the show, with Jason Patric coming a close second, although both the Coreys over the top acting is fun to watch always. Dianne Wiest will always be \\"mom\\" to me because of this movie, and although Billy Wirth never really got another big role his screaming rock star death is one the best kill scenes in any movie.  The makeup is awesome for its time, the acting is over the top but entertaining, and the entire package is a girls dream come true, its akin to playgirl with fangs for me. Love it.> <br />Some might look at The Lost Boys and see serious hairspray and cheese, but look closer and you will see an almost Shakespearean tale of brothers, family, loyalty and love.

B000F8O35U|5.0|I loved this movie as a kid and, I wanted my younger relatives to be able to watch it also.  Great movie, especially, for girls to watch.
1842157051|4.0|I love doing pop-up cards and this is a good place to begin. It shows how extra creative that you can be beyond what you think an ordinary pop-up card normally is. Very different ways to do pop-up cards.
B000GFLAI0|4.0|I liked this album as much as \\"Time Out Of Mind\\" which is a big compliment...this album is lighter and happier that the bluesy tracks on \\"Time Out Of Mind\\" and reflects a brighter honest side of Mr. Dylan.
B000H5U832|5.0|This is a great movie with a wonderful story!<br /><br />My three year old daughter loves it!
B00007GZQI|4.0|Peter Sellers and Ringo Starr are brilliant in this series of lurid and comic episodes that are woven together by this simple premise: people will do anything for money - just name their price! Loaded with cameos, spotting all the personalities that contributed to this comic gem is half the fun. Anyone who enjoys late 60's/early 70's counterculture comedy should own this movie.
B000AP04NI|5.0|This is the musical which best portrays middle, pioneering America.  This rates right up there with Porgy and Bess, West Side Story and South Pacific.  The storyline is timeless and the anniversary edition was done so well that you are right there in the scene with the cast.
B00005JO9J|5.0|I only saw a few episodes of Grey's Anatomy on the actual t.v. however, I fell in love with it and now own the movie. There are a lot fewer episodes on this then I expected but it was really cool to be able to see the show from the begining.
B00005MP58|1.0|I have this same product on VHS tape.  I purchased the DVD version to avoid having to switch tapes while viewing and to save shelf space.  The VHS tapes have warner colors and are overall more pleasing to watch.  The remastered digital product is washed out in appearance and destroyed the warmth.  I would not recommend the DVD.
B0000542D2|5.0|Wonderful movie.  If you love the Beatles you will love this.
B000F2C87Q|5.0|I'm very proud of the boys for putting this one out. It's a fitting tribute. Dan's love of Junior is real, and the result is a perfect blending of Junior and the Black Keys. If you ever spent a night at Junior's Juke Joint, in Chulahoma, then you know the meaning of psychadelic soul; and the boys captured that feeling perfectly. The music is primitive, hypnotic and sexual. If you want the same old, worn out 12 bar blues, don't buy this cd. If you want honest, raw and deeply felt blues, buy this cd, and another one by Junior himself. This music comes with the seal of approval from Junior's widow, Mildred. You can't get any higher praise than that. I have strong feelings about this one. I wish more musicians would try to pay back the elders who inspired them. Hat's off to Dan and Pat!!
0307237699|4.0|So, my neighbour is looking for someone she can stand as president the next go-round. She expressed some interest and I sent her this.<br /><br />I have not read it myself. However, she seems pretty impressed. If it's Clinton or Obama, then I think she'll go for him.<br /><br />It's all hopeless as far as I'm concerned unless they can reanimate Joey Ramone. Yay! Zombie Joey Ramone for leader of the \\"free\\" world.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|great movie and very good item since all extra movies and cinematografy is excellent
B0000025T6|5.0|As a child of the 80's I grew up on \\"Born in the USA\\" Listening to that always soothes me. So, when I came across this in my early twenties, I was thrilled. It is so dark and beautiful. Can't say I totally dig the whole album, but the songs on here that are good are so amazingly, insanely good. Now, Mum and I are enjoying the Seeger sessions - she even got in to see them in concert - that lucky lady!
B000G8NY4U|5.0|I am the fan of Yanni , I owned the other 2 previuos Yanni concerts , all of them are very good on video and audio , also the music composed and arrangement  and the back ground of stage are up to date the technology . Very good the concerts
B000002J6H|5.0|What a group of friends to have to put together a rock and roll album with. Appearing in no particular order are Mama Cass Eliot, Jimi Hendrix, Booker T Jones, John Sebastian, David Crosby, Rita Coolidge, Eric Clapton, and Graham Nash. Hokey smokes Rocky, and two of the songs are solo efforts by Stills. An amazing album that covers many corners of the rock and roll spectrum. A must have for guitar nuts as Eric, Jimi, and Steve all lay down some great licks. Enjoy this one for a long time :)
B000B7BRMM|5.0|I love this cd it is the best christmas cd I have ever owned. I am a big fan of Diana Krall and I think she did wonderful on this cd. I would recommend it highly to everyone.
B0000DZ3EA|4.0|I am a Peter Gabriel fan, good music, If they put all the songs that were great on 1 cd or even 2 thier will be little money to be made.  <br />I listen and enjoy this set.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|This cd is one of the best pink floyd dvd the music was great and the effects were awesome it was almost like being there. I am a big fan of floyd and I highly recommend this dvd its fantastic. It had alot of the songs from the dark side of the moon which is my favorite cd. I throughly enjoyed it and I know you will to if you are a big fan like me.
B000024D4R|5.0|I listened to this a lot in the hospital at night. I think this is my fav. CD. I don't think it gets better than that I have 2
B000JLTRKE|3.0|Wasn't really a good movie as I expected more about the trade center. Moved to slow for me.
B00003CXAA|5.0|This is a timeless DVD for anyone's collection.  It appeals to all generations and will always be popular.  I have given it for gifts (besides a copy to myself), and it has been really appreciated by all. <br />To me, this is a must have for anyone's DVD collection.
B000F7CMRM|3.0|Have not watched movie yet but doesn't sound to great. Not to crazy about George Clooney but my husban likes him
B000I0RNVG|5.0|Quite extraordinary! I am glad I had closure! It was good to see that Toto finally got the girl, and the girl got Toto.  I was kind of mad at Alfredo, but in the end it was good because the story could have change a lot if he had spoken.  This is an exquisite movie, the kind is very rarely made anymore.  I so enjoyed the extra time in the movie, but I still adore the ending it always surprises me, don't know why.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Greatest DVD out. Love their group. Won't loan this DVD to anyone else. Have always loved Pink Floyd.
B00008972S|5.0|Absolutely awesome.  The DVD picture is flawless. The story is as it always has been, at least for me, heart wrecking, but very refreshing as to how this sort of discrimination has not ended, and I think it never will. I always cry and get angry with Maria (I am from a latin country) The history of the movie and the pictures are great. I am glad this special edition came out. I will treasure it forever. <br />
B000GIXEIG|5.0|Great acting as I love Gerald Butler but I don't really no to much about what was going on in the movie. Great acting.
B000026C1Q|4.0|I love The Alan Parsons Project's music. Their themes always teach me something.  I think I have all of their albums. I've been replacing my old LPs.  This particular cd to me is not as good as all the others.  The instrumentation is a bit different.  I guess I need to listen to it a few more times to understand it, but if it is Alan Parsons, I will always buy it.  Love them!
B000002LUB|5.0|Being a longtime fan I have followed Black Sabbath's roller coaster ride of a career since 1976.While i prefer the Ozzy era i do like the Dio era almost equally as well.In my opinion Dehumanizer is the best of all Dio era Albums.It is brutally heavy-In fact one of the heaviest albums ever recorded by Black Sabbath.A must for any Black Sabbath Fan!
B000H5U832|4.0|This is another great movie by Disney.  The story and characters are great for kids and there is also some humor for adults.
B000H4JGZY|4.0|This is a great CD for the dance scene. Some of the songs remind me of JT's days with N'Sync - they have the N'Sync \\"sound\\", however, songs like Sexyback are unique and you can't help but want to dance to it. An essential for the dance collector's library!
B000HEWEE4|5.0|This is a great movie! I am so glad we own a copy.
B00001OH7V|5.0|Listen.  This is Bowie's greatest work, though I would put Outside up there as an unrecognized classic, as well as his soundtrack for The Buddha of Suburbia. And we can all go back to all the other records, because they are all pretty much in the \\"excellent\\" category.   Station to Station.  Low.   Ziggy.  My favorite:  Aladin Sane.  The list just goes on and on.  His recent work is contemplative and worldly beautiful.  There isn't a bad record in his catalog.   Compare his work with anybody, anybody working now in any similar genre.  Sad how far we've fallen.   Sad how farther we will fall. <br /> <br />The inclusion of noise in various pieces here has been done in classical music since the the 1920's with musique concrete, so it should not bother anyone born after, say 1890 or so.  I doubt that anyone online was born at that time.  I may be wrong.   Souls transmigrate, and some of them don't get it even the after hundreds of such transmigrations.  Back to the karma pool.  Oh, well. <br /> <br />Every piece on this record is amazing, and the preceding reviews note that spectacularly.   I won't repeat the praise.   I just want to note that the cricicism of this record is a little skewed.  Few pieces of art are as timeless as this record.  A new fan may not take to it immediately, but with a few listens, will become transformed, much as the lovers in the title track, which, incidentally, is available, sung in German.    The German language version actually cuts the English one, it was meant to be sung in German, in which the angst finds its ultimate home, but avoid the French language version.  French is a great language for pop, but not for rock and roll.    <br /> <br />A superior album for the ages.   Required listening and ownership. <br /> <br />
0452287588|4.0|This builds on the content of the Power of Now and Stillness Speaks but gives a context for the messages from these books.  There is great comfort and hope from A New Earth in its messages.  This book gives the theory but also practical suggestions in how to apply its messages to your own life and how to wake up and live now.  Very powerful.  I also listened to this book on CD and found that medium to be an interesting alternative.
0618680004|1.0|This review addresses empirical issues in Dawkins' work, not its philosophical issues. <br /> <br />Dawkins has built a career by championing science, but in recent years he has increasingly turned his attention to religion, and in doing so he seems to have abandoned all respect for empirical research.  There is an *enormous* empirical literature on religion, but you wouldn't know it from Dawkins' treatment.  Dawkins ideas about religion seem to be mainly popular Western ideas, and include notions that no anthropologist or psychologist studying religion empirically would regard as accurate.  If Dawkins is writing about religion, he is writing about some form of religion that is exceedingly rare among human beings.  What is remarkable is that Dawkins does not seem to know it.  I'm not surprised when lay philosophers write about religion without knowing much about it, but I am surprised when a champion of science chooses to ignore empirical inquiry.
B000HA4WTI|4.0|Movie arrived in a very timey manner. My son loves it and has watched it over and over again! This is the best way that I have found to purchase movies.
0743298020|5.0|Diane Setterfield's novel, \\"The Thirteenth Tale,\\" is one of those fantastic page-turners that I was unable to put down. The story unfolds as Margaret Lea, the daughter of a London bookseller, is summoned to the home of Vida Winter, England's most famous (and mysterious) living writer. Margaret and Vida have never met before, so it comes as a huge surprise when Vida commissions Margaret to document her life story, which has been a closely guarded secret for many years.<br /><br />As Vida slowly shares her story with Margaret, readers jump back and forth between past and present settings. Margaret learns about the lives of twin sisters Adeline and Emmeline and their troubled family history. As she gathers more information, Margaret does some detective work of her own and ultimately journeys to the ruins of Angelfield, the remains of Vida's childhood home. Certain mysteries are solved, but many more questions arise. Setterfield keeps readers guessing until the very end of this intriguing and suspenseful ghost story.<br /><br />I don't want to give away any other details of the plot. This book is chock full of secrets and surprises that will draw you into the story from the very beginning. Although this is a ghost story of sorts, it isn't as spooky as something like \\"Dracula,\\" so don't expect to be plagued by nightmares. \\"The Thirteenth Tale\\" is expertly written, and it's one of the best books I've read in a long time. Pick up a copy as soon as you can...you will not be disappointed!
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|The movie was in good shape as delivered, and the quality of the disk is excellent.
1592401791|5.0|This book gives insight rarely available. Details on the recording procedure, not just Bealtle cliches. The only drawback is, Emerick is obviously a Paul admire and has ill feelings for George, not passing any opportunity to criticize a very creative guitarist. Makes also Ringo seem at times pathetic. All in  all, from a musician's and a fan's point of view, a MUST have.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|I love Sara's music ans wasn't dissappointed.  The songs that were oldies but goodies had a fresh and contemporary sound with I loved.  It is a great CD even for after the holidays, you never get tired of good music.  Arrived fast and packaged wee as always, thanks Amazon!!
B0002HMQUS|5.0|I had a lesser brand of mono pod. The ball bearings on the smaller sections were so hard to keep extended. When I wanted to wanted to capture them inside of the larger parts of the shaft, it pinched my fingers, the Bogen is a terrific solution to this and much more sturdy.  It has snap/Flip locks to keep the monopod extended and make it easy to collapse.    I take a lot of outdoor action sports shots, and it makes taking the actions shots so much more easier, especially with a long lens and shooting sessions that last for several hours.  The price on Amazon was great also, it was easy to find the lower price and compare prices versus prices and shipping and handling fees.  A great addition for any photographer that wants steady clear shots.
0743454529|5.0|You are in for a treat.  After I read this book. I ordered two for my sisters.  I loved it, it made me laugh and cry.  Great escape, her best book yet!!
B00000G3AZ|5.0|This is a delightful presentation of Jane Austens classic novel. <br />It is well cast, well acted, and fun.  Austen's low-key sense of humor comes shining through, as does the beauty of the English countryside.
B000FVGMC4|5.0|I first saw Paolo Nutini on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson a few months ago, and he struck me. I made a note to remember his name, and went out to try and find his CD and realized it wasn't released. Finally I ordered it here on Amazon, not wanting to wait until January 30th for its US release. Every track is great.  <br /> <br />Paolo has a great voice that has a unique quality about it. It isn't smooth sounding, but is beautiful. You can feel the passion when he sings. The CD contains a good variety of different songs, including your slow, muted tunes and songs that have me tapping my feet.  <br /> <br />I have also watched live recordings from concerts Paolo has performed at and he has proven that he put on a great show. I look forward to hopefully seeing him in concert one day. He seems to have gained a lot of popularity in the UK, and I am willing to wager he will make his mark in the US as well. If he's only 19 and already as good as he is, I imagine he will produce more great music in the future.
B0009IOR6Q|4.0|Having no idea what to expect, this movie was just plain weird!  Didn't know Depp could do what he does in this film.  If you're looking for a \\"Grease\\" look-alike, this one is definitely one to try for something different!
B000EQ47GS|5.0|This album is truly one of rock'n'roll's greatest.  Produced almost single-handedly by Tom Scholz, in a home-brew basement studio, it broke upon the disco-drenched music scene of 1976 like a tidal wave.  Indeed, the sound was unlike anything which had come before it; so different in fact that, when I first heard it, I didn't like it a bit.  However, I gave the music a chance and, within a month, it had made an indelible impression on me and joined my short list of favorite albums which, at that time, included, the Moody Blues \\"Sacred Seven albums\\", the Eagles' \\"Desperado\\", Derek and the Dominoes' \\"Layla and Other Love Songs\\", the Jefferson Airplane's \\"Surrealistic Pillow\\" and CCR's \\"Green River\\" and \\"Cosmo's Factory\\", none of which sounded anything like what Tom Scholz had turned out with Boston.<br /><br /> To this day I find it difficult to describe what it is about Boston's music that makes it so unique.  Yes, it's hard-driving, but that describes the music of a lot of other groups before and since, Uriah Heep, Deep Purple, and Nazareth all come to mind.  It is wonderfully melodic and showed that rock could be as complex as classical music, but so was the music being turned out by Uriah Heep, particularly \\"Salisbury\\", \\"Demons and Wizards\\", and \\"Magician's Birthday\\", along with others such as Queen.  It has a depth of texture that very few bands of the period achieved, the only real contenders in that area being Uriah Heep and Queen.  I suppose that, all things considered, it is the manner in which Tom Scholz brought all of these elements together, combined with Brad Delp's incomparable vocals, and the lyrics that spoke to a young romantic's heart, that gives the music its special appeal.<br /><br /> This year, 2006, marks the re-release of a digitally re-mastered \\"Boston\\" and \\"Don't Look Back\\".  The re-mastering was done by none other than the original genius himself, Tom Scholz and the results are incredible.  There is a warmth to the sound that I've never heard before on either the original vinyl LPs or the CD releases from the 1990s.  Tom has finally brought Brad Delp front and center and one is reminded of just how much of an impact his vocals had on the music.  This is simply the music as Tom intended it to sound all those years ago.  There have been no drastic changes, but the incremental improvements that digital technology can achieve have been combined in a such a way as to render the old releases archaic.  The music has a life that reminds me of the impact it had on me all those years ago, after I'd settled down after my original rejection of the sound and really listened to what was going on.  This re-issue brings the individual instruments to life in a way that I've never heard them before.  One can hear the individual strings of the guitars, including the rhythm guitar, being struck, the cymbals shimmer as I've never heard before, the acoustic introduction to \\"Hitch a Ride\\" is so transparent as to sound unearthly.

0061125237|4.0|C.S. Lewis pioneered a new kind of fantasy when he wrote \\"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe\\" -- the kind where people from our world somehow get swept into another one. It's old stuff now, but Lewis was among the first to attempt such a thing. Because of its originality, and despite some rather hamhanded allegory, it remains a charmingly written, classic story.<br /><br />To avoid the threat of bombings in London, the four Pevensie kids are sent to stay with a wealthy, eccentric professor in the country. But strange things start to happen when Lucy finds a wardrobe during a game of hide-and-seek -- when she climbs in, she finds a snowy woodland and a friendly faun. Her siblings don't believe her... until peevish Edmund also ventures through, and encounters the beautiful but evil White Witch.<br /><br />Soon all four are wandering through the snowy land of Narnia, encountering mythical creatures and talking animals. They also find that the four of them are at the center of a prophecy that will lead to the return of lion-messiah Aslan, and the downfall of the White Witch. But things don't go according to plan when Edmund defects to the Witch's side...<br /><br />How many fantasy stories are written about kids who crawl through a hedge, wander through a door or pick up a magical object, and immediately are swept off into a medieval land? Lots. And they owe a debt of gratitude to C.S. Lewis, theologian, author, and drinking buddy of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" author J.R.R. Tolkien.<br /><br />C.S. Lewis' story is, despite being set during World War II, very 19th-century in tone -- very charming, conversational and full of little details. He populates it with a mishmash of mythic creatures such as dryads, fauns, and talking beavers. The one flaw? Lewis gets quite hamhanded with his Christian allegory, such as Aslan's resurrection. However, he has a very good plot and charming characters to balance it out.<br /><br />Those characters deftly avoid being cutesy, especially by virtue of the malicious Edmund, who slowly has a change of heart after falling in with the evil Witch. He's a much more enjoyable character than his noble brother Peter, just because he's so real. And as a counterbalance, there's Lewis's sweet-natured Lucy -- which was also the name of Lewis' granddaughter.<br /><br />Interesting characters and still-fresh stories give \\"The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" -- which was released awhile back as a movie -- a special ambience. Definitely worth reading.especially by virtue of the malicious Edmund, who slowly has a change of heart after falling in with the evil Witch.

B0000029DD|5.0|This man did indeed die too young, tragically, he drowned in a swimming accident shortly after this album was released.  But, this one work, is so transcendent that it deserves a place in the collection of anyone who truly loves music and understands its ability to move one's soul and emotions beyond the mundane life that one ordinarily lives.  Every song on this album is a true gem which becomes more beautiful with each listening, as one is able to hear it more clearly, applying the jewelers loupe of one's ears to catch each nuance.   <br />  <br />I hardly know where to begin, so I'll start with the song that is my favorite on this album: a song which is rapidly becoming one of my favorites of all the music I've ever listened to - Hallelujah, written by Leonerd Cohen some time ago.  I first heard this tune as part of the soundtrack of The Lord of War  The opening sound one hears is of Jeff sighing deeply before starting to sing with only an unaccompanied acoustic guitar melody that can only be described as haunting in its simplicity.  The first words of the song: <br /> <br />Well, I heard there was a secret chord <br />That David played and it pleased the LORD <br />But, you don't really care for music, do ya? <br /> <br />Well, it goes like this, the fourth, the fifth <br />The minor fall and the major lift <br />The baffled King composing, Hallelujah <br />Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah <br /> <br />The religious references simply drip from this song as the acoustic guitar continues to echo in the background. <br /> From its overtly religious beginning the song moves into the story of a broken relationship with a lover who meant more than anyone in the singer's life.  The heartbreak is so evident that he who can listen to this song without shedding at least a tear or two has no humanity left within him: <br /> <br />Well, baby I've been here before <br />I've seen this room and I've walked this floor <br />Ya know, I used to live alone before I knew ya <br /> <br />And I've seen your flag on the marble arch <br />Our love is not a victory march <br />It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah <br />Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah <br /> <br />Well, there was a time when you let me know <br />What's really going on below <br />But now you never show that do me. Do ya? <br /> <br />But remember when I moved in you <br />And the holy dove was moving, too <br />and every breath we drew was hallelujah <br />Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah <br /> <br />Maybe there's a God above <br />But, all I've ever learned from love <br />was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya <br /> <br />And it's not a cry that you hear at night <br />It's not somebody who's seen the light <br />It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah <br />Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah <br />Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah <br />Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah <br /> <br /> This album is worth the price simply for this one song.  But, the thing is that there are no weak songs on this CD, making it a bargain at any price.  Beyond that, though, this is the type of thoughtful, caring, and insightful music upon which no price can really be placed: it is priceless, timeless.  Jeff Buckley obviously made this album for the sheer love of his art.  The craftsmanship and effort of the making shows through every note and line, every word, and every thought.
B000JLTRIQ|5.0|I think it's a good idea to make a movie about 9/11. There have been movies about historical events before, so why not this one?  <br /> <br />This movie is very moving and it makes you really realize what these people went through. The movie tells the story about a bunch of policemen who went get trapped in rubble and only two survive. It's the true story about John McLoughlin and William Jimeno. The movie views back and forth between the two men trapped and between their families. You really feel for the men and their families as well. It was a really tough time, and you really see that through this movie. Definately watch it!

B00008EYBW|4.0|I loved this movie although I had mixed feelings because the cover looks old.  As usual in Jane Austen's work, each character has so much to offer.  Amanda Root is a great actress and showed the sadness of women of that time when social position was of great importance.  She blossomed in this movie. Ciaran Hinds is great and his anger for being rejected once comes accross.  Just as Pride & Prejudice (both versions- mini-series with Firth and the current one with Keyra Knightley) and Sense and Sensibility, this is a movie to watch many times so you can fully admire it.  Ever time you watch you get more information from the type of writer Jane Austen was.  The availability of subtitles is great for the hearing disabled.
B000003TAR|5.0|This music is from an era where music was changing from one maximum to another.  This is very good to hear at least once.

B000E6UK5K|3.0|This CD is really diffrent from Gilmour's Pink Floyd work. It has a hint of Blues and Jazz mixed with progressive rock. It's very mellow compared to his rock music. If your looking for the old Pink Floyd sound, I don't recommend this CD. It has a good somber mood to it, but it's just not what I had expected. I was expecting a little more of the old sound from David Gilmour.

B000077VPU|4.0|Freddie Mercury's life is honored and celebrated in this amazing concert.  If you're a Queen fan, this DVD should bring a smile to your face, an occasional tear to your eye and joy to your heart.  There are many outstanding performances including Elton John, Slash, David Bowie, Annie Lennox and, most notably, a brilliant performance by George Michael singing Somebody to Love(certainly a surprise to me!).  It was great to hear Roger Taylor and Brian May singing some of Queen's songs (although neither one has a voice as strong as Freddie's).  I strongly recommend this DVD to anyone who is a Queen fan, or a fan of any of the other performers.  OUTSTANDING!
B000H5U832|4.0|my boys LOVE this movie.  they would watch it everyday if we would let them.  my husband and i also enjoyed the movie tremendously.  it is really well done and has enough adult humor to keep us entertained through multiple viewings.  definitely recommend it!
B000GFLAI0|5.0|I remember a time in America when We Shall Overcome and Blowin' in the Wind were national anthems for a civil rights movement that rattled our country to the rafters and unfortunately never actually commenced until that point in time. A young singer songwriter was a focal point of that movement and coincidentally is the same Bob Dylan who gives us Modern Times and systematically beats out on the Billboard Charts all the American Idols and classic rock wannabees and all this at the age of maybe 65. Bob is incredibly transitional- a metamorphosis of a singer songwriter as he exhibited in Nashville Skyline when he suddenly went country and Hurricane when he unexpectedly became urban and street wise and chronicled the events of a Jersey frame of a middleweight contender. When I first became attached to Bob Dylan in maybe'62, a young troubled comedian named Lenny Bruce dominated the pages of an ad hoc paper called the Realist and at the same time appearing at a Times Square dump known as the Dixie Hotel. Lenny was no Seinfield but instead a profane genius. Modern Times to me features some Waylon and Willie in it, some Hank Williams and possibly some Lynyrd Skynyrd influences all combined. The selections that seem to validate my thoughts are Thunder On the Mountain, The Levee's Gonna Break, and Spirit on the Water. It's not that Bob Dylan makes everybody in the music business look bad because of course there is plenty of quality out there. It's kind of like Bob is isolated in his quintessential excellence and nobody but nobody can come close to him poetically or lyrically. In my own frenetic and disjointed youth as a young journalism student at NYU with a raging society and a questioned war effort behind it, I remember Bob tramping around the Village in the early sixties talking Wood Gutherie and with Joan Baez on his arm. Whether it's Hurricane, It's All Over Now Baby Blue, The Master's of War or the prophetic and sadly current Hard Rain's a Gonna Fall, you have to look at Modern Times as another masterpiece and reflective of Bob Dylan's insurmountable cachet.

0307263118|5.0|'The Sea' is the first of Banville's works that I've read. So exquisite it was, I can't wait to savor his other masterpieces.  <br /> <br />This book requires a meditative walk of remembrance alongside its narrator, Max Morden as he ponders his losses, his identity, his youth and senescence. His wife, Anna, has died so he cantankerously rejects his daughter's solicitude and retreats to a coastal village of his childhood summers. Suspended in this bereft state, his mind is a pendulum swinging between the recent and the past, yearning for reconnection and reconciliation. He contemplates his relationship with Anna and the Graces from his youth, seeking solace by piecing his memories.   <br /> <br />Banville's writing resonates with sheer imagery- vivid, eloquent and mesmerizing. The pace may be pedantic to some but the linguistic artistry makes the journey so worthwhile. Walk through this one unhurriedly - don't leave it behind.
0143037757|5.0|Tony Judt's book is a tour de force, an all around sociological, economic, political and military history of an epoch which changed the world. His grasp of the total picture and the importance of single events is amazing and tells us what impacts history. its a must for anyone who wants to understand the history and politics these last sixty years. its also a great read, i purchased it to wander through sections, but ended up reading it cover to cover.

B000HEVALC|5.0|I have the LP of \\"Million Dollar Quartet\\" as well, so you can say I am a fan.  This CD is longer, and in a better order, and in parts clearer, so for fans is well worth adding. The only place I know to hear Elvis, Jerry Lee, and Carl Perkins together not sure you can hear Johnny Cash and with Sam Phillips gone we cannot ask. Buy it.
B000AM4PBS|4.0|The DVD's are terrific as expected. I had never watched Friends in its primetime so I love having the entire set to watch in order from start to finish! The box is nice but NOT super good quality.  It seams like heavy duty black cardboard, which came with a few scratches on it already. The plastic cover seems like it would be easy to break. If you're careful in its handling you should be ok, but I wouldnt pay extra for the box.
0151001634|5.0|This book inspired some excellent movies and I can see why.
B00005U8EM|5.0|I haven't laughed so hard in a very long time.  What a terrific concept!  In the end, the weatherman found out what we all need to learn - that human beings are important, that we need to put ourselves out in meeting the needs of others.  It is in reaching out to others that we find \\"what goes around, comes around\\"...it will come back to your own door.  Told in a very funny way, it is a delightful story.
B000ESSTL0|5.0|As i aware that this remastered version is great for 5.1 surround sound system and i do agree that it is completely new exprerience to listen to. I've tried to listen to these 5.1 mix by headphone and i would recommend to any other headphone listeners that you will find the new exprerience too. I choose 'PL II music'mode from my home theater from the dvd disc with DTS 5.1 then i was blown away from all new exprerience ! especially from this 'Vilator'. I've tried 'SOFAD' too and it's good but not great as 'Violator' then i will buy some more like 'the masses' and 'Some great..' soon. <br /> <br />
B000683VI4|5.0|This is a wonderful love story of the old fashioned kind. This kind of \\"Love\\" we could only wish to experience once in our lifetime. I could watch this over and over. Don't forget your Kleenex you might need it.

B000HCO83Q|3.0|They warn us about sequels, but still we buy them. This X-Men was not nearly as good as its predecessors in terms of plot, construction, and flow.  I felt embarrassed for the actors -- most of whom are excellent -- to be participants in such a very poor film.  Oh well, at least they presumably got paid well for their time and trouble.  Save your money, just buy the first two films on DVD.
078322740X|5.0|Great film. Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn and Dana Delany are fantastic in this enjoyable, fun moview.  Both Steve and Goldie are hard for any others to match. They easily switch from comedians to serious.  A film you'll enjoy watching repeatedly.

B000HCO83G|4.0|X-men is, in my opinion, the best Marvel franchise out there. This movie also, is the best out of the three. I was dissapointed that this DVD wasn't released in the way of the other two because i was expecting a grand DVD. I'm sure sometime this year there'll be another DVD released, but I'm not going to go and spend another $20 - $30 on the same movie for extra special features which should've been released the first time. I gotta say this DVD isn't the worst especially for the lucky ones who got 22 Deleted scenes (me). This is a great movie and a good DVD it's worth a watch.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|Shipping was fast The CD is good. I did buy \\"new\\" and maybe it was, however it was a promotional copy that was my only concern. But it plays great and I have no complaints.
B000H7JD4A|5.0|Since I have been out of the Iron Maiden loop for some time(last one I picked was 'No Prayer For The Dying' when it was released) I didn't know if it was worth my time and money. But after hearing of the title some months before it was released I started to get interested. Though 'A Matter Of Life And Death' is far from their masterpiece it is quite excellent from a group of fellas that have been creating music for a long time. The feel of the album is slower, mature and certainly has a great idea behind.  <br />Many epics on board this time and most keep my interest. The things that stand out to me are Bruce's vocals which at first sounded a bit thin and weak. But after listening to such classics as 'Powerslave','Somewhere In Time' and 'Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son' his vocals haven't changed much. He still performs really well considering some others who have been singing longer and shorter than him who don't hold a candle to him. The next being Nicko's drum work which is the best I have ever heard from him. He brings in some new ideas and it really shows. With three guitars you would think of the sound as muddled but it is far from it. Very clean sound from Murray, Smith and Gers. Then ofcourse from the mastermind that makes it happen, Mr.Steve Harris who truly is the main force behind Maiden. He shines but does take a seat in the back letting the other guys get their piece of the pie.  <br />The highlights for me would be the unbelievable sounding 'Brighter Than a Thousand Suns'......WOW. 'Pilgrim' which has a great feel to. And 'For the Greater Good of God' which is the center piece of the album......great stuff. That's not say there aren't mediocre tracks like the Dickinson penned song 'Out of the Shadows' which is probably the weakest number on the album. And the first single released, the boring sounding 'Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg' which isn't a bad song but doesn't hold my interest to well.  <br />All in all this is a great release and worth owning and ofcourse if you can get your hands on this limited edition it is even better with a 30 minute dvd featuring behind the scenes of the making of 'A Matter Of Life And Death'......lots of funny and interesting stuff.  <br />Eddie is alive and very doing well!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br />
0743298020|5.0|This book is destine to be known as a great literary piece.  It contains the right amount of mystery and it is always fun to read books where the main character loves books as much as I do.

B000HT386M|1.0|I adore Adam Sandler; in fact, other than \\"Going Overboard,\\" I have LOVED every one of his works! One would not be remiss to say that Adam Sandler can \\"make sunshine on a cloudy day.\\" I have used his works in my own classes to illustrate that comedies ARE valuable to society. Likewise, I am a huge Christopher Walken fan . . . let's face it, much like butter, the man makes everything better!!    With this in mind, I have no choice but to declare this film an absolute train wreck.  Unlike other reviewers, I believe the Adam Sandler DOES have the range for this genre (family-comedy) . . . but the writing for Click just did not permit him to showcase his considerable talents. As you have already read, this film is a bad cliché from beginning to end. Moreover, the \\"running-gag\\" with his dog and the plushie-duck was not as much offensive as it was tedious (and, admittedly, not family appropriate).    Its portrayal of stay-at-home mothers was shockingly stereotypical (greedy for love and attention) . . . but its heavy-handed portrayal of working-fathers was even more startling (greedy for money and advancement). Moreover, not only was I left unmoved by this film, I was actually repulsed. I think only a simple-minded viewer would find anything of value in this waste of celluloid.     If you are an Adam Sandler fan (like me), there is no stopping you from watching this film . . . but you should Netflix it before buying it.
B00005AR3G|5.0|The first time I saw this movie I was skeptical. A college student, watching a -recent- Disney animated feature?  My expectations were minimal.  I laughed all the way through and immediately went out and bought this for my collection.<br /><br />I watched this movie last night and was reminded again why I love this flick so much.  It's nothing like any other animated Disney feature out there.  Mature, and snide humor, endearing characters, and fantastic animation make this stand out as the best.  Characters like Yzma and Kronk produce laughs all throughout the movie, and some of the characters seem reminiscent of other Disney films (Squirrel from sleeping beauty, etc.)<br /><br />This is definitely not geared toward small children but is highly recommended for anyone with a snarky sense of humor, or who likes off-the-wall animation.<br /><br />**EDIT**<br />This movie is more appropriate for people who are old enough to understand sarcastic and cynical humor.  That's not to say there aren't silly scenes or moments in the film that a younger child might not enjoy, but the majority of jokes will most likely be lost upon someone under the age of eight.<br /><br />An example of this kind of humor when The Emperor (David Spade) is critiquing all of his potential new wives early on in the film.  He makes commentary on each, including \\"Let me guess, you have a greaaat personality.\\"  How a small child would find this entertaining is hard to fathom.  Again, I would put the level of humor on par with that of SHREK, although with considerably less sexual innuendo.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|WOW.  This collection of songs are amazing and the way that Sarah performs them are of course even more gratifing.  It's a nice, mellow, yet powerful Christmas c.d.(what else would you expect from Sarah?) and I would recommend it to anyone!
B000AAF1U4|4.0|This movie is so cool and funny!!! I love Emperor Kuzco and how Kuzco cares abouut himself. It was funny. This movie showed how Kuzco learned how to step outside his own world and get along with other people around him, not being selfish. It's filled with many special features too!
B000HD1AEA|5.0|Sarah is one of my all time favorites.  We already had the first Mirrorball c.d. and were skeptial about buying this one.  She had some additional songs on this version and honestly it's been a great addition to our collection!

I tried to read two other patterns book prior to this one. However, I never finished them. I even had to take a DP class at my university; it was required for the CS program there. I still didn't fully understood DP after the semester. With this HF book, I'd say that I now understand DP and OO concepts. <br />
B000JJS8TM|2.0|I beg to differ.  This is a rip-off.  The CD remixes may be masterful, but one has the sense that a bright 14 year old with Garageband could do something much like this.  Most annoying is the DVD.  Expecting old footage, or even something from Cirque du Soleil--after all, the liner notes tell you that that's the premise for this thing?  Guess again.  There's a single image  that remains onscreen for the duration of album, an image that stays before you as you presumably wallow around on your floor marveling at the Surround-sounded remix. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll kiss twenty bucks good-bye.
0618680004|3.0|Before considering Professor Dawkins's bestseller, a mention must be made of the over 300 reviews here posted as well as the assorted blogs, debates, and article the book has provoked.  Reading through these, whether pro or con, one can not help but notice a clear and unnerving trend, not unlike one sees in reviews regarding works on the Middle East conflict; those who agree with his thesis from the outset almost always offer resounding and unadulterated praise without considering even the possibility of flaws in his methodology or logic.  Of course, at the same time, those who hold his position as heresy rarely respond in any logical method to his position and rarely even seem willing to acknowledge the professor's obvious strength's as a writer.  Such failure of reasoning on both sides points to a disheartening decline in the state of the western intellectual tradition that should give every person pause.  As a great fan of Professor Dawkins's previous work, \\"The Selfish Gene,\\" a book that provided me with considerable food for thought several years back and profoundly altered my thinking, I looked forward with some excitement to \\"The God Delusion.\\"  Reading the new book on recognizes quickly that this is in fact one book, with three goals.  Professor Dawkins imagines these goals as not only compatible, but structural to the argument he seeks to build.  As for me I am less certain.  The first part restates much of what might be found in \\"The Selfish Gene,\\" albeit more briefly and with some editions based on more recent scholarship.  There is no need to review the whole of thesis, his obvious purpose will suffice; defending Darwinian evolution from the current relentless and often absurd assault it now suffers at the hands of certain individuals who prefer to shout at the storm rather than consider an umbrella.  Now \\"The Selfish Gene,\\" was nothing short of brilliant, and Dawkins here again demonstrates much of what makes him a gifted writer of science, explaining the strengths of Darwin's theory, and devastating many of the positions of those who argue against it.  Other works of course cover this same ground, but there can be no doubt Dawkins here shines.  Of course, these points are not the goal of Dawkins's work, but only the foundation of a broader argument.  From there he moves into an evolutionary thesis for the origin of belief and religion.  Here he remains on firm ground, though many may find it disquieting, even as he moves to the next logical position that evolution and the cosmos requires no deity to explain itself.  And it is from there that the Professor moves onto shakier ground as he seeks not to simply discount the evidence often cited for a supreme being, but rather argue against the possibility of its existence.  Of course, the logical difficulty of proving an absolute negative - for example, \\"there are no blue dogs,\\" are legion -- yet this of course does not deter the professor who approaches the subject with a zealot's fervor.  Yet, many of the arguments here stand as both pugnacious and flawed, moreover revealing that while well versed in science, professor Dawkins might consider a few classes in philosophy, not to mention religion so that he might recognize that the Anglicanism in which he was raised is not the totality of all Christianity and, moreover, Christianity is by no means the totality of religion.  One might take his arguments one at a time, but I will focus on one, it having received great attention.  Dawkins posits \\"A designer God cannot be used to explain organized complexity because any God capable of designing anything would have to be complex enough to demand the same kind of explanation in his own right.\\"  Of course this ignores the prevalent notion of both the Jewish and Islamic tradition that God exists both inside and outside his creation, and thus cannot be fully known.  Moreover, he likely would not like this argument applied to cosmology; the fact that it grows increasingly complex as our understanding grows does not make the next more complex factor less likely, but merely outside of our current grasp.  The effort to understand this with probability as a method of rendering a supreme being unlikely comes across as self serving and holding to a standard the professor would surely not wish to apply to science.  Yet it is in the final piece of his work that Professor Dawkins becomes the most vitriolic and, in fact, a bit sophomoric as he attacks religion by pointing to all the evil in history rendered in its name.  The effort appears like the work of a rather polemic inclined undergrad, especially as the Professor fails to consider the good brought by religion, nor seriously consider the degree to which concepts arising from religion have influenced or even founded much of the secular humanist philosophy he holds so dear.  Moreover, Professor Dawkins shows no taste for considering the considerable evil done in the name of atheism.  Regarding these, however, he has no stomach for discussion, writing curtly \\"\\"We are not in the business of counting evils heads, compiling two rival roll calls of iniquity.\\"  Yet that is exactly what he does when it comes to those of faith, ignoring the torture and murder of many, often due to their particular commitment to religion done in the name of \\"reason\\" by Lenin, Stalin, Mao, and their ilk.  Instead, Dawkins contrasts theoretical atheist utopia with the religions practical and often horrific evils.  Sadly, such an effort generates much heat and little light.  Had he been willing to engage the more interesting and complex issue, he might well have concluded that humanity is capable of much horror and violence, for many motivations.  But then, such a conclusion would hardly serve his narrow polemic goals.  Nothing in the world should be held as not subject to reason.  Unfortunately, Professor Dawkins could well have used more of it in engaging in his efforts.  While one can certainly render cogent arguments for atheism, indeed many have, the effort here seems more designed to score easy points by burning straw men at the stake.  No doubt, this review will receive votes for and many more against, not based on its reasoning, but simply based on people's particular faith on which side of these issues the reside.  But then again, most seem inclined to simply march along side their ideological kin, rather than engage in serious consideration of such weighty matters.
B000002H97|5.0|I don't know what happened to me because normally I sit at home with a glass of Cab and just chill out to vintage Joni Mitchell or some of the anti-war anthems by Joan Baez and just call it a night.

I will be giving this to all my knitting club friends, for sure!

0393327655|4.0|Some issues (dangers of extremism and fundamentalism especially) are treated thoughtfully, thoroughly and largely objectively, and the book is well worth reading - a real breath of fresh air in a world where criticism of religion is not tolerated, but as he continues on about the dangers of religionism, Harris merely replaces the three major world religions with \\"religion\\" (under a pseudonym) of his own liking, despite his avowed atheism.  Overall, I loved the first two thirds or so, despite his numerous misunderstandings (of mysticism and rationalism, for example) and consider it a \\"must read\\", but was disappointed the last third of the book.
B000HCO83Q|3.0|I gave it 3 stars because while the action I felt was superior to the first 2 the movie was just too short for the amount of characters they had to work with.  Some characters were just completely underused like Angel, rogue.  I felt even Dark Phoenix was underused here.  I would have preferred more exploration into the 2 personalities.   <br /> <br />But, like I said the movie just wasnt long enough to get into more character stuff.  Even an added 30-40 minutes would have helped so much if they had used that time to flesh out the characters and storyline.  But, If you enjoyed 1 & 2 I would think you would enjoy this one as well it was worth it to buy for me.

B000005JA8|5.0|I just introduced myself to the Captain by buying this album and Spotlightkid/clear spot. I must say this is now one of my favorite albums of all time! This is probably the craziest album you'll ever hear but thats a good thing. Why? because it never gets old theres enough zany personality and dynamics to fill 10 cds. Every time I notice something new! A pure original! Captain Beefheart was to rock what Arnold Shoenburgh was to \\"classical\\" music or what Ornette Coleman was to Jazz. Now one of things that might make this cd confusing at 1st is there are some very serious tracks and some very humurous/tounge in cheek tracks all in the same place. But either way madness is the name of the game. All the songs belong together its just that sometimes Beefheart is observing the madness in the world (\\"Dachau Blues\\") and sometimes hes acting it out (\\"Old Fart at Play\\").  Some tracks fall between these 2 extremes (\\"Hobo Chang Ba\\") In all cases its very cathartic for me so I love it!
0393327655|4.0|I was born in 1946. I was raised by my grandmother until I was 19. As a boy, I was indoctrinated by my grandmother, who was what we now call a Born Again Christian. She taught me to be afraid of nearly everything. She convinced me that there was a heaven, a hell, a God who watched my every move and that the Bible was the Word of God.<br /><br />By the time I was a teenager, I began to doubt nearly all of this. But for decades, I tried to live up to the Christian ideal, belonging to the Methodist Church and the Mormon Church and visiting Catholic, Pentecostal, Baptist and even Jehovah's Witnesses churches and a Jewish synagogue. No church seemed to understand me and what I believed deep in my heart until my wife and I found the Unitarian Universalist church. Finally, we felt at home.<br /><br />It's not often that I see my strain of rational freethinking articulated in a book, but `'The End of Faith'' lucidly warns of the peril and ludicrousness of organized religion so courageously that I felt comforted as I read it, justified in my beliefs, or rather, lack of them. It was almost as if Sam Harris had been poking around in my brain.<br /><br />Sam Harris presents major religious systems like Judaism, Christianity and Islam as forms of publicly endorsed madness, their essential doctrine and rites ridiculous, antiquated and, significant in terms of humanity's long-term continued existence, equally incompatible. A doctoral candidate in neuroscience at the University of California, Harris writes what many of us believe, but few are willing to articulate in present-day America: `'We have names for people who have many beliefs for which there is no rational justification,\\" Harris writes. \\"When their beliefs are extremely common, we call them `religious'; otherwise, they are likely to be called `mad,' `psychotic' or `delusional.' `'<br /><br />To mention one example: `'Jesus Christ--who, as it turns out, was born of a virgin, cheated death and rose bodily into the heavens--can now be eaten in the form of a cracker. A few Latin words spoken over your favorite Burgundy, and you can drink his blood as well. Is there any doubt that a lone subscriber to these beliefs would be considered mad?'' The menace of religious conviction, he continues, `'is that it allows otherwise normal human beings to reap the fruits of madness and consider them holy.''<br /><br />The terrorists who flew jet planes into the World Trade Center believed in the religiousness of their cause. The Christians who are prepared to risk nuclear war in the Middle East for the sake of accelerating the \\"rapture\\" (the second coming of Christ) believe in the holiness of their cause. In Harris's view, such fundamentalists are taking their religion too seriously, depending, blindly, on the holy texts on which their devotion is built, all of which - it should be noted - are bizarre anthologies of bloodshed and retribution, celestial decrees that infidels must die.<br /><br />Without religion, my wife and I are free to concentrate on the only life we are ever going to have. We're free to exult in the remarkable good fortune that we enjoy through having been being born. We are thankful that we have a life, and have forsaken our vain and presumptuous desire for a second one. The world would be a better place if we all had this positive attitude to life. It would also be a better place if morality was all about doing good to others and refraining from hurting them, rather than religion's morbid obsession with private sin and the evils of sexual enjoyment.<br /><br />`'The End of Faith'' is far from faultless.

B00065GX64|4.0|This was basically a superior movie, still daring in its subject matter and approach going on 70 years later. There are parts in the middle that are just a bit too wordy, however. Sorry, I wasn't looking for a car chase, but I do feel there's a bit of drag about 2/3 of the way through. The movie as a whole more than makes up for it. Was that the worst I could say? Definitely deserves its place in the noir pantheon.
0393327655|5.0|This is an excellent book which documents, in a very scholarly manner, why it makes no sense to have faith in God or to practice a religion based upon ancient books and scriptures.  It documents the very barbaric teachings that proliferate in both the christian Bible as well as the Koran.  It documents the barbaric and religiously based practices of both christians ( from the Inquisition forward) and the muslims (continuing into the present time), and it explains how these practices continuously threaten the well being and now the existance of civilization.  The book contrasts the tremendous evolution in thought that has occurred in biology, physiology, medicine, astronomy, and other sciences to the nearly non-existant evolution of thought that has occurred in religious beliefs and practices. <br /> <br />If, for many years, your gut has told you that religiosity makes no sense, this book will provide you with a well structured argument to support your feelings.  On the otherhand, if you are one of the faithful, this book may scare you.  I would suggest that you read it anyway.  The book acknowledges that there are many good things that come from religion and it explains that in todays world, there are other ways and methods that can be used to derive those same wonderful benefits.

B000BNNLN4|2.0|There are not many books that I read that I find boring, but unfortunately this was one of them.  I was especially dissapointed after all the glowing reviews saying how funny this book was supposed to be. I found it very repetitive and dull. I also agree with other reviewers who wonder what the whole side-story about the tractor book was for. Those readings from the father's history book were especially boring.  It also took me more than a week to finally finish this since I just couldn't get into it. It was just silly episodes about the eccentric father and greedy, but supposedly, stunningly-beautiful Valentina over and over.  The author tried to delve a little into the history of why the sister was the way she was and about the horrors of war but then left us with no clear ideas about what she thought about these topics. We also never quite know whether Valentina is a good or bad person. Luckily I didn't pay much for this because I bought it second-hand from Ebay.  I wish I'd gotton it out of the library instead. Not worth the time it takes to read since there are much better books out there.  I learned nothing from this book and can't even say I entertained by it either.
0060776757|5.0|This is a great book  for a loyal fan of U2.The book is a hard cover with good quality. The book  is huge  itself and  has lots  of info about band members and  nice pictures also , alot in color also.You cant beat this  price, the best around i think .Its close up and personal about each band member. So if you love to read and Love U2 as much as i do buy the Book!

B000J10EQU|5.0|I was caught in traffic, Tokyo traffic, trying to make it to the theater to catch the show.  In Japan, theater seats are assigned when you buy the tickets, no open seating here...  So I pre-ordered, prepaid for the seats to be sure I got the ones I like...  top row, just off center.  I was out shopping with the family all morning and we should have had more than enough time to make the show and even get something fromt he snackbar before it started...  BUT, Tokyo traffic is like Seattle rain...  you know it will always be there, but it get crazy bad at the drop of a hat, anytime for no special reason at all... <br /> <br />I got to the show 20 minutes late, Clark had just showed up back at the Daily Planet and Superman had not yet reappeared to the world...  \\"Wow, I didn't miss much, I guess,\\" so I thought...  but as the show went on, I found a few things I didn't quite understand...background issues, etc... <br /> <br />I finaly realized that I had missed more than I thought... <br /> <br />I had no choice, I had to buy the DVD to be able to see what I missed. (My wife wouldn't let me see it again at the theater or I would have...) <br /> <br />I was not disappointed, The DVD is good, and its special features were well worth it.  It is a show I will watch over and over... <br /> <br />The guy they got for Superman/Clark Kent, did a wonderful job and in fact is the most convincing I have seen...  Not about he's a great Superman...just that seeing him as Clark and seeing him as Superman, it is easier to believe people wouldn't get it... <br /> <br />Also, at times, his Clark voice sounds so much like the Clark I grew up with, Christopher Reeves...  I think he would have approved...  But what do I know ;-)
B000004CYT|5.0|This album is a reissue of the recording done in the eighties and, I believe, is still among the best interpretations of Beethoven's symphonies. The performance is amzingly crisp and clear. You will not regret if you buy this set.
B000FGGE5Y|4.0|Many shows; i.e. Blade, etc. have suggested that Vipirism is a disease.  \\"Ripply's Believe it or Not\\" mentions a verified human \\"vampire\\" who drank the blood of young girls believing it would keep her young (yes it was a woman). <br /> <br />This show is a \\"not so distant\\" future, set in Shanghai China (excuse my poor spelling if its wrong).  A long existant disease was intentially mutated and the results were NOT what they hoped for. <br /> <br />Highly contageous, the disease spread quickly and people became phobic about any germs.  They became a version of Nazi Germany with \\"sick\\" people being the enemy, especially those with this new \\"Vampirical\\" virus. <br /> <br />The special effects were and are intended to be, at times, nothing more than a \\"see what cool things we can do now\\" show, but at times they seriously enhance the Fantasy SciFi effect of the show. <br /> <br />Overall worth the price of the show, but don't expect a deep story line, these types of shows are for the show not the tell.  You have to use your imagination to believe this world could exist.  I believe that IF they choose to make another, and I honestly hope they do, they will flesh out some of the relationships and personalities they started in this one.  They DID leave it in perfect position for a good sequal.

B000E1ZBGS|4.0|This is a very good  movie.  The acting is wonderful, the story is engrossing.  And, of course, it has a happy ending.  The movie strays from Jane Austin's book in that the Elizabeth of the movie seems to be the one who is both proud and prejudice and Mr. Darcy is simply misunderstood.  In the book, Mr. Darcy has a significant pride issue and is not completely undeserving of Elizabeth's disdain.  If you are not very familiar with the book or if you can set foundational differences aside, the movie is very nicely done and enjoyable indeed.

This well illustrated book by Boynton does a good job of calming him down in the short 10 pages.  The easy to follow \\"story\\" and effective rhymes help calm him before he drops off to slumberland.
B0001GF2DS|5.0|This is an amazing DVD set of one of the alltime great films of the 20th century. The feature film has been beautifully remastered. The bonus disc is worth the price alone with tons of behind the scenes stories and insights. It also includes some cool mini-posters of the original theater posters. The only minus (and it is a very small minus) is the box itself, not well thought out. Buy this set!
0399226907|4.0|Well illustrated as usual for a Carle book, but the picture of the butterfly at the end still has me confused.  It seems like the wings are upside down.....
B000FIMG68|5.0|Buying the DVD box set is much better than waiting for one episode a week, and then having to put up with ad breaks. Lost 2 is awesome and watching the eps one after the other provides a better bearing on how things develop. Can't wait for 3 - although I'll have to wait for it to finish its TV season (and make sure I don't see previews) before buying the new set. Lost 1 & 2 are highly recommended purchases ... although if it came down to a choice I'd definitely buy the entire West Wing 1-7 series first because Jed Bartlet just rocks hard dude.
B000F8O35U|5.0|I'm glad that I purchased this video for my grand daughters, they love it! It's pretty and delightful, they say. It keeps them amazed as it's filled with great colors and beauty. The music keeps them singing along with the movie. Recommend it for all who have little girls to enjoy each others company.  The smiles on their faces are everlasting!!!
B0007Z4S4C|5.0|This is a cd that I listen to over and over, especially in my truck.  I played it for my boss and he immediately went out and bought it!
B000FFJYCU|5.0|The best film about motorcar racing -specifically Formula One- directed by John Frankenheimer in the 1966 season, is a collection item and has been beautifully produced in a two-disc special edition DVD, with the actual film and a lot more about the making and racing reviews. Starts with the Grand-Prix of Monaco and ends at Monza, including actual scenes during the particular races, plus the ones needed for the filming with excellent overlap. Indispensable for motorcar racing fans.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I first heard of the Firefly series from the movie Serenity. After seeing the movie I really wanted to see the series. I was not disappointed. In fact, the series got my wife hooked into being a Firefly fan. You just wouldn't expect the way the writers worked quick-witted humor into a sci-fi action film as they have done. If there is another movie or a return of the series, I'll be there. Great collection to have in my DVD set. I highly recommend this set above all others.
055380457X|4.0|This is not the kind of book which will describe how their technology works in detail. Anyone who expects to read about it on the book, certainly will be disappointed, although a brief explanation is given. This is good material for those to are willing to understand what was the idea behind Google, their founders background and how the company came to be what it is these days.<br /><br />It is interesting to see how a simple concept became one of the most admired Internet companies ever. Google, in the very beginning, was not intended to be a money maker, but just an engine which intended to help people find what they were looking for over the Internet. The book approaches the coming of corporate interest, the placement of the Google Ad-Sense concept (ads which are paid by click and not by print) and the other products that came later.<br /><br />In brief: this is a biography which is directed to people who admire the search engine they often use and want to know more about its story.
B000G73UEU|5.0|I am a fan of Leonard Cohen and I thoroughly enjoyed \\"I'm Your Man\\".  It was great.
B00005JPDY|5.0|The Good Shepherd is full of twists and mystery and tension that will keep you on the edge of your seat the entire movie.  Matt Damon plays a CIA counter intelligence agent who gets roped into service the first time while still a student at Yale, being forced to choose between a professor and his country in the 1930's during the Nazi buildup, before war actually started.  He becomes more and more involved in the secret Skull and Bones Society at Yale, and gets recruited for more intelligence work during the war.  He goes, largely because he sees an escape from a personal life that isn't going the way he'd like.<br /><br />He returns six years later, having made a successful name for himself as silent, icy, and incredibly loyal.  But his career success comes at the expense of his family and personal relationships.  In the end he has to make a gut-wrenching choice, and figure out a way to protect everyone he loves.<br /><br />The movie can be hard to follow, mostly because it jumps around in time quite a bit.  The movie opens with the Bay of Pigs debacle, and then goes back to show events leading up to that event and beyond,  with everyone trying to figure out who the mole was.<br /><br />It does a good job of exploring all of the family dynamics, without losing any of the intensity and mystery.  The acting was superb.  The characters could seem just one-dimensional, but I think that's because you have to be that way when you're a CIA spy.<br /><br />It's a day later and this movie is still sticking with me, so it's a success in my book.

B000HCO83G|4.0|Great Movie - I have seen the other 2 Xmen movies but I know that this xmen movie is the best of the bunch.  Must see for fans of xmen and other comic book heroes.  Cant wait to see more, hopefully there will be more.

B0007OASII|5.0|Kamelot represents alot of power metal bands that I have yet to tap into.<br /><br />I believe that this album has a lot to offer. reading other reviews, I was shocked to see that Shagrath of Dimmu Borgir offered his vocals on the first track. Shagrath is a very versatile singer, but that's getting off the subject. if you are a fan of Rhapsody Of Fire, Iced Earth, Hammerfall, Stratovarius, and other power metal bands, this album is for you.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|The funniest movie of the year!  I still laugh everytime I watch it!  The 4 alternate endings are a great inclusion, a must buy!
0307346609|4.0|I found this book to be very entertaining.  I am a long time fan of Zombie movies and a voracious reader, but rarely have I ever read a zombie book.  This one was a delightful exception.  The story was a real page turner.  It went into areas that were both familar and new and explored into scenes that have only been hinted at in anything I have previously known.  The chapter that described a zombie horde attacking a U.S. Military position was astounding...overwhelming. <br /> <br />The book provides independant chapters as highlights of all the different phases of the zombie war from the start of the breakout to the final aftermath.  Every chapter has it's own unique perspective and appeal.  For anyone whoever loved Romero's Dead series or any of it's various clones, this is a great read.  I recommend it highly.
B000BW7QWW|1.0|Serenity is one of the worst films I've seen in a while. My libertarian friend from MLP, J.L., raved about it, but to me it's total crap. The most boring story ever, I totally tuned it out about 20 minutes into the film. The aesthetic and artistic value is just about nil. It seems like a pulp action movie suited to country hicks in the schticks, or mentally-challenged farm hands. I can understand liking it if you're high on a few beers or a joint and you would find almost anything entertaining, but really, being fully sober I couldn't find anything to like about this. Even the story is somewhat muddled, something about a female action hero who is always ready to bang some heads together to save the day. I mean, please, there are better action movies! How about \\"Starship Troopers\\", for instance? This is 3rd rate sci-fi. I've had very bad luck with all the movies my libertarian friends have recommended to me. Movies like \\"Fight Club\\", and this. Total losers. Well, I've concluded that if you want to understand the truth about politics, listen to a libertarian; if you want guidance about elite movies or any other High Art, it's better to seek advice from \\"the establishment\\".
0895260131|5.0|Robert Spencer has put his finger on the pulse of failure. The United States alone can do very little to change that part of Islam based on the hate and conquest of other ideologies. It will take the world waking up from passive political correctness to defeat once again this swarm of fanatics and those who support them actively or silently. CNN and Fox have recently aired similar material which only lends additional validity to Mr. Spencers research. This is a MUST READ.
0618680004|5.0|Everyone on Earth should read 'The God Delusion'. <br />Non-religious people should read it because it offers concepts related to the flaws of religion, many of which you probably wouldn't even be aware of before reading this book. It will open your eyes further to many interesting things, such as bizarre human psychology/behaviour and the appreciation of a Godless world, aided through the mind of Dawkins. <br />Religious people should look past their defences and read it as well, with an open mind. For if they were really honest to themselves about the pursuit of a justified faith and God, they will get a perspective well worth taking into account. It breaks down many of the arguments for a God on a level most of us have not seen before, going through individual points well orginised and efficiently, leaving you wandering how the human race has been this gulliable for so long.  <br />There is an air of aggressivness to this book, which unfortunately religious people will put up a wall against, but this should not go against the work of Dawkins, for on such a subject as religion, one has to fight fire with fire. <br />I admire the courage of Dawkins in writing this book, on such a sensitive subject and hope he can continue enlightening the masses with his facinating points of view. <br />Read it, you'll see why it's a best-seller.
B00004RFFS|5.0|How can you go wrong watching a movie with Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise and Antonio Banderas?  The story is riveting and the acting is intense.
0618680004|5.0|Dawkins' God Delusion    \\"The God Delusion\\" by Richard Dawkins is a good read, worth the price, but its title is misleading. Dawkins' address is less about god and more about debunking the theism of the Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. His stated purpose is to convert his readership from such religions to atheism. As such, the book is Dawkins' latest salvo in his war against devout Western fundamentalism. By my reading, his arguments have merit and entertainment value and I expect many if not most readers will judge similarly. But I wonder if he's focusing on yesterday's battles to the detriment of more fundamental concerns.    Joseph Campbell, mythologist, has observed that humankind's god-belief is pervasive and the source of all religions. To deny its existence is to over-intellectualize the mysteries of existence. Each religion puts a face and symbology on the god-belief appropriate to its time, place and worldview, e.g. Zeus and his thunderbolts. When these elements change, a new face and symbology are required but the god-belief endures. Dawkins focuses on ancient faces and symbologies even as many in the modern world, including many of the devout, are searching for new faces and symbologies. Dawkins would maintain that such searchers have become atheistic, e.g. see his deism. [He is technically correct for deism but not strictly correct (for any religion) since all gods are potentially personal gods.] Others might suspect that those same searchers see themselves as evolving religiously. Dawkins ignores this possibility and appears to have limited awareness of the god-belief and its source, \\"The onus is not on me to answer.\\" (See middle pg. 270 to section end.) Perhaps with enough consciousness raising he could, to the profit of us all, redirect his iconoclastic energies and lead us to where the god-belief will take us next. Not likely, since shouldering this task might mean acknowledging the sense of the divine underlying much of what he calls atheism. Moreover, he would risk becoming a theologian, or worse a religious prophet, with his possible conversion from atheism to an evolved religion. Is Dawkins as the next Paul even imaginable?
B000J3EEBY|4.0|This CD is in a new style. It takes some time to get used to. The songs are not the usual Celtic ones. These are songs from around the world that are sung to be only somewhat Celtic in nature. If you are expecting the usual CD, this is not the one for you. If you are more adventurous, then I'd say give it a try. The music is well done but just different.
B000IOM0YM|5.0|Ah, the glory days. Before the disco pap of \\"I Was Made For Lovin You,\\" the kiddie fans, and the lackluster solo LPs.  This DVD truely captures \\"the greatest band in the land\\" back when they could powerhouse rock, and unlike many other releases put out over the years, this footage actually captures whole sets in their entirety with few exceptions...Even if you are only casual Kiss fan, you MUST get this collection! It includes rare raw live footage from 74,75,76, and 77, promo clips, and even a bonus disc from Madison Square Garden.  Sure, there are a few blips (mainly in the \\"Winterland\\" show) due to the archival footage of the master tapes, but overall this is a fantastic treat for anyone familiar with their first three LPs and missing the fabulous stage show that set them apart from their boring contemporaries.  I saw them live--this is almost as fun as being at the show!  It's amazing just how much energy Paul exuded, and it's still great fun watching the comic book antics of Gene, which are unintentionally funny while also grotesque (Also included in this set is rare footage of Gene's hair catching on fire at the Cobo Hall).  Best of all, this classic footage finally puts to rest the ongoing sour grapes of those critics who asserted Ace couldn't play--Not only can he play a hell of a riff, but when you consider how high he must've been when this stuff was filmed, you'll agree his mastery of the instrument is what set the standard for later imitators...who else is gonna give ya this much bang for your buck!  Have fun, it won't dissappoint!
0790729350|5.0|I purchased this DVD at my husband's request.  He had viewed it has a young man, and wanted to revisit it after 30+ years.  I had never previously seen the film.  We were both impressed by the film quality and also had a \\"groovy\\" time reaching back through the years to the time of our youth.  This film is excellent quality and a great historical record, worth the viewing for all.  Far out!!
0307263118|5.0|This book is filled with beautiful use of language and texture.  The landscape and feel of this book are just right to convey the mood of this character.  Max Morden has just lost his wife and has now returned to the Irish seaside town where he spent his childhood.  Banville's writing reminds me a little of Updike in his capturing this aging man's look back upon the events and relationships of his past.  The story unfolds slowly and without surprises as the reader feels they are in the mind of Max as he reflects on the events of his childhood.  We are discovering what happened.  Max is looking back on them with the new perspective of a man with a lifetime of experience behind him. <br /> <br />There is very little literature as good as this out there.  Highly recommended.
B00013M6NK|5.0|I bought this battery as a back up to the one that came with my camera and I am pleasantly surprised at how long it stays charged.  I use my camera almost everyday and I've only had to change it twice. I highly recommend it.
B000A59PMO|3.0|Veronica Mars en su primera temporada, es una serie apenas aceptable. Muy lenta y con pocos personajes interesantes, en momentos aburre. <br />El personaje principal esta bastante bien logrado y salva con buena nota la mayoria de los capitulos. <br />Va de menos a mas, mejorando bastante conforme llega al final, lo que deja una esperanza para la segunda temporada. <br /> <br />
B000H5V8DG|5.0|I'm short of words... I've received the Rambaldi Box on the 23th of December 2006 and today is the 4th and I've looked all of the DVD's already... I've heard from the Serie long time ago, but I don't have a TV so I couldn't watch it... and when I saw this Box I thought \\"You must have this!\\" and really, it's breath taking if you receive it... I was a bit worried because most of the Reviewers wrote that the Disc are useless or scratched... but mine weren't... I received a wonderful, and just genious Box full of Action and Love... hehe... So if you have doubts to buy this, forget them... It's beside 24 my new best TV-Serie!!!
B000HEWEE4|4.0|If you're feeling in the mood for lighthearted romance, this is a good pick.  No doubt it's a \\"chic flick\\"--I mean really, Sandra Bullock & Keanu Reeves. But one could easily lure/sucker her guy into watching it by saying that \\"there's stuff in it about time travel and it's got that guy from The Matrix.\\"  Seriously, I enjoyed it--it switches back and forth quite a bit so that keeps it from being completely mindless entertainment--you actually have to pay attention to keep the time frame straight--but it's still a very solid choice for diversion from \\"real life\\" for a couple of hours.
0743487486|3.0|I found the book very interesting, and it challenged many of my guiding premises about parenting.  I had always considered myself a patient, loving Mom..But Alfie set me straight!!  No, seriously..I agree with him that it is necessary to consider a child's needs, valuable to consider their feelings, and important to respect them as individuals....But, there is a lot to be said for controlling their behavior and avoiding bedlam in your home.  He equates allowing children to experience natural consequenses with punishing and spanking..all tantamount to withdrawal of love..and he goes too far.   <br />I'm glad I've read it, and would reccomend it as PART OF a parenting library...But the ideals presented are not realistic, as the author himself admits when he says that he uses consequenses when absolutly needed.  I like the concept that our goal as parents should be studied, and our parenting choices should fit that goal.  there is value in this book..But it's far from a \\"How To\\" raise great people kind of book..Lots of theory and condemnation of current practices..and lots to think about.
B00006BTCA|4.0|On this album, Interpol brought a fresh guitar-driven sound to the 2002 alternative rock scene.  Comparisons to the Psychedelic Furs and Joy Division are fair ones (likely due to the darker melodies and lyrics), however the band utilizes a slightly harder style that provides some unique results.  More often than not, the music takes center stage over the mumbled and/or reverbed vocals, and \\"Turn On..\\" features a plethora of guitar harmonies that harken back to the days of Thin Lizzy.  A great album overall that starts strong but begins to tail-off towards the end...if you like \\"Turn On..\\" then be sure to pickup \\"Antics\\", Interpol's follow-up record.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I hold a Master's degree in Atmospheric Science and have attended many meetings and conferences held by the American Meteorological Society. During my early studies in the mid 80's, there was a heated debate, no pun intended, among professionals if global warming caused by increased Carbon dioxide emissions existed. The debate is over. Most recent studies have acknowledged the fact that C02 levels are sharply increasing and are directly contributing to rising global temperatures. This DVD provides documented evidence of this. Sure, the Earth has experienced several warming and cooling periods in the past but nothing to the extent of what is now occurring. I highly recommend that everyone view this compelling documentary.     UPDATED Jan 4:  Mr. Keech. I read your comment. Thanks for the comic relief this morning. My colleagues and I found your desperate and inflated rebuttal largely entertaining. We noticed how you have relentlessly posted your exhausting plea to anyone who enjoyed the DVD. Good luck with your crusade. See you at the AMS conference this month in San Antonio? Will you be presenting?
B00008PC2O|1.0|The film is briliant but the high def version dont work outside the US, I dont think Amazon should allow this to be sold or dispached outside the US.
0618680004|4.0|Having grown up with very liitle  religous education, I wasn't threatened by this book, and very open to the information that Dawkins presented. (which probably colours my interpretation) I imagine that anyone with strong religous beliefs would find this book unsettling, though perhaps more the reason you should read it...<br /><br />I remember at the age of eight being sent to the corner for asking my scripture teacher \\"how they knew\\" regarding god and all that. Although if anything my scripture teachers reaction  increased my uncertainity, In reading Richard Dawkins, I somehow didn't feel so foolish for asking my scripture teacher all those years back for  PROOF.<br /><br />This is a interesting read, nomatter what your opinion or beliefs of God..<br /><br />Very imformative and easy to read. I don't think believing in a god is bad if it makes you happy or your life on Earth worthwhile....I still believe that , even after reading this book. I think that is Dawkins belief too, though I cannot speak for him. His protest is the violence and hatred that so called religion has inflicted on humans  towards others who believe something different.
B000002GMT|3.0|Of course it can not possibly live up to the Abba Gold collection as that contained all their big hits, but that is not to say that you should avoid this cd. If you only know the top 10 hits of Abba then this album offers you a chance to hear some beautifully crafted songs that you may not be familiar with, but still feature the girls' lovely vocals. If you're only after the hits don't bother but if you want to discover more of the real Abba give this one a try as well.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|I have always enjoyed the movie. <br />I loved the friendship that was between the two main stars, and how they grew over the years. <br />
B000JBXXZ4|3.0|i think Light Grenades is a very good and very well put together album, my only complaint is that Earth to Bella pretty much destroys it(Boyd sounds like he's whining!, almost reminds me of the Stones with Angie), every other track is good.  I do agree with other users in that some tracks sound crowish, but overall its a good album, not their best, but good nonetheless.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|What more can be said about this album that hasn't already been echoed in each positive review so far? George Martin has crafted a beautiful valentine to the boys and their very devoted and ever growing fan base. If I had one (very minor) complaint, it would be that there's no visual to accompany the Audio DVD. The experience of listening to LOVE would be that much cooler if I could watch mash up videos for each song (the 'Real Love' video is coming to mind, minus the footage of them today) I understand this is the soundtrack to a CSD show, but until I get to see the show in Vegas, watching footage of them while listening to this would just be the cherry on top. As it is, listening to LOVE in all it's 5.1 DTS surround sound glory is a very emotional and (at times) spiritual experience. Now if we could only get this same treatment for their entire catalog! It's the best music there is, and they were the best band that ever was. Period.
B000GIXEIG|4.0|Not that there are many film versions of the Beowulf legend to choose from, but this recent adaptation by director Sturla Gunnarson is definitely worth a look.  Shot entirely on location in Iceland, this film offers a breathtaking look at the real world these characters would have inhabited.   <br /> <br />And that very reality is precisely what gives this film its power.  Gunnarson takes the story of Beowulf almost entirely out of the realm of myth and places it as close to reality as one might without removing it from all relevance.  Beowulf as a character is already dealing with his growing reputation as a hero and monster-slayer, yet he remains a human man who must deal with a perceived superhuman nemesis.  The treatment of the monster Grendel is rather unique and one can even interpret his depiction as a throwback to neanderthal man or some other precursor or subsect of homo-sapien evolution.  He is similar to a yeti or sasquatch, yet treated with dignity and allowed far more emotional depth and range than many would usually allow for such a creature. <br /> <br />Gunnarson obviously has been heavily influenced by John Gardner's Grendel, which retells the beowulf myth from the point of view of the monster.  Gunnarson remains as true to the story as possible considering the choices he makes in telling his version of the story. <br /> <br />The scenery of the film is nothing short of gorgeous and for those with a predisposition for the harsh stark landscapes of medieval Scandinavia this film will in no way disappoint.  The settings are kept minimal and efficient, as the cultures depicted would have practiced in reality.  There are no shining palaces of gold or massive castles on a hilltop.  This is not the Lord of the Rings.  It is however a truly magnificent movie about vikings and one of the rare few to boast such a mantle.   <br /> <br />The only other recent film which bears comparison is John McTiernan's 13th Warrior, based on the novel Eaters of the Dead byMichael Crichton.  That film is likewise a retelling of the Beowulf myth but it goes in a completely alternate direction and suffers greatly from a profound lack of historical accuracy despite its attempt to appear 'plausible.'   <br /> <br />The only questionable moments in Gunnarson's version are his depiction of the climactic fight between the hero and the monster (here it has been made deliberately anti-climactic) and also the way the relationships between Beowulf, the monster and the witch play out.   <br /> <br />Stellar performances are turned in by almost all members of the cast, especially Stellan Skarsgård as King Hrothgar and, of course, Gerard Butler as Beowulf himself.   <br /> <br />For those just interested in a slick medieval action/thriller, check ou the local video store and give this one a look.  For more serious fans of medieval legend/myth/folklore or especially avid buffs of the Beowulf legend itself, this one is worth the money. Buy it.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|I can replay this CD over and over and over.  It is just so beautifully done and here voice is so angelic.  For those that compare her to others...I am sorry there is no comparison out there.  She is on her on level.  I recommend this CD to everyone.  There is so much feeling there.  I will always be a fan of Corrine Bailey Rae!!!
6302182530|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised that this is a great family movie!  The acting is above average, especially John Phillip Law's performance.  He is outstanding as the humble hero.  Just remember the special effects are not George Lucas quality, but for the era in which this film was made, they are very good.  Don't miss this charming movie!!
B0009A40ES|5.0|Ahhhh....Christian Bale.  Need I say more.  I had heard about this movie but never saw it until last year.  I was very impressed.  Definitely a black comedy about a serial killer jumping into total madness.  Or is he??  Definitely a classic to keep.  Love the use of humor in killing with the 80's music.  Such a decadent decade.
B000JJRIP2|4.0|The Sound quality of Alive I,II,III, and the Millenium show are really excellent. Alive I and II are now offered in this collection with better sound quality then originally offered on the Remasters. I also like having them on one disc which is more convenient. <br />The biggest complaint I have is with Universal...what a crap job of just throwing 2000 Man and God of Thunder at the end of the Millenium show. They didn't even take the time to consider where they would fit in the show. It just shows a lack of effort by somone that's for sure, and I don't really think Gene and Paul were that involved with this, but if they were, shame on them too. So, I think that really stinks. Having said that, I'm glad to finally have that show, but it is very fixed up and it's not as good as the \\"The Last Kiss\\" - which was a Pay Per View event for those who remember and are lucky enough to have snagged a boot of the whole show. But, oh well. <br />I would love at some point to have a live cd of all the unreleased live stuff from the 70s like is on \\"You Wanted the Best..\\" but include the Dynasty stuff, the Solo stuff, etc. That would almost be like where Alive III should have truly fallen. <br />
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I had never seen a performance and had only heard a couple of the songs from Wicked before I bought this CD.  After listening to the whole thing several times during a drive across the state, I'm anxious to be in the audience of a performance!  The music and singers are great, and the story comes through even if you don't know that much about it. If you love musicals, this one is a must have!
0780624890|5.0|I received my movie right away.  I didn't have to wait and worry about thinking where my movie was. The service and delivery is superb and fast. Thank You. I would buy from the seller again.
020530902X|5.0|Anyone who writes more than one sentence at a time needs a copy of Strunk and White's ELEMENTS OF STYLE -- especially young people, and particularly if you're in college.  This is the classic and it will never go out of style.  All the basics are here for you to write in simple, cogent and clear English.  As far as style, spelling, punctuation, sentence and paragraph construction, you just can't go wrong following the guidelines in this little book.
B000EJ9MTW|4.0|I warily stepped into this CD -- it being recommended by my brother, who had also recommended The Vines, Jet, and Green Day.  None of the last 3 bands does anything for me.  I grew up with Zeppelin, Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, and AC/DC, and have yet to find anything comparable in the last 25 years (Rush's Vapor Trails is excellent however). This time, I struck gold.  This CD is fantastic.  I hesitate giving it 5 stars, because it is pretty basic.  But I hold 5 stars to gems such as Machine Head or LZ 1-4.  Someone commented that the lyrics are a joke - but listen to the lyrics of Whole Lotta Love.  Lyrics are important, but the songs matter most.  All of the songs on this CD are good - and most are great.  If they can develop,like Zeppelin did (but Purple never did), they could turn out to be a phenom.  However, they could turn out to be a one-CD wonder.  My usual question for rating a CD is  - will I listen to this 5 years from now??  I'm pretty sure I will.  Rock and roll needs a good comeback amongst all the garbage that is out there.  Please let rap die and rock flourish.
B00005JNTX|5.0|Though I've never seen the comic book, everybody involved in the making of this movie did a wonderful job.  I have never seen a movie like this.  Loved the noirish quality.  Definitely great humor for those with a twisted sense.  This movie has it all - sex, murder, love, revenge, justice, obsession, humor.... and a fine-looking cast.
B000021Y7X|5.0|Easily one of the best concerts ever filmed. The music of Talking Heads is accessible while being eccentric, seminal yet good clean American fun. I had a chance to meet Jerry Harrison on this tour, which I saw in Hampton (Norfolk), Virginia. It still ranks as the best concert I've ever attended. I've attended over 100. David Byrne shows why he is considered a musical genius with a blend of musical styles that makes his music as listenable now as it was in the '70s and '80s. Best song - \\"Once in a Lifetime.\\"
B0007XT87G|5.0|This is perhaps the greatest unknown band of our time. Apparently bareknown here in the US this band has finally started to get the exposure they deserve. If you like Pink Floyd, Coldplay, Radiohead or even STP... you certainly will like this gem. Buy this and Absentia... then try Stupid Dream.... you won't be sorry.
6305428042|5.0|This is a movie for all ages. I highly recommend it. A classic that you can watch over & over again & never tire of it.
0800141660|5.0|With a such a cast as this, who could have expected anything but sucess for this movie. Emma Thompsen is absolutely charming! And for all you HOuse fans out there, it's another side of that man who plays that grummpy character. I really love this film!!!
0393061434|5.0|It is a very interesting and entertaining book. Steve Wozniak writes a lot about his young years' formation and all problems that may bring to a young person. He is not shy to disclose his inner feelings while growing into the adult society. <br />He brings a lot of light into the early beginnings of Apple Inc. and how it all started. <br /> <br />The book may feel a bit (10 years or more?) too late to come to the market, with the freshest news being YouTube (late last year) or Google (a few years ago), but it's still a very good read. Highly recommended!!!
B0007KTBIU|5.0|I love the movie Pocahontas because it offers a great, practical story with a very strong lesson.  Most movies for children try to do this, but my daughter even understands the need for peace in this movie and relates it to the peace we need in our world today.  GREAT MOVIE!
B000FTWB7G|5.0|This is by far the best CD I own to date. Everyone should really go buy it the vocals are great the band is awesome it in a whole is a magnificent piece of artwork. Go Buy IT NOW!
B000B5UL7G|5.0|I liked this CD from the very start.  Some (like Rudebox) have to grow on you - this one was an instant hit with me.  Like most of the tunes; of course tripping is a favorite.
B000HEWEEE|5.0|Excellent romantic and nerve wracking movie.  You can't wait for the fairy tail ending.  Leaves you wanting for more.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|With two films in 2006 featuring magic (the other the more commerical The Prestige), one is bound to make comparisons, but this movie stands alone not as one the best films about magic this year but as one of the best films this year!<br /><br />Edward Norton commands the screen, Jessica Biel is ethereal, and Paul Giamatti again proves why he is one of the best character actors around today.<br /><br />Visually stunning, intelligently written, and superbly acted, one cannot find any flaws in this master work.<br /><br />If you have to see one magic film this year, let it be this one.<br /><br />For 2006, only two other films matched this one in quality - The Departed and Casino Royale.<br /><br />The pure brillance of this film is no illusion. Run, don't walk to the nearest movie house and be amazed.
B0001XAPY2|5.0|At first i was unsure that i should buy this movie because the plot seemed kinda sketchy and not clear. However, i judged too quickly because i took a gamble and i bought it and it was not a mistake. The movie has a great plot and great classic animation taht works with the movie. In addition, this movie has hidden messages that will reveal itself later in the movie.
B00020HEL6|5.0|Renee has such a beautiful voice and this CD is great. It relaxes me while I'm driving. I highly recommend it.
0399215980|2.0|We decided to purchase this book for our toddler after she enjoyed the copy we had checked out of our local library.  She had loved turning the pages and looking at the large pictures of each animal.  Sadly, this copy was smaller than a postcard.  When we read the copy from the library, I liked the idea of a book that tells a story with very little text, encouraging the reader to create his or her own.  The way each animal's tail appears on the page teaches little readers to turn the pages in a book to reveal the narrative.  I was disappointed that this edition has dialogue in which each animal rejects the mouse.  I would have prefered the larger, textless edition.  When ordering, pay attention to the dimensions!
B00008BXJ6|4.0|Ac/Dc are a band unlike any other.In a world of change this band has stuck to it's guns and has not changed no matter what the musical climate.Many critizize the band for this but I say it takes guts to believe in yourself that much that you don't care what your peers are doing. Look at what happened in the late 90s when grunge overtook the world,it would have been so easy for Ac/Dc to water down their sound to fit in but they never did.Right to the end they played the same high energy music with screaming vocals and searing guitars played to a blues rhythm.Many have tried to imitate them but no one has succeded because blues music (which is what this is based in) can't be taught or copied,it comes from the heart.Now,let me go on with the review of High Voltage in particular. This is one of the very best Ac/Dc CD's ever recorded.Other than Highway To Hell,this is the best Bon Scott fronted CD's ever.Every song is instantly memorable,and is also easy to sing along with.Starting with \\"It's A Long Way To The Top\\" which is the perfect opening song for a rock band,to the amazingly catchy \\"Rock N Roll Singer\\" to one of the greatest sing a long songs ever \\"The Jack\\" basically there is not a single bad song in the bunch.TNT and Little Lover are my personal favorites from this CD but there honestly is not one bad song. Many people have put this band down because Angus didn't play a million notes a second like Eddie Van Halen or Yngwie but Angus could say it all with 3 notes bent with feeling.Most guitar players out there don't understand that.Angus is a master of feeling.Ac/Dc is all about making the listener \\"feel\\" the music,not just listen to it. Many have also given negative reviews to Bon's vocals,sure he didn't have the highest range but he had something even more special,he had a very distinctive voice,when you heard an Ad/Dc song you KNEW it was him singing...to a lesser degree Brian Johnson carried on that tradition with Back in Black and beyond...it is crucial for a singer to be distinctive and Bon's voice fit PERFECTLY with this music. This is a true masterpiece,not just for all fans of hard rock and metal but for fans of rock and roll period,because while it does have it's heavy moments it also has lots of rhythm and blues and a lot of soul.Absolutely you should buy this CD.<br /><br />The upside:A great CD,filled with catchy songs,the highlights are \\"Tnt\\" \\"Little Lover\\" \\"The jack\\" \\"High Voltage\\" \\"It's A Long Way\\",\\"Rock And Roll Singer\\",and \\"Live Wire\\" (realizing I mentioned nearly every song,but that's seriously how good this is)<br /><br />The downside:Ac/Dc never changes,for many this is a bad thing,you can ALWAYS know what to expect from them.You won't ever find a disco song or a rap song or a country song on an Ac/Dc album.There are no surprises.However,in my book that's a good thing.If you want great dancable rock and roll that you can sing along,you always know you can rely on Ac/Dc...aside from all the albums having the same style (which is good in my opinion) there are no downsides at all<br /><br />The bottom line:Good time rock and roll at it's best.It won't make you think too hard,it's easy to remember and fun to sing along and dance to.You should run not walk to buy this,the donutman says so!!!singer to be distinctive and Bon's voice fit PERFECTLY with this music.

B000FTWB7G|5.0|I bought this album, based on a review given for a book called Twilight (by: Stephenie Meyer). The reviewer said to listen to this as I read the book, bc it went along beautifully with the storyline.<br /><br />She was right.<br /><br />I already have Evanescence's other CD, and I really like it, but this one is amazing!!!<br /><br />The feel of it, is eerie, a Gothic experience like no other. Alone or listening to it as you read, will do...just listen to it. It is beautiful.<br /><br />Truly.<br /><br />Amy Lee has a voice like an angel, then combined with fantastic music, Evanescence reins supreme!
B000C65Z1G|3.0|Like LeCarre's books, this is an adult story, full of details.  Very little sex or obvious violence, the kids will be bored after 10 min. <br />Remember the excel.  BBC productions of Smiley's . . .? well, this is only 2 hr long, so a lot of the detailed set pieces are changed or just left out. I read the book first, so my first view of the Constant Gardener was a disappointment. It seemed better when I watched a second time and just  watched as a movie. <br />While reading the book, I looked up places on a map, there is a Lochi, etc.  I don't know if the actual places are in the film, but the DVD notes say it was in Kenya, and the African visual appearance is excel. <br />For a film based in Africa, there is very little use of African caracters in the film, it's Euro thru and thru. <br />I'll just mention one plot point that irritates me - Tessa had a disasterous childbirth failure, hardly mentioned at all. As this was an event in the movie /book, wouldn't there be some development of the parents reaction to losing a baby?  espec. as Tessa went to a disadvantaged hospital instead of going to Europe for birth ? Mostly left out of movie, She was very rich, I would think there would have been strong reaction. <br />A movie that plants ideas more than instant entertainment, to be forgotten the next day,  3 + stars.
B0000028W9|4.0|This is a good CD for background music or long trips in the car.  The lyrics are worth listening to without the music.  Leonard Cohen is a great poet.
B000GG4Y32|5.0|This movie illistrates the rise of communism and how some Americans became involved with it.This edition has interesting comments from Warren Betty who starred in , as well as, directed the movie.
0743298020|4.0|The initial premise of the book was fascinating.  The back story, only briefly laid out in the novel, could have easily been another entire book.  The story progressed, but the charachters did not develop along with the plot.  In the end, the intracate story abruptly stopped, with an all too simple and tidy resolution.  This complex tale could have used a more complex ending.  Overall, a good read.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|Although a slightly different style from their previous albums, Evanescence has brought another great album to the scene.  While the album as a whole is definitely different from their other albums (namely Fallen), this one has a similar feel and relative style (meaning the songs to the other songs in the album) that Fallen had.  I highly recommend this for anyone that likes Evanescence, Lacuna Coil or any other band of that style.

B000GTLQXU|4.0|An excellent remake of a classic movie.  They made enough changes to keep it exciting all the way through the end.  It has great special effects and a decent plot.
0618680004|3.0|I have a dislike of all missionaries, and Richard Dawkins is a missionary.  He tries to sell me atheism in an infuriating 'in your face' manner.  One of the problems with the book is that the God that Dawkins doesn't believe in is the Christian God.  There is very little about Islam and Judaism - and what there is is predictably negative; and certainly, as far as Judaism is concerned, there are gross misunderstandings - and in one case a most unacademic misrepresentation of facts.  I do not recall that Buddhism and Hinduism are mentioned even once.  A fascinating topic spoiled, for me, by the infuriating manner of the author's presentation.
B000IJ79WU|5.0|Richard Donner knew what he was doing with this movie.  A better rendition due to decent editing, basic storyline and inter-relational character development.  Vast improvement!
B00000G3AZ|5.0|THIS IS A VERY FINE MOVIE TO WATCH, BECAUSE OF THE SCENERY, THE COSTUMES, AND THE FINE ACTING, EXCEPTIONAL, STUNNING, BREATHTAKING.
B000JK8OYU|3.0|I'll start by saying that I haven't seen the musical. That might make this product more meaningful, but no more than a typical soundtrack.    What you have with the CD is a montage of Beatles moments from their albums, singles, and even some of the Anthology series thrown in. Most songs appear in bits which come and go in a flash. Others are played out a little more, and a few get most of the way through in their original forms. It's a tapestry of Beatles moments all woven together--within, without--old and new mashed together. Almost a Beatles dream sequence.     The Beatles' original producer, George Martin and his son were the production team for this CD. From a production standpoint, it is fantastic. Their talent (as well as the quality of the tapes recorded long ago)really shines through. You must remember they were putting much of this together \\"made-to-order\\" to go with the vision of the \\"Love\\" muscial staff. The quality of most of the sound makes you long for a full remastering of the origingal Beatles albums using the same equipment. (Or how about the \\"Get Back\\" sessions in their entirety!)    But, unfortunately, there are some problems with this project. These problems are especially those which have to deal with efforts to make the Beatles appealing to fans of \\"the modern sound\\". Ringo's drums tying two songs together in perfect sync with the underlying beat takes us right into the modern club. However, \\"clubbing Beatles\\" just doesn't do it for me. (It's almost Silly Love Songs!) Another problem is that some of the songs seem really bass heavy. Get Back is totally ruined due to the pounding of the bass. My fifteen-year-old reached out and turned down the volume when it was on in my car. So much for appealing to the younger generation! (And I don't think the Beatles aim of getting back to their roots for the \\"Get Back/Let It Be\\" project included bass enhancement!)    Well, we have to remember that this is the soundtrack to the musical. But how little information is included about the stage presentation! What gives? We get a booklet of vague photographs, but that's about all.     So, we are left with the CD on its own, but why do we really want to listen to Beatles songs this way? When you put a mix CD or tape together, doesn't the fixed order get a little tiring? That's when you might hit the random button, but that won't work very well for this CD.    I can't imagine too many people listening to this CD more than about five times. I've talked with some others who feel the same way:    First listen: Cool! Very interesting!  Second listen: Oh, yeah. I like that part. (and) I didn't notice that the first time.  Third listen: Oh, yeah. That part.   Fourth listen: I feel like I've heard it all before. (and) Man, this thing goes on forever!  Fifth listen: ??? (There may not be a fifth listen.)    Well, maybe a dozen listens for some. But considering how new this CD is, and how many are already being sold used here at Amazon, I think quite a few people probably feel this way.     And when you really think about it, there are infinite arrangements that could be made from pieces of Beatle songs. It could be made into a series with hundreds of volumes! The individual tracks could even be sold in a software package and users could put their own mixes together. Dissected Beatles, Frankenstein Beatles...Wouldn't that be cool? But in the end, you have to ask yourself, \\"What's the point?\\" How many listens does it deserve?    But, if you're a true fan, like me, you know you have to have it. Just for the experience. For me, (for the first three times) the Mr. Kite/She's So Heavy blend/segue was a powerfully moving experience! But, now, like Let It Be Naked, it has been experienced.     As with all the other \\"post-Beatles\\" Beatles projects I own, \\"Love\\" has now been relegated to the \\"about once-a-year\\" rotation.
B000H305U0|5.0|this cd is HOT. It's new music for JT and i like it. It works for him. My favorite track is \\"my love\\". I would higly reccommend this cd to even people who didnt like his music in the past, he has really improved.
B000ATQYT2|4.0|This first attempt of Jim Henson and Co. to retell a classic story remains their most successful to date. Michael Caine's performance as Scrooge is a bit wooden, but works because one really just wants to see the Muppets. The movie has at it's centre Gonzo the Great and Rizo the Rat, who steal the show, while Kermit's role as Bob Cratchit is minimal but classic. The music is rather good, and the whole look of the movie is full to overflowing with Muppet quaintness. Of the Muppet movies this is the best in striking a balance between appealing to children while providing real laughs for adults.
0307341542|4.0|This book took off slowly for me but as I read more I was sorry to see the story end.  It has a really good ending.  Some parts may seem implausible if not impossible but I really enjoyed it.  If the main character showed up in a later book by this author it wouldn't surprise me.  I can't give the book 5 stars because it just doesn't have the quality of authorship or a tremendously great storyline but for a general fiction book it has a pretty neat tale and keeps your attention.  I recommend reading this book.
B0002S947K|5.0|A big success, great voice, knows exactly how to make good music <br />In one word a precious jewel......
B000GIXEIG|5.0|I loved it...It really had a strong emotional pull towards grendal's character...You found it hard to hate him and found yourself a little angry with Beowulf's character.  This movie isn't for a lot of people, if you need action or for a movie to start on the ball and keep rolling this isn't for you.  If you like story-lines and maybe the epic poem itself than this is definitely a must see!!  You start of with Beowulf's character and as he travels to help out a mighty King that once helped him he goes to realize this man in front of him, this broken-down, hopeless man is the king, what's left of him.  He's determined to fight for him and get his honor back.  But as Beowulf digs deeper into the enemy that is Grendal, he learns about secrets and untold whole truths and starts to wonder about the kings trustworthiness.  He has to kill Grendal for the kings sake, but he also meets a woman to help open his eyes. HIss inner turmoil makes this a Great emotional movie, Gerard Butler did an awesome Beowulf!  His character really came a live and made you feel what  beowulf felt.  MUST SEE!
B000A5TJA2|5.0|MUSICAL/SPY SATIRE SPOOF BY THE BEATLES-Stop worrying! HELP! is on the way! The Beatles 2nd film has an obscure Indian cult of Kali that believes in human sacrifice after Ringo who has accidentally put on the victim's ceremonial ring. He is pursued by the Indian cult of Kali, a pair of mad scientists, & a member of a side cult that no longer believes in human sacrifice and the London police who are trying to help!    Includes: Leo Mckern, Kali cult leader, in his sari, drinking tea &  discussing his religious beliefs with an Anglican priest. Of the Beatles, John and Ringo have most of the funny lines & exaggerates the idea of George being tight with his money:playing poker with Ringo at Buckingham Palace, pilfering rings from a jeweler, making Ringo pick up the tab at a pub. Songs that \\"Help!(& The Movie's Title Song) popularized are You're Gonna Lose That Girl, Ticket to Ride,You've Got to Hide Your Love Away,The Night Before, Another Girl, I Need You!Color, 90 minutes!Like MTV before there was such a thing. The Monkees TV Show and band's image was based on this film by Richard Lester!

This movie is great for all ages and I highly recommend it. It deserves a oscar for best animation, music, so on. Congrats to Disney (Pixar) again! Being a Child of the 50's I grew up with Disney and their stories have brought so much joy to Our lives.

0618477942|5.0|A must read for all Alison Bechdel fans everywhere. Uniquely wonderful paired with her gifted cartoon images as she tells the story of her life and that of her parents in small town PA. I am not just saying this because she grew up an hour away from me, but she captures the freakish, stifling small town life of a not yet out (and for her Dad tragically never 0ut) young woman with talent living in an Addams family time warp. . . This book is dark, moody, deliciously hard to put down!! <br />Gay readers owe it to themselves to read this incredibly open, self exposing family portrait of the generations growing into themselves. <br />Ms. Bechdel has touched many of us deeply trying to make sense of some fairly creepy, freakishly isolated odd childhoods. <br />Her writing is equal to her art/illustrations and DTWOF cartoons we have all been enjoying for decades.
B000H0MKGK|4.0|I've been a fan of Mr. Mayer since 2000, when songs from Room for Squares were hitting the air waves.  I've loved his music from the start, and Continuum still doesn't disappoint.  As with all albums, you gotta listen to all tracks about 3-4 times before you can truly understand the lyrics and let the rhythms get under your skin.  Each track is unique and still full of soul.  My personal favorite is \\"The Heart of Life\\", speaking to the genuiune good of each person, stranger or friend, we may find in our lives, and to always be positive and optimistic - a great rule to live by.  I highly recommend this album, and if you're not a fan of John, I suggest you come check him out and see what he's all about.

B000HCO840|3.0|I don't want to get into a lot of detail here. There are many reviews that can give you facts. My seat of the pants feeling about this movie is that they once again found the established Marvel history line to be too dificult to convey so they changed key facts and features of the Xmen and their world to make the movie easier to produce. In the same way that Fantastic four was \\"adapted\\" to a movie so has the last Xmen movie. In my opinion , the effects make it worth seeing but it's really just not true to the Xmen universe.

B000AQJPQE|5.0|Planets rotate on 2 tracks to give the illusion that the planets are all moving at different speeds (an effective illusion).<br /><br />It would have been nice if the ring of Saturn were semi translucent plastic rather than cardboard.<br /><br />Since Pluto has been downgraded from planetary status you can perhaps hang the Star Trek Enterprise orbiting the outer solar system, the Borg cube, or the Death Star (the geek potential is high with this...)

6304712936|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time. It has less to do about the genius of Mozart than the genius of F. Murray Abraham, who delivers one of the finest acting I have ever seen. Abraham plays the role of Antonio Salieri, who had been promoted to the rank of kapellmeister (chief Royal music-maker) in the Vienna court of the late 18th century.<br /><br />The movie begins with an attempted suicide of Salieri. His unsuccessful attempt to die is followed by his residence in an asylum, where a piano is also furnished for his enjoyment. The story really begins when a priest visits Salieri to listen what the latter has to say and bring some comfort to his misery. Alas, Salieri's misery hardly subsides when the priest fails to recognize any of Salieri's works as the deranged man plays melody after melody, which were once \\"the joy of Vienna\\". Oh but wait, he says, how about this one. Unbeknownst to the priest Salieri plays a simple melody familiar to both the man of God and the person watching the movie. Oh that's charming! exclaims the priest. I didn't know you wrote that, says the priest with new found respect for the ill man. And the introduction to the story ends when Salieri says: I didn't. That was Mozart.<br /><br />The story flows with the transformation of Salieri's character. From his innocent childhood to an ambitious career-oriented musician, whose sole purpose in life is his music and he works very hard to be recognized for it. But Nature works in mysterious ways. It humbles hard workers by showing there is always someone better. So much better in fact humility turns to mediocrity and sometimes into raging jealousy, and so the seeds of a story are sowed.
1592401791|5.0|If you'd like to see why Geoff Emerick is important, pull out your copy of Revolver, and then a couple of other CDs by the Beatles's mid-60s crosstown rivals, like the Who or the Stones.  Listen on headphones.  Notice the difference?  Like, on the Beatles album, you can actually hear the bass guitar?  Emerick was part of a crack team at EMI, headed by George Martin, who produced these groundbreaking sounds using technology based in vacuum tubes and scissors.<br /><br />As a serious Beatlemaniac, I was excited to hear Emerick's take on things.  I've read a fair selection of books about the Fabs, ranging from Lewisohn's obsessive documentation of their recording sessions to Goldman's ridiculous Lennon bio.  Here, There and Everywhere might just be the best of the lot.<br /><br />Emerick had not only privileged access to the boys at work during some seminal album sessions, he also has the rare gift of seeing them as actual human beings, with all the flashes of brilliance rounded by a dash of annoying quirks.  He was so stung by one of Lennon's barbs that he actually walked out on recording the White Album (imagine!), but nonetheless admires John's genius, and even credits Yoko where he thinks credit is due.<br /><br />Smart anecdotes abound.  One I found most striking was Yoko, recovering from a car crash, holding her own personal bed-in inside the studio during the recording of Abby Road.  Ah, I miss the 60s!<br /><br />There's also a bit of technical information (Emerick is, after all, an engineer), but don't be intimidated.  As Elvis Costello comments in his gracious introduction, most of the stories seem to involve a charming jury-rigged MacGyver-style solution involving sticky tape and rubber bands.  Many of the best involve the professional musicians who interacted with the Beatles for various recordings--they were reluctant to turn down what was definitely the best gig in England, but nevertheless disconcerted by the men sticking microphones in their faces and persuading them to play wearing pig noses.<br /><br />One note of caution:  before you start reading, make sure you have your CDs as well as your Anthology DVDs nearby--you'll definitely want to grab everything and give it a new listen.faces and persuading them to play wearing pig noses. <br /> <br />One note of caution:  before you start reading, make sure you have your CDs as well as your Anthology DVDs nearby--you'll definitely want to grab everything and give it a new listen.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|Serenity, the name of both the first and final installments of the Firefly series, is a fantastic movie.  If you're into films that appeal to most men: war movies, action, westerns, sci-fi, comedies, then you'll like this show and I recommend it without reservation, but I also recommend watching the entire series (14 episodes)first; I saw the movie before I had ever heard of the TV Show, and it was entertaining, but I felt as though I was outside of an inside joke.  After watching the rest of the story, the movie is the appropriate capstone.
B000F8O35U|4.0|I have wanted this DVD to come out for years.  I missed my chance when The Little Mermaid came out for the first time on DVD, but this special edition is so much better.  It has a lot of extra features, and a new animated short that's really good.  This is my favorite movie of all time and I love this DVD.
B000EGCITG|1.0|She writes a song about Bush, deriding him for alcohol abuse and drug use in his youth, and then she also writes a song about how much fun it is to get drunk all the time! <br /> <br />She writes a song about materialism and about the poor people who cannot have such luxury, then she also writes a song about her excessive materialism on the same album! <br /> <br />Other commenters call her \\"brave\\" or whatever for \\"taking a stand\\" against the President. Instead, I find her hypocritical grandstanding quite pathetic and insincere, and I think that only the simplest of minds would be swept up in adoration for this confused pop-tart.  <br /> <br />Judging by the 5-star reviews, I have to assume that Pink's childish anti-Bush tirade and her glaring inconsistencies are small change when compared to her allegedly awesome abilities as a songwriter and musician. <br /> <br />The music on this CD is not bad, much of it is catchy and is great to dance to. But I have trouble taking someone seriously when they cannot even recognize their own hypocrisy. Pink is an entertaining pop star who provides young teenage girls with some sort of role-model/counter-culture figure to look up to, which is also disappointing. <br /> <br />I am no die-hard fan of the President, but it is ridiculous to have a semi-educated pop star deriding the President while at the same time promoting the same types of drug use and greed! She is calling the kettle black. It's a shame that her fans cannot tell the difference between a hero and a hypocrit. <br /> <br />3 stars for a CD that features plenty of listenable music. It's nothing ground-breaking or genre-bending, but the songs are not bad enough to cause me to stand up and hit the \\"next\\" button. But those 3 stars are chopped down to 1 lonely star when her hypocrisy casts a shadow on the whole experience.

1593974744|4.0|I decided to get an Orson Scott Card book on tape to listen to while riding and to distract me while driving on business travel.  This was a good choice.  The narration was pleasant to listen to, communicated the feeling of the story well, and was fluid.  First book on tape; so far, so good.  I liked Card's story, but I was sure that I would after meeting him at a conference in 2005.  Carefully conceived and polished storytelling with interesting ideas and an unexpected twist that somehow made everything seem right.  Not over-the-top good, but certainly worth anybody's time to read/listen.
B00092ZL80|5.0|This is a great DVD!  Of course if you're not 40 or 50 years old you probably don't know who these guys are.  Both EWF and Chicago put on great shows and demonstrate that their musical abilities are still strong in this video, although Robert Lamm's vocals are considerably weaker than they used to be... but then again, at his age, whose isn't?  All the old hits are on this DVD and some tunes are performed by both groups together.  The non-original guitarists for both groups are noteworthy.  If you liked these 2 groups back in the 70's you will love this video.

0786886811|3.0|I love Nigella - and no, I am not a stalker!  I love her cooking shows, which are fast-paced, fun and very well produced visually.  I love her columns, though I always have to read them with considerable delay. I love her books (well at least How To Eat and the object of this review) because they are chock-full of great recipes and wit.   <br /> <br />However, as other readers have pointed out, some of the recipes in this book give incorrect amounts for the ingredients, which often results in a big disaster.  I have made the blueberry muffins and the orange chocolate cake and they turned out awful - the muffins were not sweet enough and had to be heavily smeared with jam; the cake was inedible, I had to throw it away.   <br /> <br />However, I made the banana bread (with cocoa and chocolate chips for my 2.5-year-old twins), the Madeira cake, the spice cake in the Christmas chapter and the rocky road chocolates from the Children chapter, and they all turned out pretty good.  I also tried out the white bread recipe shortly after buying the book when it came out, and it was a better recipe than average.  Finally, I made the strawberry jam, which was very good too - and very easy.  So it's not all bad. <br /> <br />In order to keep track of things, I have begun sticking post-it notes on the recipes that I try out with comments on what can be done to improve them (needs more sugar, never make this recipe again, good bread etc.).  I know this can sound like a pain in the neck, but many of the recipes in Nigella's archive are the result of \\"tweaking\\" other recipes, changing quantities, adding ingredients, so I feel like I am keeping with the spirit of the book.

0743270754|5.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin has added an important element to our understanding of Lincoln.  This a biography not just of one of our greatest presidents but of the politicians and administrators who were part of his cabinet, the Congress and his official family while he was in the White House.  She deftly illustrates Lincoln's \\"political genius\\" -- his ability to bind men who had run against him for president or otherwise opposed him by incorporating them into his cabinet and/or administration and earning first their respect and then their affection.  His brilliance and his extraordinary patience and generosity have never been more clearly illustrated. If a Bob Woodward or Frank Rich had written about Lincoln in the 1860s, this is probably the kind of insight readers would have had.

It is a fairly regular who-dunnit mixed with a returning-home theme, but with very nice insights all along the way.  Teenagers, Munchausen syndrome, lipstick, sexual politics, journalism, small town America...<br /><br />I read a book a day, mostly....and it is rare that I wake my wife to read out loud passages that have run my bell, and this novel is full of them.  It was a delightful read.  I put Ms. Flynn right up there with Connelly, Crais, Grisham, Iles, Burke, Deaver, Lehane....and I very much look forward to her next work

B000KX0HVY|4.0|Without question, Elvis has been the most anthologized artist in the nearly thirty years since his death. So how is this collection different from the others? The short answer is--nothing. If you're a die-hard fan, there's no reason to buy this.  But that's not true for the casual fan who's looking for a comprehensive overview of perhaps the most influential performer of the 20th Century.<br /><br />This mid-priced two-disc collection covers every aspects of Elvis's career, beginning with his first Sun single \\"That's All Right\\" through the 1977 single \\"Moody Blue,\\" which topped the country chart just months before his death. In between are hits from every stage of his career--50's rock 'n' roll classics like \\"Hound Dog,\\" movie hits like the million-seller \\"Viva Las Vegas\\" and comeback hits like \\"Suspicious Minds\\" (his first No. 1 in more than seven years!).<br /><br />Sure, there are missing tracks (including nine No. 1's, like \\"(Let Me Be Your)Teddy Bear,\\" \\"Stuck on You\\" and \\"Good Luck Charm\\"), but for the casual fan who only wants one anthology in their collection this works nicely. However, with a total playing time of less than two hours, it could have been more inclusive.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

What do the characters and their actions signify.  Some are obvious, but those are just clues to view the whole film as a metaphor for American Society.  The thesis of the film is around the camp fire spoken by Jack Nicholson.  Sorry if I've said too much.

6304907648|5.0|Other Amazon reviews bring out the strengths of this movie, including the strong plot line, Sigourney Weaver's acting and the excellence of the supporting cast.<br /><br />What seems to be underplayed in the reviews is just how beautiful -- not pretty -- is Holly Hunter's portrayal. So gentle, so vulnerable, so decent, so layered. No scene addresses even a hint of a personal life but you sense a deep depth in her character. In The Piano movie she showed the same resonance, playing a woman who does not speak. In that film she was the emotional still point in a vortex of passion, drawing superb performances from Harvey Keitel and Sam Neill. In Copycat she does the same.<br /><br />It's a fine film. It's even finer if you just focus your eyes and attention on Holly H in every single scene.
0743556003|1.0|I love just about everything Stephen King has ever written, even some of his more offbeat novels, but I could not for the life of me figure out what the plot was in this story. I found passages in the book that were repetitious, boring and distracting.  And what the heck is a \\"bool\\" anyway?  I only made it about a 1/3 way through the book before I gave up in frustration of ever finding a thread of a plot. Please Mr. King, the public is hungry for a really juicy horror novel again like Carrie or The Stand. Come back to us Mr. King!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|P&P is one of the jewels of English literature. It's very robust in that it is so open to different slants on it. This movie is a new slant and adds beautifully to the Ehle/Firth BBC interpretation. It's the more moving. Jennifer Ehle was my own perfect embodiment of Lizzie but Keira Knightley adds a dimension of extraordinary unfolding of the internal turmoil of Lizzie and her kindness -- the scenes with Jane are so subtle in their deep love for each other. Matthew Mcfadyen is a completely different Darcy from Colin Firth's but far more resonant. It is interesting to see Judi Dench in the film as the dreadful Lady Catherine. I am an old Brit who saw her in many performances on stage -- I think Keira K signals in this film that she is in the same league and on the same growth path.<br /><br />Critics of the film point out that it plays around somewhat with the tone and storyline of the novel. True, but it also enhances one's perspective on this great work. The movie is too kind to Mrs. Bennet but does articulate the truly desperate issue of marriage as the only career chance for young women. Donald Sutherland is a little underplayed especially in not showing his contempt for his wife but brings out so well his love for Lizzie. This is also the best portrayal of Jane I know of.<br /><br />And so on. Yes, this is not the literal adaptation of P&P but it really is a superb accompaniment to and enhancement of it. Jsne Austen was in no way a romantic but a shrewd and cool observer. She is Mozartian in that the cool and controlled surface is moving in that the depth of feeling their work hides but dignifies is so intense. Only in her last and apparently semi-autbiographical novel, Persuasion, does one get a sense of the depth of her regrets and the pathos of her short life. I think that the main contribution of the Keira/Matthew combination is to bring P&P closer to Persuasion and unpeel Austen's deep insights into and regrets about love in an age where feelings were so rarely expressed.<br /><br />This is a lovely and loving film. It is almost Chekovian in its style. I hope Knightley doesn't get nominated for an Oscar for her portrayal. It's far too good for that. I also hope she will pick scripts that help her grow beyond the Oscar-ready stuff.so rarely expressed. <br /> <br />This is a lovely and loving film. It is almost Chekovian in its style.

630460288X|5.0|If you are any kind of fan of Sylvester Stallone, you just have to get this movie into your collection!! He does his usual start to finish movie bang-up job of beating up on the bad guys, finding a love interest, and somehow \\"winning\\" in the end. Wesley Snipes just does a superb job portraying the \\"bad guy\\"!! He is a very ill-tempered killing machine with no regard to anyone's views. After being reprogrammed, while in cryostasus, he emerges as the ultimate killing machine wrecking havoc on a now peaceful society. So, now they have to go into the cryostasus prison and thaw out the ultimate cop. Yep, that cop is Stallone. As he gets re-educated on today's society practices, he must show the peaceful police officers of a new age and time, why he is the only police officer that may restore peace, while taking \\"Simon\\" (Snipes) down. It is a nonstop roller coaster of madness and mayhem as Sly finally gets his man and wins the tests of wills with Simon. Cool looking future world too.

B0007Y08IS|1.0|I guess it helps if one is a \\"South Park\\" fan.  I've never been.<br /><br />Still, I was ready to give this every chance in the world to make a comedic, satrical, sarcastic, perceptive socio-political take on our modern times, even with cheap production values, even cheaper looking puppets, and little if no imagination or funny jokes from the beginning 10-15 minutes.  As this film ain't no 4 hour deal, finding nothing remotely interesting, let alone humorous or clever in the first quarter or fifth, I was amazed how just plain unimaginative and boring this was.<br /><br />A film has to be really bad from the beginning for me to start fast forwarding within the first 20 minutes.  Usually by that time, I'm either willing to stick it out, or just give up.  This movie had neither quality.  By 20 minutes, my mind had thought of a hundred or so better uses of my time than this.  I skipped ahead only to find that to the end, there was no real brain food here.<br /><br />While South Park has (deservedly so or not) a reputation for taking real chances, why I asked, was this all so lame?  Was it just the crap visuals, the various flat jokes, or something much deeper?  For while neo-libs have embraced South Park the TV series for its innovations and anti-establishment ramblings, while this movie seems a big screen attempt at the same, the corporate influence and underlying neo-con truth of the South Park folks takes over.  A quick buck.  Capitalism at its worst.  In movie form.  Yee-hah.  Blah...<br /><br />What's most disturbing is that while this is supposedly supposed to be an indictment of sorts of blind patriotic American zeal and over-indulgence and arrogance, it ends up strangely justifying that very premise, and promoting it.  And while there is an overall criticism of recent US foreign policy, the \\"bad guys\\" still end up the same old \\"bad guys\\" as official US corporate media has sold us all along.  This makes the whole exercise lack not only sarcasm and satire, but right-on humor as well.<br /><br />I had looked forward to seeing this, even though I hate South Park.  I had hoped that those folks would really let loose here, and the shame is that most people who'll end up liking this, will like it only for its South Park connections, but not for what the movie really is, or is all about.<br /><br />A lot I'd bet will even take the final messages this delivers as somehow validating their faith in their seemingly leftist ideals.  The disappointing thing is that it does the exact opposite.  The creators of this obviously do not understand exactly what they're trying to present except to try to cash in on South Park trendy anti-establishment underpinnings.  Then again, I never thought South Park the series did (or does) that either.<br /><br />The only decent thing about this bore-fest is a few slightly humorous self-referential PUPPET jokes.  Otherwise, it is not visually compelling or innovative, most of the humor and the social and political elements tend towards the far right view of modern day reality, and one mostly fast-forwarded viewing of this was enough for me to dismiss this as nothing more than a wasted use of some seemingly real talent here and there.<br /><br />Again, as in most bad movies, the problem here is the writing.  I guess if you can get through the first 20 minutes or so without your mind wandering, you might get through the rest, then put watching this over again off for another decade.  I can't imagine any but a die hard and rich DVD collector actually wanting to own this.  It's basically just plain boring, what else can I say?<br /><br />I wonder if the puppet presentation was cheaper than a decent animated and CGI rendering, and if so, there's another problem. This is cheap schlock which doesn't even seem to understand or comprehend its own preachings, and done seemingly on a shoestring budget.  This film never goes far enough, never.  It was evident in the first 15-20 minutes, and the disappointment throughout only reinforces that.<br /><br />I wouldn't buy this at any price.  I wouldn't even want it free.  It's bad and boring from beginning to end.  There may be a short 10-15 South Park film here.  Stretched out to feature length, it is a way overlong and unenlightening, unfunny waste of time.isappointment throughout only reinforces that. <br /> <br />I wouldn't buy this at any price.
