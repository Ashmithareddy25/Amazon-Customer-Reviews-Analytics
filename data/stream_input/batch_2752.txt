B008EKMB82|5.0|This novel is wholly original, yet it also reminded me of two of my favorite books in the recent past -- Haruki Murakami's \\"1Q84\\" and David Mitchell's \\"Cloud Atlas\\".<br /><br />\\"1Q84\\" and \\"A Tale for the Time Being\\" both examine the realm of the other -- alternate realities, quantum theories, lives that are opposite but yet the same.<br /><br />Two quotes from \\"Cloud Atlas\\" fit right in with Ozeki's lovely novel:<br /><br />\\"Our lives are not our own. We are bound to others, past and present, and by each crime and every kindness, we birth our future.\\"<br /><br />and<br /><br />\\"My life amounts to no more than one drop in a limitless ocean. Yet what is any ocean, but a multitude of drops?\\"<br /><br />Ozeki's novel stands with these other masterpieces, yet stands alone too. Together. Apart. It is the same. (A statement you can surely appreciate if you have read this novel.)<br /><br />Nao is a charming, heartwarming, & heartbreaking narrator. Not since Lisbeth Salander (\\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\") have I so enjoyed a character. Nao is so real, so fresh, someone I wish I knew. Jiko is yet another fabulous woman in this novel, another person I wish I could know. Ruth is more stand-offish, yet she's integral to the story, to the raveling & unraveling of the pacing, the time, the tempo of the story....<br /><br />With deceptively understated simplicity (it's really just a teen girl's diary we're reading, after all), Ozeki manages to gift you, the reader, with a mind-expanding array of topics, ranging from love, home, bullying, suicide, war, the recent Japanese tsunami, to Zen, quantum physics, and the shifting realities between author & reader. This novel will break your heart & will make it grow too (along with your mind).<br /><br />Highly recommended.

B00BRUQ7ZY|2.0|Reza Aslan's new book Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth has been stirring a lot of controversy, most of it hot air, in recent days. Since I think it is important for me, as a future teacher of New Testament studies, to know what students will be walking in the door having picked up from popular media, I decided to read the book for myself. I started out thinking it was basically okay, tendentious and simplistic but basically repeating things that had been argued by at least one New Testament scholar or another. By the end, though, I revised my opinion: this is an extremely bad book, that in no way justifies its author's claims to have done serious research into the subject of the historical Jesus. It is misleading in almost very way and pathetically sloppy in its historical method.The book is roughly divided into three parts. The first part deals with the &#34;background&#34; of the sociopolitical situation in Palestine at the time of Jesus. The second is about fitting Jesus himself into that context. And the third is about the development of the &#34;early church&#34; after Jesus's death. Roughly speaking, the further along one gets in the book, the worse it gets and the more ridiculous the argument becomes.<br /><br />In short summary, Aslan's thesis is that Jesus was a militant revolutionary who may or many not have advocated violence againt the Roman Empire and its Jewish collaborators in Palestine (Aslan is rather unclear on what he thinks of this point.) According to Aslan, Jesus's mission was essentially about preparing the people of Galilee and Judea as a sort of secret army preparing for the day when God woud lead the people in a divinely sanctioned war to cleanse the land, in the manner of Joshua annihilating the peoples of the land. Jesus's selection of twelve disciples as his close companions is interpreted as his selecting war leaders for the reconstituted twelve tribes to lead the people in battle. And the episode traditionally called the&#34;cleansing of the temple&#34; is reimagined as Jesus descending with a horde-like armed rabble on the temple to disrupt all operations.<br /><br />Throughout his exposition of this thesis, Aslan displays the worst historical methodology I have ever seen outside of a Dan Brown novel. He claims at the book's opening that he will rely on the earliest and thus supposedly most reliable sources, Mark and Q, for his picture of Jesus. But throughout the book, this declared methodological stance is thrown to the wind as texts from all four Gospels as well as Acts are hastily pushed together like pieces from a dozen different jigsaw puzzles. Aslan relies on the method of historical &#34;proof-texting,&#34; drawing together little bits from the Jesus traditions to make his case.<br /><br />His attitude towards the reliability of the Gospels is a case in point. He is devastatingly critical when dismissing stories and sayings he considers unhistorical. But at the same time, he is gullible to the point of astonishment on other parts of the gospels. For example, despite self-exculpating caveats, he freely accepts the charges supposedly made against Jesus by the Sanhedrin in the passion narratives to be historically accurate, because he needs Jesus to publicly proclaim himself King of the Jews before the established authorities for his thesis to work. The calling of the first disciples as it is depicted in Mark and Matthew is also accepted without comments. So is the Transfiguration. The saying found only in Luke where Jesus tells his disciples to bring two swords to the garden of Gethsemane is also accepted, because it provides grist for the mill of Aslan's argument that Jesus was a violent revolutionary. And the stories of the empty tomb, despite their manifold differences and problems, are held to contain historical truth because so many early Christian martyrs supposedly went to their deaths for them! (This is a virtual mirror of an argument made by conservative Christianapologists, curiously enough-- they died for it, therefore it must have been true!)<br /><br />The naive methodology is supplemented with bad exegesis of numerous gospel passages, as well as a delightfully inventive imagination which fills in the blanks in the New Testament. For example, we are told that when Jesus went out into the wilderness following his baptism, he was not a lone solitary tempted by the devil, but rather a zealot-in-training hanging out with John the Baptist and his followers, learning the ropes, so to speak, of being a militant revolutionary. By far the funniest example of this phenomeon, though, is the author's imagining of a complete life story for Stephen, the famous martyr of Acts, including speculation about how Stephen got involved in the Jesus movement, capped off with the derisive claim that it was the fact that Stephen was a &#34;Hellenistic&#34; Jew that led him to fall hook, line, and sinker for all this rising-from-the-dead-Messiah business.My point is not that all of the things listed about which Aslan takes are historical are not so. Rather, it is that his supposedly &#34;critical&#34; attitude towards the sources seems to extend only to the parts of the gospels which would threaten his thesis.<br /><br />By far the worst part of the book is Part III, about the early church. Indeed, it is so full of complete lunacy that it is difficult for anyone with even the slightest familiarity with the field of early Christian studies to get through. But it is vital to Aslan's argument. Why? Because any thesis which posits such a novel thesis about the historical Jesus needs to explain the obvious elephant in the room: namely, why the Christian churches wound up preaching something completely different.Aslan's answer not new to him, and indeed it is virtually predictable at this stage: basically, it's Paul's fault. Aslan revives the classic divide posited by F.C. Baur in the nineteenth century, that early Christianity was a struggle between &#34;Jewish&#34; Christianity  represented by the Jerusalem apostles and Jesus's brother James, and the &#34;Hellenistic&#34; Christianity represented by Paul. Of course, according to Aslan, the latter won the day. Paul is depicted as preaching a &#34;diaspora Judaism&#34; that was totally divorced from its heritage, having become corrupted by Greek philosopy and mysticism. Aslan does deign to mention that many scholars take a vastly different view, bu they are dismissed with a rhetorical wave of the hand. In the book's brief bibliographical notes Aslan cites with approval the fringe works of Gerd Luedemann. Regardless of what one thinks of the relationship of Paul's message to that of Jesus, the old divide of &#34;Hellenistic&#34; versus &#34;Palestinian&#34; Judaism posited by Baur and endorsed by Aslan has been discredited in serious New Testament scholarship for decades. (See, i.e., the introduction to Hellenistic Judaism by John J. Collins, Between Athens and Jerusalem.) Considering that Aslan's other endorsements in the notes for the chapter on Paul are for the early twentieth century works by Rudolf Bultmann and Adolf von Harnack, we should not expect him to have much grasp of this development in scholarly opinion.<br /><br />Interestingly, the bibliograpical notes at the back of the book display at least enough familarity with NT scholarship to cite mostly reputable and recent sources. Perhaps the most astonishing thing about this book is how someone could (claim to) have read so much recent scholarly literature on Jesus and yet manage to get almost everything about Jesus and early Christianity completely, utterly wrong.In summary: don't waste your time with this book. Especially, avoid it if you are in any way a scholar of early Christianity. It may be good for a laugh at first as you snicker over the author's particularly egregious errors. But the humor fades when you realize that large swaths of the reading public who have recently catapulted the book to the top of the bestseller lists will actually believe that this pseudohistory is true.

B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I read this book after my husband and I heard the author, Reza Aslan, a noted academic, interviewed on NPR.  Aslan is a historian as well as a professor of religion.  His account of the life of Jesus of Nazareth -- i.e., Jesus before Christianity -- includes a fascinating, detailed political, economic, religious and social history of first-century Palestine.  Aslan also describes the split among early followers of Jesus, with one side represented by Jesus's brother, James, who led the Jerusalem faction, and other by Paul, the Apostle, who sought to spread the doctrines of Jesus beyond the Jews.  Jesus and his early followers, Aslan convincingly argues, were Jews, and their aim was, not to begin a new religion with Jesus as the central figure, but rather to reform what they viewed as the corruptions of the high priests, who had been collaborating with the Roman occupiers at the expense of the poor.<br /><br />Aslan's account ends with more than 100 pages of notes in which Aslan describes the evidence supporting his theory, as well as counter-evidence and counter-theories.  That such disputes exist is typical of academic research, particularly in those disciplines in which evidence is often scanty or, at best, incomplete.  Nonetheless, Aslan makes a compelling case for his theory that Jesus was what the Romans viewed as a subversive political radical, and that it was for this crime -- challenging the authority of Rome -- that he was crucified.  Aslan is also a good writer;  I thoroughly enjoyed his book, even though I am not a scholar in his field.<br /><br />As for the one-stars -- sigh -- should J.K. Rowling not have written about wizards, because she isn't one?  The anti-Islam rhetoric, both here and on Fox TV (my husband remarked that Aslan's was the most embarrassing interview -- to the interviewer -- that he'd ever watched), betrays not merely the reviewers' prejudices, but also their ignorance.  Academics train for many years in their fields.  I have a Ph.D. inEnglish and am American.  I teach British and (in translation) French literature.  I am Catholic; I teach Buber (Jewish), Nietzsche (criticized Christianity as a religion that celebrated weakness) and Foucault (who knows?).  It is incredibly sad, not merely that people misunderstand Islam, but that they have no idea how academic research is done or why academics may disagree.<br /><br />Five stars -- a good book for all.

B009LMTDL0|4.0|I finally read Sheryl Sandberg's book \\"Lean In.\\" I am still trying to decide how I feel about it. I am fully in support of equal treatment for women in the workforce. But I have never felt held back, discriminated against or intimidated by my gender in my business environment. So, I have trouble understanding that this is a real and continual problem in current business environments.<br /><br />Maybe I have been lucky. Maybe it is because I have a poor work/life balance with the work side a bit heavier, by my own choice. Maybe it is because I don't have children. Maybe it is because my boss is a woman.<br /><br />I agree with all the principles that Sandberg outlined and described in detail in the book. I just believe they should be followed and applied to all people that want to work, both men and women. Which I guess is her ultimate point.<br /><br />I've read most of Sandberg's articles and watched her TED talk and commencement addresses, so I felt like most of the book was a compilation of those articles and talks with content that I was already familiar with, so the book did not provide me with any new insight. However, if you are not familiar with her talks and writing, it is worth the read for both men and women about drive and ambition in business.

Set in the pre-revolutionary British colony of New York, and timed during the French and Indian war fought, this story is compelling.<br /><br />Though not appropriate for young children, the savage fighting evidenced during this war served as a potent backdrop to Mel Gibson's &#34;Patriot.&#34;  The story is one of romance, war, King, country, honor, trust and of course, love.  A remarkable tale -- riveting to the very end.

B00B7FXYJG|5.0|If you didn't know, The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 are based on a Graphic Novel by Frank Miller written in the 1980s. The graphic novel changed comic book audiences from that time on. No longer were they for kids and teens - this was written for those same kids who have grown up. (I even believe it was instrumental in paving the way for Tim Burton's movies) Anyway, these animated movies follow the Graphic Novel exactly! At one point I had the graphic novel out while the movie was going and even the backgrounds are right out of the book. Besides seeing the frames animated, the only other addition to the novel was the music soundtrack which I was impressed with. However, I must note that you don't really have to read the graphic novel to enjoy the movie. It stands out all on its own.

0792839730|5.0|I remember this when I was a kid...I read it when I was in high school.<br /><br />Dame Daphne Du Maurier, the widow of Lt.-General Browning, complained that her husband had been &#34;made the fall guy&#34; for the failure of &#34;Operation Market Garden&#34; by this film. Browning and the unseen Field Marshal Montgomery, who are shown as responsible for the failure, had both died by the time the film opened in 1977 (unlike the other commanders involved).<br /><br />A familiar story element in the World War II genre war film is the blowing-up of a bridge. This is especially common in films with the word &#34;bridge&#34; in the title such as The Bridge at Remagen and The Bridge on the River Kwai. Ironically, this film A Bridge Too Far which features a quite a number of bridges in it, only the Son bridge is depicted as destroyed. Just as Col. Stout ('Elliot Gould') approaches the crossing, the bridge is blown up by German artillery (but the actual blowing-up of the bridge is not seen in the movie). The Germans also attempt to blow up the Waal Bridge at Nijmegen, but are unsuccessful when demolition charges fail to explode. In the case of this film, &#34;A Bridge Too Far&#34; refers to the over-ambitions of the Allied strategy in Operation Market Garden. In order for the campaign to be successful, the Allies needed to secure several enemy bridges in a very short period of time. They were tragically unsuccessful.

B000M4RG42|5.0|In two and a half hours Clint Eastwood paints a thought provoking piece on heroism and war-propaganda. The film tells three stories: first it is the WW II battle of Iwo Jima where thousands of soldiers (Japanese and American) died 'conquering' that island. In the style of Saving Private Ryan (Spielberg is a producer of Flags) the viewer gets a astounding look at war with a lot of blood, guts and CGI. Second is the story of a son of one of the flag raisers on that island, who interviews other survivors of that battle to understand his dad a little better. This is very moving stuff, but stands a little pale in comparison to the final storyline. This is where veteran-director Eastwood really shines. Like his meditation on violence Unforgiven, Flags takes a closer look at heroism where soldiers by chance get into the spotlight of the war-propaganda-machine. Some may say that Eastwood made an anti-war film or even an anti-America film, but they're wrong. Flags is very critical on the way war is sold to the public. There's nothing honorable about killing or to be killed on the battlefield. The only thing that matters is that you protect you're friends in your platoon and that they protect you. Flags is one of the best war movies I ever saw, maybe even better than Ryan, because it's never sentimental and always honest in its portrayal of the soldiers and war in general.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|This is one of the best free apps of the day in a long time, Amazon! Thank you so very much! After the travesty that was yesterday's game, this is a breath of fresh air. I am truly enjoying it.<br /><br />The game works by using your procedural cognitive abilities to design the ball that the box requires, including colors and patterns. To do that, you have to figure out the steps in proper order or else you will create the wrong ball. I've never seen a game quite like this before and I think this is a genius idea. Its fresh, it's fun, and I'm really enjoying it.<br /><br />I love games that get progressively more difficult and that never treat you like you're stupid.<br /><br />In fact, I'm going to wait until tomorrow until it's not free anymore and I'm going to actually purchase it again for my wife on her account because I know she will enjoy it, too.<br /><br />5 stars and many more cheers!

The caustic media, the politicians who wish to micro manage the war, and the others who have no guts to stand for these individuals that they send to war.

B008L5G4I8|5.0|Viola! A good mystery! Keeps you on reading. I love Agatha Christie's books. And keep the price down as this are older editions.
0393338398|5.0|Michael Lewis is right there with Malcolm Gladwell in terms of his ability to tell a compelling story based on inarguably dry subject matter. My favorite thing about Moneyball is how easily its themes can be applied to subjects well outside of the world of sports.

B009XIXVU6|4.0|Again Hosseini educates us about the Afghanistan we never see on the news. He creates memorable characters and vivid descriptions. The plot here is sprawling -- perhaps too broad in scope of geography and time to keep us as enthralled as his two earlier novels.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I had trouble watching no more than two episodes a day.  Housework got in the way!!  However, there were times when I really didn't see some of the twists and turns that take place in this family.  I obviously loved the third season and wish it had been at least 12 episodes instead of only 9.  I truly recommend this season.
1427201439|5.0|I'm usually pretty finicky about audio books and who's reading them, mainly because when they're good, they're really good. (Jon Krakauer's Into Thin Air is a classic example of the good.)<br /><br />This reading of Dune is quite enjoyable. The narrator is quite good and keeps the pace moving. Many scenes are actually performed by several actors, and that's done quite smoothly, so it's not a jarring transition going from a fully narrated scene to one that's performed. My only complaint is that the actors often sound nothing like the voicing the narrator gives it. The difference is probably the most profound with Baron Harkonnen.<br /><br />Otherwise, this is a great listen. And unabridged, which is essential for a classic novel like Dune.<br /><br />The book itself is epic. There's plenty out there to read if you want to learn more about the book. If you saw the David Lynch movie version (ugh) or the miniseries (meh), all I can say is that you have been presented something nothing like the book. The book is more exciting, richer, with more nuanced and fascinating characters, and an epic sweep far greater than the cheesy effects on screen. Read the book.<br /><br />And if you don't have time to read the book, listen to this audio book on your commute, your summer vacation, or days off. It's good stuf!
B008MWBY6W|5.0|I was going to Africa, and needed something smaller than my camera back- pack  (Kata KT D-3N1) to use daily in Safari trucks. - This was a perfect choice. - I was able to fit my Nikon D5100 with nikon 18 to 300mm lens into it (just fitted - that's a 77mm diameter about a 4.5&#34; long lens) on top of that I also carried a spare battery, lens pen, cleaning fluid, a filter and couple of other bits in it.<br />Best part was a fluke, once I packed the camera into this back, it would still just slide into my camera backpack for the flights.<br />Great product, especially for the price!

Some interesting variations on many fantasies, such as &#34;spren&#34; for fellings and moods - (small creatures (I guess like some sort of fairy) that are attracted to strong emotions.<br />bought kindle version, downloaded very quickly via wi-fi.
B004UID2LC|4.0|It's alot easier to download videos onto my Kindle Fire.  The one thing I don't like is that it lists all the videos together.  I haven't been able to figure out if there's a way to group certain videos together.  For now, though, it works for my purposes.  I'd highly recommend it!

B008Y6R2UI|3.0|...get the book instead.<br /><br />The movie is just ok, it reminds me of some of the 'Christian' movies that are produced to push that particular faith.  When in reality, the production value isn't there to really push anything.  The movie felt 'cheap' to me, and thus only warrants a rating of 3 stars.  Had I not read the book, which I found excellent on many levels, I'm quite confident my review of this movie would still stand at 3 stars.

0740797719|5.0|This is an informative book.  I read it by jumping around and it is clear enough to support that.  I am sure others go cover to cover.  His concepts are complex enough to be meaningful but still straightforward enough to be understandable.
B004EPYZSU|5.0|When this movie was first announced, a lot of people were expecting it to flop because of its title, because, well, it does seem dumb at first. But honestly, how better to name a movie based on its plot? But, happily, there is so much more to Cowboys & Aliens than just aliens battling Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig. When a man wakes up with no memory of who he is or why he's in the small town of Absolution, with a strange metal bracelet on his wrist, he seeks out answers, only to be arrested for being the famous criminal Jake Lonergan. But, when he meets a mysterious woman (Olivia Wilde), things pick up speed. Col. William Dolarhyde shows up to collect Lonergan, only to be attacked by aliens, along with the rest of the town. Then, they must team together to find out what these beings want, and why some of the citizens were captured.<br /><br />Directed by Jon Favreau, who brought us Iron Man, Cowboys & Aliens is an adaptation of the Platinum Comics story of the same name. Some might go into it thinking they're gonna see a mindless, action-packed thrill ride, but it actually is more character-driven and complex than that. Harrison Ford's Dolarhyde is easily his best character since Deckard from Blade Runner (after Indiana Jones and Han Solo). A man scarred by battle and death, he does what he can to keep his reputation up, and his son out of trouble, who is captured by the creatures. Daniel Craig's Lonergan is partly the classic Western hero, bearing resemblance to Eastwood's \\"Man with No Name,\\" but also more modern characters too. Olivia Wilde's character, Ella, is really good too, there being more to her than meets the eye. When the movie first starts, it doesn't feel like a Western/Sci-fi hybrid, but a straight-up Western for the first ten minutes. Jon's directing here definitely shows his skill, and improvement into being a great Hollywood director. The script, with five writers attached, was actually very impressive. While the third act had some of the standardfight and battle scenes any action/sci-fi blockbuster usually comes with, it does feel more satisfying than most, as the conflict is resolved without any Deus Ex Machina scenarios or clichés. Plus, the characters (as said before) are very well-written, and very likable. There are, of course, some cheesy parts and goofy moments, but what damn good blockbuster doesn't have them? The visual effects were incredible, and I have no clue why they weren't given the Oscar nomination (Hugo was nothing compared to this, even if it was a good movie). The cinematography was great, as well, showing off the Old West in a very big way, paying homage to the older westerns. Then, the musical score by Harry Gregson-Williams was just spectacular. It has both Western elements and great emotional investment, bringing heart and soul into the violent chaos.<br /><br />In the end, Cowboys & Aliens is not for everyone, but is a well-made movie that must be seen by sci-fi, action and western fans. Even the comedy here is well-written. It's sad that this was a flop, because, if it wasn't for the stupidity of \\"judging a book by its cover,\\" we might have gotten a sequel because, how the movie was given to us, it was possible.<br /><br />4.5/5 Stars

1250029465|5.0|A Street Cat Named Bob is really a fascinating story about two unlikely comrades, who, in their own way, save each other.  James Bowen, the Author, is a London street performer (a busker), who earns a living playing his guitar.  He's a recovering drug addict, who struggles to stay focused and clean.  Bob is a homeless Ginger Cat who James finds injured in his apartment building and takes to the vet.  James spends most of cash-on-hand to get antibiotics to treat Bob's wounds, and this act of kindness and sacrifice is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.  You'll come to care about them both very quickly and you'll really hope that everything turns out well for both of them.  James tells his story in very blunt terms, about dealing with addiction and trying to turn his life around.  I learned about their story from a friend from England, who told me about the book, since my wife and I adopt rescue cats.  I didn't wait for the U.S. publication, I bought the book in 2012 from Amazon.UK and loved the story.  Now that the book is on our shores, don't wait.  Go grab a copy!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|If you liked the X-Files you'll love Fringe as well. Conspiracies, mystery, far out science. Just started watching this series of the first time, never had time before. Amazon instant video is a great way to watch it whenever I want.

B00CM9JKQM|1.0|I bought this it's first week out and was very disappointed. It claims to harken back to the classic Queensryche sound. There's its first problem - Queensryche was intended to be a band that developed over time, was progressive and creative, challenging to the listener. To pinpoint one segemnt of the QR era and say that time and that time alone should be the only sound of the band going forward is antithetical to the whole idea of QR in the first place. Besides that, even as an effort to recreate that era, this record falls far, far short of anything the band did on records 1-6. These tracks wouldn't have even made it as bonus tracks on reissues of those albums. This album sounds like a poor man's QR cover band. There's little creativity to be found anywhere on it's short recording time. This is a band trying to guess what its audience wants to hear and then deliver it, like a cashier delivering up fries and hamburgers at Burger King. I would much rather listen to an artist following their muse and let them take me on an adventure. If fans were that good at writing albums, they would be artists.<br /><br />Geoff Tate was a major part of what made QR special. This new guy is a poor imitation. It would probably be less cringe inducing if he just sung in his own voice instead of trying to imitate a vocalist who is clearly out of his league. Maybe Tate has lost some of his vocal range over the years, but that's just part of life and the aging process. I would much rather still listen to Geoff Tate, diminished range or not, than a karaoke singer.<br /><br />I get that people don't like Tate because of some of his actions, but that should be seperate from the music. I think a lot of the 5 star reviews on here must be anti-Tate reviews and not true evaluations of the actual music. Have you 5 and 4 star reviewers even listened to the record? Oh well. To each his own. Still, I think that years from now after all the dust has settled regarding the acrimonous split in the band, people will look back at this record more dispassionatley and realize it's not a very good album. If this were released back in the day when bands like QR ruled MTV and the radio and had big chart success, it would have been lost in the pack. There is nothing remarkable or unique about this record.

B00AZNEW5G|5.0|I love this movie - it gives the story in regards to the Osama Bin Laden compound invasion.  It correlates very much to a book which was written by one of the Navy Seals involved in this invasion.
B00004U45G|5.0|My two favorite bands combined and it actually works!! This version of Out On The Tiles is super cool. Listen to it CRANKED!!!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|A Memory Of Light presents The Last Battle and it is every bit as harrowing and brutal as you expect. Everything gets wrapped up. Battles are epic. Heroes rise and fall. Good battles Evil, Light battles Dark. Rand faces The Dark One. Trust me, if you have read through the series, this is the ending you needed. It's worth it. I can hardly believe the series is over. A Memory Of Light lives up to the expectations. Read it.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Bought one of these straight from Google the day it was released and have been able to test it out extensively. This is by far one of the coolest gadgets for streaming that I've ever used, mainly due to how simple it is to setup. From the minute you stick it into your TV to it being ready to use, is maybe a minute and then you are ready to stream.<br /><br />Netflix streams extremely well, simply hit the Chromecast button and select your Chromecast and it begins playing on your television. Now what is cool about this is the ability to still use your device for other things and to be able to use it as a remote. It also does not kill your battery doing this, due to servers doing the work.<br /><br />Google Music also streamed very well and I was able to adjust my queue and only pick up my phone when I needed to pause the music or change the song.<br /><br />I've also done some testing using a laptop and the Chrome browser. Pushing YouTube videos works very well, but broadcasting a tab from your browser is a bit jumpy and not as smooth as it could be. I also pushed audio from Spotify and that worked perfect.<br /><br />One other thing I tested out was copy the link to a movie on my hard drive and pasting it into the Chrome browser. After making selecting the Chromecast and making the video full size it began playing on my TV. I would not say the quality is as good as the Apple TV, but it looked pretty good and the audio was great. A feature like this would be great while traveling and not having to take your Apple TV on the road with you.<br /><br />Overall, I'm impressed with this little gadget and the potential it has if more companies like HBO, Spotify, and Amazon add this to their apps. However, the jumpyness of the streaming of a chrome tab has a lot to be desired, but I'm sure will get better over time.<br /><br />Lastly, if you have a Motorola branded phone, expect to have issues with Chromecasting. I have a Bionic and YouTube works, but Chromecasting does not work in any other apps. However, my Nexus and my wife's Samsung phone have no issues. I've read online that several Motorola phones are experiencing issues with this.<br /><br />For the cost I would say go ahead and buy it, but expect it to take awhile to catch on with other companies.ork in any other apps.

B004HO6HWA|5.0|I love Jason and this movie is more than what I was expecting. I was drawn in almost immediately and Ben Foster helped keep my attention until the very end.
0143034901|5.0|I got this book for a school assignment, but I really enjoyed it. The characters are so deep and there are so many parallels between them all. The story is so intriguing, with many layers and some metafiction. There is young love, old mysteries, death, innocence, and secrecy. It was fun to take notes and try to figure out what really happened and what would happen as I went along. Also, the setting of Barcelona is beautifully described. This book is of another world, another time and place. The city recovering from war, and the characters recovering from all that has changed in the city and their own seperate yet intertwined lives! It all seems to fit together. And for a translation, the words are beautifully chosen. Props to the translator.

B003Y5H5HY|5.0|I'm already a big David Fincher fan with both Fight Club and Se7en in my top ten list. As soon as I saw the gripping, unique, in-your-face trailer for \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" in theaters (and then repeatedly, over and over again, on YouTube), I knew that I had to see his latest entry. I had not yet read the book and had a mild interest in reading it, especially after a glowing review from my main man, Stephen King, but after seeing this preview, I quickly got to work, eager to see how well David Fincher worked with the source material.<br /><br />I was not disappointed in the slightest. As with any other Fincher movie, we are treated to gorgeous and inventive cinematography, alternately blinding white in snowy locales or oppressively dark for interiors or night-time shots (with an expected lean toward the latter -- it is a Fincher flick, after all). We are also treated to yet another unique score spearheaded by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, perhaps one of the best pairings between a director and his composer(s) since Tim Burton began working with Danny Elfman. As hinted at in the trailer, the CGI-laden opening sequence is brilliant and sets the tone for the rest of the movie. It's evocative of the equally-innovative beginning of Fincher's earlier film, Fight Club, and marks the man as adept at creating memorable starts to his movies.<br /><br />Even better, I found this adaptation to be superior to both the novel and the original Swedish film adaptation. The well-done novel contained both a taut murder mystery that kept me guessing the whole time in addition to a heartbreaking portrait of a female dominated and abused by the male-centric system that lords over her entire life, but I felt that it could have used a second look-through by another editor. It deviated from the main storyline at times, either with way too much information about Blomkvist's journalistic endeavors or a few too many scenes of romantic entanglements between Blomkvist and the many females of the story, ultimately bogging down the narrative. The screenplay instead streamlines much of the excess of the book, leaving behind a tighter, more focused story.<br /><br />While the Swedish adaptation was a fine movie all its own, I found that it seemed way too rushed for my tastes, instead zipping along at a pace more suited to a typical thriller. Thanks to its two-and-a-half hour running time, Fincher's version has time to detail more of Lisbeth's everyday life and her interactions with Blomkvist, thus strengthening the core relationship that has stood as the most compelling element of the series. Noomi Rapace did a tremendous job as the first film version of Lisbeth, but she seemed older and more noticeably attractive than her depiction in the novel. Rooney Mara more closely fits my vision of Lisbeth -- in her twenties, often shabbily-dressed, and somewhat plain, appearing to match the ugliness that she frequently feels inside and more easily able to fly under the radar of casual observers. Daniel Craig is also a perfect choice for Blomkvist, wisely deviating from his stoic Bond demeanor. While he's certainly smooth with the ladies, he can prove here to be laughably unnerved after bullets have been shot in his direction, an excellent foil to Lisbeth's cool and measured response to danger.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray version of this movie make a perfect package -- I can't tell you how excited I was to discover the \\"pirated\\" regular DVD copy in addition to the Blu-Ray main feature and extras discs. All are packed with great behind-the-scenes featurettes, interviews, commentary tracks, and appealing menu screens. If you're haven't seen this movie yet, you'll likely enjoy it if you're either a fan of the book or the movies of David Fincher. If you have, you'll be doing yourself a favor by picking up this excellent Blu-Ray treatment. (And it's easy on the wallet!)
B005LLSNNE|5.0|I love this show! The characters are interesting and the plot keeps you on the edge of your seat. I find myself wishing I was in a MC!

B001DM1VXE|5.0|Pi covers interesting subject matter, but not as interesting as the character that it centers around. The protagonist narrates the story and is so dynamic and separated from normal society that he is what you keep watching for. Definitely enjoyable to see his behavior and perceptions.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|S-C-A-R-Y. Good book but I will not be reading it again. It is really scary and gave me nightmares. Just enough gore to be disturbing but the really terrifying aspect is that one is trapped and has nowhere to run, plus all one knows is gone.... If you are sensitive to horror I do not recommend this book - unless you want bad dreams or want to sleep.
B000JZ68GG|5.0|Barbarella is the so hilarious and visually stunning that makes up for the fact that it is complete garbage. Not only that, but it is surprisingly poetic. &#34;An angel does not make love; an angel IS love.&#34; What?? That was just so unexpectedly deep. You will love Barbarella for the characters, costumes, sets, and awkwardly hilarious dialogue.
B0015AARJI|5.0|The only difference between the PS2 controller and the PS3 is that the r2 and l2 stick out. Its a little strange at first but once you get used to it you might prefer it over the PS2.
B006RXSW5O|4.0|So the characters are interesting and memorable, at points it's funny, and the low-budget feel is kind of enjoyable. However, some audience groups won't be able to appreciate the crass material of the film. Still, try it out, you might like it!
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|What a waste of my time reading this. I thought I would give it a chance and it was an utter flop.
B0008ENHUI|5.0|I've stopped counting the times I've watched this movie! Every time I discover a new layer, a new message,  a new truth applicable to life. Without being bombarded by modern special affects, just pure truthful brilliant acting! Love the scene where Steve McQueen says to Dustin Hoffman 'it must have been the wrong wave'.. A must see, must have movie!
B007MDB71O|5.0|I recommend this movie to everyone. It was poorly advertised with a boring name and no merchandise. However I am big Taylor Kitsch from FNL. This movie was great in everyway. Great story, actors and special effects. It's a grand movie in every aspect and the 3-D quality is fantastic. And his sidekick woola is the best. I would love to have had a toy version of it and hope they add JC characters to the Disney Infinity game coming out next month. If they can add lone ranger characters they should have JC as well.
B00AN0KBJC|4.0|like it just as well as the first season, Like the new  places and new faces.  Can not wait to finish all the episodes
B00DHNBPA6|5.0|A very well done reboot with enough subtle changes to the original story to make this a slam dunk of a reboot. If the plan is to also reboot Army of Darkness i can't wait.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This was a very good book. Wished I would have read it first before watching the movie but still very good.
B005C8ENI0|4.0|My family enjoyed this movie.  We have always enjoyed a good matthew mcconaughey film and this one met or exceeded our expectations.
B00D2HTRVQ|5.0|Kids are always watching daddy fix things around the house and in the garage, since they're not allowed to touch the real tools, they pull up this app and &#34;fix things&#34; like daddy. They work on their repairs while hanging out with daddy.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|I like this game. Play a lot. Try to beat my friends. Real fun to play with my friends.  Yeah..
0345525558|5.0|Loved this book!!! Not many books make me feel something for the characters but this book had my heart from the start. Worth the read.
B00CA3C1N4|2.0|all I want is to play online.  game needs a microscope....  searches indefinitely for online servers.  great fun game otherwise.  FIX INTERNET PLEASE.  would happily have 4/5 if you could fix the internet option
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|This movie is super awesome. Enjoyed every part of this movie. Action is at its best. The hulk is super awesome.
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|want to see more, but i think this was a series that they wanted to charge for the 3rd year, a 1.99 and episode.<br />i pay enough for the year don't need to pay for episodes.<br />if that was not the case, they didn't have the later years available.<br />anyway, wish there was more. I REALLY LIKED IT
B003M6FGTE|5.0|I'm not a big TV watcher and never expected to like this show, but I got hooked pretty quickly. It's very witty, I get a good laugh. There is a nice mix of music, too, and it's nice to hear them do everything from pop to classic rock to show tunes.
B004HWYTP4|3.0|Excellent older actors at their best. Characters are smart, skilled and funny. Helen Mirren proves skills, again.  Wanted husband to see before we see sequel together.
B00D5YNQ5E|5.0|I'm no \\"pro-reviewer\\" or anything, btw. This review is for The Aeroplane Flies High<br />reissue 5LP vinyl set.<br /><br />Upon opening:<br />Great, simple packaging. Think MCIS vinyl box. No book...not a problem for me. I<br />think I get the point by now. Sleeves match CD set design. Inner-sleeve<br />inserts are nice, as per usual. They have lyrics, track listing and credits.<br />Overall set seems free of exterior defects. 10/10<br /><br />1979:<br />First impression is that I got a great copy. Everything sounds consistent and<br />alive! Definitely enjoying this. Only thing I noticed was \\"Ugly.\\" That song<br />inherently has some low bass frequencies going on. If you've ever cranked<br />that song in your car or on some crappy system, I'm sure you've noticed that it<br />gets a little too much to handle on the chorus. It didn't sound bad to me, I'm<br />just pointing out that it was noticeable, just like the original version. Still,<br />best I've heard that song! 10/10<br /><br />ZERO:<br />Knocked it outta the park. Plain and simple. Sounds effin' fantastic. No distortion<br />on Zero. PM is intact...bare in mind the production/levels of the original.<br />Everything is faithful . Best I've heard these songs! 10/10<br /><br />TONIGHT, TONIGHT:<br />Same as Zero- faithful/flawless copy. All the folk-ier songs are definitely a hit.<br />Makes my ears happy. 10/10<br /><br />THIRTY-THREE:<br />Here's where I get a little whiny. My copy is popping on TT. Just at the beginning.<br />I stopped and inspected. Looks to be a spot/scratch or smudge on the vinyl. Tried<br />cleaning it, but to no avail. Just this copy, I'm sure. That can happen. Not<br />a game changer...have it on MCIS. Bass is a little heavy on TT. Probably the same<br />as MCIS. In TAFH, I heard some ray-gun like sound I had never noticed before. :w00t:<br />My Blue Heaven seemed to sound more old-timey, which I loved. Definitely in the production<br />I think. Been awhile since I had listened/focused on that one again. Reminds me of<br />Christmas! (received TAFH box set for Xmas in '96) I'd say another 10/10 in theory,<br />but I give my copy a 7/10.<br /><br />BWBW:<br />Seems to be a great copy. Everything sounds<br />warm and vibrant. YAIGT, Clones - sound phenomenal...rocking me harder than usual! ANLT seems like it benefitted from the remaster. Cellos seem like they got a little extra umph- or I'm just noticing them more. Whadda great cover! May be my favorite on this one! DU sounds nice in all its synth-pop glory. Subtle nuances are poppn' out quite nicely. I think Dreaming has been mixed different, just like the CD set, no vinyl flaws detected. 10/10<br /><br />I know I rated it pretty highly, but I believe it to be totally worth it. With the exception of my \\"popping\\" on Thirty-Three, I find this to be a grand-slam. Again, I'm no reviewer or have any superhuman vinyl listening skills...hope this helps!
B005DD7H50|4.0|Made me wonder if there were a pill to take to realize my full potential, would I take it? Would it really be 'me'? Interesting concept to the film. Not generally a Cooper fan but did a respectable job here. And, of course, there's DeNiro.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great searching by book, chapter, verse.  Can organize books alphabetically or in traditional order.  Any translation you could want, can make notes, interact on website.  Love this app!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Over all a great mouse for the price, the customization is impressive between the easy to use interface and the included weight set. The buttons may take some getting used to and may feel like a downgrade from a more expensive mouse but I feel the price greatly counter acts this.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Technically works well. Alerts for bad weather, gives me nice layout and hour by hour forecast, never had a problem with it
B003O86FMW|5.0|I am not normally a fast reader but I couldn't put it down!! I saw the movie the Hunger Games and learned quickly that book 1 and 2 are much more detailed than the movie.
B009ZQJ1G4|3.0|A little too gory.  It was a very dark and slightly depressing movie, but an interesting premise for controlling a society ...very much like Orwell's 1984.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|This series has kept me wanting more!! Can't wait for the next book!! I would suggest this series to anyone who enjoyed 50 shades of grey!!!
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Intense and well done.  I liked the character portrayed and found the storyline interesting.  I would watch this again as well as watch future installments of this character.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|This is kind of a ripoff of team fortress but beside that it's a pretty good fps and large supplies of weapons and really fun
B0018BF1KY|5.0|As I write this, there are 18 reviews for this set. All 5 star. Mine makes 19.<br /><br />As another reviewer said, you can basically bundle any five Rory discs together and it would be a killer set. The only drawback I've come across with this set is the feeling of being overwhelmed, once you've listened to them all you have to decide which one you want to listen to again. You'll sit there with all five sleeves in front of you, one in each hand, looking at the other three, unable to make up your mind.<br /><br />And if you think these are good, try out his live albums.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Just hard enough to keep you interested. Great way to quietly pass time. Had no problems loading and running it on my kindle fire.
0345529057|5.0|Amazing book must read . if u watch the show and u read this book u will get hella lot more context in the books. must rea.d
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I LOVE ALL BOOKS BY RICK RIORDAN!!!! This book has some very intense parts, but also a lot of funny parts, that's why I love his books so much.
B00CWVFVUE|1.0|This movie was a real disapointment to me. I have read all of the books and loved them very much. The movie did not come close to the books. Wish it was done over.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|The book was great! I can't wait to read the second book! the book was  a page turner! Loved it
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I saw the movie first so once again, the book was better. The story is more interesting when reading it rather than hearing it as a musical.  Such a touching story!!!
B004GYY714|5.0|This is one of my favourite apps of all.you get to listen to radio wherever and can choose whatever kind you want. Also other topics you can choose from.  Also local police scanner I found out about too.  I would highly recommend this app for the price maybe it was even free.
1616550414|5.0|it came in perfect condition! i love it and im a huge zelda fan! its great i look at through it all the time
B00CHI5B7A|3.0|I really had to be bored to keep interested. Not a bad movie. It was just a rainy day one for me..
B00CWIMY3O|5.0|This series is one of the most amazing things i have ever watched. I highly recommend it for anyone. just amazing
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|I really liked this movie. Though you really need to be paying attention to EVERYTHING to keep up with what was going on. Very interesting though and keeps you on your toes
B0078X2LKY|5.0|a ton of cute fun. i loved it sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much. a really cute book. really cute.  did i forget to mention it was cute?
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|If your into witchcraft/SyFy movies this is a must see! It is a love story and rival family must see! You think you know what is going to happen and BAM! You just surprised! Starts off a little slow then escalades quickly!
B00D8OHPF8|5.0|I love this song and the vulnerability he expressed in the lyrics! Joe is sexy sexy and more sexy!!!!  This is a great r&b song sung by a great singer! After hearing this song i want the cd!
B00DM0XXCM|5.0|I rate this movie @ 5 stars because it was unique. Obviously a love story isn't unique but being from 2 different worlds and being humans in both and not aliens/syfy like creatures was really neat. Funny, unexpected and kept me on my toes! I loved the fact that in most movies one world ruining another usually causes chaos between the people on both sides but this one interconnected and was mind blowing with the technology difference between worlds. I recommend this movie to ANY love story lovers and/or SyFy lovers!
B000PXUA5W|5.0|The recipient of the gift absolutely loved it! Combo of 2 favorite interests--Legos & soccer! Plus grandma liked the educational time telling teacher feature! Changeable colors for band was also fun!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|its a  good book and i'm looking forward to getting the second and third book by suzanne collins. i will be ordering them soon.
B00004Z459|5.0|don't know how i could have missed this release ,but better late than never.all tracks are just excellent ,heavy but refined purpose ,just love it...
B002ZG97EC|5.0|It's a great all around movie, it's a fun movie for all ages and great for families to just relax and watch
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I love playing subway surfers but i don't like how when they have limited people they cost so much coins and I think that they should not cost alot because it's limited and alot of people want it. Another thing about limited people is that I think it should be limited for months not days because people work their butts off to collect the coins and try to get the person on time before it is gone. You should also reapeat the characters instead of making new ones but once in a while make new ones because I wouldn't want to repeat over and over again but to have the person and it getting repeated. Another thing is i think when u do the daily challenge or the missions they should get a person not work their own butts for it.i hope you learned from my paragraph thanks for reading it!<br /><br />Thanks again,<br />Maddie a subway surfers fan
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|From me this gets a total of five bananas! I love this game and I play all the time! To much fun for me and the little ones!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I like this app. I am color blind, but this app is addictive and keeps me busy. You should try it. It is fun.
B00BCG1MK8|4.0|Mr. Deutscher does the layman a great service in introducing us to some of the difficult ideas about the history of languages and their evolutionary development over the ages. He takes us far beyond the Grimm's law and explains highly technical notions in a way we can understand with a bit of effort. Much of the book is devoted to the question, &#34;If languages seem to be getting simpler and simpler over time, what caused them to become complex  to begin with?&#34; The answer appears to lie in the analogy with earth geology's erosion and sedimentation.<br /><br />The only thing I found lacking was a linkage to real world history, outside of the language context. That is, what was happening in the world while certain language developments were taking place. That must be the subject of another book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|But I love everything about it. It's don't work too good on my phone. But on my kindle fire I can't seen to put it down haha
B004LROUNG|3.0|This is not his best.  Grisham seems to write book that are incredibly entertaining and fun or some mediocre ones.  This is one of the mediocre ones.  I read it after someone recommended it but was somewhat disappointed.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|there was nothing wrong with this but it just was not for me.  not my kind of games, that's all!
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Without a doubt the best book that i read this year.  Very insightful, well written.  Duhigg is great.  I was so enthralled that first I  sent it to my friends and then i looked for other things that he may have written.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Very easy to use. Easy for these aging eyes to see.  Among my favorite time wasters.  Definitely worth having on my Kindle.
B000K7VHLY|5.0|This is a good movie because it is romeo and juliet with gun fights. It's a good story plus they kill each other with guns instead of swords. Good scenes.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|I had no prior knowledge of the subject of this novel.  It was at times difficult to read about the cruelty and lack of humanity of the North Koreans, however the characters kept me hoping and cheering for their survival
B003G4W49C|3.0|I read this book, because I like sci fi and it won an award. Went into it not realising it was a childrens book, although had to wonder, when there is a child on the cover and children are going to rescue the world.  If I was a child,  I probably would have loved it, but as an adult no.  It seemed light weight.  I couldn,t see the point of all the physical fights.  Why not simulators as there was never going to be hand to hand fighting.  But then that wouldn't have fitted in with the ganging up and deaths.  Details like that annoyed me.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It is pretty fun. I l ok me it a lot and I hope u will too. I I'm now I do so enjoy it and see you later
B00571F26Y|3.0|This book was one of the recommendations on Amazon that piqued my interest because I have a little belly.  Its an interesting theory that wheat maybe the cause and the arguments are compelling.  Particularly where the Doctors patients are miraculously cured, I don't think he mentioned one that isn't.  That is the books problem, it leans towards bias.  Further research and reviews of the book, reinforced this for me.  For example, one review talks of egyptian mummies (early wheat eaters) , as being unhealthy,  with tooth decay and stunted growth. Then I couldnt help thinking the Doctor, thinking himself on to a good thing as sales rapidly increased for his book, rushing out and producing a cook book.  Perhaps if he used some of the money he makes to scientifically prove his ideas, I would have more faith.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This is a must see movie weather you are 6 years old or 60. Funny, entertaining and minons are people too
B00DP3IGJ6|4.0|Plot was a little obvious about fifteen minutes in but it had a good pace and had a couple of little twists at the end.  I enjoyed it and it passed my litmus test that I didn't fall asleep half way through.
B009CF7JDU|5.0|I hadn't seen it seen I saw it years before, this time with my 12 year old son and he loved it, hopefully he didn't get any ideas!!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Very fun read! I LOLd on several occasions. Need twelve more turds for this review, I mean words. Nailed it.
B005723JSQ|4.0|A little slow to start but picks up. And pretty funny too. Anyone that texts a lot will like it a lot.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love how the game is and I love the theme parks its beautiful. I think that the people who did this game os very smart. People should play this game more often
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Too much similarity to a murder that recently occurred in NH, in which a college student was killed by an older man who wanted a  'slave'.  She paid a dear price. What would any bright young woman be thinking of to give up her total self for subjugation in sex.  Forget it.
B00A6J9SM6|5.0|Mr. Collie has put together what I hope is the first in a series of definitive books on PowerPivot, and self-service BI.<br /><br />Written in an easy to understand prose, Rob takes PowerPivot users to the next level with Microsoft's new product.<br /><br />Packed with tips, tricks, and 'traps' (to avoid) --- A Simple Guide... takes packs a tremendous amount of knowledge into a VERY QUICK read.

B008JFUPOY|5.0|\\"After what many people consider the great disappointments in Pixar's career, Cars 2 and Brave, the legendary animation team up-the-ante a little to bring back a beloved film, Monsters Inc., with its prequel Monsters University. In regard to how well the film does, it goes beyond expectations (as I did not read the synopsis or information about it) only to offer a very funny, unique, and occasionally tense film about what it means to show how scary and strong you are.<br /><br />The film has, in some way, a more human quality to this than I could imagine where Mike and Sully show their frustration, happiness, and excitement all around their first semester at MU and given the university setting, the film gives a very old-school and quirky vibe poking fun at fraternities, admissions, laboratories, study habits, parties, and casual cliches from films like Animal House and Revenge of the Nerds (but more family-friendly). The voice work and imagination, while not as dynamic as it could have been or its predecessor, amps up on providing some relatable and funny to many people within the 18-24 year old gap with smart jokes and satire and the children very strong animation, background design, and colour schemes with zany situations involving Mike and Sully's fraternity. Helen Mirren provides an intriguing voiceover as the menacing and straight-forward observer of the Scaring Programme. Her presence, even if a monster, makes you feel that you should not mess with an experienced person like herself.<br /><br />The film might trouble some parents as the film does not end in an expected way or promote the strongest morals but it certainly heightens its awareness when Mike and Sully know their actions and fallouts are a result of them being two polar opposites learning and driven to \\"scare.\\" For British and international audiences though, the humour maybe too specific and culturally irrelevant due to the Americanism/possible Canadianism of the jokes about fraternities, cheerleaders, and college football (or US rugby) will not be well-understood.<br /><br />But then again, the positives here outweigh the potential negatives. MU is certainly a feast for the eyes and it does not disappoint, bore, or make you exhausted. Out of all the Pixar films, MU might be ranked just below The Incredibles and Ratatouille and ranked above Toy Story 3 (no offense to any fans) and Finding Nemo which serves very good justice. Even with a Rotten Tomatoes 78%, the underdog still wins the round here and so does Brave to a certain extent.<br /><br />As a tradition of all Pixar films, there is a short film. The Blue Umbrella is their newest short film and it premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival in 2013. In short, the film is a simple and coincidental love story that focuses on a blue umbrella gazing at a red one and finding it. The animation is beyond superb as it executes an element of perfection and believability in the way it looks. If it is live-action or performance capture, then they have certainly done a good job at enhancing the realism here. It also feels a lot more experimental and possibly hipster than the other Pixar shorts as given by the score and the glitchy editing when something changes drastically in a scene. Nevertheless, it is certainly a well-dserved treat and shows how capable Pixar are at this craft much like their short films Geri's Game and Luxo, Jr.\\"ers, and college football (or US rugby) will not be well-understood.<br /><br />But then again, the positives here outweigh the potential negatives.

B0073LJ61S|5.0|The mighty Van Halen!!!  Great album and I listen to it often.  Cheers to the Van Halen Family and DLR.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I've only seen the first two episodes but find the characters well developed, but the plot unbelievable. The situations are interesting. Because the protagonist had to update his wardrobe for the job, I find I am much more aware of tie width now and can date some movies.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Was a great read. It made you feel their emotions , their hurts...I would definitely recommend this book. I will look for other books she has written.  Definitely 5 stars
1400064287|5.0|Many people have good ideas but they do not know how to present them in a way that gets people's attention.  Using the very techniques they commend, these authors will help you to be a more effective speaker and writer.  Guaranteed.
1594136440|5.0|This is by far one of the best novels I have read this year. It is hard to believe that this is Kathleen Grissom's first novel! She has given us great character development and insightful knowledge from the point of view of an indentured white child and her life among the black slaves who gather in the &#34;kitchen house.&#34; With lots of unexpected twists and turns, this is a wonderful story!
B002ZM74Y6|4.0|This movie is definitely NOT one to watch if you are in any way put off by depictions of violence, use of profanity, or stereotypical images of Italian-Americans. That said, the acting is first rate and the characterizations, while departing quite a bit from the the book on which the movie is based, are very well drawn and believable. Ray Liotta, who plays the lead role, narrates during most of the film, which at time seems a bit excessive; and there are a few stop-frame scenes which I found did not add the dimension of 'realism' which the director (Martin Scorsese ) obviously intended them to bring to the story. This is a &#34;long&#34; film (over 2 hours) and it should be given the period of time it covers (1950s thru early 1980).<br /><br />Paul Sorvino plays a very believable and convincing role as a low level mob boss and his dialog couch should be credited for helping him pull off a well toned &#34;Brooklyn&#34; accept and intonation. Robert De Niro is one of my favorite actors with an incredible range of talent (check out his other films: The Score, Wag the Dog, Casino - also starring Joe Pesci, Limitless, Ronin). Joe Pesci turns in a very decent job as a malevolent, trigger-happy, wiseguy; but he can't get out of the shadow De Niro and Liotta cast across the film.<br /><br />I must admit upfront that I have had a thing for Lorraine Bracco and her role as Liotta's wife while good, is regrettably not as strong as it could have been (especially when you read the book this movie is based on).  Her narration during the movie is counterpointed to Liotta's but it does not truly reflect the conflict and turmoil her character demonstrates in her acting.<br /><br />Surprising to most, Samuel Jackson makes a cameo appearance in what I believe is one of hist first roles in a major motion picture.
B007N8RULO|4.0|good except for the annoying ads. easy to figure out. I have always loved spider solitaire and this one met my standards.  would recommend.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The Chromecast (while not huge right now as far as developer support goes) is going to be HUGE!!!  For 35$ Google has figured out how to have people interface with their \\"smart\\" TV's.  Netflix is only the beginning people.  Next up will be Hulu Plus, Plex, and everything you could imagine being on your Tv's.... plus, for 35$, what is there to lose?  GO BUY ONE!!!!
0062215507|5.0|This product is really so great. It was so many amazing artifacts. My favorite is the Quiditich World Cup pamphlet.

0553801473|1.0|A Dance with Dragons has all the white knuckle, page turning, edge of your seat action one can only find in a geometry textbook. The fifth installment to the Fire and Ice series follows the story structure of it's predecessor: Create new characters nobody cares about and follow original characters as they wander aimlessly. It is said some people like the sound of their own voice. George R. R. Martin must love the sound of his pen. This book crosses the 1100 page mark with the reader asking if their is a point around page 400, realizing their isn't around page 800, and desperately praying for some form of joy while finishing this white whale of a book, simply because of the time they already invested in it. Speaking of which, I may contact my lawyer and see if I can sue the author for time lost. What a shame, considering how excellent the first two books in this series were, to see how it digressed into such useless piddle. The books \\"picks up\\" where the third one left off avoiding any sort of development among characters you care about. But don't worry, every time anyone enters a room with more than one person the author gives their name, house insignia, and lineage only to never mention them again. I truly feel this book could have been reduced by 500 pages if he would have used phrases such as, \\"he had 10 guards with him\\". Instead of describing the background of every person in all of Westeros holding a sword. I'm 100% convinced that if this book contained only the readable, interesting content that I was looking for, it would be reduced to 2 or 3 pages in length. I will not read the sixth book and if any of my children do they will be immediately written out of my will.
B0045XGRQE|5.0|I only watched the Iron Man series after watching the Avengers with my kids.  I really enjoyed the action movie and RDJ's great looks.  Great date movie.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|This is an interesting story well told and very thought provoking.  I'd recommend this book to anyone who is interested in reading about a very much not discussed topic - women prisoners in current day America, who they are, how they got there, and what being a prisoner really means.  Although this is non-fiction it reads like a novel.  You really want to know what happens to these people.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|RED is worth the price of admission at 7.99 or under. great action, top notch cast. MLP is soooo cute
B006S01GH2|5.0|I would recommend this movie to every movie lover. Light hearted, whimsical, funny even though the topic it talks about is very serious.
B003VXMMTK|3.0|It started out super interesting, and I thought it moved well throughout the first three.  I was pretty bummed with the last of the four and expected a better outcome.  I feel like I wasted my time.
0061733199|5.0|This book is great!!! It has how to tie knots with pictures, it has toxic plants/fungi, edible plants/fungi, how to read maps and clouds. This is almost complete, i would recommend supplementing it with your own photos and information. For example the pictures in the book of the various different clouds are of poor quality i will be printing my own with a little more info about each. If your a preper/survivalist then grab this boom!!
B004W1GCQO|2.0|I thought that it was pretty boring and would recommend Downton Abbey well before this one.  Yawned throughout the entire thing.
B00DP3IESY|3.0|Ok!  for a stay wake person! Fun to watch but no redeeming value.  Lot of good action, but story line is mediocre.
B000I9YLUI|5.0|I love this movie because of the time period and actors that played in this movie were spectacular.  Especially Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen ) is so.... handsome and distinquished gentlemen. I want my future husband to look and be this like him.
B003NX75B8|5.0|Hoping to read something contemporary that high schoolers might read, as my daughter is heading that direction, and hoping for some insights into how young people in a broken world get a grip this book provided a real kind of beauty that transcends the pain of growing up with a conscience.  I had to be brave to read this because I despise crude language.  I overcame my aversion and feel great about it!  This book is fabulous.  I read it and wept!  For ages 17 and up.
B0040I09RM|5.0|love jax !<br /> you have to keep watching never know where it will go next.  Very addictive ! not a bad addiction to get hooked on
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|This one has it all.  It has a great story, performances and music.  I watch it at least once a year.
B00CLF80O0|5.0|This band kicks complete ass. Top notch cats from head to toe! Tichy rocks hard. Fantastic setlist too!The guitar action between Reb Beach/Doug Aldrich goes unmatched.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Any book about Christianity written by a Muslim must be fiction. Who is Alsan to write about something he doesn't practice? Do historians write about the past in which they were not a participant in? Do astronomers publish papers about planets and solar stuff they haven't set foot on? Exactly. Aslan has the stones to call himself a historian. He's just insulting the hard working 'merican that doesn't have the time or the money fur one of them fancy degrees. Well, so what he has four degrees in religion? They were probably gifted to him as a member of Obama's secret Muslim cabal. These university elitists with their research, it's all an elitist conspiracy to destroy 'merica. Aslan probably knows some of the same researchers and scientists that are trying to shove the theory of global warming down 'merica's throat. It was 60 degrees outside yesterday during JULY. Take that scientists and Aslan. But since Jesus said turn the other cheek, I award five stars.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|You could not have picked a better cast of characters to pay tribute to Merle & Buck. This is a fantastic collection of AMAZING players. At the top of the list is the stellar guitar work and vocals of Vince Gill. Right there with him is one of the greatest steel guitar players of our time Paul Franklin. The combination of Willie Weeks/Greg Morrow is the best there is. You need to get this if you are a REAL fan of Country Music.
1781162646|5.0|As I usually enjoy Stephen Kings work I was not disappointed. It was like a good short story..I recommend it to anyone who just likes a good story.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Reacher is 199% legit. Best series in the world.  Action, humor, and a true hero all in one series. Read in any order or google chronological order, you won't be disappointed.
B0018CENUC|5.0|Excellant addition to my Kindle. I love Toby Keith songs, and I love this album. I definitely recommend it. :)
B0063M22QO|5.0|I enjoy this game.  I didn't know what this game was all about when I purchased it but I just purchased and just started playing and found out what I was missing.  I am still learning but love the game and it is great fun.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|It was great book with compelling stories of different characters that I couldn't put down. The author has a powerful way of storytelling and drag you across the world. Overall a very enjoyable book.
B00243FQFA|5.0|What can I say? You either like Stargate  stuff or you don't. This is the fifth and final season of SG Atlantis. In my opinion the show should have had a longer run and thus more time to wrap up several loose storylines. *sigh* But it is as always, my favorite actors besting the bad guys! Action abounds! Sit down, watch the show and just enjoy.
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|Excellent mixture of action and humor.  Exceeded expectations.  You asked me to post on this movie, then you require I write more?
B00D6SBOWG|4.0|The play is similar but the android version does not have the daily bonus games. Which is a feature I really like on my iphone. Maybe it will get updated. But its a very addicting solitaire game.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book and all Percy Jackson or the Hero's are some of the best books i have ever read. You  cannot go wrong here. The series and this book in particular combined action love loss and humor to make a suspense filled with pockets of laughter formula that is fantastic!!!!!! I LOVE this book.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|I saw this movie at a theater and was so touched with the care that was given to the deceased.  I could not find any stores here in Honolulu who has it.  I asked a friend if she saw the movie and she said it was one of the best movie that she had seen and I probably would have a better chance of obtaining the DVDs if I went on line.  We now have our own to keep with our other &#34;favorites.&#34;<br /><br />I was very pleased with the product.  Thank you.
B003B02O14|3.0|I will still give John Grisham top marks for his excellent writing skills, however I found this novel to be different from his usual style.  The Partner was complicated to read and get into;  there were many new characters introduced in the first few chapters, and I had to re-read many parts of this to get everyone straight in my mind as I progressed through the novel.  I had hoped the story would have had more suspense....I really liked The Testament by Grisham - also based out of Brazil - but this one, The Partner was not as good.
B00CWVBV4E|5.0|This movie includes a lot of characters from the DC universe and the vehicles are true to the kits that you can purchase.  So it appears that the movie was made with the toys that my son plays with.<br /><br />The characters have a real personality and the plot is a little bit meatier than one would expect from an animated movie with toys as the focus.<br /><br />The price was great compared to how often it's been watched on the Kindle or TV.  It more than payed for itself the first week after it was downloaded.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|The performances by Kevin Spacey & Robin Wright-Penn are stunning; as is the rest of the cast.  The story is about a very dark side of some of the key players in this &#34;fictionalized&#34; Washington D.C.  Their calculation and manipulation of  everyone around them is fascinating; while at the same time, disturbing.  Could some of these behaviors actually occur in today's politics?  . .  you be the judge, but it is well worth every penny to see this masterful drama!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I love the minions...and finally, an adult character that even the males in the house will love. It's adorable and everyone should see it at least once in their life.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|great movie, everyone should see it  We just loved it.  Try it -you will be sure to love it..Great  five stars
B00A9X9ORI|2.0|I was intrigued by the preview of this film more than the actual movie. It drags on and on and its just depressing.
B002VL2PTU|5.0|This is something for everybody to see!  You won't ever see anything like it again!  Michael Jackson is truly The King of Pop!  God rest his soul!
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Watched the season in 4 days -  could not wait for each episode- always enjoy the new characters and story development within a historical setting.
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|this game is just what I was looking for, a fun logic puzzle with a little math too :) Haven't needed to use the hints yet, but it's nice to know it's there.
B008TRH5N6|5.0|Good book like the scripture reference and science explanations giving balance to the subject. I recommend it to people who want to learn more about this fascinating topic.
B00AQNOCZ0|5.0|The discs contains everything, and the price is great too. it has several kinds of subtitles including Chinese etc. We like it very much!
B004GUSG4M|4.0|This book certainly held my interest. I would've liked to have read in one sitting but other priorities demanded my attention.  The characters were believable, though one person did turn out to be quite over the top in his madness.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love this game its time consuming and great for car rides (: its doesn't have ant glitches and always opens fast and easy (:<br />Love Love Love &lt;3
B000VMFDW2|5.0|I have been reading numerous military novels over the past few years, all of which come from different perspectives... E.B. Sledge's story was indeed the most eloquent, which is amazing because of his front line view. Esprit de Corps, wow!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|What a great series!  I watched all three seasons and wait with anticipation for Season 4! Great plot lines. Great acting.
B003ASLJK4|5.0|I loved this movie because of the good old fashion story line.  It actually reminded me of a dear friend who lived in similar conditions and she was just sort of stuck in her situation.  Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep did their excellent job of acting.  It's a Keeper!!  Phyllis A.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|Donna Noble is the best sidekick ever. Paired with David Tennant as the Doctor makes this is my favorite season by far- it's hilarious and entertaining. You won't regret watching it.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I love my new Plantronics Voyager Legend  ear piece and charge case.  The quality is great and I can hear with no problem.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I hate love stories, but this book was so well written and the characters were realistic and well developed.I felt like I was there in the story with them, rooting for them, feeling their pain and hope. I think Hoover may just be a new favorite author of mine.
B00422LESO|4.0|I love jane austen and I saw this book in target so I ordered it on my kindle I liked it I wish it was a little longer I will definitely see the movie when it comes out!
B0071WQ7WU|5.0|I LOVE this CD!!  I listen to it all the time!  It is by far my favorite Shinedown CD!  I definitely recommend it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is an amazing book that gets better chapter by chapter. I couldn't put it down after about halfway through. Ender is an amazing character, with a stunningly stellar supporting cast. Best book on the CMC's reading list.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book it had suspension and you were always wondering what was going to happen next. If you like suspense novels then this is the book to read.
B006RXSW5O|4.0|In a really low budget film (note the credits where they thank the owners of the two stores), that is hysterical and having you laugh everytime someone says &#34;37&#34;.<br /><br />The language is a bit too much, although it is probably not too far off of the mark in terms of vulgarity<br /><br />You have to watch a couple of times otherwise some of the more nuanced jokes will escape you
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is a great app!  I love that I can check different cities, not just my own! Used it to see the weather where my daughter and her family were on vacation.  Very accurate.
B007MDB71O|5.0|Those of us who were born just before \\"Star Wars\\" understand that George Lucas borrowed heavily from science fiction classics such as Dune and Edgar Rice Burroughs 'Princess of Mars' to create his worlds. As a kid, I loved every book in this series. I had a pre-teen crush on Dejah Thoris, imagined battling side by side with Tars Tarkas, and wished I could fly above the skies of Barsoom in my Martian flyer. This was a world that lived and breathed, it was rich in mythology and action. Could it ever be created on film?<br /><br />When I saw 'John Carter' my childhood fantasies finally came to life on screen. It's clear that Andrew Stanton really \\"got it\\". The production design of Barsoom was spot-on. Tars Tarkas, Woola, the White Apes were created as they came from the pages of Burrough's books. The martian flyers were just as I had imagined them: light, airy, spectacular. Lynn Collins as Dejah Thoris was gorgeous, strong and intelligent, good in a fight, and a solid foil to Taylor Kitsch as John Carter. Both parts very well cast, both characters we really cared about. A tribute to the director that the story remained very \\"human\\" throughout.<br /><br />My sons both loved this movie as well. We've watched it over and over again. It is an unappreciated masterwork from an incredibly talented Disney team. I purchased this for my Amazon Kindle and on Blu-Ray - both are excellent but the skies of Barsoom look best in Blu-Ray on a High-Def screen!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really like this. I like how it's not just avoiding obstacles. You get to fight Vector and he's like a boss.i like how, depending on which turn you take, you could be above ground in the streets or underground.
140006922X|5.0|haven't read the book, I might, not sure yet, but I felt the need to do my part and review it without having read it just like all the people rating it 1 star without having read it
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|Don't buy this if you're expecting a run-of-the-mill French House party album. The clean, professional disco-circa-1970's recordings on this are insanely catchy; every song is fun to listen to and it makes for an album that's really hard to put down. No two Daft Punk albums sound alike.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I just loved this story so much. It makes me want to go to Vegas. I thought it had a lot of humor and well written and I would love more of Megan and Connor.
B009GEAPYW|4.0|That's all you really need to know. Sometimes the dialogue lifted straight from the comics doesn't seem to translate well to film - sometimes it'll sound a little awkward - but it stays true to the seminal TDKR and deviates little from the source material.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was just amazing. The Hunger Games series is one of my favorite series. Go Katniss.(Now read the last book people!)
B009JVSAVM|5.0|%This is about 40 hours of non-stop laughter and great writing. And watching the episodes over again are just as funny.<br />I never watched the series when on TV and just started watching the reruns and am hooked. Hard to even choose a favorite character- they all compliment each other so well.
B008OOYALE|4.0|It takes a little while to get use to the game , but I love the slow pace. I like to see what you can create! I like it. I have to check on my dragons every day !
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|Its a great game that I actually had already from Google Play, since its the free app of the day today I re-downloaded it and played again... I forgot how puzzling it could get at times....I would suggest this game to anyone who enjoys a good puzzle and a novel way of solving puzzles.  Its definitely a fantastic app I think it has a 4.4/5 rating on Google Play with over 5K downloads.  Give it a go what's the worst that could happen
B009WO7NQO|5.0|BEING A STAR WARS FAN MAKES THIS GAME AN EASY CHOICE.  IT IS A FUN ADDITION TO THE ANGRY BIRDS SERIES.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|I love the HBO series. The books are verbose. This series are  probably the first books made into  tv that's better than the books.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Stupendous a very indicating game it's a fun game to play with family members and friends. You should get it.
B004JMY312|5.0|And old classic that just doesn't age! I would watch this when I am 90 and still love it! Boom
B000HL2J0G|5.0|While a bit dated, &#34;MacGyver&#34; is still entertaining. The cinematography is good but lacks some of the realism of more modern techniques. Never-the-less, it is still current enough to entertain. Chewing gum, duck tape, or paper clip are all better than guns.
B004MC8CA2|2.0|While the availability of Bible selections is remarkable the inability to retrieve account information made for confusing operations and I was unable to access my account to reset everything. I finally deleted the app from my phone and replaced it with another one. I only wanted to erase everything and start fresh but the app made it to confusing.
B000IZ4R1U|4.0|I just love Angelina Jolie movies...She is such a intense actor and skilled...The Movie was full of action and suspense...
B00E25RD68|3.0|I liked the surprise story twists and the merging of reality with imagination. A little to violent for me and though engaging, the premise was thin.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|I thought Oz was very good.  I enjoyed it from start to finish.  The acting was strong and the cinematography beautifully done.  The special effects were also quite well done.  I recommend this film for people of all ages.
0385344228|5.0|This is an excellent story that keeps you captured throughout the whole book.  It was diifficult to put it down.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|one of the more interactive games I have on my kindle fire. so much fun to play. I just wish it would stop making it so hard to load back into the game after exiting. literally takes try after try to get back on. if this is a bug, fix it quick!
B005LAIII0|5.0|Heard about this movie before, watched it with great interests. Although sometimes was confused by the accents, captions helped a lot. Great movie for a life lesson.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|She is incredible. Funny, witty, cute, clever, love her to death! She is so fun, and this is her story.
B0030N3O8Y|5.0|Just watched this season again to prepare myself for the upcoming new season next year, and I must say this is the most intense and action-packed season to date.  I enjoyed every seconds of it!
B002W7J3SO|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever made.  Cary Grant is so amazing (they don't make actors like this anymore!) and everything about this movie is fantastic!
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|Man of steel cd is great to listen to and I would tell overs the same .thanks from marisa xx
B0042816YK|3.0|I bought this movie for my wife, she liked it  I only watched parts of it . It seemed OK  for a julia roberts movie.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|just getting going on facebook. It is great to know find out things from family members, helps keep in touch.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is the next best thing..it is virtually the same..thank you it saves me when waiting for any appointment; thanks!
B00AAZOKS8|5.0|My son loved it. He looked at me, then the book and thought it was a movie. Thank you. Look forward to downloading more books.
B001AQMBKA|5.0|I previously owned the DVD versions of Lost seasons 1-3 (with 4-6 on Blu-ray). I was initially on the fence about upgrading to blu-ray but wanted the best experience when I decided to rewatch the entire series. It just didn't feel right not having everything in HD. It was well worth the purchase/upgrade.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|So sad that this journey is over. The book was a magnificent ending to a great series! I hope I can find an equal counter part to read now
B000TFINY6|5.0|I previously owned the DVD versions of Lost seasons 1-3 (with 4-6 on Blu-ray). I was initially on the fence about upgrading to blu-ray but wanted the best experience when I decided to rewatch the entire series. It just didn't feel right not having everything in HD. It was well worth the purchase/upgrade.
B0064W67IM|3.0|I criticized the Kindle HD's reader for graphic novels and comments in my first review because there appeared to be no way to zoom the pages, and at my advanced age I couldn't read the text.  Well I was showing the book to my daughter to see if her young eyes could read it, and she educated me that double-tapping a panel zooms the panel up, and from there swiping as you would to turn pages moves from one panel to the next.  Now I[m able to read this, and this series looks like it's going to be what I'd expect from Neil Gaiman.  It starts off a bit dry and stumbling, but picks up, and I'm looking forward, now, to the next volume.<br /><br />The question remaining, regarding the reader, is this: Why is there nothing about this feature in Kindle help - I went back and looked again to be sure I hadn't missed anything - or at least a note about the panel mode, when you buy the e-book?<br /><br />Finally, take note that the phone and PC versions of the kindle reader will not read the e-book at all.  For those, Comixology zooms, but you have to buy the book a number at a time, rather than being able to by the entire volume.  Also, Comixology has a panel-to-panel function that I got into by accident, once, but I wasn't able to find the key to it the next time.  Again, not a lot in the way of help there, either.
B00E193TM2|5.0|5FDP never disappoints! I'm still listening to the album and every song is big time kick ass! If you're a bit down this album will get your ass up quickly.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|The book made me want to write myself.  Easy, short read and good for any age.  I really enjoyed this book.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I give Percy Jackson a five stars because it has 3 things:<br />  1. Action<br />  2. Drama<br />  3. Humor.<br />I recommend you read this wonderful series. At the end I almost cried because its over. No more Percy Jackson anymore  I will always be a fan though and will always 're read the series
B005HEDI3K|4.0|From the perspective of 60's TV and low-budget Sci-Fi's Star Trek was ahead of it's time and is still hugely entertaining to this day. Barring a few dud episodes, Season 2 is well worth the watch...
B0061S073A|4.0|This app is great for keeping my kids off of my home screen. However, I have two kids who are at different ages. There are games I don't want my youngest to play, but don't mind my older playing. I would love it if I could set up different profiles for each of my children. I give it four stars. It does what it is supposed to. I just wish it were a little different.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|I couldn't stop playing. This game is challenging and addictive. It was hours of fun. I can't wait for the sequel.
B00B1CGDTS|5.0|I have heard a few of the dreary reviews for some versions of the McLintock! film and even had to suffer from a dreadful VHS version years back. The VHS version I had was a dubbed over John Wayne voice, along with a few others in the film to increase the movies &#34;quality&#34;.<br /><br />For those concerned that this Blu-ray version might be lacking - worry no more. This is an EXCELLENT quality version of this movie, and includes a few scenes that I did not ever see on my VHS version. I know there are a few others that have described some of these scenes on the authenticated &#34;Wayne family&#34; version, or whatever it is called, but this must be what they were talking about. My family loves it and was VERY pleased to finally enjoy this movie as it was always intended. The bonus scenes were a very welcome addition, and I can only say I highly recommend you purchase this version of the film.
B003V1WXKU|5.0|Granted this is a memoir, and it has to be taken with a grain of salt, his life as he tells it is incredible.  To have such a well-rounded life and be a Nobel prize winner is something I aspire to.  And I imagine I will continue aspiring to it until I die.
B004SDSSFY|1.0|VERY disappointed.  If you want to view/edit google word-processing files, this DOESN'T WORK.<br /><br />BEING ABLE TO USE GOOGLE DOCS IS A *BASIC* FEATURE OF THIS PROGRAM - *ONE* STAR!<br /><br />In all fairness, it DOES open up google drive spreadsheet files, but not the google drive word processing files!<br /><br />You CAN open a docx file if it's created on your PC on an appropriate program, then uploaded to google drive. (of course, you could just email it to your kindle so what's the damn point?)<br /><br />The AMAZING thing is that if you use this app to create a docx file in Google drive, it won't open the very file it created!<br /><br />In spite of the MANY complaints here at Amazon, the Support pages at dataviz.com don't even offer a disclaimer to this effect.  It seems they don't want to even acknowledge this FUNDAMENTAL, BASIC, PROBLEM.<br /><br />VERY glad I didn't pay full price for it.
2913903878|5.0|I would recomend this book to any collector or person who is interest in military equipment and uniforms. Wasn't hard to revew this book it's great.
B00CKJTOHO|1.0|The Dexter series has run 1 season too long. The writing for Season 7 is pathetic in regards to both plotting and dialogue.
2352500796|5.0|Didn't know there was so much equipement that I never seen before. I can't say enough nice things about this book
B004SOR4H6|3.0|App does what its supposed to do.  Its free and program will provide updates when enough people complain about a bug.
B00007KWHG|5.0|I saw the show &#34;Jersey Boys&#34; and loved it.<br />I ordered the CD so that I could remember what great songs were in the show.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Classic and it was free!  One of the greatest stories of all time.  A must read for every one.  Classic literature!
B002ZG99TA|1.0|The DVD had a flaw in it so we were unable to finish watching it.<br />The company did not have a replacement for it.
B00AKYRCNY|4.0|This game is great for toddlers!  My two year old absolutely loves this game and plays it all the time.  I would have given it 5-stars but ads are in the game downloaded through Kindle Free Time Unlimited.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This game is so much fun. I use it on really long car trips and when I am just plain out bored.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|App does what its supposed to do.  Its free and program will provide updates when enough people complain about a bug.
B00CA3C1N4|5.0|I not longer consider myself \\"a gamer\\", but I must say that this one can keeps me glued to my phone for longer than most recent games I've tried!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I wasn't even aware of this new biography of Jesus until I saw the author interviewed by the dumbest person at Fox News. While the woman interviewer embarrassed herself, the author came across as a very impressive academic. Hey, if FOX News hates it, it must be good. I'm about a third of the way through the book and it is really a terrific read. Not sure what all the negative reviewers object to. I guess they didn't read the book. Glad to see it's number \\"1\\" on Amazon. Thanks FOX News for making me aware of this important work.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|A very timely, modern super fun read.  I'm so thankful that my book club selected this book as one of our next reads.  It's not one I would have picked out for myself, but I loved it!
B0068857QA|5.0|This is one of my favorite television shows and I wish it had been a full series! Excellent writing, plot, acting, and location. Definitely recommend this.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It was one of the best books I've read this year! Just heart breaking and left me speechless! A must read!
B000ICZD4I|5.0|Where do these amazing Southern women come from?  Here's a peek.  And it was written by another grand Southern lady I have always thought would be fine company for iced tea on the porch.  Toss out your grandfather's prejudice about Southerners and see how it really is.  Very well acted by folks who actually are deprived of the natural finesse for living that is being a Southerner.  I dare you to refrain from loving this movie.
0425263924|5.0|This book to me was even better that 50 Shades of Grey, I just learned the the 4th in the series is coming this year and I can't wait to see if she concludes the story.  I hope she does
B001NFNFIK|4.0|If they had stuck to the book more closely, the movie would have been much better, but this isn't bad at all.  Certainly worth the price to renew my fondness for my favorite of the Robicheaux books.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The book was great and I couldnt put it down. I will get the 3rd book to the Hunger Games series.
B0010SKUYM|4.0|After a tedious start, the story and prose become more fluid as the real story unfolds.  The ending was a bit unsatisfying but overall a good read nonetheless, and I'm looking forward to subsequent volumes.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Absolutely LOVE this show and it was so easy having it accessible on my laptop to get caught up and ready for Season 4! Great clarity of scene and sound... highly recommended.<br /><br /> I was a bit frustrated that by the end of the episodes, I was prompted to refresh my Flash player several times before any of them could play, though.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|After reading Ender's Game this was next on my list, and in addition to interesting storyline, I enjoyed the philosophical aspects of the story too.  Certainly this volume is slower paced than Ender's Game but it held my interest thoroughly.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I know its a classic, but I just got around to reading it.  Very good book that takes us for a ride through human psychology in a sci-fi environment.  Ender is a likable character.  Will be interested to see if the movie is any good.  They will have to take a lot of the sub-plots out as there are many in the book.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I don't usually read comics, but I bought this because I just started watching the tv-series and couldn't wait for season 3 to become available on DVD.  The dialogue was less complex than in the show, and there was also more swearing (so it's not really a kid-friendlier option than the intense series).<br /><br />That said, I found the comic book a real page turner.  It was like a parallel universe to the first episodes in the television season 1 - some things were different, some were the same, and some new what-ifs were raised.<br /><br />However, I won't be buying the rest of the comic books on Kindle - not because I don't like the format, but because it's cheaper to buy the compendium.
B005MMY9A8|4.0|glad i didn't spend $12 or $15 at the theater... but i did enjoy it at home and liked it...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's the most realistic horse game ever!! It's fun easy awesome and perfect for animal lovers, not to mention horse lovers!! I highly recommend this app for everyone
B009NY43NY|3.0|Okay, now I knew going into this book that it would be rough.  After not really liking the previous few books in this series (after she started destroying characters and story that I loved), I wasn't really sure how I'd feel about this one.  I borrowed it from the library on audiobook because I didn't really want to buy it.<br /><br />This book wasn't as bad as the previous ones, but it could just be that I fell into the trap of this being the last book of the series.  The author does some in your face things, like tying up any and all loose ends for any character you have ever thought of in relation to Sookie.  For example,  What happened to Quinn?  Wasn't he a giant jerk and then some random cameo in the previous book?  Well you get to see where he ends up.  What about Alcide?  Is he happy?  Is Mustafa gay?  What ever happened to Barry?  Where's Steve Newlin?  The list goes on and on.  I was happy to see where everyone ended up, but it felt like one big epilogue.  For a series that I absolutely loved, and was the reason I got back into reading in a big way, it felt... cheap.<br /><br />Eric, who the author had essentially ruined a few books ago, continued his downward spiral in this book.  We learn bad things, then we learn good things -- I get it, Charlaine Harris, you want to redeem yourself, but I don't buy it.  He was one of the greatest romantic characters in this series that seriously lacks them, and now he's an afterthought.<br /><br />I have to admit that I didn't solve the mystery of who was behind all the badness in this book.  I guess we weren't supposed to, but when it was revealed my reaction was \\"meh\\" -- so many people hate Sookie at this point that I thought it would be a bigger bad.  I guess that about sums up the book -- meh.  At least I don't have to read any more of these and I certainly won't be picking up any of her other books.  I gave it 3 stars because it wasn't poorly written, just was not a good read in general.  When it finished I just shrugged and moved on to another book.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT:<br /><br />This book was really all about Sookie and her being too stupid to realize that Sam wanted her.  I guess it was a romance in that respect, but it felt so completely forced that I was just happy when it was over.  Sookie essentially redeemed Eric herself when all his worries were proven to be founded on fact.  Sigh.  Such a waste.  From the first chapter I knew where the book was headed and it took way too long to get there.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />I was just about to post this review on Amazon when I saw in the same search ---THERE'S ANOTHER FREAKIN' BOOK!  WHAT THE HELL??  It says that it's just a listing of characters and where they end up.  Well, that was really what this book was about so I guess I should've just skipped this one and moved on to the next.  Yuck.  This really leaves a bad taste in my mouth.hrugged and moved on to another book.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT:<br /><br />This book was really all about Sookie and her being too stupid to realize that Sam wanted her.

B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Very challenging, never know what to expect!!! I have no problem playing for long periods of time! I highly recommend!
B000FCKGPC|4.0|I would have given this book almost five stars but there are some slow parts and readers may feel cheated that the writer doesn't spend much time on some of the more interesting characters until the next book. All in all a very good read especially if you are a fan of the series.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I read Fifty Shades of Grey a few days ago. I give congratulations to the author. Yes, the book is erotic, but the story line is amazing. I love the depth of the characters. They are so intriguing, each with their own personal story and how you find out a little more about them the more you read. I have never heard of BDSM before this book and I have to say I was a little shocked. I really wasn't sure if I wanted to continue reading after learning of it, but I gave the rest of the book a chance and I am happy I did. There is a whole amazing world in this book. I look forward to reading the remaining two books of the trilogy. The story of Christian and Anastasia drew me in and kept my mind spinning. Just as Ana wants to know Christian's story, I do too. I can't wait to see what happens between this couple in the next few books.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|my dad and I love this game. he has this addition for candy crush and this game topped it and my dad is a hard nut to crack.
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|I read this book and nowhere in the book does it describe either how to make a bomb or the best way to martyr yourself. I'll stop taking my Risperdal and Zyprexa then the blasphemy will be hitting me in the face.
B007MDB71O|5.0|Literally the best movie ever made. Unfortunately the Disney people screwed up on the way it was marketed to the public. It should have been a blockbuster.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|This game is completely like Mario it is so fun I love how simple and easy to learn I was searching for a Mario app and I found third and just started playing it ten minutes ago and now I'm like pro
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think this game is cool the first time I played it was soooooo fun! it is so much better then the first temple run.
B000L212HC|4.0|It's a good movie with a lot of stars, a very good script and an rare end.  I recommended, definitely.
B00CZAYL76|5.0|This is another great 5FDP album, and it has shattered all of my expectations.  Every song is strong enough to stand on its own as a single, yet they blend perfectly into a dozen track procession into hell and back.  &#34;Wrong Side of Heaven&#34; is rightfully the title track with its powerful chorus and moody yet thoughtful lyrics.  &#34;Anywhere but Here&#34; featuring the lovely Maria Brink, is another standout track, while 5DP's cover of &#34;Momma said Knock You Out&#34; will have you thinking that LL Cool J's classic was meant to be a metal song all along.  Easily the most balanced album they have ever created, with &#34;Burn MF&#34; &#34;You&#34;, and &#34;Dot Your Eyes&#34; forming the angry core while melodic tracks like the ballad &#34;M.I.N.E&#34; give it an outside appeal.  All in all, an excellent offering, and a must have for all Knuckleheads!
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|I'm from Germany and find the new album of the Backstreet Boys just great. A pop song that go better than the other and a lot of great melodies in his ear. The best album in years.
B004IPPINW|5.0|I was a bit wary of this book when I purchased it but once I started I discovered it was superbly written. It follows a coversation between a Pakistan middle class muslim and an American ' tourist ' in a market in Lahore. It relates the life story of the pakistani who was a high flyer in New York and tells the tale of how he gave it all up to return to Pakistan.<br /><br />The author really captures the inner turmoil which the main character battles as he struggles to come to terms with the changes in the USA after 9/11.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book very entertaining and I fell gives an insight into how many ordinary muslims may have felt after these world changeing events.
157330087X|4.0|This is a very good blend of great blues artist's music, and interviews and commentary.  It's always good to see Buddy Guy!!
B005544TRQ|4.0|great dialogue, characters good interaction, pulls no punches. watched a whole season in two days...very gripping, makes you wanna be a lawyer
030758836X|2.0|Tough to get into for the first 50 pages. Hated Both characters.  Absolutely despised her by the end. Sick characters and an awful ending. Ugh!
B00881VLCE|5.0|It's a fun game. A great way to pass the time while waiting in a Doctors office or just having to wait for anything!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is fun but not as fun as New super Mario bros it's not as fun because it needs more power ups like a gold Leprechauns or more than 1 Lep
B005544TRQ|5.0|Just when I thought today's television was lacking, Suits proves me wrong. This show is smart, funny and entertaining!  Something my husband and I can watch together.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I love sci-fi and this has good guys and bad guys and it's not always easy to tell which is which - much like real life.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Makes all the difference.. I wish the tools and settings were a little more intuitive.  Or that it was easier to perceive level changes between the stacks.. but for a two d render of a 3 d game it does a good job
B004DLPXAO|5.0|this is a great app!!  I can use it anywhere and get the best books.  Its great being able to read anywhere
B00CTXBO9M|5.0|Best game evarrr but the upgrade isnt working on my kindle fire amazing game but.one problem it doesnt have budder seriosly guys get dat budder
B00CZAYNOC|1.0|I listened to this record today and was not impressed. The problem's of this record stem mostly from Ivan Moody's lyrics. I was blow away with how intelligent the lyrics are. In the song 'I.M.Sin' Moody declares \\"You're a poser. That's all you'll ever be.\\" The cover of Mama said knock you out has to be the most cringe worthy thing I have heard on a record.<br />The only thing that is not upsetting about this record is that some of the solos are actually tasteful and somewhat impressive.<br />This is run of the mill forgettable metal record with kindergarten lyrics.
B0028IDXDS|4.0|Aside from the fact that the stuffed toy is sewn onto the pacifier it's great for my 3 month old the paci doesn't bounce all over when he spits it out and he can put it back into his own mouth it's easy to find since it really can't fall behind him when he is in a swing or bouncy seat! Plus it's really cute. Wish it could detach from the paci just for better cleaning
B000E5N62U|4.0|\\"Morph the Cat\\" from 2006, is Donald Fagen's third solo album. Apart from the absence of Steely Dan's partner Walter Becker, the musicians are almost the same as on Steely Dan's latest album from 2003 \\"Everything Must Go\\". The sound is thus not surprisingly very similar to Steely Dan's, and as Fagen also takes care of the vocals in the group, it can be difficult to detect differences between Steely Dan and Fagen solo.
140006922X|5.0|Zealot is a well written literary piece about the times that Jesus lived in. It is fascinating how the social and political times Jesus lived in have been repeated over and over these past 2000 years. Reza Azlan's book is not going to change your beliefs, that is clearly not his intent. I think this book does perform a miracle by bringing alive people, places and circumstance that formed a belief system that has endured. this book makes you wonder what it is about Jesus and the human spirit that doesn't quit in the face of all adversity. I couldn't put it down!<br /><br /> if anything,<br />,
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This was a really good book I think these young guy today in the Services have it worst than i did in the 50's my prayers are with all of them , Chris's wife and childrenas well.
140006922X|1.0|This is a tactic the devil has been using since the beginning of time - write a book attacking the greatest man who's ever lived and watch sales fly through the roof. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Hope you enjoy all the money you're making Mr. Aslan as it will be short lived - JESUS CHRIST OWNS THIS WORLD
B009WUBERW|4.0|Then they take the awesome to the highest level possible, and that is where it goes wrong.<br />It just becomes over the top.<br /><br />BTW, if you have any knowledge of firearms, combat, or physics beware.<br />This is a Stallone movie.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|Excellent, funny, charming. Great for the whole family.  Also see Despicable Me II. It's just as good and so funny.
B005HEVBGG|5.0|This is a great first season based on the Star Trek universe, but set in a far away part of the galaxy to create new situations and set up more interesting challenges for the crew of the Voyager.
B000LXHK22|4.0|Good product, good timing, happy with price. I recommend this love/romance movie to all who are into just that! Enjoy!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini has shown what an excellent writer he is, one more time! This is such a sensitive story that deals with family relationships, and delves deeply into emotions most writers don't touch.  I am a fan!
B00B1CGD5M|5.0|Wow, this totally blows away the last few albums and totally worth the wait.  Good job, fellas!  This double disc has stayed in my player for weeks!  Great musicianship, great songwriting, and catchy lyrics.
B00AGJ4HC2|5.0|It's a unique game for sure.  As each round progresses, it quickly becomes known what cards remain, and you're able to start deducing who potentially has what based on what they've played, and what remains.  Great amounts of fun in a velvet sack.  Buy it!
B008EKON56|5.0|The analog (headphone) out on the iPhone 4s and lower, as well as iPods, is not nearly as &#34;clean&#34; a signal as the output from the sync/charge port.  This simple adapter allows the bottom port produce a clean line-level signal that sounds much clearer when used with headphone amplifiers, and as a sweet bonus, you can still charge and sync your device with a STANDARD USB cable!  You can't go wrong!
0812982622|5.0|Nuanced and intimately detailed.  This is a masterpiece.  After delicious twists and turns the John Doe of North Korea becomes the hero's hero.
B0053KWDES|5.0|I have the old, useless E3, which is no longer available.  It was junk and for years I never thought of getting another FiiO product.  However, after glowing reviews of some of their higher end portable amps, and after a few friends started buying expensive, form-fitted in-ear monitors and buying said portable amps, I grew interested.<br /><br />I decided to try this more mid-end consumer one for my iPhone, and haven't turned back.  It also serves as a pre-amp for my car, giving me a few well-need decibels from my car's aux input!  The EQ settings are kind of nice, albeit slight, since you might need to change the scoop of cheaper headphones during an extended session.  Plus, your ears may fatigue a bit faster, since this amp may bring out the &#34;characteristics&#34; (read: uneven equalization) of some headphones.<br /><br />So far I've tried over a dozen sets of earbuds and headphones.  Some of my headphones (such as my $40 AKGs) now &#34;thump&#34; to the bass!  Incredible!  My in-ear buds now completely enrobe my ears in sound, blocking all outside noise, and I actually don't need to turn them up as high to do so, since the sound projection is more even.  Even my $4 ear buds from DX sound great!<br /><br />The battery life is excellent, unless for some reason you decide to put it on full blast all of the time or forget to turn it off.<br />My only gripe is that the battery cover may take a little figiting (bending) to keep from falling off.  The tabs holding the panel could have been half a millimeter thicker and this wouldn't have been a problem.  I eventually used a needle-nose pliers to gently bend the metal and it's been good to me ever since.<br /><br />Oh, and don't think these things are just good for music.  Movies sound incredible, and I also love using it on my PSP and DS.
B008RA3X5E|2.0|Although this app was good, it had adware that my security app picked up. Adware is what companies use to acquire your information to sell to other companies
159514188X|5.0|This was in really great condition it was everything I expected it to be and more it came brand new in the box and everything
B009ZZDNT6|2.0|I'm not really satisfied with this unit. Wasted my money. Have seen other units that meets my needs. Looks attractive though. Sorry!
B004HWYTP4|3.0|My husband, myself and 14 year old son enjoyed the movie.  The problem was streaming it through our xbox.  Suddenly the film would pause.  I imagine it was buffering.  It was somewhat frustrating to watch an action movie that suddenly pauses.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Well written, fresh take on a legal show! I highly recommend! the two leads have great chemistry and are handsome too!
B0018OFN2W|5.0|Paul Walker = yum! It's the perfect &#34;I'm bored and don't know what to watch&#34; movie. I would recommend it to the following demographics: Kids 8-15, and adults 18-35.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Got this for my bedroom TV which is not hooked to cable.  Was up and running in less than 10 minutes. Youtube, Play Music and Play Movies work like a charm.  The mirroring of Chrome tabs on my laptop is laggy however but frankly I'm at the far reaches of my weak wifi plus it's beta so hopefully will get better with time.  It's 100% intuitive and the remote and interface is as easy as it gets: there is none!  That is the brilliance of this thing: grab whatever device you got, hit the cast button and that's it.<br /><br />Personally I think Google has a huge winner here and I really hope to see that little cast icon on more and more apps asap!
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Bought the CD after watching Bocelli's Portofino concert on PBS.  Can't wait for a DVD of the concert to be available.
0321714113|5.0|Cons:<br />No answers available for the exercises, so you continue unsure if you are on the correct path<br /><br />Pros:<br />Exercises practically on every page to test your knowledge on all topics covered. A great way to truly learn.<br /><br />This has always been the book I compare all other programming books to.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|Enjoyable mind bender. These games get addicting. They cause you to think way out of the box. Who's twisted mind thinks of these things?
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Found this game to be fun but quite a challenge. Some of the puzzles were hard to decipher. Relied on hints a lot which took away from the game. Enjoyed playing and would recommend this game. I thought $2.99 was a bit much.
B005F3GMAO|5.0|I have just finished reading Richard Branson's autobiography, 'Losing My Virginity'. This was a refreshingly candid glimpse into Branson's heart, revealing his early hopes and dreams, describing his entrepreneurial mind and his motivations. It is a chronological progression, beginning with motivating challenges from age eleven, moving through teen-age endeavours right through to recent developments.<br /><br />I was fascinated by how he would look for solutions to challenges in one area and see opportunities through that for significant change or at times even a completely new venture. As an example; he couldn't raise the finance to upgrade the seat-back entertainment systems for the handful of planes of his airline at the time, so he called the CEO of Boeing to talk about it and ended up ordering 16 new planes. It was easier to finance that expansion than the simple upgrade, so Virgin found itself with the newest planes of any other airline at the time. Talk about leaps of faith!<br /><br />In the latter pages he describes his growing awareness of the precarious state of our world, and realises his unique position to take tangible, constructive action. In particular, he assembled a significant group of 'Global Elders' (including Nelson Mandela and other world-changing names) to address some of these world problems and find viable solutions. I was hooked here because I have written about this extensively myself in my non-fiction book [[ASIN:B00AODFMY2 FutureQuest]]. Branson puts the rubber to the road himself by ensuring that all his business enterprises aim for highest possible sustainability with smallest possible ecological footprint.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the read and learned valuable lessons in the process. I realised early that I needed to give this book priority time, to get the most out of it. Highly recommended.
B005ES0Z9O|4.0|Once u get the right. size they are fun, comfortable, and easy to wear.  They run large- so if u have wide feet- suggest 1 size smaller and stay with medium which are plenty wide .
B0079J28NW|5.0|Peter Max, the Beatles, psychedelia, its all here. Although the Beatles involvement was limited, their spirit is all over this funny and off-beat film. Picture Fantasia, done with pop art. Great for parents, kids, families... Highly rated.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I simply love this playing Mahjong, all Mahjong games, I find them relaxing.I love playing games.....some more than others, of course.
B00DFFHUUA|1.0|This movie was doomed from the start. They managed to get one main actor back (Channing Tatum as Duke) for this film and then made the movie about a different batch of characters. Spoiler alert: they kill Duke in the first act of the film. They do it for no reason. The movie was not better served, the plot wasn't advanced in any way. If anything it left a hole in the cast where the 3 remaining Joe's need to then get help later on. The actors all did their job the problem was the story, there wasn't much of one. It tied together the few loose ends from the first film and left an opening for a 3rd film if the studio wanted to throw some more money away. Or maybe they could use that money a little wiser and have a better script before they started shooting.<br />If you decide &#34;Hey I'll check it out, its an action movie, how bad can it be.&#34; Its bad. This was my thought, &#34;It's G.I. Joe, how do you screw it up.&#34; Well it was screwed up. Unless you are a huge fan of Dwayne Johnson wait for it to hit the movie channels.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I would, and do, recommend Magic Jigsaw Puzzles to all my friends, and anybody else who'll listen.  I am totally HOOKED.
0321701763|3.0|It is a big improvement than an earlier version that was written for CS3.  There are a few unclear places in it and that is why I rated it as OK.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Fun game for everyone. My kids LOVE it and I like it. Wish there were more than the two levels.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Downton Abbey is the series for anyone who loves aristocratic England in the early centuries.  I love the costumes, the way of life. It is kept clean--no nudity and fowl language.  Very enjoyable for the whole family.  Plus, I believe that a lot of us would love be an aristocrat.  It is a way to pretend to be such in a series like this.
B003V6L94Q|5.0|I am extremely happy with this music and play it often in my car and at work- highly recommend this.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game works great on my kindle fire. It also runs smoothly on my samsung aviator. Takes time to download but it is worth the wait.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I have never played this game but my 6 year old loves it and plays it all the time....I have not heard any complaints so far.
B002DPRLEI|5.0|This movie is just plain fun! I have watched it over and over and still get tickled at certain parts.
B00DAXXO98|4.0|I do not watch alot of television because most of it cannot keep my attention but Kevin Spacey<br />does a great job taking you inside the cut throat world of Washington Politics and the obsessed<br />people that do their bidding. Can't wait for season 2.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Nice little game to make you think. It is fun to play to pass the time. Only complaint is my big fingers have trouble clicking on the right spot.
B00C5ZORES|4.0|When i started listening to this cd it starts off great.  The music is very up beat, but toward the middle and end is kind of disappointing.  Got this cd for a great price on amazon, so i don't regret the purchase.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Lots of action, mixed with some really good comedic relief! John Malkovick (please excuse spelling) plays the part of crazy very well, as usual!
B00B81B0HC|5.0|Bought this after my boyfriends sister let us listen to the album on our recent road trip.  Fell in love with this group and the cd after one round of listening to it.  Each song is amazing...bought this through amazon mp3 and it's one of the best cd's i have bought in a long time.  If you buy this cd you wont be disappointed.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|One of the best shows available on Amazon Instant Video, I love Downton Abbey and hope for it to be available next season also.
0800129806|5.0|How can you go wrong with Sean Connery?  Especially with Julia Ormond and Richard Gere.<br />Very entertaining, even the bad guys!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I LOVE that The Walking Dead Season 3 was available  on Amazon Instant Video, the next day after the original air date. I wish for Season 4 to also be available come October 14th, 2013 and all other future episodes of The Walking Dead.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This is good money to spend on a game and if your wondering my other best game that's 99&cent; is call of mini zombies<br />But this a great game worth the money
B00CEB5QU2|5.0|I was fortunate to discover this little marvel in a magazine related to Apple IPad products.<br /><br />I carry an IPad Mini everywhere in my law practice but have always wished there was an easy way to bring along documents for review while traveling. This gadget is Awesome! Takes up no space, allows use of SD cards or flash drives and is wireless. So now my IPad has been essentially transformed! It was EASY to set up and does everything it says it will do.<br />GET ONE!!!
B005T87QCI|3.0|The reason I'm rating three stars is because of some of the things I couldn't do. Like I thought I could create my own robot and use atom and Zeus but I have to buy them to use them but overall it's a good game.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Loved Season 3.  I had missed watching Season 3 during the regular season showing and Amazon was the only place I could find it.  Thank you!
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Great product! Looks nice and works very well! It charges both my wife and mine Android phones and the Apple port is quicker!
B005ES0XVO|5.0|These are WIDE and for me that is great.  I normally wear a 10 1/2 3E.  These fit great.  The soles are thick and comfortable.  I hope this model is not discontinued as sometimes happens when you find something good.  Think I will buy an extra pair.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This was an entertaining novel with a gentle twist at the conclusion.  There were times of humor, times of sadness, and times of injustice.  The author had a way with the Irish language and provided wonderful descriptions, texture, and visuals for the readers to digest.
B005LAIGOQ|5.0|I am a huge Daniel Radcliffe fan.  I had gone to see this movie at the theater, and my son and I really liked it.  Was glad that I could find it for a great price on Amazon!
B0095MVOMC|4.0|Tests your eyes. Still have a few that I have one number I can't find. Might be easier if larger
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|Easy to read  and hard to put down. Just when I thought it was slowing down, the storyline took another twist.
B0058YPGVQ|5.0|Bought for my son as a ChristmaS gift. he has me hooked on the show. We watch it every week
B0083GOVLW|5.0|I've read the comics and the movie really does them justice.  This is sad, funny, and angering.  What a great history lesson too! Absolutely wonderful.
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|I love Criominal Minds. I watch every show I can even if it is a repeat. So I started from the beginning. I did have a CD from a different series that had nothing on it.
B005PK57NU|5.0|I CANNOT stop watching! When one episode is done...you can't wait to watch the next one. Great quality...I'm still finishing up this season, so who knows what will happen.
0345529057|5.0|bought for my son as a Christmas gift. He loves to watch the shows but like to read them also
B005RDF2NA|5.0|Movie was great quality! We purchased this because we had ALL of the other Shrek movies, but not the original.
B002E0JL4A|5.0|perfect for family, classroom, and even a date! My boyfriend and I loved this movie so much! It is such a great  story
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|Listening to this album just proves one thing - Adam Lambert is a musical genius. This album took me on a roller coaster ride of musical highs and highers, with no lows. Adam is a vocal chameleon. The way he weaves his voice into the different songs is breathtaking. From empowerment (Trespassing) to fun (cuckoo) to joy (naked love) and to raw emotion (underneath), his voice mesmerises and reach into your soul. The lyrics are achingly honest and he sings them with integrity and feelings. Unlike For Your Entertainment which was a little over-processed, this album was very balanced and show-cased Mr Lambert's voice exquisitely.<br />This album challenges you not to fall in love with it. As for me, I concede defeat. I am thoroughly smitten and besotted by this album. It will be a gem that will glitter for a long long time to come. (A Malaysian Glambert)
B0098G7AWS|5.0|I had never seen this movie but my boyfriend said that we should watch it. He was right, it is a fabulous film!
B00DGABUIC|5.0|This was a great item to receive, it should be noted it is simply a figure and does very little besides being able to adjust the head. However the item is an adorable and a very detailed and accurate miniature figurine of the character from the film, I was quite pleasantly surprised at the amount of detail it had. A perfect item for collectors and lovers of the film. I'm very excited to have bought it and highly recommend it to young fans who wish for a &#34;cuter&#34; 'How to Train your Dragon' piece of merchandise and for all fans who wish for a piece of merchandise from this franchise that is worth collecting. I love this item, and I feel like those who love this film and character would too. :)
B000RO9VJK|5.0|Very good read for the business man or woman. I will read it again to refresh the ideas, big help.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love the game but dislike the fact that it freezes. I would love to see the creators of this game add more wonderful things to this awesome game. I enjoy it think it has great graphics and would highly  recommend it. I gave it 4 stars only because of the freezing issues. It still only freezes every on certain and a while and starts working immediately after it freezes up. I still love it and I think you will too. Everyone  who is interested in it should definitely download it.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Love the show. Strikes a good balance between Personal stories and their professional work.<br />Anyhow who is a professional and aspires to be one will like it.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|A great game to play when you have the time. It takes a while to get strong, unless you buy.  I've played the other Dragon hunters and they keep getting better
B002BRRTUO|3.0|Good for wasting an afternoon , not oscar material but entertaining. Basic hero saves the world and gets the girl fare. Based on early serials plot is thin and the effects cheap but the dialog is funny and the Queen soundtrack rocks literally. Flash Gordon star quarter back and Dale Arden pretty face travel agent are kidnapped by eccentric DR Zarkov and fly to planet  Mongo on a rocket ship to save the earth from the bad guy. Flash must rescue Dale from Ming the merciless and save earth at the same time. Brian Blessed as Voltan chief of the Hawkmen provides some comic relief.
B000001DWG|5.0|love it , brings back alot of memories! back in the early 90's the music was better than it is now!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it this app is so much fun ...the only thing that needs to be changed is that it needs more free point things that you can do in less than 5 minutes and that can be free... other than that this app is awesome
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|Guys it's the original Backstreet Boys, Amazing album, They are ahead of world music by far :D, Don't hesitate to buy...
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|a really fun game buy I don't like how a lot of the missions involve friends cuz I don't have a Facebook. once you have missions you can't get out out of them without tokens and I don't have enough so right now I'm stuck with all three friend-involving missions.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|This app is really cool! It has a mario feel to it and is super addictive. It is a must have!
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|A good take on a old story.  I really enjoyed the show, although not a kids show I enjoyed. Watch it.
8866134627|5.0|This is my favorite Moleskine thus far, and I buy far too many of these journals to begin with.  This has replaced my daily work diary as my go-to journal.  I was worried it wouldn't be around for long, so I bought 5 more just to be sure I have them for the future.
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|I really like the Piano Guys, and I was looking forward to getting this album.  The one issue with it is the same as with the last album -- namely that I own three albums: &#34;Hits, Volume 1&#34;, &#34;The Piano Guys&#34;, and &#34;The Piano Guys 2&#34;, which have 36 tracks but only 29 distinct songs.<br />Come on guys, you've made more music than that, and you know I don't want to buy the same tracks over and over again!<br /><br />Other than that small issue, this album is great, and I highly recommend it.
B0031RS2HC|5.0|Good read as all the other Reacher stories.. I read Diane Capri's Don't Know Jack before this one and then decided I had to know what had happened. I recommend reading this one before Diane Capri's Don't Know Jack
B00B7Y0206|2.0|I was on the app and i couldn't even scroll down before it stopped working<br />I restarted  it and it still didn't work. BOOOOOOO
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|What is it about complicated men?  We can't leave them alone in life and in word.  Love this book (and series.).
B0031RS4UM|5.0|This is yet another excellent fast moving Lee Child story with, as usual, a cleaverly descised twist at the end.
B008Y5OW20|5.0|I grew up listening to ELO and Lynne's solo stuff. I don't see how his voice can still sound this good, but it's as good as ever.  This album is a real gem, filled with the dreamy sounds and lush harmonies that one would expect from Jeff Lynne. Perfection!
B0031RS44S|5.0|I have now nearly read all of the Jack Reacher series and still find that I am unable to guess the ending.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Absolutely fascinating and entertaining. Makes you want to finish all the episodes in one seating.  Can't wait for the 4th season.
B0031RS4V6|5.0|I find it amazing that Lee Child can keep producing such good and exciting books while still keeping the main character.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This game is awesome. making contraptions that blow drive and explode all over the place. I recommend getting this game
B0031RS2HC|5.0|I just love the way Lee Child manages to write such a thrilling story which is so hard to put down.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Awesome for building you own city<br /> Amazing for young children and adults who are not to mixture awesome if your bird
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|This series is amazing. Never a full episode. Forever one of my all time favorite shows. You never know what is going to happen.
B008OOYALE|5.0|this game is phenomenal!  I love it love it love it! ive been playing for months they update often never gets old. download this game!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This the app you need to always have your book with you.  It is great to be open your book anytime you can.
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|While I found the novel depressing I was unable to put it down.  The author did a good job of keeping my interest up even though I wanted to quit reading.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved it, hated him, loved her ended up hating her in the end.  Kept me on the edge of my seat.  You just never know.
B007REV4YI|1.0|Hate the movie. Not what I expected from Bond. I understand what the director was trying to do, but very disappointed in the movie. I like gadgets. Not characteristic of Bond. Nice action, but story was weak. What kind of a name is skyfall for the place? Will sell it on ebay.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Romantic and intriguing. Shows you just how far a man will go to meet his lucky charm and the love of his life.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Can't really go wrong if you like Marvel. I really like all of the characters and it its great that the movie is free with Prime.
B006QYFWN4|5.0|Landmark Book. The Benchmark Study by Which All Subsequent Texts on Human Research will be Measured.  The China Study will lead the reader to a plethora of other authors and studies, that could frankly change your health and those you love.
140006922X|5.0|I was born a Christian , I am a Christian , I will die a Christian.<br />This book is NOT anti-Christian. I repeat it is NOT anti-Christian.<br /><br />The interview of Laura Green with Reza Aslan was the most horrible interview I have had the unfortunate luck to have watched. I literally cringed everytine this ignorant and ill- prepared woman ( Laura Green) asked a question.<br />If you're interested in the historic Jesus of Nazareth this book will not dissapoint.<br />BTW.... The author's mother IS a Christian and so is his wife.
0770437400|4.0|I enjoyed the book despite the unusual literary form used (first person accounts of the war from many different view points).
B0083Z614S|5.0|This book is chock full of good messages for us all!  Think happy thoughts, crowd out the bad ones, life is good.
B001EBYMAI|5.0|I adore Keanu Reeves as an actor, this film was great, as as usual Keanu is amazing, and there was even romance!
006178480X|5.0|James Rollins incorporates science and suspense wonderfully together to keep his readers enthralled from beginning to end.  I highly recommend this novel, and entire series, to readers who enjoy thrill and intrigue.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I tried getting into The Shield around season 4 or 5 before we dumped the satellite dish & just couldn't do it -there seemed to be too much I didn't know about what came before. Starting with season 1 -a much different story! This might not be the best show for people who can't separate reality from fiction and get upset at the depiction of violence, but the main characters are very interesting -there are at least two that (by the end of season 1) I can't figure out - good but flawed or flat out psycho? Well meaning or terminally self-interested?  Maybe they're one thing but will morph into the other? I don't like characters to be too easy to figure, and this series delivers on that score. Give it a try - and start at the beginning.
B005OT2YVA|1.0|Too much focus on sexual content that had nothing to do with the story<br />It is unfortunate to see the trend in some movies.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|If you haven't started reading these, what the hell are you waiting for?<br /><br /> A nice big book following numerous characters around. Some of your favorites will die, don't expect happy endings. The HBO series does a pretty good job with them, so you can get an idea of what they are about. Great for airplane flights and sitting on the beach. Not a quick read.
B00BGIC4I6|4.0|husband and I watched it... reminded of our life now with the kids, even though ours are growing to be 'bigger&#34; boys :-)
B002SSUQFG|5.0|I would like to preface this review by stating that I am not a watch guru, this is my first automatic watch, and I have been wearing a different, expensive Seiko for 10 years. I did do quite a bit of research before making this purchase.<br /><br />As many other reviews have noted: the movements are most definitely NOT Japanese. The underside of the watch literally says &#34;MOVEMENT MALAYSIA&#34;. However, I have not experienced any significant issues with time in my first week of usage. For $60 I think a high-quality Malaysia movement is fine.<br /><br />Let's go over each individual part of the watch:<br /><br />The face (at a glance):<br />The black background with white hands and white ticks make it a very readable face.<br />The second hand is almost a fluid motion -- different than the 1 second &#34;tick&#34; I'm used to.<br />I tested the luminosity when I went to the theater for a movie. After a little more than an hour I was still able to tell the time easily.<br />The SEIKO and &#34;5&#34; logos are not distracting and accent the stainless steel design wonderfully.<br />The stainless steel design itself is subtle, sleek, and looks more expensive than it is.<br />The date window is easy to read and convenient but the day and date begin to flip at least a few hours before midnight.<br />The crown is really a very decent size. No complaints there.<br /><br />The band:<br />As stated in a few other reviews the band is slimmer than I expected (about the width of two #2 pencils)<br />As my first canvas band I don't have anything to compare it to but I feel like it needs to be worn in. Irritated my wrist occasionally.<br />The buckle on the strap works fine. Nothing really fancy which is kind of nice.<br /><br />The underside:<br />Being able to see the inside of the watch is pretty neat but if this is a watch meant to be worn a lot. It is pretty cool to look at the innards!<br />Some other reviews mentioned an almost &#34;grindy&#34; feeling when walking. I can't feel the mainspring weight while I'm walking and can only feel it if I hold the watch with my other hand and shake my watch-wrist. I don't consider it an issue.<br /><br />Overall:<br />A really wonderful, quality entry-level automatic watch. If you're a guru then you know what $60 gets you so this watch shouldn't be a surprise. If you're not you will be pleasantly surprised spending $60 for this level of quality.<br /><br />Things to consider:<br />Your wrist size. Other reviewers and the info on the watch are available. I didn't measure before I bought and I was surprised at how small it was but not disappointed.<br />If you have had a canvas band before you know what you're getting into. Otherwise you might consider buying something else or wearing this often enough that it gets worn in. As other reviews have said it does get &#34;itchy&#34; sometimes.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Inexpensive (NOT cheap!)<br />Beautiful design<br />Not bulky<br />Accurate time for the price<br /><br />CONS:<br />Watch band is skinny and &#34;itchy&#34;<br /><br />I have and will continue to recommend this watch to friends. I fully recommend and back this purchase.
B0001M0A4I|5.0|Tony Banks had been a member of the hugely successful British progressive rock band Genesis, but sometimes found his talents overshadowed by the two soon-to-be superstars that led the group at various times in the 70s and 80s, namely Peter Gabriel and Phil Collins.  Fortunately, his talents managed to find a significant outlet with his debut classical work \\"Seven: A Suite For Orchestra\\", which the London Philharmonic Orchestra performs under Mike Dixon on this 2004 recording for Naxos.<br /><br />Outside of Genesis, Banks had also been involved in the fine art of scoring motion pictures, including 1983's THE WICKED LADY, THE SHOUT (with fellow Genesis member Mike Rutherford), LORCA AND THE OUTLAWS, and QUICKSILVER; and a lot of this experience is bought to bear in this work, which, like a lot of the greatest film music, straddles the fine line between serious classicism and the popular idiom.  The suite itself, taking up close to fifty-eight minutes, is a marvel, consisting of the following: (1) Spring Tide; (2) Black Down; (3) The Gateway; (4) The Ram; (5) Earthlight; (6) Neap Tide; and (7) The Spirit Of Gravity.  Banks himself is featured on piano on three of the seven pieces in the suite, notably \\"Spring Tide.\\"  It may be of interest to note that \\"The Gateway\\" was actually intended as part of a score Banks had intended to composer for the 1984 film \\"2010\\" (the Peter Hyams-directed sequel to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY), before Hyams eventually went with veteran film composer David Shire instead.  Like its other six companions, it definitely fits into any situation.<br /><br />Banks himself produced this recording along with Nick Davis; and the suite is given a superb performance by the London Philharmonic under Dixon's magnificent direction.  This recording also exemplifies once again the high-budget sound quality of the low-budget Naxos label, which has produced some of the best classical recordings, both of established war horses and newer works like \\"Seven\\", over the last twenty-plus years.  This is a recording well worth acquiring.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|The dvd came quickly and is a great movie for the entire family.  It can be difficult to follow at first, yet the viewer easily gets pulled into the characters and plot.  Good music- just listen  closely as the songs tell the plot of the story.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|You tube became problematic quite suddenly.  This app allows my family to watch videos on You Tube via the app on the Fire HD.
B00DHSK3RM|4.0|okay these reviews are all about how this isn't the real game....uhm the name is Candy Crush LEVELS HELP GUIDE. not Candy Crush Saga. It's meant to help with the game. I understand its weird that they have this and not the game but giving this app a bad review wont change this app to the game. This is good for helping when your stuck. 4 stars.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I LOVED THIS BOOK! I couldn't stop reading it and I was on vacation! I would and DO recommend this book!
B00DHNBPA6|4.0|A total revamp of  an old classic. Nothing like the cheesy classic, a must see, and gory to the bitter end!
B002EEP3NO|5.0|THanks for the product. My son loves it and enjoys building it and so far all the pieces are there.
B00992CF6W|5.0|i cant believe fmhow fun this game is ever since 0.7.1 came out.  its the best game ever. my favorite thing to do in it is to kill mobs and mine budder for budder weapons budder armor and budder blocks.
0061122416|5.0|It's a simple story, and that's what adds such richness to the complexity. With so many layers of understanding, this books draws me in time after time, and I get something new from it with each reading. Definitely a keeper!
B009R659L8|5.0|I could not stop reading... it was one of her best...Multiple plots really worked well...and kept me intrigued. I recommend it.
0060873175|1.0|The town library had a great idea: wrap a bunch of novels in brown paper, include a review sheet, and place on a centrally located table. Urge patrons to 'expand' their reading selections by picking up an unknown entity, taking it home to unwrap and explore!<br />I received 'Micro' and right away didn't like the idea of the photo of a large bug on the cover when I removed the brown paper - I immediately covered it with a sticky note. I began reading and immediately was a bit put off by the stilted conversations of the characters as well as the central premise that was unfolding. To enjoy this book, I believe one must go into complete 'suspended belief of the laws of physics' by page 2.  Continuing on in explorer mode, my view did not change; the central storyline, the characters, the settings, etc. challenged my ability to suspend rational thought. I began thinking, 'and I put my Daniel Silva on hold to read this?' and trudged on to page 100, when I finally began to mull over the possibility of not finishing the novel. By page 115, I decided to check the book's reviews on Amazon, smiled while reading several, and promptly threw in the towel, feeling quite sure I was doing the right thing. After 115 pages of poor writing skills and silly plot lines, I can say the work has no redeeming value. Enough said, don't bother.
B001AQT0RC|5.0|Stands up to the test of time. Still enjoyable today, nearly two decades after its release. Definitely worth watching again!
B003WUYP56|5.0|This is an enjoyable read; the physics is presented in an entertaining way, and who doesn't love a good enlightening argument. Smolin has been told once in a public forum (a BBC debate) that his arguments don't belong in such a mass-produced book and should be kept in-house on the arxiv.  Much of modern physics is funded by tax-payers, and Smolin does them a great service bringing this debate to their attention. Needless to say, the opposing side to this debate also have their books, Susskind's \\"The Cosmic Landscape\\" would be a good companion book to this one, for example.  Finally, it should be noted that this debate has been over-hyped in the press; science in general is full of energetic and sometimes vociferous debates.  It is a strength, and so Smolin's book shouldn't be seen as a sign of of disunity as much as it is a representation--in pop-science format--of the healthy back-and-forth that goes on in the field.
B005HEVBGG|5.0|I didn't get to see this in its first run as our local Fox station preempted it for something truly forgettable. This appears to have all the episodes, from beginning to ???
B000009HF2|5.0|I've been listening to this since 1976 and it never gets old.  Peter Frampton is a superior on this.  Lots of good material.
B008K9SG9K|4.0|Every song on the album has a powerful story to tell with energetic lyrics and music that harmonize very well together.  There are no filler tracks here.  A very dynamic, exciting, and sincere work.
B000I5X80G|5.0|Neil and Crazy Horse playing all of the old favorites.  I haven't listened to this one in a while, think I pop it in the deck first chance I get.
B000IDCJK8|5.0|Great movie one of his best western. why do I have to put so many words down when only a few will do?
B0000025KI|5.0|This is a great effort by Springsteen with lots of picturesque songs from a native New Jersyian.  When Bruce was Bruce.
B007MDB71O|5.0|Took my eldest boys and a couple of their friends to see John Carter when it was out in theaters. They were all literally on the edge of their seats for the entire film, from beginning to end. The nonstop action and exotic production design had them all mesmerized. For the first time they were seeing a film with a real story, it had them engaged and even debating the characters' actions before the lights came up. I couldn't help but fight back a tear as I thought how much my father would have enjoyed this loving adaptation of the Edgar Rice Boroughs novels, an author he first introduced me to, long ago.<br />When the credits finished rolling I looked down the row of beaming boys and asked how they liked it?<br />\\"Awesome!\\" was the united reply, shouted as if they had rehearsed it.<br />I have to agree, it was awesome. Not since the Fellowship of the Ring has a film given me such pleasure. The joy and respect the creators of this film have for the source material comes through in every frame.<br />Do yourselves a favor and make time to see it.
B000002UAX|5.0|My favorite Beatles album.  All the best.  I never get tired of listening to this release.  Birthday, Back In The USSR, Dear Prudence, Lady Madonna, I'm So Tired, Helter Skelter, nothing but the best!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I've read similar books about the SEALs but this one really sticks out.  The author makes a great point about the separation between the politicians who establish our RoE (Rules of Engagement) and reality and the price paid by the warfighter because of this profound disconnect.  Once again, great read.
B0000636NQ|5.0|This is one band I can listen to forever.  Alvin Lee let's loose through out this recording.  All the popular tunes.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|I loved this movie.  The acting was amazing by all the major characters.  It is smart and funny throughout, and downright hilarious in many places!  I highly recommend it.
B00001OH7O|5.0|This song is a harbinger to the End of rock and a rise in self indulgence.  The Finest In Rock and Roll.
B007MDB71O|5.0|Disney did a great job  producing this classic only to ignore it almost completely when it came time to promote it. This series inspired much of our science fiction from Buck Rogers to Star Wars to Avatar.
B000002TQV|5.0|I really enjoy this release a lot.  I saw Radiohead in the early '00's.  And that's when I really began to appreciate them.  Good Stuff!
B008O037RG|5.0|This band is a fairly great band. Their tunes are catchy and unique to them. Having this album on a record is just icing on the cake. There is no better sound quality than that of a record
B000002KNY|5.0|I love the Talking Heads.  i can remember when they first came on the scene, they really broke out quick.  This is a sample of their best.
B0040I09RM|5.0|My best friend and I are re-watching Seasons 1-5 in anticipation of Season 6 coming in September.  This is our second time watching, and each episode is as interesting as the first viewing.  Not for those who don't like violence or have children.  Somehow the violence doesn't seem offensive as it supports excellent writing with character development and plot twists.  As for the Jax-vs-Opie debate, my friend's all Jax while I'm into Opie.  And we're old broads; if we can get behind this biker show, anyone could get hooked.
B000024D4R|5.0|Pink Floyd buried rock and roll with this album.  It was the last of an era.  Lots of good material.  Very Spooky, Listen With Caution.
B004XISI4A|3.0|Better than a feast of crows but that wouldnt be too hard.AFOC and this book could have been,as i believe they were meant to be,one book.alot of book 4 wondering around aimlessly could have been cut out.I prefered this book to the previous one as it dealt with characters that i liked but the major plot points could have been combined into one book.<br />As is usual with GRRM books he enjoys nothing more than killing major characters but I felt the choices he made in the characters hat died was wrong.both Bran and Arya's stories are so boring i would have no problem skipping there chapters in future books.more interesting characters have been sacrificed yet them and there boring storyline presist?<br />While the first 3 books are undoubtedly the best (with book 3 been the pick) this & the previous book have stumbled & stuttered along,like GRRM purposely wanted to drang out the series for another few books.I just hope he up's his game for the final two books otherwise this will be a series that would have remained better as a trilogy.heres hoping....
B000007638|5.0|I remember when Over America came out in '75, blew me away.  I love this album, lots and lots of good material.
B006LXQID8|5.0|Watched this movie while on the treadmill so the sub titles took a bit to get used to.  The storyline was adorable!
B000002IAZ|5.0|Buffalo Springfield,the premier supergroup of the mid 60's.  Pre CSN&Y, but an excellent contribution.  Can't do any better than Stills and Young.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This book makes me proud to be an Amercian.  Brought tears of joy.  And prayers for the sacrifice these men and families have made
B000002U8G|5.0|Pink Floyd after they broke out.  I have this in the deck in my car right now.  I could listen to Floyd forever and this is one of my faves.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The show is fantastic, and better yet Season 3 was not available OnDemand on my television, but I was able to watch it for free through my Amazon Prime Membership!
B00028U6B8|5.0|One of the darker bands of the 70's, this is one of their darker releases.  Good Shepard is a heartening song though.  A real good listen.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome game!  So realistic! Love that you are able to easily earn gems.  I recommend this game to adults and children alike.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Not what I expected, but enjoyable. Story was different but well written. Gaiman is always worth reading, and offers a different approach each time.
B00DGKQF2S|5.0|Been waiting a very long time for a combination of talent in a minimalist setting like this.  The musical talent in this group is off the charts and it shows in top form, moving hard rock and soulful ballads.  The perfect combination of experience, imagination and drive.  Like other great trios such as Rush and Cream, the band has an amazing ability to transcend limitations and present a layered sound that defies the fact that there are a limited number of muscians involved.  Too much fine sound to be believed.  Here's to The Winery Dogs, long may they run!
B00785P2QC|4.0|This is a fun and addicting game. I love the many fulfilling goals that have you continuing. Love their other games too
B001TCHDPS|5.0|I watched the movie &#34;Searching for Sugarman&#34; and was immediately on Amazon purchasing the albums.  There are two originals and one compilation from the movie.  What an amazing story and music.  You have to watch the DVD.
B003V1WXKU|3.0|I guess I'm a bit squeamish and old fashioned. The guy is obviously brilliant and querkish. He behaved as an adolescent gawking teenage boy too much for my liking. Reading time is precious. I'd have taken a pass if I knew better
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I could not put this book down once started.  The characters became so dear and I could hardly wait to see what happened.  I was a little disappointed at the ending when the brother failed to recognize his sister -- after all he had gone through for her.
0307949486|4.0|This thriller binds together an interesting plot with the author's, obviously, wider views about familly-controlled bussiness empires. I enjoyed seemingly incongruous parallel passages about Swedish prision system, a description of typical Swedish cabin, tracing one's Bernadotte origins and a short introduction to Swedish literature from the late fifties and early sixties. On the other hand, from other passages one gets an impression that only social-democrats are capable of an act of true compassion and nobody, but those with the Nazi career, found themselves fighting in the Finnish trenches during the Winter War.<br /><br />Don't be mislead by the title - the book is basically a closed circle mystery about a rich Swedish family, which has its black sheep and decade-long secrets. First hundred pages are to introduce the main characters. The action starts somewhat late in the book and compare to its total length it is relatively short. The secrets of the family aren't too murky if one notices the prefaces before every chapter. If you enjoy the stories about wunderkinds, then you will be exhilarated about the artistic revenge of the girl with the dragon tattoo, but I think, will hardly be persuaded as to why she has to be a good hacker.<br /><br />In short, according to Larsson swedes definitely are not tea drinkers, but to read this book you certainly will not need to have as many coffees as its protagonists.
B008JFUPFI|1.0|I hate this movie. It's like picking up a Superman comic fresh from the store, and being forced to read Superman's beginnings all over again, with different artists & illustrations.<br />How much more is the typical home audience forced to endure another bit of Smallville & Clarks meeting of Lois Lane?<br />At least the George Reeves television series had a beginning and moved on to many adventures. Christopher Reeve tried, but was met with lame villains & situations. Brandon did fairly well, it showed promise, but Brandon bailed out. His bad. Kirk Alyn was before my time, but his serial still moved on in spite of amateur special effects. My suggestion to Hollywood is to read the Superman encylopedia, & gain some new insight as to Superman universe, a showdown between him & Bizarro would be most welcome. Anything but the continuation of Jor-El's plight at having to let go a son, and seeing so having to see him off into the new world.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|great puzzle game.  if you love puzzles this game is for you multiple types and gets very challenging definitely recommend this
B008602KQI|5.0|I could have done with a little less camera shake, but it was pretty true to the book!  I'd recommend it...
1452126577|5.0|I love it. It's hard not to be grumpy when going through this book. Grumpy Cat let's us in on her life, the things that make her grumpy and gives us advice on how to stay grumpy. For those expecting more activities and something, you obviously don't know Grumpy Cat. Games have winners, their are no winners in the real world, just losers. Thanks for keeping it real GC. Love.
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|i like this game is so I'm gonna be brutily honest with u it so fake and unrealistic that's what makes it fun!!!
B009QD0MYQ|5.0|Essentially a mix of melodic death metal and power metal with heavy pop elements and a soaring, clean female vocals usually found only in symphonic metal. Highly recommended to metal fans of anything from In Flames to Blind Guardian.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|It was an amazing story - so raw, real and honest, as well as comprehensive.  Loved it and will see their concert.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Great book! Kept me captivated the whole time! Really couldn't put it down....such a great weaving story that  had characters with depth and spirit. Cheers to Hosseini you have done it again!
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|Nice graphics. Fun puzzles. So far, the puzzles are easy, but it seems to be ramping up nicely.  I would recommend it especially as the FAOTD.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|There is a natural progression to the Pendergast novels that I would recommend new readers to follow. Most of these books refer - even slightly - to previous encounters and as such reading in order is a bonus. That said, it's not essential, but in the case of a Trilogy I feel it should be adhered to. This book has all the ups and downs you would expect of Pendergast and a few curved balls thrown in for good measure. I do recommend this book.
B00D6SBOWG|1.0|Downloaded twice and this app never did work. All I ever saw was the title screen before it force closed.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|ABSOLUTLEY HORROBLE SINCE UPGRADE!  There are ads all over the place.  Really need to rethink their upgrade and quickly.  I should not have to look under the rhinos ass (another ad) to find the current temp.  And some genious thought it would be awesome to play a game also.  It's the weather!!  Deleting it immediately. &#34;
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|Very simply this is the best Queens record since Nick left the band.  It is catchier and more melodic.  It's like Queens of the Stone Age meets Radiohead as there is a definite early-Radiohead vibe to the record.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B002NZK5TG|5.0|Feed Me!<br />Hey, it's Rick Moranis, Bill Murray, et el.<br />Musical adapted to movie - very entertaining!!<br />Good for kids yes? hahaha!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Can you escape is crazy. I love this game! Been ignoring everybody because I can't put it down! Can't get enough! It gets to be pretty tricky but can be figured out. The levels definitely continue to go up in difficulty.
B00008OE4W|5.0|Classic<br />Classic<br />Classic<br />The technology may be old.  The actors may be old. but hey, it's like saying The Beach Boys can't rock ... This one ROCKS
B000MRAAJM|5.0|The cinematography in all these discs is stunning and extremely professional.  My family never tires of it. I highly recommend it. You won't be sorry.
B003YUC9JI|5.0|Hey, it's got Jackie Chan in it.  What else do you want for a kung fu movie?  It is inspiring, and it takes a swipe at the original with Pat Morita (bless him and Mr Myagi) - great if you are the original The Karate Kid fan.  This one tops it like nothing could, yet stays with the intention and theme of the original The Karate Kid... only this one is BETTER.  Get the Blu-Ray to see the deleted scenes and alternate ending where Jackie Chan FIGHTS ... That scene itself is CLASSIC Jackie Chan.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|I started out loving the show even though I had to hide my eyes during the gory scenes (and there are LOTS) of them. But when many of the most interesting characters died, I just couldn't watch anymore. It became a downer for me, as if there were no hope for anyone. Ever.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Mixing history with fiction in a perfect manner. I forgot how hard it was to put a book by Mr.King down.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|This is the best comedy on television. No matter how dark my mood, one episode of BBT will usually get me to laugh. Several times!
B00ANVX6DY|3.0|My granddaughter is 1.5 years and this was a little too involved to keep her interest.  My 3 year old grandson watched it all the way through.  I found it to be too much like other movies.  Did have a nice story for couples who are joining multiple families - dealing with step sisters and step brothers.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|[Spoiler Alert]<br /><br />Honestly, I was pissed about the ending. At least E. L. James knew when to stop and left us with a great ending.<br />Nathan's case just seems so damn ridiculous especially with the added on details that definitely came out of nowhere. It could just have ended with Gideon and Eva living together and in love (after massive therapy of course). I can't believe my own imagination would be better than, what is now, NOT the last of this story. I waited forever for this to finally be released and now, I'm waiting forever, again, to read how they finally get their happily ever after.<br /><br />Regardless, she kept the characters the same and showed us that Gideon and Eva can make it and Cary finally stopped being so promiscuous. All the other characters just seem lost though.... Oh well, here's to the next book! *cheers*
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I'm using it with an Airport Express and everything just worked automatically.  Youtube, Netflix, Amazon, etc. Tried it with an iPhone, iPad, MacBook Pro.
B00138F0MQ|5.0|One of the best albums of all time. Brings back great memories. A must to buy. Don't hesitate to pick it up.
B004YW4L5K|2.0|I have always held the author, Neil Gaiman, in high esteem. He remains one of the few writers who can magically change reality into fantasy and fantasy back into reality while the reader sits in a spellbound position. I have read most of his books and would advise an avid reader to follow my lead and do the same. See my other book reviews.<br /><br />I was not only shocked by this, the antithesis of his other works, but the number of readers who felt this is one of their 'top 10' books they have ever read! Maybe the latter shows how unskilled the public has become at adept reader analysis and, furthermore, that they should refrain from other comments outside of evaluating Marvel Comics and the color of Superman's cape.<br /><br />Neil Gaimon in this writing incident did one of a variety of things. He may have hired an editor who was driven by his need to have the writer's approval rather than aiding in making the story a more readable text for the consumer. Or the author may have simply found himself caught up in all the previous accolades of earlier writings that he forgot what got him there. Or the author may have simply gotten lazy! His characters are flat and are mere shadow figures rather than identifiable beings, his story is muddled giving the appearance that he was 'making it up as he went along' and his plot line was never well defined. Are these characters dead, still alive or in between? Are these characters gods or humans? Which ones of these numerous gods are we supposed to affix in our memory banks that will be brought back before the conclusion occurs? We are never sure of any of these answers even after we have turned the last page.<br /><br />The author did, however, preform the the much desired whodunit trick. At the end, he drew together previous characters into a surprising ending. He did so, however, without ever clearly defining them in the first place! So when we reach the conclusion we are required to go back to earlier chapters to recollect who these characters are! Neil, because I have applauded 'Neverworld', 'The Graveyard Book' and 'Stardust' I feel that I have the equal right to issue my displeasure over your explosion in a Word Factory which you called 'American Gods'.who these characters are! Neil, because I have applauded 'Neverworld', 'The Graveyard Book' and 'Stardust' I feel that I have the equal right to issue my displeasure over your explosion in a Word Factory which you called 'American Gods'.

B00CP9SRMW|4.0|It is another classic by Jane Austen that all young people need to read.  It is just as good, if not better than Pride and Prejudice.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The quality was amazing!! We enjoyed the show and the stream quality was awesome. No buffering!! :) thanks amazon! I highly recommend this service!! Definitely worth amazon prime!! Loved this show too! Can't wait for season 4!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I very much enjoy playing this game for it requires some thought but still is easy enough to have a great expirience. Highly recommend.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great series  Haven't completed all of the episodes, but certainly enjoying it, I'm surprised how well it was written and characters casted for each part.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|This is an awesome series. My Hubby and I stayed up late several nights because we needed to see what was going to happen next. I can not believe it is in it's last season. Why? Oh why, are you stopping a good thing.
B00CO52NLI|5.0|For my granddaughter's new kindle.  She loves animals and seem to really like this video.  Would recommend to young people.
1401324649|5.0|A clever book. Filled with dark humour and wit. I read it in just a few days as I couldn't put it down.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Not to be confused with the simplistic Hollywood movie (although not completely terrible). This is a very thought provoking and realistic take on what would happen to the world during and after the zombie apocalypse.
1616551607|5.0|[[VIDEOID:moX2P7CNL8ARDP]]In 2012, Dark Horse released the first edition of The Sky limited to 1000 copies. Many who pre-ordered were left sorely disappointed when their books did not ship when the shipping date went by. 1000 limited copies for fans of Final Fantasy, a game series that has over millions of fans. Now that's truly limited.<br /><br />Well, it's all good now. Dark Horse has released, this time, a non-limited edition of The Sky that is more easily available. Although there are no additional goodies with this release.<br /><br />This is a slipcase set with three hardcover books. The cardboard slipcase is covered with some silky fabric with a beautiful print across and to the back. It's very sturdy cardboard and even has a cover for the opening. The presentation is very nice.<br /><br />Inside the book there are the three large format artbooks. Volume 1 collects works for FF I-III, Volume 2 for FF IV-VI and 3 for FF VII-X. This is a collection of artworks from 1987 to 2001. Altogether, there are 576 pages.<br /><br />This box set might not be what you're expecting depending on the type of FF fan you are.<br /><br />I suspect there might be a group of fans or designers looking for art that is closer to the games. You know, like those art-of books typically released alongside games? The Sky is not like those artbooks. There's no full list of characters or enemies, environment art (I'm still looking for these), weapons, vehicles or promotional art.<br /><br />The focus in on character designer Yoshitaka Amano and his character designs. There are over hundreds of drawings of characters and enemies in the unique Amano style of art.<br /><br />It really interesting to see, for the first few games, how those dot matrix game sprites are translated into or from the concept art. If you've not played the games, these designs will appear foreign. Even if you've played the games, they might still appear foreign because they can be wildly different from their video game form. Therein lies the brilliance of Amano, who can create such a huge cast of characters for the FF world.<br /><br />The amount of content for each game varies. Book 2 is the thickest so you get a bulk of work from FF IV to VI. Book 3 is quite thin with only ten pages for FFVII. Much is of Cloud and Aeris, with occasional appearance of Sephiroth and RedXIII.<br /><br />Not all characters or enemies drawn are labeled. It's a challenge to identify them sometimes.<br /><br />Depending on where you buy it from, there might be additional weight surcharge. This box set is heavy. It ships with its own custom sized cardboard shipping box designed to prevent damage. That's the way to do it for an exquisite set.<br /><br />You might know that there was an earlier book called [[ASIN:1593078684 Dawn: The Worlds of Final Fantasy]]. Much of that book's content is duplicated here so there's no reason to get that book anymore.<br /><br />Ultimately, this boxset represents great value for money. Grab it fast if you like the art.<br /><br />(See more pictures of the book on my blog. Just visit my Amazon profile for the link.)e form.

140006922X|5.0|As a Muslim I strong disagree with Dr. Aslan's assessment of Jesus crucify and birth. If you just look at history surely you will find that Jesus was crucified that is because \\"... [another] was made to resemble him to them...\\"<br /><br />And [for] their saying, \\"Indeed, we have killed the Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, the messenger of Allah .\\" And they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him; but [another] was made to resemble him to them. And indeed, those who differ over it are in doubt about it. They have no knowledge of it except the following of assumption. And they did not kill him, for certain. -- Quran 4:157<br /><br />Thus, this is not matter of fact but matter of believe.<br /><br />Second, he questions the virgin birth of Jesus. Again I can't prove that he was born of virgin Marry rather I believe, and I take it as a miracle. People who don't believe in miracles surely will have hard time believing so.<br /><br />And the reason for 5 star is to counter all the 1 star fox news viewers .
B008BU75IQ|3.0|Apparently there will be a 4th book. Just as he left us dangling in the 2nd volume, he ends this with another cliff hanger.  Cliff hangers are all well and good and can be exciting but Archer carries these too far in the preceding book so that it takes less than a page to describe the outcome. It seems as though his cliff hangers are merely tactics to get you to buy the next book. This isn't necessary and cheapens the book, for he is an excellent writer and only needs to hint at the coming events. Not sure I will buy the next book in this series. Otherwise this book keeps you interested in the new events that occur;
B00785P2QC|4.0|Thank you reminds  me of sim city I loved playing that game so much thank you having fun playing and I'm done now
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I'll make this short and sweet. I'm not here to leave any detailed tech information, as there are tons of sites already doing that.<br /><br />First, the price. Amazing. Yes, I was one of the early ones, so I did get a Netflix code for 3 months free; but I believe since I am also a new customer, I have a one month free trial, which could potentially give me up to 4 months of free Netflix! In terms of value alone, I'm getting a $32 deal with Netflix, which means for the device itself I paid $3. Even without the promotion, $35 is a bargain for what this product could potentially do.<br /><br />Second, the actual product. I would say I am a bit on the tech-geek side, so setting up was a breeze. Plug, connect, and play. It's that simple. I used my S4 to connect the device to my home WiFi network (FiOS). YouTube and Play Music have been seamless thus far, no lag for me. My WiFi is pretty strong, though it's not anything comparable to 100Mbps speed or Google Fiber. If your WiFi is better than mine, there should rarely be any lag or stutter.<br /><br />It's already been discussed that the cons include the lack of apps compatible for now. Chrome tab-casting has mixed results and is, technically, in beta stage at the moment. But if this is the beginning, then I have to say I'm excited in the coming weeks and months. Already apps are being tested, so patience is key.<br /><br />I'm sure there are more detailed and thoughtful reviews than mine, but I thought I'd leave my review on this immensely popular device. For such a cheap price, there can't be enough hype. I hope the people who leave the negative reviews understand that, or perhaps should have read more carefully on what this product can actually do. It can't be compared to a Roku or Apple TV, because it's not the same. Sometimes different is good for the competition, for the evolution of the product.
6304806434|3.0|From the Jerry Bruckheimer camp of blow things up and ask questions later, this film about a planeful of convicts and one former army ranger on his way home after serving time is a goofy and preposterous film. It pretty much begins the downfall of Nicolas Cage, which we can characterize by his getting weirder hairpieces in each film. Cage mumbles his way through the film, staying on this flight of lunatics after they take over the plane. John Cusack is good as a marshal trying to regain control of the situation from the ground, Colm Meaney is delightfully cranky as a federal agent having a bad day, and it's really John Malkovich who makes the film, playing the villain to the hilt and chewing the scenery.

B00A8MGIZG|3.0|We spend too much time trying to get all the details and not getting involved in the story. Then when the moral in the end is not that clear clear or moving, we try to go back to the main couple, only to discover that what was missing was the chemistry. Tom Hanks is worth it, as usual.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I REALLY LIKE THE WEATHER CHANNEL APP BECAUSE I CAN GO THERE AND CHECK OUT THE WEATHER ANY TIME I NEED TOO!
B00009RAJH|5.0|This has great sound quality. Mixed to perfection. I used to think Christine McVie could not carry a tune; I was wrong. Love this &#34;anthem album&#34; even more now. Has always been one of my standards.
B007I2BYX0|5.0|I highly recommend this to anyone who like good heavy rock with a female lead singer. Very hypnotic vocals on this cd.
B008LC8TJI|3.0|There are a couple of good catchy tunes--typical Maroon 5 sound--on this album. The rest is just club dance pop tht any band could do.
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|My daughter and I adore this app. I'm giving it three stars because of how expensive the pets are that cost bling(which is real money). It is the most ridiculous and pointless part of the game. No virtual pet should cost $100 real dollars. It's insane. I would spend some money here and there for an app but that much for on one pet or house. If I bought every bling item I would be spending close to $10,000, like wth! The poor children who don't understand, it as if they are doing it on purpose. Get your act together.

B006VP1OYO|5.0|Before purchasing this compilation, I had a few of the My Bloody Valentine EPs, so I was aware that the EPs contained some very strong tracks that were hidden gems. I also love the band so much that I was willing to take a chance on a record with mostly unknown material.<br /><br />Quite simply, I now love this album almost as much as Loveless. It's obviously not as polished and focused, but it meanders and drives forward at such a lovely pace, with a wonderfully eclectic mix of tracks from the time leading up to and during Loveless' release. It captures all of the achingly beautiful softly deafening soundscapes that one would expect from My Bloody Valentine, and is an enchanting sonic journey that manages to stay familiar and yet unexpectedly diverse throughout the two discs. I had the CDs in my rotation for I don't even know how long and never once got tired of listening to them. There was always something catching my ear, and I finally had to force myself to switch the album out with something new for fear that I might burn myself out on listening to it. But thinking about it now, I don't know if burning out on this compilation is even possible.<br /><br />This release showcases everything that makes My Bloody Valentine so special and mesmerizing. I can't recommend it highly enough to both fans and people curious about exploring My Bloody Valentine for the first time. A simply wonderful album.

B00CF34B2I|5.0|No Sorin Markov deck? That one was always my favorite!!! I hope they add it in later or something. Even without the hunky Sorin Markov the game is still lots of fun.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun and engaging, little too costly on the premium items. Graphics are nice but not stunning, I've seen better. Animations are fluid for the most part.
B008MVPHNE|5.0|Not only are these the most comfortable Crocs made, but yellow and grape is the best color combination. The price was also right, thanks Amazon!
B005TBN3EU|3.0|not as good as the first nor should it be.<br />what a worthless concept to place a franchaise on.<br />hopeless
B0065GC0BA|5.0|This novel stayed with me, long after I had finished it. It really moved me. It brings together two people and their stories: Will, a handsome, bigger than life, successful Londoner whose life completely changes when an accident leaves him in a wheelchair and needing full-time care; and Lou, a quirky, sweet young woman whose life has also been profoundly shaped by an event in her youth that she can't quite let go of. They meet when Lou is hired to care for Will, and almost instantly dislike each other, but as time passes their friendship begins and grows as they discover they are not as different as they initially thought. In one another they find a way to heal some of the hurts that have changed them, and find new ways to look at themselves and their lives. This is the kind of novel that gets under your skin and into your heart, and you can't put it down until you have reached the end, and even then you want there to be more of the story to read. But in some ways it's not an easy read because Jojo Moyes doesn't write an easy breezy ending, or leave us with everything sewn up neatly, so it was also a little wrenching. I would highly recommend it, though.
0061906220|5.0|Wonderful story helps teach colors. Catchy tune for the students to learn and sing well after the story is over.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Look, I don't care one way or the other about what people believe about Jesus.  But I sure do like seeing history come alive.  Aslan is a great author, and he transports the reader to ancient Jerusalem like no one else I have read.
B002QQ8HAG|5.0|Most people don't realize how much their visual creates their 'brand' (i.e.- others' perception of who they are and what they stand for).<br /><br />This movie finally shows fashion for the intellectual endeavor that it really is and people can also see how the game is typically rigged!

1455527475|3.0|I liked this book - but dislike the author. Many Wall Streeters have written about what it was like when the economy imploded in 2008 and 2009, and I like the inside<br />tales of gloom and doom. The author does well in taking us to and through this period from a mid-level guy at Goldman Sachs. But like so many authors, this one can't restrain himself from making himself the hero of the story. The only honest guy on Wall Street. It became too much for me, and I soon tired of his story.<br /><br />Yes, successful people on Wall Street can and do make a huge amount of money, but they don't save a life or build something that survives them. By his own admission, this guy was 1 of 1000 VPs at Goldman Sachs. 1 of 1000!! The owner of his own grocery store is more important and has more control over his business life. And that grocer would never demean his colleagues in print the way this author did his. Classless.<br /><br />Finally, there is the matter of our author's religion. He tells us many times throughout the book that he is Jewish, but what he is really saying is that he feels guilty about the fact that he doesn't live a Jewish life. Who but the most marginal Jew has to consider whether to go to work or temple for the Jewish High Holy Days?<br />And with a name like Greg Smith, I'm sure he's passed as something else for much of his adult life. But when one thinks of himself as God-like, who has the need for the real thing?<br /><br />An afterthought should Greg read this: You left and your place was immediately taken by someone else. GS didn't skip a beat or lose a cent from your departure.<br />It's as if you were never there.
B009369Z8A|5.0|I can't stop watching this movie!! I love that it is based on a historical account and the acting is top notch! Its a really great movie...you won't be disappointed!
B004MYFV0O|5.0|I wanted to learn how to draw but I had my doubts about my abilities. I have M.S. and tremors in my hands. I bought this book due to all the good reviews. Well here is another one. I am 1/4 of the way through this book and I found it hard to believe I can DRAW!!<br />Sure I'm no artist (yet) but the improvement I have had from when I first started this book is amazing. If your like me and have trouble even drawing stick figures, get this book.You won't be disappointed.
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|This is a great game that is like a puzzle. You have to use the tools given to make your ball match the one on the box. I like that it takes some playing around to figure out how things affect it, and some of the levels are a bit challenging, however I wish there were more levels! I got through all the levels in less than an hour, and there is very little re-play value. For the FAOTD it was great, but I wouldn't pay for it without more levels.  I really enjoyed it while it lasted, but just wish it lasted a bit longer. Maybe for a pre-teen or high school student (would be too challenging for most younger kids).
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|This book is a must read for any one with a brain.  Clear thinking about how we fool ourselves into thinking about religion.
B002N8TJ18|4.0|Love this for background music or just to plain relax. Had it once and lost it and was glad to get it again.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I'm still reading it.<br />The narrator jumps from person to person.<br />When it seemed that the story must be over another person jumps in and extends it.
B00632HWOG|3.0|When I get on the computer the e-mails I deleted seem to still be there.  I think.  I may be wrong.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Nice read. good content, although I thought it came together in the end too quickly. I really liked the characters.
B00COMLLX2|5.0|Just like a real pinball machine! Lots of noise,. Lots of lights. Lots of action!And, wait for it....Lots of fun!
140006922X|5.0|The viral Fox interview features Aslan going over and over his unimpeachable academic credentials as a religious historian. And it seems this is simply false.<br /><br />[...] Link deleted, for some reason, but a spirited discussion of said credendials (or lack of) is available over at the First Things website, in several separate posts in the \\"First Thoughts\\" blog section.<br /><br />5 stars for chutzpa.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|Very much enjoyed his  first two books.  Although I found this story interesting, culture wise, I also found the it quite confusing.  Keeping the characters straight was a real effort.

B0016BP0PW|5.0|Every American born between 1950 and 1958 should see this film.  The incorporation of the story into the words of the songs is incredible.
B001E75QH0|1.0|Bought this boxed set as a birthday gift.  When we got around to watching these movies, The Last Crusade was so severely scratched it was unwatchable.  Naturally, we were past the return window by 1 week.  And Amazon makes it impossible to return/replace items.  Frustrated.  This item was new, in-box.  There is no reason why it should be scratched.
034580404X|4.0|It was ok for my girlfriend, she read all the 3 books, she liked it.<br /><br />The shipment and everything was oK !
0439023521|5.0|This book was fantastic, to say I could't put it down is an understatement, it had me at hello!! From the first page you're there. The Autors writing style is mesmerizing. Wonderful entertaining book

B004UG7RQ0|5.0|I use it with the Bose SoundDock Series I.  It adds the &#34;AUX&#34; input Bose left out until Series II.
B007ZXK08C|2.0|Started off well, dragged, and then disappointed. I was expecting a more exciting ending and in parts found I really struggled to keep reading. I liked the narrative - was different, but both a friend and I agreed it was a flat ending.
B00DHNBPA6|2.0|I still stick to the original,I dint get the story in this one,but it was so so,but I wound recomend it,see the original instead.
B007MDB71O|4.0|I don't know what Disney hoped to achieve by not promoting this fun movie, but I believe they really missed the mark. There was a lot here that could have made Disney a lot of money in the long run, but they weren't concerned with it. It's like they wanted it to fail.<br />This movie is a gripping story of one man's journey to Barsoom (Mars), where he becomes a slave, then a soldier, falls in love, and is given the opportunity to rule the empire. This movie was gripping, funny, moving, and extremely well done.<br />Back when I was a kid, Disney would have jumped at the chance to throw all of their money behind the advertising, and it would have done well. I remember seeing the first trailers for this movie, and having no idea what it was about because of the title, because it looked like a futuristic story taking place on another planet, etc. What they should have explained was that this story jump started sci-fi for all the greats: Star Wars, Star Trek, etc. Disney did a great disservice to their audience, and to Edgar Rice Burroughs, who really is the grandfather of all sci-fi.<br />What people don't realize is that \\"John Carter\\" made back all of its money, just not in America. It is a great movie that too many people were afraid to see because no one knew about it. To this day, I have trouble explaining how awesome this movie is because of the poor marketing. This is a travesty! This is unacceptable! Disney needs to get it together!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|good movie, lots of action. would have been a good movie to see in the theater but very good at home as well. Lots of big names and some laughs.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I could not put this novel down.  As I read it I kept trying to decide what would I do.  Did not see the ending coming!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Such an interesting twist on what life was like during that time period.  Really enjoyed this novel and did not want it to end.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This novel was well written.  I did not want the story to end.  The ending I did not see it coming.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Easily the best show I have ever seen. Its a can't get enough, hilarious, and amazingly detailed series that would be a tragedy to miss.
B00012FXB8|3.0|Predictable with a depressing air about it, and too many heavy lines full of foreboding and drama.  And yet still watchable until the very end, with what I consider a hysterical ending (though it wasn't meant to draw laughter).
B001NLL93W|5.0|I loved it and proud that it tackled difficult subjects. I read the next three and I can't wait for the movie. I definitely reccomend reading the book first!
B001NLKXK2|5.0|This book does a great job of making dementia understood through the mind of a person losing hers.  It is as frightening as it is moving - but I worry now every time I cannot remember a word I mean to use.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I expected this to be great because I have read Hosseini's other books and loved them.  Unfortunately, this book meanders into too many tangential stories and they are never tied together in any meaningful way so the power of the book is lost.  It starts off very strongly and makes you want more but never quite gets back to the impact of the characters in the beginning.
B005LW5J9O|5.0|I feel like a better educated person for having read this book.  It is a fascinating history, which pulls together so much knowledge from antiquities through modern times.  It takes your breath away.
B00BBQXUYK|5.0|A great movie. My kids LOVE it!! I think its darling. Very good to watch as a family. It's not just a Christmas movie! it's for anyone who believes in Santa, The Easter Bunny, The Tooth Fairy...it's really good.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This movie kept a high level of hope all the way through it. I'm glad they all made it alive.
B005544TRQ|4.0|Although I really like this show, some of the mistakes they make from a legal standpoint detract from the credibility.  If you can suspend your disbelief and don't have a well-developed knowledge of law and legal systems, this snarky comedy is a great choice
B007MDB71O|5.0|This is a great interesting, family movie, with lots of action, excellent actors, great plot and amazing visual effects I wish they make a sequence because it's a lot of entertainment for the whole family. We really enjoy it!!
B004EPYZQC|5.0|This movie was awesome. I saw it twice in theaters and couldnt wait to own my own copy. this movie has heart racing adrenaline, fast cars, wonderful plot and some exciting twists and turns that you wouldnt expect.
B005LAJ212|5.0|Its in the title. Its well written and very well planned. A must see buy and own...it doesnt get any better than this.
B0006212Q8|5.0|I have seen the video for Black & White Night and it is a great video.  Roy Orbison was one of the greatest musicians of all time and just to listen to this CD is so relaxing and enjoyable.  Thank you for having a great product.

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|They balanced the difficulty aspect perfect to where you won't find yourself getting frustrated but pleasantly stumped and perplexed. Definitely looking forward to further rooms.
B007IK44CK|3.0|I hate tom cruise. Should have been better action. Decent though all in all. The usual Mission Impossible. Oh well.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love the app for The Weather Channel. And now with the new version,you can earn points to get rewards. You can choose from a lot of gift cards,or donate to a good cause. Really easy to use.
B004BJMEO6|3.0|I agree with one reviewer: the director seems to so distrust the innate smarts of her audience she has to hammer everything over and over. Of course, I enjoyed watching Necar Zadegan -- she is a stunner and has a lovely accent. Her unusual looks and talents remain under-used. The cons are: the film is lacking in nuance. It ostensibly celebrates women but women are shown not as intelligent as they really are. In reality, women are walking supercomputers. They are capable of detecting love interest and distinguish the straight from lesbian ones in a matter of milliseconds. How long do you think it will take a woman to spot a lesbian interest projected on her? An instance. Yet, Necar is asking Traci -- after they hang out for a while -- what she meant by the phrase she \\"had lived with a partner\\".  After Traci admits she is lesbian, Necar proceeds to reassure Tracy that she is a friend of lesbians because she voted the right way.  Not only she is not shown terribly bright, she begins complying with Traci right away. This means that Traci had Necar \\"at hello\\", which doesn't make for an interesting romance, straight or lesbian. Where is the give-and-take? In end the film is a predictable vanilla soap. Women deserve better. Still, worth watching if only because of Necar Zadegan.
B00DHNJGCU|4.0|Colin Farrell is quite good and Noomi Rapace has her English down enough now that she seems natural in her role. Over-all it's good shoot 'em up revenge story with a little more work on the characters than one usually finds in this sort of film.
1400067820|4.0|\\"Though your beginning was small,<br />Yet your latter end would increase abundantly.\\" -- Job 8:7 (NKJV)<br /><br />Something that's antifragile isn't just the opposite of something that breaks easily, it's actually something that benefits from buffeting. The book's choice of its title demonstrates its biggest weakness: It takes a pretty simple concept and mostly defines it in negative terms. Antifragile would have been much more useful if it had focused on identifying many examples of such instances and discussed how to think about interacting most effectively as an individual and an organization in such environments.<br /><br />Professor Taleb comes across as someone who greatly feels that he's been treated unfairly by critics and the uninformed. Much of the book expresses such experiences and his understandably annoyed reactions to them. In that sense, there's a sense of reading a memoir in places.<br /><br />I found that the concept made sense to me and provides a useful way to express circumstances and relationships that offer great potential ... but for which I previously had no terminology to describe. Seldom have I found a book that adds to my thinking as usefully in terms of both the concept and the ways to apply it. I felt as if a major part of my brain's map of the world was sketched in for the first time.<br /><br />I was almost as greatly indebted to the many explanations of why optimizations are bad, due to increasing fragility ... so that when variability inevitably occurs the negative consequences will be increased.<br /><br />I also appreciated the careful way that resiliency and antifragility were distinguished from one another.<br /><br />Very nice ... but please, Professor Taleb, make your next book less of a diatribe against those who don't understand you for those of us who like your ideas.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|This was a lovely, up to date, interesting story with depth and humor.  I was attracted by the catchy title but pleased with the story that followed!  It was a great read!
0425267695|5.0|Incredible book. I've read every fantasy book by all of the great authors such as Erikson, Sanderson, etc and the writing in this book is on par with them at least.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|This was a good book.  I liked it.  It was interesting and kept my attention till the end. I hope the author has more books!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|The show is great, with interesting story lines and plot twists.  Amazon streaming makes it easy to watch any time.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|I can understand why Peter Jackson put off this project for so long. It has been a jinxed story to film thus far in the history of movie making. This is the best movie Hobbit by far. But, Peter, please, the scenes with Radagast were unbearable. You can do better.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|All of this series are my favorite books.  I've read them about six times and continue to enjoy them with each reading.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|really like this film. imaginative, weird, funny, tragic. I loved Pi's adult character as well as the boy on the boat. Beautiful film.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Just bought it after watching unbelieveable stupid and embarrassing Fox News interviewer while interviewing with the author.<br />This triggered my curiousity about the book.<br /><br />I just skimmed it.  The book is easy to learn for this kind of scholarly written masterpiece by an expert in religion.  There are 15 chapters divided into three parts.<br /><br />Most all of the one-star comments are fake as the those who gave comment have not read the book.  Despite the fact that the author is a muslim, he is also an authoritative in the knowledge of bible, graduated from Harvard University's Devinity school and Ph.D in religions from UC Santa Barbara.  On top of that, he has been professor of religion for about 20 years.<br /><br />This book doesn't quote or cite any muslim references (I scanned the bibliography, none of them of islamic references), yet Islamophobia has blinded people with accusation of biases, made it worse before reading it.<br /><br />Good thing Amazon has the sign to show if the person actually bought the book.<br /><br />Don't listen to people who don't own or read the book.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|I can see why this film got an Academy award. Interesting throughout, suspenseful, and great performances. I will watch it again.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Great performances by everybody in the film. I'd seen it when it came out in 2010 and watched it again for the 2013 release of Red 2.  I loved it just as much as the first time I saw it.
B008B3GP2A|5.0|Love just about every song on this album. They are masters at  piquing emotions and rocking a beat! Just awesome!
B000FC1MCS|3.0|I don't know whether or not I like this book or not. It is very confusing at some points and the main character has lots of problems. If you're into that, this is the book for you.
0553328255|5.0|Amazon does not allow user photos for this product, so I will try to explain it here.<br /><br />The \\"Mass Market Paperback\\" version is a two volume set with all four novels and all 56 short stories.  This is a reissue from Bantam, Copyright 2003.  The typeface of these two volumes is also normal paperback size and not the tiny print like in many of the older published versions. Volume I is 1059 pages, not including the Introduction, which is 18 pages.  Volume II is 737 pages, not including the intro, which is the same 18 page introduction that is in Volume I.  Both Volumes I & II are listed with a MSRP of $6.95 above their own ISBN and UPC numbers.  The paper holder that both books can go into has a different ISBN and UPC number with a MSRP of $13.90.  Thus, buying this set does give a small discount from time of this review.<br /><br />The paper holder for the two volumes has an ISBN of 978-0-553-328257<br /><br />ISBN: 0-553-21241-9<br />Volume I includes:<br />A Study in Scarlet<br />The Sign of Four<br />Adventures of Sherlock Holmes<br />Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes<br />The Return of Sherlock Holmes<br /><br />ISBN: 0-553-21242-7<br />Volume II includes:<br />The Hound of the Baskervilles<br />The Valley of Fear<br />His Last Bow<br />The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes
B0091REZMW|3.0|This is a very good short-term distraction, but begins losing its \\"shiny\\" after a few days. Looking for the same items in the same rooms becomes tiresome and the avatars constantly parading all around the map gets irksome very quickly. A few moving images is fine, but the more friends you acquire, the more snatchins appear and soon the entire screen is a mass of movement. It's a good distraction, but if I suddenly couldn't access it I wouldn't be too distraught.
B00992CF6W|5.0|(Written by my 10 year old daughter) It is the best game on my device!! You should get it people!! I think it would be ten stars. It does need something... the: Map and the Ender dragon!!!!! That would make it fifty stars for me. All the people that say it's bad... that's a shame :( Because it's awesome!!!!!! :) :) :)
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I really enjoyed playing the room it's not like all the other puzzle games it challenges you to remember and put clues together. I've went through the entire game twice and it's was challenging the second time as well.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|This work should change any mind who is skeptic about the existence of spirits and an afterlife.  It confirms what I have sensed and experienced examples of throughout my life.
030789701X|5.0|I love this book, it's a gorgeous work of art, spend the money and get this, it's a great price for 1120 pages of pure awesome. :-)
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|Better than most Hollywood movies. Some truth told that is absent from the majority of films. And quick funny for the first half.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|It gives another view of WWI with realistic characters. I especially appreciated that the language was clean and consequences of good and bad choices are portrayed.
B009GX69RK|5.0|My friend got this for me saying I would like it, and she was spot on. This show is great.
B005MYEPXC|4.0|is amazing. It's a must see. Especially if you ever believed another time period was better than the one you live in! I enjoyed it from beginning to end!
B00CLMA3HK|4.0|It took me a little while to really get into this book. I can't pinpoint the cause, but I did find myself much more engaged in the story during the second half of the book. Maybe it's because that's when we started being exposed to the other worlds, I don't know. I do know that I enjoyed the different scenes and planets created by the authors, especially Area 51 (which according to the story isn't even in Nevada). I found the characters to be well developed, the plot cracked along, and I'm looking forward to seeing what happens in the sequel. Appropriate for adults and teens, though there are some scenes that might be too violent for the middle grade crowd and lower.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really love this game its a lot of fun to play. more fun than the temple run games besause this one has boss fights. great game I love it.
B000009HF2|4.0|really only 4 or 5 goiod songs, but still worthwhile.  naturally, the talking guitar at the end remains  par excellence
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Loved THE ROOM....! I wish it was longer.... Let  my husband  do it too. He liked it also! Thank you Fireproof games.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Only bought this because I got hooked on the HBO series. Turns out, as in most cases, the book is even better. Enjoy!

B007VDN1PA|3.0|I was able to scan a few trays of slides with good speed and good results, then the scanner started not responding for a few seconds after removing a slide.  It appears the scanner works by the slide opening the lens for scanning and the preparation for the next slide setup done by the removal of the slide.  It worked great then it started acting like something was not releasing freely.<br />I am looking at some of the other available scanners and may end up trying another one of these scanners to complete my job
B0098460O4|5.0|These two have a wonderful future ahead! Very grateful they took the initiative to come forward and share their gift with us all! Took courage and lots of it!! Bravissimo!! Wishing them all the sweetest blessings and want to definitely hear more!! Wonderful!!!
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Book with tons of good ideas....DVD excellent  and we were sorry when we. Completed ...would highly recommend both...looking for season 2
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This little game will definitely put your eyes and brain to work. The puzzles get tougher as levels progress. Also ... keep in mind that some are easier than they look! Have patience ... you'll get there!<br />&ecirc;&iquest;~<br /><br />Can't wait for new levels to be released!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I love the minions.. my little 2 year old does too, so this was a no brainer download.<br /><br />It took FOREVER to download... so it's rich in visuals, but you pay for that in the download time.<br />I got some of the specialized tools-- the freeze gun for example.. but it's not very clear about how i activate that, or any other of the tools that you spend bananas to buy.<br /><br />There's a little hook that asks if you found a special room in the lab.. and It's not very clear how to explore the lab.. maybe I just need to keep playing to unlock more things.. but it seems if they are going to throw a hint out there, they should tell you what you need to do to play there.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great way to get caught up on shows I missed. Easy access and can watch at my convience. Love Amazon
B005544TRQ|5.0|Best show we have seen in a while!! We wish we didnt have to watch it live now. Cant wait for more episodes.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I read this awesome novel in one sitting. I sat in bed, started it, and didn't move til I was done. I loved everything about the book, even Travis' overbearing self. I found his character bad ass and sexy. Although I wanted to punch Abby half of the time the character development was great. This was just one book that hooked me, despite every negative review I read before purchasing! :)
B009R659L8|5.0|Great Read...but then again Mary Higgins Clark always is.<br />I always enjoy reading her stories once you start it is hard<br />to lay the book down.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|i absolutely love this game.  it promotes problem solving and logical thinking.  it's one of those rare games that i think all parents and teachers should encourage their kids to play.  the only thing that might make it even better is to have a timer or move counter so that we can replay it multiple times and still feel challenged.  this app is worth paying for.
B0086DBE62|5.0|This was a great spin on cinderella. I thought Julia roberts did a great job as the wicked stepmother. And her smile is still enlighten. Good movie.
0989524116|5.0|After reading Outview, I was anxious to get more of this series. Outin was even better than the first, maybe because I was more accustomed to the author's style or maybe because I was trying to predict the plot twists I knew were coming. The description of the places the main characters travel to were phenomenal and the fast paced nature of the story kept me reading. I am definitely excited about the next book!
B00CZAYNOC|3.0|Let me explain what I mean when I say this album is a disappointment. When this a song on this album is good, it's great, but when a song is bad, it's horrible, and to be honest, there are only about 3-4 good songs. This album runs in to the same problems that was seen in their last album, and I'll be the first to admit, they sold out. Moody's lyrics on this album are boring and dull, the songs are repetitive and cliche, and the band in general is heading in a direction that I am upset to see.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|As more and more apps support chromecast on mobile devices, this product will only get better. So far, I have not had any probloems with it and plan on getting more for all of mt tv's. Highly recommend this product.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Love the perspective and reasoning behind this novel. Will continue to read Stephen King. I have always enjoyed his writing style.
B000002KHH|5.0|Very glad to find this CD cheap on Amazon. One of the songs &#34;Rat Salad&#34;, is on Black Sabbath's current setlist for North American concerts.  Couldn't just buy the MP3 on Amazon or other sites.  So buying the CD cheaply was important to us - and we did, thanks to you!
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|I've seen this movie several times and I always get a kick out of it.  I hope TC does more.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|was not sure I would like this show but I watched all 3 seasons and really enjoyed the series. Can't wait for season 4.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|This was an odd movie.  It reminded me of reading tarot cards.  You shuffle the deck and then you get cards in a random order and you make the story out of it.
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|I kept waiting for something to happen or at least come to the point.  Did not live up to the hype.
030758836X|4.0|This is my first Gillian Flynn novel, but it won't be my last. 'Gone Girl' is a thrilling murder mystery about a dysfunctional marriage turned really, really bad. The story is narrated by the wife and the husband in alternating chapters. The wife's story is told from the past via diary entries. The Scott-Peterson-esque husband narrates his story in present day. However, I must admit, the ending was a little disappointing - I wish the author had taken a different direction. Nonetheless, this book is an engrossing page turner. If you're looking for a fast-paced, psychological thriller, you need to read this book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Notch is so awesome for making . This game it's like totally different from the other games<br />Please get this app
1781162646|4.0|I haven't read a King crime book before.  I'm a huge King fan of his typical work- but this was a nice read.  Relatively short, well structured, and no inconsistencies in characters' habitualities and such.  Yeah, I'd recommend it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The very best of TV. The story is magnificent and the characters are deep and complicated. I wish I had access to better channels but so very grateful for Prime video service.  The US major networks are pandering to the ignorant with trash TV just like they continued to promote rap even though it was not mainstream when it was introduced.  After years of brainwashing it is now popular even on auto commercials. And the scary thing is these \\"influenced\\" people now vote.
B000Q8QH0I|5.0|So many good actors in one single movie with an excellent script. You won't want to miss a second of it.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|This show has everything.  Tight fantastic writing, great stories, wonderful acting.<br />I love it.<br />The cast has created wonderful chemistry and fantastic relationships. The stories are fantastic and well told, not crossing lines between sympathetic realism and voyeurism.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|He doesn't seem to play this game a lot, so I rated it on that. It's probably just his taste preference.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun!!!I loved playing this game with my cousin!We had a great time! He taught me how to play.On my first try I was a master at this game!I'm going to tell my friends about this game!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I started playing this game on Facebook and I was extremely happy when I seen it in the app store!
B00CATSONE|5.0|I'm a very analytical person and would never consider myself creative, but this book inspired my inner imagination. It was much more than a story about Tesla, but rather a story about discovering the creative side inside of yourself.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|My son doesn't play this game that often, might not be his thing. But thought I would rate it based on how much he plays it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|me and my kids and neices love this game...it keeps 4 kids busy so I can get stuff done for at least an hour and half which is great when there are 4 kids 6 &amp; under
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|He loves anything that has to do with Angry Birds. Sure has helped me when I need to keep him occupied.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Well I agree with everyone who said the second one was more of the same and fairy tale like . A fast read.l.p.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this app, couldn't live without it. Always play it when I'm in the doctors office or anywhere else when I need to kill time.
B005LAII4E|3.0|What can I say about this movie. It is what it is; a G.I.Joe movie. Honestly, do we really expect epic greatness from a franchise based on a cartoon and toys? Really? Some products just are what they are. And if you've grown up on this like I did, and are honest, look back at the classic cartoon now. Like many childhood favorites, even those weren't stellar stories. But they were fun and silly entertainment. In fact, action cartoons didn't really get more \\"mature\\", if you will, until Batman and X-Men. I digress, this movie is based off of that, and primarily aspires to be that. You have tons of action, which I could tell they tried to take more seriously this time than the first while at the same time trying to maintain the fun of it for we who remember our childhood adventures. They also threw in cheesy, hip dialogue to look and sound cool. It of course doesn't always work, but look what you're working with. You'll either like it or hate it. I didn't expect anything monumental or groundbreaking. With that, it was basically entertaining but you won't remember it for any special reason. It's a living cartoon action movie. Isn't that all you should expect from G.I.Joe? I wish they wouldn't have killed off Duke though. Just saying. The acting was serviceable at best. Didn't seem anyone felt the need to really go all out here. The action was average mostly. Basically you've seen it before hundreds and thousands of times, save for a few clever pieces. All in all a basic movie made for fun. Anyone who dislikes this, I can't argue them. It's a take it or leave it proposition. I'm glad I at least viewed it once. It didn't make me want to gouge my eyes out. Until next time, happy mov
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My son loves this game and can't seem to put it down. I personally haven't played it. Rated it based on my son's opinion.
B00881VLCE|3.0|I solved one puzzle and now I can't seem to get any others to solve. I love to solve puzzles, so this was disappointing.
B005HSL626|5.0|I got this for my son because he loved it on Facebook. He plays constantly. I can't tell you how much this has helped when I need him to be quiet out in public.
B00C2VIA52|3.0|Good game but be aware you have to spend money to keep up with the new up dates they add cards that unbalance the game unless you have them
B004SBS8LA|5.0|He loves all the Angry Birds. He is always playing this. It's very addicting. :) Get it for your kid and enjoy the quiet for a while.
B003204MQS|5.0|This isn't the best movie ever, but for a one night cheap thrill, it isn't bad. Just make sure you pay attention at the end.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My son loves this game. He is constantly playing it. Buy it for your kids, give yourself a break. :)
B004JVXTL8|3.0|I think the explotation of the heart strings related to the baby made this a less appealing film for me. It just seemed to, try a bit to hard, and so it didn't have the same spark.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I can see what's going on with my friends anytime with this app. I love it and use it all the time.
B00715SUI6|2.0|Well what can I say, two hours of my life I can't reclaim for a movie that lacked the chills and the atmosphere of the first two. There were a couple campy scenes with the two girls that reminded me of my sister trying to scare me by hiding under the bed when I was 10, that is how good I found it.
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|Selling over 130,000,000 albums worldwide certifies that the \\"Backstreet Boys\\" are indeed wonderful singers and not just some bubble-gum singing team that are one hit wonders. \\"In a World Like This\\" ranks up there with some of the finest albums and come Grammy time I know they'll be taking a few home.<br /><br /> Wonderfully produced, the album really shines with the way the boys (really men now) sound. Yes they have great songs, producers and the like, but what has always sold them as an act are how their voices blend magically and you never get the feeling that their music will become outdated.<br /><br /> I do have some songs that I am not too crazy about on the CD, but that's not important. What is important are the ones I love, especially \\"Breathe\\" that I am sure will be released as a single as it's their best love song in their catalogue. The strings, horns, and voices make \\"Breathe\\" work into a memorable single that all will enjoy.<br /><br /> Welcome back boys!
B005J2UM9S|5.0|The beginning starts off a little slow, but once they get inside the Mental Hospital, the tension builds to an inescapable Crescendo. I was creeped out throughout the entire thing. I loved it. It is worth waiting through the cheesy beginning to get to the good parts.
B003IDMUWC|5.0|He is a very good and realistic writer.  Good charactics for the persons.  He describe the conditions for the black very good.
B009HEN9DU|5.0|My favorite movie so far.  I love the actors who play the characters in the movie.  I got this as a birthday present from my son and I am glad its on my Kindle so I can watch it anytime anywhere.  Love the era of this movie.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|A good book but a little bit unrealistic.  I can not think the story will happen in the real life.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|I use it a lot with my phone and can see what my friends have written and see pictures they posted.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|I believe this one will be a classic long after I am gone. Our family has enjoyed for several seasons.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Absolutely love it!! I'm just disappointed that I bought the full game on the 360 first. The card selecting is much better and the game itself runs smoother on my Kindle. Definitely 5 stars from me.
1433502410|5.0|This was the best ideal I have ever had should of did ten years ago while on vacation in Germany
B007N85POS|5.0|I really enjoy playing Angry Birds HD. I love it when more levels are added. Keep coming up with more levels & games!!!
B00005JNS0|5.0|This was the best ideal I have ever had should of did ten years ago while on vacation in Germany
B004R0WKNE|4.0|Enjoyed the movie.  No one dies, no loud explosions or obnoxious animation.  Pretty good performances by the cast. Would recommend to anyone wanting to watch a non insulting movie.
B009O2XY12|3.0|When you finish, you have to BUY more fruit.  I would like to see Kindle Fire get the real Fruit Pop game like the Nook has.  This one doesn't being to be as fun or interesting as the Fruit Pop on the Nook.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I just wish there were more levels.  I will keep an eye out for updates. My kids had a lot of fun searching for the clues and solving the puzzles.
B007VDN1PA|1.0|I was so excited to receive this product.  I read all the reviews and was confident in my purchase and I couldn't wait to review and copy my old negatives.  The device looks simple enough.  But the device wouldn't turn on.  Either the power cord was not working or the device itself.  I tried powering it up by plugging it into the outlet as well as directly into my computer.  Several people looked at the device as well as the instructions-it was clear that the device just wasn't working.  I tried to contact dbtech using the contact information given but after a week have not heard from them.  I also got on the web and contacted an alternative email address and still have not heard.  They do not provide a phone number to call.  I am returning this item.  Even though the device doesn't work I am still being charged to return the item.  Very disappointed.
B00BEZZBFO|5.0|I'm pasting this review from my website but you will have to go to my website in order to see the benchmark results because I cannot put pictures in Amazon reviews. I posted the link in the comments because Amazon doesn't allow URLs in reviews.<br /><br />Noctua has become one of the most popular companies in the cooling market and every enthusiast knows their products when they see one because of the color scheme that they use. The NF-S12A PWM is Noctua's third generation fan but there are also two other variations of the S12A series case fans, the ULN and FLX. These three variations are the new fans from Noctua and they are part of the S12A series fans. According to Noctua, they are 8% better than its predecessor thanks to the many new features such as the anti-stall knobs and the AAO (Advanced Acoustic Optimization) that can drastically improve the airflow/noise efficiency of your case.<br /><br />All three variations of the S12 series fans come with a 6 year warranty and with a MTBF of 150,000 hours. They also use Noctua's SSO2 bearing with metal bearing shell. The rear magnet is placed closer to the axis to provide better stabilization and durability thus creating less noise. The metal bearing shell is made from CNC milled brass that delivers long term stability and durability.<br /><br />The NF-S12A PWM model runs at a maximum of 1200 RPM with an airflow rating of 107.5 m3/h. It comes with a Low-Noise-Adaptor to reduce the maximum speed during PWM control from 1200 to 900rpm. It also comes with Noctua's custom designed NE-FD1 IC for fully automatic speed control via 4-pin fan headers.<br /><br />+Packaging:<br /><br />The packaging has a matte finish and feels very well in hand. The accessories inside are very well organized and every cable is covered and even the labels are printed in thick glossy paper. It definitely feels like a premium product just from looking at it and provides all the information you need to know about the product. These are the things that you will find inside the package.<br /><br />* 4 Silver Fan Screws<br />* 4 Brown soft rubber anti-vibration mounts<br />* Y Splitter cable (NA-YC1)<br />* PWM extension cable (NA-EC1)<br />* Low-Noise Adapter (NA-RC7)<br />* Manual<br /><br />Noctua puts a lot of R&D into their fan designs and it totally shows in the build quality. Most fans will not last that long; most fans come with a MTBF of 50,000 to 100,000 hours and most of them stop working before they even hit the limit; some even start to make high pitch weird noises. Since all the three new fans from Noctua come with a MTBF of 150,000 hours and 6-year warranty, it essentially pays for itself in the future since you don't have to keep buying new fans if it stops working. Noctua also has an amazing customer service that I have always been very fond of. I have lost mounting kits numerous times and they have always sent me new ones for free. They have even sent me extra fans free of charge. Seriously, how can you beat that?<br /><br />On each corner of the fan is a soft anti-vibration pad that helps prevent vibrations being passed from the fan into the case. They can easily be removed if you want to but I wouldn't recommend it since they are designed to stay there for a reason. I personally own many of their products such as the D14, NH-U9B SE2 and many more and have always been amazed at how efficient their CPU coolers and fans are from other brands in the industry and the NF-S12A PWM is no exception.<br /><br />While they do cost more than the competition, they are also made with better materials that last much longer than other fans. Also, I know that some people aren't very fond of the color scheme that Noctua uses on their fans but don't let that fool you because this is an excellent fan. I have had a lot of awful experiences with other fans but the fans from Noctua have never let me down. You can also use this fan on a radiator and it will make a big difference over the stock fans that come with the radiator. I have two of the Noctua's second generation fans (this is the third generation fan) installed on my H100i and I get amazing temperatures. The fans that came with the H100i used to make loud noises when they would run at full speed but with the Noctua's fan installed, it's now dead silent under full load. I noticed the temperatures drop by 3-5C against the stock fans that came with the H100i so it's definitely worth it if you ask me.<br /><br />So I installed this fan into my second rig because one of the fans has always made weird noises under full load and I never bothered to buy a new one but now that I got the NF-S12A PWM, I thought I should just use this one to test it out. My computer is obviously quieter now and I can't hear any high pitch whine at maximum speed. I will probably replace all the fans in my second rig with some of this because my computer is near my bed and I want the computer to be silent at all times. The only negative that I can think of that some people have with Noctua's fans is their color scheme. I personally don't care much about the colors because they are going to be inside my case and I'm not going to stare at my case 24/7. I'd rather have fans that I know will be great at airflow/noise and not be as attractive as some other fans than vice-versa. I would love to see Noctua release their fans with different color options for people that don't like the current color scheme.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />+ Sturdy<br />+ Dead Silent/Low Noise Fans<br />+ Easy Installation<br />+ Great packaging<br />+ Superb customer service<br />+ 6 Year Warranty/MTBF 150,000 hours<br />+ From Noctua (that alone should tell you something)<br />+ Guaranteed to improve the airflow of your case and drop the temperature<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- Pricey<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />Overall, the NF-S12A PWM fan is a premium fan and comes with a premium price tag but that is to be expected from a company such as Noctua that is specialized in creating high quality cooling components. Holding the fan in your hand easily shows that a lot of R&D has been put into designing this fan and I love the fact that it comes with a lot of useful accessories that you could ever want in a fan. It is crafted with high quality materials built to last a long time and is dead silent even at full speed. The 6 year warranty clearly speaks for itself and you are guaranteed that it will last you a long time.<br /><br />Also, another thing to note is that if you have a radiator and aren't satisfied with the temps you are getting then buying two of these fans (depending how large your radiator is) will drop the temp of your CPU. Not only that but it will also be whisper quiet even under full load. I highly recommend the NF-S12A PWM fan to anyone who wants the best fan on the market. If you have the cash to spend on a high quality fan, then I definitely recommend you get a few of these bad boys because it will make a big difference in the end. I know the color scheme might not be the best thing about this fan but don't let that fool you because this is an amazing fan.he radiator.

B004JN1D2I|5.0|The books are even better than the TV series, as usual, but in this case the series is so good I thought the books would be just as good, but they are faaaar better!!! And the best part, there's no end (well there is, but it's not yet in sight). I am usually so sad when I finish a good book, just want to linger on in that special world I entered. With the Game of Thrones bundle it just goes on and on without getting boring.<br />Anyone who likes the series must read it. I am not a big fan of fantasy books, but this is just different. It's fantasy with so much reality in it and truths that are applicable to the world we live in. Totally worth every dollar!!!
B0091REZMW|3.0|This game was cool in the beginning but you end up going thrum your diamonds if you don't connect to facebook.  It then severely limits what you can do and what tasks you can do to get further in the game without paying.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|I think the author did a good job of keeping true to Pi Patel's incredible story. It was a good read, and I recommend it. It touches on animal philosophy, religion & faith and shows a tremendous survivor. They did a great job on the movie too, by the way. :)
0062238868|4.0|The book is worth reading,  I did care about the altercations he had while training, bar fights.  I was more interested in how and why he became the sniper that he was while a SEAL.
B003O86FMW|3.0|This is the second of three books in The Hunger Games series and as is often the case, the second book was the weakest link.  It continued the fascinating saga of Katniss Everdeen but much of the book seemed to bog down and the plot seemed to be geared toward younger readers more than the other two books.  Overall, it was worth reading but not as entertaining as books one and three of the series.
1595827684|5.0|If you are a fan of Mass Effect, the aesthetics, open spaces, carachters, this books sounds greate. The quality is great too, with hard cover and paper &#34;couche&#34;.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|It was neat to see my home town of Cleveland as the backdrop for the movie.  It had a lot of action and kept my attention but no real story line.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|I've watched all the seasons so far. Great story line, many facets and a lot of surprises. I wanted to get the additional detail that the books would have over the series.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I am enjoying being able to use this app on my Kindle Fire HD. I had weather channel app on my KindleFire but when I downloaded it to my new HD it warped or something and was unusable. On the older Kindle Fire it is not updating correctly now.  Appreciate this Accuweather one right now as I use it everyday and so far it gives great info.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is a very fun game. You can interact with your horse. You clean your horse . Feed your horse.And you can compete.
B00CRS88IO|5.0|Excellent writing, smart dialogue and incredible action sequences make this a must read. I recommend to anyone whoever liked a Bond movie, the old Sean Connery ones (personal favorites) or the `Skyfall' era. Funny and thrilling and a perfect length.
B00DC7NNAC|5.0|Beautiful scenes, fantastic graphix and stunning Digital artwork.  The acting was right on, and the story flowed seamlessly.. definitely a must see for you Wizard of OZ fans.
B00CEF014E|5.0|Wow! This is one dark, twisted story. One of the best, if not the best, thriller I have read so far on Kindle. Where did this author come from? I loved his other book about Ian Fleming but this is a very different genre so that's two for two with this writer!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I have to say it is really well programmed.  It has versatile musical alarms fro your own library, and nice display.  It really needs to be able to display sideways though so you can prop it up and use it while charging. (Kindle charge port is at bottom)  However I still give it 5 just because it has saved me from being late for work :)
B008N1V11U|1.0|I bought it and waited a long time for the game to download then I went to play it and a white screen comes up and I can't do anything
B00DFFHUUA|5.0|I have to admit Willis and Johnson made a good team up in this.  I bout it.. so I guess I musta liked it lol
B00280LYHS|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It was action packed I could not put it down!!!!!!!!  So I totally recommend this book to everybody who likes Percy Jackson!!!
0345533054|4.0|This book was a great read because it was a lot like Tell no One. That was also the thing I disliked about it as well. It was a good book, but like I said before for, it is very, very identical to Tell no One.
B000IZ1HP4|5.0|I gave 5 stars because of the dramatic content. Sergio Leone knocked this one out of the park as usual.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have been wanting to play for a very long time and now I'm so happy that I get to!
0679805273|5.0|I love to give this as a graduation gift to someone with a sense of humor. It really does encompass a lot of sentiment & lends itself perfectly for tying in the writing of your own personal note inside. It's a keepsake they won't likely put in next year's yard sale. :)
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|I generally don't find academy award nominations too often make it to 5 star. Usually a little too artsy for me. Mostly I did not care for the story. Cooper has been in a mental institution and comes out trying to make a new life and get back with his wife. He's angry but I think the movie is overacted and I got bored with his tantrums  tantrums. Watchable but not my favorite. I turned off and back on to finish the next day.
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|Montana, North Dakota, and Saskatchewan: follow the geography, the coming of age time shift of a precocious fifteen year old boy who you will never forget. This is a sustained dream-like picaresque journey of extraordinary psychological perception beginning with parents who abandon their modest lives and their children in an unbelievable act of implausible criminal behavior. A brother and sister, twins, suddenly are on their own and the bizarre adventure of their separate journeys begins and carries the reader through their advanced adulthoods. This wonderfully crafted fiction echoes with the psychic displacements of Marilyn Robinson's sisters in \\"Housekeeping\\" while voiced with the ironical education of a latter day Holden Caulfield from Salinger's \\"Catcher in the Rye.\\" This is no ordinary coming of age memoir that can be easily forgotten.
B008XKSW7M|3.0|this movie was funny but all in all pretty predictable. but most movies are these days so nonetheless I enjoyed it.
B004GJDQT8|1.0|This is really hurting Amazon.  I consistently buy movies from Google Play because you don't have an instant video app for Android!
0425252868|5.0|I love books on WW11 since I was growing up at that time having been born in 1932 - the book is a fascinating account of the actions and bravery on both American and German airmen.  Was very disapointed  however to read about some of our American pilots shooting Germans who had bailed out of their planes and were floating to earth
B00563M11M|4.0|If your looking for great insight into human nature and a good laugh you'll get the first not the second. This is a serious book as discworld novels go it is also harder to read than most discworld novels. It just doesn't flow that well but it really has some thought provoking moments as one would expect from Prachett.
0385349947|3.0|The book gives some decent points for women in leadership roles. Her next publishing could be less of the names of executives and companies she's affiliated with and more of the life lessons learned while leading
B003TSEEDY|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read. Would definitely reccommend it to anyone. The book is much better than the movie, by the way, so read the book first if you haven't already seen the movie.
B005LAII4E|2.0|The movies starts of very well, establishing Roadblock and Duke's relationship (and Mouse) but as the other characters are introduced the feeling of chemistry isn't there - either the actors don't like each other or aren't provided motivation as to why their characters interact the way they do.<br /><br />For instance Lady Jane and Flint are supposed to have chemistry but that never materializes. Roadblock, Flint, and Lady Jane are supposed to have chemistry but that doesn't materialize and their interactions feel like a bad first date - there is a lot of mechanical talk, but no zing.<br /><br />That being said the non-action moments were kind of a pain to watch, but the action scenes didn't help either. Like the chemistry with the actors, the action scenes started feeling really B movie quality. Whether it was the lighting or post production or maybe even the camera angles or a combination of all mentioned the tank fight scene looked like a speed boat chase at the water park. The entire final fight scene looked like something out of a Buffy the Vampire slayer made for TV movie.<br /><br />The upside of the movie there were some good action scenes (the fight at the monestary and the attack on the underground prison), and some moments of good writing (the initial 5-25 minutes, the Fort Summter nuke disarmament talks, and the banter between Zartan and the President).<br /><br />In the end, the movie is kind of like this review disorganized with a few things that will be liked, but all in all probably not straight forward enough to be useful.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This game is pretty neat! The soundtrack really works for it. It takes some time to figure out exactly how to play it effectively, but once you get going... It is addicting!
B0080SZ0V8|1.0|I've had a hard time figuring out the purpose of the game.  It seems a waste of time to me.
B007MCTTHY|3.0|This game is alright. Not super exciting and can get pretty frustrating after the 1st few levels. Worth your time if you are looking for a slower paced puzzle game.
1609611543|1.0|I briefly skimmed this book after receiving it. It had a small amount of wheat information, but most of it focused on a low carbohydrate diet. He advised not only to avoid wheat products but also to avoid other carbs as well including fruits and other grains. We returned it to Amazon.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|I found this game to be highly frustrating! I am not a big fan of the build-your-own gadget games so maybe that is my problem.
B0092S4WLY|3.0|I don't mind the ads but the reason for 3 stars is there is only 8 levels. I can't imagine spending money on something that isn't fully developed. Fun game and concept but too done too soon. As I breezed through the levels I felt smart but after 8 the game was done and I had played for less than 10 minutes. Add more levels and I will add more stars.
B00COHAUD4|3.0|This is a movie that is creepy on a whole new level... I was waiting for something else to happen through the whole movie, but a totally out there movie!
B008WCP2PG|3.0|OK, I understand that this is a movie for women but don't be deceived into thinking there is a though provoking storyline to it.  In fact except for the dance sequences, there's not much reason to watch this movie.  The &#34;It's Raining Men&#34; part is the best in the movie and having it on DVD you can fast forward through the rest of the crap. I did find out one thing I wasn't aware of....Channing Tatum can dance!  I haven't seen his other dancing movies so I really had no clue, but in this movie, well, he burns it up.  this movie might be fun for a girls night in, but I'm glad I didn't pay the price at the theater to see it.
B004Z2TUGE|3.0|This story could fall right into the percy jackson book series. A sci-fi flick with some ok, but not extravagant CG graphics.
B009POCG0Y|1.0|I am a Matthew McConaughey fan and I watch everything he's in, even crap like this.  This is the weirdest movie I have ever seen.  The storyline could have been really interesting, but it was so stupid that it took away a lot of the interest for me.  There were so many nasty scenes in it that you might not want to watch it in mixed company, but if you want to watch it by yourself, be prepared to grimace a lot.  It was just not the type of movie that Matthew is capable of making, but for some reason he keeps picking these weird movies to make.  I didn't like it at all.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Works ok.  difficult to add different locations, they disappear sometimes. I sometime find that the weather often contradicts itself from the daily to hourly forecasts.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I usually do not read books like this.  I generally steer clear from a book that has sad/depressing subject matter, but this book reeled me in.  Please read this  book...you will love it.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I have a difficult time keeping my place.  A new feed pops up at the top of the page my location shifts and I have a difficult time finding where I was.
B0080SZ0V8|3.0|This would be fun game if i didnt have to tap kindle fire so many times to get it to work
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Good acting, excellent story lines and<br />suspense. I like the addition of the various<br />romances in the storyline. One does<br />not know what will happen next which<br />keeps things interesting.
B009NOVCTM|5.0|Purchase as gift for wife and she loves the collection through the ages of stones music. Highly recommend to those who are Stones fans.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Has over 100 M-I-L-L-I-O-N downloads worldwide for a reason.  Love the reading plans, video content, multiple versions available, etc.  Can't beat it.  [...]
B005K17RU0|4.0|The app works well with lots of detail.  My only problem is trying to delete a location.  Otherwise it is great.
B005723JSQ|4.0|Amazing ending loved the book!!! Wish it could have more detail towards the end so that it didn't seemed so rushed#!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so cute. You will have a blast. And so will your kids just like the temple run games
B00B3EJ0OY|5.0|Definitely one of me and my boyfriends all time favorite movies. Timeless, incredible, sad, happy, encouraging, just a phenomenal movie that everyone has to see.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app is excellent when you are away from a true alarm clock. It's easy to set day specific wake up times and the crescendo alarm (my alarm choice) wakes you up at the depth of your sleep at the time when  it goes off. That is, if your are about to wake naturally you hear the alarm early on and if you are in a deep sleep your hear it  later in the crescendo cycle when the volume is louder.  In fact, thinking about it, if my wife didn't like &#34;her&#34; alarm clock so well I'd use this on my Galaxy III as my daily alarm.  Excellent.
B0037QGRZG|5.0|This movies positive message is as relevant today as it was 25 years ago. My grandkids are now watching this, and is much better viewing than what is currently churned out for kid viewing. Two thumbs up.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|makes you use your brain a bit...gets harder with each level (as it should). good for individuals who like to solve puzzles.
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|I would have rated one less star except for the old adage “Don’t look a gift horse in the mouth.” You sure can’t beat the price.<br />I would have added another star if the print was large enough for me to read. The “Reading View” would be real handy here if it would work with PDF.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I first bought these headphones in 2010 for a mere $8.00. They worked great and stayed in my ears, unlike earbuds. Eventually a kink in the cord made the sound short out, so I purchased another set in June 2013 for $25.95. Little did I know that I would lose these on vacation and buy another set a month later for $39.99! What is happening here? I heard a rumor that they've stopped making these so I guess that would explain the price hike. Even if I lose this pair, I won't be purchasing anymore at this high price.
B00CTEP7O4|3.0|Story is of a high-powered, cocky attorney who takes on a rookie with no credentials but a photographic memory. I really enjoyed how they set up their first meeting and the subsequent situations that help them both evolve. I haven't watched the whole season yet, and that's part of the reason this gets a 4: I'm not hooked. It's entertaining, and I can detachedly laugh at the craziness of the legal world while being very glad I'm not a part of it. But that's what it is: entertaining. I haven't seen enough depth to make it a must-watch.
1439156816|4.0|The first part of the book is very entertaining as it is about Stephen King's  growing into adult-hood.  I got more from his writing style reading the autobio than I did the second part of the book as he instructs how to write.  All in all, I recommend it for writers, aspiring or published, because everyone needs to know where he gets all that stuff.
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|I though it was the Candy Crush game so this one was not useful to me. I want to have the real game. Can you tell me how can I dowload it. Thank you
B00DGN51O8|3.0|Hard to believe in Ian McShane as a noble king after watching Deadwood.  Characters just were not developed enough to really care about what happens to them.
B0019IB26I|4.0|I wasn't a big fan but liked a couple songs I'd heard. After getting the disk, I am a fan.
1592533868|3.0|I mainly brought it for greeting card ideas. The card ideas in this book are pretty monotonous, hence the 3 stars.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|Our kids have been watching this movie quite a  bit now and actually it hasn't gotten boring yet.  I think this movie was underrated/snowed under when it was released last December unfortunately.  A true gem with a few little scary moments .. but lots of great fun jokes.  Who wouldn't love to see a Santa like this one?
B0055Q5F36|2.0|I'm not sure why it didn't fit but I ended up tossing it in the drawer.  Wasn't worth shipping it back.  I ended up going to Sprint and purchasing an OutterBox Defender and it works great!  I'm giving it 2 stars because it was shipped pretty quick!
B000K7VHQ4|3.0|The disk is fine, but the case is broken. It will not close correctly. I wish the case had been completely intact or some note of the broken case had been given.
B0070XFNDE|5.0|I loved this book.  Zafon, as always, takes you into the story immediately.  When the book is over, you're not ready for it to be over!  If you have read Shadow of the Wind, and the Angels Game, you must read this book.  These books can be read in any order and they will flow together.  If you only read one of these, you will not miss the others.  But don't cheat yourself - read em all!  I'm gonna read em all again - and I never re-read books!!!!
B003TOMAPC|4.0|Came completely new, cardboard outer cover and all. My only complaint was that the shipping envelope seal was stuck to the outer box, and messed it up when I took the movie out.
B008602KQI|5.0|The books are so much better...but I still loved this movie. This movie will draw you in...wanting more at the end.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|The screen play and dialogue is well done.  Some, &#34;yea right&#34; but still quality TV!!!!!<br /><br />I would tell others to watch
B001M0HGR2|4.0|It turned out to be entertaining and at the end I enjoyed the film. Good special effects, nice story line for &#34;actions&#34; and &#34;comics&#34;. The protagonist (Tony Stark) looks natural: arrogant, brash, but at the same time clever, intelligent and ethic. The villain is a little bit overreacting, and annoying, as most of antagonists :) Overall that's a good movie.
B001KL0WJW|4.0|i heard about the film via a countdown of improv in films on entertainment and was excited to see I could watch it on Amazon Prime.  It was definitely entertaining and I enjoyed seeing James Remar as a young man, instead of as hotel mogul Richard Wright on Sex & the City!
B005TVYVI2|1.0|My children need this for their swim team. We have one that works. The other one failed after two months and many batteries. I probably spent more on batteries than on the Tempo Trainer.  Need to order another but there are no other options. Very disappointing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great app and its free. Very realistic and great graphics. I would definitely recommend getting this app!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Couldn't put the book down. This was a great book that had me thinking days after I was done reading.
B008QYT7DI|5.0|Very deep analogies. I read this book to my students every year and it is amazing how they get to understand the Baibabs, Fox and all the other characters and how to apply this learned knowledge to their own life.
B007WFTFG6|1.0|I downloaded and installed on tablet. Immediately after install,  I didn't run it, mcaffee said a security threat found and uninstalled it.
B00DU73T08|4.0|Considering the book is based on an INTERNAL battle between the invading alien and the legitimate human that owns the invaded body, I thought it was a decent movie.<br /><br />Acting was very good and a lot of the settings and times were as described in the book maybe even better.
0553212753|5.0|This was such a very well written book. The words throughout it were so captivating. I loved how well described the characters and their feelings were. It made me feel as though I was living in their time period. I really enjoyed learning a bit of what life was like in that time. The bonds of family were very strong in this book. I really loved the speeches that Mrs. March gave from time to time. Although she didn't say very much, she said everything so wonderfully. I truly admired her. It was great to see how Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy each lived. They all had their own story and held me in to understanding what their feelings were or why they acted in different ways. Although I feel the ending was a bit unrealistic, it was interesting! I especially loved the first half of the book and the romantic tales throughout the book.
B000PC0S5K|4.0|Several years ago, while seeking counsel with my therapist, I was introduced to something that reshaped my life.  He shared with me a book that he kept in his briefcase and carried with him every day.  My therapist told me he had read this book at least a half a dozen times and it was the foundation for not only his sessions, but his life.  That book was A New Earth.  At the time, I was struggling with finding acceptance of a recent divorce and the challenges with starting a new relationship while working thought the difficulties of devastated children as the result of divorce.  This book changed not only the course of my life, but opened my eyes to the mysteries that were right there in front of me waiting to be discovered.  I call this book a \\"gateway\\" book, because it set a firm foundation from which I developed the courage and desire to read more.  Since then, I have read at least 25 books on spirituality. I tell my friends and family and anyone who will listen that the most amazing thing about this book and the other 25 I've read is that the message is similar:  we are more than we know and have the power to shape our lives.  Our entire existence is solely created by the creative power of our minds and hearts.  I have bought at least 8 copies to share with friends and family.
0060581808|4.0|It is a shame that I had this book since I was a child and only NOW read it. I think it was so interesting learning about life in the 1870s with what was cooked, how things were farmed, what celebrations went on, etc. I am glad that Laura Ingalls Wilder wrote these books that give not only her own personal accounts of things to pass down in generations, but a wonderful history of what life was like. Very fun. Definitely something adults can enjoy!
B001NLL0RW|4.0|If you like a good spy novel you can't go wrong with James Rollins. The Doomsday Key does not disappoint.
1423113462|5.0|I did read the Percy Jackson and the Olympians books and found them enjoyable. This book, starting out the sequel set called Heroes of Olympus, was even more amazing. I am excited to read the rest now!<br /><br />The story is about 3 characters: a demi-god named Jason (not to be confused with the Jason from stories of old), a demi-god named Leo, and a demi-goddess named Piper. Each one of these people have different stories. Somehow they are all in a school together and have fond memories from the past three months, although Jason has no idea who he is or who anyone is, while these people seem to know him. He is so confused. Little do they each realize how important each of them are and the friendship that they share together! They each have unique skills and Jason is a born leader.<br /><br />I would say so much more but it would spoil so much! This was very much in line with how the Percy Jackson books each spanned their stories, but this was even better. If you have read the Percy Jackson books, read this! Trust me!
B0044XV3R8|5.0|Avatar (Three-Disc Extended Edition) is probably my favorite movie of all time. Through fantasy & fiction, James Cameron brings us up close & personal with the natural environment around us, including creatures we dismiss out-of-hand as being inferior to us & therefore not worth our respect of even being alive.<br /><br />Avatar is the kind of film that will mesmermize the entire family, regardless of age, for close to three hours of fun & excitement.
0439023521|5.0|I didn't truly know what this book was going to be about, but it was bought for me and I read it. I loved the amount of descriptions in it that really sucked me into the story, wanting to read what happened next. It is a story about a girl named Katniss who lives in District 12, a coal miner part of the country. Each year there are games between the districts where kids between 12-18 are chosen to fight each other to the death. Katniss will be entering these games along with Peeta, a fellow student who is a baker's son. Throughout the book we learn a lot about survival and love. It is quite interesting! I read this book a few years before the movie came out by the way (Yes, book is better than the film).
B009AMAGQM|5.0|Though Beautiful Creatures is definitely not in the same league as many previous films on witchcraft, it is enjoying & amusing none-the-less. Great family fun!
1451629192|4.0|This book was written by Jaycee Lee Dugard, who was kidnapped at the age of 11 and kept captive in the backyard of her kidnapper for 18 years! She reviews her time before she was kidnapped, during her first memories as a captive, through the crazy abuse (sexual & mental & verbal) which she received. I really love her attitude throughout the book. She seems very caring and loving despite all she went through, and harbors no hate, but just continues to live her life with whatever she goes through. It is definitely something we can all learn about. You can truly see what a lonely life she lived, but she has a feeling she has been blessed regardless. That's awesome.
B005LAIHYU|5.0|Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is fun fiction of what Abraham Lincoln's younger days might have been like, a time filled with vampires & their influence on the Civil War. Though the film does not compare to Joss Whedon's Buffy or Angel, the storytelling is quite entertaining & definitely worth the price of a DVD.
0142421715|3.0|I liked the first book more, but they were pretty equal! This book continues from Matched. We have two perspectives: Cassia's and Ky's. Cassia wants to find Ky and Ky wants to find Cassia. All they can do is think about each other, though Cassia longs for even more. She wants to find out answers and to live life without Society choosing out her life. Ky wants to just live in peace with the woman of his dreams. We learn so much more about Ky in this story as well as Xander (Cassia's match in Society)! There are new characters as well like Indie, Vick, Eli, and Hunter who have stories of their own that have led them to be with Cassia and Ky. It was a very moving story and I enjoyed it! The poetry was deeper in this than in the first book. The descriptions were just as lovely as the first though. I look forward to the next book! The only problem I had with this book was how similar parts of it were in the beginning to being a mix of The Hunger Games, 1984, and Red Dawn. Of course it had a lot of originality to it as well. Because of the similarities (the first book was more original) I rated it a little lower than I would have liked to.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|X-Men: First Class is fantastic storytelling that won't disappoint X-Men fans. The film answers many questions regarding how the various X-Men met & the origins of their struggles with normals or non-mutants.<br /><br />One note: In the last few minutes of the film, set in 1962, we see Professor X get shot & become crippled, relagated to a wheel chair for the rest of his life. This contradicts the ending of X-Men Origins: Wolverine, which showed Professor X walking out of a helicopter in 1979. In Entertainment Magazine (August 2nd, 2013), the producer explained away this contradiction by saying that in the later film the Professor was simply projecting an image of himself to the young mutants.
0786838655|4.0|This was a very good story. I enjoyed it a lot but it wasn't an epic story that I think I'd want to read more than once. I'm sure my sons will enjoy it when they grow older.<br /><br />There is a boy named Percy who has been mocked in school and really only has one friend who is a little weird. He loves his mom but she sends him around to so many schools because something odd always ends up happening (things he can't explain). When strange things happen some more in his newer schools and people are not remembering things that he knows occurred, only one of his teachers and his friend seem to be in on a secret. Through it he finds out his mom knew a secret too. The mystery has to be about his father, who turns out to be some sort of god that he learned about in all his Greek mythology lessons. When monsters keep following him and he gets sent to a summer camp his dad suggested to his mom when she was pregnant with Percy, maybe answers will be found. Maybe adventures will happen.
B0042J6VUS|3.0|The title practically tells my full opinion about this product. The most well-made part of this product is the cradle that your phone sits in, but you can hardly have a case for your phone. Even worse is scratched my iPhone 4's steel sides
1423101502|4.0|Percy Jackson is going to turn 16. The great prophesy is almost ready to take place. There are some mysterious things that Percy has to find answers to. He tries to do the right thing so that he won't do anything to bring down Mount Olympus. So much is in his hands. What will happen to Percy and his friends this year? Well, although I kept guessing some things while reading it, what I thought would happen didn't and the story was definitely more kid-friendly of an ending. . . although I don't think I'd want my kids reading these until they are adults. It was not too bad of a series. I think I gave all the books a three star rating.
B006JTS5OO|5.0|The movie is great, the soundtrack was easy to download, as was the digital copy, and the blue Ray was beautiful.
0061726834|3.0|I had higher hopes for this book. Although I read it within a day, I couldn't stay connected enough to the characters. The story was about a dystopian society where you are unable to love at all. They gave a procedure at 18 to all to prevent everyone to fall in love as if love was an infection/disease. I saw too many flaws in the story but at times it was lovely. Lena, the main character wanted to follow all the rules. Meeting a guy would open her mind and life to truths she might not want to learn but craves knowing. Content in the story (for parents who are curious for your teenagers) is usage of profanity, disobedience to guardians and others, some violence, underaged drinking, kissing, girl takes her shirt off as well as a guy, and talk of suicide.

B001EBYM62|5.0|This is the best musical ever made.  Who am I to vote less and 5 stars. Keep old movies alive.
B005LJITS0|4.0|This was not a work of art but it was an enjoyable bit of escapism. There are other recent movies in this genre that I like better, for example, The Avengers.
B003OUXECE|5.0|It is good to read the book after playing the Bioshock 1&2 , many characters are described in details and you can feel their thoughts and feelings, story is epic, everything is connected reasonably.
B00005N6KG|1.0|Ear buds won't fit my ears, but these fit perfectly and provide relatively good sound.  The problem is that they inevitably break after around a year of use - one of the ear pieces always seems to stop working.  If  they were more durable they'd get five stars, considering the price.  EDIT 9/21/16:  Reduced to one star because of massive price increase.  They're still the best of their kind, but $90 for these is a totally ridiculous price.  If somebody could manufacture a decent copy of these, they'd make a killing.

B0079XNWQA|5.0|Great songs by a great songwriter.  Girlfriend loves it so you can't really go wrong with that.  She also likes the fold out poster.
B0002YLC24|5.0|I haven't watched this movie yet because our dvd player quit working. For this reason, I can not rate it.
B009MO5E10|5.0|I went in to this movie without much expectation. I ended up loving it. You can read the summary of the movie, so no need to repeat it, but the acting in this movie is great. The bad guy, Monday, really makes you hate him. Wilee makes you root for him. There are a few laugh out loud moments as well. I would recommend this movie and have already had several friends and family members check it out. They all enjoyed it as well.
B0045HCIZY|4.0|I haven't watched this movie yet because our dvd player quit working.  Therefore, it's impossible for me to rate this movie at this time.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it is awesome, fun ,and easy to play this app. You can also choose diffrent minions that are really cool!
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Kind of disappointed that it only had 10 levels. Fun to play even though level 10 was a butt confusing.

B00BJA2VFW|5.0|They did an amazing job with this game! I love it just as much as this company's other games. Definitely worth purchasing if you're tired of micro-transactions and Facebook sharing nonsense.Pure pupuzzle fun with no distractions.
B00AQ71FLK|3.0|Phantom update killed the game please fix and stop with phantom updates they broke 3 of your games so far that iv played. Do we get a free daily spin for this and what about the people that payed for stuff and now can't play. FIX THIS. Update:game has been fixed upped it to 3 stars can't give 5 stars you mess up all you're game to much, really slow to fix them and you don't offer any explanation for any of the problems when they come up.
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|Surprisingly decent.<br /><br />I thought this would be a lame teen movie. Although it is about teens, it's not lame.<br />It's a guilty pleasure, I wouldn't go around telling people this was amazing and to please watch. But I enjoyed it.
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|Love it !,,,,,,, I am watching season 5 and I know when I've seen all 7 I will be sad to see this great drama end. I doubt they will make anything close to it again. It was gritty, raw, edgey and something you would expect to see from the BBC. Well worth watching, I hope to see more like this police drama, if this cast returned for season 8 , they would be welcomed by fans such as myself.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|At 35$ I got the streamer, an HDMI extension cable, a high quality USB power source, a charging cable, and 3 months free for Netflix. A great deal.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is a very fun game it gets harder but that's half the fun of it . This was a very good buy
B000FC10WU|5.0|Just a straight mystery that holds your attention; no convoluted plots, very logical, and an easy read.  Miss Marple is wonderful.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this app ....they could add some things though..like picking out the horses hoof's<br />and buying your horse hay to eat they could even sell hay bags!
B001NHNG64|5.0|I only recently started reading this series and I have found it to be quite the page turner.  The author slowly builds the intensity of the story until you find yourself reading faster and faster to find out what happens next.  Kudos!
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|Id like to play the real version of Candy Crush. If the real game was in the apps store then this game would become useful, at the moment there is no need for this app.......
B009WUBERW|1.0|There are high school plays that have better acting. Of course these &#34;superstar&#34; actors may be doing the best that they can with the pathetic dialogue. It is hard to believe that anyone got paid to do this.
0062059963|5.0|if you read the first book (and loved it) you just gotta read this one. waiting waiting on the next.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|This app gave me fits. It never once loaded a YouTube video but kept kicking out to the browser or shutting down the Kindle.Tried it several times with vids, music and anything I could find hoping for something to work, no luck. This was a terrible app and I'm glad it's off my machine.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|The game in and of itself is fun and challenging however it has major issues. I have been playing for almost a month and during that time I have had to uninstall and then reinstall the app on numerous occassions.. When this happens the majority of the time your rewards (magic powers) are lost. The game itself will occasionally glitche and you may lose a life or gain one or even lose all your lives or end up with several extras. This is really just luck of the draw. Having said all that I still play several times a day. Not at any point have I put any of my actual money into this game and my facebook sync is just fine. So the question is would I purchase this game even with the problems that I have had? Sure would.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|When one episode ends I can't wait to watch the next one!!  I was really shocked about some of the events this season. I can't wait until season 4 starts!!
B003Y5H54W|3.0|I have a few friends say that they were not impressed with this movie but sometimes I like stupid movies to just &#34;veg&#34; out with.  This will be one of those &#34;veg&#34; movies when my expectations aren't running too high.
B00932A4XE|3.0|This movie was only Ok. Stereotypical roles and acting. Big names but not big performances. Good when you just want to be mildly entertained.
B000I9U8VO|3.0|I bought this just basically because it was the only one in the series that I didn't have.  Only saw it once prior to buying it.  Like the rest of the movies it is entertaining.
B004I8WD7S|4.0|fits nicely. Feels comfortable. Have not dropped the phone yet! priced very reasonably. need more choice of colors for appeal.
B001P7HUF0|5.0|John Grisham's story is compelling and the cast makes it all work.  Matt Damon and Danny Devitto were a great match.  They played off each other very well and the rest of the cast fit their roles to a tee.
B00CDT41RY|1.0|usual action. senseless gory violence without purpose. too dragged out in some scenes. photography is good. Acting is so so.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|great fun game! love the graphics.  best uno game out there hands down. although I do wish there was a way to get coins faster to play more games.
B004VD3YIM|1.0|I tried ver yhard over and over but doesnt connect to any of my cameras. Only predetermined cameras are avaialble
B00AREIAI8|4.0|really enjoy playing this game with my kiddo and the scenery is very nice, family friendly. love that this game is free also.
B005544V6A|5.0|I love this show! The characters are engaging, the writing is smart, and there is sarcastic humor tossed in. I think the &#34;big secret&#34; could be eliminated and the show would still be great.
B006LSZECO|5.0|What an awesome read.  Lots of twists and turns to keep you turning the pages until the end.  I didn't want it to end!
B005DD7H50|5.0|The movie is great but I had a bad download. The movie kept cutting off. It took me 3 1/2 hrs to watch it all the way through.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This season had a lot of ups and downs ( no pun intended) . The streaming was consistent and I enjoyed watching it on my tablet.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|THE REAL STORY OF THE MEN AND WOMAN WHO FOLLOWED ORDERS AND WERE PROUD TO SERVE THEIR COUNTRIES BUT HAD TO LIVE IN DEPLORABLE CONDITIONS AND MOST HAD NO TASTE FOR KILLING EVEN THE ENEMY, THIS IS A GREAT LOOK INTO THE MINDS OF THOSE WHO FOUGHT THE AIR WAR AND HOW THEY REALLY FELT ABOUT WHAT THEY WERE DOING, VERY WELL WRITTEN, EASY TO FOLLOW, NOT TO TECHNICAL OR BORING ITS MORE ABOUT THE PEOPLE AND NOT BIAS TOWARD ANY COUNTRY OR CAUSE, WELL DONE
1476727910|5.0|I must start by saying that I really, really loved this book and have already given it as a gift to others.  That said, I would like to briefly respond to some of the earlier negative comments.<br /><br />I did NOT find it at all unpleasantly predictable.  If you guess where it might be going at times, it is still well worth the ride getting there.<br /><br />I did NOT find it too gushingly pro-human.  Even after he has chosen to remain among us, the Professor Martin replacement is well aware of our faults and weaknesses.  He does, after all, still withhold the proof of the Reimann hypothesis from us. He admits that we are, by far, not the most intelligent organism on the planet. And most importantly, by the end of the novel, he doesn't seem to have achieved a complete grasp of the human condition himself. But then, who among us has?  At least he understands his ignorance and continues to try to lessen it.<br /><br />I did NOT find it preachy or boring.  Some of the 97 points of advice he leaves his \\"son\\" are somewhat contradictory and a few are downright (alien) odd. To me, they imply that he wants to help the boy, but like most of us, is still confused about what it really means to live a good life, deal with humanity's problems and make the most of its potential in the short time we have.<br /><br />Again for me, it was often laugh aloud funny with an ironic twist, but it was also much more serious than \\"Third Rock From the Sun\\" and therefore much more poignant.<br /><br />I can't recommend it too highly.
140006922X|5.0|Two words: must-read. Most(if not all) books always dealt with the miracles and divinity of the Jesus. Whereas this book focuses mostly on the politics, perceptions and feelings of the people, and environment of the time of the Jesus, and what may have occurred that may have helped sculpt him in making certain decisions and directions he chose to take. And who better to scrutinize the time period and the Jesus than Reza Aslan, a 20 year scholar of religion, who happens to be muslim(who by the way wrote a book about the Mohammad-check it out) who delves deep into the political forces driving the beliefs of the time and shows us the Jesus as a man living amongst men(and women). This is not a definitive all-fact book, there is speculation. However it is intelligent speculation based on historical evidence to support what was occurring during this tumultuous and pivotal point in the legacy of Rome, the strength of the Hebrew faith, and the religious fervor that was brewing around the Jesus. Must-read.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|Great game LOVE it but still got bugs.Get the bugs out I would rate it a five. But I still like it
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I love this show so much! I've gotten so invested in the characters, and I think that each character - lovable or sinister - has so many layers that you can find moments to feel for even the most deplorable characters. But the last episode of the third season felt contrived during the last couple of minutes. I felt a little let down and as though I'd been slapped in the face. I guess I'll just have to see how they make it up to us in the fourth season!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Collins masters the main emotions of the human condition: desire, fear, hunger, and love. The best of the trilogy .
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|this game is addictive there is plenty of challenges to keep you busy.  the game being free is a big bonus
B00CZF87TY|5.0|The songs are great and always put me in a good mood!<br /><br />I can't wait until the movie is available on blue ray and dvd!
B00CBKLO52|1.0|this can make a huge dent in your pocket it may seem free but its definitly not i hate it
B00BB8Q13A|5.0|amazing movie...can watch it multiple times...you can feel yourself disappearing in the dialogue and the scenery. would recommend it to anyone, shakespeare fan or not
B00BP4Z8XY|2.0|I thought I would be able to watch the movie with my 4 year old. Way too much violence and innuendo's. She told me it was too scary and she walked away from it. Good decision on her part because it only became more so.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I downloaded this app several months ago; and it was great ... full of useful information ... simple to use ... ad-free.<br /><br />Then they changed it ... now it is loaded with large, annoying ads ... cluttered ... hard to use ... disgusting!<br /><br />I deleted it from Kindle &amp; now enjoy using a competitive weather app.<br /><br />I would never recommend this sorry app!  If I could give it minus five stars, I would eagerly do so!!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Just an awesome read. I have already recommended book to 3 people.  I love Steven Kings work. my Husband couldn't put it down.  Great Book.
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|Just another blind idiot who has written a book of lies that has not experienced the most important requirement for getting into heaven. \\"You must be born again as a little child to enter into the kingdom of God. He like most all other so called Christians are missing that vary thing because only God choses those people. Not some one behind a pulpit or a person just joining the Christian parade of faith because they fear death. He left the True Jesus because he has really never met the man or was ever at the cross of Calvary. He is dishing out confusion and now has placed himself into the peril of the last verses of Revelations. Amazon.com is selling a book called \\"Taken into time by the Spirit of God\\" that is in my opinion the best Christian book out there that you can believe and relate to.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|Fast and easy to access, the video was clear, loaded quickly and flawlessly.  Loved the movie and the ease of watching!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Loved the movie.  Good lesson for everyone including kids. lol!  Wish they made more movies like that instead of &#34;shoot them up&#34;<br />ones.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Ms. Grout has written an amazing book on LOA. I have been following this since The Secret came out in 2006. What separates her book from the others are these easy to follow experiments that prove that The Universe is really shaped by our thoughts.<br />Every single experiment in this book worked for me. Here are my results:<br /><br />Experiment One: (Results) My boss bought my lunch today. I also had to pick up my brother from his work at Applebee's. His manager wanted him to stay an extra hour, and I guess he felt sorry that I had to wait, so he kept sending me free chips, salsa, drinks, and a side salad.<br /><br />Experiment Two: (Results) I just happened to look out my kitchen window while cleaning dishes, and saw a sunset yellow VW coming down the road. While at my mother's house, I saw many yellow butterflies while tending her vegetable garden.<br /><br />Experiment Three: Like Joan Crawford said, \\"No wire hangers ever!\\" I don't have any in my house. I'll pick some up next time I'm at work, and try the experiment.<br /><br />Experiment Four: I decided to manifest something easy, yet difficult at the same time. I wanted to see a red rose. I guess I need to clarify to the Universe that I wanted a physical red rose because that night I turned on the TV to watch Married With Children, and I saw AL wearing a giant red rose in his tuxedo button. I'm still counting that.<br /><br />Experiment Five: (Results) I really wish to take a vacation to Washington D.C. in October. I asked God if this was a good idea, and if he would help me along the way. That afternoon at work, I'm sitting at my desk, when all of a sudden (literally out of no where) my co-worker turns to me and says, \\"I hate how there are absolutely no good Mexican restaurants in D.C. Being from Texas, this is difficult.\\" I just stared at her in confusion. I never brought up my trip to D.C. It was like she read my mind. That night, I logged into Tumblr, and all that kept showing up on my dashboard were photos of cherry blossoms and Washington D.C.<br /><br />Experiment Six: (Results) I tried the experiment where I linked my fingers together. I noticed that when I told the truth my fingers stayed firmly linked, and when I lied they broke apart. You have to try the experiment yourself to understand what I'm talking about.<br /><br />Experiment Seven: (Results) I lost a few pds of water weight by blessing my food, and praying before I ate.<br /><br />Experiment Eight: (Results) Back to my D.C. trip. I really want to go, so I asked The Universe, \\"If you really want me to go to D.C., then you will send me an unexpected e-mail from my ex.\\" That night, I sent my ex good vibes, and when I finished, I heard a voice in my head saying, \\"Check your hotmail tomorrow.\\" Now, I haven't checked my hotmail since last year. I totally forgot I had it. Confident that an email from my ex would be there, I went to sleep. When I awoke the next morning, I logged into my hotmail account, and skipped over 500+ emails. I was getting frustrated because I couldn't see anything from my ex. At the very bottom, I saw an email from April. The subject line looked like spam, but I opened it anyway. I found a letter from a woman who found my official blog and was writing me for info on my famous cousin. One of the reasons why I wish to visit D.C. is because I happen to be related to quite a famous FBI member, and I want to see his grave and former house. The email I read from the woman stated that she wanted info for a report she is doing in college. I was excited. I may not have gotten an email from my ex, but I got something that tied into my D.C. trip.<br /><br />Experiment Nine: (Result) As of today, I'm still working on it. I love performing random acts of kindness.<br /><br />After reading the book, I returned to Amazon to write my review. I'm shocked that a lot of these experiments didn't work on some of these reviewers. One reviewer even stated that the book was difficult and \\"Over his head.\\" Hardly. The author is hilarious and her explanations on science are extremely easy that a 1st grader could understand them. I highly recommend this book. I'm returning to read it tonight.<br /><br />(This review is also linked to my Goodreads account.)ly.

B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I knew I would like this but my wife liked it even more ,,  shipped quickly well wrapped and secured .  I am once again a satisfied customer of Amazon..  Lost count of how many wonderful products I have gotten here ..
B000NY12LO|4.0|I read this as one of my options for my high school summer reading assignment. Once I got a little more than half way through it I really enjoyed it but the first half was a little boring. Of course a lot happened but I just found it as more of an explanation. I do like how you get everyone perspective but it could also get confusing at times. I would recommend to teens who like mysteries and stereo typical high school dramas.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I love Tina Fey, I love humor-filled books, and I love things that are easy to relate to. This is a fantastic read and I can't put into words how much I loved this book.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I'm a big Jeffrey Archer fan so this was just the perfect ending to this trilogy.  Very well written as are all of his books that I have read.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|Thor is a well made movie. Exciting for all ages, young and old! Good cast and acting. Lots of action.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|It captured my attention, I could not put it down.  It is a great mystery, and captivating story.  I loved it from beginning to end.  I might read it again.
B004ZN9W5M|5.0|I love everything about this album.I love just listening to the music when I am sitting an having alone time.
B000KFB4PK|5.0|It is comfortable and fun to wear and it tells the time. Guaranteed to spark a conversation and I am pretty sure your IQ goes up while you wear it. Enough said.
B000002JK4|5.0|This has all the songs I like.Ive been wanting to replace this album for a while I lost the other in Katrina.
0316228532|1.0|I never would have finished it except that it was my book club's choice for the month. She was taking advantage of her fame.
B008NW67E0|5.0|It is a good album but after a while it all sounds the same.I would have to hear more songs from them.
0091922348|5.0|Once in 20 years someone writes a book on food that changes how people eat.  This is the chef who did it.  Now I am having fun and eating magnificent food along with everyone else in London.  Bon appetit.
B006ICOK00|3.0|The camera works trouble-free. Easy to setup and with just enough features, even though it could use a bit more flexibility when choosing the interval between pictures (1-3-5-10-etc but not in between). The quality of the resulting video (avi right out of the box) is quite poor, surely not for the higher-end market. Overall a decent product for the right timelapse.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I am not a scify fan at all but as that part is brought into this series it is writrn so believable that I am continually drawn deeper in.Just a great read all the way around.
B008JFUO0Y|3.0|Nice little gore fest....but, I guess I expected more horror...I would've rather rented it though...not a good purchase in my opinion.
B002W7H3EA|4.0|A classic with stars from the past.  It has a complex plot with an unexpected twist.  There are some great scenes.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Great purchase...I saw it in the theatre and I was amazed.  I did not think an ensemble hero movie could be pulled off so brilliantly without taking spotlight from others...great movie either you're into the whole superhero thing or not.
B004UPANAI|5.0|Love Amazon Instant Video. What a great idea for someone who doesn't have premium channels and it is less than On Demand.
B005PK57NU|3.0|Even if you don't know much about law and politics, or if you don't find them interesting,  you may still enjoy this show. There is such a broad range of cases in every episode, plus the typical addicting drama from work the characters' personal lives. Watch it.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|This book held my interest to determine what exactly was going on and why.  I felt that the resolution of these questions was very imaginative.  I will read other books in the series, but I think it will be difficult for the author to maintain the same sense of mystery contained in this book, assuming that the reader has already read this book.  I hope that I will be wrong about that.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|This movie had been recommended to me without spoilers, so the story was a pleasant surprise. I enjoyed the characters, and the entire cast made the movie work so well.
B006FTCH2E|2.0|Like watching paint dry. Slowly, VERY, very, slowly. Honestly, not only was it slow, but I thought it was &#34;SciFi,&#34; and, boy was that wrong!
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Miss. Dugard went through every child and parents worst nightmare. In Broad daylight, she was kidnapped by a complete stranger, one so psychotic that he held her hostage for 18 years in his backyard. This book is Jaycee' s triumph story of her hopes, dreams and fears as she lives with just distant memories, of her once known life.<br /><br />Reading this book will arise an array of different emotions, from anger, sadness, to happiness as you get to see what an inspiration this young lady had turned out to be to millions, even after such a horrible ordeal. Raw emotion is read with every page, and you share in Jaycee' s pain as she recaps the endurance of some of the worst years of her life.<br /><br />A complete must read for all!
B00005JKDR|1.0|I bought this used from someone and when I received it, it was so scratched it wouldnt play. My girlfriend and I tried to fix it- put it through a few things to help remove the scratches, but nothing helped. We both got so annoyed and fed up with it, I took it out of the DVD player and threw it out. Absolutely worst purchase ever. Person selling it should have said &#34;it won't play.&#34; Would have saved me time and money.
0756407915|5.0|I did not expect Wise Man's Fear to be so much better than Name of the Wind. I won't get into a long review but this was truly a book that engaged the mind and soul. The continuing saga of Kvothe grabbed the reader from the first chapter and never let go. It is a rare treat to find a long book this satifying. I can't wait for the next edition to be released. Great Job Patrick !!
B002N44XSG|5.0|Funny, witty, and full of the Percy Jackson we love! Excellent companion, a good read for all Percy Jackson fans. Go Percy!!!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Why did you change it? I used the Weather Channel app daily.It was easy to read and I enjoyed the other features. The maps were detailed and I liked being able to zoom in on the satellite map.Now the maps look like a cheap copy, not professional. PLEASE go back to the old version!
B00AHGSVKS|3.0|I read this book with the hope  it would match the same thrill of Clarke's 2001 series but it did not deliver . The twist is somewhat anti-climactic. Clarke still dazzles with picture perfect delivery and engages the reader with foreshadowing that can be sometimes a little too straight forward. It's a solid read however and at 200 pages and change its worth your time if you're in the mood for a short sci-fi novel.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I was determined to finish this book before seeing the movie. Just finished it yesterday (finally) and I loved it. The format is perfect for this type of story. The author tells this story from every possible point of view and some of the stories overlap. The best part is that the stories contain a lot of detail. I was pleasantly surprised by this book. The violence factor was appropriate for the stories but not too graphic.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|Paul is a good movie. Simon Peg is very funny and the voice of Seth Rogan as &#34;Paul&#34; is perfect! Kudos to all in this film.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|I play this sound track every chance I get and actually purchased one for a young teen who watched the movie with me.
B002ZG976U|5.0|I love this movie! The costumes, score and choreography are amazing. I am happy to own a copy of this film.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This movie was recommended to me and I was stunned at the intensity and instant involvement I felt watching this horrific event happen before my eyes.  The entire cast are amazing actors.  Everyone that worked to produce this film should be applauded for their work.  I was definitely crying while watching this.  In my book this is a must see movie.
B000LN7HUC|5.0|I got to use this on an overnight kayaking trip and was extremely happy with it. I usually go with a soda can stove but this is so much more stable. I can't see ever going back.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i love this app it is very good.  you earn stuff when u do good. the app loads very good
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|You know what Angry Birds is. It is probably the most popular computer game in the world. It's probably the most downloaded app in existence. It's been praised by users and critics alike.<br /><br />And it deserves all that praise.<br /><br />Angry Birds combines simple controls with a ton of variety. This is accomplished thanks to the game picking which birds you can use, which adds to the challenge. Beating a level usually isn't a challenge, but trying to get three-stars on everything can be an all-week event.<br /><br />Buy this game. Your kindle won't be complete without it.
0525953728|5.0|This is a compelling book.  I had a hard time putting it down.  You are reading about an important event in modern history written by a modern day warrior.
0385474547|5.0|'Things fall apart' feels like it should be an HBO miniseries. Okonkwo, the main character, is a classic, believable antihero, who is joined by a large supporting cast of characters with their own personalities and motivations. Definitely one of the best books I've read for Freshmen Lit.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|A simple game that is nicely executed.  Easy to see on the 7&#34; Fire HD.  Quick response and the music is nice.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|i love this classic uno game !!! However you do have to wait in real time after your tokens are up. overall a fun game
B0055SWM08|5.0|Well executed.  Images, music, and game play are all great on the 7&#34; Fire HD.  Starts out simple and builds to extremely complex puzzles.  Loads of fun.
B006C1DH92|5.0|I  have to watch myself because i can play this game for hours and hours. My husband put  a high score on it so im constantly trying to beat it. I dont have anything negative to say about this great game.
B000HEWEDK|5.0|Excellent movie enhanced with lots of bonus features.  Forbidden Planet is the grand daddy of todays blockbuster sci-fi and fantacy movies.
B004YXE438|5.0|If you love puzzles you will love this game. It gives you choices of difficult, easy, and medium  and the puzzle scenes are really nice. I'm waiting for them to do a part two of this game.
B0002I831S|5.0|Excellent set for Star Trek fans.  The original DVD set of the first season.  No enhancements.  Just the orginal, as aired episodes, only they look much better on the DVD.
B006FO3ERQ|3.0|I'm not sure what lessons can be learned from this story. Most people know that stupid people who rob banks will be caught and that their families will suffer for their stupidity.  I searched for a character to like and cheer for, but I did not find one. This was just a sad story about sad people. I can do without more sadness in life.
B00C1BTWV4|5.0|Although it is getting old and the graphics are not up to today's standards, it is still a great movie.
B0076HNMU0|2.0|I know this was a cult classic in its time, just not for me - but I watched the entire season.
B00C1C123E|4.0|It was a good sequal, but I preferred the original.  This was a showcase for Jeff Goldbloom since he did so well in the original, but he is a better supporting actor than a lead actor.
B00DRDVHA4|2.0|What a disapointment he has not came out with a CD in close to nine years and he comes out with a 41 minute cd?  He has enough nerve to call this an album with only ten tracks if anything is nothing more than a extended disk at best.  The album is a rate below what he use to put out, IMO I think he did not put too much effort into this. The man is slipping I think his attitude is that I have made my money I no longer have to put out quality stuff anymore, my fan's will buy anything I put out( even if I farted on the microphone). I can give concerts singing the sang old songs and have the audience sing them for me.<br /><br />This is what happens when you marry J-HOE and become a second fiddle he should have came out with an album during that time instead of riding J-HOE's coat tails.  Maybe the true die hard fans may not like this but hey it is the truth, let's hope that he can redeem himself with a better full length album and we do not have to wait another decade for it.
B008RF0M9O|5.0|They fit as they should. Of course, it's a tight fit and you have to get the top & bottom aligned correctly so the pads are in the right position. Be prepared to do some pulling and tugging as you get them over the headphones. I used a credit card to finish the edges. After over a decade of use they now look like brand new, and they still sound that way, too!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great App!  Gets the job done. Information provided by app is awesome.  A must have for all kindle owners. A good quick reference. on your battery life.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|had me captivated from the first page and has kept me there.  Totally enjoying this very good read love it
B00DFFI7K2|2.0|Don't get me wrong the cast is okay but compared to the first one its just doesn't do at all!!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Best ham I have veered played very challenging and fun. This game is fun because it is not to hard and not to easy pleas summing my review!!!!!!!
B001ECQ6PG|5.0|This was a great buy and is easy to do but can be time consuming. All in all a great buy if you are trying to convert records.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|This app has lots of features. It's easy to use and it's very reliable. I got it as a free app of the day. What morecould you ask for?

The handle was not slippery at all despite not wearing gloves an I was able to keep a good grip on it. After all that I made some feather sticks choking up on the blade. I hammered the knife straight into a big log and and pryed until I broke the log in half. I also hammed in a few nails and it work great because of the weight.<br /><br />Overall outstanding knife
B000FC0SIM|5.0|This book is a departure from King's usual scary or hard-hitting stories. His ability to tell stories is shared in this book. A great read from a great author.

140006922X|5.0|be sure to READ this book before you JUDGE it! I think many are giving low ratings because like Laura Green they have no idea simply because they haven't READ IT. Be your own judge & read it for Gods sake. It is by far the best book I've come across, and I will read it again because once wasn't enough!!! Intriguing & a must read for all religions.

B005GFPZYK|5.0|Nothing here but the ACTION and service seen by one of our MODERN HEROS. Chris wrote his story, and those of the thousands that have spent their youth in the sandbox.<br /><br />Any vets you meet MORE than deserve the best &#34;THANKS&#34; you can give.<br /><br />Chris's story is also a love story - young kids learning and loving each other - separated by war from starting their family...<br /><br />War IS hell - but brave men and women like Chris went out,and CONTINUE to go out to serve - NOT just because some stuffed shirt politician sends them where THEY would NEVER go - but because the TEAM is a TEAM - and each member wants to have his buddy's back.<br /><br />What's it like over there?  Spend some time with Chris...<br /><br />RIP brave warrior...
