B003TSEEDY|5.0|I decided  to reread this book after I saw the movie. The first time I read it was a while ago so I decided to read it again to see if I felt any different. Regardless of whether this is your first or fiftieth time reading this book is an absolutely fantastic novel. The book should be required  of every eighteen year-old, because one can relate to it on so many levels. That being said I would recommend this book  to anyone because it is simply perfect.
B00BHU9BV6|3.0|Misses the depth of the book, especially misses the wisdom of following a path that serves others. Reduces the destructiveness of social roles constrained by gender to individual narcissism and neurosis.  Costumes, scenery, music were very well done and I thought the &#34;theater&#34; setting was imaginative and effective.
B00BHMF578|3.0|I can't agree with the Academy Awards decision. What could have been a fascinating drama of psychological tension was turned into a cliched action drama. Affleck's character was inserted into the movie, the character was actually not in the real event. The CIA would have looked better in a better movie.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Chris Kyle writes a fascinating story about life as a SEAL and as one of the most effective snipers in history. This is both an exciting and entertaining read, and also sobering and serious, given the subject matter, and the terrible conflict we are involved in in the Middle East.<br /><br />For those who are interested in what it takes to be a Seal sniper, Chris Kyle communicates this well, along with a lot of personal information about how he felt through it all. An interesting addition is the contribution of his wife to this story, relating what she went through as Chris pursued his career for our nation.<br /><br />This story is also more poignant given that Chris was recently killed by a fellow veteran that he was trying to assist to return to normal life after combat. One can only wonder what he might have contributed further, had his life not been cut short so unexpectedly.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I had a hard time reading this, I am not sure why, I just couldnt get in tune with the back and forth. So, after reading how amazing this book is, I ordered the Audio version of it. I have never ordered an audio before, I really enjoyed this book. I was worried the voices would be annoying, but it was the total opposite. I highly recomend this book, very good listen. I really enjoy this author, I have read all three of his..or her? new books and this is my favorite.
0738212415|5.0|I haven't drawn since high school (MANY) years ago. This book is just great. It takes you through 30 lessons starting out with simple spheres and moving on.  The text is fun and not too technical and he gets you started right away with drawing.  I highly recommend this book to learn to draw or reacquaint yourself with sketching.  It is definitely worth the money.  I'd like to see him do a part two.
B000HEWEDK|4.0|I saw this movie when I was a child and fell in love with it.  Just had to have it.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|a little slow collecting bits after a while but its not one of those &quot;wait for your energy bar to refill&quot; games. fun game!
B002ZG997M|5.0|As a man who has nearly 500 movies and has seen around double that amount....the book of Eli was still able to amaze me...excellent movie. And if youre a bible thumper you'll like it even more....GREAT movie 6/5 starts (not a typo)!!!
B000MGATTE|5.0|Before i read this novel  the Stand was my all time favorite..  This is by far Stephen Kings best masterpiece..  An excellent read..
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book.  Kept my attention through the book.  Full of action and heart ache.  Can't wait to read the next book!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I loved this game to begin with but...?? The server is very slow. It is hard to connect with the server. I was just award 65 gems/diamonds and they never showed up. I had 71 gems/diamonds and when I started the game was down to 51 of them and also lost almost $2000.<br />It is fun but I would not spend any real money when items disappear.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I recommend this book to everyone that enjoy reading stories taking place in past years, it is exciting and the end is a real shocker, you don't see it coming.  Great book and written well.  Took a couple of chapters to really get into it, but well worth it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|very addictive! Even my 6 year old loves to play this game and is better then I am at it.  much better then the first one!
B009LA1R34|3.0|Too slow and not her usual of fun and dance songs. I am not into duets so it was NOT my taste!
B006LSZECO|3.0|A story full of twists and changes not knowing what direction you were headed... I can say the ending just blew me away... REALLY
B00846F1YW|3.0|This is a fun hidden object game...not much story to it but lots of hidden objects to find. I really like the ho games that have a good story to them but for something to pass the time without too much thought...then this is the game for you.
B005FDXT32|1.0|I was upset that the DVD didn't work at all. I tried several DVD players and game consoles. Not happy at all. Wanted to watch the movie.
1416550550|5.0|This book came highly recommended, so I thought it would be easier to purchase it rather than get it from the library.  I'm glad that I did becasue this book is definitely a re-read!
B00821OX98|5.0|Excellent series, I loved it.  Glad I could watch it one episode after the other instead of waiting week to week!
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|I can't count the number of times I have walked in to my apartment and have been startled by the Zombie head in my living room.  This is very realistic and houses the greatest show on television.
B008Y6WPXC|5.0|Great movie.  Keeps you watching lots of action. Actor were great as always and will recomend this movie to others
B005OYKI1I|5.0|If you like action movies with lots of violence and wild stunts, then this is the movie for you. Awesome car chase scenes and typical shoot-em-up violent action. This film will never win any Academy Awards, but, it's definitely entertaining if you like this type of movie as I do.
B004PR71JC|5.0|I used this CD as background music to a rio themed birthday party. The songs are fun and everyone can dance to them.
B0053O89IS|5.0|This season shows how the relationship changes between Bones and Boothe after the baby is born.  Still a great show.
B007P06DJK|5.0|The interviews-commentarry from all sides of the Apartheid issues were insightful and basiclly show that the making of Graceland & the concerts were a way for the South African musicians to make a niche and also have a platform to speak out about their political standings.  The African Skies DVD has the music & the context of the time.  Paul's taking the studio raw material and working up lyrics that mesh with the music is a special gift.  As the muscians said, music is a form of love that breaks down barriers and brings people together.<br /><br />A good value in many ways
B008S4FZHI|4.0|Another terrific Cornwell thriller- her attention to detail is unsurpassed. My only criticism is that it ended all too quickly. If you enjoy Scarpetta you will enjoy this.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The only thing I have to say is I really hope the women who read this book have a partner they can turn to while ready and put this to good use. WOW!!
B00170MYIS|5.0|This battery gave us lots of extra hours on our camera.  That was really good when we're traveling.  Easy to use and agood price.
030758836X|1.0|I read this on recommendation from a friend..What a mistake.. This is the only book that when I got to the end, I was actually mad I wasted 3 days reading it, even more annoyed at myself for spending money on it.. the end of this book was stupid and I most likely skip the rest of her books.. SO disappointing.
B000B5XOXY|4.0|Yes, very satisfied. Let me know about a digital copy version please. Great to see and have it again. Thank you -<br /><br />Jon
B005HSL626|3.0|Really keeps you on your toes. Fun to play. Really enjoyed playing this game. Looking forward to many more such games.
B003KTMW9K|5.0|The graphics and gameplay of this game have become legendary. INTELLIGENTLY DESIGNED GAME. Story is adult and not dumb neither. It comes with choice of languages including english, plus subtitles on or off in choice of languages, and many customization settings as well for operation. Check out the fantasy books (starting with The Wish) that motivated the software team to craft this great work... not too light, not too dark, gritty yet not macabre, and plenty of interesting characters. It's a single-role RPG, not a MMO or pick your character like, for example, Oblivion. But this is one very interesting character and you develop his abilities as you play. It's not a mindless slash-hack, there's thinking going on. Witcher 1 and Witcher 2 are both great - you can play either one independently of the other in terms of storyline. Runs great on my win 7.
B0076L9W9Q|5.0|There isn't a bad song on this CD.  My favorites are: Here's To Us (drinking song), Rock Show (heavy), I Miss the Misery (heavy), In Your Room (ballad), Beautiful With You (ballad).  If you don't like it after listening to it twice and love it after listening to it 3 plus times you are not a hard rock/metal fan.
B00004Y6OA|4.0|I Love it cause I had not heard this in years. It was cheap, in great shape and I got it promptley as I was told it would be. This a great album/cassette/cd because it really takes you back to 1980 when everybody was so young and full of viger listening to rock and roll,  partying at the park and chasing girls all awhile Eddie VanHalen was tearing up riffs and fills like it was nothing. Yea this album rocks !!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is alot of fun. Collecting coins and prizes. The only downfall is if you run out of coins you have to either wait every 30 seconds for 1. Or if your off line not playing you get up to 40. But it takes a few hours. Other then that its fun.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I got hooked on Dr Who since a kid but I didn't love until Matt Smith. Matt Smith led me back to the most recent Dr's. Great stuff, indeed!
B005HSL626|5.0|All I can really say about this game is that it is so much fun! Absolutely love it!  If you haven't tried it you need too!
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I was disappointed in this DeMille novel as I usually like all his stories.  There was too much talking and not enough action.  The Panther was hardly in the book except at the start and the end.  Could have had more action throughout the novel, and the female part was hardly exciting at all, it was like she was there only for the ride.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I have always loved The Godfather movies. I looked at Hastings and other stores and it would have cost me $35 to $40. I decided to look at Amazon and it was much much cheaper and on blue ray. The quality is great the price and service were awesome and these movies are great classics.If you like mob/gangster movies this is a great one! If you haven't seen them then your missing out. Give yourself a treat and get these!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I liked this book although it was slow to start, but got better as the adventure went along across the ocean.  Very graphic in parts, but interesting also.  I didn't see the movie, but now would like to do so.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This cable works great! I need something to charge my Kindle when I'm on my computer.  Works on my Android phone as well. Definetly worth the money.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, more so than some of Baldacci's other books.  It showed a tender side to a hardened man and his protectiveness to those who needed help.  Great plot with turns and twists to hold the reader's interest.<br /> I highly recommend.
0521653975|5.0|This is a great book not only for those whose English is not their first language. Like every other book from the \\"English Vocabulary\\" series it contains exercises with key and an index. It also includes a good foreword section explaining the strategies for learning, word meanings and how to make the most of this book. Each section of the book is based on a prticular topic such as for instance \\"Relationships - problems\\", \\"British politics\\" or \\"Number: statistics and assessing quantity\\" with an article or a text and some useful explanatory notes and then the exercises section. There are 100 units of vocabulary reference and practice.<br />Obviously a good, at least intermediate level is required but in my opinion people who have a good command of grammar and look forward to enhance their technical vocabulary (business in this instance), especially foreign business students should definitely buy this book.<br />The experience of the Cambridge University Press speaks for itself once again. A brilliant self-study book.
031620157X|5.0|Being a huge fan of Chris Colfer, I was very proud of his first book. He did a wonderful job with it!
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|This has to be one of Washington's best performances. The story is disturbing, yet engaging on such a level that you can't turn away from and have to watch it until the end.
B000V7J82S|5.0|This is a good basic bob marley album. I'd definitely say it needs to be supplemented with some real bob marley albums. But good for just relaxing.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Rewatching some of the last episodes, I'm not entirely surprised Fox cancelled it (given the topics), but it's still a shame this show could not go on. The characters are extremely engaging, and the show is extremely well-paced.
0545265355|5.0|I would totally recommend this to my friends since the story is awesome. Cannot get enough of catnip and her bow.
B008BM9L72|3.0|Getting all three books as one Kindle-book was great.  The first book I think was well written.  The two others were just more of the same and lacked the feeling of being something different from other books.
B001XUPGLY|4.0|I never get tired of watching all the Star Trek movies, this was not my favorite but it was great to watch again!
B00BETX5PS|5.0|This movie is a thriller from beginning to end. Now, this is what I call a good James Bond movie.
B004W1GCNC|4.0|My wife has been getting into the British soaps and has been enjoying them, another favorite of hers is Dowtan Abbey!
B004WJRTXG|5.0|This is another excellent read from Jonathon Tropper an author quite new to me. I had an orgy of reading and went back to back on all his books. I have said before I do not like long descriptions of books one wishes to read so will not bore you with that. However take it on trust he is a entertaining read and well worth the time.
B001QOGYBI|5.0|I saw this movie several times in the theater and finally bought myself a copy. You won't be disappointed. Stop action!! It's nice to see a movie not full of CGI, and all of the actors who did the voices were super-dee-duper.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|It's not to many show that can keep me interested for 10 seasons. I enjoy the way we are still learning about the personal history of the char actors. The season also has interest plots also.
0224087916|3.0|I own all of Irvine Welsh's novels, and this one has been my least favorite so far. It felt long and drawn out. Usually, I can't put a Welsh novel down...
B003B1X80Y|5.0|bought this as a valentines gift. trust me your girl will like it. good for birthdays and stocking stuffers too
B007ZD17XO|5.0|I've played through this game several times and I just go back to the beginning and do it all over.  Well worth the dollar!
B008MIMWOO|5.0|if you like austin powers than this collection is for you. comes in a 3 pack sleeve. i bought mine to keep with out opening. hopefully get money for it in the future
1455523550|5.0|This book had it all for me!  Suspense, romance, family issues!  I read it while on vacation and could hardly put it down.  I was a bit disappointed seeing the movie after reading the book because it did not capture what I thought were important details in the book.  Read it - I highly doubt you will be disappointed!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|The first app that I open each morning and use the most is &quot;Battery HD Pro&quot;. I got this version because  it does tell me more of what is going on and calibrates my kindle fire hd 8.9. I've had this version for 2 weeks with no freezing issues. I bought this app because I needed to find out if I needed to call or send back my new kindle fire hd because of it's battery. Once I calibrated it using the Battery HD Pro, my kindle fire hd battery life has improved a lot.. Get this app. Use it as a comparison tool.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|It was really good and funny how he fell in love with that girl Holly Hills I can't wait to read Diary Of The Wimpy Kid Dog Days.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Great movie!<br />I love the combo pack! Let's me watch in on any device!!!!!!<br />This movie is a must see! And a must love!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|As I close the last page of the book I found my heart going out to both Christian and Ana.  You become so involved in the story that they become like friends to you.  Great read. This is my second time reading this series and it still draws you in.  Thank you E L James for creating such a lovely escape from our world to theirs.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is like temple run but better I think you should get it its just fun but some of the things are bad like the shop some stuff is to much but I still love it
B008476HBM|5.0|Anything by Austen is a must-read and P&P is the best of all.  Her manner of capturing the nuances, foibles, and speech of her characters make them come alive and ensure that this book will continue to be a classic in any era.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best show on TV, keeps you on the edge of your seat. Anyone who like Black Ops Zombies will love this show. So glad AMazon has it
1401937519|5.0|A wonderful book. Takes you through a powerful NDE and its many after effects. Believable because of the inherent honesty of the author. Good data too.  A cancer ridden body heals in 5 days. Must have really shocked the caring physicians. It would be interesting to know how each one dealt with it.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|Awesome<br />It's the entire season, with a really interesting case.<br />Picture quality is great both in<br />So very worth every penny.<br />Resident Evil; for a lighter side ZombieLand.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I think this one is good for keeping the little grey cells exercised. If you have trouble solving spacially based problems this one could help
B008478VE8|5.0|Actually, this is quite a good book and is helpful in understanding the behavior of those other quadrupeds that I must deal with in my daily life.  I am,for example, moved to observe the interactions of my close relatives, the chimpanzees, to gain insight into the best methods of response to those which--or whom, if you prefer--I encounter....the grooming, the territorial displays, the tribal warfare, sexual hierarchy etc.  One of the best self-help sources of the last two centuries.
B00A757EFW|1.0|Hard to navigate pac man around the game board. Pac man seems to go opposite of where you are trying to direct him.
B00BHU9DUK|2.0|The concept of embedding the story within a theater really distracted from the seriousness of the story.  It was beautiful to watch though visually.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|Once you start you better have made sure you have the weekend off; you won't want to stop and once you hit the end you will be popping up to buy the next season!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|The sounds are of a good variety, and it's nice to layer the ambient sounds to match my moods and nightly needs.  I have a white noise machine, but since I found this app, this app is all I use.  I fall asleep so much easier,  and awaken more rested  and with more energy. Highly recommend this app!
0553381709|5.0|The book itself was amazing. The item arrived on time and there are no complaints on their part. The series of books is also my all time favorite series.
B0090SI3ZW|1.0|This  movie was just bad, anyone that liked it needs their head checked for intelligent life. I want my money back, hell I want everyone's money back. Someone needed to say, hey this movie is really, a big festering pile of horse s***.
B00BHMEOP2|5.0|I was on the edge of my seat from the moment the first frame started.  And I knew the ending!
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Let me start by saying I'm not a Denzel fan nor am I a fan of airplanes but we figured we'd give it a go anyway. Like Malcom X Denzel gave a really good performance, for me he usually seems so wooden and like he phoned in his performance for a pay check but not so this time. He really was invested in the character. This was a Denzel screen fest and he chewed up the screen except for the occasional assist from John Goodman.<br /><br />For me the plot seemed a bit far fetched but for the most part Denzel sold it. You could call it The Uglies of Alcoholism. The best part for me was when Denzel was trying to get people, even long time friends to lie for him.<br /><br />Good movie worth another watch.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Can't wait for season 4 to start.  Sad to see Matthew go but wish Dan Stevens the best; Mary too.
B00BESM14U|4.0|Who knew Hermonie could actually act and keep her eyebrows still?<br /><br />This is not your usual teen flick, it deals with some really heavy issues. If your depressed this is not a good movie for you. I liked the plot twists and the acting was really good.<br /><br />I don't remember what the movie is rated but it should be rated mature adult at least 16 and over because of subject matter. Your theme is homosexuality, depression, child molestation, violence but once you get past all that it's a real knee slapper... all kidding aside it has a fair plot and good acting.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|What a great story, but a little far-fetched.  It was compelling reading, though. The plot twists were amazing!  A good read.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|I am a huge movie fan and also very critical of them. so to give 4 stars is a rarity for me. Not a suspenseful movie or a drawn out drama and not too much action. A very different movie to me. A lot of movies have easy plots to figure out and you can see where its going to go. NOT THIS ONE!! They did a wonderful job at creating a story that leads to ???????????????? (I can't give it away!!) Rent it..
B008Y212PI|5.0|this game is fun. I like how challenging it is. I wish it had more puzzles but its sill worth the money. I recommend this game for everyone.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|The Misremembered Man is very sweet, very sad, and very funny.  I enjoyed it thoroughly and recommend it to all.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game Is awesome it is awesome it is awesome I Totally recommend it 7 bucks a little pricey but I recommend it this game is A beast noodle woo woo woo u know It.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|I enjoy all of the Mission Impossible movies, and Ghost Protocol did not disappoint.  The story is fast paced and the ending is surprising.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i love this app. u will love this app. DOWNLOAD IT. this app is awesome. i cannot stop playing it obce i started. download it now. since its free that is not nearly the best part. I LVE IT.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|call of atlantis premium is to much like the original. thought it would be different. like it just the same just wish it was different .
B0037QGS0A|1.0|You would think that if you put two super talented actors and put a twist on a familiar tale of issues with fidelity that you would get a quality film right? Wrong, for a family that's supposed to be falling apart - there's none of the typical explosions or white knuckle tension that accompanies that premise. Both Liam and Julianne feel dangerously anemic in their performances leaving us with Amanda who now has two films with this one that leave me with little confidence in her ability to hold a story together. Too much background music and let's not forget the lackluster chemistry between the two women leaving us with a sex scene that is supposed to be much more intimate then it actually comes off as being. The bottom line is: Unfaithful still holds the ultimate standard as far as I am concerned in movies that tackle infidelity with all of the consequences psychological and physical that go with it. Chloe fails to do this on a grand scale basis.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I got this app for my because I like to do puzzles. It has more than one size for the puzzle pieces. So my preschooler can do a smaller puzzle and my 11 yr old can do a bigger puzzle with more pieces and my husband and I can do a bigger one. This is one app my whole family loves. All three of my kids and my husband and I. We are always downloading new puzzles. There are plenty of free downloadable puzzles along with one's u pay for. So this app is for everyone.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I have to say, as a woman who is also a medieval weapons enthusiast, I've been waiting impatiently for a princess who could kick butt and take names. Merida definitely represents! The soundtrack is brilliant, the animation is top-notch. I love the Scottish accents. Some of the fight scenes might be a little loud and intense for younger kids, though. I would recommend that parents preview the movie if they have any doubts.<br /><br />*slight spoiler*<br /><br />There's no handsome prince (though Merida's suitors are presented like a comedically-horrible round of first dates), and I thought I would miss the romance aspect. But by the middle of the movie I was like &#34;Eh, ain't nobody got time for that-- we've got to fight Mordu and change our fates!!&#34;<br /><br />In short: it's a wonderful adventure, and one that I know I'll be watching over and over again.
B002RI9MZC|5.0|The active life story was engrossing, the picture of aging very touching - great insight into the process of aging.  Written in language so appropriate to the life and times being negotiated.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|I couldn't put it down! A cautionary tale of forbidden love, it left me wanting m o 're immediately. This was a great read.
B008Y6QZ56|4.0|It was a pretty solid flick.  Good fight scenes and a decent story line.  Definitely not an Oscar winning movie, but good for a couple of hours of entertainment.
B00A655N8I|4.0|I have to concur with the other assessments of Gergiev's conducting. The tempi are very similar to Furtwaengler's but without his depth, structural grasp, rhythmic flexibility and intense drama. It most reminded me of Solti's in the Culshaw Ring which was by far his weakest effort in that cycle. And yet there is more life in it than Levine's Fliegende Hollaender, a set with an all-star cast let down by DOA conducting. The orchestra (as with Levine) plays beautifully with ample detail.<br />There is enough here to recommend it because of the stellar cast. Kampe is not quite the possessed, impassioned Sieglinde heard on earlier recordings from the likes of Lotte Lehmann, Leonie Rysanek or Regine Crespin but her singing is lovely. Stemme is a fine Brunnhilde, maybe even a degree warmer than Nilsson,  and Kaufmann and Pape give singing lessons as Siegmund and Wotan, respectively, while fully inhabiting their characters. Pape does find the high Es and Fs a challenge but then so did the later career Friedrich Schorr, and Pape's singing is on that level.  So this set does generate drama. I was moved in all three acts, and Pape's sensitively phrased and legato Farewell wiped me out.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I feel the voice could be much better, not all<br />words sounds are good, can't understand and words missing when person speaks
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Love, love, love this show. It never gets boring and you can sit there and watch it forever. Can't wait for Season 4.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|have not used this much but like what I have done so far while on vacation to find weather behind and where i'm going
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is very fun and awesome! I've had it for 2 or 3 days now, and I gotta tell you; I love it. You wanna just keep on playing another round, and another, and ANOTHER. Great, free app!
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|The wizard of oz is a great classic to just sit down and enjoy, I would recommend this book to any little kid and I'm sure they would love the story!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|It is my first attempt at reading a book on my new Kindle. I find my self reading a few pages every time I have a moment. It is truly and interesting book. I wish I had the characters in front of me and a map like in the hard copy. Sometimes it's hard to follow the characters, but now that I'm 80% of the way through they all came into place. I love the history of the different nations. I will say however, that I have been watching Downton Abbey and I try to put faces on the characters in the book. A little confusing sometime.<br />I can't wait to get into the second.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|If you like Mahjong and similar games, you will LOVE this game! It's awesome! There are different modes so they have variety; You will never get bored :)
B003VIWO9I|5.0|A wonderful tale of coming of age and what it means to come truly into your own. This is the third of a unofficial series and each book  matures with its readers so<br /> expect more adult themes.
B004AGI2L4|2.0|A bit too prefabricated and predictable.  A recycled and hackneyed story.<br />Lacks any charm as a film, watching feels like a drudgery.<br />The real story, without much embellishment would be more refreshing.

B00BB8RKH6|4.0|This was a very good movie - but disturbing! We watched it a few days before having to fly - probably not a good choice on our part. Regardless, Washington was marvelous!  His character elicited awe and contempt all at the same time. I was pulled in.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I'd heard of the 5 LL book from forum postings and it came highly rated.<br />I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />I found the book to be very easy to read, very enjoyable, and most importantly<br />- for me anyway - very helpful in my marriage in better understanding<br />both myself and my wife's perspectives and the things important to<br />each of us.

1616284382|5.0|I met J.B. Kaufman in 2009 at the Buffalo International Film Festival, where he was a special guest promoting his newly released South of the Border. From meeting him personally and reading his work, he strikes me as someone with an earnest appreciation of the medium's history and one of the few able to communicate it through his writing. He told me that while he enjoyed learning everything he did and found South a rewarding experience, he was far more thrilled to start working on his new book about Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.<br /><br />We should all share his enthusiasm. The Fairest One of All: The Making of Walt Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is possibly the most welcome of all Disney Editions in recent years. With access to seemingly endless documentation, Kaufman was able to create a much-needed work: the go-to-book for the most written about and lauded animated feature.<br /><br />Snow White was not one of my favorite Disney features growing up. Its clunkiness and overlong nature were too obvious, and I was swayed by the later features' slicker surfaces and broader comedy. Upon revisiting it several times on actual film, what resonated with me considerably more than the best acting scenes by Bill Tytla and Fred Moore was how convincingly the artists portrayed mood throughout the picture, specifically pure horror. All but a scant few pictures in this genre defy the classification of camp, but for a period of time Disney was able to get under people's skins and emotions like few other filmmakers.<br /><br />There is a lingering problem in the text though, which I also noticed in South of the Border. Kaufman seems to be holding back, balancing positivity and negativity far too evenly. The \\"now it is bad, but there are some virtues\\" template is used far too often for any serious critical discourse to be established, probably exactly what Disney Legal had in mind. It also works in its disfavor when there clearly is a right answer, as with the far too wishy-washy coverage of the color and restoration issues with Snow White over the years. There clearly is a right way to see the film, and that is how Walt Disney delivered it to RKO in 1937. (A frame grab comparing a frame from an original 35mm nitrate to the modern DVD is below, exemplifying how the initial candlelight effect of the cottage interior has been eradicated over the years.) At the very least it should be released in that incarnation some way, let the naysayers say what they will.<br /><br />Even under these conditions, Kaufman plants analyses successfully throughout the text, so that a less enlightened reader might be convinced that the animation in The Goddess of Spring is seriously bad, or that all of the Disney heroines from Cinderella on are unquestionably simpler in conception than Snow White. His fervor for the film is evident on every page. Even the seemingly most mundane aspects about the feature are brought to entertaining life. Kaufman's writing is not condescending, free of academia, and sympathetic to an accurate portrayal of an important period of Disney history.<br /><br />Everything that went into making this film, be it the story meetings, the lectures from Walt, or the sheer labor in actually drawing the thing, makes for some of the most compelling writing on animation ever. Writers try to make the behind-the-scenes stories of other Disney films seem just as intriguing, but they almost never are, most likely because the hard part, actually making a watchable 80-minute cartoon feature, was already accomplished. Everything that followed after was just business as usual for the artists, thus most of the later films were never as compelling, and the studio was just fine with that. Yes, the \\"sincerity\\" remained there for awhile, but it had all but vanished by the turn of the war; certainly it's nonexistent in today's meaning of \\"Disney\\". Whether anyone will actually admit that is unlikely. But Kaufman's book is at least a reminder of the assets when sincerity in filmmaking is actually, well, sincere.ssets when sincerity in filmmaking is actually, well, sincere.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Ending Disappointing<br />Unless there will be sequeal - this ended poorly but was a good read. An unusual story and great characters.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|One of the best books I have read in along time, crazy twist at the end. Interesting and keeps you on the edge of your seat!
B00BHU261S|2.0|Strange what writers chose to focus on. Most of it is shear fantasy. Hitchcock haunted by the idea of Gein? His jealousy over the possibility Alma might be having an affair? No mention of Bernard Herrmann? No mention of the Hitchcock's daughter, who had a role in Psycho? Jessica Biel as Vera Miles????<br />This movie could have been so great.  I give it a 2 only because they did create some scary moments when referencing Gein's crimes and discussing Bloch's book.

They EAT through AAA batteries like no tomorrow.  I have to keep a huge pack on hand just in case.  And now they just get constant crackling and popping that won't go away.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and buy just about anything else out there.  I really wish I had never gotten these.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I bought this on a whim because I was looking to change up my fantasy reading for something a little far fetched but not &#34;so far&#34; that it wasn't relatively possible. What I found was a gem, at an amazing price. A story that combines human strife and desire,  the faults and fruits of our species. A great and binding read.<br /><br />At first I was mad because thought he was gonna whack all my favorite characters I was forming the ol' reader/character relationship with. But I attribute this to his stellar writing, and that is why I cared so much about these people. Still do.<br /><br />Read!

B00BUAEYVK|3.0|\\"A Good Day to Die Hard\\" stars Bruce Willis as wise-cracking NYPD Detective John McClane, the human magnet for trouble. In this movie, McClane takes some personal time to fly to Moscow and find out why his estranged son John Jr. is on trial for murder. He will discover that John Jr. is part of a CIA covert plot to liberate a wealthy political prisoner named Komarov, who may have dirt on a rising Kremlin official.<br /><br />McClane walks into a full-scale assault on a Moscow courthouse by a group of mercenaries, and ends up joing his son and Komarov in a demolitio derby run through the streets, that ends at a CIA safehouse. Father and son will agree, reluctantly, to work together to protect Komarov, only to walk into an ambush at a meeting hosted by Komarov's untrustworthy daughter. Beyond the reach of the CIA, the McClanes carry the fight to Chernobyl (yeah, that Chernobyl) for a final confrontation at a bank vault in the empty city. Between firefights, the McClanes will attempt to patch up their differences.<br /><br />Its fun to Willis as McClane again, but the movie needs a little work. The dialogue is hit or miss, and the on-screen dynamic between Willis and Jai Courtney as his son never really clinks. There is plenty of action, and some humor, but this one for die hard fans of the franchise only.

141694737X|3.0|As a mommy to a little girl, I've become a bit more sensitive.  This book is very cute, but all of the animals sent to the child are male (Lion, he was too fierce.  Camel, he was too grumpy, etc).<br /><br />The book itself is a good quality, just have small issue with the content.
B0012QK7S6|5.0|I had this on vinyl back in the day. I've been slowly adding some music to mp3 format and this album and '90125' were both near the top of my list. I've always enjoyed progressive rock, and Yes is one of my favorite bands. There is not a band song on the album and I enjoy the expanded version, especially the instrumental, 'Amazing Grace'.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I give it two thumbs up!!!!!! An excellent read. It has it all, drama, suspense, love, sex and action. Love  the series. I am looking forward to another series  lime this. This was well written.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|Best war series I have ever seen, especially because they talked to many people from both sides who were still alive at the time of production.  They were there and told their stories, so anyone watching this series couldn't say that some of these events didn't take place, as some do today.
B00BETX5PS|3.0|The movie was very predictable.  I was taking cat naps throughout the movie and that is not a good sign.

B008G59IBI|3.0|\\"Tre!\\" wraps up the ambitious three album rocket ride in Green Day's ambitious experiment. Ambition doesn't always yield greatness, and while Uno! felt like a great start, Dos! and Tre! were let downs. \\"Tre!\\" in particular starts off with a batch of soggy songs that just don't have any kick to them. You really don't get to the good stuff until \\"X-Kid\\" starts blowing down some doors. Then you get a teenage anthem in \\"Sex, Drugs & Violence\\" (which chooses to rhyme with \\"English Math and Science\\"). The best thing here is the segmented \\"Dirty Rotten bastards,\\" which has a feel more like \\"American Idiot\\" than the other albums in the trilogy plus has the added feature of some really nifty bass runs from Mike Dirnt. Finally, there's a Beatlesque string drenched power ballad, \\"The Forgotten.\\" Which isn't bad, but not amazing.<br /><br />There's a key line in \\"X-Kid\\" that's sort of telling.<br />\\"You're not so young,<br />but you're still dumb.<br />You're an X-Kid<br />and you never even got started again.\\"<br /><br />Is this how the band feels about itself? After two of the more successful albums of the past decade, \\"Uno,\\" \\"Dos\\" and \\"Tre\\" feel a lot like the band treading through past glory (and maybe they're waiting for Billy Joe to get out of rehab so they can take these songs out and road rock them), but it feels like the Sandinista Clash. Three albums of sprawl that could have made one condensed kicking single disc, maybe even a double. What they stand as now is a case of overkill.
B009YQJ322|4.0|This movie doesn't take itself seriously and neither should you.  If you want an action movie with lots of killing and gore, then this is the movie for you.  There is a hint of a plot line, but I think that was probably unintended.  We watched this movie because we had heard that it was a pretty good movie for the genre.  And it was.  So if you want to watch a movie without having to figure out a plot and escape into another world full of violence and treachery, then this is the movie for you.  We were in the mood for such a movie and it delivered what we expected.
B007MAET4O|5.0|This is JM at his most honest and most adventurous since Continuum.  In the same way that Continuum was the culmination of the first part of his career, Born and Raised is the benchmark for the next phase of his career.  Plus, the artwork is gorgeous.

Along with them I bought the National Geographic Little Kids First Big Book of Dinosaurs. Whats great about this book is they organize the dinosaurs by size and when comparing to the Schleich dinosaurs the scales are comparable, thus the t-rex is larger than the stegosaurus and so are the colors and features. really amazing. my son recognized his dino's immediately when flipping thru the book, whic hat this stage is more of a picture book but with time he will grow to love it.<br /><br />as a mechanical engineer with an eye for quality, attention to detail and accuracy, i can without hesitation recommend these little creatures. the t-rex lower jaw moves too!

B005GFPZYK|5.0|The book is structured like a day in the life of Chris Kyle as he remembers his pre military days through his eventual discharge.<br /><br />He not only shares his thought but those from his wife, too.<br /><br />Chris was America's most prolific sniper of all time. You have to remember that war is about killing the enemy. Chris did this very efficiently and never shot an innocent. You can't say that about a smart bomb.<br /><br />Its sad because Chris was murdered in real life recently by a fellow vet suffering from PTSD. Chris worked with PTSD victims to try and help them recover.<br /><br />If you like war stories, this is a great book. I thoroughly enjoyed it and was sad when it ended.

B00B7H3OFI|4.0|I really like the sound they have acheived here, but it sounds like something is missing, and that something is the vocals. If Joe Bonamassa didn't want to sing becuase it would sound too much like a Bonamassa album they should have given someone else a chance at the mic. Maybe someone else in the group that has never had that chance to shine or they could discover someone new. I really like the tracks, but it really needs a vocal on most of them.

B001RTSPVY|4.0|THis DVD story line actually has a plot. It keeps you interested for the most part....I only gave it 4 stars because of the langage....pretty raw...but this seems to be the movie trend lately....langage and Drugs....But it is pretty funny at times...The picture quality and sound were fine...I do think it was worth the $...Some other DVDs recommended...Nurse Jackie....get the all seasons at once...just beware it also centers around raw langage and drugs.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I was needlessly terrified of seeing this movie. It is the best movie adaptation of a musical I ever seen.  I come from a family of musicians and have a special place in my heart for the stage adaptations of Les Mis. Those things, combined with my disappointment in what was done with \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" by the movie industry, I was truly afraid to see this film, but I loved it.  I find that most of the people I know who truly loved the stage version or who truly love well performed musical productions love it.<br /><br />The mood of the movie captures the mood of the stage production. The acting is excellent in all areas, and if Crowe's musical talents are lacking, they are made up for by his acting ability.  The set design gives an amazing touch that the stage cannot possibly embrace, without destroying that unique quality that the stage gave the musical.<br /><br />Yes, there are negative reviews. Some from the snobs who feel they should criticize anything that is not the stage production. Some from those who hate all musicals.  Ignore these people. Millions of people who will never have the opportunity to see a quality production of this beautiful musical drama on stage will now know why stage goers love it.
B005HEJFDC|5.0|The particular episode I watched involved Picard being taken over by an alien probe and thru it lives out an entire lifetime on an alien world long since destroyed as it's sun went nova, the episode name escapes me at the moment, but it is one of my favorite episodes.  This is an extremely well written piece, and Patrick Stewart does a great job with the part as well.  Lastly, it is a heartfelt piece showing how a race not capable of saving thier society wants it's memory to live on.  I would have liked to have seen a spin off of this story, perhaps another use or extended use of the probe, perhaps.  Now we have no Star Trek, just a bunch of stupid reality shows.  I used to record every show so I could watch them after college work was done.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|This was a wonderful movie through and through. Very engaging. Very interesting. Very entertaining. Very unique. Almost believable as a true story. Loved it and highly recommend it.
B00AYATBP6|5.0|This is the album of the decade - by the most prolific and amazing musician/artist in progressive music of our time.<br /><br />In summary, a must buy for:<br />1- Steven Wilson, Porcupine Tree, Blackfield, No-Man fans<br />2- Progressive rock fans<br />3- Anybody that loves great quality music with unparalleled quality sound<br /><br />The CD sounds fantastic - uncompressed and beautifully engineered.  Audiophiles should also get the Blu-Ray with the surround high resolution mix and the high resolution 24 bit 96Khz stereo mix.<br /><br />Luminol (12:10).<br />This song has been previewed extensively during Steven Wilson's Grace for Drowning Tour in 2012, and in the recent Blu Ray of his performance in Mexico. The song is about a street musician/performer who spends his life performing and doing what he enjoyed the most in life, but being largely ignored. When he passes away, he comes back as a \\"ghost\\" to play in the same spot he used to, but with the same end result of being again ignored - it did not matter that he was alive or dead.<br />The song has three segments, the first very \\"jazzy\\" and lively with drums, guitars, keyboards, and bass/stick exploding into high tempo. The second part is a very soft interlude with Steve's voice and chorus leading the way interspersed with great flute solos, which tell the story. The third part comes back to the original jazz infused high tempo and great interplay among all instruments/musicians. The introduction to this third piece is highlighted by the original mellotron used by Robert Fripp from the early King Crimson albums, followed by great piano work by Adam Holzman. Marco Minnemann's drumming really shines in the high tempo pieces of the song, bringing a lot of power, improvisation and focus into the song, which clearly brings into light why Steven preferred to use Marco instead of Gavin Harrison in drums in for the past two albums. Gavin is an extraordinary, precise drummer - a true musician that made Porcupine Tree what it was for the last few albums, but for Steven's solo work he chose Marco to add a more jazz oriented, improvisational dimension. Marco hits the drums so hard like there is no tomorrow - and it works! Absolutely complex yet beautiful song<br /><br />Drive Home (7:37)<br />This is the first ballad in the album. Steven's voice has matured to a point where he can actually carry the song beautifully and with great emotion. The song is filled with great textures and layers, especially the lush electronic violin effects, flute and piano. A very long and beautiful electric guitar solo starting from the middle of the song and carries to the end is very special indeed. One of the best guitar solos I've listened to in a long time! Gorgeous song - it could be a single if it wasn't because it is very long and Steven could not care less about singles versus the holistic, concept album, which is more than OK.<br /><br />The Holy Drinker (10:14)<br />This song continues and somewhat steps it up with the lively, jazzy flavor from Luminol. The introduction is a whole chaotic but tasty blend of all the instruments molding together - starting with keybords and effects, flute, drums, bass and flowing into the main groove that tells that story. Marco's drumming again leads the way here through various tempo changes. The middle of the song showcases a great interaction between several keyboard and flute solos. These are again complex but very accessible after a few listens. This is followed by a very soft section where the Holy Drinker goes to hell, where Steve's voice really highlights the emotion very well, aided by great keyboard and howling wolves background sound effects. And after this Nick Beggs (Bass/stick) comes to work along with Marco's violent drumming and great electric guitar riffs that lead to a fantastic head banging finale. The last few seconds of the song accentuates again the howling wolves sound effect. One of my favorites in the album - but it's hard to pick any favorite - all of the songs are so strong!<br /><br />The Pin Drop (5:35)<br />The introduction to this song is led by an acoustic guitar riff and keyboard work reminds me a lot of Pink Floyd's \\"Poles Apart\\" from the Division Bell. This is quickly followed by Steven Wilson's voice expressing great emotion and leading to a faster tempo interplay led by Marco's drumming and Theo Davis saxophone playing, and an awesome guitar solo.<br /><br />The Watchmaker (11:41)<br />The song starts very softly with an acoustic guitar combined with Steven's singing and group's chorus - paralleling the lonely and quite life of the now old Watchmaker. The song continues for a few minutes on with a beautiful arrangement of acoustic guitar, flute, keyboards and voice interplays. At the four minute mark, an acoustic guitar riff introduces a faster tempo, very tasty interlude that slowly brings the other instruments: drums, piano, keyboard flute, mellotron and electric guitar riffs. As this segment ends, a crescendo piano introduces Steven's voice and chorus telling the rest of the story and a secret that the Watchmaker's has held for years that he had killed his wife in the shop and now she's come back to keep him company as a ghost, so nothing really changed for him. At the 9 minute mark Nick Beggs comes to work with a mean, powerful bass solo followed by a chorus/bass stick and drums finale. Absolutely magnificent song!<br /><br />The Raven That Refused to Sing (7:57)<br />The second ballad of the album. The song is about the sad life of an old, lonely man who missed her defunct sister and traps a raven and brings it to his home. He implores the raven to so that it can bring back his sister to life. The very beginning of the song sounds like it could belong in the Storm Corrosion album. Steven Wilson's voice again captures a huge amount of powerful emotion here, like in no other song that I can ever remember. Steven has always been a competent singer with a fairly low key, mellow voice,but I feel that in the past his voice was one more instrument and lyrical support for his instrumentally rich songs. Not anymore. Steven's voice and delivery really carries the song and emotionally involves the listener into the story. Most of the song it's just his voice with piano, keyboard (violin layer effects) and violin. The song however finishes with a beautiful flourish of chorus, violin wall of sound, piano and strong drumming. A great finale to the album of the decade!<br /><br />The songs are absolutely amazing, complex, beautiful and performed with the highest caliber of musicianship.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|Great series, I love the characters and the storylines.  The interaction between Upstairs and Downstairs is very interesting.  There's always something going on, things that make you laugh and cry.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Enjoyed this movie! I don't feel it would win awards, but it was good and has some good laughs in it! Feel the ending could be done better or differently, but overall a good movie.
B000002LFZ|5.0|Shipping was fast and CD arrived in excellent condition.<br /><br />Bought this CD as a spare to carry in my vehicle since I already had one just like it to listen to inside my residence.<br /><br />One of the greatest CD's of all time. So far I have probably worn out 3 of the old casetttes of the &#34;Fleetwood Mac Greatest Hits&#34; through the years I like the songs so much.  Like the music so much this CD was purchased so I would have a second one to just to listen to inside my vehicle.
B002L3ARRU|5.0|The Quality of this Movie was great & The Movie is definitely a Classic :) I watched it on my Kindle HD & on my Samsung s2. Magnificent picture with no interruptions as far as Buffering.
B000VEF6DG|5.0|The product worked great. I will buy this product again in the future. I am very happy with the purchase.
B0060MYM7O|1.0|Only the first two disks are played well, the others are all having trouble reading. It says the format not supported.
1881273156|5.0|The product worked great. I will buy this product again in the future. I am very happy with the purchase.
B0001I561E|5.0|Great quality and only took 3 days to get here. It made a great valentines day present for my girlfriend.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Was told about WD, watched 1st show and spent the entire weekend watching 1,2, and 3 to catch up before Sunday night!! Best show on TV!!!
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|Fun game with nice graphics. Puzzles are fun and not too difficult. I just wish it was longer! The story line leaves room for expansion.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|This has to be one of the greatest parts Denzel Washington has played. He has a way of becoming 100% believable!!!
B00BDNCXTE|5.0|I was impressed with this collection. I saw Jerry around this time, and this CD/download takes be back to that night. Great sound! This is a great reminder of just how good Jerry was. His playing is spellbinding on a great selection of songs with amazing vocals. I expact that fans will love this, but anyone into guitar bands ought to be thrilled. This is as good as it gets; no frills, a guy and a guitar and a great band. I have heard some gripes about the keyboard player and crowd noise, but it is always something. The search for perfection is a hard road. I look forward to many more recordings!
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|It is no wonder this is the top movie of 2012. You sit on the edge of your seat for the entire movie!!
B00136JS12|5.0|Just adding some old tunes to my Ipod. was fast and easy to get this and was crankin in seconds!!
B000NTPDSW|5.0|It's like seeing it for the 1st time. I would reccomend this to everyone who likes these movies! SUPER GREAT
B00122IYJY|5.0|Have th vinyl but needed it on my Ipod. was fast and easy to get here. will buy more and I need
B009EEFTMC|5.0|The classic mode is a great stepping stone to cube attack mode. The classic gets real boring after a while, but the cube attack mode is much more exciting, challenging and fast paced. Loved it!!! Beware addicting!!!
B0044C3RB4|5.0|This is a great show, it caught me with the first episode.  Season 3 has been the best so far!  The show reminds me a little of the X-Files which is another one of my favorites!
B001TCHDPS|5.0|My fancy has been ensnared by Rodriguez  ever since I saw Searching for Sugarman and then ordered both Cold Fact and Coming from Reality. The songs have been working their roots into my being ever since and equally so has Rodriguez, the person...because of his equanimity, charm, soulfulness, humility, gracefulness, graciousness and all of the other attributes we are getting a peek at through his many recent interviews. I agree with the review that Coming from Reality is patchier. Cold Fact is a flat out masterpiece as a whole while Coming from Reality has masterpiece songs ...Cause is reason enough to buy this album ...so is Sandrevan Lullaby-Lifestyles. Listen to Rodriguez's own words when you start comparing him to Dylan. Rodriguez has said it is ludicrous and it is. Dylan has recorded hundreds and I mean hundreds of songs. The depth and breadth of Dylan's talent is unparalleled. But, that doesn't<br />mean that Rodriguez hasn't written a handful of songs that stand up to Dylan's...he has. I think Dylan would embrace Rodriguez wholly and am surprised he didn't play Rodriguez's music on Theme Time Radio Hour! As far as Rodriguez not making it in America...when you apply critical thinking you can see that he is one of more than thousands of artists who for a number or reasons and bad luck didn't. It is beyond comprehension almost that he could be such a star elsewhere and not know it...and not see a penny in royalties...that is the part that throws me to the floor and creates the backdrop to the story. I love Rodriguez's music and will see him in April if all goes well. I also want to say that every song he covers tells me more about the man, too, and he has not made a misstep.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Love the lifestyle psrtvof this app... e.g. it's a good day for hiking... a bad day for sailing and hair frizz.  Very clever. Nice to have the map incorporated. Easy to use. large print so easy to see.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I got this a few months ago it kinda suck but their always updating it to be like the full version. Now it better and gonna keep on getting better.
B002QNTNL6|5.0|just loved this movie. a good movie for teens to watch. not too racey or vulgar like a lot of movies today
B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|The single for this album caught me totally off guard.<br /><br />\\"Closer\\" is an amazing glimpse into the urgency and immediacy that music has the potential to hold (Emotionally/Spiritually/Physically/Etc..)<br /><br />The very SECOND I heard this track, I knew its intention and what it was trying to convey. BTW, I heard it through treble blown speakers with NO bass but still...The accent on \\"typical\\" and \\"physical\\"...It sent a warming sensation/chill down my spine only music can. Did you feel it?<br /><br />I didn't really care for Tegan and Sara before but when I discovered that it was them, but I remember remarking to myself \\"Wow, either Tegan and/or Sara got some awesome production skills in the last few months.\\"<br /><br />Little did I know...Enter Greg Kurstin:<br /><br />I sensed his signature sound even before I could verify it was him.  I had been totally entranced/encapsulated/enveloped in his other projects, not even consciously, with artists such as Marina and the Diamonds and his \\"solo\\" project: The Bird and the Bee<br /><br />For those unsure what I mean, this guy has a hold of musical sensibilities in such a way that I can only dream of. Goodbye, goodbye is an awesome example and exemplifies what I'm talking about...Accessible but completely unique. A few choice seconds of playtime on this track (00.51-00.55) really express his deep understanding of musical sensibility and the understanding to fill in sound as constructively as possible.  Do you hear it?<br /><br />Anyway, I really love this album.<br /><br />That said...A few small critiques:<br /><br />The subject matter is overwhelmingly centered around relationships and the pursuit of Love.<br /><br />Maybe I'm alone on this, but the theme of love and relationships has gotten quite stale. What about those of who want a life that isn't contingent on other people? Not a problem, but let's talk about OTHER things pleeze.<br /><br />4.6 out of 5.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|I typically buy movies when they first come out but because we have been a little low on money I have tried limiting my purchases so i was glad that i waited and bought this for him at a later date because it was such a great buy.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It is fun and addicting it is good for the mind I love it I could play for ten hours straight without getting bored. It really helps in the real world because you have to keep trying to find a solution
1400049628|3.0|Cover arrived with a rip in it.  The books text is fine, it will throw some stupid story lines at you of what creates zombies which you should ignore, but it will give some good pointers on things you should do.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|very helpful during sever weather in our area. up to minute info on where storm was and gave warnings to take cover.
0765325950|2.0|I will keep this short as to not give away the goods like many of the other reviews seem to do.  The end of the series proved to be out of Sanderson's league as his terse writing style doesn't lend itself to the books.  Jordan was flowery and at time over descriptive, but did a great job getting the reader understand what was going on.  There were times in the book and others where Sanderson failed to even explain an important event.  He forced the end to many plot lines within a page or two and some within just a couple of paragraphs.  The last battle could have been spread out over the course of the last 2 books rather than cramming it into one.<br /><br />All in all this was a poor ending to a series that I loved and spent the better part of a decade reading.
B0084U0IEG|2.0|The story is dull and is told in a boring fashion.  Not much to redeem this novel.  I can't imagine why this makes anyone's best seller list.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I find all the G5 games very similar so far but that's ok! Because I enjoy them so much. The challenge is perfect. The mystery is intriguing. I really enjoy them.
B00AEQYM6S|5.0|What a great gift to the world of Opera and more specifically Wagner to have such a great talent recording and performing these works. I believe it will open the Wagner repertoire up to an entirely new audience because he performs them so well. I have loved listening and seeing Jonas Kaufmann since the very 1st CD I bought of him several years ago. This is the best yet. The Wedenconck cycle is pure magic. I had never contemplated a Tenor singing them before. But what passion! Do yourself a favor and get the recording. It's terrific.
B004HXIZVC|5.0|Soundcloud is a great platform for any aspiring artist to get their voice/sound out there. This app is jus ta simple tool/shortcut to make loading soundcloud on your mobile device a little easier. It's been great for helping me get my music out there, without having to tote around an mp3 player, computer, and all the other dead weight I had before.
B001UTW7QU|3.0|Its no DEADWOOD or DEXTER or HOMELAND but it is entertaining. If Walter were not part of the show I would probably not watch it.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|this movie was great.. I thought it was about time travling hit man but than it had a twist I really enjoyed it.
B000ZNRBK4|5.0|I have tried a less expensive alternative lens hood but it was a mistake. It showed up in wide angle shots. The genuine Nikon hood is more expensive but it does the job I want it to do. Great service from provider.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|it lacked Bond action. It was mostly about their past M & Bond. great movie but I perfer more action.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|The opening sequence of the plane going down was great. Five stars for the first five minutes.<br />After the plane crashed so did the movie. Considering this movie stars my favorite actor it had to be really bad to get one star. And it was.<br /><br />This meandering, boring portrayal of a sad, drunk guy was depressing with no redeeming value.<br /><br />Definitely not entertaining at all.  The fake Hollywood psudo \\"redemption\\" court scene was also entirely stupid.<br /><br />There has to be a \\"redemption\\" to sell the script. This one was ridiculous. A functioning alcoholic has an epiphany & in a moment when he could have won his entire life back all of a sudden decides he wants to lose & go to jail for ten years?  Then when in jail says he is now \\"free\\"?  What a pile of manure.<br /><br />Disney meets drug/substance abuse addiction. What a pile of XXXX.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|Ok so I got a history lesson and it was a little far fetched but I being a vampire lover thought it was a good movie and  it kept me entertained..
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Great cast and an interesting premise. Sad it only lasted one season. A fun romp. Something for everyone. Worth your time if you like a mix of space and old western movies.
0984183523|2.0|Easy language and concept but not enough to get you a job offer. There are better books to study for the case interviews.
B002O3Z4QQ|5.0|Excellent mini-series that looks at America's drive to the moon. It focuses on the missions, the building of the LEM, the personal issues faced by the wives of the astronauts and other things you have probably never even considered. If you like that time in history, or are fascinated by the moon you won't be disappointed.
B000NTPDSW|2.0|For one thing, as you watch it, it has this little bar with follower along the bottom which is irritating. Also if you don't finish watching it in one setting, when you go back to finish watching it, instead of starting where you left off, it STARTS OVER AND you have to fast forward it to the place you left off watching. Other than that, picture quality good, but my wife and I wish we had never bought it.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I thought that it was a great game for kids and adults you can run your own town and name it what you want.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|cute for kids and funny for adults! perfect for just hanging out, we watched it twice! love love love this movie
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Much better than Glee! Sweet, uncomplicated story line. Great vocals and up to date songs! Fresh and fun. Will watch again.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Not sure this lives up to the classic 007 formula.  The soundtrack and polish are there, but the story is off just a bit for classic 007.<br />No real suprises.  Grittyer than the standard 007 film.  Some of the scenes were beautifully done, like the casino and the train.  But the bad guy confrontation and the ending, not so much.<br />Overall I liked it.  Just not sure I will remember it as a 007 film.  Worth renting IMO.
B009HNDCC4|2.0|it stopped being funny after season one and two. The repetitive gays/columbian jokes are spent. Need new writers or some changes
B00000163G|5.0|&#34;All Eyez On Me&#34; is the fourth studio album by 2Pac. It was released February 13, 1996 on Death Row Records. A crowning achievment for the great, the legendary, 2Pac. I bought this cd back in 1996 and now in 2013, bought it again. It was then, and STILL IS, one of the BEST, rap albums ever recorded of ALL TIME! A must have for your rap collection.
1452110581|5.0|Just a fun little book full of poems from cats to their human staff member & others. Learn what cats want their favorite pussons to know.
B00A861QMM|1.0|I have played a lot of the G5 games and usually they are tons of fun. This one...not so much. I don't like graphics. The story is a little boring. I just wasn't impressed.
B008HK3XKO|3.0|Looking at picture I can't figure out how to have it sit in lap locked in and not slip forward
1465001107|4.0|I like the pictures.  Michael has better pictures with better lighting.  Overall I like this calendar but I don't love it.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|You might think that a visual novel is not the type of game for you. You might think that it would be dull or not your taste.<br /><br />But you'd be so wrong on so many different levels I cannot even name them for you.<br /><br />This game is phenomenal. A beautifully crafted story, welded together with unique characters. Upon seeing it for the first time I wasn't sure what I was to expect. But I was so wonderfully surprised by all the twists and turns and puzzles and shocks and the absolute BEAUTY of what the story turned into from beginning to end.<br /><br />Every playthrough there is information to be unlocked; pushing you deeper into the story and its characters. The graphics seem simple but the occasional 3D sequences are wonderful and yet eerie. The music is beautiful and jarring when appropriate. Every second spent reading was enjoyable. It was like reading a beautiful book but with music and pictures to follow along. I was completely immersed in the world. I never felt so close to the characters in a book and so connected with what was happening. I was scared, I was heartbroken, I was joyous. I have never been so emotionally haunted by a game before.<br /><br />This game will follow me through my days and for the rest of my life. Top five. Usually I don't like \\"scary\\" games but just the tone and the delivery made me scared at the slightest revelations on screen even if something wasn't actually \\"visually\\" happening. The writing was astounding and engrossing. And... I don't want to spoil anything.<br /><br />Please, just buy this and play this. Play it all the way through. Don't ever skip over anything. Put yourself into this game and you will not regret the experience.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is addictive. Its fun, its fast and was easy to understand the minute I started playing The bright colors look awesome.
B008476HBM|4.0|love story --classic ----All must be read and enjoy the Jane Austin collections. You can also enjoy the movie versions.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game, its awesome, but I need help with something else. k so this review says its by pet park right? I don't no how that happened! does any1 no how 2 change that?
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|VERY ENTERTAINING  MAGGY SMITH IS THE BEST AND SHE IS ON SCREEN ALOT.  i SELDOM WATCH TV BUT GOT HOOKED ON DOWNTON
B003LZ5B7S|5.0|Never watched Doctor Who until recently, and have finished the 1st and 2nd season so far.  I can definitely say that this show is one of my all time favorites already, and can't wait to catch up to the current season.  Unfortunately, Christopher Eccleston (The Doctor from this season) only stays for these 13 episodes... He is awesome, and he seems a lot less of a goof ball that David Tennant.  His reaction to powerful enemies shows a true sense of fear, and we can almost believe for a second that the doctor might actually lose.  Tennant on the other hand seems to lack the ability to display any fear, making the show more of a sci-fi comedy rather than sci-fi drama.  I know I've only seen 2 seasons but these are just my initial thoughts.<br />Anyways, enjoy a great show.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Good show. My husband likes to watch this and he really enjoys the story lines. The show is interesting and entertaining.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|Watching this series with my daughter......it is good from a sci fi standpoint and great from a mystery standpoint!!  Recommended to my friends and they are trying to catch up so we can watch it all together!  Very cool stuff
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|I like this book the more I think about it after I finished it. I am going to read the rest to see where this series goes, but I did find the first part of the book a little slow.  I also have to say that it didn't end they way I had thought it would have, but isn't that the fun of a good book.<br />I have to say that I found the pacing in the book uneven and time got away from me in the end, though since the book is from Lena's point of view and she is head over heels in love.... I guess you can understand how time can become so fluid.
B0085YNML2|5.0|I love this game a lot. Ready for new levels. Are you going to make Munch Time 2 or new levels for the first one?
B003NX76BM|5.0|No more wimpy women!  Nora Roberts has changed with the times and given us strong leading women and no whining!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I finished all three of these books in record time and thoroughly enjoyed each one.  Would love to find another series that is as enthralling.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|A Nelson DeMille fan for years. I look forward to every new book. I wish he wrote more. I hate the wait. This does not disappoint. Detective John Corey doesn't disappoint. He manages to add his usual humor even under the most dire circumstances. Set in Yemen. A place I never have given much thought to. But now I feel like I've been there. Through the writers eyes. True American heart and soul.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Argo was a good movie, however it paled in comparison to Lincoln both in scope, drama, and in the magnitude of historical events.
B007X2JCBG|5.0|Its great to hear both versions of the album.  Brendan O'Brien does a wonderful update to the album bringing out a depth and crunchy feel that the original mixing doesn't have
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book. It was beautifully written to capture the readers attention and keep it. Is definitely recommend it.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|It's like a modern x files. Love the twists in the subplot. I'm hooked. I can't believe I'd never seen this show before
B0000695JO|1.0|I could not watch it because it came from the United Kingdom and is the \\"wrong region\\" for my player. It seems they would not send that DVD to me since they know where I am located.
B0018O4YT0|5.0|I lost my vhs copy and ordered this new copy. I just I didn't realize how much difference the picture quality is between the two. Thank you
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think its amazing because its really great and its sort of like the real one I don't really have the real one but I have seen youtube videos of it
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I went to this concert in Detroit in 1994, was the greatest concert to be at.  I watch this when I'm working out to pass the time and remember to good old days of Floyd!!!! Great sound and visuals...
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoyed this book because it hit on every emotion known to mankind!<br />I don't like writing reviews, so this is it.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|This is a great movie from my childhood. It was delivered on time and in good shape. Now my kids love watching it.
B0077PBPJ6|3.0|We had some difficulty understanding the English accents in the beginning.  But more important, this lovely story is so chopped up, going from the present to the past and back again, that my husband gave up in disgust after saying Who's he?  and I told him it was the main character.  Everyone in this movie is very very thin.  The actors, nonetheless, are beautiful.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|I thought this was great fun. The story was unusual and very engaging. I have read the reviews which stated that this book was badly written ... however it you read it for a bit of escapism it will keep you guessing right to the end.
B000BI0WOA|5.0|mark knopfler - need we say more - fantastic songs, great lyrics, masterful at the whole process. Love his style.
B00422LESO|4.0|I thought it was a good read. I liked the main character and i guessed what was going to happen in the end. I would recommend to people who like Jane Austin and co.
B005K2XUPK|5.0|I had looked through pages and pages of cases for my Nexus 7. There were many ugly faux leather ones and I really didn't like the fancy, but clunky ones that propped up and whatnot.<br /><br />I realized that I just wanted a simple sleeve to tuck my tablet into. After spotting a few envelope styles, I decided to settle on the Timbuk2 one as it was a brand the boy liked and I had admired his Timbuk2 messenger bag, which was of good quality and stylish.<br /><br />I am very happy with my purchase. The sleeve fits perfectly and the material is tough. And it's quite an attractive combination of colors!
B004UJAOLM|5.0|This novel has an unusual quality you can read it over and over. It has wonderful characters to love and to hate and a story line that will keep you guessing, it really is one of a kind.
B000U0O9FM|5.0|A short story riddled with dark introspection into the modern work force. From the everyday blue collar workers to the  corporate machine complex this story approaches society in a critical monstrous tone that is nothing less than a pure page turner.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This book tells the story of true American courage and determination to &#34;do the right thing&#34;. It also reinforces the belief that people cannot be classified by their heritage, color, creed or anything else. A true man is defined by his actions and beliefs, particuarlly in times of stress.<br /><br />God bless all of our soldiers who stand on that wall and say that nothing will harm you, not on their watch.
B005K17RU0|5.0|The AccuWeather for Android gives me the outside temperture on the top of my tablet.  It is current, so I can easily see how to dress for outside.  It also has detailed weather conditions and weather reports.  It does use a lot of space on my storage, but iit is well worth it
B005GIS1WA|1.0|I took my nephews and nieces to see this film during a family vacation. I've felt guilty ever since.<br />This has got to be one of the WORST animated feature I've ever had the misfortune to see. What a stupid story line. especially for children.<br />Every time I heard the word \\"carnival\\" I wanted to throw something at the screen. Yes, it was colorful. But the music was sub par. And what's with the guy in drag?<br />Three out of the six of us who went fell asleep. They were the lucky ones.<br />I wish I could delete this movie from my brain files...
B0054VVRBQ|1.0|Transcend is known for terrible product quality and software support. This is the company from my own country and I don't even trust it!<br />Had to buy it because it's like the only expresscard available out there that supports SDXC.<br />apparently the driver for it was so badly written that now this simply does NOT work on OS X 10.7 or 10.8!<br /> I have a 2011 Macbook Pro 17\\" running OS X 10.8.2. the SD card shows up in finder, but does NOT read or write anything from/to it. And when you try to eject it, it FREEZES! if you try and pull out your card, TA DA! your system CRASHES and REBOOTS! I've had an SD card reader from Transcend and it didn't fail to disappoint, it DIED within months!<br />just stay away from this useless company!

B0067R0APK|5.0|I don't think it matters whether this is the absolute best in weather apps from a scientific point of view. I think it's the best end User app for people who want accurate up to date weather info. This app is very User friendly and gives an accurate out look for what to expect from current or future weather. I live on the Kenai Peninsula AK, where weather changes constantly and yet I have come to rely on the information from this app as it's usually right on the money.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|I really like Denzel Washington and I think he did a wonderful job in this movie.  My husband said he would rate it 8 out of 10.  During the movie he got me wanting him to do the right thing so badly and he just did an excellent job of portraying his character.  I LOVED how it ended.  It was not what I expected but overall I really loved the movie.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|Gave this rating as I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book. It is well written and I enjoyed the entire concept. Will appeal to those who like a touch a magic added to the battle between good and evil.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|The science was first rate, and the story was engaging.  I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good Martian yarn.<br /><br />Rick

B006MW3UZW|5.0|My husband and I both love this series. Masterpiece Classics hit a home run with this program. It is family friendly (we have a 15 year old), entertaining and a decent glimpse into life during WWI in England.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|it is out of this world like really its amazing I could play it all day 24 7 but I wish gems came often but that is the only fla
B0011ZVVOM|4.0|First off it is another solid album from the Black Keys.  In my opinion Black Keys albums get better the more times you listen.  Their albums are the kind you just listen to and don't look for certain songs, you just push play and let it go.  And this is another example of that.  It's raw, gritty, and unfiltered great music.  I only gave it four stars because I believe their isn't as much varieties of style as other albums.  Every song sounds about the same, but it is still very good.  I never listened to any songs before I purchased it, I know who the Black Keys are and that is all I needed.  If you are a Black Keys fan you probably already own it, but if your new to them, give it a listen.  Once you get one of their albums I promise you will get more.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|The Kitchen House is a very good read. The characters are very well drawn and you feel as if you know them  I was very drawn into the story line of the book. I would certainly recommend it
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This was a nice story and good reading before going to sleep.  A happy ever after story depite some hard to read sections.
030758836X|4.0|When beginning this book, I was unsure of what to think about the couple, Amy and Nick, who seemed so unappreciative of each other. On their fifth wedding anniversary, Amy goes missing. With new information constantly being revealed, one is unsure of what to believe. In the middle of the book, a surprising twist changes everyone's perceptions of what is happening in the book!<br />This book is full of mind games and intelligence to an extreme. It definitely makes one think of their different relationships and what their relationships consist of. While the ending is unsuspected, I would recommend this book to anyone who loves unexpected events and endings!
B007IYWY3C|5.0|I absolutely love every minute of this concert. Florence is flawless, there isn't one bad word I could say about this album/DVD. BUY IT.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Started to read these because my grandkids talked about them and parts of the movie had been shot in my hometown.  However, really started to like them and they eventually became page-turners.  Good ending to the story as well as a resonable end to the series.
B002XXLKHY|1.0|This movie is just awful.  Unfunny, unentertaining and a waste of Will Farrell's talent.  It's fine for children under 10 I guess, but anyone with even mildly discerning taste will stop this yawn-fest before it's over.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|One of the better bonds. Daniel Craig has developed into the best bond yet.  Hope they are starting making another movie soon!
B002RPR6DU|5.0|One of Bruce Dern's best movies ever. I think he should have been in the running for an Academy Award. Even though I am not one of the environmental activist nuts, the destruction of the last examples of natural beauty for mankind is criminal, even though overstated in this film.Incidentally, I also enjoyed his Harry Tracy film as well.Other movies he has made were always in supporting roles.Too bad he never got much of a chance to demonstrate his real abilities as shown in this film.
B000S88JTS|5.0|Yes, it is 40 years old, has very outdated machines and shows what is now the wrong way to dress to ride but, Malcom Smith, Steve McQueen and an endless list of other riders show the fun side of riding bikes, which it is all about. Bruce Brown has made what is probably the best documentary ever!  Funny and painful to watch at the same time.
B00BESNKB8|4.0|A combination of martial arts and good old butt kicking. At last straight up action. Great effects. The fight scenes were off the charts.
B003XRELEI|4.0|A very good read, never read anything quite like it. Way too long if you ask me but the first half is great. Then Vonnegut kind of gives you more of the same. Read it and make up your own mind, you are sure to laugh a lot.
B00ADQPB50|5.0|I CANT WAIT TO SEE SEASON 2 ON DVD. I SO LOVE THE FIRST SEASON! IAM SO HOOKED NOW...i think i will watch season one because its was so good!

B0055PGUYU|3.0|The man was weathered but with an upright bearing.  That man was George washington, and he was about to cross the Delaware.  And that's when the real trouble began.<br /><br />This is how it seems like every chapter in this book starts. I'm sure it's a well tested journalist technique to help us relate to the points being made by painting a picture of a real person accomplishing something impressive, but I found it a bit tedious, unilluminating, vaguely patronizing, and frankly skimmed over those parts.  Beyond that, what I was hoping for was more of a collection of current science, such as in \\"The Brain That Changes Itself\\", but it was hard to really tell how well tested and generalizable the ideas were, and how I could relate them to my life when so much of the writing was devoted to the anecdotes.<br /><br />But there were some interesting ideas in the book, and there are a lot of citations.  The main interesting parts to me were 1) The idea of changing a habit by putting a new \\"routine\\" in between the habit \\"trigger\\" and the habit \\"reward\\".  2) The idea that you need to believe in your ability to change for this change to take hold.  3) The idea that \\"keystone habits\\", especially those involving strengthening willpower, can change multiple habits at once. However, I feel like it would be better as a long New Yorker type piece than as a book.<br /><br />Also, a lot of this contained material that was not very new to me even though I'm not too familiar with the area of habit, such as the marshmallow  test, and the material about the gambling addict.  At  times I questioned his identification of certain actions as \\"habits\\" (ie, the CEO who had a \\"habit\\" of trying to get to the root of safety problems).  I guess I would prefer a book written by scientists, so maybe that's just my preference.

B005GFPZYK|4.0|This is a good book, but he could have used a lot more detail. I would recommend this book to anybody.
B0095P3ULC|3.0|I'm not a huge fan of the Transformer franchise but I was bored and it was free through Amazon Prime so I gave it a watch. It was an okay way to kill some time. I won't watch it again and it didn't make me a fan of the franchise but it did a decent job of killing a couple of hours.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Very entertaining, hilarious and ingenious. I couldn't stop reading it. I loved it and would strongly recommend it. &#34;A&#34; plus.
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|This is a great little app. They did a nice job with it and it works well. If you like backgammon then I'd highly recommend it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I have to thank my daughter for introducing me to this wonderful series.  I have throughly enjoyed it and can't wait to see more!
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|The challenges are complex enough to be challenging, but still solvable. It's a neat little time killer. I highly recommend it.
B005S9ELM6|1.0|The film shows the British as cowardly refusing to help the brave Americans with a sneer's on there faces. The reality is that the British at danger to themselves DID HELP. Once again Hollywood lie about the British role in their films, they demonise us so much, and with such relish, In this case they didn't even need too but did it anyway. Goebells would probably be jealous of there methods. What's worrying about this is that people will actually believe this is factually accurate.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is one of the first games I got for my Kindle Fire and I play a round or two of it most nights and there's still more to do. They did a nice job with this app. If you like logic puzzles then this is a good game for you.
B005V2S7FW|5.0|This really helps me keep track of my passwords, plus it has a tendency to speed up filling in forms, etc.
B008JFUTUY|5.0|This is the first time I have rated a purchase.<br />One terrific movie..One terrific human being!!<br />Rodriguez for president! I recommend the CD soundtrack as well. The music will enter your soul.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This product is great.  I use it all the time, if you see an article you like on the internet you can just click the evernote button and it will save it to for latter review.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|As my husband pointed out: It is essentially a night-time soap opera but because it is placed in early 1900's Great Britain it is more high brow. Whatever it is, I love it! And I love the characters and wit (just wish there wasn't so much death, but that's part the allure).
B005I6EVUG|3.0|Looks great and she is happy with it, but I prefer a cover that helps shut down the kindle when you close the cover.  However, she is happy with it and that is all that counts
B005HF0GKC|5.0|Family life interaction can be fun and interesting, medium can be dark so no little ones. Love Joe the hubby..
B0064X7FVE|3.0|The program is fine but in my opinion nothing special.  However, you can't beat the price since it is a free app
B0070Y46UY|1.0|I found this book to be very disappointing at best.  Usually I like to read a book first before I see a movie.  In this case I wish I had just gone to the movie and skipped the book.  Very slow read before finally getting to anything of interest.
098357670X|5.0|Im so pleased!<br />there is so much more detail then i expected!<br />This is going to be so much fun! I can't wait to get started.<br />Thank You!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I read the first 1/3 of the book before the &#34;action&#34; actually started, That surprised me, but because of its philosophical nature, seeking God, that's quite hard to put on film! Having JUST seen the film prior to downloading the book, reading the book was like seeing the movie all over again, hearing Pi's accent, waiting to see how alike or different they were.  Once you have seen the movie, it's not possible to separate the two.  Both very enjoyable.
B0095P31L6|4.0|The viewing of the movie was nice and clear but it did have a few spots that froze.  On my kindle fire that means you have to shut off the kindle then restart it.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Good clean action and suspense.<br />Nice twists and turns throughout.<br />Daniel Craig is definitely the best bond to watch.<br />Would recommend to anyone.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|I recommend Dowton Abbey.  The show has a very good story line, the characters well developed, sets and costumes are great.  Its a show worth watching.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The last book of the trilogy was the best! I really liked the way the characters were worked in and the ending was so unexpected.
B0074YVW1G|5.0|After years of those us quiet types witnessing the emptiest of vessels rising to the top due to their ability to fake it in order to make it, at last there is a book that reveals them for what they are: fakers. A boss once said to me &#34;You're not much of a go-getter are you?&#34;, to which I replied, &#34;Um...&#34;. I was stultified by his rudeness and arrogance. I suppose also he was justified in that I didn't have a ready made comeback. There was also the relative power-differential which would have kicked in had I said something like, &#34;Well at least I am aware of my strengths and my limitations&#34;. This is a powerful book because it successfully inverts the dominant paradigm which states that outgoing people achieve more, when in fact the opposite is mostly true. A recent cartoon in the New Yorker depicts a loud-mouthed go-getter stating to a quietly non-plussed colleague, &#34;With my nothing and your idea, we could be rich!&#34;. This a book that will quietly opens doors and eyes to other possibilities for quiet achievers and unsung heroes everywhere.
B000FA5TTW|3.0|But then I wouldn't say I liked it either.  It's a memorable book and the premise is interesting.  In the beginning I thought it was going to be one of those 'wow' books but somewhere in the middle it kind of lost me and by the end I was just plugging away so I could say I finished it.  I was completely disappointed by the ending- don't want to spoil it, but there are surprises at the end of books/movies that are a payoff, and then there are surprises that you just look at the last page and think...&#34;what??&#34;
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I love it!  Rose is a bit annoying, but I LOVE The Doctor.  I also love getting it on my Kindle Fire HD anytime anywhere (that there is wi-fi available)
0345494997|4.0|I've had this novel on my to read list for years, and when it came up as something to read for my February book club read, I was really excited to finally pick it up.  The basic story is a semi-fictionalized account of the time Mamah Borthwich spends with Frank Lloyd Wright after meeting him when she and her husband at the time, Edwin Cheney, hire Frank to build a new house for them.  The novel starts essentially as Mamah is realizing her attraction to Frank, and from there it follows the story of what both of them ultimately decide to do about their interest in one another.<br /><br />I found this to be a fascinating story, particularly because our main characters are real people so much of the pieces of this book were lifted from the real life scandal.  The author used bits from actual newspaper stories at the time, and I was a little shocked to see just how narrow the view was of a divorced woman in the United States just a century ago.  Sometimes I forget that things have progressed a long way for this country in general, but particularly for women.<br /><br />Mamah came alive for me on the page, and I felt truly connected to her like I was experiencing this struggle myself.  I can only imagine how difficult it would have been for her to make the decision to not only leave her marriage, but unfortunately her children too.  Things were clearly a lot different back then because things would not be this way today, and I felt so badly for Mamah that she was forced into choosing between her happiness with Frank or staying in an unhappy marriage with Edwin just for her children.<br /><br />I know some people, even now, are critical of the choices Mamah made, and I completely understand that.  However, I also understand the urge to find happiness when you know your current situation isn't the one you want.  And I think that's even more understandable considering the timeframe we're reading about here, where women were still largely expected to just marry, have children, and run a household.  This novel takes place during the Women's Movement, the time when women in the US were fighting for the right to vote and have a job, so I can imagine how difficult it would be to stay in an unhappy marriage when you know there's more out there for you.  For that reason alone, while I can't say what I would have done in Mamah's situation, I don't find fault with her either.<br /><br />I'm not good at reading historical fiction without learning, outside of the book, about the characters and what those people were really like.  I essentially spoil these stories for myself, because I'm really curious about what's going to happen.  I've seen some reviews from people saying they were really upset with how the book ended, because they weren't expecting it at all, but I didn't experience this because I had already read about Mamah's fate.  I'm not going to go so far as to say that other people are wrong in how they feel about the ending of this one, but it's not shocking if you have read anything about the actual accounts of this tale.<br /><br />I enjoyed the writing in this, as well as the story, because I do love a good historical fiction piece.  I always find it fascinating to learn something new about a time period and people I didn't know much about before, even if it is a dramatized version of it.  There were a few times I felt like things were a little plodding, but isn't that just what life is?  Life is plodding, so reading about an actual life should have its ups and downs., and run a household.

B0081336FO|5.0|I have watched several versions of Sherlock lately on tv and movies.  This one is my favorite, tho the others are all good too.  I love the interaction between Holmes and Watson.  I also love being able to watch it anytime anywhere (that wi-fi is available) on my Kindle Fire HD.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Is a fun and relaxing game to play. Would recommend to others to play and enjoy. The graphics are really cool.
B000FDVOXO|2.0|recieved my dvd ontime but thuis dvd did not come with metal case,i WANT WHAT I PAYED FOR!!!!! dvd is in good condition but i still want my metal case!!!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was my favorite of the three it kept me interested at every page turn. I highly recommend this book.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I was skeptical of this when it started because I LOVE the BBC Sherlock series and thought this would be a knockoff. It really is a different take on the idea that doesn't (at least in my mind) conflict at all with the BBC version. I love them both and this show is off to a really great start.
1574214276|5.0|I am very impressed with this entangled book. By far I use this book and totally tangled the most. I have introduced my students to zentangled to help with their focus.  So far it is still working and now I use it as a motivational award for them to complete their assignments on time.
B008D28HYS|4.0|I normally do not spend this much on games but I love these puzzles.  I have played every version I could find on the computer (nonograms, picross, griddlers) so I was very excited to find a version for the Kindle Fire.  Works very well on Kindle, a stylus might be helpful especially if you have fat fingers like me.  Overall I am able to play the game with minimal frustration with my finger.  Most problems occur with hitting wrong square when I get in a hurry.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|This show has been one of my favorites since I was a teenager.  The new series is awesome - all the way through to the 11th doctor.
B0016OLC5Q|5.0|Enchanting & filled with life. This story makes you believe once again in the humanity of humans. I was sucked into this film & couldn't get out.
B003DT194G|4.0|got this because a friend raved about it....well if you arent into old -strange westerns then this isnt for you....but i enjoyed it and happy i got it -especially for the price i couldnt not get this!
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|terrible language, slutty, did not watch more than 10 minutes of the film.  No wonder there are no morals in this country. I am sorry I gave this movie any of my money.
B00AOMR2S2|5.0|I loved that it was directly from the movie for most of the songs. Best soundtrack that I have purchased
B00APUQRPC|3.0|Eastwood was good, and it was intertaining.  Shows some of the problems with families and how they get along in life
B00B2V66VS|4.0|it a good game withgood quality buuut&hellip;&hellip; its not always garanteed to open other than tht its awesome! like the fact u can go in to a tunnel:)

B007REV4YI|4.0|I have a special friend in my life that is a 007 fan.  This did it for her.  No doubt this move will be watched more than once.
B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|By far my favorite Tegan and Sara album. They went far and beyond any of my expectations by adopting a new but still seemingly intimate sound that has captured the hearts of their fans worldwide. And its no suprise that they've been featured on talk shows like Ellen. All the songs in this album are capable of topping the charts. Well done Tegan and Sara.
B008XBCJ34|4.0|very good product, no issues with the dvd and it came as brand new product as they promise I`ll recomend them
B00ARA4SLU|1.0|As a fan of Sir Alfred Hitchcock I was looking forward to this movie on Amazon Video on Demand. What a terrible disappointment. Both Sir Anthony Hopkins and Dame Helen Mirren gave vague and detached performances. The lines were all cliches and one-liners, one after the other from the start. The delivery from Hopkins was stilted, unnatural and painful to experience. I turned it off after 20 tortuous minutes.I am glad that I did not pay to see this in a theater and only wasted $3.99.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Wonderful show. Takes Green Arrow in its own direction and makes a lot of sense. Builds up suspense and weaves narratives well. Some complain about lackluster villains, but I've loved them.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I have maybe 50 concert vidoes and this is the one I come back to more than any of the others (along with Springsteen in Barcelona).  I love this!!  Great songs, great sound, great everything!  Highly recommended!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is a lot better than I expected it to be! I really love playing it! I play it more than I play the original temple run! everyone should totally get this app!!!!! ;)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have just started reading and this book, it is hard to put down; a very sexy adventure for all women to read.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|its a pretty good app! I would recommend it but its not one of my top 10 apps! Flow Free does make my top 15 apps though! people should get it! it deffinetly makes me think:)
B008476HBM|5.0|Chivilary and romance all rolled up into a very tantilizing story of sister looking for the right man to sweep them off their feet. Lost romance and misunderstood relationships and how to indure the pain.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Very enjoyable for a Saturday or Sunday afternoon relaxing with a chick flick, you will feel inspired to go out and do something of value
B002AWX6UM|5.0|Although this tragic tale was difficult to actually accept that atrocities like this continue to happen in our present world, Ishmael was successful in placing you in the moment and understanding how he became indoctrinated into the horrors of his reality.  I had the honor of joining him at a UNICEF luncheon in Boston recently. What a remarkable and inspiring young man.  This book should be read by middle schoolers to expose them to life beyond smart phones and face book.
B0059XTUB8|4.0|The sound is a bit wonkie hard to hear but the story is sweet and enjoyable I would recommend it
B005HV6Y84|5.0|I bought this for my girl who has watched the movie many times and loves the music.  She plays it all the time, in the bedroom, in the living room, in the car,...I personally can't wait until it gets retired to the CD rack.  I'm tired of hearing it.  But I bought it for her and she loves it so it's all good.
B00APJLY0Q|4.0|This grandma enjoyed watching it with her 6-year old granddaughter. We saw it in the theater and she asked to see it again at home. She was introduced to new monsters and I got to see old friends (Dracula, Frankenstein, Wolfman, Invisible Man) depicted in a new and fun way. Nice to see that monsters have the same concerns as real folk. Voice actors were chosen well (Adam Sandler, Selena Gomez, Steve Buscemi), they fit their characters so I didn't dwell on who the voices were but who they depicted. Cute with a nice mix of both child and adult humor without being offensive. Nothing too scary for youngsters, a teen appeal and grown-ups will smile. Moved fast, had a heart and of course, a happy ending.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|This is the revamped 2010 version(I watched it on a new panasonic blu-ray dvd player and plasma tv)and thought that the picture quality was very good.I´ve heard some people on here say that the picture quality sucked but I had no problems with my copy.the movie is a classic and can be enjoyed by the whole family(my wife even loved this movie)so I guess if you buy this dvd from amazon you should get the 2010 version(there was a 2008 copy going around and I believe that this copy is the crappy picture quality version)so be carefull where or from whom you buy it from(make sure it´s the 2010 version and you should be alright)enjoy!it´s a funny movie.
B0052AC8C6|4.0|I'm not sure if kids will get all the subtle humor, but there's plenty of slapstick to make them happy too. Johnny Depp is awesome as usual and his voice-over of Rango is an absolute riot. Plenty of slick visual effects and a nice feel good story to keep everyone happy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Be careful! This is not the game to start playing if you have things to do or it's late at night and you really need your sleep! Colorful, fun, and silly- you won't want to quit...
B00992CF6W|5.0|MINECRAFT IS AWSOME IT IS WORTH FIVE STARS BUT ITS NOT AS FUN AS SURVIVAL CRAFT BECAUSE YOU CAN DO WAY MORE THINGS
B00846F1YW|3.0|First off, this game is enjoyable, but not as a Crime Adventure. It has lots of visual puzzles, which mostly involve finding objects on the screen while a clock ticks down. There are also a few scrambled word puzzles, and jigsaw type puzzles. Solving each of these puzzles allows you to see a little more of a story (with many misspelled words). I was hoping for a Nancy Drew type game, where you look for clues that are relevant to the story and help you solve a mystery, but that's not what this game does. The story is incidental to this game and the player has no choices to make or inferences to make. That said, the puzzles are progressively more challenging, and once you stop caring about the story you can have a good time.<br /><br />Pros: exercises your powers of observation and jigsaw puzzle skills<br />Cons: No detective skills needed. Many misspelled words in story.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I like playing all the Mahjong games. Some are more challenging than<br />others. This is one of them. It would be fun for the family.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I really liked this book and I think that everyone should read this book and rate this book and give it 5 stars
B00000K3CK|5.0|great movie and a for the whole family. every american should have a copy of this movie in their collection!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I spend endless time on Pinterest, when I'm at work and its slow this is my go-to spot. There is great information, pics and humor on here. Allows me to create my own boards, and that I love...

1400096936|5.0|I have long been a Don Winslow fan up until SAVAGES  which I didn't like and then followed by KING OF COOL which I felt was a rip-off of ORANGE SUNSHINE - the real history of the Laguna drug trade.  For some reason I hadn't read POWER and when recently did, it was the Don Winslow I had always admired and considered one of the best writers alive.  This book is beyond belief.  That good.  While SAVAGES and COOL seem like first draft  film scripts, DOGS is a book.  Story, plot, everything.  Buy it and start reading when you can devote time to it.  It's a big book and deserves your full attention.  Enjoy.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|I found myself planning more time to read each day!  This book (and the previous two) had a lot of background to build but once it got started into the good stuff, i couldn't put it down.  If you can keep up with the sweedish names, cities and political agencies, it's a fun read.
B009KHBDUU|1.0|The story spent about 30 seconds on the 1700s before jumping to the 1970s.  While there was an exciting scene when the coffin was uncovered, we spent the rest of the film watching Johnny Depp flexing his fingers and walking about an old mansion.  Literally fell asleep and didn't finish the movie.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Excellent read,great American hero! Makes you feel as if you are in Iraq, hunting &#34;savages&#34; Thank God people like Chris are on the right side.
B008KE3960|1.0|This app WAS my favorite tower defense game to play, and I even purchased some of the upgrades in-app.  I figured out a pretty good strategy and played almost every day.  I was really excited to download the latest update at the beginning of 2013!  I was very disappointed when I opened up the game after the changes.  I had amassed over 4500 gears since the previous update and was anxious to see the new aircraft I could acquire.  The answer:  NONE, unless I wanted to spend MORE MONEY in-app!  What could I spend the gears on?  Pre-upgrading the aircraft I already had.  Yes, this is a permanent upgrade, but how dumb is that?  What fun is there in upgrading an aircraft that you've been using for months, and gets upgraded during game play anyways?<br /><br />So, Amazon.com can subsidize the Kindle, but nickel and dimes people on their apps?  Seriously?  I feel like I'm shopping on ITunes!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This story will have any reader going from the beginning to the end & when<br />you think it's the end it's not.  You can't beat Mr. Sparks writing flavored with<br />colorful scenic views.  I loved it.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Yawn. Two dimensional characters trapped between the covers of a book and seeking somewhere to go. This is the essence of FSoG. Promises broken at every turn. An author who leaves the reader as wanting for true release as her hero and heroin.<br />As for me, I'm outta here for good!<br />JiB
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|I see so many little boys that remind me of Tom Sawyer.  Just the look in their eyes and the bounce in their steps.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I have never not finished a book, but there is always a first time, and this was it.  I read all of the Harry Potter books and could not get over how well they were written and how fascinating they were to read.<br />This had so many characters you could not get interested in any of them.  There were too many names and real confusing knowing who was who.<br />I have finished book that I didn't care for but this one was not worth my time.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|The Lucky One is a great read. The story keeps you guessing and the characters are believable. I love the character of Logan and I cheered for him and Beth. The ending is also a pleasant surprise. If you love a good love story, this is one to try.
B007REV4T8|5.0|I have not watched it yet but, i'm sure it will thrill me. Any James Bond movie is always a classic and i'm sure this one will be better than the last one. :)
B00A2H9LK6|3.0|SPOILERS CONTAINED!  There were a lot of fan nods and nice effects.  I especially appreciated the trucker moment where that character was being &#34;released&#34; from the fog, and overall I enjoyed the movie.  But the film had a lot more unexplained issues that could have been fixed with simple, one sentence write ins.<br /><br />Here are a few questions that come to my mind immediately:<br />How did the order send monsters and Vincent to the real world and hire a detective, yet claimed could not leave the Silent Hill nightmare realm?<br />Why did Leonard have the talisman in his chest?  Was he keeping it safe?  Was he a monster before being locked up?  What?!<br />Why did the second half turn Leonard into a monster?<br />If he was dangerous, why did Vincent send Heather in there without warning her?  He was supposedly locked up for being a philosopher type.<br />Why was Vincent sent to the &#34;nurse room&#34; if his mother put out the front that she wanted him to be mentally repaired?<br />Why did the guards try to fight the sound activated nurses at all (which was a cool scene, don't get me wrong, but made no logical sense)?<br />Why did the other guards foam up and die in the mist if it was a hype in their minds?  Vincent and Heather were fine, and Vincent said they &#34;believed&#34; the air was toxic.  Seemed to be more than a belief.<br />Why was Alessa taken out so easily?  Did she want that to happen?<br />Why does it seem unclear whose side Pyramid Head was on?  I always thought he was a deity of the order, but he switched sides at the end.<br />What the heck was going on with Claudia when she turned into a monster?  It referenced back to Leonard without ever explain what was going on there.<br />Why did Vincent have no issue or emotions with his mother dying?<br />Why did we get no information, visuals, or anything about the God they kept talking about?  A photo in a book or chalk drawing would have been courteous!<br />How did Rose and Sharon get trapped in Silent Hill if Alessa said she never wanted Sharon in Silent Hill to begin with?<br />If Travis got released, why wasn't Rose released as well?  If she's dead, fine, but then why let Harry back into the mist?<br />Who was controlling Silent Hill if Alessa and Heather combined?  There was no monster to trap the people any longer, which is what they wanted!  Vincent walked out twice for goodness sake, but Rose couldn't walk out with Sharon?<br /><br />I could not keep straight what monsters belonged to what group.  I get some scenes don't warrant an explanation, like the mannequin monster or pyramid head slashing arms, but there were just too many w-t-f moments that made no sense at all to the story.  These also didn't feel like questions being raised for a future movie or to make viewers think, this felt purely like plot holes that had no thought put behind them.<br /><br />I would have also liked to have seen the redundancies taken out and more explanation put it - we already knew Silent Hill was out there from the first movie, we didn't need 30+ minutes leading in to Heather's nightmares or how she got there.  Personally, I would have arranged the film starting at Heather's dad missing and her asking for help from classmate, Vincent, and let everything else unfold via flashback as the story progressed.  That way we would have gotten a classic Silent Hill vibe, and a lot of audience members would be more surprised that Heather was Sharon and the missing dad was Rose's husband.<br /><br />I thought the first film did such a good job of integrating and answering things from the games (ie, what the sirens were all about, why things were happening) and the ball felt dropped in the sequel.  So many good actors in the film, but such potential wasted from bad writing and directing.
030758836X|3.0|I started off really liking this book.  The writing was decent, story compelling, and characters well-developed.  Even with the first major twist about half way through, I was on board.  I could see the weaving of the mystery and was intrigued.<br /><br />But the further the story went and the more twists that were piled on, the less engaged I was.  I could see the end coming from a mile away and was so disgusted by what I knew was coming.  The last 20 pages or so just left a horrible taste in my mouth and made me feel dirty, like I needed a shower after.<br /><br />While many books sweep you to exotic places you can't wait to see or return to, I hope to never encounter the world of Gone, Girl again.
B006LSZECO|5.0|It keeps you wanting more.  What will happen next, and you think you know, but you do not.  Loved reading this book.  Couldn't put it down.
B009NPM5Y2|4.0|Don't watch this for the storyline, but for the great music performances and the 80's glitter rock ambiance.  The acting is fun to watch...even Russell Brand was able to stay somewhat normal!  A fun flick worth a see.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|All around family fun. Even my wife loved the movie. If the sequel is as good, it will be the start of something vey good. Worth every penny to see in the theaters and to own for home viewing.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|This was an entertaining movie but with the loss of &#34;M&#34; how can there be a real follow-up.  There were lapses in the action and watching an aging Bond could be painful at times but the overall story and the &#34;return to your roots&#34; outcome were well done.  Let's just hope that there aren''t any more because the magic is gone.
B009ZE27US|5.0|I think this is the funniest app around. My daughter  was addicted to this app around Christmas time. She even has the rest of the family fingering up.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Denzel is of course awesome in this movie. It was something definitely different to see him doing. Loved the movie!
1616550414|5.0|Just whished that the special editions were available again at accesible prices but whatever. This price is a bargain. Absolutly worht it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is enjoyable, fun to play and keeps the mind active with<br />trying to figure out all the right moves to keep it flowing.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is an addictive game, however tends to make my kindle a little sluggish at time as the graphics are quite high and takes up a lot of memory. I would also say that gems are quite difficult to get if don't play on it all day.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Cannot wait to see the movie. So much emotion and pure honesty and unconditional love. How did miss this one?

B004SBS8LA|5.0|If I have a complaint about this game it is that I tend to not get things done and just play it all the time.  Very addicting.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|My husband loves the series. great movie, cast and story line. love how the older action actors make cameos in the film and make fun of each other. Simple great action movie
B007FKI9G0|5.0|I want to give this 11 stars but Amazon won't let me.  Worth watching again and again.  So close to reality with a lot of bands that you think it is real.
B0089EHWQE|3.0|*Spoiler alert ahead*<br /><br />I, like a few others am having a very difficult time with how I feel about this book. I purchased it after reading a review that said it was reminicent of The Fault in Our Stars. I loved that novel. I was excited about the possibility of something capturing my heart like that one did. This however is haunting me.<br /><br />Its true that people say a novel that makes you think and sparks debate is still worthwhile. I do agree with that, but this one has seriously only left me depressed.<br /><br />I did not see a love story equal from both sides. I saw striking similarities between Peter and Will. As another reviewer stated: They both were running, though one towards fitness and another towards something tragic. Both were obsessed, and horribly selfish. Dont get me wrong I understand the reasons behind all the decisions made, but that doesnt change the outcome. Will could have potentially damaged her far beyond what the men in the maze did. The fact that he had Money, and family, and incredible medical care, and ultimately love...was not enough? so what about the people who dont have all of that, and experience an equally awful situation. They are just doomed? What a terrible message.<br /><br />Again, I get that people should have their own decisions about their lives, but I felt so vested, and kept waiting for the payoff that never came. I ultimately felt I could have been that much better for never having met these characters. The book has just left me with a hollow hopeless feeling, and I dont think I could ever recommend this to anyone. I am however glad that others have seen the silver lining...I just wish I felt that too...
034580404X|5.0|Great trilogy and could not put the books down.  Read the whole set in one weekend.  I wish the story would continue or I wish the author would write somemore stories.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I purchased this cable with hopes of charging my Kindle Fire with my iPhone 5 in a PowerGen Dual Port USB Wall Charger. This cable works great. Fits tightly with no problems on either side.
B00991TCOG|5.0|It's one you won't regret. Lindsey flawlessly combines elements of classical violin with modern electronic dance music in a manner that allows you to hear both genres for the first time.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this series! Whether or not everything is historically accurate, they protray it superbly. And the house itself is a character that without it the show wouldn't work as well. I love the juxtapositions of the upstairs and belowstairs characters.
B008Q00TRA|5.0|had the most erotic scene that I have seen....interesting concept.  Thouroughly enjoyed the movie.  Hopkins and Pitt were very good.
0670022705|5.0|This wonderful book will appeal to nerds and dilettantes alike. Totally absorbing. A perfect holiday or fireside read, it allows you to dip into it for short sharp snippets of entertaining information.
B003NX6ZDC|5.0|I can't believe that it took me so long to buy this. One drunken night at a crazy jukebox I found Flamingo. I love love this album! Not only is he a amazing front man for the Killers, he can also rock this solo album!
B0098460O4|5.0|What can I say about these two great singers?  Charlotte has a fine soprano voice and Jonathan - well, I could listen forever to him.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Denzel does a great job making you almost feel sorry for not liking his character. Not at all what I expected.
B000N2HBSO|4.0|I enjoyed this book and found it to be well written, insightful and educational. Looking forward now to seeing the movie.
B007TK77QE|1.0|I could not believe that JK Rowling had written this book. It was juvenile, badly written and had no story at all. I kept reading to the end to find out if I had missed the plot.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I had been meaning to purchase this book when I first saw it on TV. Mr. Kyle's murder is a tragic loss to America, but even more so to his family. My thoughts and prayers go out to them. I wish I'd had the honor of meeting him in person and now I guess reading his book is as close as I will get to that.<br /><br />The book itself reads well. You feel like you are there with Chris during his deployments, albeit without the hardships that go with being deployed in combat. He tells a good story and you will enjoy reading his book. You will feel like you know him as you read his thoughts and stories. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in knowing what it might be like to have been there as a sniper. I'm afraid I'm too old to take Chris' advice and enlist to see for myself what it is like to be a SEAL. I guess for me this will have to be the next best thing!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Basic solitaire deal 1 or 3 cards at a time option of dealing a winning hand. Very addicting! I play it nearly every day

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|My whole family plays this game & we all love it. finally got 1set of each prize line saved.... make sure you at least collect . 1 whole set of whistles and don't sell them as this will give you the prizes that fall off the sides
B00BETX5PS|3.0|I was expecting something a little bit more, or better.<br />If you hang in their it gets better.  Daniel Craig is an awesome bond though.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very handy app to have! It keeps a running tab on its history which you can clear if you need or want to.
B00003CXHJ|1.0|One of the worst submarine/war movies I have ever seen.  Historical inaccuracy combined with overacting, bombastic film score and sound effects, and pathetic pandering to submarine cliches.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This Bible app has everything! You can choose any version and even jump between multiple versions to compare the different ways each verse is worded
1574214276|5.0|Basics are reviewed and lots of ideas presented to get your creativity going.<br /><br />I'd recommend this book to anyone wanting to get going with zentangle inspired drawings.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I LOVE SOLITAIRE!!! This is an easy and addicting game!!! I tend to play it nearly every day and multiple times at that!

B002ZB26AO|4.0|The author not only provides an in depth look into a little understood regime but does so with a clear and concise writing style
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very important to me because it is very fun like I am looking forward to note the PLAN to me to me that he is very important to me that the world of culture
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|I guess this was &#34;ok,&#34; but really it was not that funny, and it kind of wore on. If you aren't expecting much its worth a watch I suppose.
1451648537|5.0|Amazing view into them mind of a genius. Isaacson told the journey of the industry which was fascinating. Jobs' understood where technology would lead. He was relentless demanding perfection.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|To be able to watch this unusual story unfold was a real treat.  Helen Hunt was phenomenal as was her co-star. So much of the movie seemed so real- not the usual Hollywood treatment with unbelievable twistas and turns.  I highly recommend it.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I love this game  it's so much fun I can't wait for the updates to get more levels to play !!!!!!!!!!!! Lol love pudding monsters!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|No one does swagger like Denzel and you add to that a uniform and a hat, and it only increases his ability to project consumate arrogance and conceit.  He plays this role to perfecgtion. It would be difficult to imagine who else could pull this role off.
B005FISBTO|5.0|Kept me guessing. twists and turns I was not expecting. Whoever writes this series is brillant. I found myself yelling at the tv and the end of each episode.
B000000TDH|5.0|Its amazing album... the best of No Doubt !!! I hope that A.S.A.P. the record label, can release this album on high quality. The sound its not so loud....need to be improved !!!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fey writes with a witty and smooth voice, creating a book that is not just a pleasure to read because it is laugh-out-loud funny, but because she skillfully weaves her jokes with her personal stories and &#34;Bossypants&#34; managerial insights. I couldn't put it down, and about a week after I finished it, I started reading it again.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I´ve decided to buy this box, because i remember when i was a kid to watch this movie to my daddy. So old day and good memories.... this colletion is essential for sci-movies lovers.
B006LSZECO|2.0|While I did get sucked into the story midway and I can appreciate the unexpected twists and turns, the writing felt like a PG author trying out an adult rhetoric. This novel is bit too hyped up (and in some parts, far fetched), in my opinion.
B00BETX5PS|2.0|And only a minute to download from iTunes.<br />Although I remain a solid Amazon customer and they are refunding the charge for the film, I'll be watching films from iTunes.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|i really like that you can touch any box.  even my fat fingers can touch even the smallest edge of a box.  I don't have to compete if I don't want.  It is fun!
B000HX6DCO|5.0|This movie was great and will be loved by any fan of the TV show. Would not recommend movie for children under the age of seventeen .
B004NOH9LC|2.0|Formula script, cute lead actress, but acting (by all stars) was over the top trying to improve the story line.  It didn't work.
B00BESLHEA|2.0|It was made in some direction as old Kung fu movies. However the story line and fighting scenes were terrible. Sad to say I paid for it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Loved it. What a bitter sweet story of teenage love! Reminded me a whole lot of My Sisters Keeper....the personal life of the sister with cancer.
B0007OASII|5.0|Every song is just amazing, there's lots of pleasant symphonic arrangements, awesome riffs, powerful fast paced songs  like &#34;When the lights are down&#34;, &#34;Black Halo&#34; or &#34;Nothing Ever Dies&#34;. Also there are very emotional moments like the song &#34;Abandoned&#34; or proggressive instants like in &#34;March of Mephisto&#34; and a bit more commercial but very enjoyable songs like The Haunting and &#34;This Pain&#34;. In addition the conceptual structure along with the interludes that give some time to prepare to every next metal bomb gives it an even better note.<br /><br />I really recommend this piece of music to everyone who likes symphonic and power metal because it's mind blowing...its even better than the great predecessor &#34;Epica&#34;. Don't miss it.
B001VNB54A|5.0|If you like American history (or history in general), this is a good series.  It is about the PTO, and shows the battles of Guadalcanal, Peleliu, and Okinawa.  Different to &#34;Band of brothers&#34; as The Pacific does not focus on one particular company.
B00164CM46|5.0|One of those movies that just gets better each time you watch it. Plenty of characters to love and to hate and a great add to any movie collection.<br /><br />Looks amazing on a blu-ray disc as well. Well worth the price tag.
B00881VLCE|1.0|The game was a virus that my kindle fire did not allow me to open and use. so this is not a good app
B009AVCAJ4|5.0|I'll keep it short...<br /><br />I saw this film for the first time over ten years ago and loved it. Great watch for any Anime fan's collection. This film has never looked better and these enhanced visuals only add to the deep story and bloody fight scenes.<br /><br />It's a must a have on blu-ray for any fan of the film and a great buy for any you haven't seen it.<br /><br />Only con is that there are minimal Special Features:<br />Commentary with English subtitles... that's it.<br /><br />Shouldn't stop you from purchasing however.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|My third Ken Follett, and I'm hooked. Utterly engaging books. I read this one deliberately slowly, and lived the First World War life over about a month. Brilliant writing. I loved it.
B00APUQH0W|4.0|The actors in this movie are all very talented and I wanted very much for this to be a 'knock outta the ballpark' (pardon the pun) kinda of movie. It has it's very awkward spots; it has it's almost romantic comedy moments; and more often then not, a very real look at the great Clint Eastwood who is most certainly no spring chicken anymore playing into the overtly rough and tumble character he usually plays, just minus the smoothness to it or the varsity it usually carries in his performance.<br /><br />I would watch it again. I would even buy it and put it on my DVD shelf. Would I watch it often? No. This is a once in a very great while kinda watch; however, well worth a one time look for a one time rental.<br /><br />Pamela J. Olson<br />Citrus Heights, Ca.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|loved the first one, and book 2 hasn't let down. love the series so far, and i will definitely continue to read them.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|This is the third time I've watched this movie; and I gotta tell ya, although I felt it ran a bit long in the tooth towards the end of the first viewing; I now relish the ending and the pure beat down that ensues. Truly, the full embodiment of the Avengers as a child born in the 60's would expect.<br /><br />The characters are allowed to be fully independent while working together within a unit. The affects and directing are beautifully done. The script (does run a bit long towards the end, as I've already posted) is full and rich and doesn't miss much.<br /><br />If you are an Avengers fan, you will no doubt enjoy this movie again and again, just as I did.<br /><br />Pamela J.

B00BHMETKC|5.0|From the very beginning to the complete end this movie kept my attention. Everything from the acting to effects were astounding. I love this movie. Great job Ben Affleck!! Felt like I was back in the 70's. I will watch again.
B008133MDK|5.0|SO GOOD! I love Sherlock... I kind of wish it didn't freeze like it did, but it wasn't terrible and didn't happen very often.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|Wonderful movie!  The visual effects were incredible and the actor who played Pi was wonderful.  To see all the wildlife and the flying fish what a wonderful movie!  I was glad to see the Oscars it won.
B004VYYA2K|3.0|This is a cute inexpensive idea for Barbie storage and playing. It is not super durable though, it is made from thin cardboard. My daughter gets frustrated and pushes the lid on hard to get it to fit and she has pretty much hammered the side panels doing so. But if your child can be gentle (mine can't! lol) and not massacre the box it should hold up. She still loves to play with it though and it is really easy for her to clean up Barbies by herself and store this under her bed.
B009O2XY12|3.0|Kids like it.  But you have to pay attebntion to the bubble color or you lose fast before you realize your gone
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I absolutely love it! It gives me hope, comfort and peace. Dr. A's testimony is very heartwarming and makes me look forward to an amazing afterlife. I believe every word he says. If you read this book with an open mind, it will definitely change your life. I have recommended it to lots of people and have sent it as a gift.
1596434252|5.0|The book is fun and cool.  Kids loved it even more than I did.  Quite unique in its design. Fun!
B005HSL626|1.0|this game is too negative in the sense that shows the destruction of a product. i really think better games can be created.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A fitting end to a magnificent story. Don't let the YA classification keep you from a story good for adults as well!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I loved it.  I thought it was well written and for the most part, had good plot twists.  Scenery and costumes are exquisite.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|I love using this game when I need some mommy veg out time its easy but very fun also. Caution can be addictive :)
B0009S2T0M|5.0|park chan wook is an incredible director, and he does nothing but amaze viewers with this intense film. it grabs you in until you get hit off the seat when plot twists throw your mind for a loop. lady vengeance was also a good film but ORIGINAL non english dubbed OLDBOY IS A MUST OWN DVD for all dvd movie collectors.
0756404746|3.0|I  agree with previous reviewers that this book needed to be edited down extensively. Th book goes on and on and on about parts of Kvothe's life that seem detailed and long. Much of the story is well written, and I found Kvothe and most characters believable and interesting. However, this book seems to follow in the footsteps of so many other bloated fantasy novels. Unfortunately, the follow up book (The Wise Man's fear) is, if anything, even more frustrating in its meandering style.
B005K17RU0|5.0|It keeps me updated on when ever I'm outside or in side..I always use it..love the graphic..it's a keeper..great for everyone to use
B007EECSFA|5.0|My ladies book club loved this read.  Would like to find other novels by written by her. would highly recommend this book.
052118939X|5.0|I was surprise that my order is complete in one day and it is the same thing that i want and expect.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Because of the way this book was written, it was hard to get fully immersed in the story as there was no main character or main story to follow. It did do well to make the reader think of other &#34;Zombie&#34; scenarios that normally would not be imagined, like a sea floor teeming with the undead.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Great writing, great story, an all around amazing book. I have a favorite new author!!!! Can not wait to read her other books.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Just trust me and the other reviewers who gave this a high score. Good concept. Don't waste anymore time reading these reviews, ya hear?
B007KOYEOC|3.0|It,s an entertaining book. There,s not much of a story behind it however its very well written and grabes ones attention.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|So very nice to see a movie based on a book with just enough differences from the book to enjoy both!
B00B10DZQE|4.0|So, yes, this movie version of Jay's life starts out like the Karate Kid, the grouchy older guy teaching the \\"kid\\" all those life lessons complete with the bullies and the messed up Mom, but this movie is more than all this typical stuff. Why? because they somehow managed to capture the spirit of Jay Moriarity, a young man whose smile Johnny Weston, who played him, managed to capture. This is a movie about a nice young man, even the \\"bully\\" is won over (without getting \\"beat\\" up), who went for his dream and made it happen. I've been lucky enough to have actually been to Mavericks as a spectator (2008, and things were pretty crazy), and in the '60's I actually surfed long boards at the Wedge (Newport) and Little Corona right after the quake in Alaska, but those waves I ended up under were nothing to what I saw at Mavericks. I gave this movie 4 stars because the real story of Jay's life and his relationship with Frosty didn't need the whole Karate Kid type angle. No sex, no bad words, no violence, this is a movie about a young man striving for something he really wants to achieve, and yes, the end will leave you with a lump in your throat and maybe tears but watch it with your family. And, then, check out the Mavericks and look up Jay, they still love him in Santa Cruz and Half Moon Bay. Oh, watch out for those sneaker waves, they will get you.
B007W1BLN0|5.0|This move is both exhilarating and full of pathos.  It reflects the deep yearning in many of us to reconnect to Mother Nature.  I also read the book and think they could have done a better job in showing influences that lead the main character to make the choices he did.  But I still loved it.
B001E25MBK|5.0|This was really the perfect Birthday gift, in my opinion one of the best movies ever made I will get plenty of use out of this set, Thanks Dan!
B0049J3QNG|4.0|We have two little ones...2 and 4. I felt Toy Story 2 was by far the best one for them...entertaining, laugh-out-loud, just 'scary' enough for them. We loved 1 and 3, but (at least for my kids) some images were a little too intense for them.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|A bit glitchy at times. Other than that i like it. Wish we could've chosen the horses name. Or chosen what color the horse was.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|I loved this one a lot. This was an 'Edge of your seat' action movie I would watch again and again.
0307730697|5.0|What a story, good to motivate people..learn how to overcome obstacles in your life, and put into perspective, and what commitment really means
1423136802|5.0|Just as described!  Five books...all in one convenient box!  With artwork on the outside!  Just wonderful!  Also, the actual books are very good.
B005J7K950|5.0|When it was released, Moroder attempted to fill in the missing gaps the best it could. He also added a great soundtrack by Moroder featuring many great artists that accompanied the vintage movie perfectly. Twenty years later the music does not seem dated.<br />Since entire segments of the movie were missing, he edited the film to be as close to the original story as you could at the time. Now with the newly found and restored version the movie makes even more sense. But I hope Moroder may consider revamping his edition as he seemed to care so much about the movie and the movie's score and make his edition a companion, not a competition to the original movie with it's own artistic merits.<br />But even with 'now' missing footage, Moroder's version with it's colored tinted scenes, and explanations to missing scenes and certainly the music he's written will continue to be a masterpiece of it's own.
B0079R8KO0|5.0|Bought a cover at a dept. store.  Was not all that.  Returned it and got this one.  For the price is does what it needs to do.  I am very happy with it!!!
B001NY4X4G|5.0|One of my favorite movies. Quite the twist at the end...can't wait to rewatch it! Besides...who doesn't want to look at Richard Gere?
B009A87Z6U|1.0|I ordered this movie on blu ray, and it was defective when it arrived. Amazon quickly shipped a replacement which was also defective. Neither would play in my blu ray player. Other blu ray discs, included one ordered at the same time played fine, so it was not an issue with the player.  Amazon has been excellent about taking the returns, however, it appears they may ave received a defective batch.
1401223176|5.0|Excellent story line involving many of the batman's villains and some of his allies. The artwork is fantastic as well, you will not be disappointed.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I feel like this book has greatly helped me understand myself. I am trying to determine my husband's love language still however I am willing to do the 6 month experiment to find out. If there is something he wants me to do that will make me a better wife in his eyes I will do it. I have wondered for some time now if I should go to marriage counseling... it's expensive. When a friend of mine told me about this book I thought \\"why not?\\" Now I am glad I bought it and plan to pass this information along. I also plan on buying the one for children. I want to have a close and loving relationship with my children. I want to be the best mother possible. I think it will help in that area as well. Thank you.
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|awesome movie, im not really into drama movies but this one totally blew me away the ending was probaly the best part about it, don't want to be a spoiler just buy it and watch it!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this app is really cool. I like it a lot for my lil sis. she likes it a lot too
030758836X|3.0|I wanted to love this book. I was so taken in by the beginning, it was perfect. Two parallel narratives of two characters you could almost like, but found yourself waivering. It felt like reading Daphne DuMaurier's \\"Rebecca\\" all over again, the suspicious husband and the perfect wife everyone loved. It could have been a great story with an ambiguous ending that stuck with you forever, but the author went in a direction, that while interesting, was not the mindblowing psychological thriller it had been made out to be.<br /><br />All and all it is a good read, that will keep you hooked until the ending, but this is my problem in general with Gillian Flynn. She is a great writer, she is engaging and sets up a wonderful atmosphere of suspense, but her execution always falls short at the end. She had a wonderful idea that seemed to get convoluted in the process of trying to make some deep psychological point.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an awesome game! I really love it! It is very iddicting! I love to play it on trips and when I am bored
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This book was a much welcome improvement over the fourth volume in the series. If you enjoyed books 1-3, there is no reason you won't enjoy this one!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|A lot of challenges,could have a counter for each goals.  Could be updated!  sometimes gets stuck!  Overall a fun game!

B007VUA7VO|5.0|This application is very helpful in giving the remaining battery life. I always check it when I turn on or am ready to turn off my Kindle. It's large size makes it easy to see. The free offer was even better! I use this every day..R.Lyle
B00A7ZWUJC|1.0|Not her best album thats for sure. I REALLY DONT LIKE HER NEW STYLE PERSONALLY AND MUSICALLY. Go back to making hits please!
B007FEZQF8|5.0|This book is great, it's way better than I would've guessed and I would totally recommend buying this book and the rest of the series.

B004SOR4H6|1.0|but generally a waste of time.  I find little of relevance to my daily life and I'm discerning in who/what I follow.  Bothered by intrusions from those in whom I have NO interest.
B0081JA34U|4.0|I read the reviews before I bought the Album the biggest complaint is that this isn't Garbage's normal sound. I like that it's a good change in their style I don't think it's too far off what they've done. If you have eclectic taste this album won't make you blink an eye.  Change is good and I'm glad to see the music grow with the band.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|A bit ironic to be reading about the man who created Apple on an Adroid product but that only makes it that much more delicious (as Apples should be).  Isaacson paints a compelling picture of an enigmatic genius.  Can't get enough of it.  Perturbed that Kindle lose my highlighting and bookmark at one juncture but that's another price one pays for reading ebooks.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|Really awesome animation. Defiantly recommend playing Final Fantasy VII first because you will have no idea whats going on otherwise.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|I really liked this app, at first. But then it had lots of problems loading. I would have to keep restarting my kindle to get it to load and after 2 days of having this app, it used half of my data for the entire month! If they can fix these problems I would try it again, but it's not worth the data overage fees.
1616550414|4.0|Defiantly recommended to any The Legend of Zelda fans! Very colorful and full of detail with tons of beautiful illustrations!
B007VTVGAQ|5.0|Fiona Apple is a bit of an acquired taste, but she's got a great voice and she always keeps her music interesting. I love this album.
B0071LLHGC|5.0|Another live performance that has its unique touches to their standards.  A must have for your collection is this arrangement of favorites
B00AU15HPC|3.0|A few small comments which are all opinions - buy this to experience it yourself!  I listened to this a few times and couldn't help but group it in (mostly) 3 song increments -<br /><br />1 -Opens with three terrific songs that make you think this could be the best Hayward album ever.  No, this isn't the Moodies on this album but it reminds you of many of the past Hayward solo albums but most particularly View from the Hill.<br /><br />2 - Eastern Sun is a pleasant acoustic song, On the Road contains some nice chorus work and is better with the instrumental than vocal, and Lazy is as its name suggests - a wandering song that in my mind goes nowhere<br /><br />3 - In the Beginning to me flounders without direction, It's Cold is a bluegrass version of the earlier Moody version and you will either like it or not (me not), What you Resist shows you what bluegrass might be without the Moodies (didn't care for it), and Bluegrass continues the theme.  Listen, you'll either like this or not, but I suspect most people would have rather Justin gone down a different road than this but he has the right to do what he wants and maybe this will grow on me<br /><br />4 - Captivated picks up where the first three ended up but doesn't quite measure up, One Day repeats in a glorious extended version, Rising needs a good Edge poem, and the music ends with two really odd choices - an odd remix version of an earlier MB hit, and a jarring extended play version meant for clubs (?) - pls see below!<br /><br />In short, this is a VERY indifferent experience - I loved four to five songs, not so much the rest, but now that we mostly view albums less as collected works than good songs and bad, having 4 or 5 great tunes from Justin Hayward makes my day.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Wondering about those last three songs on the album?  Here:  (oh, and if you get the CD, Rising merges into the next - sorry digital download people)<br /><br />P.S.  - From an interview on the JH website:<br /><br />NICK DERISO: Let's start with the new remix of 1988's \\"I Know You're Out There Somewhere.\\" What was your initial reaction to hearing one of your more popular songs reassembled in that way?<br /><br />JUSTIN HAYWARD: It came completely out of the blue. There were a couple of Swedish boys, and their manager sent this stuff through. They were loved the song, and they wanted to do a dance version of the song, but they found that they couldn't extract what they wanted from the Moody Blues record. Really, they just wanted my voice, a bit of my old DX7 (an 1980s-era Yamaha synthesizer), and some percussion things. So, I listened to it, and I really enjoyed the stuff that they had started to put together. That dance stuff is kind of organic; you can come back the next day, and it would sound a little bit different. They asked me if I could do these pieces, and they sent me some tracks where they wanted things put, and I agreed. I enjoyed it immensely.<br /><br />NICK DERISO: How did it end up on Spirits of the Western Sky?<br /><br />JUSTIN HAYWARD: I never thought much more about it, except that I assumed it would be in clubs. But then when we were doing my album, Alberto, my engineer, and I would find that at the end of the night, we would put one of the guys' new versions of \\"I Know You're Out There Somewhere\\" on -- and dance around the studio, and be happy. (Laughs.) It helped release a lot of the tension that we'd built up. We just got to enjoy it. And when we were compiling the album, we both decided that we really wanted to include it. It had become such a part of the album, such a part of our lives when we were making the album, that we wanted to include it.<br /><br />My comment - looked at this way, I'm glad he included it!
034580404X|3.0|The first book was interesting, but the second book quickly became boring ans I have not resumed reading it in a month.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|This was my first year actually seeing this movie in its entirety.  When I told my husband I wanted to purchase it, he wanted it in color while I wanted it in B&W.  With this set we are both happy!
B00AE1P8UM|5.0|This really helps one towards a positive outcome in life.  The author uses quotes and different scenerios to hit the message home
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is so fun. It is just like tempel run but better. For exampel it is way more coloerful and way more fun. After I got this app I deleted tempel run.  : )
B007WFTFG6|3.0|My 2 yr old loves to color and use this app, but it's very irritating when you click on something and it tries to charge you for it. I would recommend it, but be very careful about clicking on things because it will try to charge you for it!
B000W453KQ|5.0|I love this movie for many reasons, i.e. the soundtrack, the perfect casting, the compelling acting, and the story. Spanning the 1930s and 1950s the movie explores the turbulent relationship between activist Katie (Barbra Streisand) and writer Hubbell (Robert Redford). Streisand delivers a great cinematic performance (I also loved her in \\"Yentl\\" and \\"Funny Girl\\"), portraying a woman who is fiercely devoted to her political beliefs, beginning with her college years, where she meets Hubbell, a jock who moves around in a circle very different from Katie's. Yet their mutual affinity for writing draws them together, and after the war, Katie meets Hubbell and the pair are drawn into a relationship.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the relationship suffers because of Katie's high expectations of Hubbell. Hubbell is content to just coast through life, taking his achievements in stride. He wrote one book which did not make it big, yet he is content, picking up other writing assignments. This disappoints Katie, because she feels Hubbell is capable of so much more, placing him on a pedestal which Hubbell finds hard to live up to. Their story is heartbreaking because they love each other fiercely, yet their aspirations in life and what they desire out of life is so different that it tears them apart.<br /><br />I love the scenes where Hubbell and Katie interact with each other - whether it is a loving encounter, or a tension-filled one where Katie laments Hubbell's lack of aspiration or finds fault with his friends. There's a scene where on the verge of breaking up, Katie tells Hubbell,  \\"You'll never find anyone who's as good for you as I am to believe in you as much as I do or love you as much.\\"  Hubbel responds:\\"I know that Katie\\" It was an insightful moment that encapsulated their relationship so well.<br /><br />The final scene where Katie and Hubbell embrace each other shows how much they still love each other and to me, this movie will always remain one of the great love stories. One may not always end up with one's greatest love, but the memories of that love will always endure.s. One may not always end up with one's greatest love, but the memories of that love will always endure.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Could not put it down.  Really enjoyed the book.  It was odd reading about teenagers, and it was somewhat predictable, but I loved it!
0440178002|3.0|Such a great scoping story, great characters, masterful intrigue and build up and unraveling then it just ends. He wraps up \\"the battle\\" with two lines.  Did they run out of time?...    You will love this book and hard to put it down, then it just ends...he does not even become Shogun in the book...it's just assumed it will happen later on.    This book could have easily added a sequel to tie up actually going to war and winning the war, alliances made and broken, and actually becoming the Shogun as well as Blackthorne actually doing something with his future, ship, personal war with priests and spanish, etc besides being a permanent lackey.  So to that end I was extremely dissappointed...felt like I read half of a amazing book with no second half...real shame...
B004SKLFJS|1.0|I got a broken product and have to pay to send it back. Sounds good, right?<br />I must not purchase any products like that in here again, your service is so bad.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|The story line and pacing of &#34;Skyfall&#34; left me uninspired. &#34;Quantum of Solace&#34; was better and even that was far below most Bond adventures. The producers have in Craig a fine actor capable of expressing a more believable better rounded hero. Gone are the flippant arrogant lines that were supposed to be comedic and the gadget laden agent. This Bond has to rely on guts and and his own resourcefulness most of the time.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert: An ex-MI6 agent gets his revenge. While cyber criminals are contemporary, on the whole I kept looking at my watch. The Craig era Bond films  reflect today's world as they should. This project was in trouble from the start since it was due out at least a year earlier. The script was poorly written and the editing of it and the raw film could have saved the film, but it didn't.<br /><br />If you are a Daniel Craig fan, as I am; you have to watch it whether it measures up or not. One highlight was the re-introduction of Q. This kid seems to fit the Bond of today while respecting the integrity of that character. The action sequences were nearly up to par as well.<br /><br />Craig's Bond established in &#34;Casino Royale&#34; was refreshing and more compelling, resulting in one of the best Bond films to date.<br />It reminded me in part of &#34;Licence to Kill&#34; with Dalten, who unfortunately still had to say those pesky low comedy one-liners left over from the Moore interpretation. Craig's  portrayal brought new life into the character that was sorely needed by the franchise. Vulnerable but incredibly tough plays believably as the familiar character must use all of his energy to save the day. Hopefully the next one will be more on par with &#34;Casino Royale&#34;.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|but then the graphics would become block-y. and then I was eventually unable to even PLAY the game. redownloaded it: same resaults

B00136NUG6|5.0|This is a good collection of songs for someone just getting into EWF. It includes their most well known hits and has a great flow from beginning to end.
B00AFEXRME|2.0|here's a certain wobble to Denzel Washington's chin that starts to appear when he's getting emotional. He sucks it in, he juts it out. With most actors, their eyes let you know when they're feeling deeply. For Washington, it's his chin. And in \\"Flight,\\" for which he earned his sixth Academy Award nomination, Washington's chin works overtime.<br /><br />As Whip Whitaker, a cocksure but troubled pilot who wakes up to naked flight attendants, lines of cocaine and angry calls from his ex-wife before heading to the airport to get behind the controls of an airplane, Washington's chin seeks not only to convince those around him, but, ever so subtly, to convince himself of his strength and reliability.<br /><br />But when the flight equipment goes wonky on what should be a straightforward 52-minute stint from Orlando to Atlanta, Whitaker must seize control of both his own mind and his plane. With help from his mustachioed copilot (Brian Geraghty) and the head flight attendant, Whitaker pulls some daring steering stunts (beautifully and brutally executed by director Robert Zemeckis) and crash-lands the plane in a field, sparing the majority of those on-board a terrible death.<br /><br />Alas, Whip Whitaker is no Sully Sullenberger, and despite his seemingly heroic efforts, his toxicology report reveals unconscionable levels of intoxicants in his system, raising new questions. Was this crash due to equipment failure or human failure? And how much does it really matter? More importantly, how much can be proven?<br /><br />A big-shot lawyer from Chicago (played with a detached intensity by Don Cheadle) is sent in to protect Whitaker (and the pilot's union) from a damaging trial. Let the behind-the-scenes cover-up begin.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Whitaker meets a stunning junkie (played with a nice mix of grit and brokenness by Kelly Reilly) and is in the right place at the right time often enough (twice) to have her move in with him and provide him with attention, connection and a clear example of the redemptive power of self-rehabilitation.<br /><br />Along with composer Alan Silvestri's rich score, the film's weightier themes attempt to mask the heavy-handedness of it all, but the kind of deep-seated serendipity Zemeckis hooks into in films like \\"Forrest Gump,\\" \\"Cast Away\\" and even the \\"Back to the Future\\" trilogy feels too obvious here, as screenwriter John Gatins blatantly lays out our hero's path to destruction (and possible redemption) while slathering on the religious undertones.<br /><br />\\"The way you landed that lane was nothing short of a miracle,\\" says one breathless friend. \\"God landed that plane,\\" declares another. A chain-smoking cancer patient, more plot device than actual character, appears in a hospital stairway and solemnly intones \\"You're a stupid *&%#@! if you don't believe in God.\\" For you-know-who's sake, the wing of the plane takes out the steeple of a church before crashing in a field as a group of believers are praying.<br />By the time \\"an act of God\\" has been declared as one of the probable causes of the plane crash we get the point. God's doing his very best to look out for Whip Whitaker, to warn him towards the straight and narrow. The \\"Big Book\\" of Alcoholics Anonymous lays it out fairly succinctly:<br /><br />\\"The alcoholic at certain times has no effective mental defense against the first drink... neither he nor any other human being can provide such a defense. His defense must come from a Higher Power.\\"<br /><br />All this set-up means that when Whitaker angrily claims \\"I choose to drink,\\" we know it's not true. He must drink. He must drink until he can face himself and face this higher power that is monkeying with his flight equipment, sacrificing innocent passengers and setting him up with hot heroin addicts. But why is that more interesting than a functioning alcoholic who actually does choose to drink? Wouldn't a twisted man who crashes a plane, sobers up enough for a phony, finagled trial and then goes unhappily on his way be fascinating?<br /><br />Gatins carefully carves a path from action-thriller to detective drama to character study and Washington tears admirably through all of it, his wobbly chin lending gravitas to every scene. Sure it's nice that there's a story of redemption deep down at the heart of this fast-paced and engaging film, but it feels a bit unnecessary. Not everybody needs to be saved.nhappily on his way be fascinating?<br /><br />Gatins carefully carves a path from action-thriller to detective drama to character study and Washington tears admirably through all of it, his wobbly chin lending gravitas to every scene.

0385341008|5.0|I literally cried my way through the second half of this book. What a beautiful story. And the way it's written makes the characters so accessible and real. I think more books should be written in letter form &lt;3 Everyone should experience the loveliness of this book!
B0027MJU00|5.0|This was a great book. Very twisted at times. Definitely didn't see that ending coming. I would love if there was a sequel.
1616550414|5.0|If your a big Zelda fan like me you'll love this book. Tons of concept art, interviews with the developers, an unreleased Zelda comic, and my personal favorite the chronology of the Zelda games.
B005N09L5C|2.0|didnt like ti, to heavy and wasnt intertained. To long story wish that is would end take it off i every watched ti
B006ZCWTZG|5.0|Very much a Bruce Springsteen fan.  In my opinion this is the best album since the Rising.  Not that he makes bad albums....<br /><br />Once again very relevant to the times, and I am sure will be relevant for many years to come as is all his work
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Downton Abbey is as addictive as chocolate and just as enjoyable.  Buy it! And then be prepared to agonize until the 4th season is released.
B008JFQKMA|2.0|Just didnt like the album, not even considering the 2nd two releases.<br /><br />So much better Green Day in my opinion from their past
B0022W6L6G|1.0|As soon as I downloaded it I went to play it and every song had parts that skipped and jumped.  I felt like I was back in the 70's listening to my record album on a dusty record.  Unless they can fix this, don't buy it.
B000V9KFM8|5.0|I am a huge Springsteen fan.<br /><br />His music is always good.  Great story teller paralleling the average persons lives.  His words have meaning and a purpose
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|They did a remarkable job filming an \\"unfilmable\\" book.  The decision not to do each time period as a unit, but to jump between them, was a risky one, but it worked, in part because the transitions they chose were really well thought-out.  Good acting and a nice job of capturing the book.  This one got robbed at Oscar time.
B000FU7ERW|5.0|Huge Led Zeppelin fan, and they did not release a bad album in my opinion.  This one is probably my 2nd favorite next to Zepp I
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I liked the book very much.  Very suspenseful and gave me an insight to what some battered wives must put up with until they finally find the courage to remove themselves from the situation even though it is such a scary move for them and it proves that they can find happiness after all.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|Just okay, not as great as I expected.  Story is good but it sort of drug on a bit in my opinion.<br /><br />Worth reading if you looking for a book to read in general.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|I enjoy this style of music and the artist's presentation of the music. The CD is certainly worth the cost.
B000OLK064|5.0|Another Classic Springsteen!<br /><br />This is the vinyl copy and sound quality is good considering its age.  Great double album with once again great stories behind the songs.  Overall this is a close 2nd to my favorite Bruce.  1) Darkness, 2) Shared between the River and BTR
B005SQ3AI0|5.0|If you like Dinah Washington, you will love this collection.  You probably already have many of these songs in other Dinah Albums, but to get them altogether in this collection.......and at this fabulous price.....makes it a must for everyone.
B00536OCZA|5.0|Remastered 180 gram vinyl with great sound<br /><br />Love the album, 2nd behind Wish you were here! but both are great Floyd
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Nothing to write home about: implausible, lots of action, but without the old Bond humor. I guess I should have waited for another James Bond marathon on TV.
B004ER0F8W|4.0|Good album, not a BTR or Darkness but you see Bruce becoming Bruce.  A must for any serious Springsteen fan, as I am!<br /><br />I am always impressed on how these songs at this point in his life are still relevant in todays world
B004SBS8LA|5.0|It keeps my grandson entertained for hours. He loves playing all of the Angry Bird games. I enjoy it on occasion myself to pass the time.
B004EFYZ1C|4.0|I use this App along with several other Moon and Photography apps to follow and determine moon phase and placement
B005SJIP1E|5.0|These are my favorite versions of the 3rd and 7th symphonies. The 8th is soulful and splendid, despite a less than ideal soloist or two. The finale of the 1st is another highlight.
B00004Y6NX|5.0|This is one of my favorite Dire Straits albums,<br /><br />I own both the CD and the Vinyl version and both have great sound quality
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I hate to say this, but I really did not like this book.  I only read it to see how the story ended, but I was not a fan of any of the books.  It was finished too quickly, that only opened more questions than answering any.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|My high school son turned me onto this book as he was reading for class.<br /><br />Well written and a wonderful story.
B00BHMF578|1.0|The audio was unitelligable & I couild not watch  this video.<br />Went to a competitor to watch this product.<br />Not happy
B00594XOZU|5.0|This is so much better than the standard texting app built into the phone.  Seems quicker, and easier to use that what Verizon supplies
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was the most talked about book our book club has read.  Everyone had an opinion and most were positive.  I personally really enjoyed reading the book and would recommend it.  You will hate the characters and think how could anyone be so messed up but you won't want to stop reading.  I did not like the ending but as crazy as the people were it was probably appropriate.
B000SJ9N1K|5.0|In my opinion there is not a bad Led Zeppelin album.<br /><br />This is the vinyl version (I own the cd) and sound quality is as expected
B00B49L7Y4|5.0|Loved the movie. I grew up in Detroit in the '60's so it was like going home again. A humble man who made a positive impact on the world.
B000FCKC4C|3.0|Its okay.... not a classic in my opinion.<br /><br />Nice buildup to the main focus of the book, then it seemed rushed.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|An addictive way to kill time. At first it was a challenge, but seemed easier even though the grid got bigger as you went on.
B009A9EYUO|5.0|I wanted to pick this one up on vinyl just to have in my collection.  Great Rage, regardless of your opinion its nice to hear theirs.<br /><br />Sound quality of the vinyl is okay
B00785P2QC|4.0|I thought the game was good. its a game I can play when I have some freetime. its not a game that recommended for those in a rush. my child also love watching me play this game.
1451695195|5.0|It took me a while to read this book not because its long or boring but because I like it so much I didn't want it to end..I cant tell you anymore than what other readers have wrote here all I can say is I highly recommend this book.
B0002DB52M|1.0|The worst movie that I ever saw in my entire life.  Don't waste your time and money.  Terrible and Very Wierd!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005FISBTO|5.0|As usual, this is a great season. The previews for Showtime, however, divulge a major spoiler. Truly a bummer.  Michael C HaIl has wonderful character development in this season, and the plot is intriguing. In other news, I bought this used and had no problems.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show.  So many interesting characters with thier own story lines.  I can't wait for the next episode.
B005GFPZYK|2.0|Chris realy addressed the reality of war in a modern society. The book could have been better if it was written as a soldiers account of war on the front lines. The autobiography-view of Chris Kyle and sniper records was the least enjoyable.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I didn't like this book at all, well maybe the first chapter then all of the characters become insane. I do mean all main characters and most of the extra characters .I wouldn't want to come within 5 ft of any one in this book in real life. I have never read a book where so many characters are so off the chart insane! I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone quite the opposite. It is just to much.
B004Y042N8|5.0|this is fun and a challenge.  It is like solving a puzzle but better because it lights up and you can see right away if you a right.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I loved this book. All of the characters were very well developed whether  you loved them or hated them. I had a hard time falling asleep at night because I needed to find out what was going to happen next.
0547884591|5.0|First I must say I'm a big fan of all he's books.<br />For me its all about the learning, and he gives good tips and pointers here, just like he has before.<br />Lots of good and healthy foods and much more!<br />Enjoy! :)<br />Per-Andre' form Norway
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Seems like a great game to play but I'm inclined to not want to work that hard. In otherwards its just a little too much for me to deal with because of my disability. However I dearly love horses and I liked the realness of it so I will be keeping the game.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great acting, great storyline.  Love the series.  We have watched the first two seasons in just the past 2-3 weeks and now we're on to season 3.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love playing this game. I relaxes me right before bedtime.  It truly is a wonderful card game that I have been playing since I was about 11 years old.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Love this series. It is well conceived and planned. New details emerge every other episode about the plot from the other side, a parallel world where shape-shifters prepare a war with our world.
B0036UMM84|4.0|Good to see this movie again after so many years.  Styles have sure changed.  I liked the 70s fashions though.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|I enjoyed Season 2, but the first Season is still hard to beat.  Looking forward to see what they do in the next season.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app!  I use it everyday,  sometimes several times a day. I highly recommend it.  It's  hard to imagine dressing for the day without it now.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Excellent recount of Chris's experience as a Navy Seal and his actions in the middle east. A must read for anyone interested in how the war was faught!
B00499NHLC|5.0|This was a surprise find in the Prime instant video list! Benedict Cumberbatch is a terrific modern day Sherlock. The stories are loosely based on the originals with modern twists and turns. Martin Freeman's Dr. Watson is the perfect humane, empathetic partner to Sherlock's rigid objectivity. Good story, good acting, and good chemistry make this one worth your time.
B0017ANAZO|5.0|good movie. not much more i can say about it - i prefer it over the older film but that is just my preference
B001LM1456|4.0|My grandson just loved this movie.  I also rented the original TV Pilot  so we could see that together but he didn't like it as much.  Not enough action and there were no Army men.  what else can you expect from a five year old action packed grandson.
B000HL0EEE|4.0|I enjoyed it a lot.  Wish the show lasted longer than it course.  Good story lines that explain a lot of the ST universe.
B001EBYM8A|5.0|Exciting! The good guy always wins in the end.<br /><br />Coudn't have picked better actors for the movie.<br /><br />What a great way to spend my evening!
B009GEAPYW|3.0|Batman is old and out of shape... but somehow comes back after 10 years and is the same ole crime fighter?  Not buying it.  Storyline is nothing original.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Followed the book very well.  Deathly hallows part 2 should be just as great.  Have to like these kinds of movies to begin with.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|My daughter and I loved this movie. She enjoyed the music and I loved the whole plot. Protecting his daughter from humans and then a human comes to his daughters birthday. This movie made me and my daughter laugh. I hope there is a part two on this movie.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|Not a big Adam sandler fan his movies are usually kinda simple and stupid and he always has this creepy smile when delivering his lines but his voice was spot on in this picture. The family enjoyed it
B004T6IBNY|2.0|I purchased this through my Kindle HD 8.9. It takes up only a small portion of the available screen - not much bigger than on my phone. Disappointing, because the graphics are pretty good and on the larger screen it would surely be a better user experience. I'm sorry I paid for it - I have a free pinball that is beautiful and much more robust on this platform.
B000W93CHC|5.0|In my opinion, he is an elite class of writers of Historical Fiction. The pages turn so quickly, and easily.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Game is fun but I don't spend real money on games.  This makes progressing slow and sometimes not all game components are available.  A lot of time is spent on one or two rooms and the availability of the necessary diamonds is lacking.
B008TRUDAS|3.0|Great teenage romance. Not to sappy just the right amount of lovey dovey. A little bit of a tear jerker.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I can't get enough of NCIS. I am totally hooked on it and can wait to get home at night to watch these episodes.
0765325950|5.0|Loved it and hated it for ending, even though the books before Towers of Midnight were going a bit slow. I plan on keeping this book with me for the rest of my life, and sooner or later buy the rest of the series in hardcover
B001FVV2X2|4.0|The weird science makes it a little different from the average police crime drama and there's humor as well. The lead characters are interesting.
B005PK56TA|5.0|First of all, kudos to Amazon....I watched the first season episodes of &#34;American Horror Story&#34; on my recently purchased Kindle Fire HD 8.9 tablet. Video quality was very good. As far as this TV show, it's one of those programs that I would categorize as &#34;creepy&#34; yet &#34;fascinating&#34; to watch. I think only horror fans will be able to stomach this show. Some scenes/visuals in this show can sometimes make you feel slightly &#34;queasy,&#34; but I like it all the same. I think anyone who's watched this show would agree that the characters in this series are all definitely &#34;STRANGE.&#34; Jessica Lange's character on the show is my favorite. Hope the quality and flavor of the show doesn't change.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this app!  I downloaded it on my Kindle Fire HD, and I couldn't be happier with it.  It alerts you when auctions and watch-list items are coming to an end, messages as well.  It's also good to have when looking for hard to find items, and on-the-go for price comparisons.<br />I am a huge nail junkie, and I'm constantly buying polishes and other nail design accessories.  Having the Ebay app has saved me a lot of money on products.  Last week I was looking at some flocking powder at the craft store, priced at $19.95.  I opened my E-bay app, and saw the same brand for $11.00, as well as some on auction.  I put the auction on my watch list, and left the craft store!  The next day at work, my Kindle beeped, alerting me to the end of the auction.  I put in my bid at the last minute, and  ended up winning the auction.  I got the same exact flocking powder that was retailed at $19.95, for only $3.00!  I would of missed out on it without the app.<br />That's not the first time I saved money by using the Ebay app, and it won't be the last.  I HIGHLY recommend The Official Ebay Android App :)
B0068THAGY|5.0|Not exactly ET but it's a good story with great characters.  It's hard not to imagine JJ Abrams running around with a an 8mm camera after watching this.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great acting and story. Areal joy to watch. Can't wait till season four starts. I hear that season four will be the last.
B008K8VDPU|3.0|I like to ability to choose the song and instruments.<br />I would recommend this to a person starting to learn the piano.<br />I wish I could choose the song.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|We have loved all of the Ice Age movies. They did a great job extending the story line with Many and Ellie having Peaches. Great movie again!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The game is really fun to play.  You can have as many horses as you want. The competitions are fun.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Enjoy playing Angry Birds, especially since it is free.  I know commercials are necessary, but sometimes an ad every 10 seconds is a bit much.  This does not happen all the time.  Some of the levels are very hard to achieve since I just started playing this game, but after quite a few tries, you can figure it out. Thanks again for some great free entertainment.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I love this author.  I read &#34;The Secret Keeper&#34; and was immediately hooked on Kate Morton.  She is an eloquent writer and provides the reader with the right amount of don't ask, don't tell throughout the entire story....keeping us just within reach of the answer the whole way through the book.  I love the time spans through generations and the character development and the beauty of her words.  In this book, as in the Secret Keeper, there are such wonderful surprises lurking around every corner that each time I picked up the book, it was as if I was opening a new present!  There are stories within her stories and it is such fun to read!
B001QJUX24|5.0|I'm certainly biased, but not only is the best John Wayne performance in my opinion, buit one of the ten best movies of all time. To me, knowing a little more about the basis for the story, it has elements of real Texas history in it, (which I really appreciate) and the picture experience is as impressive on the big screen as it is on my TV. I believe &#34;The Searchers&#34; is a must see, even if one doesn't like westerns. Thanks.
055338466X|1.0|one word<br />\\"the book didn't add anything new at all\\"<br />if you read his past 4 books, no need to read this one.
B0095P29EG|5.0|The movie had a good action base and story to it. The way Thor got his name back by becoming what his father wanted him to be
B00136NUG6|5.0|EWF wrote & performed some of the greatest tunes of their era.That said all those tunes are just as bad-ass today as the 1st time I heard them.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|30 years of insomnia medication to the creators of this software!!! sleep studies etc..and now I find this works the best. Kudos to the creators of this software!!!
B003JTHXOK|3.0|**A 3.5 Review**<br /><br />Quote This…<br /><br />“Every couple needs to argue now and then. Just to prove that the relationship is strong enough to survive. Long-term relationships, the ones that matter, are all about weathering the peaks and the valleys.”<br /><br />***<br /><br />Sometimes late at night, when I have a hard time sleeping I turn on the TV and drown out my brain with mindless, utterly ridiculous programming. 9 out of 10 times it’s COPS. Aside from the blatant disregard for shoes (or teeth) I find the people on this show fascinating. With one exception: the screaming, crying, usually snot covered battered wife. THIS is the point when I turn the TV off and find something much more constructive to do (for example: counting each individual strand of hair on my head.)<br /><br />Now…chances are you are currently contemplating the probability that I am completely and totally heartless (or at the very least lack compassion and understanding for my fellow female.) That is not the case. What I lack is empathy for someone who refuses to help themselves.<br /><br />See…90% of the time…the women on COPS make excuses.<br /><br />“He’s a great guy! I promise. He just had a few too many to drink tonight.”<br />“It was an accident, I swear! I’m crazy clumsy and punched the wall with my face.”<br />“He loves me!”<br />“He’s really sorry!”<br />“No…I’m not going to press charges. He says it will never happen again.”<br />That last statement is the kicker. The help is right in front of her, but she refuses to accept it.<br /><br />That last statement is also the reason I put off reading “Safe Haven” for so long.  Nicholas Sparks does not deal in happy endings, and his protagonist (or lead) in this story is a victim of domestic abuse. In short… I was afraid of the combination.<br /><br />That said…the second the movie trailer was released, I had to read the book. You know…me being OCD and all.<br /><br />Love hurts. There is nothing as painful as heartbreak. But in order to learn to love again, you must learn to trust again.<br />When a mysterious young woman named Katie appears in the small North Carolina town of Southport, her sudden arrival raises questions about her past. Beautiful yet self-effacing, Katie seems determined to avoid forming personal ties until a series of events draws her into two reluctant relationships: one with Alex, a widowed store owner with a kind heart and two young children; and another with her plainspoken single neighbor, Jo. Despite her reservations, Katie slowly begins to let down her guard, putting down roots in the close-knit community and becoming increasingly attached to Alex and his family.<br /><br />But even as Katie begins to fall in love, she struggles with the dark secret that still haunts and terrifies her . . . a past that set her on a fearful, shattering journey across the country, to the sheltered oasis of Southport. With Jo’s empathic and stubborn support, Katie eventually realizes that she must choose between a life of transient safety and one of riskier rewards . . . and that in the darkest hour, love is the only true safe haven<br /><br />As with every novel before it (and I’m sure every novel yet to come) “Safe Haven” followed the Nicholas Sparks “3 Step Guide to a Successful Romance.” 1 attractive couple + 1 secret/disease + 1 death = a successful book. And, well…I can’t say that I blame him (why fix what ain’t broke right?)  But that doesn’t stop me from wishing he would take a chance. Throw acid on his comfort zone.<br /><br />I LIKED “Safe Haven.” I promise. The characters were engaging (as they usually are.) The backstories and current plot were solid (even if they were a little safe.) And the moment of doom (otherwise known as the relationship explosion) was action packed and delivered with expert precision. All positives in the eye of a casual reader.<br /><br />So why am I nit-picking?<br /><br/>Because I can. (How’s that for blunt.)<br /><br />I guess I’ve grown tired of the predictability of it all. Maybe my ability to pin point the “big reveal” (which for the record happens in the last 2 chapters of the book) by 50% dulled some of the shine.  Whatever it was, I was left feeling complacent vs. absorbed.<br /><br />What does that mean?<br /><br />It was just another book. Another “love will conquer all, I wonder who is going to kick the bucket in this time” Nicholas Sparks throw-down.<br /><br />I say…take it or leave it.<br /><br />Happy Reading my fellow Kindle-ites and remember: if your characters don’t challenge you, challenge them!/>Because I can.

B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I just received my KINDLE FIRE 8.9 and wanted to do something with besides read books.  My wife is a \\"HIDDEN OBJECT\\" junky and said I should give it a try, I'm hooked.<br /><br />Pro's: It's nice to have a story line to go along with the game and the graphics are outstanding. I have found most of the puzzles challenging but not so hard that I want to toss my new KINDLE against the wall.<br /><br />Con's: The endgame is a bit drawn out but not so much as to give it a 4 star rating.<br /><br />Like I said, I'm a rookie at hidden object games but I think the noobie and pro alike will enjoy this game.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a good game it really cool and I wish I had a horse so when I when I grow up I will know how to take care f a horse and I will teach my kids how to take care of a horse and I will let them take care of my horse.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This tv prduction is first class.  I have watched all the episodes and they are all well done.  One flows right into the next one,
B006TJXZ30|5.0|When I wrote my first review of this app, I was an avid user of Hotmail and never had issues with the app itself. I highly praised the app and still do for anyone who has Hotmail. You don't have to go online to access your email. Very convenient. Alerts you when you have new messages. Easy to use and you can use it with all the same features that are in Hotmail. My issue was with Hotmail itself. I have since then closed out my account with Hotmail and removed the app from my Kindle Fire as it was no longer a necessity to still have it. Was upset with the problems I kept getting from dealing with Hotmail and was not interested in staying with them as they are soon to upgrade to a whole new format under a different name. I got tired of trying to go back and forth between the app and my account online with Hotmail. Now this is just my experience with Hotmail and I realize not everyone has the same situation. If you've never had issues, with Hotmail, then this app is worth it. Again, my review still recommends to purchase this app, but it didn't work out for me due to my disappointment with Hotmail itself.
B00BHNR1KQ|1.0|first attempt at a new release and was very disappointed; the sound was inaudible at any level and the feed was horrid; was not able to view entire move.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I am a nervous reck when it comes to flying, this game help take<br />my mind from being 20,000+in the air, one of my favorites...:)
B002RKSZKI|4.0|I'm so sorry, but I simply fail to see what's so wonderful about Jane Austen.  Her writing is adroit, and paints an intriguing picture of her times.  She illustrates the psychology of a historic culture, but....I just don't find her all that wonderful.  I realize I'll be stoned by all the Jane Austen fans out there, but THERE IT IS.
B002M2T1UO|4.0|Only complaint is the DVD menu could have been better, a little more explanation about ea. episode, but that's not really a problem.<br /><br />I like the packaging compared to other products, it opens like a big book, very sturdy.<br /><br />The extra deleted scenes are interesting too.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Informative and interesting in an effective storytelling style.  Helps me understand the incredible depth of this historical icon balanced with his human limitations.  I admire him all the more.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Great movie. No need to discuss the content, it is a classic. I just purchased it because it had to be part of my collection.  I am glad a found it on bluray.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Started reading this out of boredom and got hooked Immediately. Great book I can't wait to read the next book.
0439813786|5.0|Read this book, it is fun and has elements that are not found in the movie. It is a great read.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I HAD HEARD THAT THIS MOVIE HACHI WAS A GOOD MOVIE. BUT THAT WAS AN UNDER STATEMENT. IT MADE A LOT OF OUR FAMILY CRY.
B000WAGVHE|5.0|This musical is fun, and broaches the important issues of segregation and judgment about a person based on external appearances.
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|THANK YOU FOR OFFERING THIS MOVIE ONLINE. I WAS WANTING THESE MOVIE AFTER I SEEN THEM ON TV. NOW WE CAN WATCH THEM WHENEVER WE WANT TO.

B004VMUS9G|5.0|I use this clock and it's features on a daily basis to time everything, on my Kindle and my android phone.<br />I also use it as a back up to my regular alarm clock and that has saved my add<br />quite a few times. Also, if I make sure my devices are charged before going to bed<br />It is great to have this app should the power go out. Everyone should have this app if they are concerned about<br />time. Just to let you know, this app has worked just fine on both of my devices.
B00275EHJG|5.0|THIS MOVIE COMPLETED MY COLLECTION OF TOY STORY MOVIES. ALL MY GRANDCHILDREN REALLY ENJOY WATCHING ALL THESE MOVIES AS A FAMILY.
B00APUQJLO|1.0|I really couldn't finish watching this movie, which was largely an excuse to watch Patterson's face.  He's pretty but the movie was terrible.  Sorry.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Oh. My. God. That was AMAZING!!! I absolutely love the daddy daughter moments, and how protective Bella is of Nessie!!! Carlisle is awesome!  Jacobs POV made me laugh so hard I actually fell out of my chair a few times... But yay!!! I love it! So sad it's over though!!! Maybe she'll write another book one day. :)
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|Freakin' hilarious! Couldn't ask for a better cast! Very clean, nothing inappropriate at all. Perfect for both children and adults.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I understood all the dissatisfaction they each experienced in their relationship, but, down deep they both loved each other,  They should have gone for counseling to solve their problems.  Of course, then there would be no interesting book.
B0013FFMOK|5.0|I saw it when it first hit theatres and wanted it on hand to relive the fun of that moment.
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|Fabulous! An absolute awesome film!!  As usual, Anthony Hopkins is the best truly a great actor. This man can play any part assigned to him. He makes you believe he's Alfred Hitchcock. You can't tell where Hitchcock begins and Hopkins ends, LOL! A Helen Mirren is great as Hitchcock's wife Alma. She is also a great actor. If you're like me and like Hitchcock films and his TV shows, Alfred Hitchcock Presents and the Alfred Hitchcock Hour, not to mention all of his great movies such as Rebecca, Psycho and The Birds, you're going to love this movie. To give you some background without giving too much about the film away, it is based on the challenges Alfred Hitchcock and his wife Alma faced while filming Psycho. Psycho, by the way, turned out to be his greatest film to date and that's why this is such a great movie. He overcame every obstacle sent his way to get Psycho filmed, directed and ultimately in movie theaters across the country. By the way, the girl who plays Janet Leigh (leading lady in Psycho), is adorable. She is so cute and she looks and act just like Janet Leigh. The guy who plays Tony Perkins is cute as well. The costumes and makeup are remarkable and absolutely beautiful, in this movie. They take you back to the era in time when Psycho was made, so you feel like you're in the early 1960s. Rent or buy this movie. I highly recommend it!!

B00006J9OT|5.0|She picks her songs very carefully and then she turns her laser-like talent on them to make them hers, all hers.  She is always at her best when she is heard live and this CD does not disappoint.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|I am sort of a Johhny Depp fan and just wanted the film for my collection of Johnny Depp films.
B008V0OLOW|5.0|Even though this was recorded in a studio, and I generally prefer her songs when sung live, this CD does not disappoint at all.  She has picked her songs carefully and she presents them very well.

B004V5QWU2|5.0|I remember going to my grandma's house when I was little. She has this big grandfather clock in her living room and I would love to sleep on the couch just to fall asleep to the ticking sound it made. The sound here is very close to that old grandfather clock and I LOVE it!
B000VJAICK|5.0|I saw it when it first hit theatres and wanted it on hand to relive the fun of that moment.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Very user friendly, gathers coins and cute realistic graphics, prizes come easily, moves up levels with more prizes and more coins, or sell your prizes to get more coins..most fun collecting  puzzle pieces which add big points and $$...most relaxing , enjoyable game I have downloaded!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|A very well written book that makes very great points. There are many great examples as well! It is great for people in relationship as well, not only married couples (although it refers to married couples). I've recently tried the app they have for iphone with weekly challenges they have for you and your partner, which is really entertaining. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone!
B00BHMF578|5.0|Gripping account of real world drama. Actors well suited to their respective roles. Viewers will feel like they are part of the action.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I loved this game on my computer but love it more to take to bed and play before going to sleep!
B00BB8SKPW|1.0|Given the flight heroics of Denzel are utterly ridiculous, there is in fact no basis for developing any feelings for his fatally flawed character.
B0034G4OYK|2.0|I love monster films and animation - but this was a Z grade effort any way you look at it.<br /><br />I'm always disappointed if I invest in a movie for my library then discover it's something I'll never ever watch again.<br /><br />Don't bother. It's a bloody bore. Not a movie you can sink your teeth into. It really sucks. So awful it drove me batty. (Okay, I'm done.)
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|THE FILM HELD MY ATTENTION I LIKE DANZIEL WASHINGTON AS A AN ACTOR THE SUBJECT MATTER DEALT WITH A PROBLEM THAT MAY EXIST TODAY
B004G600A4|5.0|A new Disney classic!<br /><br />The folks at Disney really hit their mark with this film - it LOOKS and FEELS like classic Disney cartoon animation reinterpreted in CGI.<br /><br />From the character design to the sparkling Alan Menken songs, this is a WINNER. Funny, exciting, and heart-warming.<br /><br />And the 3D is gorgeous!
B002XMBVEM|4.0|Great collection with a mixture of upbeat and slower melodic music. I can listen to it on a run or just relaxing in my room.
B001H4R4LQ|3.0|Decent storyline, nice character development, nice utilization of english language although not at the level of Robert Jordan . Nice pacing and an overall worthwhile series.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wow amazing<br /> As I read I could actually feel the emotions of the characters!<br /> Can't wait to read the next one and it was a shock that peeta didn't know katniss was just playing along. Even though I watched the movies like a million times first the book made me still want to keep reading!
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Gladwell manages to define apparent God given ability into an in depth account of when the right circumstances and hard work come to create greatness.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this app is great I love it its not for little kids too hard it was worth it TEMPLE RUN 2 FOREVER
1607066017|5.0|Great Story, Great Art, Great Price.  You can't go wrong with this one.  I recommend this to ALL comic fans.
B00A2H9LK6|4.0|A lot of people criticize Silent Hill: Revelation.<br /><br />A lot.<br /><br />They say that it twists the game's backstory too much, that it doesn't get details right, that it's badly put together...  But a lot of these critiques miss the point.<br /><br />This isn't Silent Hill 3.  This is Silent Hill 3 done in the context of the first Silent Hill film, and that makes many of the changes necessary.  As a result, the story is a little bit foggy (pun intended) but it's a very fun watch.  The only part I didn't really like was the fact that almost everyone's natural accents broke through a bit too much and took me out of the film a bit.  I liked some of the original takes on creatures and the use of minor shocks to create a creepy atmosphere.  The CGI is not the best, but the practical effects are very well-done.<br /><br />All in all?  It's worth a watch if you enjoyed the first film.  If you loved the first film and love nods to the video game series, it's worth a buy.
B00005K3O4|5.0|This DVD arrived in plenty of time to give to my friend as a gift. I didn't watch it myself to know if it ran well, but I haven't heard anything to say it didn't.
B007PT1PEY|4.0|Was entertaining for me at least. I always like reading a good book. I'm sure others will say different, it's all a matter of perspective.
B005FISBTO|5.0|The product arrived in a timely manor and ran I had no problems running it. It is worth buying new as opposed to used.
B005CVWWJY|5.0|For anyone who lived in the eighties and enjoyed the movies and games particular to that decade, it's a wonderful read.
B0053O89Z6|5.0|The product arrived in a timely manor and ran I had no problems running it. It is worth buying new as opposed to used.
B00BETX5PS|1.0|We rented the movie in HD. Tried several times to start over. Tried another movie which wasn't a problem. We ended up not seeing the movie. It was too blurry.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I'm enjoying the game for the most part. I just wish there was more information on the different buildings, cars etc. Overall it's a good Sim type game.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The story plot just keeps you going. I love all the characters, especially the grandmother. She is so funny. I can't wait to watch the 3rd season. I have recommended it to numerous friends who enjoy watching a turn of the century drama.
B00280LYIC|5.0|He has way of making history interesting like with the Greek and Roman gods and the Egyptian gods. Do know it's not boring listening to his tutu our or mythology.
B007TXN4TK|4.0|Grand daughers love it as do the younger girls!  They like to play the music themselves and then of course the \\"game\\".  Masters all of them!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Does exaclty what it is supposed to. works well with kindle fire also. Great app! would definetly recommend to anyone looking for exact battery percentage.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book gives awesome insite to the world of the modern adolescent! While it is an older realistic fiction novel by modern standards, the reader catches the underlying adolescent themes which are timeless!
B009CPJHY4|2.0|Movie kept stopping to stream. Finally had to stop and start completely over. Took 3 hours to watch  2 hour movie. The movie itself? Great actors in an implausible story.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love Nicholas Sparks books.... there is always a twist that I never see coming! I highly recommend this book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i love this app sooooooooo much because you can do jobs muck the stalls and teach riding lessons. by the way i love horses soooooo much!!!!!!!!
B004LZEV4Q|3.0|It's very sensitive to being completely flat, something that's not easy to do when reading to a 2 year old. Also, the &#34;start or play&#34; button is right where a little one can and will push it thereby ending the story in progress or stopping it before it begins which requires closing the page and starting over again. Try to get a 2 year old to stop pushing the button EVERY TIME to hear the &#34;lady's voice.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|don't log onto facebook it will delete your gaming information and you will have to start all over again it has happened to me twice don't make the same mistake that i did
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Grief could only be lived through.  How true.  This is a very thought provoking read.  Why we're nuns such bitter creatures when they supposedly became nuns out of the love of God?
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Story is great.  A fine balance of predictability and \\"I-didn't-that-coming-ness\\"  Can't wait for Season 3.  Some streaming issues at first.  Works fine now.
B000UZPIAW|5.0|I loved reading about the wild times the band experienced on and off the road.  Had no idea Nikki Sixx was such a deep thinker.  Truly a must read (even if you don't like Motley Crue's music).
B007REV4YI|5.0|Dame Judi Dench, Ralph Fiennes and Daniel Craig acted their butts off.  You could appreciate the genuine affection that M had for 007 - but she had a love for England over the likes of one British agent.  There were many homages to previous Bond movies - Javier Bardem was the epitome of a Bond villain complete with the insane hair style that did NOT go with the actual look of the character.  When Bardem said, &#34;Oh, Mr. Bond, I was transported back to the old school, Sean Connery Bond.  All in all, an excellent movie.
B008M87GJK|5.0|Living on the West Coast of the US, this app gives me the news before I read it in the paper the next morning.  The app works great, most stories have a short video and always a pic, it displays beautiful graphics on my Kindle Fire HD and has excellent stories.  Love it.
B00881VLCE|4.0|You can chose the level you wish.  It is very easy to play and entertaining to many levels of ability.
B0066WJLU6|3.0|I'm iffy on this.  So you can change the colors, okay.  I downloaded this to my Kindle Fire HD for walking around the house after dark, but I only need to have a book or puzzle open and I can do the same thing.  Nothing exciting here for me.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is my favorite game so far.  I love the increasing challenge and it is a lot of fun to play!
B007THA4FI|5.0|I don't think I could add anything too different from what's already been said about The Casual Vacancy in over three thousand Amazon reviews. I've noticed that the reviews are mixed, and about half either loved the book or half didn't. I'd like to add up front that I did not read anything in the Harry Potter series because I'm not a fan of that genre. I saw a few of the movies and I yawned through them. Once again, because I'm not a fan of that particular genre.<br /><br />But I am a fan of J.K. Rowling now and it's all because of The Casual Vacancy. I've read where a lot of people didn't like the fact that there are so many characters. I found this aspect not only refreshing, but also something most writers aren't capable of doing. As a writer I know how difficult it is to weave multiple characters into a plot and I don't do it often because it's so difficult to keep the story flowing and at the same time keep reminding the reader who the characters are. And I didn't have any issues following all the characters in The Casual Vacancy. In fact, what kept me reading and thinking about the book was what was going to happen to these characters. And there's really nothing extraordinary about them, and yet you wind up caring about them.<br /><br />I will admit that I started this book a while ago, and then I put it aside because I got busy with other things. But that's something else I loved about it. I do that with authors like John Irving sometimes. I'll start the book, get to a certain point, and then stop reading for a few weeks...even months sometimes...and then come back to it right where I left off. And after all that time, if the book is good enough, those characters and the plot are with me to a certain extent. I can't say that about many other books I've read in my lifetime. And that's because a book like The Casual Vacancy only comes along once in a while.<br /><br />I noticed a lot of people compared TCV to Peyton Place. I would go so far as to say that it did remind me of Peyton Place, but I don't think Grace Metalious was anywhere near the author J.K. Rowling is. If I had to compare Petyon Place to anything nowadays I would probably compare it to Fifty Shades of Grey instead of The Casual Vacancy because I think Metalious and E.L. James are probably on the same level as far as author skills go. And that's by no means a slur to either of them. They both wrote great books and people loved them.<br /><br />But there's a literary quality to The Casual Vacancy that crosses that painfully thin line into mainstream commercial that truly interested me. From page one, I found myself caring about the people of Pagford and wondering what was going to happen to them. I also found reading about lifestyles in the UK just as interesting. In many ways, it's not all that different from the US, and Pagford could have been my little town, New Hope, in Bucks County, PA....from the politics to the class warfare to the little secrets going on behind the scenes.<br /><br />What some readers have commented on is that there's a dark side to this book, and I just didn't see that. There's a realistic side. I saw that very plainly. But I didn't see all the darkness and gloom. Like I said, it's real and sometimes it's intense. And sometimes there's some wit and humor worked into the book when you don't expect it. It's also gossipy in the way many small towns are. But I just didn't see all that darkness and gloom others talked about.<br /><br />Rowling could have held back in some instances, especially with regard to the male teenage characters. And yet she didn't, and I found this aspect of the book more like a character study. It surprised me, too. As someone who never had read Harry Potter, I honestly didn't think she had it in her. This is why I didn't want to get into an overall plot description with this review. So many others have done that well in other reviews, and I wanted to add a few different thoughts...if that's possible...for readers who might be thinking of reading The Casual Vacancy but aren't sure if it's the book for them.<br /><br />All I can say if that if you like things glossed over and hidden, and you're not a fan of really reading about some of the more intense things in life, this might not be the book for you. If you tend to take the more difficult aspects of life seriously and you carry images around in your head for a long time, this book might not be for you either. But if you are interested in reading something that gets into the realities and complications of what life is like today, I think you'll be pleasantly surprsed at how J.K. Rowling managed to pull this off. And I hope there are more books like this one in her future.s who might be thinking of reading The Casual Vacancy but aren't sure if it's the book for them.<br /><br />All I can say if that if you like things glossed over and hidden, and you're not a fan of really reading about some of the more intense things in life, this might not be the book for you.

B009O2XY12|4.0|I liked it especially since it was free, but then needed to purchase more gems to play it after I lost a few games..  Don't want to have to pay to play it.
B00BHMF578|4.0|Suspensefull, good acting, intense near the end but a little slow at the beginning.  Compared to &#34;Lincoln&#34;, not as impressive
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I really like the information this battery app provides such as the charge time and the use time remaining. It's quick and easy to use without being a nuisance.

B002P79KAC|5.0|Every season of this hilarious serious series just reels you in more and more. The laughter that brings tears to your eyes. The great catch phrases. Crap on a cracker. Penny! Penny! Penny! I'm not crazy.....my mother had me tested! Soft kitty, warm kitty, Little ball of fur......and let's not forget Sheldon's &#34;Bazinga!&#34;<br />Every week just gives you more and more of this great group of friends.........Sheldon, Lenard, Penny, Howard, Raj, Amy, Burnadette, Priya Koothrappali, Leslie Winkle, lisping Barry Cripke, Stuart, the ever unseen Mrs. Wallowitz, Dr. & Mrs.Koothrappali, Beverly Hofstader, Mary Cooper, Dr.Gablehowser, and every single guest star ever invited has always delivered the goods full of laughter.
B003UBTX6S|3.0|It was an entertaining book.  The characters are interesting, but it's a little more teen lit than I thought it would be. Entertaining though.
B002RI9QJE|4.0|I Really enjoyed the read and it made me think about all the irrational things I do. The fact that it is based on empirical studies makes it better.
B000Y0Q5NM|4.0|If you are a fan you know the characters.  I have watched this series many times and still love to visit it.  For anybody who hasn't seen the series...can't believe there are any, this is syfy at its best.  Well thought out stories with great acting.  I particular appreciate (since I was at the beginning of the woman's movement) that Amanda Tapping, Major Carter in the series could be just as bad ass, not even a flicker of thought given to her position as female.They managed to do that without her losing her attraction as a woman when it is appropriate and would be expected.  The stories are imaginative in many ways and of course, you always have favorites.
B004GYY714|5.0|I can listen to the radio while looking at other items on my Kindle.<br />One of the best features is that all the local radio stations appear automatically.<br />This is a good app. for anyone that likes to listen to the radio while looking through Facebook or their emails.
B0011MZOEI|5.0|Willis is getting older....we know that, some of the storyline is to formula, but  don't you love his gritty style, crazy dogged determination, things blowing up and some stunts you'd never concieve of in a million! this is a movie done with great effects and fun and omg can you imagine!  I particular like techy doom stories and all of the characters that it brings in.  If you are determined to stick a moral in here, mine is you just don't give up....you keep going one hand over the other, slide down a crashing overpass and standoff a F15 fighter jet just keep going.  What fun!  It introduces his daughter as a teenager and we get a peek at McClain the Dad their unrelationship.  The young hero is great as a geek who just wants to go home and pretend nothing is happening.  He's thoroughly likeable and believable.  Don't know if the cyber attack scenario is possible, but judging how many time my Visa Card number has to be changed by the Bank....it scary enough to think that it is.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Beautifully written lyrics. He should continue to write. He's from my era so I know he can still conjure great songs from his magical bag of musical bliss
B00153ZC8Q|4.0|I had not seen this movie for many years.. so many, that I totally forgot what the movie was all about... my son, who is 14 years, has been wanting to watch the saga for a while but since these movies are rated R, I didn't feel comfortable letting him watch them. So my husband and I decided that we would allow him to watch the saga as long as we all watch them together. My son loved the first movie and could not wait to see the rest. In my case, it felt like watching a brand new movie. Likewise, I cannot wait for saturday, our movie night. Thanks Amazon for keeping old movies available.
B001TCHDPS|4.0|A lost soul now found! Too bad sixto didnt get the recognition he deserved. Lyrically he is superb! He is a master poet. Nothing in the last 35 years has been created to match his incredible imagery! Wow !!!!
B00B935SUY|5.0|Crank this one up, you won't  be disappointed!!!!!A lot of rock music tid-bits that will keep you interested. Just a nice story about an important part of recording.
B00936A0ZW|5.0|This guy is just cool. His mastery of chops is always a delight to here. I never tire of him. I met him at NAMM and he is a great individual too.
B000KFB4PK|3.0|This watch looks far more like a toy than I'd expected from the online picture. The background for the face of the watch looked like<br />it was cut out of newsprint. When the gift was open several people said &#34;is it a real watch?&#34; or &#34;does it actually work?&#34; and doubted it because it appeared to be make believe. The box has &#34;6 yrs+&#34; printed on it. I bought it as a gift for a 12 year old Lego fan and was rather embarrassed to give it to him once I saw how &#34;little kid&#34; it looked rather than &#34;classic Lego&#34; as I'd hoped.  Couldn't return it because I needed the gift the day it arrived. Probably OK for younger kids who want to know what time it is.
B008ANFRGQ|5.0|Of all guitarists, which now there are many, Vai has always stood out with style and innovation musicaly. His aproach to the math of music has always changed the boundries of atypical music.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book had me hooked from the very beginning.  Chris Kyle's writing made me feel like I was right there with him.  The high points and low points kept the book exciting from the first page through the last.<br />There will never be another man like Chris Kyle.  The legend will live on forever.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator app is wonderful!  Very  easy  to use with big numbers for those with eye sight  trouble I can even  see mine without my glasses or contacts!
B007D2XSW0|3.0|The app won't let me save photos. It says that it is saving but picture is never saved to sdcard. This didn't happen until I upgraded to Android 4.2.1<br />Too bad cause this is my favorite photo app. Please fix. Thanks :)
B002M5E2DW|5.0|Found this book very helpful hear about it on the Stev Harvey show, Loved it worth a read. for sure
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I thought Chris was open and honest, the book was an easy read. Not too graphic but he got the point across.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|The first book I read out of school when I was a young teenager was Harry Potter and I loved it so much I have tried to read every day since.  I have read countless books since then but this book is the first that has gripped me the same way the Harry Potter series has.  I had to force myself to put it down at night so I could get some sleep.  I would not be uncomfortable saying that this is the best book I have ever read and I wish the author, Anthony Ryan, all the success in the world because he deserves it for this masterpiece of a book.  I am eagerly awaiting book 2 and will buy it the second it is released.
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|Have owned the DVD since it was released and have considered it the gold standard of DVD music. Just got the blu ray today and I need to tell the world that this disc just became the best quality concert I've seen. The picture is phenomenal and the 5.1 DTS sound quality is jaw-dropping. A perfect match with the musicianship and harmonies the Eagles have built their reputations on. With my 73&#34; monitor and high-end system, it might be even better than being there...no $10 beers and packed restrooms--just me and one incredible band still at the top of their game. Run, don't walk to pick this blu ray up!
B0013TPV0Q|4.0|Naked was my favorite...Holidays on Ice second to that.  I got lost in all the travel...too much on the smoking cessation for my liking.
B005IQZB14|4.0|The pain is so raw, it tears at your chest, but through the miles it is gradually expunged. All in all an excellent read.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its so simple yet the graphics are awesome! love it!  :) I originally downloaded it for my niece but then I got hooked on it!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love the dramatic story line and panning camera angles.  Best show on TV in a long time!  Can't wait to see season 3!
B00338QENI|1.0|However, I am not in the science field and I appreciate the book. Rebecca Skloot did a great job of researching the HeLa Cells and it course in the medical/reseach fields and her family. By doing this she has shown the stark differences of beeing a Negro in the 1050's in the South of the USA.<br />If you can, read it! it will explain and change your mind about a lot of things, including your monthly visit to your doctor!
0802473164|4.0|I gave this to a male friend of mine having troubles in his relationship because my husband and I learned alot from the one for couples. He has read it and is learning alot himself. He says is was a good buy and easy for a man to understand
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I bought this app for my Kindle, I finally broke down and bought it. I stay on this app! It is so much better on a bigger screen then on a little iphone.
B00A77II0U|4.0|This game was fun. Worth a few bucks for a couple of hours of play. Not for children under 12 at all!
B004JMY312|4.0|Nostalgic family movie! The witches are tons of fun to watch, although the effects are a bit dated. Good for kids and their families.
B00AN0KBJC|4.0|A little stiffer than the first season, probably b/c we have to learn new characters and growing plot lines in the beginning, but it gains momentum and coalesces toward the end into something fantastic again. I even like the liberties taken with the book.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|Love Romola and the whole crew. Liked it a lot better than starchy, skin and bones Gwenyth. The house was beautiful, too.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|So great that it's free for Amazon Prime members. Been wanting to catch up for awhile now. Highly recommend it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this series and especially love the season pass offered by Amazon instant video.  I never miss a new show.
B003Z890UK|1.0|i bought a pair of skin recovery pants that were supposedly new, when they arrived there were stains in the crotch and knee area showing that they were not new but in fact used i am personally disgusted by this
B00BHMETKC|3.0|The film making is okay, but for anyone who needs to know about America's role in the world, particularly the middle east, this movie makes you look at most important event the US faced in the 1970's.  For those of us who lived through it, the movie acknowledges the shame and humiliation of that event.  I think it is a must-see.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|The suspense and the determination of Julia to find her past. Could not put my Kindle down. Great late night.
B003F3PMYI|5.0|Even though this is billed as a business book, the principles are excellent life guidelines. I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for an edge in business or life.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Started off really strong. I loved that every chapter left you with a cliff hanger, almost forcing you to read the next. However, not sure if I bought the ending. It seemed a bit over the top. I kind of wished she went in a different direction. But all in all, I liked it a lot and can't wait to see the interpretation on screen.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|This case fits well and is easy to use. It doesn't add bulk when storing it in a pocket, etc.
B004LP3AYI|4.0|The sage continues with Richard and Khalan being passing ships in the night...but Oh what a night ! I was very disappointed with the poor editing of the text as there are so many errors with words, no map which is disappointing also and it was a real test of interpretation at times.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|really action packed.. Daniel Craig as James Bond is a match made in heaven... Looking forward to the next 007.
B005K01VZS|5.0|Throughout life we all have a tendency to move away from our religious roots. This book helped draw me back to the foundation of my belief system.
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|It was a fun read, although I found myself flipping through many pages of 'Geek Talk\\". Could have shortened this yarn by 30 pages!!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is so good. If you like tense booms and romantic books this is perfect for you! You will love it!!!
B0040HO01Y|4.0|Very interesting series. Enjoy this series very much.  If you like Townton Abby, you will like Lark Rise to Candleford.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app I use it for school all of the time very easy and very accurate well designed digitally
B0063GORYU|5.0|Time flies when your mind is occupied and you're having fun. There is a lot of room for improvement.as  the game is not as simple as it appears.
B00BESM14U|4.0|Some pretty difficult topics, well done. I'd recommend this movie.  Love the line about accepting the love we think we deserve
B00AFROVQC|4.0|Was not familiar with this author.  Got the book out of boredom.  Several typo's in the book but it was a good read.  Actually having me excited about the next book.
B001P1MZNI|5.0|Great songs, but I think I like his comments to the crowd the best.  It almost feels like you are in the audience, drinking your martinis and enjoying the Chairman.  Highly, highly recommended.  Today it is available for $1.99. (2/26/13)  Wow!
B00123KEX2|4.0|Not as strong as an album as Van Halen I or Diver Down, but still an excellent album - a little darker with a little more raw guitar sound from Eddie.<br /><br />This is a must have for any Van Halen fan - Van Hagar fans may choose to pass, however.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book was a great book for its awesome plot and pace<br /><br />Sometimes the book had some things in it that made it slow but I still loved it
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|This movie kept me on the edge of my seat from beginning to end!! I've always been a 'James Bond fan, but with this one some questions were answered and now I have a new favorite 'Bond', sorry Sean!! :-)
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This book tells you everything inherently known about life. Truly an amazing an amazing read that opens your eyes to everything you're probably missing everyday.
B008220DGE|5.0|Is the only reason this film has the reviews that it does. It's excellent and Phoenix's performance is borderline amazing.
1616550414|5.0|I was surprised at how large/heavy this book was when I received it. It was a very thorough and comprehensive and even dared to make a chronological timeline of all the games.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Deserves all 5 stars just needs a wee bit better ending.  I loved the book, gave my wife a running commentary on his progress throughout his journey. Read it if you can.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I believe it is the casts personalities.  They are funny and even with a serious storyline, you come away feeling good.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this app is so awesome... any age will love to play. the graphics are awesome and it is awesome because it is so fictional it is so fun! if i could explain just how much i love this game i would but i cant.... i highly reccomend!!!! this is how u spell awesome jetpack joyride!! ( i know thats not actually how u spell awesome)
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Great movie! It gives new meaning to loyalty with pictures of what it looks lide; if only people could be so inclined.
B008220DIC|4.0|Great Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Joaquin Phoenix, Amy Adams is good but she really only has maybe 20 minutes of combined screen time.  Joaquin has some great freak outs where he fights anybody and everybody. I know there was some padding but there's a scene in the jail cell where he destroys everything in the cell, which is just great to see this super long take go with hardly any cuts.<br /><br />The story is about one man's journey, to grow up and stop lying to himself and being trapped by your own demons, it's a great character study movie, but I wanted more of the cult aspect, it's there, but I thought they could have done more with it.  I didn't feel it mirror scientology, if it did now that would have been a hell of a story.<br /><br />If you are into cinema photography, then this is the movie for you, there's great lighting through out, a lot of dark scenes that are really well lit.  Great cinematic scenic wide shots as well.<br /><br />As a fan I loved seeing Phillip Seymour Hoffman back being directed by PT Anderson, this is their fifth movie together and I love the combo.<br /><br />This movie had a good deal of sex references, of which I was fine with, but it was way more than I was expecting, and a good deal of full frontal nudity.  especially in one scene.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Excellent writing with whitty, the chapters in the far land are repetitive but not in a bad way, it became a little more action packed and the development of Kovthe and his party are enrichinf
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is really good for kids, it teaches responsibly without having to actually own a horse! I've always wanted a horse and this is a really good starter. No, it isn't a real horse, but it is virtual. Great game for girls!<br />Only down side is it's a little slow starting up but other than that great game, sound effects and visuals!
B007XIC1GI|5.0|I love Marilyn Manson, and reading his book just furthered my and knowledge for not only him but his music and life as well.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is the best app ever! I'm so addicted! It's for men and women. You could easily build a wedding or house just using pinterest. It's fun and easy to use. Get pinterest and get addicted!
B007PT1PEY|3.0|I love Sherlock Holmes.  I have several versions of all of the stories.  I thought having it on my Kindle would be a nice way to dip into the stories whenever and wherever I wanted.  However, without an index at least to the of order the stories, this is impossible.
B004V5A7K8|5.0|It's hard, and yet fun. If you like to challenge yourself this is the game for you. Speed increases with levels and each level is different. Love this game.
B008MM9630|4.0|I would recommend this game.  My daughter loves it.  It helps teach her responsibility for helping with chores like feeding the animals and helping around the farm.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I love my lifeproof, I don't have to worry about my Iphone getting ruined by my children. Buy buying it online, I paid half the price!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The best show out there. Love the movie. The whole family is intrigued.. So action packed. Just wonderful. Purchased it from Amazon because it is not other streamed programs we use.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app because I can see how long my kindle fire needs to charge or how long I can use it
B00007KWHG|5.0|Tell It To The Rain  One of her favorites, was not found easily.  She had every 45  every made.  when I found this CD with her favorites, knew she would love it<br /><br />Wanted a special gift for Christmas ,and this CD was it.  The collection thrilled her and I was so please.!!!
B0091LS07E|2.0|OMG.....I was incredibably DISSAPPOINTED by this one!!  Normally Alicia hits it 'ON POINT' but this time SHE TRULY missed the entire target.  TWO SONGS....count them &#34;2&#34; were great and everything else.... OMG (Badd)!
B007C4ZJ0S|4.0|Steven Soderbergh, the director of HAYWIRE, took a chance casting a mixed-martial arts star named Gina Carano in this movie released in January 2012.  It was her first film.  Carano plays an ex-Marine, now government assassin who turns rogue. Onscreen she's a cross between Linda Fiorentino (The Last Seduction) and Noomi Repace (The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo). As beautiful and raven haired as Fiorentino and as svelte and agile as Repace in black leather, Carano plays her role more like a Cyborg than a human. And she does her own stunts...great stuff.<br /><br />As Time film critic Richard Corliss writes in his review, this movie is \\"sooo 1940's.\\"  Yes, it's an \\"ingenious, old-school, thrill-a-minute\\" entertaining movie needing no special effects, loud sound track, wild car chases nor hand-held cameras. And it's filmed mainly in Ireland...with one segment in a luxury suite in The Shelbourne Hotel for a little glam.<br /><br />Gina Carano may be new to film-goers...but there's an impressive array of male superstars.  Michael Douglas, Ewan McGregor, Michael Fassbender, Antonio Banderas and Channing Tatum.  \\"...effervescent eye candy for guys and gals alike.\\"<br /><br />Critic Corliss sums up the action with a comparision to another popular action thriller: \\"It's James Bond vs. Rosa Klebb in the From Russia With Love train compartment.  Only you're rooting for Rosa...\\"<br /><br />Recommended as a summer movie to watch on a dreary winter day.<br />Jane
B004R13U6Y|5.0|I have never had a tablet.  I think I like it because my friend said was easy to learn.  So far it has been.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|While it was at first a bit confusing as to which app, e.g., Kindle, Amazon MP3, Amazon Apps, etc, I should use, once the MP3 download happened, it has been working fine. Have already been playing my old CDs bought years ago from Amazon thru our car\phone Bluetooth. Sounds as good as the CDs.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Ease of use - Excellent.<br />Enjoyment level - Love it!<br />This was my very first app and found the whole experience to be great!<br /><br />Eric D.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|So far Ive only watched 7 episodes but they have kept me captivated. I watch it with my 3 teenage boys who also seem to like it.
B009O2XY12|4.0|This game is addictive and one will enjoy trying to get to the next level. Once you get started you can't stop. Enjoy.
B007BT0RKG|1.0|There is no use for this version which  only uses this to get you to  buy pro version  stupid app.
B00A757EFW|4.0|I didn't think it would work due to playing it on a arcade machine. Instead this just as much fun and just as exciting as playing it on the machine.
B00BESLHEA|3.0|This was an OK movie.  Lots of martial arts and cool<br />weaponry.  Can't see how the Iron Fist dude could make<br />such advanced weapons given the time frame.  A lost<br />art to be sure.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I am OBSESSED over the Percy Jackson books, and the Heroes of Olympus. The book was do detailed and told (written) with SO much detail. This is a wonderful book Rick. K love the way you write. By the way, I am 10 years old ;)
B0055EAJ7A|5.0|After seeing The Avengers, I really wanted to see the origins of Thor. This movie did not disappoint. My kids love it as well.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|It is not the not the most fun game to play but it is ok when you are bored<br />If you like games that are slow here is one for you
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love the ability to know exactly how much power and usage I have.<br />The settings are particularly useful when switching from application to application.<br />I highly recommend this app.
B00APJLX8E|5.0|We watched this movie with our granddaughters (10 & 8) and thoroughly enjoyed it. It was clever and witty enough for us old folks but cute enough for the younger crowd. I would recommend this movie to everyone!!
B009IH0ICG|5.0|It holds the perfect amount for a Smokey Joe, or lit charcoal using the Minion method for the Weber Smoker or kettle.
B00BETX5PS|1.0|Juvenile production, no story , no plot, no production values etc. Total waste of time and money, even as a &#34;time waster&#34;. I am probably at fault for having expected any kind of value in this film other than mindlessness.
B008P1EWIM|3.0|I am not crazy about the layout of this app.  It is hard to navigate beyond just a glimpse of the day.
B004H4XDBI|5.0|This takes place 2-3 yrs after 'If I stay' ended. It's in Adam's point of view. He becomes a successful musician and Mia is in NYC -the story takes place over one night..where Adam and Mia reminisce about what brought them to that point in their lives. I love this book. It made me cry and smile and just feel the emotions through Adam. It's a must read! And kind of brings everything full circle.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book dives into a woman's most darkest places. Anastasia is me, she and I are kindred spirits. Thank you for writing this book!
B005PK1G76|5.0|Based on everyone's glowing feedback, I knew I had to get this one and sure glad I did. The price was a major factor. Pimpin up the baby stroller is an expensive proposition, so when I learned I could get one compatible with my Jogger Mini GT for fraction of the price and with more options, I couldn't resist. I use it for holding drinks and use the zipped pockets for keys/phone and the main compartment for various items. The alternatives could cost 3x more.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Great deal. Great movies. Look awesome godfather is a classic must own!!! Bluray made a classic even better the look the sound everything has been redone right. Great buy if you don't already own it.
B00770KR7W|4.0|My 7 year old loves this guy.  It has lots of detail and articulating joints.  More joints than expected and easy to pose, stand, aim, etc. Much like G.I. Joe of my day, but many joints are hidden. The only problem we have is the left foot front (yes, it also articulates) pops off with low to moderate pressure.  It's practically a miracle we still have the piece as he plays with it all the time amongst his lego and Halo pieces.  I saw another review with this problem but many that didn't, so perhaps we just got unlucky.  Still, a great toy.
B008Q0D9DG|3.0|I love baseball. I love baseball movies. I didn't see this until just recently, and it didn't live up to the hype. There were some very funny moments, but they were often far too predictable.
B00499NHLC|5.0|If you love mysteries, ans specially sherlock homes watch this series it has and excellent twists and it's witty, I highly recommend it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love it, love it !!!!  has great ideas, great pictures<br />everything you could possibly  want or think about<br />could spend all day on it
B009VSW15Y|5.0|Very easy to use and clear pictures. I love using this camera on my Kindle Fire HD. I would recommend!
B000EWBKM6|5.0|I wasn't always a fan of this show, but it grew on me.  This cast works great together.  I really enjoyed the episodes when Megan Mullally would become serious or more dramatic.  She pulled it off very well.  This finale has a great duet between Ms. Mullally and Mr. Hayes, and the script is on point with a practical and surprising ending.
B004EPZ034|5.0|My grandson is a Chipmunks groupie.  I ordered the product (and all the Chipmunk discs).  It came on time and he was a happy boy when he came to visit.
B000EWD1KK|3.0|I saw this movie many times when I was a child, and loved it.  However, now that I am older, it doesn't have the same charm as then.  Danny Kaye is great though.  It was worth it just to watch him.
B008FYZIVY|1.0|This product was supposed to be new but it had been previously viewed and Disc One wouldn't load.  Had to return it and there wasn't an option to receive a replacement.
B0013D6LEM|5.0|MJ jam session is in store, this classic album is a must have. Not sure what else to say but yeah
B003O86FMW|5.0|After reading the first book I didn't think there could be a better one but, there is and this one is it!
B00AFROVQC|4.0|I love this story.  It is a fantasy version of [[ASIN:B00B14B6R0 10 Miles to Ruin]].  Good action.  Great characters.  Fun read.  It's worth buying.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book is a &#34;Philosophy 101&#34; story of a young man making it through the trials and tribulations of religious life in India. There are many memorable quotes, relating to each of the three religions, Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam, that Pi adopts, and holds all at once. It makes the reader review his or her own religious life choices, and also the tendency we all have to  believe our own religious choice is superior to any other choices that others might make.<br /><br />The book is not just about religion, of course. It is a story of growing up, learning how the world works, and finding that razor's edge balance so rare in our lives, but abundant in Pi's. He uses the family zoo, and the interactions with animals, including the tiger he is stuck on a rowboat with, as metaphors for understanding humanity. There is a wild, almost Rabalasian humor that runs throughout the story, just underneath the surface. One has to &#34;read between the lines&#34; to see this, but it is there, and it is one of the things which makes the book so memorable. Along with strong story lines, it presents a marvelous and true-to-life view of modern urban India, which is often missing in Western minds.<br /><br />Perhaps one of the reasons I enjoyed the book so much is that I spent several years in India in my early post-college years, and visited all the places on my own that Pi mentions in the book. He describes Pondicherry and many other Tamil and Southern India sites and attitudes, including eating habits (with fingers rather than utensils), and how these become ingrained until one visits a different culture and finds they are mocked by that other culture.<br /><br />A beautiful book, that will remain in my top ten, alongside Plato and &#34;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,&#34; and only slightly under &#34;Hobbit,&#34; and &#34;Lord of the Rings.&#34;
B00BB8SKPW|1.0|I was completely unprepared for how bad the characters were in this movie. I ended up fast forwarding through the opening scenes hoping it would improve, but by the third or fourth encounter with what were truly pitiful characters, I'd had enough. Not my kind of movie, that's for sure. If you like a story that opens with titties, drug addicts, and alcoholics, go for it. Really bad movie, IMO. Ever since Training Day, I've had enough of Densel. Never again. His choice in character roles sucks. Big time. Buh-bye.<br /><br />UPDATE 11/10/2013: So I tried to watch this again now that it's available as an Amazon Prime movie, and I stand by my original review. I just could not get into this story at all. My apologies to Denzel. You are too good an actor to do this kind of crap. I absolutely loved The Book of Eli. Best movie you've ever done. So it's not you, it's your seemingly many bad choices in movie material.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|The movie itself was very good but even with the Kindle sound at its highest setting the sound was indistinct at times
B00AKOB7CG|3.0|Hard to see on my kindle, as it only works horizontally.  Have  used it some but not much. I'm glad it was free.
B00846F1YW|3.0|The story line is confusing, so that it's hard to care whether or not the mystery is solved. The puzzles are highly repetitive, but mildly entertaining. If I'd paid for it, I would have been really disappointed.
B009VSW15Y|2.0|Not very useful at all, how many times do you take your own picture.  Would not recommend. Will keep on kindle as I might find a future use for it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I chose five stars because I love reading  God word.l love it, and will recommend it and choose it again
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|We watch this movie every year on groundhogs day and eat groundhog stew.  I bought several copies for friends and family who want to carry on the tradition.
0385510454|3.0|Joel Backman is The Broker, a once-powerful Washington attorney who has his long jail sentence commuted by a pardon just a few days before President Morgan was to leave office. Backman is whisked away to Italy, where he is immersed in learning a new language and ostensibly hid from those trying to kill him.<br /><br />Backman was dropped in Bologna, Italy - a beautiful town that John Grisham loved so much that he made the town a character of this novel. The former power-broker was given a new identity and a new background. Days were consumed with classes in speaking Italian from a private tutor. Meals were eaten with his handler, a man named Luigi who shared few personal details with the protected Marco Lazzeri. In fact, all people hired to interact with Marco are warned to keep the relationship strictly professional. Not all do, but that is part of the charm of the story.<br /><br />Rather than feel protected, Backman senses his isolation. His first stop is a small Italian village named Traviso, but he is moved partly in an attempt to unnerve him, and partly because a man named Critz, a high-ranking member of the Morgan Administration, falls for a bribe to learn the location of Backman.  Critz is eliminated and Marco is swiftly shuttled to Bologna in a manner designed to frighten and intimidate him.<br /><br />The head of the CIA engineered the plan to free Backman. First, Ted Maynard wanted to drug Backman during his stay at a military base in Italy, in order to question him under the influence of sodium pentothal (truth serum) but Backman was too smart for that. They went ahead with the plan to hide Backman, but eventually the CIA would drop hints of his location through the international intelligence community in order to find out who would try to kill him. The CIA never understood the death of an associate of Backman, a senator named Jace Hubbard. Those who wanted Hubbard dead would kill Backman, Maynard reasoned, and such knowledge would help clear up a nagging concern of national security.<br /><br />Ted Maynard was previously introduced in the novel, [[ASIN:0385497466 The Brethren]].  In a way, The Broker is a sequel to The Brethren.  If you can, read The Brethren before reading this book.<br /><br />The plot is designed to induce an audience, perhaps lukewarm in sentiment to the main character, into siding with him. The former jailbird power-broker becomes one man battling for his survival in a strange town, while he is watched from many different angles. He can't trust anyone - yet the two people he does trust in Bologna do not let him down.<br /><br />The setting in Italy creates more of a distraction with the translation of languages than it adds to the story. Many Grisham novels take the reader inside an aspect of the legal profession, but such a journey is missing in this novel. Instead, Grisham discusses technology that he admits he only lightly understands.  Grisham's novels are more satisfying when he sticks to his expertise. The chase near the end of the novel made The Broker a legal thriller, Grisham's bread and butter type of book.
B008Y6TD5A|5.0|Very high action but with a good family ending. I really liked this movie so did my husband I would watch.it agian.
B009RH973I|5.0|Love it!!  I thought it would be more sturdy but overall is great!  Would recomend.  Just make sure when you order that it is the correct size!  I ordered the smaller one and had to send back.. no problem with exchange.. went very smooth.
B003UYUQZW|5.0|We love this movie. We went out of our way to find this and buy it. The story is great and the acting was done well. This is an excellent move for those who love action and a story. We love movies where the characters are better because of their experiences and this story shares that.
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|This movie surprised me - it has a very good story line and a fantastic ending.  I would recommend it to anyone who loves a good edgy thriller.
B008CLI4N4|4.0|My husband wanted this for x-mas so I got it for him.  He liked it and I was ok with it.  Definitely an HBO show not regular TV - nudity galore and some vulgarity - not for younger kids.
0240815807|5.0|The first clue this book is valuable is the star ratings versus the used book price. Why do you think used copies sell for nearly as much as new? And what's the percentage of 5 stars? Those two indicators led to my purchase. Admittedly, I thought the price was steep but after reading I think it's a steal.<br /><br />Senior's book has a very logical flow and seems to consider absolutely every challenge mixers face. You will get the most from this book starting at the beginning and working your way through it, cover to cover. It's a very concise book and will require time to read because it never let's up giving you valuable information.<br /><br />I am a little at a loss for words in trying to explain how great the book is. All I can say is I've been writing music for over 15 years and have gotten better mixes through a lot of painful, time-consuming trial and error. I know what doesn't work because of MANY failures. But then I start reading this book and see Senior knows those same failures and offers the same logical solutions that worked for me. Even simple things like color coding tracks to quickly get around your mix can shoot the inexperienced in the foot, but here it is called out for you. The tips are endless and, again, the value of this book is somewhat immeasurable. Senior could make a fortune giving endless seminars just touching single chapters.<br /><br />My take from the book, and this will not sit well with some newbies, is that mixing is still a very hands-on, labor intensive art in its' own right. We live in a world where programmers offer us a bewildering array of affordable equipment past engineers would have sold their house for and could only dream of. Many new to mixing assume the software is the solution in and of itself and blame the programmers when things don't go as dreamed. Some keep buying plugins and add-ons looking for the golden sound solution and when those don't work they believe that if they only could afford what the pros work ontheir mixes could compete with commercial studios, but the fact is, again, human skill still has the edge. It's painful to know you can't just turn on auto tune and let it run unminded to correct a pitch. It's painful to know your expensive monitors leave you with nothing exciting if you don't know what you're listening for. It might also be painful to realize some songs, no matter who the mixer, can't be fixed because the arrangement is boring, confusing, not musical or too busy. But that's where this book is a Godsend. Rather than tinker at a problem until you lose your hair you can read this book which clearly spells out what you can do, what you probably can't and what you'd be a fool to undertake. Even better, the advice can be applied to a wide variety of set-ups and budgets.<br /><br />I've read the handful of low ratings and I see the same pattern- readers with unrealistic expectations and not enough patience to mix. That said, I'm not sure how anyone could rate the book so low and expect commercial (or even slightly good) mixing results. The book won't move the faders for you. To them I'd say they might be better off hiring a professional mixer.<br /><br />A million 'thank you's' to Mike Senior for this comprehensive and immensely helpful book. Seriously, if you're reading this I want you to know you've set the (very high) standard for this topic and I owe you a drink.<br /><br />Another million thanks to the editor (very succinct, great flow) and to the publisher for bringing this work to us.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is great game for my two girls with activities galore._Also teaches my girls strategy by picking the right thing at right time in right order.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I cried. Undoubtedly the most fantastic book I have ever read. I cannot fathom what these teens go through. Very well written.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Great app for browsing my server and files on it and for copying and pasting and general file Exploring.  It's soooo good that I dream about it and whilst awake.
B003K1EYM6|4.0|I dont have much to say except that it works very well with my ipad. it is very easy to use. thanks
B0030F5W5K|5.0|I can watch this over and over again!  It has many funny areas but also some that are sad. They were so deeply in love! It was the first time that my kids watched it and they liked it a lot.
B00012QM8G|5.0|Schindler’s List is more than your everyday Nazi film. I’ve seen it about 10 times and every time I see something new in it. Always cry at the last scene. I’ve even saw it dubbed in German where the lines are altered, not interpreted, making it a different movie.<br /><br />Freaky resemblance Fiennes and Neeson have to there actual characters.<br /><br />I recommend &#34;Inheritance&#34;, Amon Goeth's daughter Monika Goeth Hertwig documentary for deeper insight.
B0094K1JPC|5.0|I thought it was very funny. My kids also thought it was funny. It has a good cast, Harrison Ford plays his character very well. Rachel McAdams is a very spunky hard working person who wants to get to the top but needs Harrison's help.
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|The film has gorgeous customs and scenes are beautiful in an artistic sort of way but the took the depth and drama out of the story. Tolstoy would be pissed off.
B004G600A4|5.0|Great music!!  A little dark at times for my four year old we had to watch it the first couple of times totally skipping the kidnapping in the beginning and mother knows best scene, but now she loves dancing and singing to the music so much she quickly gets over the couple moments she doesnt like in the movie. As with all Disney movies there is a happy ending.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Denzel Washington at his best. Great story. Denzel takes the character to the max. Sometimes you love him, then you hate him.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|This movie is full of violence, swear words, sex, racism, and all that are not appropriate for a movie with a teddy bear. This is one of the greatest failure of a movie I've seen. I hope this kind of stuff does not get propagated any more.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I want more of this series. The story just keeps getting better. I've seen seasons 1 to 3 and I can't wait for 4
1616550414|5.0|I love this book, if you are a fan of Zelda, it is a definite must buy! The art work is awesome!
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I find his game quite entertaining because of it's different levels and cute bad guys. Please try this game. It's pretty cool.
B007IK44CK|5.0|breathtaking stunts, I love seeing different places, although for sure they shoot/film some part of it in a studio. This is a very good movie.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Enjoyed getting a profesional experience, a Brain Surgeon no less. Truly interesting!<br />Makes you wonder if we pull the plug so to speak far too soon.
B000QI2ZWW|5.0|The story is great, the music and dance fabulous I just loved it!!!  I now have happy feet too!!!  Not just for kids ;)
B00B9J05CO|3.0|Some of the cat sounds are exactly right and some are not. I thought some were a little short as well. The ones that are done well certainly got my cats' attention when I tried it on them. I would recommend this app if you are looking for 2 or 3 different cat sound effects.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This game is so fun!!!!  I highly recommend it.  There are a lot of free puzzles to pick from.  I like that you can pick how many pieces you want to make it easier or harder.
B001EC2IV2|5.0|I watched it on the silver screen many years ago and loved it. Just got the video and still love it. I highly recommend it. Great action movie.
B00BHU9BV6|4.0|Need to have sub titles, lots of dialog gets missed. Please tell me, is there some way to set  them?
B00116FT6M|5.0|The musical came highly recommended to me. It is an all-star cast. Just didn't realize John Travolta was going to be playing the &#34;mom&#34;. I highly recommend the movie as well.
B004J2TPSI|5.0|This bluetooth adapter makes it very easy to create a connection between a sending unit and receiver. Seem just simple and cost effective
B00004YA66|5.0|How many times have we wanted to be able to go back and talk with our loved ones?  Say things we wish we could have said?  Great movie............:0)  Surprise ending...........Would recommend this to anyone............Well worth the price.........Great story!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|This one was like a Cinderella story. Too Much fluff. More drama would bave been good. To predicatable. We knew Christian could buy Ana everything she wanted like the fabulous mansion.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME, IT IS AWESOME AND VERY EASY TO PLAY!!!! ONCE YOU GET STARTED WILL NOT WANT TO STOP!!!
B0058RN85O|5.0|Laughing so hard I cried. Love this show and the characters interactions. The show lets you laugh at the dysfunction of family life. It's decently worth buying. I could watch it over and over again.
B009O2XY12|3.0|I bought it though my kindle for my kindle.  Played approx 2 min then the screen said it was for pc's.  Cut off and never came back on the kindle or on the pc.  $2.99 that I can't use!!!
B00BHU9BV6|5.0|This movie was so awesome, I loved it!! It was fantastically done, the costumes were magnificent and Keira Knightley was fantastic! Absolutely love, love, LOVED this movie!!!!
B009KHCT94|4.0|Total camp, never takes itself seriously, yet at the end it actually managed to make a point.  Lots of laughs and also something to think about.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This bookcaptures you from beginning to end. Very interesting perspective, lovely book. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I saw my friend playing it and I got and got very addicted to it . works on the kindle fire well.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book had so many twists and turns really keeps you turning the pages, you really feel for the characters and start to see how it all comes together, a great book
B009GQ57ES|5.0|You may have heard of Thrift Shop, and well that song is good, it grossly misrepresents the entirety of this album. This album is so much more personal: Macklemore preaching about life and Ryan Lewis complementing with an incredible beat.  The lyrics are meaningful and it's a very very good album.  Definitely worth buying and listening to.
1616550414|4.0|they came in a very short time the book is in a really good state the only thing is that the book its a little damage by the sides
B007R86B9C|5.0|I'm sad that I missed these guys when they were killin back in the early 2000s. Arcarsenal is just the greatest intro ever and it just gets better from there. I'm trying to listen to Vaya right now, but i keep coming back to Relationship of Command for my fix. solid release from a legendary band.
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|This is a nicely-built hallway light. Nothing fancy - just an LED light source that is controlled by a sensor so that it lights up a hallway at night without the need to turn on the overhead lights. It operates on 4 AA cells (the batteries are not included). I'm using rechargeable Amazon Basic batteries without any problem.<br /><br />The light is more than bright enough to light up the hallway so I can see where I'm going. In fact, if you're close enough to the light, there's enough light to read by. It has a plastic diffuser over the LEDs that softens the light so it's not blinding if you look directly into the lens. There's also a switch on the front so you can switch from auto mode to always on.<br /><br />It mounts on the wall with screws that go into keyhole slots on the back. It's rather heavy when loaded with 4 AA's, so I'd recommend using the supplied screws and wall anchors rather than any type of stick-on fastener.<br /><br />The sensor is very effective. I have it mounted high on the wall so that it is triggered by a person walking by and not triggered by a cat. The sensor only turns it on when it is dark -- it won't turn on during the day (great for saving battery power).<br /><br />Works well and a good value for the price. Highly recommend.<br />[The manufacturer provided this for review]
B005I548B4|3.0|Quite dissappointed really.  Almost trashy! Not his best story line or telling of a story infact it reads more like a movie script - as f he wrote it with movie production in mind!  I would prefer Nicholas to stick to story telling in his old style!
B004GYY714|4.0|Had the station I wanted. It does drop a signal altho that may be the phone and not the software.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This a very responsive game which. is good since that is what you should want out of a game like this
B001UGB1X8|4.0|I did like this movie, but you really need to pay attention to the dialog. Some of the accents can be hard to understand and with all the story twists, you need every line to follow along. I missed the first 5 minutes and ended up stopping it and going back to the beginning to catch it all. I will probably watch this again.
B00846REIS|5.0|I quickly purchased the sequel &#34;Reflected in you&#34; and am bummed that the sequel to that &#34;Entwined in You&#34; doesn't come out until June 2013!
B007QDNKQA|5.0|Can't help but love Wahlberg's character in this one, as a retired Marine taking on corruption in the US Government. (What?!) Action packed and clear lines between the good and the evil. Everything in it is plausible and not outside of your belief of what &#34;real life&#34; people might do in the same situations. It's nice to see the good guys win for a change.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This game is ridiculously addicting.  I can't put it down!!!  I have downloaded several versions and each is as fun as the last!
B00BLGZDVS|2.0|Didn't really get it.  First half better than second. Kind of appears to portray Scientology/LRH.  Parts didn't make sense.  Mixed drinks were funny.
B009K0P10K|5.0|You never know who is going to be attacked or who is to blame.  Can't wait to see the next episode.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|After a fairly disappointing second season, I was pleasantly surprised with Season 3. Although I wish the Governor would take a long walk off a short pier, I am loving all the new characters and their development. I don't want to say too much so I spoil the show, but if Season 2 left you lacking after an awesome Season 1, come back to Season 3. You must see what happens to Rick. :)
B00632HWOG|1.0|im almost 25 and it says im to young to go on so don't even waste your time on this retarded app
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The book was different than Nicholas Sparks other novels, adding the element of fear and surprise. I thought it was a great read, I couldn't put it down!!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Absolutely LOVE this &#34;App.&#34;  I use it daily on my Kindel  and it gives instant updates on sales, status, and messages from ebay.  Highyly recommend it to others.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Clear, easy to read.  Works with Nexus 7, Android Jelly Bean.  Haven't explored everything it does yet, but so far I'm quite satisfied.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|It works great on both.  It allows me to focus in on the bad weather where friends and family are located.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I enjoyed this book more than any I have read in a long time.  It had romance and suspense all through the book.  It proves you can escape from domestic abuse and find happiness.  I would highly recommend this book to everyone.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|In all honesty I was anti the movie from the start but I love tigers.  They are amazingly beautiful but very dangerous animals.  So I watched it because of the tiger.  I am not sure if I would have enjoyed it as much if it had not been a tiger.  Maybe so.  The story is well written and told.  It is in someways about redemption of the soul.  It is about God's mighty hand.  It will make you think and an ending that leaves you wondering.  It is an amazing movie.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It has Been very entertaing when bored! Lol you should try it. Lol lol lol hats this fourteen word thingy on here..
1250027624|5.0|For anyone who loves Downton Abbey, this is a must. It follows the characters into the third season and highlights the main ones.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I hesitated about purchasing this book but boy was I surprised. This was an exceptional read. The story grabs you and won't let you go. Very well told story that keeps you totally in its grasp. You can't wait to read what will happen next and what will be done to solve the problem. At the end of the book I was so on edge as to what would happen that I could hardly sit still. I have to applaud the author. I have never had a book equal the suspense, via words,  felt in a great movie. Excellent, excellent, excellent.
B0094K1QR8|5.0|THIS WAS A GOOD MOVIE. A GOOD LOVE STORY IS ALWAYS REFRESHING.<br />NEEDS TO HAVE A FOLLOW UP MOVIE.<br /><br />RMC
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Just like all the books before.<br />Recommend this book for all ages.  Can't wait for the next one in the series.
B003UYUP58|5.0|Very well written. This book holds your interest and is very educational. Ihave been recommending it to all my friends.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My horse is a great and terrific game  I can take care of a3D horse and unlock diffrent games to take care of my horse also I can groom ,feed , compete, and train the horse that I am taking care of . I love this game.
B005RUUUAI|4.0|The best TV show of this type , better then most big screen horror movies. good rotation of the charactors.
B0009A21R6|5.0|Simply a must have for your SACD collection!<br /><br />Highlights for me:<br /><br />&#34;Why Worry&#34; Sounds like the backing vocals are in your living room.  Right behind you!<br /><br />&#34;Ride Across the River&#34; This song screams surround sound!  While it sounds awesome I felt they could have played around a bit more with the surround.<br /><br />&#34;Brothers in Arms&#34; Just perfect with the soundscapes and guitar.<br /><br />&#34;Walk of Life&#34; Nice to hear the rhythm guitars up a bit.<br /><br />Overall, just a classic album to have.  Chuck Ainlay did an excellent job.  One of the few engineers who can mix in 5.1.  All the songs are fantastic.  Bring on the rest of the albums in 5.1!<br /><br />My SACD setup: Sony BDP-S590/Yamaha RX-V373
B000JQU1VS|5.0|Whatever your age, the Sherlock Holmes stories never fail to entertain. This is a nice presentation of Conan Doyle's short stories.
B005804N4Q|5.0|As a newcomer to SACD I could just kick myself for not buying them when they came out as prices have insanely increased.  So now I tend to poke around to see if I can find any good albums for a reasonable price.  I was thrilled to find out Warner-Japan reissued an SACD version.  I was a fan ever since hearing New Frontier and the video they used to constantly play on MTV.  This is Fagan at his finest.  Every song is great.  The musicianship is impeccable featuring some of NYC's finest.  Mixed in 5.1 by legendary engineer Elliot Scheiner.  A must have for your SACD collection!  Get it now before they increased by 500%!<br /><br />My SACD setup: Sony BDP-S590/Yamaha RX-V373
B006OCM0G0|4.0|This app is really fun,its good time for just taking a break from the hustle of real life.Kindle doesn't give the good updates thats why I gave it 4 stars.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|It wasn't the best movie I have ever seen, but very entertaining. I love Denzel Washington, and he did a great job, as always.
B0058YPILY|5.0|This was a awesome season. Now I want to get more!! I recommend getting this and more seasons to add to your video library!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is a very fun game it tells you how to treat a horse in real life its awesome
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Page turner from start to finish. I think it touches on every type of relationship there is...the good and the bad ones.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|I verymuch enjoyed the movie and more so when I realized that it's based on a true story. I thought both Helen Hunt and John Hawkes did an outstanding job in it.
B005ISZRES|3.0|Haven't read it yet but wanted to have it available -- it was a favorite book from my childhood & I'd like to have it where I can easily access it.
1439190275|5.0|Recipes and Advice all in one. It makes understanding and starting this lifestyle change more manageable. One step at a time to a healthier year.
B005ZI3E46|5.0|No review, purchased as a gift, recipient wanted this particular item. . . . . . . . . .
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|So happy to be able to download so I could go on reading right away after finishing Book 2 -- I enjoyed the series.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|The regular FB app works better than any other app for FB.  I use it on my phone both personal and for work.  Now it is on my tablet.  Love it.
082221718X|5.0|I'm working on this play, bought this edition to try to find differences in the various editions... . . . . . .
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Informative, intelligent and interesting.  It was sympathetic to the times without being sappy.  It kept me wanting to read until the end.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Finished the first book in print and desperately needed the second one right away!  Great to be able to get it on the Kindle app so quickly.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Excellent app essential to ascertain battery life. Should be a function inbuilt for androids and kindle fire.everyone should have one.
B004UJAOLM|3.0|Haven't read it yet -- downloaded for future reading. . . . . . . . . . . . .
B000JMKQX0|5.0|It was very well done. First time reading that style of writing. If you like zombies and end of the world this book is a must.
B000WN60NG|3.0|Great music, those sequences are entertaining,  some of the intrigue is bit much.  The whole scene in the hotel was not necessary and disturbing, and could have conveyed the problems with life on the road w/o showing so as much.
B0026QC0YU|2.0|Not at all what I thought it was going to be.  Maybe because it's so old and dated now. Definitely not as good as any of the Bourne movies.
B000W93CHC|5.0|if you're in a mood to get away from all the detective and suspense novells, this is thee right choice. I experienced every emotion I have every had in my life. I loved the historical elements and could relate to all the changes that take place over the subjects lifetimes. Many things can be viewed in todays world view of religion and medcine. It's a long read but hard to put down.
0525953728|4.0|This is a book about the special forces and the Navy Seals who trained for a special mission and when called upon by the President these men went into action and completed their mission.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This is one of my favorite TV series and knowing it's a PBS makes it even more enjoyable. The characters are super. I received it before the scheduled time and in perfect shape
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I am able to access my desktop from where ever I am as long as my cell signal is strong enough.
B000HAB4KS|5.0|The Matrix is an interpretation of Plato's cave allegory.  Beware.... Philosophy is a dangerous set of pursuits.  Do not let Athens sin a second time....
B0058VW36U|5.0|It is a great way to have fun for a little bit. My daughter let me play hers first, then I got my own Kindle.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Being a fan of the Irish, I found this book very interesting and absorbing. Scenes from the orphanage were enlightning
B001TCHDPS|5.0|He is the other Dylan.....worth the time to just &#34;listen&#34; to it. Watch the &#34; Sugarman&#34; movie. It is what drives you to get both his CD's.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|The story was a heart wrenching tale of what a girl has to go through while trying to find a family to love her while also going from family to family in the foster system.  Just as I thought she was going to make it, I felt myself feeling for her as she couldn't cope with the good in her life.<br />The story jumps from her as a young girl to the present time and back.  It was confusing at first, but the correlation began to make sense shortly into the read.
B00755646W|5.0|I realy dont care what others say. This was Madonna at her prime. One of the best eras in muisic that I wished I have lived in. The picture quality is great, the music sounded awesome. Get it if you are a true Madonna fan.
B008Y5OW20|5.0|Wonderful, sounds great, great shape, glad we ordered it, my husband loves it, would order more as gifts for family and friends
0547884591|5.0|I found many new and old ways to cook just about anything that you want.  Many good recipes to work with and the how too.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have enjoyed using this app since I started. So many great and thought provoking reading plans are available and there's a plan to relate to anyone. Grow in wisdom and scripture at any stage in your walk w God as I did. For the first time in my life,  I have been successful and encouraged in reading my Bible everyday, thanks to this app. Enjoy!
B009E3EXMU|5.0|This is so amazing! This is the best Led Zeppelin album ever! Worth every penny! Watching the concert DVD, it was sooo good, I cried. Yes, I'm a serious Zeppelin fan. Every Zeppelin fan should have this and even those who are just semi fans should have it, it's incredible!
B0086700CM|5.0|I rarely play games on my phone or Kindle but this one is fantastic! Smooth play, great visuals and it gets pretty intense. Not a game to play just before bed (gets your adrenaline pumping). I can't wait to download the sequel!
B009ESIGHI|5.0|My son really enjoyed this video-  great sound and picture quality.  Fun for the whole family.  Would buy as a gift for others.
0345803485|5.0|I loved everything about the book and the shipment, service, price, packaging. Everything was perfect. Looking forward to the other two books.
B00BHU9BV6|4.0|A lot of reviewers seem to be down on Keira Knightley, but I thought she did a good job playing the mercurial, alluring Anna. The &#34;stage-play&#34; conceit of this adaptation might be off-putting to some, but I thought it was innovative and artistically well done. This is an easy-to-watch, airy take on a story that is often played for grim, plodding melodrama. I recommend it.
B001EBV0MG|5.0|This has got to be the best of the best (in my opinion) of Newman's works.  The movie forces the mind to flow between tragic, hilarious, despair, horror, fear, defeat, victory, etc. in a constant wave of smooth velvet.  Cool Hand Luke is a timeless classic that depicts humanity at it's worst and it's best in the most caustic of atmospheres.  I love this movie.
B009NX409M|5.0|I've seen this movie many times & never get tired of watching it.  It's a must if you like a great love story.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love it, and so does my daughter. We find ourselves competing against each other on separate devices. Look forward to seeing more backgrounds.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I found the game entertaining and engaging. It was worth the price. I just wish it was longer! Can't wait for the sequel. I really like G5 games too.
0345803507|1.0|I've enjoyed reading the first two books in the series. Though they are definitely not well-written, they are entertaining, and so I was excited to read this last book. Just finished it and wow...what a disappointment. I almost wish I had stopped with the second. Don't want to spoil anything, but an event that occurs in this third book COMPLETELY rips off Stephanie Meyer (I didn't mind the similarities between the series thus far). Wow though. Lost much respect for the author.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Anyone a fan of Walking Dead will be as captivated as I was. Cant wait to buy the dvd when it comes out.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|AWESOME!!!!!!! Best books I've ever read. I couldn't put them down read all three in a week a month ago and thinking about rereading them.
B008J2GAKU|4.0|Great art. Great story. Well put together. I wish it was a few pages longer. A new villain emerges amount the classic foes of the Barman.
B0083Z6AH6|3.0|It's no Pride and Prejudice, mainly because the style is strained and nearly unbearable for the first ten or twelve chapters. I could sense the writer struggling against writer's block or imagination failure or something, and it took forever to plod through the staggering, wordy, pieced-together writing of the first third of the book. I doubt it would ever have made it past the slop pile nowadays. A second or third draught might have been a good idea.<br /><br />Anne was very wise and introspective, and while it works great later in the story, in the beginning, I came about half an inch from reaching into the book and cuffing her a good one. Seriously, quit with the pity party Miss Elliot and quit sabotaging yourself.<br /><br />Seems that there were quite a lot of serendipitous plot engines, too. I had a wee bit of trouble suspending my disbelief in some of the more convenient circumstances that occurred later on, and while a little bit of coincidence is never a bad thing, when multiple instances of situations reading like they were manufactured with the express purpose of working out something mentioned no more than two pages (or paragraphs) back, I start to feel like I'm being forced at gun point over a rickety bridge of plot points rather than being gently guided along a carefully crafted path of meticulously arranged thoughts to the inevitable, but still rewarding conclusion.<br /><br />If you have to read this for some strange reason, I'm sorry for you. You'll have to commit to the beginning. If you're reading for leisure, suffer chapters one and perhaps two, then skim the next eight or ten. You won't miss too much, and the writing becomes much more tolerable thereafter. And, if I'm wrong and you find yourself lost, skip to the last three chapters, because they're all anyone ever read this book for to begin with, and you'll get a fairly good summation of it therein.
0763655465|5.0|This book is short and sweet! My kids love it and it makes a true dog lover laugh! We have been looking at puppies and are thinking of naming it George now thanks to this book!
B002EMESSM|5.0|This is a classic movie.  It's fun to watch compared to current movies to see what the differences in focus were back when this movie was made.  Focus is definitely on art and &#34;moving&#34; slower scenes, compared to the fast action of today.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series has been a great adventure for me.  I recommend it to anyone who has lived in England because it gives an idea of what the word &#34;snobbish&#34; really means.  There really is a culture that lives with the general attitude stated in this series.  Hopefully this aristocratic attitute will change in the future.  The series has opened my eyes that there is good and bad in both the lords, ladies and the worker-a-bee's.  The acting in this series is superb and bringing in a favorite of mine, Ms Shirley McClain really brought this show to a new height.  I'm sure the next season is going to impress me even more.  I'm not sure which direction it is going to take since we've killed off two major characters after the birth of their children, however, I'm really looking forward to the next season.
B004EFYZ1C|4.0|This is wotth buying if you love anything to do with heavenly bodies..Yhe one over our little planet especially..<br />I give him a 9 .5 on this application .. Always room for improvement.
0525953728|5.0|Intense, sad, exciting, and funny at times.  Well written - personally as a 25 year veteran of the USMC and now the USAF, I'm glad he set the record straight.  He reminds us that if you're looking for secrets, you won't find it in this book, but you will find some really exciting Seal training and real world missions.  i couldn't put it down...  I've passed it around to 8 or 9 of my fellow servicemen/servicewomen and they all love it.<br /><br />God Bless you Mark Owen (AKA Matt Bissonnette) and what you have done for our country.  I hope you are able to heal and be a peace in this world, until your last day.  You deserve much respect.
B004OZOTSQ|3.0|It could be me but It needs maybe a little more input from the maker on set up..<br />I am sure when everything jells, it will be great//
0316044695|5.0|I spent 9 years in the USMC and 16 more now in the USAF (lifer!).  I've seen some stuff in my 25 years service, but I sleep better at night after reading this book.  Very humble author and well written.<br /><br />God Bless Marcus Luttrell for his combat actions against the enemy.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|An interesting take on the making of psycho.Anthony Hopkins was great as Alfred Hitchcock.Helen Mirren and Scarlett Johannson were also very good.
B0049VZ222|5.0|Great Acting.. and very realistic story line. The continual suspense is riveting. If you a fan of either, Action & Adventure, Suspense, and or horror.. you will absolutely LOVE this show.
0316056898|5.0|I find myself literally laughing out loud throughout. I like that she is candid and herself. I just love Tina Fey!
B001GJ9GG8|5.0|Any movie with Sean Connery is amazing. The plot twists and turns are great and the views aren't bad either
B0060CXAHC|5.0|I fun movie of the broken family that pulls together to stay together. Even with the help an odd ball (puppy) helping.
B002O2THRO|5.0|Nice to see the actors I grew up with in their prime. Filmed actually in Newport, RI at the Breakers Mansion.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This a good man's story both about him protecting our freedom and learning to be a fathet and husband after war. He will be missed by many.
B0050VA428|5.0|Over the years, I have seen various versions of this story on television, but it was nice to read the original.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game and I have it for the Computer and Xbox360 and now I have it on my tablet.  I'm really disappointed because it wouldn't let my brother download it but over all it's a good game.
B000FC12YQ|4.0|I am glad that I read this mystery and hope to eventually get more as they become available on the Kindle.
140053271X|5.0|I had to give a gift to a family friend of mine who has very badly deformed hands (due to arthritis and surgeries) which makes holding a book hard for her. I knew she was an avid reader when she had better hands.<br /><br />Instead of following suite with getting scarves, blankets, and stuff she may have filled a closet with, I looked into an e-reader.<br /><br />This was simple to use, she can tap to flick to the next page, easy to hold, and the price was right. I pre-loaded it with books of genres she loved and an AC wall charger. She was so overwelmed to have it and has been enjoying it.<br /><br />My grandfather leaned over Christmas morning after she opened it and said to me &#34;She never gets anything special these days. I've never seen her any happier to be able to read again. I think you have gotten the most thoughtful gift ever today.&#34;
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Sometimes painful view of America's history and the injustices before the slaves were freed.  All in all a fast read, great historical information, a poignant story.
B00APUQRPC|3.0|This movie was very predictable from the beginning.  If you want a relaxing evening with no excitement; this would be the movie to watch.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Lots of fun and its surprisingly realistic for kids my seven year old sister was afraid of horses till she played with this app
B000YHG72E|5.0|We all know Elf is a modern must have Christmas movie - it's a favorite for my whole family. Will Ferrell is hilarious without being crass.
B0050SYS5A|1.0|doesnt quite work like its supposed to.  With the zoom attached it is hard to control the games but without it attached the kinect works perfectly.  My personal opinion is this product is a waste of money.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Not one time was I bored nor did I lose interest.  I never thought I would be willing to pay for TV shows but I can't wait for Season 4.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|I don't think this book was as good as others in this collection. Took me awhile to get into it, but once you do it gets much better.
B005SAJJHM|5.0|This makes my husband and me both laugh out loud.  Before any grammar Nazis correct my use of &#34;and me&#34;, this actually is correct.  The rule is, if you would use the word &#34;I&#34; if you were only talking about yourself, you use &#34;I&#34; talking about yourself and others.  Hence, &#34;I went dancing&#34;, &#34;She and I went dancing&#34;.  If, however, you would use the word &#34;me&#34; if the sentence referred only to yourself, you use &#34;me&#34; referring to yourself and at least one other person.  Hence, &#34;This makes me laugh out loud&#34;, &#34;This makes my husband and me laugh out loud&#34;.  You don't say &#34;This makes I laugh out loud&#34;.  Or if you do, you are wrong, wrong, wrong.  And of course, you always list yourself last.  BTW, I am doing Amazon a favor by rating their products.  Why are they requiring me to name my review and then give additional verbiage?
B0083Z614S|4.0|This was recomended to me by my neice,  a good novel for young teenagers.  It was sad but ended happy.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|excellent story of a man, a soldier, and a father.  Great insight into what our military had to endure day in and day out.
B000FCK65W|5.0|I don't know how this wonderful book had eluded me for so many years.  I am so glad I've read it.  Because I have a Kindle version and can't loan it, I have bought paperback editions for my daughters and granddaughters.  I can't say enough about it: it is just a great book.
B00AN0KBJC|3.0|The show itself is good, price is ok, but there were two major drawbacks to getting the instant download version:<br /><br />1) You CANNOT play the version on any android devices except the kindle fire. One of the major reasons I bought the show is so I could watch it on my Asus tablet while commuting. Why Amazon, why? This is deal breaker as far as me buying shows from you in the future.<br />2) No english subtitles, British accents can be difficult to understand, and I prefer to read what they are saying, I could not find this feature anywhere. Amazon, please add an option for subtitles in your video player.
B005HSL626|4.0|fun and addictive.  I like the Zen mode best, but the classic is good too.  Had seen some of my students playing it, it looked interesting.
