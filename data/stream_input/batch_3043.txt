B00FAPF5U0|2.0|I really like Candy Crush and am thrilled that it is now available for Kindle Fire.  Only negative seems to be how sluggish it is most of the time.  Hope that improves.
B00EMGUR60|5.0|Mot&ouml;rhead have been on an upward swing since 2000 with We Are Mot&ouml;rhead.  Aftershock is a crowning achievement on par with some of their best.  Ace Of Spades is their popular favorite however, Iron Fist was even better in my opinion and Aftershock feels like a second part to that album.  It kicks you in the face right from the start and never lets up.  Old fans will love it and it's actually an album I'm fairly confident would serve well as a gateway release for new fans.<br /><br />Get it immediately, Lemmy commands you to do so.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I was excited to see this in the appstore finally since I had fun playing it on Facebook it is a really fun and addictive game.
B00E9ZFIMM|2.0|This is so basic it's sad.  Make a note, type some words, and that's  it.  On a system can and should include Google Keep, stripped down basic things like this app serve no purpose at all.  It's not bad, and it doesn't appear to be spyware in disguise, it's just pointless.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I love this book and I would recommend it to everybody and anybody who wants to read I  I love this series if books!!
B00BMR4RIG|4.0|Nice app shows you the weather for the week and that day, it is also run by GPS  and will see if it works when I take my kindle with me to the Caribbean
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|I Have  so many apps but this  is the only one that really works for real<br />I am in love with this app
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game that is finally available to play on my Kindle Fire. It's free which makes it even better. Highly recommend.
B00122ORBI|4.0|It's a very dramatically relaxing album, good before bed with a book. It was a tad expensive but the quality is great.
B00EVW013E|5.0|Good movie. Its funny that Olympic has fallen both came out around the same time. good job Hollywood for that one
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|this book is so touching sad and happy. This book is bitter sweet. Best book in the world. It is awesome
B0071XO8RA|5.0|One of the best Sci-Fi books I've read in a long time. Well developed characters and a simple yet ingenious premise make for a great read. I couldn't stop reading, this is everything that Sci-Fi is at its best, its about great characters not lasers, spaceships, and other tropes of the genre. Though those can be okay too, this is better.
B00D3NSDVO|5.0|Couldn't put it down. smart, mysterious, beyond interesting, gives insight into religious beliefs & conflicts of our modern world in a fabulous set of stories & characters who are all so very realistic. Thanks for an amazing read
B003G4W49C|4.0|Despite high praise I was not that interested in this book. I read it at the insistence of a friend and I'm glad I did. I couldn't put it down.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been looking for candy crush saga on the kindle for months and I have now took long enough thanks for it can't wait to play
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|I have already downloaded the next book. This book keeps you in suspense until the last page. I appreciate the mild romance...passion. Without pages of sex scenes,
B006LSZECO|2.0|This books Starts quickly and looks like a lot more fun than it ends up being.<br />The author Commits the cardinal sin of having the entire cast of characters be unlikeable and the principal characters be very unlikeable and just truly evil. This is Presumably some sort of musing about the deficiencies and self deceptions of marriage  but it spirals up and  over the top in the first half and grinds  to a non -ending ending that is really quite bad. A skillful waste of. time so save your dime.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I just started playing, but so far not bad. The directions for the delivery trucks was vegue but I figured it out. I don't like the energy you have to use to get even buildings moved but I'll learn to set up my town effectively. I also don't like having to save and save just to get different houses.
B002OMZTSU|5.0|Like many people in America, I discovered Craig Ferguson when he played Mr. Wick on \\"The Drew Carey Show.\\"  To put it bluntly, I hated him.  I only looked as far as the character he played (which, now, says much about his acting ability) and found him weak, conniving, shrill, and patronizing.  Once he left the show, I never missed him.  Fast forward to 2009; I'd been unemployed for over a year and my ability to remain optimistic about life in general was rapidly disappearing.  I was unable to sleep at night because I was sleeping all day.  So, as such, I was flipping through the channels late one night and was stopped by a show featuring the \\"Spanish Word of the Day.\\"  I don't remember what the word was, I don't remember exactly what happened next.  All I know is that I kept watching long enough for a tall, lanky Scottish man to come on the screen and be censored by an Italian flag and a \\"Tutti Frutti!\\"<br /><br />It was love at first obscenity.<br /><br />From his poor beginnings in Cumbernauld to his great successes in Los Angeles, Craig Ferguson is the embodiment of the American Dream. It happens much as you would expect - poor kid wants more, poor kid works hard, poor kid falls down a lot, poor kid moves to America, poor kid falls down some more, poor kid eventually becomes rich kid.  There is little about Ferguson's story that people can't recognize in their own quests for self-fulfillment.  Yet, as he tells his tale, Ferguson is witty, humble, and honest in ways that I think most people aren't when relating similar stories.  He comes clean about his drug abuse and alcoholism; he owns it as a part of him.  There's no escaping it; it made him who he is today and he knows it.  He doesn't sugarcoat anything as he admits that his substance abuse played a large role in destroying both his first marriage and his relationship with his first true love.  A later chapter, simply titled \\"Rehab,\\" is one of the most poignant points of the book as he describes his literal struggle between choosing life or death.  Anyone who has ever dealt with addiction or any kind of mental illness can relate to this and I was truly in tears.  Keep in mind though that Ferguson's goal isn't to garner sympathy; as he says in the prologue, he tries to \\"spare [himself] no blushes.\\"  He is simply relating truth as he remembers it (or doesn't as the case may be). Most importantly, he wants you, American or not, to understand why he, a Scottish man, had to be American so badly.  And, if you're a natural-born American like myself, you're actually kind of proud to be one once he's done.  By the time I finished the book, Craig Ferguson had, in me, gained a life-long fan.<br /><br />This book is funny, it's tragic, it's beautifully written...a Scottish immigrant has written a quintessential American story.  It's a triumph in every word.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|this movie was fun to watch. All the old pros were funny. It arrived in a timely manner and in good condition. The price was right too.
B00D6SBOWG|4.0|I love this game I have it on all my devices.......Playing cards games r one of my favorites n this games is different
B00BUAEYVK|4.0|Bruce Willis is good in all the movies he makes. This one was especially good watching. It arrived in a timely manner and in good condition.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The characters are becoming people I know well...like family.  The plots are always mesmerizing.  What's next?!?!  In the beginning I had a hard time understanding the dialogue but I did get used to it after awhile.
B009NFHF0Q|1.0|This book was one of the most stupid I have ever read. What has out literarary world come to ?
B005HED11Y|5.0|If you liked it before you will love the re-mastered version. A beautiful job, brings out all the colors that were missing (like Kirk's green shirt is really green now).  Trekkies will love it, first timers will at least not be put off by the picture quality.
B002T9H2ME|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this movie! I got slightly obsessed with it after watching it the first time. If you're even only slightly into science fiction movie like I am, you'll still like this movie.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|There were entirely too many characters and too many stories going on at the same time to be a really good book.
B000GWE44U|5.0|This is one of the best classic horror movies, and I had to own it on Blu-ray after first watching it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|What more can I say?  Katniss is amazing, as it Peeta, and the story is woven quite well.  Quick read.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|After changing my router, I wanted an indication of the improvements obtained. analyzer gave a great visual presentation on my tablet that I could watch as I tried various nearby locations.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Again, another quick read.  Glad that Snow got what he deserved and same with the leader of District 13.  Will there be more?
B0051UP5NQ|2.0|In order to use this app, significant expense is required. I just use my desktop for those times. Having the app on my tablet is not useful for my needs.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A bit slow at the outset until you come to the selection of those for the games.  Quick read as are the other two.  Read all three in three weeks...Loved this book!
B0063M22QO|4.0|I've played different versions of Mahjong, but they were not set up like this version. This version sets up the tiles as a puzzle to solve; making you think about the selections needed to clear the board.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|If you like G then you will definitely dig this game. Excellent graphics/imagery, challenging battles along the journey. Actually some pretty good surprises along the way and the cool thing is you earn enough from your battles that you don't go whacked with impatience and feel compelled to buy gems every other moment. Glad I bought the game and pace myself on playing it so I can enjoy it longer.<br /><br />Peace<br />Master Jedi-Hawkeye
B00F56AZK4|2.0|Of the choices offered, only three were marked free. Those three had only 36 pieces in the puzzles I tried. Moving the pieces was not always easy, with several tries needed to actually get the piece chosen to move. The puzzles themselves had good artwork.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Incredibly disappointed in ending. I read these books over the summer and have been patiently waiting the arrival of this last book. I stayed up, read it all and now I'm left with a bitter taste in my mouth. While I understand the reality of the book, I expected to feel at peace with the series, has all I have is resentment towards the entire series. Tried and Four deserved a happy ending, since no on else had one.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been waiting for candy crush to come on the Kindle fire and it's finally here. I love it and it has not given me any problems so far.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is one of the best products I have a taste and now but the best games I like it tomorrow with like to have more games like these thank you
B00785P2QC|5.0|It was really great to find this game having previously been a big fan of SimCity. A bit slow rebuilding energy and other level.
B006O6F932|3.0|My daughter loves it, but a toy that won't last long. It's cheaply made and the configuration on it is hard for child to set up by themself.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Works far better than any other free task killer or app manager. Easy to use, and the graphics give a good overview.
B00EDLP6O2|1.0|Title says it all.  Looks like it downloaded but every time I try to install there is an error.  Was looking forward to playing it.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Awesome. Just play it once and you'll be hooked, and the best thing about deer hunter 2014 it's Free!!! I hope they keep updating!
034580404X|5.0|For me this is a love story and is about concessions in a relationship, flaws and qualities in each person. The sex part is just to have some ideas (if you haven't done some of them) to do more interesting your relationship in this area, in that case you always have to talk about it with your couple. For me was an addictive book. Definitively I loved CG, AS and all the characters!
B00000DRA9|3.0|There's one name to sum this all up: Giorgio Moroder. This man - while talented with vocal artists such as Howard Jones, Donna Summers, etc back in the 1980s - took to b@stardizing film scores which left a nasty taste in a lot of film  lovers' mouths. The Klaus Doldinger-driven score to The NeverEnding Story was the most notable, leaving American purists high and dry as the American version of the CD had little to do with the orchestral score than it did with amping it up with catchy tempo tracks. Limahl leads the way with the title song - which makes me think that the rest of the CD was meant to merely accompany the synth-heavy song with subtle-but-disrespectfully-short hints of Doldinger's original score. Another prime example of Moroder's synthy touch was the rare vinyl soundtrack to Superman III. Granted, not the best film, but the music composed and conducted by Ken Thorne (with touches of John Williams, of course) was massive and beautiful - particularly the opening title track (Streets of Metropolis) with its comically orchestral style. Superman score fans likely look down upon this release with great shame as (just prior to NeverEnding Story), Moroder crapped all over the soundtrack with radio tunes featured in the film, leaving very little room for Thorne's original work. To add insult to injury, Moroder was even given the chance to bookend the B-side of the record with a horribly synthesized version of the highly-recognizable Superman theme. That alone nearly made me throw out my copy of Superman III, but instead it sits on my shelf like a red-headed stepchild, next to its far superior vinyl pressings for Superman: The Movie and Superman II. The Superman III (not to mention IV: The Quest For Peace) score has never been released in its non-Moroder'ed entirety until Film Score Monthly took it upon themselves to release the ultimate limited edition box set of 8 discs containing the complete score for Superman 1 through 4 a couple of years ago at a then-hefty$200 asking price. Truthfully? TOTALLY WORTH IT.<br />As for The NeverEnding Story, to enjoy the complete original Klaus Doldinger-only score of this 1984 classic, go to iTunes or pick up the disc or vinyl (if you've still got that turntable!) for the appreciated German counterpart: Die Unendliche Geschichte.
B00BAXFDLM|5.0|And that's just it.  Very impressive.  There are many scenes that are now captured in my memory, waiting to be relived, reviewed, analyzed, and treasured.  There is also a complete lack of a negative in my mind.<br /><br />Although there are no real emotional jarring moments, there is a very real lingering attracvtion for the characters.<br /><br />The suspense was well done.  There have been many authors, in my reading experience, who use interludes and flash-backs as a device to add tension, causing the reader to long for a return to the main thread.  However, in this example, those techniques were used with skill, and actually added value to the overall experience.<br /><br />I eagerly await the next in the series!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Add more self help sounds... Stop smoking ... Stress relief. Ect. Anxiety like Holo sink thanks for this I use everyday.
B00395ZYVS|4.0|This novel was a look at a culture that is very different than our western one.  It lovingly revealed a world of sights and sounds that you could feel from the authors words. The characters were well written and brought to life for us. I would recommend it
B00BD99JMW|4.0|People read to escape their own reality and I think many expect a happily ever after in their alternate reality every time. It's nice to read books with a shockingly real twist. This was by far my favorite book in the series and I thought the ending was right on.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book opened up my eyes in how to effectively work at a relationship that brings so much fulfillment to both partners.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|So  awesome. I love this app. So amazing. Like vast app ever.  Buy this app. Buy It now. Do it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is a blast, I play it all the time. Don't think it's a rip off just because it's free, it's amazing, plus it always makes me laugh.  :)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My entire family loves this game. From my youngest five to thirty this is a fun time. The updates are great as well.
B005K17RU0|1.0|Hard to navigate, too much clutter! Since I did the update a few days ago I have not been able to see the radar! This is not acceptable! Accuweather used to be my favorite weather app, til now. Hate to see it go but I need the radar for outdoor activities such as hunting, fishing, and farming. Especially in calving season! I won't be graphic, lets just say radar is very important.Wish I could roll it back!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was truly something that changed my life. It's such a moving tale. This one made it to the top five list.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great follow up to the first book. I am in love with the story line. Keeps me on my toes!!! Can't wait to see how it ends!!!
B005H0CBZ0|5.0|I feel when I read these books that I am one of them.  I am traveling on their journey.  I recommend these books but you need to read from the beginning.  If you don't you will have missed a lot of the story.
B00F0N7JUG|5.0|I really liked the editing I think I could maybe sell at a more comfortable but the presentation is very nice to lavista very entertaining movie and a good movie
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book opens up infinite possibilities to embracing your inner being and allowing people to see the energy that you create with the thoughts you have.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|This book was absolutely terrific. I stayed up late every night reading chapter after chapter. Brandon Sanderson successfully creates a world full of uncertainty, where the roles of<br />Hero and villain are reversed. I am now anxiously awaiting Firefight!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Very fun game helps pass time. I love playing against my friends on Facebook. I Hope you make more games soon. Thanks.
B00ADQPA38|5.0|I purchased this copy to add to my collection. I intend on completing the series as they are made available.
B00BEIYMIS|4.0|Like other films that James Wan has directed \\"The Conjuring\\" generates thrills and chills mixing old fashioned horror film making without relying on extensive visual effects.<br /><br />SPOILERS:<br /><br />Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga deal with nasty hauntings. Carolyn and Roger Perron (Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston) live in such a house where manvelant spirits are threatening their family. Unfortunately the spirits have latched on to the family so no matter where they go, it'll follow them. Carolyn reaches out to Ed and Lorraine hoping that they can help drive the creatures from their home.<br /><br />A nice blend of the new and old \\"The Conjuring\\" touches on everything from \\"The Amnityville Horror\\" to \\"The Exorcist\\" with a touch of \\"The Birds\\" thrown in for good measure. Wan skillful merges these different elements and, with terrific performances from his cast, creates a refreshingly old fasioned scare fest that is a nice change of pace from the \\"found footage\\" flicks.<br /><br />I did feel that the film lost some of its momentum by the conclusion but, otherwise, it was a fun ride.<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS:<br /><br />The Blu-ray edition looks marvelous. This is the type of film that has long sequences in darkness. The blu-ray transfer has nice detail and the subdued color scheme is largely faithful to the theatrical showing of the film.<br /><br />The audio is immersive putting us into the house with the family.<br /><br />The special features seem a bit on the lite side to me but what we do get is pretty good. \\"The Conjuring: Face To Face With Terror\\" allows the family (and Lorraine Warren, Ed is deceased) portrayed in the film to share their experience.<br /><br />We also get a featurette \\"A Life In Demonology\\" focusing on the cases that the Warrens worked on. We also get a glimpse inside the New England Paranormal Museum. Other paranormal investigators also chime in with information about Ed and Lorraine Warren.<br /><br />The final special feature is an eight minute featurette entitled \\"Scaring The '@$*%' Out Of You\\". Producer Peter Sanfran, Veriga and Wan discuss the making of the film and what brought them to the project.<br /><br />The packaging also includes a DVD (with all the special features) and a code for a digital download.<br /><br />A entertaining horror movie with plenty of thrills, \\"The Conjuring\\" reminds us that you don't need buckets of blood, sex or outrageous violence to scare your audience. As someone points out in the \\"Scaring The '@$*%' Out Of You\\" Wan wanted to avoid \\"cheap scares\\" and use his skills as a film director (the writers point out that the original script had MORE scares but Wan elected to pull some of them out so that he could build suspense)to pull the audience in before pulling the rug out from under them.nal special feature is an eight minute featurette entitled \\"Scaring The '@$*%' Out Of You\\".

B00D2CYV9E|5.0|Saw the video at a friends house. I knew that I wanted it for my collection even before it was released to the public. The listed cast was great as always. Very tastefully made and presented. Appropriate viewing for adults and pre teens.
0812973992|3.0|The book seems overwritten to me, with a lot of extra details that are pretty, and \\"well-written\\" but don't add anything to the story. Do we need to know what is in someone's wastepaper basket if those items don't figure in anything? There's a lot of description here of what is happening, but very little in-depth. The description of the car crash, e.g., is very precise, but so what? It reveals nothing about any of the characters involved. The author seems to think that a fatal accident is enough by itself, that being a priest, or a hooker, is enough -- but that's lazy, imo. Although stereotypes can be brought alive, these are not  -- the conflicted priest, the intelligent hooker. Also, the structure is too clever by half. I have a feeling this author sat down and asked himself what would sell. Set the book in NYC, check. Use the World Trade Center at the height of its glory, check. Use a clever structure of vaguely intertwined stories, check. And it worked. The book became very popular. It's not a bad read, but it didn't live up to its hype, in my opinion.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I honestly don't understand all the bad reviews. Yes, we all would like the fairy tale ending; however, we don't always get what we want. I think Ms. Roth did an great job of giving an ending to an amazing series. Tris is a character that would do anything for her family and friends...I believe had she let her brother die it would have been a terrible ending! This is a series that I have and will continue to recommend to friends!

B00FPH6A70|4.0|When I was much younger, I am 50 now, I really liked scary movies. However, in the last 1-2 decades, they just did not have the same appeal to me anymore. I try to watch them but I end up turning them off and find them silly/poorly done/bad story/bad acting/etc. Very few scary movies seem capable of holding my attention now days. The reviews for this movie gave me the impression it might be better.<br /><br />Basic premise: The family moves into a house that has an evil spirit and starts terrorizing them. They ask two known paranormal experts to help them rid their family of the entity.<br /><br />This basic premise has been done over and over again. Did this movie do a good job? Yes they did.<br /><br />This movie is not overdone, underdone, it is just right in so many ways. The acting, the CGI and the writing are all well done. This movie kept my attention from beginning to end. In fact, it left me wanting to see more. A rarity these days. I would like for the same makers to make a movie about the doll.<br /><br />Family friendly: Only scary parts. No nudity, sex nor offensive language.<br /><br />If you are looking for blood and guts or tons of gore this is not your movie. The movie is not super scary. This is pretty good story telling with better than average acting and the special effects were perfect for the movie. It is like the people that made the movie really wanted to make a quality scary movie. It probably won't win any awards but compared to the competition, it is by far the best scary movie I have seen in a long time.<br /><br />4 stars for a movie is a very good rating from me. Friends/family know I watch a lot of movies and often ask me for recommendations.<br /><br />ETA: I have seen several reviewers mention/compare the movie \\"Insidious.\\" I decided to give it a watch tonight. First, I did not realize I had seen \\"Insidious\\" before until I got to the bed scene. I thought some stuff looked familiar. I rented this movie some time back and turned it off before it ended. I did the same tonight. \\"Insidious\\" is not even in the same league as \\"The Conjuring.\\" They both have one of the same lead actors but that is it.\\"before it ended.

B004478AS4|5.0|How could anyone flesh out a very foreign life-view with hardly a wasted syllable? This deservedly honored account of the tragic clash of cultures whose consequences persist and resound hugely is so beautiful and engaging, and hard to continue in view of the horrible outcomes only beginning by the end.
067101756X|3.0|I bought this as a gift for someone who is interested in this type of thing and haven't had any feedback.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie should be required viewing for all young men. A solid story about the break down of our society due to men not properly supporting their families.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I enjoyed getting to know an adult Dan Torrance after all these years.  Getting to see who he become in spite of his father.  Meeting Abba and hearing her story.  I will recommend this book to those who enjoyed the shinning.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Just hard enough. Only quibble is that a few times I was stumped only because I couldn't find something, it was hard to find on the screen. It was expected to be obvious I guess, I used all the clues but they didn't help. Found it eventually. Still, loved it and went back and did it again and it was almost as fun. I can't wait until a new chapter comes out. It is very detailed, screens are very well done. A great game.
B00A4TKDKY|3.0|Live performances are good but the total live recordings are short- consequently they have had to add a couple of studio recordings to fill in the gap. Would have been really good if it was all live.

B00BD99JMW|5.0|I CANT BELIEVE IT'S OVER!!!! Veronica Roth wrote an amazing and spellbinding tale. This one brought tears to my eyes. Everything that her characters go through...they feel like people that I know and have come to love. I'm so sad that the series is over...but this roller coaster ride that the Divergent series took me on was completely worth it.

1592332803|5.0|I have to say, this is an awesome book! The author's personal background, as well as the motivating factors behind the compilation of this recipe book, are both compelling and thoughtful. I was already aware of the atrocities that take place with today's commercialized factory farming, and the inhumane treatment inflicted upon \\"food\\" animals. But, it is always great to hear others who share your perspectives! The writing is done in a way that does not come across as \\"preachy,\\" but merely informative. Kudos to the author for the delicious and creative, yet easy to prepare recipes, beautiful photographs and helpful tips! This is an all-inclusive, informative book that will be well-used in my kitchen : )
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|the game is fun. but only having five lives sucks. it takes forever for them to regenerate l. so I give it 3stars
B001I0T92Q|5.0|Works perfect for 1 or 2 micro SD cards, and accommodates sony formats easily.  Price was just right and delivery was very reasonable and timely!!  Hope to get more of these in the future if I need Sony format support in SD cards.

B003G4W49C|5.0|I first read Ender's Game over 20 years ago.  I found the story fascinating and compelling. So much so, that I gifted copies of it to many friends.  Now, it's coming out as a movie in a few weeks so I decided to retread it.  I still found it incredible and heartbreaking in many ways.  I love Ender Wiggin and plan to read the others in the series again, too.  In these times of turmoil and hate, I wish that the Ender's philosophy could take root throughout the world.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoyed it but there needs to be more to it. The mis-direction makes it more challenging. Keep me posted. I'd like to see some more difficult or more steps to solving the seafch.
B00DV9QHB8|5.0|Lang Lang and Simon Rattle have worked together for years, so this new disc on Sony Classical comes after the two developed a fondness for each other.  Listening to Rattle's thoughts on working with Lang Lang, he seems almost in awe of his gifts and pleased to be working with him.  My fear was that Rattle would simply go along for the ride and succumb to fussiness, thereby dragging down the whole enterprise.<br /><br />But Rattle has shown affinity for both Prokofiev and Bartok in the past and thankfully in this case he is at the height of his game.  From the start of the Prokofiev 3rd Concerto we hear music-making that is truly mesmerizing.  Lang Lang plays with command boosted by his dazzling technique, delving into the work with a true sense of adventure.  He is a chameleon of the keyboard, finding many shades of color and elaborating with his combination of nuance and sheer charisma.  One might find his pianism less individual than past readings from Kissin and Argerich, who both mastered the work, but for dash and energy, Lang Lang probably surpasses them both.  The decisive factor in making this album a success may be Rattle, actually, who is sparkling and idiomatic, more so than Abbado with the same orchestra for both Kissin and Argerich.  He finds great variety all throughout the score but his naturalness caught me off guard--there's none of his afflicting self-consciousness.  The Berliners are beyond words and with the wonderful recorded sound, the experience could hardly be bettered.<br /><br />This Bartok 2nd comes on the heels of a great reading from Leif Ove Andsnes and Pierre Boulez with the same orchestra a few years back.  This reading is less precise and direct but the flexibility in the phrasing is truly remarkable.  Is it a bad thing that the scoring doesn't sound as percussive?  I don't think so, because we enter a whole new sound world that has plenty of energy, only it's less exhausting for the listener.  We've reached a point where musicians can afford to play challenging works like these without struggling to reach the end.  The danger is that we could lose some of the novelty in the process, but here are two modernists who skillfully make their way through the score, finding more meaning instead of less.  Rattle sees this music as having many facets of rich instrumental color, so once again the orchestral playing is simply gorgeous.  Lang Lang doesn't sweat his way through, playing instead with captivating control that is carefully guided and adept.  In all, I don't usually think of Bartok as having so much contrast; there's an almost whimsical feeling here that makes every bar fresh and often unexpected.<br /><br />I had apprehensions about the coupling of Lang Lang and Rattle, fearing they would feed off of one another's tendency towards fussiness.  Instead we have consummate musicianship that jumps to the top of the list for lovers of these concerti.an afford to play challenging works like these without struggling to reach the end.

0440217563|5.0|I dare anyone to start reading this series and be able to put it down for any amount of time. I am so in love with Jamie and Claire and long for there to actually be a love so true and attentive thorns and all in reality as theirs. Voyager brings them back together after 20 years apart and okay I admit it.. I had to flip to their first moment or reintroduction to satisfy my heart. No disappointment here.<br />Gabaldon is brilliant - simply brilliant !

B00622BF40|5.0|Though the movie is several years old, I absolutely love it.  Acting was great and loved all the drama in the family and the system of ballroom dancing.
1451695195|3.0|The book is pretty convincing at it's core but I stopped reading it due to the author's long winded lecturing about the workings of the human brain. It was too much \\"classroom\\" for me which was boring.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love it!! Needs to have more options to unlock levels instead of waiting on Facebook friends to send you a ticket. Other than that, keep up the good work!!!
B0034G4P8A|5.0|This is a great movie, very pricey, so I was happy to find it at a decent price, didn't matter that it was used
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|I can't see why you need to buy things on this app? If you don't watch what you're doing you could spend a good amount of money each month.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Well worth the wait.  The book ties all of them together and keeps you enthralled to the end. The last four chapters had me in tears.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I really enjoy this device.  It works really well with my Ipod touch and Iphone.  I also use it with my chromebook.  I have a DVD player that has youtube built in, but I like searching for youtube clips on my chromebook, it's just easier to type.  It's really easy to control the playback and I like sharing with the family and friends on the TV rather than everyone crowding around a small chrome book screen.  The price is right $35.  Love it.
0375869026|5.0|This is a well written story about the struggle and courage of being different. It is a page turners for both adults and children.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Starting this trilogy, I thought I'd experience a world similar to the Mockingbird trilogy.  Little did I suspect, I'd be suffering through another &#34;Mistborn&#34; series with an ending that I personally hated!  If I wanted a &#34;reality&#34; based ending, where there is no happily ever after, I'd be reading non fiction.  I find it difficult to follow or recommend a series where they kill off the characters the readers are drawn to from the VERY BEGINNING!<br /><br />Why waste my time getting involved with your main character if the author is simply going to write a SAD SAD and depressing ending?  Honestly, my life sucks enough, without wasting my time and money to read a story that is going to leave me more depressed.<br /><br />I like the idea, I liked the first two books, but this particular story fell short of perfection.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|sooooooo fun!!!!!!!!! right now I'm competing against my friend. can't stop playing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />you should so get it .their is nothing bad about this game
B00AE4OGCU|5.0|Hooked from start to finish. Can be hard to follow with all the characters in it, but we'll worth the read.

B00ERIUO02|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised with this album and all its' beauty. The album cover and the rest of the album art catch the eye and compliments the overall soul and beauty of the songs.  Prism shows a different side of Katy with more mature and meaningful lyrics that bring out Katy's talent. There's not one song on the album that I don't like as most of the tracks are very strong and can definitely hold their own. The only 2 songs that didn't stand out as much to me were \\"Love Me\\" and \\"This Moment.\\" They're still really nice pretty songs but they're not as strong as the rest of the tracks.<br /><br />I listened to the entire album as I was driving home from work and it just had a very peaceful and relaxing vibe that made the drive home much more pleasant. I loved all of the songs but This is how we do, Unconditionally, Double Rainbow, and Spiritual were amongst my favorites. Unconditionally, Double Rainbow, and Spiritual have very heart felt and hauntingly beautiful lyrics whereas This is How We Do is more fun and upbeat and sounds more like Katy's other pop hits such as TGIF.<br /><br /> I also really liked her song Legendary Lovers. I felt the beats and style of the chorus were unique and not like a typical Katy Perry song. It actually sounds more like a song Shakira would do. Songs like Roar, Birthday, Walking on Air, and International Smile are the dancy, upbeat, fun songs. Birthday and Walking on air kind of have an 80s sound to it which I like.<br /><br />Another one of my favorite tracks, Dark Horse, is more hip hop with amazing beats and chorus. The rest of the songs are more heart felt, slower ballad type songs. Ghost sounds like a personal song written about the break up/divorce that she just went through. It's one of the more sad songs that add a personal touch to the album.<br /><br />None of the songs disappoint and will leave you with most of them stuck in your head. It is definitely an album one should sit with and really listen to as opposed to just skipping through the tracks. The first half of the album is more upbeat and poppy while the second half winds down to the beautiful more mellow songs.<br /><br />This album has a song for everyone and it seems like Katy definitely worked really hard on it and put a lot of heart and soul into the songs. I really love the personal touch to this album but that she also did some songs that reflect her fun quirky side. Overall beautiful and well done.ping through the tracks.

B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|I finally got the missing Jesse Sone to complete my set! It arrived quickly and in great shape and plays well, too! Thanks!
B001MSMULG|5.0|I love the way Daniel Silva writes. He has obviously done his research into the history and attitudes that prevail in Israel and the Palestinian lands. His spy novels are both page turners and good literature.
B007V65R54|5.0|Great book for anyone, but in particular for those that don't have a statistical background.  Well written, easy to understand.  Would recommend this book as a way to change the way people evaluate data.
006202406X|5.0|My reposted review of the book:<br />I finished the book around noon yesterday and I had avoided spoilers. Its been about 24 hours since I've read the book, and I'm glad I've spent some time to reflect on it and try to figure out how I feel. At first, I loved the book until the very end. But then I went from being completely devastated and angry at Veronica Roth to now understanding that this was the best ending of the series...and it may even be the best conclusion to any series or book I've ever read. For me, this series is right up there with Harry Potter, I love it that much.<br /><br />There were flaws, like how easily Evelyn gave into Tobias, and then all the revolutions and counterrevolutions were a little difficult to keep up with, but the overall commentary on human nature is what will makes this series a classic in my mind.<br /><br />Some of the things I loved:<br /><br />- The Tris and Tobias POV...I understood Tobias even more, and it made their scenes together even more sweet. And when Tobias makes that one big mistake, I have his POV so I can understand where he is coming from.<br /><br />-Tris and Tobias in general. This has the be the most realistic relationship I've ever read, and not just in young adult fiction. You get to see the insecurities they both have and how much they mean to one another. Roth gives the best definition of love-that it is knowing your flaws and the flaws of the other person but still CHOOSING to be with that person. Out of all the books, Allegiant had the best part of their relationship. Its especially bittersweet that towards the end, when they are the most confident in their relationship and have pretty much sealed the deal, that they are unable to experience life together away from the chaos. That part made me the saddest.<br /><br />Things I was sad that happened, but understand and accept them:<br /><br />-Tris sacrificing herself for Caleb. At first I was angry at Veronica since I thought that she only made this plottwist to be controversial or different. But then I realized that I had known this would happen the second everyone decided Caleb would be the one to die. Knowing Tris and her values, I knew right away that she would not let Caleb die...no matter how much he might have deserved it. Her subsequent realization of what actual sacrifice means meant that it would be going against the integrity of her character for her not to take action. I actually believe that it was important for her to die, and that she didn't die for nothing. I don't think Caleb would have been able to do what they were supposed to do, only Tris could have. Caleb is a coward, Tris isn't. And she has integrity and principles which would have prevented her from doing anything other than sacrificing herself the way her mother had. Its ironic that despite all the serums that can't control her, in the end it was just a bullet that killed her. Almost proof that she was just a human after all.<br /><br />-Tobias grieving for Tris. That memory serum scene with Christina crushed me. And then the scattering the ashes over the zip line was unbearably sad and beautiful.<br /><br />And that's how I would describe Allegiant, sad and beautiful.<br /><br />It's realistic and unfair, but incredibly deep.<br /><br />It's a masterpiece.
006202406X|1.0|I have literally never felt so betrayed by a book in my entire life. I've been dying to read this book and after finishing, I wish I never did. I get that life is tough but to end a series the way she did is not something that I want when I'm looking to get away from my own life for a little bit. I feel like I emotionally invested the time and energy caring about the series and it was all for nothing. I'm so disappointed in Roth's choices for this book. You're better off stopping after Insurgent and imagining your own conclusion to this at-first great series.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I couldn't figure out what the plan was until it was revealed. ONE OF Grisham's best stories. I highly recommend.

B001QB9ETK|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies, with a great cast of characters.  The soundtrack is AMAZING.  You will have to pay attention to the movie to keep up with exactly what is going on.  Or, watch it twice and see what you missed.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|This is a fun game to play but I have found that it sticks, ALOT.  This can be very frustrating when trying to win a new level.  I must say that my kids enjoy playing.  They play it more than I do.

B0000029AP|5.0|This is one of their best albums ever, when I have heard only a few songs on the radio, I say to myself I wish I had the whole album/CD so I may listen any time I get in the mood. Now Amazon offers us the opportunity to do just that. Love it!!!

B004SOR4H6|4.0|I don't tweet much anymore,  but you have to have twitter, or else people will be like &#34;wait, you're not on twitter? Did you miss 2008 or something? So, yeah, it's a good app.
B0098QBEXO|5.0|Like most people I've spoken with, I was lured into the Cumberbatch craze when a friend introduced me to Sherlock. Since then, I've gone on a spree, watching his movies and listening to his radio programs. . .<br /><br />Out of all of them, I was most impressed with Third Star. I was brought to tears several times through the course of the movie, and there is something very real and poignant about this picture, most especially the ending, which I won't spoil. This movie operates on several levels, both stimulating our emotions and delving into the deeper questions of love, friendship, life and death.<br /><br />Beautiful. I think out of everything I've seen, I'd consider this one of Benedict's masterpeices. Definitely worth watching, and owning.
006202406X|2.0|Oh, Ms. Roth!  Why?!  WHYYYYYYYYY!!????!!!<br /><br />Seriously.<br />I loved Divergent.  And I liked Insurgent (though slightly less, as it suffered from that part-two-of-a-trilogy-kinda-pointless syndrome).  Despite that, I was excitedly looking forward to Allegiant.  I was ready to savor the relationship between Tris & Tobias, ready to get to the bottom of this mystery.<br /><br />I have to admit, I was was not a big fan of the dual-perspectives.  I've read a couple of the e-books from Tobias's perspective (Free Four and The Transfer) and they were just okay.  Most of Allegiant feels flat, missing the voice that drew us in with Divergent.  TRIS was that draw, that voice, the character that we saw evolving and growing (though admittedly making some stupid choices in book 2).  TRIS'S PERCEPTIONS OF TOBIAS were the draw -- feeling the attraction from her POV.  And I cannot believe that Roth went the ending route that she did.  It was just heartbreaking.  HEARTBREAKING.  I cried like a baby ... and it wasn't the such-a-good-book!-everyone-enjoys-a-good-cry type of cry.<br /><br />Oh no.  It was a big nasty cry.  And every time I thought of the ending, for hours after finishing the novel, my face would crumple and I'd be sniffling all over again.  Such a disappointment.<br /><br />I usually enjoy reading and rereading my favorite novels/series.  But I don't know that I can go back and reread Divergent & Insurgent now.  I kind of feel like it's been ruined for me.  Darn it, where's my tissues.  Stupid book.<br /><br />ETA:  Okay, now that I've stopped weeping every time I think of the book, I am raising my rating by one star.  I am still disappointed in the ending ... I wanted MORE from this book.  More explanation of the world they are in, more good moments between Tris & Tobias, more closure for some of the other events/characters.  The last third of the book feels a bit rushed; I wish we could've drawn it out, fleshed things out a bit more, given Tris some better final moments.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved it, couldnt put it down, read all 3 books on my Kindle, was so happy to get them, now waiting for 2nd movie and there better be a third.

B00F8H0LM2|4.0|enjoy the game all of Rovio apps seem to be the best as far as play on the Kindle ics concerned
B00BD99JMW|4.0|When I bought the Kindle version of the book, I couldn't help but see some of the negative reviews. I was worried, but decided to make up my own mind. As I read, I thought oh no, the reviewers were right, this book is terrible. The first half felt unfinished and unnecessary. Luckily the pace and the plot picked up in the second half and the story ended decently. I thought it was a fitting end to the series.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is a really fun game. The 15x15 is challenging,  but doable. I wish there were more puzzles, but otherwise it is great!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|OMG great book!!! Way better than the movie. I watched the movie first then read and loved it. Couldnt of asked for a better more detailed book.

B00AZMFJYA|4.0|This was a little Star Trek overlay over the political world view of creating terrorist in our own world.  This fits with the modern view that the Western countries are to blame for the terrorists in the world. .
B001KWZ796|5.0|From the very first time I saw this movie, it was immediately a favorite that I watch over and over.  Angelica Houston does not dissapoint in her role as the evil stepmother.  Drew Barrymore is as beautiful as ever.  Doug Ray Scott...so handsome!!  I love all the wardrobe and scenery.  The story of course is an all-time classic  I will definitely keep watching over and over.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another great book would recommend highly, really great ending. This book keeps you interested until your finished you can not put  it down until your finished.
B00FJTWK0U|4.0|I was truly ecstatic to hear there was a 3rd movie about Jessie and Celine.  Perhaps there should be a movie made about all the in-between years.  The movie made me angry, sad, and happy all at the same time.  I was happy that they were together although sad that Jessie could not be with his son.  I was angry and sad that Celine felt she didn't love Jessie anymore but I am hopeful that they will find that love again that they did so many years before.  I am sad that the movie ended but am hopeful that there will be another movie.  Hoping we don't have to wait 10 years for the next movie though!!!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Sometimes a book has such a good story that the writing itself can be mediocre and it doesn't really matter. Other times, the writing is so amazing that the story can be lacking and it's still a great read. Unfortunately, this book is neither of these. The writing is awkward and reads like a CliffNote's version of a book. The plot is unbelievable, even within the context of the book, and the characters are lackluster. I was halfway through a chapter written from Tobias's point of view before I even realized it was Tobias speaking, not Tris. I would still recommend the first two books, as they fell into the \\"okay writing / great story and characters\\" category. This book, however, I would only recommend as a model of what not to do in the third book of a trilogy.
B00EKQ3YZI|1.0|I just received the new love to love remix of donna summer and I am appalled at what you did with this ladys music. I wish I hadn't bought this piece of crap. you wrecked all the songs and they do not even sound like donna summer. her estate should sue your rear end for this I would be behind them 100%.
B00CWGLOY6|5.0|Love the plot and intertwining technologies<br />Art work is beautiful and lively.<br />Can't wait for the next volume.<br /><br />This is a mature graphical novel like Y the last man.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Really! And I can't get any levels past level 35 unless I pay for it! WoW, what a rape! This company is pulling in over $650,000 a day, really makes me wonder about you people! No patience to wait for new lives...really stupid.  With that much money coming in, why can't we access as many levels as we want without paying for them?? Too bad the creators of 'Bejeweled&#34; didn't charge us for getting past level &#34;35&#34;, they'd be rich rapists too.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Great book. Must read. Loved the end!<br /><br />Why do they ask me to give an opinion then require a certain number of words??????
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|Perfect pace for beginners. You can do lessons over and over until you are comfortable going to the next. I love how you can also check ur pronunciation. They need to make more versions for other languages. This app makes me feel like i could possibly learn them all with enough time. Very excited.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I never reviewed a book but I have to say something about this book. First off I like to say that I love Divergent & Insurgent and been waiting for Allegiant for over a year. Man what a waste!  And can't understand how some people could give this 5 stars! But I did notice that the 5 star reviewers did state that reality is cruel that's why they loved it b/c it was so realistic or some crap like that. But this isn't reality people it's fiction! If I wanted to feel cheated and disappointed I would turn on the news.... I read books to pull me out of my reality where unbelievable happy endings do occur. I mean really with all the crazy simulations talked about throughout the series Roth couldn't use them to alter reality or something in order to change the ending! I also feel like this book had a lot of story lines that went untold. Along with that Roth changed the format....I feel like when an author does this it's because they don't have direction or a strong storyline to follow. So the going back and forth between Tris and Tobias didn't work for me......she should of stuck with just Tris's perspective. Either she needs to write a 4th book and redeem herself or this is a perfect example where Hollywood needs to change it for film or else the movies won't make it.
0345529057|5.0|One of the best books series ever; great stories, great characters and delicious food and drinks. I really love it.
B008Y212PI|5.0|it was fun fun fun playing this game.<br />I got this is a free app of the day and it was fun to play
B00DW5IKJI|5.0|First off, why was this thing pulled??  There is nothing wrong with it, as far as remastered sound and tracklisting, and the essay is well-written.  If I have one complaint, it's that they could have fit even more music...54 minutes on CD1 and 62 minutes on CD2...8 to 10 more tracks could have been added...but based on her discography and is actually here, this is the most up-to-date and complete collection of Britney singles/hits released thus far.  32 of 38 singles??  Not bad really!!  And it serves a purpose...with \\"3\\" here, you don't need that \\"Singles Collection\\" CD, and the 1 song missing from \\"My Prerogrative\\", \\"I've Just Begun (Having My Fun)\\"...you can get a single or an import \\"In The Zone\\", so you don't need that one either...or even \\"Playlist\\" or other collections.  It also has \\"Scream & Shout\\" from will.i.am's mixed-bag album, so you don't have to buy that to get the Brit collab...so this \\"Essential\\" serves a MAJOR role!!  Was this pulled because of Interscope objections over \\"Scream & Shout\\"??<br /><br />Anyhoo, hearing this (almost) 2-hour extravaganza of Britney from 1998 to 2013, it's a revelation, how she evolved from Bubblegum Radio Disney starlet a la Annette Funicello to trendy club banger, while still retaining her sticky sweet, catchy-as-heck bubblegum center and artistic aspirations...this is what happens when label peeps leave their artists alone and don't control their careers...trust even...when the artist knows what she is doing, you have a career like Brit's, which could have easily dried up after the \\"Oops\\" album...but she made some smart turns and evolved in cool ways...and everything works...<br /><br />Let us now value what IS included and what's missing:<br /><br />Included:<br />CD1<br />1-- \\"...Baby One More Time\\" (#1 US and tops worldwide)<br />2-- \\"Sometimes\\" (#21 US and Top 10 worldwide)<br />3-- \\"(You Drive Me) Crazy\\" (The Stop! Remix) (#10 US & Top 10 worldwide, except #12 Australia)<br />4-- \\"From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart\\" (#14 US & Top 40 in Australia, Canada & New Zealand...not a single elsewhere)<br />5-- \\"Ooops!! I Did It Again\\" (#9 US & #1 everywhere else but #4 France & #2 Germany & Ireland)<br />6-- \\"Lucky\\" (#23 US but Top 10 & #1 everywhere else, except #16 in France)<br />7-- \\"Stronger\\" (#11 US & Top 10 or 20 worldwide)<br />8-- \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\" (#27 US but Top 10 worldwide & #13 in New Zealand)<br />9-- \\"I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman\\" (A Dido co-write that just missed the US Hot 100 by 2 spots but a huge hit worldwide)<br />10- \\"Overprotected\\" (The Darkchild Remix) (#86 US but huge worldwide)<br />11- \\"Boys\\" (The Co-Ed Remix feat. Pharell Williams) (the single from \\"Austin Powers Goldmember\\" that hit #122 US but huge worldwide)<br />12- \\"Me Against The Music\\" (w/ Madonna) (#35 US but much bigger worldwide, even hitting #1 in Australia & Ireland)<br />13- \\"Toxic\\" (#9 US and even bigger worldwide, #1 in 4 countries)<br />14- \\"Everytime\\" (the lovely Brit co-write that hit #15 US but Top 10 everywhere else, including #1 in 3 countries)<br />15- \\"Outrageous\\" (only hit #79 US, and nowhere else)<br /><br />CD2<br />1-- \\"My Prerogative\\" (her Bobby Brown cover that hit #101 US but huge elsewhere, including #1 in Ireland)<br />2-- \\"Do Somethin'\\" (#100 US but huge everywhere else but France)<br />3-- \\"Gimme More\\" (#3 US and huge worldwide)<br />4-- \\"Piece Of Me\\" (#18 US and huge worldwide)<br />5-- \\"Radar\\" (#88 US and charted worldwide too, not huge but notably #8 in Sweden)<br />6-- \\"Break The Ice\\" (#43 US and charted worldwide, even #9 in Canada)<br />7-- \\"Hot As Ice\\" (not a single but a notable track off \\"Blackout\\")<br />8-- \\"Womanizer\\" (#1 US and huge worldwide, #1 in 3 other countries)<br />9-- \\"Circus\\" (#3 US and huge worldwide)<br />10- \\"If U Seek Amy\\" (#19 US and pretty big worldwide)<br />11- \\"Out From Under\\" (#119 US & #32 in Sweden, popular as an album track)<br />12- \\"3\\" (#1 US & Canada, and huge worldwide)<br />13- \\"Hold It Against Me\\" (#1 US, Canada & New Zealand,huge everywhere else)<br />14- \\"Till The World Ends\\" (#3 US, and huge worldwide, Top 10 in most countries)<br />15- \\"I Wanna Go\\" (#7 US and pretty big worldwide, Top 5 also in Canada & France)<br />16- \\"Criminal\\" (#55 US but a Top 40 hit in 4 countries...Top 20 in 2)<br />17- \\"Scream & Shout\\" (w/ Will.I.Am) (#3 US but #1 just about everywhere else in the world...we are one of only 3 countries it missed #1...the others: Australia & Sweden (both #2)<br /><br />Pretty strong tally...sooo what's missing??  Here goes:<br />1-- \\"Ooh La La\\" (should have been on here because it will likely NOT be on \\"Britney Jean\\", and it's only on the \\"Smurfs 2\\" soundtrack & would have fit here, it was a single and hit #54 US and charted elsewhere and missed the Top 40 everywhere...but it is a cute song)<br />2-- \\"SMS\\" (w/ Miley Cyrus)...it's on her \\"Bangerz\\" disc, and would have fit here on \\"Essential\\" as well.<br />3-- \\"I Love Rock & Roll\\" (her cover of my friend Alan Merrill & Jake Hooker's 70s glam band the Arrows from NYC from 1976 but hit big in the UK...it was huge as a Joan Jett cover in 1982...Brit modeled her cover on the Arrows 1976 original & missed the US chart entirely but was a sizable hit in a few countries, including Top 10 in Germany & Ireland)<br />4-- \\"I've Just Begun (Having My Fun)\\" (an \\"In The Zone\\" outtake that made her first hits collection and was a single but flopped everywhere...should have been here though)<br />5-- \\"Born To Make You Happy\\" (a HUGE worldwide single off her debut album that never had a US single release...if it did, instead of the not-as-good \\"From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart\\", she would have had 3 Top 10 singles off 1 album then, instead of having to wait for \\"Femme Fatale\\" to achieve that in the US, guaranteed...that song hit #1 in the UK & Ireland, and Top 3 in Sweden, Switzerland & Germany, and #9 in France...\\"Bottom\\" missed the Top 10 in the US and everywhere else...was that a wrong decision on Jive's part or what??  It DEFINITELY should have been here too, as this Essential should represent all WORLDWIDE hits through 2012 & 1st half of 2013, not just the US!!)<br />6-- \\"Soda Pop\\" (no, not a single, but should have been, and it was featured on the soundtrack to \\"Sabrina The Teenage Witch\\" on Geffen, it was many people's first introduction to Britney...it was mine...and it got serious airplay on Radio Disney in 1998 and made their charts, so it definitely should have been here...it's a cute bubblegum/faux-reggae song)<br />7-- \\"Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know\\" (bombed in the US, only hitting #112, but was a sizable hit worldwide, even hitting #12 in 4 countries)<br />8-- \\"Someday (I Will Understand)\\" (a VERY rare single, not even on an album, but an import single and the rare EP \\"Britney & Kevin: Chaotic\\", it only charted in 3 countries, but high: #8 in Sweden, #10 in Switzerland & #22 in Germany, and should have been included on \\"Essential\\" for that reason, and the rarity of it, both, plus Brit counts it as one of her fave songs she has written/co-written)<br />9-- \\"And Then We Kiss\\" (a bomb single, BUT should have been included for the rarity of it because only a remix of it was released on \\"B In The Mix Volume 2\\"...the original should have been here...<br />10- \\"Anticipating\\" (only charted #38 in France, but should be here for completion's sake)<br />11- \\"What's Going On??\\" (this charity single should have been here as well, because it was a charting record, hitting #27 US, and people may have forgotten about it)<br />12- \\"S&M\\" (Remix of Rihanna & Britney)...(as someone said, if they included \\"Scream & Shout\\" with Will.I.Am, they could have gotten this as well, plus it hit #1 US...it was HUGE and #1 or Top 3 everywhere in the world)<br />13- \\"Everybody\\" (this track from \\"Blackout\\" hit #81 in Canada, so they could have put that here too...if they had \\"Hot As Ice\\" from the same album, and it didn't even chart, why not this??)<br />14- \\"Kill The Lights\\" (this track from \\"Circus\\" hit #111 US, and should have been included to fill this thing up)<br />15- \\"Shattered Glass\\" (this track from \\"Circus\\" was a minor hit in 3 countries, including the US where it hit #70, as well as Canada (#75) & the UK (#192)...so it could have been included too)<br />16- \\"Up'N'Down\\" (this track from \\"Femme Fatale\\" charted at #110 US, so they could have squeezed it here as well)<br />17- \\"Like A Virgin/Hollywood\\" (Remix of Madonna & Britney, from Madge's \\"Remixed & Revisited\\" project spawned from her bomb \\"American Life\\" CD...hey, they had \\"Me Against The Music\\" & Will.I.Am, why not this as well??)<br />18- \\"Crazy\\" (w/ ex-husband Kevin Federline) (...hey, why not??  LOL!!  She is on the track, it's part of her history, that marriage, and they could have included it as a joke...if there was room, squeeze it on!!)<br />19- \\"I Can't Get No Satisfaction\\" (her Rolling Stones cover, just as a notable recording, even if it bombed or people forgot about it)<br /><br />So let's measure the two up...what was included was great and correct, remastered too...of the 19 missing, 10 could have been included, and the final 9 on an \\"Essential 3.0\\"...right now, being this was mysteriously pulled, best to make a 3rd CD with these cuts ourselves...then we'd have a \\"Britney Part 1\\" collection to be reckoned with, so there's yer guide...<br /><br />Overall, worth the 5 stars, AND a collector's item!!<br /><br />Lastly, bubblgum as artistic statement??  You betcha...many of these cuts were covered by many powerpop, alt-rock, underground, cult-fave, country, and torch singers, artists and bands seriously and tongue-in-cheek, even on the show \\"Glee\\" as theatrical ballad, some even as spoken-word, and it all works...plus Brit made her mark on pop culture...many have written her off as a joke...me included...but like a leech or a phoenix (you decide), Britney has both come back from the dead AND never went away...and she is bigger NOW than she was when she debuted with that juggernaut \\"...Baby One More Time\\"...and guaranteed, if people feel the need to dissect and analyze one or more of your singles, you KNOW you made your mark and an impact, not far off from Weird Al parodying a song of yours...<br /><br />Simply put, Britney is here to stay, like it or not...accept or suck it up, snobs...have been here too, as this Essential should represent all WORLDWIDE hits through 2012 & 1st half of 2013, not just the US!!)<br />6-- \\"Soda Pop\\" (no, not a single, but should have been, and it was featured on the soundtrack to \\"Sabrina The Teenage Witch\\" on Geffen, it was many people's first introduction to Britney...it was mine...and it got serious airplay on Radio Disney in 1998 and made their charts, so it definitely should have been here...it's a cute bubblegum/faux-reggae song)<br />7-- \\"Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know\\" (bombed in the US, only hitting #112, but was a sizable hit worldwide, even hitting #12 in 4 countries)<br />8-- \\"Someday (I Will Understand)\\" (a VERY rare single, not even on an album, but an import single and the rare EP \\"Britney & Kevin: Chaotic\\", it only charted in 3 countries, but high: #8 in Sweden, #10 in Switzerland & #22 in Germany, and should have been included on \\"Essential\\" for that reason, and the rarity of it, both, plus Brit counts it as one of her fave songs she has written/co-written)<br />9-- \\"And Then We Kiss\\" (a bomb single, BUT should have been included for the rarity of it because only a remix of it was released on \\"B In The Mix Volume 2\\"...the original should have been here...<br />10- \\"Anticipating\\" (only charted #38 in France, but should be here for completion's sake)<br />11- \\"What's Going On??\\" (this charity single should have been here as well, because it was a charting record, hitting #27 US, and people may have forgotten about it)<br />12- \\"S&M\\" (Remix of Rihanna & Britney)...(as someone said, if they included \\"Scream & Shout\\" with Will.I.Am, they could have gotten this as well, plus it hit #1 US...it was HUGE and #1 or Top 3 everywhere in the world)<br />13- \\"Everybody\\" (this track from \\"Blackout\\" hit #81 in Canada, so they could have put that here too...if they had \\"Hot As Ice\\" from the same album, and it didn't even chart, why not this??)<br />14- \\"Kill The Lights\\" (this track from \\"Circus\\" hit #111 US, and should have been included to fill this thing up)<br />15- \\"Shattered Glass\\" (this track from \\"Circus\\" was a minor hit in 3 countries, including the US where it hit #70, as well as Canada (#75) & the UK (#192)...so it could have been included too)<br />16- \\"Up'N'Down\\" (this track from \\"Femme Fatale\\" charted at #110 US, so they could have squeezed it here as well)<br />17- \\"Like A Virgin/Hollywood\\" (Remix of Madonna & Britney, from Madge's \\"Remixed & Revisited\\" project spawned from her bomb \\"American Life\\" CD...hey, they had \\"Me Against The Music\\" & Will.I.Am, why not this as well??)<br />18- \\"Crazy\\" (w/ ex-husband Kevin Federline) (...hey, why not??

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Some games are very difficult and I feel if a game is free why all the charges to move on, that makes the game not free and not good in the current economic climate especially for those with fixed incomes.
B000HZCZYW|5.0|Enjoyed it so much!The story and the comraderie of the crew was so wonderful to see again.LiveLong and Prosper!Love Spock!
B0091REZMW|4.0|The game is fun I wish the energy would load faster but then I would play all day!<br />It seems to go on forever
0440241588|5.0|A good read; John Grisham did his usual good writing and I did my usual enjoyable reading.  the plot was intriguing as usual.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Started out good,then turned into a terrible downward spiral towards the end. I can't fathom why the author chose to end the trilogy in such a way. If I could do it again I would not read this book and make up my own ending, just about anything would have been better. I do not recommend wasting time or money on this book.
B008YU0AOE|1.0|Downloaded and could only see top three numbers on android screen. Would not recommend. The app that came with the phone is better than this.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Best game online.  I tried any games but none compare to candy crush. Fast pace and.ne v er the same.  It constantly changes.
B00DMKFN34|1.0|My husband and I took our four children to see this movie (ages 9, 7, 5, & 4). Our youngest two are extra bright since they have older siblings, however, they couldn't have been less interested. The older two said it was good, but when I asked them if they wanted to see it again they said &#34;no.&#34; It would be good for a child who is specifically interested in airplanes, but even at that, the plot wasn't solid and the conclusion didn't even really make logical sense. I probably had my standards set too high because I have loved a lot of the recent Disney movies, but out of the eight people who went to see this movie together, only one said they would see it again.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|So happy this game is on my Kindle! Have been waiting along time for it to come. So glad it finally came!
B005GY0Y8S|1.0|This is one of the most poorly written books I have ever read. There were serious continuity issues, for example within 2 or 3 pages the victim had been dead 5, 3 or 6 months. The basic concept was pretty good, but a good editor or even someone to proofread would have caught these glaring errors. To me, this book is an argument against self-published works.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I not only spent my money on this trilogy, I spent time telling everyone I knew to read these books. What an utter disappointment! I am well aware that not all things have a happy ending....but I honestly feel this ending was not only pointless but a snub to loyal readers. With so much detail in the first two books, the third was poorly written. She gives us a little history and then just skips over many things...I really think the author didn't know how to make it all come together...so let's kill the main character! I will NOT be going to see the movies that I was so looking forward to, nor will I recommend these books to anyone again.
B008B68J2G|5.0|My daughter adores this set for her monster high dolls. Best money spent for a toy. She uses it all the time.
B00DW1WR14|3.0|Reminds me of the Avocado album - solid effort with some energized playing early on and a few experimental pieces; although unlike any past album this one has the most conventional rock ballad they're ever done (Sirens).<br /><br />Unfortunately the album is missing some of the great bridge melodies that made Backspacer such a gem. But what it misses the most is the storytelling that made the band a standout from the beginning. The best classic Pearl Jam songs work not only because the music's great but because we connect emotionally to the story; usually of pain & darkness eventually turning into hope & redemption.<br /><br />A Pearl Jam album without this storytelling rates no higher than 3 stars in my book - it has to have at least one classic story-song (e.g., Alive, Jeremy, Black, Daughter, Rearviewmirror, Elderly Woman..., Nothingman, Betterman, Off He Goes, Given To Fly, In Hiding, Amongst the Waves, etc...) to get 4 stars and more than one for a 5 star rating.
B000UZPIAW|3.0|i think the book is interesting, especially in the beginning - it's shocking to learn just how much abuse a human body can endure.  I did, however got a little bored with it.  Enough is enough!
1454704225|4.0|Craft-a-Doodle: 75 Creative Exercises From 18 Artists by Jenny Doh is a book that gives ideas and instruction on how to enhance some of those aimless scribbles that we all tend to do while theoretically occupied elsewhere. The charming illustrations give hints about how to draw quirky figures and combine them into portraits, decorations for edging papers or art to be framed. There are step by step instructions that are easy to follow and a great variety of exercises to stimulate one’s creative ideas.<br /><br />It’s always great to find a book that encourages one to have fun and this one certainly makes a person want to grab a blank sheet of paper and have a great time. I have always been a doodler but have had a fairly limited of primitive images that I tend to use and this book encouraged me to get beyond the ‘seagulls at a distance’ scribblings. I was amazed to discover what difference little lines can make when one knows where to put them. It’s just fun to play with making different types of eyes and then learn how to add little details to make different expressions. The other contributions that encourage one to combine drawings into larger pictures or make borders prompt one to create fanciful drawings without looking for perfection. A great book for stimulating creativity.<br /><br />© Night Owl Reviews<br /><br />I received a copy of this title in return for an honest review.
B003INBNXO|5.0|This movie was awesome. Donnie Yen was excellent in Ip Man. If you like martial arts movies, you'll like this movie.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have played this game on king.com a lot. It is a fun, addictive game to play - especially if you need to get your mind off of a current problem.  I'm glad there's an app to play this game on my Kindle Fire HD.
B004I1AGTC|5.0|Love this movie. Donnie Yen was excellent in Ip Man 2. If you love martial arts movies, you'll love this one.
147674355X|3.0|3.25 stars<br /><br />Even a few days after reading this, I'm still torn about this book. On the one hand, it had elements I love to have in a story - range in emotion, complex characters and a great concept behind the story. But on the other hand, it had some of the things that I can't stand in a story - lots of going-nowhere-ramblings, a heroine that gives me whiplash and a plot that wraps up too nicely after so much turmoil.<br /><br />So you see. Torn!<br /><br />I loved Holder. He was caring and thoughtful, funny and charming. Most of all, he was a rock for Sky and when his turn came to break down, he didn't hold back either.<br /><br />“I need to kiss you,&#34; he says again, this time a desperate plea. &#34;Please, Sky. I'm scared that after I tell you what I'm about to tell you...I'll never get to kiss you again.”<br /><br />Sky was a great character too. Yes, she kind of gave me whiplash with the way she kept going back and forth about Holder, but her strength and maturity was on a level I was not expecting. She took everything that was handed to her and dealt with it the best she could and when it became too much, she didn't give up. I admired her for that.<br /><br />“Its real, Six. You can't get mad at a real ending. Some of them are ugly. Its the fake happily ever afters that should piss you off.”<br /><br />Colleen Hoover's writing was engaging and the storyline was captivating enough that it kept me interested even when I came upon the things I disliked about the story. Her use of emotions was spot-on. Some appeared to be a bit much, but then again, teenagers tend to 'feel' things deeper than most.<br /><br />“I want to tell you exactly how I feel but there isn't a single goddamned word in the entire dictionary that can describe this point between liking you and loving you, but I need that word. I need it because I need you to hear me say it.”<br /><br />I liked that Sky and Holder's connection was developed throughout the story, which helped tremendously when the truth came out. I enjoyed their banter and their chemistry. Yep, that was one hell of a none first kiss!<br /><br />“The moment my lips touch yours, it will be your first kiss.

081099741X|5.0|I will keep this review short, other reviewers have already praised the book - and rightly so:  Excellent and heavy coffee table book, the current price of just $24 is more than warranted.  Beautiful photos (many from the sets) and layout. Every film buff and movie lover with a sweet spot for Wes Anderson should get this book.  A book to keep and cherish. In the coming era of E-books, this once again reminded me why some books work so much better in physical format.
B006LSZECO|3.0|While the twist s and turns kept me reading, the ending seems very far fetched to me.  What kind of a man stays with a wife who was successfully framing him for murder?  A wife who murdered a man who got in her way?  What kind of woman can think of everything, never making a mistake?  Why would she want to stay with a man who doesn't want her, and have his baby?

140006922X|4.0|Aslan offers a challenging way to evaluate the Bible by original documentation and legitimacy of source and to place the many important events in a heretofore generally unavailable chronology. The reader who completes the book will be hard pressed to retain completely his or her original viewpoints but the changes will be  good and constructive.
B00DP3IESY|5.0|What an exciting and simply escalating suspense/Sci Fi movie!  If you want to watch a movie that will keep you at the edge of your chair and wanting more?  This is the one!

B009HV2JT8|4.0|The tittle was intriguing and I had the spare time and money. It was a bit on the weird side, but I like that. Lots of action and good effects, go ahead, check it out...
006202406X|2.0|First of all, the writing is similar to Divergent and Insurgent so while it is still likable and easy to read I didn't expect the prose to get any less monotonous or any deeper. However, since Roth changed the style to two POVs then it gets confusing because we're expected to \\"hear\\" from different characters without any actual cues as to the difference in tone, personality etc. Also the transitions between the two POVs are abrupt, which adds to the confusion.<br /><br />Secondly, and here's where I will get to spoilers, while I appreciate the brevity of being realistic with a story that involves a lot of tragedy I personally don't believe that Roth catered to her audience very well with her ending. This is a Young Adult novel, not a George RR Martin series. Of course I would turn to this kind of book for a captivating story that I would HOPE would have a bittersweet but happy ending. So, I find it disappointing that she felt compelled to kill Tris.<br /><br />If I could re-imagine the ending myself, I would expect something like \\"They are all badly broken--physically and psychologically--but at least they are one step closer to a better society. Maybe Tris can't have kids because of her injuries but at least Tris and Tobias can grow old together and spend the rest of their lives trying to help each other, and the rest of the world, heal.\\" But I take a lot of liberty with my idealized ending and perhaps I'm too optimistic. *sigh*
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I COULD NOT STOP READING THIS BOOK. I loved grown up Danny. King has still got the magic. Glad he shared it.
B00EMAGCJM|1.0|I want my money back! Around and around we go... is the feeling you get when you hear this cd.  It doesnt get anywhere. Its missing the spunk from her two songs \\"we cant stop\\" and \\"wrecking ball\\".  The cd is very immature.  Its like shes an over eagered wanna be mature but she falls short.  The songs are annoying.  If you like to be irriated by the music you listen to then this a cd for you but if want her spunky wrecking ball or we cant stop then buy them on their own. Dont waste money on this. I should have known the moment I open the CD and found stickers inside it.  Stickers? ... Sorry I thought Hannah was murdered... I can understand a mini poster but... Stickers are for kids!  Oh ya and appearing particially nude doesn't make you grown up if anything it reminds me of a teenager gone wild when mommy and daddy aren't around.
B00F52YOPA|5.0|This is the best hidden word game I've played. I'm on level 223 (no that's not a typo)and it's still going. This game is the best value of any game I've purchased and it's more fun than a barrel of kittens! I would give it 10 thumbs up if I had that many thumbs. I really recommend this game, it's just challenging enough to keep you playing with a few twists thrown in to keep you on your toes. Buy it, you won't be sorry.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|And at the end i also felt proud for August. I hadn't realized how dificult is for these kids. Just great
B00CFSWMYM|5.0|I was in love when the first album came out! Sometimes follow up albums are lacking in virility, but I was so pleasantly surprised when I popped this in and they still had it going on.  I love that their albums carry a deviant vibe that makes you want to dance and lose yourself in the moment.  Dark, but energetic.

B00B7Y0206|1.0|It just wont do what you want to look at . I wish i could give this a no star rating its tha bad. It maybe free but its a waste of space
B00E9ZFIMM|1.0|This is a basic note pad. Nothing pro about it. Can't change color or do anything other than make multiple lists . I would not &quot;pay&quot; for this app. Many apps out there that are free that do the same. This one has nothing special.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It's a fun game, but i am not a fan of being pressured to purchase the in app  bonuses or have my play time be cut off
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Lots of options for alarm sounds. Kindle does not have to be on for it to work. The adds are annoying but it's a small price to pay for such a convenient app.
006202406X|5.0|Tris and Four, by the end of the first two books, had already overcome so much, so I wasn't surprised there was more for them to face. Otherwise, why bother with the third book?<br /><br />The explanation for why their world is the way it is, is satisfying, and dare I say brilliant? For Veronica Roth to have come up with this trilogy at such a young age is, I think, amazing. While I do agree that sometimes her writing style needs some finesse, it is still a good story. After all, we are not expecting this book to be listed as a classic someday, and analyzed in an English class. For people to expect that level of writing is silly.<br /><br />This is the perfect book to curl up with at the end of a long day. I can't wait to see what other stories Veronica Roth comes up with. If you are looking for entertainment, this is the book for you.
B00EE3FVSU|1.0|I liked the story and acting.  A cut over most TV shows that is for sure. Lets have more like it.
B00009AOBI|5.0|SHIPPING AND PACKAGING WAS GOOD. ARRIVED ON TIME. ORDERED FOR A FRIEND THAT IS A HUGE CHER FAN. SHE WAS THRILLED AND ONE OF HER ALL TIME FAVORITS.  I WOULD ORDER FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN.

B001CTGQBK|3.0|We had forgotten all of the adult content and innuendos!  But the music and the chance to watch John Travolta as he was just starting out are so much fun for my 13, 14 and my husband and myself!  What a great time!
B00ERIUO02|5.0|Really an amazing album you can have another part of Perry's music ! She is always colorfully and now she is kinda Dark ! Shall I live it
B00FPH51LQ|2.0|I was eager to see this movie when it first came out, so my disappointment was probably more than the average viewer's. It ended up too similar to \\"Men in Black\\" without being as interesting, funny or original. Jeff Bridges mailed this one in - I don't know if it seemed like a better idea when he signed up or if he just took the money and ran. His accent felt fake all the way through, as did the screenplay. The whole thing has a made-by-committee feel. As for something positive, well, James Hong, Mary Louis Parker and the special effects. Maybe those two should have starred in a movie tentatively titled, \\"Dead Asian Guy Kicks Ass.\\"
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I love this game. It is very fun and easy to pick up. I would suggest this game to<br />anyone.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Game is good but an increase in the time limit should be increased WITHOUT having to buy more time. Everyone doesn't have extra money to buy time.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so glad the app store finally got this!! Have been playing this on my phone, but so much easier playing on my Kindle..Thank You app store for listening...Now If you`'ll just get Pet Rescue Saga.. All will be good!!!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|SPOILERS<br /><br />I understand, killing off your main character is the new science fiction thing to do. Oblivion and Elysium (movies) are the two most recent stories to do this.<br /><br />But this novel, then end of the trilogy, killing off the main character was just stupid. On so many levels. But mainly I am irritated because since book one Roth has been building up Tris as an individual, but also in her relationship with Four. Why would you spend three ENTIRE books helping these characters to grow together, and overcome so many obstacles that happen in real life with different circumstances? It gives the reader that hope, that maybe no matter how bad things get (and we went through a lot of terrible things with Tris and Four) you can get through them and things will be better.<br /><br />Roth has most of book 3 building up their relationship, and overcoming the same problem that happened in book 2, but with Tris realizing she will always forgive him. And then Roth kills her. It makes all of that writing seem like such a waste. If she hadn't built them up together, making that one of the major plot lines, then I think I would understand why she killed off Tris. If she did it for the greater good. But.....the reasons that were given felt like excuses.<br /><br />I agree with another reviewer, I think all the problems with this book (because killing of the main character is the worst, but definitely no the only one, why suddenly change the writing style from the first two books? I don't want Four's POV, I have her short stories for that.) I think Roth felt pressured writing this. It was like she cracked trying to write this. Maybe she felt limited by having to wrap it up in one book? My advice...then don't! She would have done so much better and honestly would have probably made more money. Finish it the way you want it.<br /><br />I think Trilogies cab fail because of this. Just write the story, if it's three books then call it a trilogy, but if it's not I'm perfectly happy to keep buying the series if it is a good series.<br /><br />I was in love with this series until I finished (almost) this book. It ruined the whole series for me and now I don't think I want to read any more short stories about Four. I loved the ones out, but now Tris is dead. Who cares?<br /><br />I'm sorry, I really wish this was the book we all wanted to read. I think I might try to rewrite it for my own sanity. Closure.fectly happy to keep buying the series if it is a good series.<br /><br />I was in love with this series until I finished (almost) this book.

0979019710|5.0|I've always been a morning person, but lately I had been dragging my but out of bed at the last possible moment to make it to work on time.  There was a time that I rose early and spent time reading, writing letters, doing crosswords, etc., but I had let that special time slip away.  Now that I have put Hal's Miracle Morning recipe in place, not only am I rising early again and enjoying my quiet alone time, I'm spending the time very productively and changing my life one morning at a time.  I'm at a loss to explain how this hour spent cultivating yourself every morning can change the tone and productivity of your ENTIRE DAY, but it does.  I highly recommend the book and the plan.  Thanks Hal!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game glad we finally got it on kindle hope to keep enjoying it for a long time to com
B00EKQ3YZI|3.0|Enough has already been said in the other reviews - and for those I agree. Why didn't they use Donna's vocals on Midnight Shift ... at first I thought WTF - then realized it wasn't even her. I guess I expected more \\"variety\\" but it seems most of the songs are \\"remixed\\" in a very similar way - adding very little \\"newness\\" to the mixes. I'm a fan of these Verve remixes - Billie Holiday for one. But on this one - I feel they could have done better. After listening to the CD a few times - it seems like all the songs \\"sound\\" the same. And a few do not do justice to Donna's vocals.<br /><br />Now I'm not a PURIST and will say ONLY her original music is the best. I always love a good remix. Guess I just wanted something more in the manner of remixing ... maybe some JAZZ, some SAMBA - something to MIX it up from song to song all the while keeping Donna's vocals.<br /><br />Packaging was ok - can't complain .... I was more interested in the music on the CD.

006202406X|1.0|If her goal was to break the hearts of her fans...she succeeded. After finishing it, I lay in bed crying. I was so frustrated I spent money and time on that book. I was sad that I actually cared about the characters. I just felt cheated. It was depressing with no real pay-off at the end. I get that sometimes there have to be sacrifices for the \\"greater good\\" but it was so unnecessary. Honestly, I stopped caring for the last part of the book. I wish I kept the receipt because I really want to return it. I'm going to buy the first two books in the series and pretend that this one didn't happen.

B00EUUJID6|5.0|This CD is a wonderful Christmas CD.Gianluca Ginoble is the best of the 3 singers who sings Christmas songs wonderfully.He should do a CD singing songs solo because he is better than the other singers.

B000JMKNJ2|5.0|I read this book a while ago, and I really enjoyed it. I don't remember a whole lot of the plot, but I do remember that I ended up keeping this book long enough to get a fine from the library because I had to read it twice and savor it the second time. Some parts were laugh out loud funny, and others made me cry. Locke is unforgettable, and I look forward to the sequels that I just realized it has now. Hopefully we'll get to meet his lady love. She must be interesting to have captured his heart so completely.

B00FWLDHSY|3.0|I was really ready to like this movie. The director, the subject matter.. it seemed like it would be great. But I was really let down. The story had no depth and the dialogue was stilted, at best. The acting was spotty.

B0050CJNJ2|5.0|I wasn't always the biggest country fan, but as I started to get a little older (and more mature), I found the country genre to be much more appealing than any of the hip-hop and pop/rock stuff that is released today.  After listening to the Lady Antebellum singles on the radio, I was pretty impressed with their sound and wanted to dig a little deeper into their catalog.  After previewing Own The Night a few times, I decided it would definitely make a great addition to my CD collection.  I'm a little old-school in that way, I like to own a physical copy of the CD and then I rip it to my computer (or use the Amazon auto-rip feature, which is really great by the way).<br /><br />Anyways, this a really awesome country album, and if by chance you and your significant other are singers, there are a lot of great duet songs on this album you can sing together.  Me and my girlfriend love sitting around, strumming out a few songs on the guitar and singing them together.  If you've heard some of their songs on the radio and still aren't sure about the band in general, there are definitely a lot of great tracks that have avoided the dreaded &#34;overplayed-on-radio syndrome.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;Dancin' Away With My Heart,&#34; &#34;Love I've Found In You,&#34; and &#34;Singin' Me Home&#34; are three great standout tracks in addition to &#34;Just A Kiss&#34; and &#34;We Owned The Night&#34;, two songs you've likely heard on the radio a few times already.  For the most part this is feel-good album, with a few sad songs thrown in the mix to keep in varied.  If you are a fan of Lady Antebellum or country music in general, you can't do wrong picking up this album...I enjoy it much better than their newest release, &#34;Golden.&#34;

I waited month for this book to come out and was so excited as the release date finally arrived.  What a disappointment!  I would like a refund!!!!!!  Shame on you Veronica Roth and Amazon!

1401307957|5.0|It's not all the time we get to see a book which illustrates what the author is telling us in self study and learning.  In this book I believe<br />we are allowed this opportunity.  A tragedy becomes something larger to those involved and everyone becomes something larger<br />than they might have expected through events.  That is not to say we should hope for something &#34;painful&#34; to occur to truly bring out<br />our character, our core being - from which we grow, learn and decide.  In this case an event cause this.  The result appears to have produced a catharsis of imagination and a eventual growth, a thightening of the family, and as a result the contents of this book.<br />It and The Creative License...  Are well worth the reading, viewing and trying.

006202406X|1.0|***SPOILERS****<br /><br />I read both Divergent and Insurgent about a year ago and was like most of us eagerly awaiting the arrival of Allegiant. I didn't know what to expect when I found out it would be dual POV with Tobias and Tris. Usually that doesn't bode well for one of the characters, but honestly I couldn't even fathom the killing off of the MAIN CHARACTER. If there are multiple characters that lead the story and one characters doesn't carry the story, the killing of one of them isn't as detrimental to the story. You can't have two full books and partially a third revolved around a main character which is essentially the whole reason for the story and just kill her off. Besides the obvious distaste for the ending, the whole book kind of fell flat. Yes we did have a lot of questions answered and it was pretty good up until a certain part that hurts to still talk about, but it wasn't the ending to a trilogy that was expected.<br /><br />I understand that Tris died for something that she believed in and it did change the way of life for those around her, but it just didn't seem worth it to me. And man was the last 30 or so pages painful to read and the tears were flowing. The first two books were spectacular and after reading the third I still can help but feeling I wasted my time. I am still stunned at how it turned out and am seriously hesitant to recommend this series to anyone.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Season 2 continues to deliver.  Best show on TV.  Solid screen-writing and casting.  Fun and witty.  Clever and at times suspenseful.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I understand what I read. But it is way to shocking to remember myself that this is about life, what real life is.<br />Veronica Roth I am MOURNING right now.<br />I like the reflections that this ending brought to me, and I believe to everyone that reads it.<br />Not every couple gets to be together in real life and we still have to face life after the death of a beloved one.<br />Everyone of us will die someday.<br /><br />Still, I would like to read a diferent ending in a while, because I would like to read in Veronica's Roth words how it would be if they ended together, what would have happened to Caleb? How would Tobias face Zeke after Uriah's death, how would he dealt with Evelyn and Marcus. Would Tris and Tobias been married? Would they have survived the \\"quiet times\\" together, as Tris says? Or would they have broken up, after the most harsh days have ended.<br /><br />I know... as we face death in our life, the denial starts whith us wondering when the person will come arouund again, that the door will sudenly open and the beloved one will come back from work, or from the gym, church or watever else he/she was usually at that same hour.<br /><br />And as I said I am MOURNING and I am in denial.
006202406X|2.0|I could not stand the ending.  The first 2 books in the series were brilliantly written, and absorbed me....This last book was interesting and I liked the twist to it.  However, the fact that Tris dies, and how she dies, and the whole last 100 pages were absolutely horrific....actuallly even that Uriah dies in such a manor was jut not cool to me.  Also Evelyn couldn't have changed her mind so fast, it didn't make any sense.<br />I wanted for months for this book to come out and I wish I had never read it, it ruined the whole series for me.  I could have understood if there was a more dramatic Twist to the scene with Tris, where maybe Caleb came running out of no where and took the bullet, or an explosion went off and killed both her and David...but not that.<br />I also didn't like the switch back and forth between Tobias and Tris, it was very confusing....I didn't really fell like I was in Tris's head and to be honest, I couldn't really tell the two apart............It was confusing.  Overall, I'm disappointed.  If the author could please rewrite the last 100 pages with an alternative ending, that would be great.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great app. A lot of fun to play and challenging too. Loved the movie and now I love  the game.
B000JQUMPI|5.0|It's a Classic, you have to love it!  I love stepping into this world, it's just amazing.  I feel like a little woman
B000FBJAEG|4.0|I first heard about King & Maxwell from the TV series.  I really liked the show is I picked up the book.  It was a great read.  It was fast pace and it held my interest.  I already brought the next book in the series.
B0094K1WZE|3.0|Not a bad movie. A couple plot flaws. Action scenes worth the time. Classic Cold War plot. It Is a 2 hr movie.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Appreciate the effort and detail of a more than adventurous yet not too over the top chase!  Wonderful to have in family gatherings and game nights.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Whether at home or even at work on &quot;break&quot; I keep playing till I have to wait for another life. This game is awesome and I recommend it to all.
1451695195|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It was well written and very interesting.  This is proof you should read it. Well worth it!
B0082XJGRK|4.0|Awesome ideas on how to live life.  A little boring for the reader who is more interested in fictional novels.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad Candy Crush is finally available for Kindle.  It works wonderfully.  No hang ups.  The screen does not hang up.  Well worth the wait.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I'm sure the grammar Nazis will rip this book up. None of the errors really detract from the read at all. It is a very well communicated story. All of the scenes make sense, end where they should, and are written in a real story-telling feel. There are some obvious plot twists and one in particular that has not only been done before but is one of the most famous of all time. Aside from that it was a page turner. I really liked the characters. They were believable and the dialogue actually reflected the way normal humans talk.
B00E3IZIM0|1.0|Good luck watching UV version of this on a plane or somewhere without an Internet connection.  no digital copy? Only UV BS? No thanks, I'll vote with my wallet.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|The only reason I am giving this book more than one star is because Tobias pushed though and made good choices in the end.<br />I have loved this series from day one and have been anticipating the release of Allegiant since I finished the last book.  I am sorry to say that I will not be re-read big this book, as I am wont to do with most books, because it broke my heart. I know that things in the \\"real world\\" doesn't play out like fiction, but part of why we read fiction is for a break from reality.  I do not expect that every book I read end happily ever after, but I almost feel betrayed or misled because I was led to fall in love with Tris throughout the series and wanted so bad for her to have a happily ever after.
B00EZPCZ5O|3.0|AFI have deserted the textured and complex sound of Crash Love, along with the technical guitar work, in favour of a more stripped down sound that attempts to maintain the dark atmospheric feel of their best albums while churning out radio-friendly power-punk hits.<br /><br />It sort of works. I Hope You Suffer is a bone crunching anthem, while the intro song (The Sinking Night) and the final song (the Face Beneath The Waves) more than deliver in the atmosphere department. Unfortunately some of the songs in between lose out to the more commercial feel of the album, with songs like 17 Crimes as catchy and accessible as they are forgettable.<br /><br />This is by no means a bad album, but this fan is mildly disappointed that some of the best musicians in the business didn't (or weren't allowed to) continue down the road that they were on and instead retreated to the safe-haven of commercial rock.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|King delivers a sober and chilling tale. Enjoyed it as a sequel and as a stand alone tale. But as he has said, this is not The Shining.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Good.book<br />Huge cliff hanger<br />Great third book<br />Can't wait to read the rest<br />Loved it so much<br />So much suspense
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Great vIsuals and sound; didn't give it five stars because I thought it was a little two long. Good plot.
B005HEPN06|5.0|This season is fantastic. But you need to watch the cliff hanger of last season before you watch episode 1 of this season.<br /><br />If you borg what I mean.<br /><br />Yeah?
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|My favorite group.  Love love love the blu-ray.  I will most certainly refer it to my family and friends.  Thank you
B005LAIISA|4.0|As expected this movie just doesn't match the quality of the first 2. I really think they could have come up with some better ideas for a movie. It's not horrible though. My kids really like it. Scat is of course great as always.
B00FPH6A70|5.0|Well..Im not a big scary movie buff but that one comes highly recommended.. Gave me goose bumps the whole way through..
B009Z59ZNE|5.0|I saw the original on tv in 1991 and enjoyed it .And still have it on vhs ,but when I found it on dvd I knew I  had to have it.And it was as good as I remmembered it.And I enjoyed it even more this time.Because when I go away on vacation I can take it with me.Thanks again Kenneth J Joyce
B009KYXEY6|5.0|I'm in love with this cd. It's the best!!!! Recommend it to everyone who loves this type of music for sure. Her voice is amazing!!
B00D5YNQWM|5.0|I love this.  it is very good.  I wish they had more live concerts in DVD form. I wish I could see the one from Las Vagus
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|great game. been waiting a long time for this and instantly added so I can play any where on my kindle fire. thanks!!
B00A7IAF64|5.0|Vin Diesil is the bomb,  love that guy, and Jordana Brewster, she is so beautiful, I love the Dodge Charger, my brother had one in 1971, not quite soupped up as the one in the movie but I loved it!
B000FC0SIM|5.0|Very inspiring and fun to read. I found myself laughing and almost crying a couple time (this is a book about writing for God's sake. Give it a try.
B002PYW26Y|5.0|I loved the movie, but I didn.t like that they jumped ahead almost 30 years from the series. It's the same thing what they did with Star Trek, Superman, Batman. All the series started in the '70s and the movies all started in the 2000 years.
0061353248|5.0|The concrete examples in this book give everyone involved in consumer behavior great insights how we behave and be influenced.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I'm not a real big fan of the &#34;Star Trek&#34; era, but I do like all the movies that were made. Just didn't get into the series
B002CLBJPK|5.0|I'm so glad that I purchased this, especially for the childhood nostalgia factor. The story is still entertaining as well, but the funny part is reading that the film won an Academy Award for Special Effects in 1971. WOW!!! Hahahah!!! you really just have to view it to understand how far FX have come. Still LOVE IT. And not as scary as some Disney films are to the young'uns. Recommended!
B00EL8JCGU|2.0|Another example of why you should always watch the trailers beforehand. This was a remake of a Colin Ferrel movie, only it was more epic,
B00E8AVNAE|2.0|I pre-ordered this because I love all the actors in it and liked the story idea. I thought it might be a bit like Machete, an awesome and campy film. Nope. I won't give too much of a spoiler, as you might want it despite reviews, which I'm sure will be low across the board. Mickey Rourke's rendition of Satan, should be sent to Hell. I don't know what happened to him, but he has no facial expression anymore, and his delivery is sooo.... sooo.... monotone. Danny Trejo, well he plays the same character in all his films, so I expected this. I guess, I thought the story would be a little more exciting, and WAY more campy. Unfortunately, it features none of this. I so don't want to rate this low, but I have no choice. If you are bent on watching it, do yourself a favor and just rent. Don't make an ownership commitment too lightly.<br />Also, the Languages and Subtitle feature on my product didn't work. Apparently not even programmed, even though the folder is there to choose the options. Big, sad, frowny face!
B00EP0KBXM|2.0|Was not the movie I expected from Will Smith. He barely was in it. And his kid acted like a spoiled brat, probably is that way in real life.
B0099114WO|3.0|This was a decent movie for couples night, full of cute jokes and situations which a couple can relate to after being together for several years.  The DVD was of great quality, at a good price and arrived within a few days.
B00FEN1C50|3.0|I didn't think this was a good movie. I didn't watch the trailer, had  I did I wouldn't of got this film.
B0012QE4Q2|5.0|I watched this on TV once and finally found it here on Amazon.  This is an adult subject movie definitely but I love the story behind it for some reason.  I really like Portman and Johansen in this film and feel their acting is great.  My husband found it interesting and didn't mind watching it like he does other films that he refers to as &#34;chick flicks&#34;.
1451629192|5.0|Great Service...Great value...<br /><br />The book I ordered &#34;A Stolen Life was shipped as advertised and reached me on the<br />date specified by the shipper.  The book is in good shape especially for the reasonable<br />price.  I am enjoying  the  book and am very satisfied with the service I received.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Lee
B00DJ80VLS|2.0|I  listened a few times and really wanted to like this album . Love d.t. for years but something missing on there last few albums.I cant understand what happened , intensity and passion r gone.what a shame , at least they made some great previous albums.  Oh well
B009GXHOW4|5.0|The only way to be awesome at minecraft is to get this application or you suck btw<br />Tons of help and wonder
1452110581|5.0|I bought this as a gift for someone and they really liked it. The poems inside are really funny and ring so true if you have a cat.
B003OQ5YDU|5.0|This review isn't about the music (which I would give a 4-5 star anyway). This is a review of my Universal 45 RPM 4 LP boxset. 1 word, amazing! I don't know if there is a difference between the Warner Bros. and Universal box sets other than the size and material of the box. To put it simply, this box set is the definitive version of this album. It sounds absolutely stunning. I'm hearing things that I never heard on the CD version. If you want the best sounding version of Load, make sure to buy one of these boxsets before they're all bought up.
B00AGOGOLE|1.0|I purchased this camera because the reviews were great, however when I opened the app to take a pic nothing happened I kept tapping the screen but it was blank waste of time n money
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I love this app on my iphone so I see it in app store on my kindle fire an download it but not able to connect to facebook on it on my kindle not happy if I cant connect to facebook then I don't need it on my kindle so please help to where I can connect to facebook on kindle fire so I can play
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|This is one of the most amazing TV Series so far!<br />Cant wait to own season 4 on Blu-ray to add to my collection!!!!
B00CSYRHG6|5.0|. . . reminds me very much of Hergé's Dutch &#34;Kuifje (TinTin)&#34; graphic novels I grew up with in the '40-'50s.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|October 23 2013 Season 3 too:<br />I heard about this tv series and decided to watch it. I fell in love with the characters, especially Matt and Mary, as well as Edith and one of the servants name Tom.  I was glued to my sit on every episode and watched it all in 2 days on demand of course. I believe they have a name for watching episodes in a marathon.  I love it that way!!!<br /><br />I can hardly wait for the next season as I have now caught up and watched everything they had done in all the prior seasons up to the horrible ending in the last season!! What a shocker. I will not divulge what it is so as not to spoil it but it is very surprising!
B00FEN1C50|5.0|OK, this is exactly the kind of movie I want to see!  What Transformers should have and could have been... very little language, no sex, just rockin', sockin', bad-a@@ robots.  Gimme More!
B002APU580|5.0|I love this movie so much. The acting in this movie has got to be one of the best I've seen of a Jane Austen book-to-movie screen play. Also, Matthew Macfadyen is an A+ role for Darcy. I love Keira Knightley as well. Everything is just amazing. I've re-watched it countless times.
B00EY7LT9Q|5.0|Wow! Marvel has really stepped up its game with this show! I rate it only behind Homeland as the one to watch on television.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Jam glad its on my kindle . I really enjoy playing Candy Crush. I only wish it gave me more lives :)
B000FC0SIM|5.0|What an inspirational read. Not only for aspiring writers but artists in general. A filmmaker myself, I found Stephen's writing—you end up feeling close to this guy, so I'll call him by his first name—genuine and universal. I was not expecting to learn so much about him either, a nice surprise. The writing is intertwined with his personal life and great writing advice and tips, which made it fun and educational.<br /><br />Stephen is hilarious. I was laughing out loud with some of his passages and anecdotes.<br /><br />A must read—sheer entertainment.
006202406X|1.0|First of all I loved the first 2 book in the series, I could not put stop reading them while this book was dull and not as captivating. I felt like something was missing throughout the book that little extra to make the story interesting.<br />I really didn't like the POV switching. The voices of the characters were too similar and sometimes did not know who POV I was reading. The characters wont as strong too. Also the ending was really bad. After all the ups and downs Tris and Four had to through it would have be nice to end the book on a good note. Also who kills the main character in the book.<br />Just because this book was so bad overall I will not watch the movie(s) or read anymore of Veronica's books. I feel like she was rushed and pressured in writing this book. Also she wanted to be different from the other YA dystopia books with a sad (shocking) ending which hurt fan base.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|Arrived on time, great movie lots of popcorn. A little more character development with the crew.  If this is the direction trek is taking then lead on!
B00EUS9JF0|2.0|Apart from the song New I can't get through any other song on this CD and not cringe over the lyrics. One of the worlds greatest songwriters should put out better lyrical content than this. I found Ringo's releases in recent years to be more enjoyable.<br />Also it seems that it's almost obligatory to have these guys throw in a song about the beatles days which is fine but there have been so many of those songs you could fill a cd with that alone.<br />I was hoping for something really special with this release especially based on the pre- release reviews but wow it just sounds so corny to me. I was expecting to be blown away but this doesn't even rate.
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|If this book fails to bring you to the conclusion all nuclear weapons and their supporting systems are an accident waiting to happen, I have some property for you on the San Andreas fault in California. This was one of those manuscripts you have to pry from your hands so you can get some modicum of sleep.<br /><br />Who knew we were and still are on the brink of a &#34;normal accident&#34;. I guess what really brought it home is that I was employed at one of the places in this book when a good deal of this was happening - a place, thank goodness, where much thought was placed into weapon safety.
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|I love this game so much. The tilt controls are a little hard to get used to but it makes it almost seem real. I love how you can choose different aircrafts from different countries too. If you are a geek about modern military avation. All and all I love this game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|ive been waiting forever for candy crush to be availabe on kindle fire. im on level 180 something and almost quit because i hate having to go on the desktop just to play.
B0026P3G12|5.0|What can I say but WOW!  Susan Boyle has a terrific voice.  She sings like an angel.<br />I have all her cd's and enjoy them all.
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|Its ok.  my daughter just started playing it but its not grabbing her attention.  I think I downloaded for myself. lol
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I've never left a review before but I have to for this book.<br /><br />I have waited for this book for a long time and I can't believe how it ended. I really feel let down by the author.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is as fun as everyone has said. One of the best apps I've downloaded. I'm really glad someone finally made it available on the Kindle.
B003V4AK8E|5.0|Bought for specific game on iMac but game would not allow configuration for controller. That was disappointing. Controller checked out on game console. Oh well
B004ZN9RWK|5.0|Justin Beaver and Lady Gaga...are you kidding me?<br />This CD takes you on a mind blowing journey,<br />it is pure magical music genius at its best!
B007SYWFRM|1.0|It is also amazing how the reward selector, on the scat game, actually slows down...stops (briefly) on a great selection.  Then it slowly restarts moving, to correct itself, comes to a complete stop on a minimum selection. For any game that is a fixed table. Im Uninstalling
B000VUCIZE|5.0|Born and raised Presbyterian with Southern Baptist summers working my grandparents Midwest farm, I had many fears about reading this book.  Will I lose my faith?  Will it destroy my relationships with family and friends that are religious? Will I lose my tolerance for all religious beliefs and believers?  Mr. Harris clearly defines his terms and argues persuasively that high morals and strong values can be achieved and a &#34;good&#34; life lived without a religious foundation. Actually, his arguments go beyond this in his advocacy for reason.  Practical and philosophical. Intellectual yet understandable. You owe it to yourself to set aside your faith for a few hours and explore this perspective.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This game is so addictive! I have to check it multiple times a day. Downloaded it for my daughter and ended up taking it over myself.
B00C061I1M|5.0|Can't quit listening to it. She is even better live. There is a bonus track as well after the last song.
B001BR5NH6|4.0|Definitely a good oldie!! :) I recommend it highly, probably not for young eyes but worth a good indoor movie.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I greatly enjoy this game, but sadly it is another game that almost forces you to spend money to advance.
B009GFEOY8|1.0|It looks like this has no ink in it or something because after I let it sit on my counter the picture came out horrible
B00F5FBE82|5.0|One of the best albums out right now, classic drake, hiphop, he will be around for a while,  some of his best work.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I had such high hopes for this book. After reading the first two in a series you have certain expectations in the ending book of a trilogy. You expect the author to redeem the pain, hurt and tragedy that has happened. You expect to finish it feeling like the story was really finished. Like there was some purpose. This book finished, but that's about all. You are left with the same pain you experienced before, but now you know there is nothing else left to become of it. Although there was a purpose to the unfortunate ending, you can't help but think and feel it should have ended differently.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Wow ..I thought I knew a lot about our history but lo and behold I learned a little more by reading this book..<br />It was a sad commentary on people and how they destroyed many children's lives..I found it offensive that they viewed these children as a means to an end for themselves  and all wanted the pick of the liter..I actually hurt for these children who were totally denied the love of a parent as well as a proper upbringing..the government should be ashamed of themselves for not following through and seeing that these children  were well cared for and that the adopters were seeking children in good faith..this part of our history was another disgrace ..no different than than when the slaves were sold for auction...after being torn from their country and family..another of Americans foibles..<br />The book was written quite well and was easy to follow...
B00DIJQAI6|3.0|I'm a huge fan of sonic games and the Sega all star racing games for the consoles. This game isn't really close to it. The maps are dull, controls are choppy since you move by rotating your phone/tablet. The races feel boring. It is cheap which is a plus, but I honestly think you could find a free racing game out there that's a lot more polished and funner to play.
0143124544|5.0|This was one of the best (if not THE best) books I have ever read.  It has everything.  Great love story being the one that got me.  If you read nothing else, read this one.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|me and my year old daughter love this game! she likes to watch the minions and laugh at their silly antics! it keeps her and I entertained for hours!!!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I will choose a well written sad ending over a poorly written happy ending.  But, I prefer a well-written happy ending.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's a fun game to clear your head of any issues .I enjoyed playing this game when I wake up or just couldn't sleep.
B0089LOKHG|2.0|I agree with all of the negative posts - the ending was way too abrupt.  After all of the build-up, that was how it ended?  So disappointing.  I had to re-think the ending, just for some closure.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this it's challenging to my head so I can be a master at that game and beat it.
B00B7VPKMY|4.0|The music is complete, and that's why I bought it. The box set is small and convienient. The price was right!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I was introduced to this by my niece, since then I have done it every day, I am absolutely addicted.  It has got my soft wlinterized body into shape again just in time for summer.  It is tough, but because it is only 20 minutes you tend to give it everything you have got.  I am 55 so it is not just for young people.  Excellent stuff.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I enjoy playing the game it's fast and easy to play. The o my problem I have had was having the game freeze at the end of an tournament and before beginning another. I have had to delete the app and redone load it.I've had to do this twice.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|No one does character development as completely and as concisely as Mr. King. He writes like you think so you just get lost in the story. This story was an awesome closure to the awesome shining so much so I might read it again my insights will be different now. Recommended wholeheartedly!
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|I love this product. I've lost a lot of excess weight since getting the Pulse (and the Withings scales - a killer combo by the way). The simple act of measuring your health metrics is powerful in that you'll find yourself doing that 'little bit extra' that makes all the difference. Also, I'm happy that it's not a 'watch-like' device like the FitBit because (1) I like to wear my antique LeCoultre timepiece; and (2) at some point int he near future it's rumoured that Apple will launch a watch-like device (which I'd consider getting). I think that Withing's equipment quality, metrics displays and their App are much better than FitBit's too (this was after conducting a lot of research).
B001N3GUIE|5.0|Love this old movie.  The robot almost steals the show.<br />Imagine, Leslie Nielson in a serious role - and as a love interest.
B00DJ4PIBK|5.0|It's about time that Lego came up with the Friends Lego advent calendar for girls! She's going to absolutely love it!
B0000047EC|4.0|This is a good, a very good recording by a couple of very talented people.  I like it.  It could use a bit more 'edge' to the performances, but i find that I listen to it  often.  Recommended.
B00EJOCB4G|4.0|My son, who already plays the game, was very excited to get this Lego for his birthday. Even though there are lots of pieces, it did not take too long for him to put together. Great gift.
B00CEB5QU2|5.0|Works as advertised ,can't ask for more. A little tricky to turn on/off but having the option for unlimited data usage ( switching sd cards and USB sticks)makes it a minor complaint
B00E9ZFIMM|2.0|If all you want is an app to start and save with no options to change the font, date, reorder, export or even NAME your files this is a good app if you get it free. Really, some of this stuff is simply elementary. How can you expect to make money from something that people can't manipulate enough to change the name of a file? This is just a sad little app. No way I'd pay money for it. Two stars until it adds any features at all, just for being quick and well...it starts. However, by the time it's upgraded to actually do something, we'll all have probably gotten used to something else, not as willing to give this a shot. Sad.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this is absolutely the best game ever. ever since I started playing it in facebook, I had been wondering when it would ever be on kindle app store. thank you so much!!!!! ;)
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Easy to use. Set it and forget. Multiple alarms and use your own music.Variety of loud sounds to wake u.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|If you saw this movie, you have to be 80's child.  Brings alot of beautiful memories.  I had to show my kids what awsome were the 80's.

B004BV16PW|4.0|These are a great Tights.  The gusset is top notch, keeps my junk cool.  I have not tried to run in these but I did some plyometrics to test them out and they were comfortable.  All in all, solid.<br />Here's the bad news guys.  As great as these are, they're not tight enough to succeed in returning blood and lymph fluid in any significant way.  I think they great and comfortable for running and they might even help support when you have very very minor injuries.  However, I prescribed compression stockings etc for my patients and to be functional, these tights would need to be much tighter.  Source: I am a family medicine resident and a certified personal trainer.<br />Overall though, these are very well made. At the least, this is great for cold weather running.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love the game, the one thing I least dislike is the level so close to end and then it happens,the move is not in my favor.
B003G4W49C|4.0|A little slow getting started but it was all necessary to lay the groundwork for the rest of the story.<br /><br />I'm glad I read the forward. This helped me understand who and what kind of characters it was about as well as their trials and  challenges.<br /><br />This book even helped me understand who I am, a real accomplishment.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Chrome cast works great only glitch I had was I had to up date my wifi router's firmware after that everything works great
0753827662|3.0|I thought the story line was great. Good suspense and crazy switch back. I thought the flow of the story was creative and definitely gave a new face to who can be a sociopath. Very clever.<br />I was frustrated by the vulgarity that was used in telling the story. I was surprised that such &#34;intelligent&#34; characters were so crass. If that is how the well educated speak it is unfortunate for the rest of us. I can understand a few cuss words but it went way beyond what was necessary.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great little game to take your mind off of things. I love the graphics and can't wait to see if there will be more places to race through.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Probably the best last book in a trilogy that I have read in a long time. I will admit that at first I did not care for the alternating of perspective between Four and Tris but by the last third of the book it made sense. Really enjoyed all three books as with all excellent series it makes me wish there were more books to come with these characters.
B002CLBJPK|5.0|I have been looking for the original Bedknobs and Broomsticks DVD forever! Fast and on time delivery! It was a magical moment watching this childhood favorite of mine!!
B004OC07F8|4.0|Great book. Interesting approach to strategic planning and market opportunities. Creating blue oceans in a world dominated by red oceans requires innovation and guts.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Several plot lines converging. I am half way through the book. It is a mystery crossing generations and different families. I can't wait to find out the truth.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Like most, I got addicted to the game after futile resistance. But I ended up stopping because the app on my android phone would freeze all the time. When I got my beloved Kindle Fire and saw the app was not yet available, I said &quot;oh,well!&quot; But the minute I saw it , it was like &quot;Booyah!&quot;<br />It's like I never stopped. It saved my spot and everything.<br />I am seriously trying to curb the crack like tendencies this game brings out of people but will admit it is one of the best game ever created!!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I had a lot of ups and downs with this book, but in the end (and I mean VERY end) I was satisfied with how the author ended the book.<br /><br />Maybe I looked at the meanings and hints to things that others who rated this so poorly didn't pick up on.  I thought the ending was fitting and flowed exactly the way I would have imagined considering the beginning that was introduced to us in Divergent.<br /><br />*SPOILER PART ALERT*<br />I've never ever liked books where one of the main characters die, however I think Veronica pulled this off beautifully. Way to go girl!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I was looking for a Bible on the Kindle with multiple versions available. This one took the cake. Although it has way more versions than I would ever need, I downloaded the ones I wanted and no longer flip through the pages looking for something specific. Just search and go!  Great job!
B00A2H9WW8|5.0|Honestly, when I first began to read the casting information on Carrie I was ecstatic to read the casting of Julianne Moore and Chloe Grace Moretz as Carrie and Mrs. White respectively. When the first few trailers came out I was honestly wondering if they were going to retell the actually Stephen King story and less of a remake of the original. After viewing the film, having read the books several times, I can say that I truly feel that this version of the film is fantastic to be able to stand on it's own.<br /><br />Not only are the actors in the film playing their perspective roles with gusto, but the film finds a satisfactory balance with the original 1976 film and the Stephen King \\"Horror\\" novel. Now I'll be the first to admit that the movie itself is basically beyond being able to be filmed exactly as presented as it was in the novel (Multiple perspectives, News paper articles, portions of victim testimonies). I found that even in this and the original film, that they both found a way to \\"enhance\\" the Prom Scene itself. In the novel the Prom is basically done from the outside with Carrie sealing the doors and a fire breaking out. In this particular version they even go so far as to give Carrie a true motivation to begin to reap her revenge on the poor high school students.<br /><br />I was particularly pleased with Chloe's portrayal of Carrie White. It was easy to sympathize with her from her upbringing, to the constant torment that she received at school. When she was happy I felt it and when she was broken and belittled I completely understood. It's hard not to watch this film and compared it to Sissy Spacek's portrayal of the character. Carrie in my mind was always quiet and reserved and deeply saddened and I felt that overall Sissy's portrayal was more of a offsetting and slightly more spooky of the two, but I felt that of the two Chloe carried a more humanizing element to Carrie herself.<br /><br />This brings me to my review of Julianne Moore's portrayalof Miss White. I was so satisfied with her quiet performance. I felt the love that she had for Carrie underlying in every line that she spoke. It was not overplayed and satirical like in the original. I loved that fact that they even went so far as to add in the self harm that she frequently caused herself in the novel. What was more impressive was how dark it was to watch this woman who so obviously loved Carrie deeply could quickly drop into religious zealot like behavior and cause harm to her daughter as much as she could to herself.<br /><br />That aside, I was mostly pleased with the supporting cast, Judy Greer above all else. I could see the need for these characters to be more age appropriate than the original, but Ms. Desjardin stood out above all the rest. It was easy to see Judy Greer truly channeling her motherly instincts to defend Carrie at any turn that she could and that made it easier to see that Chloe's Carrie cared and appreciated her as well.<br /><br />The special effects were just that, it is a truly quickened sequence and mostly a build up in the film. The telepathy this version is far more CGI oriented and that is not a bad thing in all honest. It made the Prom that much more original from the first and it certainly made me feel that the telekinesis that Carrie displays to be far more fantastical, just as it is in the novel. It takes a while to push the films R rating, but in the end it fulfills just what SK set out for in the original novel and that is a deeply disturbing and horrifyingly beautiful character study. This version of the film and the original are on par with each other and certainly timeless in story related matters. The difference is stark and strong in both and I'd honestly recommend both for any collector. The true beauty in this remake/re imagining is director Kimberly Pierce took a story as deep as Carrie's defined it, not as a horror story, but a tragedy. I truly feel that is for the best.
B00004BZ0N|3.0|I searched for LP expecting an actual vinyl record but they sent a cd. Good cd and they got it to me in good timing so I guess it's mostly my fault for not paying attention
B0091REZMW|4.0|Great game. Very addictive. Will have you glued for hours.  You will find yourself spending more money for diamonds. This is the only drawback.
B00D0Z2JQK|5.0|This product is awesome And the movie is so amazing i love this product so mucho! And anyone can buy it from this Seller the item arrived very fast And it shiped from Japan! I love everything about this an about this Seller And the price is worth it And the set also have the 2008 soecial dragón ball Goku And friends return!
B00EAIMGDW|3.0|Tiny Thief is a game that worked well and was enjoyable for me, including its relaxed pace, but I was disappointed to see the tired and unnecessary cliche of the damsel in distress show up as the main motivating factor and rudimentary attempt to create a sense of story. This certainly shows a lack of creativity on the developer's part in what was otherwise a very clever game with some unique puzzles, good visuals, and fun gameplay. As a result, I'm left with something of a hollow feeling. Ultimately, the Tiny Thief's journey is pretty purposeless, except for an instant infatuation worthy of a good eye-rolling.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have waited forever to be able to play this game in my kindle! Now I can catch up with all the other candy crush addicts!
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|A tale of love and loss in a time of breathtaking scientific advance. How Ms Gilbert had the time to become an apparently expert bryologist in the process, I will never fathom. It is not a good read. It is a great one.
B007L5LD9O|5.0|I am male and 72 years old.  I remember all my female cousins trying to match me to their friends.  I was not wanting to offend them<br />but also watching their selection processes.  I did not marry one of them.
B007WEQ3K8|5.0|It's was very interesting and I like the mini games. It doesn't take a lot of time and energy. I use it for my kids and free time.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it!!!!!! Even when I'm stuck for weeks or months I always come back and replay other levels to keep me going!!!! So glad it's on the kindle now!!!
B00BOLE7X0|5.0|Great movie.... Well acted... Such an incredible time in history. Worthwhile to  watch and very moving. Really enjoyed this piece of work.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's a fun and challenging game for all ages it's the best. It has different levels THAT are awesome!Love it alot.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It doesn't take very long to play but it is fun! I wish there were more than 10 levels to play.
B00EZPCZ5O|5.0|I just seen these guys Sunday at the Marquee theater in Tempe. GREAT PERFORMANCE! They played quite a bit from the new album and it sounds great! I plan on ordering this on payday since my spending money was practically depleted due to the concert. I wished they had the album for sale there. A special early release for the fans at the concert, but oh well. If you like the newer stuff that AFI has been releasing, you would like this cd. I myself am a fan of both new and vintage AFI. Davey delivers goth like melodic vocals with dark lyrics that will have you singing the songs for days as you go about your day. Lol I know I have! This album feels a bit similar to Sing the Sorrow as well. This just might become one of my top fav AFI albums! I highly recommend!<br /><br />p.s. When AFI performed, particularly \\"I hope you suffer\\", the vibrations from the music could be felt throughout your whole body! It is such an adrenaline rush! If you ever get the chance to see them live, DO IT! Take a vacation or sick day, get your best friends, your GF/BF and go see them! You will not be dissapointed!
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|Quite honestly, this game is really well done. Although it may take a bit to get used to, once you get used to tapping the screen instead of tactile sticks, it runs smooth as silk. It runs with no hiccups on my KHDX.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really enjoy this game. I created a horse and enter competitions and everything. It's super fun, addicting, and is the perfect game for any horse lover!
B007WEQ3K8|3.0|The very first game I attempted to &quot;train&quot; my brain - seemed very difficult to me.<br /><br />The game just happened to select FAST moving 3D dice that I had to add that total of (2 numbers showing on each) as they whizzed through the screen- in seconds. Then I was supposed to put the total in a small box immediately after.<br /><br /> I was un-able to complete this task. How is this &quot;brain training&quot;? It feels more like brain frustration. At least to me.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|WAITING for ever for this to be on my Kindle. Keeps me busy for hours, and can get Help FROM. friends. Thanks !!
B004LWZW24|5.0|As expected watched once got what I wanted remembered I had already seen it good for a Halloween movie to watch
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This is the best GAME I ENJOY PLAYING SO MUCH ENJOY PLAYING ENJOY PLAYING ENJOY PLAYING AND would recommend this game to e everyone ENJOY PLAYING ENJOY PLAYING ENJOY PLAYING
0316056863|5.0|I loved it because I identified with it.  And while that may seem to be a very strange thing for a 40+ year old white male to say, it is nonetheless true.  Roger Ebert used to say - and I'm paraphrasing - that it's not what a film is about, but how the film is about it.... and I think that translates nicely here.  Tina Fey's writing could be stories, commentary, and insight about almost anybody.  Doesn't matter.  It's how she goes about it that makes all the difference.<br /><br />And how she goes about it is to weave her almost Proust like recollections and insight into what ends up being quite the powerful commentary for women - yes - but in my view a generation or two.  It's a book I'll save and hand to my daughter when she's old enough - and by old enough I mean to handle the subject matter but also to take some very important things away from the stories within.  There are some really nice life lessons here.<br /><br />She shares things she's learned from influential people and moments, sometimes with slick humor, other times with an almost uncomfortable thud.  And I mean that last part as a compliment.  There's something very weighty and poignant about the one and only time she screwed another young woman out of a part when she was in a position to do so very early on - and what she took away from the experience.  And there's humor tinged with a bit of sadness when you read about someone's experience as an outlier in college.  Not sad as in pity for them but a sadness in either identifying with it or wondering whether you may have not noticed...And then there's sarcasm and wit and asides that just make the whole thing fun.<br /><br />There are times when Tina Fey wasn't \\"centered\\" but none of it is truly tragic or depressing.  And that, in many ways, is remarkably refreshing.  This is a healthy look at a life.  I don't know whether she thinks of herself as principled, but I do, and it's clear, when you take the work as a whole, how those principles developed.<br /><br />I love comedy.  I love performances.  I am fascinated by the creative process.  To have the chance to explore that process through the eyes of someone who is willing to let you see it is a true treasure.  So, this is not a book for the \\"dirt behind the scenes at SNL,\\" but rather a rare opportunity to see how a wonderful mind works.  Writers are the lifeblood behind shows.  We don't often get the chance to learn about them.  In this instance, we do.<br /><br />It's a fascinating, delicious, enjoyable read.  A rare insight.  Nicely done.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Maybe it is just a soap opera, but it's a soap opera with wonderful acting and really compelling story lines. We watch this on Amazon Instant rather than on TV, and highly recommend it for binge watching.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I didn't think this book would be that interesting but I was hooked. Great book with great insights into human behavior from a dog's point of view.
B001974DG0|5.0|Yes, this book is one that will pull you in and won't let go until you finish.  I loved this book, the way it was delivered, the pace, the changing of scenes and the drama at every turn. Well done Mr. Koontz, you are a master storyteller!  I plan to read many more of your books.
0805047905|5.0|Was a great buy! My 18 month old loves this book! She always wants it read over and over again!
B0049VVE7Y|5.0|The suspense and the action are superb.  The writing isn't the best, but it the zombie apocalypse for crying out loud....only so many ways to say that.  I do like the very creative ways they come up with the kill zombie's though.  =)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is, well in my opinion is so much better better than Temple Run, Temple Run 2, Temple Run Brave, and my LEAST favorite of them Temple Run Oz. The game Temple Run is so old and blah. The game Temple Run is also based on the lamest movies such as; Brave and Oz the great and powerful.  The reason I most think Subway Surfers is such a great game is because their are so have been so many places that the game has gone on tour to.Miami and Paris to the Halloween theme of the part of the tour to the New Orleans.  And those are some of the reasons why I think the game, Subway Surfers, should be rated FIVE STARS!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|COOL but I never got to get to all of the missions but it's awesome cause it has some really good graphics and its free thats cool.
1476727651|1.0|This is my first Stephen king book I have ever read, so I don't have much to compare. but I have to say this book was a HUGE disappointment. I was not impressed, or scared at all. I found this book VERY hard to keep me interested and keep reading. the first few pre chapters were GREAT.. HUGE downfall starting with chapter one in teenytown. I thought this book was VERY boring. and Stephen king used several words over and over again.. ie. (apt, turnpike) not very imaginative . I was upset that this was yet again another vampire book that I was not at all impressed by. and the character names from the \\"true knot\\", not very thought out at all . ie.(barry the chink, rose the hat, anna the apron)...  every name was \\"someone THE something\\"... very boring. this book made me wonder what the big hype about Stephen king even was...... sorry but I was very bored and eventually upset. hope someone can find this a useful review and do themselves a favor by NOT PICKING UP THIS SNORE-FEST OF A BOOK \\"/ .....
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|This is somewhat easier than the original. I enjoy the challenge. I'd certainly get it for relaxation. It allows you to move on much more quickly and you won't be bored.
B003Z2LAAO|5.0|Many friends of mine have recommended me to buy this Grand Canyon 3D movie !<br />After viewing the film was amazed and was not disappointed !<br />Was a good choice to buy .
B00CTT9646|5.0|{Spoliers} I loved the movie very much and was very anxious to get it. Sure, it does a flip flop of Star Trek: Wrath of Khan, but Bennedict Cumberbatch was AWESOME. The phaser gift set was a nice addition.
1603420398|5.0|The biggest problem I had with Beyond the Square Crochet Motifs is deciding which motif I wanted to try next.  If you're tired of crocheting squares take a peek at the circles, hexagons, triangles, and unusual shapes patterns offered.  The book includes the usual basics of crocheting and troubleshooting problems with your stitches.  The 144 motif patterns range from beginner easy to more challenging for the experienced.  The motif patterns are written as well as pictured in symbols.  I had a good time trying out a few different patterns. [...]
B004EPZ08E|5.0|Such great performances by Spacey, Aniston and Farrell. I never laughed so hard in my life; my sides hurt from how funny this was.
0525952926|5.0|Ken Follett can spin a  yarn as well as any person in todays large group of writers.  His research is very well done and his work is always very readable.  Highly recommended for anyone who wants to read a continuously unwrapping story with well developed characters.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|SO happy to have this on Bluray now. Yeah, I'm not 100% with the changes Lucas did, but it is his creation and he can do what he wants with it... but Han shoots first! Nice interface, packaging, and extras. A worthy purchase for the Star Wars fan out there!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|When I first started I was very disappointed because when I had to update it totally started my game progress over. I am happy now that I continued to play because I'm really enjoying this game very much and the graphics are exceptionally well done.
B004A8ZWVK|4.0|It is a good movie. There was good acting. Storyline interesting. Need to watch it again. Would recommend this movie.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|King is a master story teller - he is one of the only authors I look up from and notice I've just read 300 pages - and be happy I'm not quite 1/2 way through.<br />Is the story predictable? Maybe, especially if you read a lot of King. Enjoyable read? Absolutely, a great book to get lost in on a cozy afternoon.<br />Thank you Mr. King for yet another enjoyable ride
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|I have watched this movie several times. My daughter-in-law recommended it. I am not a Woody Allen fan, but I did enjoy this movie.

B003L20IHE|5.0|I loved the movie and I would recommend it for anyone that loves a great love story, a must have
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is so hard to play I just gave up.  Don't have it anymore on my Samsung Tab 7.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game I honestly think I'm addicted to it you should go and download it now it is amazing
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|An absolute worthless piece of crap. It frickin' takes you to the Internet browser. The YAHOO appnis better than this, and YAHOO is crap. I am converting to Bing now.
B00062IDCO|5.0|Voyager is my favourite Star Trek series, so naturally I have been slowly building my collection.<br /><br />These boxsets look nice, and the DVDs are relatively easy to get to.  The box itself is encased in a kind of dual plastic sleeve.  You remove the top part of the clear sleeve, and the lower part had the big graphic that covers the discs so it looks nice.  You can slide the box out from there, and it actually opens like a book which is nice.  Each disc has its own 'page' Each set is a differently coloured plastic, but the plastic itself might be seen as flimsy and might break easily.  If you take care of your things though, this shouldn't be a problem.  My outer plastic shell has gotten its share of scratches and dings from moving and normal usage, and I find it can sometimes be a bit frustrating to get the box back into it, due to the lip at the bottom it refuses to slide into.  (Much like getting that last card into a deck of cards) The back of the sleeve does show an episode list as well.<br /><br />The menu is full on Star Trek, and has an animated intro, I was not disappointed.  The last disk also has a bunch of special features too!  It's overall a nice boxset, and I would recommend it to any Voyager fan!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm  so excited they finally have this game on Amazon... I use to always play in on on my husband's iPod  but now that they have here it's way better then me borrowing my husband's iPod...

B00CW6DAKC|2.0|This gamw would be awesome if it actually allowed you to connect through facebook like it says. I like playing this game but there are others out there that will allow friends to help, so i figure if this issue is not fixed within a week i will delete this app.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I didn't want to try the game because I'd heard it was addicting, well it's true! I was asked to try to get passed a level and I was hooked! I played on a laptop until they finally added an app for kindle. warning, if you try it, you may become a candy crush addict!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Now I know why everyone love this app! This game is so much fun and surprisingly challenging! Not your ordinary match three game . Colorful graphics and helpful tutorial on how to play for newbies like me. If you have never played you will not be disappointed. Appears to be a full version.
B00F880BWG|4.0|2 episodes into the new season i was struck with both the strengths and weaknesses of Rick's new camp life. The sense of hope delivered in the last scenes of the third season and the first episode of the fourth season immediately starts to crumble as the second episode arrives, ending the second episode with both intrigue as to what is happening to the group and deep anticipation for what is to come. the first episode alone provides a fresh perspective on Rick and the other characters, which will make it interesting to see how this will contrast with how they were influenced to make tough decisions in past seasons. i have fallen in love with the surviving characters in the group, and i know it will be a good show to see what obstacles, zombie hordes, and people that they will have to face in the new season.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I hate to be a repeat of everyone else, but I waited for months for this book. I mean I pre-ordered it and everything. only to read it and discover so many loose ends,a split POV and what I feel to be an unrealistic ending to a book series I had come to love. Was I expecting a happily ever after? No, I was expecting an awesome plot with mind blowing twists like the first two books. Instead I get a plot filled with all kinds of genetic crap and argument fallacies that were just ridiculous. Lets not forget that the ending makes the journey,trials and tribulations of the first two books seem like they were to rub two pennies together. Allegiant i but a shadow of its predecessors. (P.S. The Allegiant werent even that big of a deal in the book! see more confusion)
B00900NAFI|4.0|As a grad student, I needed a comprehensive and accurate dictionary to help me with my reading and writing.  As a reference, it has contained every word I have needed to look up. The voice pronunciation aspect wasn't something I went looking for as a must have feature, but it has helped.  I will keep using it and see how it goes.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I is a great game. I would recamind these game to friends any time. Thank you for these game for kids.
B009PAETCG|1.0|I would give it zero stars if possible.  You can't even try it in kids mode without paying $10.  Games that say they are free and are not should be removed from app store.  Who can we contact about blatant deception?
B006MR2ZQC|5.0|product is great for any boy or girl that loves Legos. My son just has a field day with all of them
B004X6PRO6|4.0|It took some time to adjust mentally to the voice, the tone of this book as it was quite different. For the first few pages, I entertained the thought of quitting. But I'm so glad I didn't. The life, the pain, the hardship, the dark humor, and the love is woven into a rich tapestry. I am changed by the experience of this book. Do yourself a favor and read this.
0375869026|5.0|I read this book out loud to my kids and I would have to stop frequently and have someone else take over because I was crying or laughing too hard! It is so sweet and just pulls at your heart.  It is a great book for teaching children (and adults) empathy without being preachy.

B00BD99JMW|5.0|I know everyone is mad because the author made a chancy choice with one of the characters. And I hate when a book doesn't end the way that I want it to. But that doesn't take away that it was a very good book. Any book that can make to cry over its characters is a good book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for this game to be available on my kindle .  It is much more enjoyable than my little phone.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very fun for my seven year old. She loves escape games and this is her favorite so far. Definitely download this!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Just as much fun as on the computer. I am delighted there's finally an app for Kindle. Connects easily to my Facebook account so I didn't have to start over at level one.

B00985E3UG|5.0|I bought this E-book after finding a recommendation and reading the reviews here. I learned alot, and was a entertaing read as well. I definitely recommend for anyone learning about nutrition and health, it really did increase my awareness about my own diet and cravings etc..  I highly recommend, worth the price, enjoy!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|my opion fun um fun and fun a game is fun it is fu it is  fun and it is a game to pass time
B004K8WPUQ|5.0|I use my Canon T5i mainly for video and the on board mic leaves less than desirable results. After dropping the preamp volume on the camera to 2 &#34;clicks&#34; above zero, and the level on the rode set to +20, I get very good quality in audio now. Definitely worth the money.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was near tears when they came to the end of the road they were travelling on.  Christian is having such a hard time admitting that he also is in love with Ana.  I do hope that they will find their way back.  I look forward to reading the next book...In the beginning I thought it was too graphic for my taste but their relationship pulled me in.....
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I only kept reading through this out of curiosity. It does not live up to the first book in the series. This poor rating is not about who is killed off. By the end of the book I honestly didn't even care who was killed. That right there shows how this book is so far below the standard of the first one. It feels like a rehashing of the second book, and the little kissy face scenes are repetitive and annoying, I wanted to barf just like Christina.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Like always  they are just awsome.. good conditions fast... Good packeging to protectthe item. Very happy with the item.. thanks
B007WEQ3K8|3.0|Downloaded this app for the FAOTD and well it was fun... for about 10 min. Most of the games are boring to be honost but its a quick start and play app. Worth the download if your just looking for something to play for 5 min intervals.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|Just as describe was for a gift and she is in love with the movie. Even the casing was on perfect condition
B00EAIMGDW|4.0|Fun game.  I like this kind of puzzle solving/hide and seek game.  I hope the developer fixes the problem with level 25 for the 1st gen Fire - program closes will not load the level.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|Was a gift for myself. Love the avengenrs collecting all of the movies..one of the hardes things is getting it with the case intact.. and they did a wonderful job
B0014DQSGW|5.0|Two Weeks Notice was such a cute movie, great feel, feel good. Highly recommended to all romcom lovers. Also great casting duo.
B00EEDJM2Q|3.0|It's a pretty good game, I got it for my nephew to play.  He is 5 years old and likes it.
0439023491|5.0|We bought the Hunger Games set of three books for our 14 year old granddaughter last Christmas. She thoroughly enjoyed reading the book.
B00CP9F9PK|5.0|I got the book today and have already fallen in love with it. The cover looks amazing and it has quite a few short stories in it. I would recommend it to anyone who likes sci-fi short stories.
0439023513|5.0|We bought the Hunger Games set of books for our granddaughter for Christmas. She thoroughly enjoyed reading the books. They are interesting to read and certainly encourages reading which is great.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|A friend recomended this and I downloaded it on the spot.  Now I am hooked.  I keep all sorts of notes and lists on ColorNotes and didn't stop with my phone, added it to my Kindle, as well.
0446547646|4.0|Loved the story line- not too happy with the ending! Typical Nicholas Sparks- Cried  my eyes out  at the end.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is one of the best calculators I have found, and I have tried more than a few.  This one has the greatest feature of all - keys big enough you actually hit what you were meaning too.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very stimulating for  your brain.  Love puzzles and this one is great, really makes you think! Love the challenge .  The fun factor is top notch.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally !!!! Glad that's it's now available on the kindle now they need to work on Instagram.. Yea Kindle great.
1577314808|3.0|the books ok but not what I was looking for. Read half and lost interest. I think &#34;Be Here Now&#34; by Baba Ram Das is much better.
B0027MJU00|4.0|After reading Gone Girl I had to read another book by Flynn.  The chapters in Dark Places chronicled a ghastly sequence of events which kept the story organized and easy to follow.  Although there were many characters, each had a definite personality, evil as some were, every one remained an individual.  The ending was abrupt , however, the crime was solved and there is only one place to go, which I will not mention here.  Perhaps there will be another book picking up where Dark Places left us.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|I love Karl Urban and this was fun and lots of action.  It is not one of the best or my favorites but I did enjoy it.
B00BXI0IHS|5.0|Such a well developed story, brimming with detail that speaks of thorough research. I'm not a particular fan of historical novels and decided to read this one only because I had seen an interview with Gilbert about the book. Well, once I started I could not put it down. Gilbert is an excellent story teller, finding the right balance between developing characters and descriptions.
B001P9KR8U|4.0|The movie shows many that we should be grateful for what we have.  Befire the movie, I did not put mych though tinto how different lives are in todays world.
B008JFUORW|5.0|The movie was funny not as funny as the first a big fan of the hangover movies thanks amazon have a nice day :)
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun to play. Good mind teaser.<br />Smiling at times, frustrated at others.<br />Not too bad for free.TA TA for now.<br />Smiling well.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|SO ADDICTED TO THIS GAME. DOWNLOADED IT A FEW DAYS AGO.FAMILY AND FRIENDS LOVE IT TOO. ONE OF THE BEST GAMES ON MY KINDLE.
B00CUKTG2Q|5.0|Amazing! Everything was just what I expected it to be. I would have to say this is their best album yet.
006202406X|1.0|Loved the first two books. The plot in the third installment left a lot to be desired. This is the only book in the series that I found easy to put down to go to bed, without finishing. The end was incredibly disappointing, after spending three books watching the characters develop. Considering deleting the books off of my nook since I doubt I will ever have the desire to re-read....
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Always wondered what happened to Danny when he grew up (REDRUM!)  Glad to see that, again, good triumps over evil.<br />Stephen King is a master at writing horror that keeps you up at night. It's a real page-turner. Loved it!
B00EKQ3YZI|1.0|Whoever thought of the idea of remixing Donna Summer's great originals and actually green lighted this release should be ashamed. Her powerful vocals are buried under mindless irritating high pitched sound effects ... some of which are intentionally off key. My only assumption is that these types of remixes are meant to be heard at Ecstasy & Molly parties where the drugs are used to heighten the craziness. (Listen to the awful side one of Cher's new CD as an example.) Don't waste your money on this garbage. Instead search out the originals as they were meant to be heard because Donna's voice is still one of the very best ever recorded.
B00FPH3YQA|3.0|I t was entertaining. Do not set your hopes too high however. decent entertainment for Afriday night with nothing to do.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Sweet! Been waiting...now its here on my kindle.Super excited that I can play because my Windows phone is crap.0 with no decent apps.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|everything blake does is great, he really does grandaddys gun very good, sure be cool if i could see him live sometime
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I am so glad to see this game now available. It is my favorite! I am bummed though that it doesn't sync with my android cell phone game as far as extra lives that have been given.
B009O07NMA|5.0|i love this band-makes you want to get uo and move and get loud-cruise is great and really liked it with nelly too
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I just read this, and I cannot believe what happened. :(<br />So much fourtris, so many choices, so much divergence, so much tris.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|You ever watch those movies where there's like a few different people whose lives are being told about?? Well this is one of those and somehow - someway Destiny puts each one of these people in each other's paths!! At first I was like What!?? What am I reading, wait, who is this?? And then..Ohh, I got it((: And the more I kept reading this tangled little web where all these lives were merging..I just wanted to get to the end and find out what fate had in store for them!! So many lessons here, so very well written- ..very Angsty, but true to heart..Loved and understood the characters ,their feelings and emotions so much so that you ask yourself what you'd do in those situations..very good- 5 stars
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This game needs to have instructions on how to play. I just started tapping as I did not know what to do. I eventually got onto the Internet to look how to play! Now I am getting it but we shall see...
B003G4W49C|4.0|Ender was a book that I could put down, yes I know that sounds like something you heard before. To follow a 4year old boy through his life like we were there. I have always Orson Scott Card and will read more of his newer book's.
0765325950|5.0|Oh dear! I hate it that this series has ended! I have enjoyed reading these books so much that I am now going to start all over again. This eminently appropriate final book capped the series in my opinion. I was intrigued at how gripping the story was; how well it tied in all the threads that have developed across the span of this &#34;world war&#34; story. A somewhat unexpected twist at the end, but one that assisted with what appeared to be an impossible thread to tie off.<br />I hope to see more books by Brandon Sanderson in future, as he imparted a masterly touch to the completion of the series.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|@====8<br /> Good<br />@====8<br />Too kill the time if don't have better options<br />@====8<br />It.s not for young people<br />@====8<br />Buy better games<br />@====8
B009YP9L7U|4.0|The back and forth of the relationship gets a bit old, but overall, it was a good story.  I would try another Mira Kelly novel.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Felt part of the Oasis, save a weekend and read it nonstop :) directly to my top 10 list. Enjoy :)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love candy crush. My mom got me addicted to it. At first you couldn't download it to Kindle which was stupid but know you can. You can play this game at all ages. I would recommend this game to anyone who ask. I LOVE this game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally this game is on kindle. I'm so addicted to candy crush. Only thing I wish is that there 's better choice for people who are not on Facebook. Beside that this is my best game
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Although I've experienced a few glitches here and there, I thoroughly enjoy playing this game for the most part. I love the variety of challenges and themes for each bingo game. I don't understand how to play the slots, but the game does exactly what is designed to do, provide entertainment.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|Very well written and helpful for writers and other artists struggling with the so many things that get in the way of writing and finishing your projects.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally on the Kindle Fire HD, I love this game, I have been waiting,  Thank You...... So, what will be next????
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|Bryson uses the flight of Lindberg to weave through the dynamics of the USA in 1927.  After reading it I still do not fully understand the World's fascination with his solo flight across the Atlantic.  I remember in my childhood going to dowtown WashDc to see the parades in celebration of the astronauts which were dwarfed in comparison to what was awarded to Lucky Lindy.  There just aren't any barriers to be broken anymore worthy of the admiration hosted upon The Lone Eagle? Then there was his embracement of Eugenics and admiration of the Nazis.  This was in the time of an American resurgence of the KKK. It shows that it is a constant challenge for Christians to fully embrace the New Testament ideals of loving your neighbor and not falling into the trap of a false sense of superiority. The life of Babe Ruth, Calvin Coolidge, and Herbert Hoover are also fascinating to read about.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Playing this game is for the most part enjoyable. Some levels make me want to tear my hair out though!
B00E9ZFIMM|4.0|I like it.  have been looking for a simple note app. My only complaint is inability to change the date format.
B000ZNRBK4|4.0|Although I have not used it heavily, it does fit good and does the job. I did feel it was a bit expensive though.
B00ERIUO02|5.0|GREAT album! A good variety of songs from slow, pop, ballads and some rap.  Our family think that this is one of her best albums and absolutely deserves 5 stars.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|This watch is the first automatic that I have owned and it's a really well built and fun to own timepiece. Some have complained about the noise of the weight in the watch or the operational noise, but as an engineer hearing (and seeing) the operation is awesome. I love it. The green face is subtle and not too in-your-face and can be dressed up or down with an 18mm NATO strap. I'll report back if anything changes but for now this watch is impeccable.
B000WZONL0|5.0|Very good movie. Engrossing and informative. Acting is first rate! How wonderful that Wilberforce loved animals as well as people and worked to save both.
B007WEQ3K8|1.0|An assortment of mini games that would bore a small child, like &quot;flip the cards to match them up,&quot; &quot;watch a slideshow of the same few images over and over and say whether one image was in the series,&quot; and, my personal favorite, &quot;add two numbers together.&quot; Which is pretty weak, but what really earns the rating is that it tries to con you into wasting your time with that new-age pop psychology nonsense which claims that playing pointless mini games &quot;exercises&quot; your brain.  Snake oil, ho!
B007WKEM8C|5.0|I love the receptors! Super easy, delicious, and cheap! I would recommend getting it as a gift (or baking the treats as gifts, hahaha)
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|I could not tear myself away from the tv!  Talk about binging....this show is absolutely captivating.  I recommend it highly.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I absolutely love this game its so much fun almost every one of my friends and I have it and that's how much fun it is and more.  its imposable not to love this game so u need to get this game don't think about it just get it
B003O86FMW|3.0|The ending was nothing like the rest of the book. It turned weird. I understand where the author was going but to me it seemed like the last chapter was interesting . Other than that I loved the book. I thought it was a fun read.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|enhanced frequency range, great depth and clarity of sound, no muddled at bass level volume.<br />sound is almost CD quality
006202406X|1.0|I don't usually write reviews, but in my extreme disappointment I just had to write it down.  The problem with this series was that it started out so good!  I mean amazingly good, and the insurgent kind of took it down a notch, and I was so hoping that Allegiant would bring it back up, but it didn't.<br /><br />Divergent: Amazing :)<br />Insurgent: Meh :/<br />Allegiant: Terrible :(
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Also more power ups....for free cool game wish I had more lives feature black blanket blaster boa blow boa uhh rhythm Tim
B00BT70J7M|5.0|A magnificent collection by this superb performer: a must-have to commemorate Verdi's 200th!  Put this in your collection for sure...
B005LMEB8E|5.0|Demi has a way inspring others to live life to the full potentional it can offer. She has faced opticals that others have went through too, but she came out on top and now is telling her story.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|What can one say? Maggie is always perfect and proves herself definitive as this character. Fantastic portrayals by all the leads and supporting cast&#62; Too bad this was so overlooked by the Academy Awards. Own it & love it!
B002C2XXJY|5.0|Demi has a way inspring others to live life to the full potentional it can offer. She has faced opticals that others have went through too, but she came out on top and now is telling her story.
B00AEQYM6S|5.0|Mr. Kaufmann s always superb, but never more so than in this collection of Wagner excerpts.  You can &#34;feel&#34; the drama in every track.........matching his live performances.  Catch him in recital with Renee Fleming at Lyric Opera of Chicago in March of 2014!!  WOW!!
B00AOMR2S2|5.0|I recommend the sound track if you have the movie and loved it. I enjoy broadway music and this is a great additon to my collection.
0525478817|5.0|This book gave me intense FEELS... I found myself reading it on my phone while taking a bath and I started crying so hard I had to put it down so I wouldn't drop my phone in the water
B001DU8T6I|5.0|Demi has a way inspring others to live life to the full potentional it can offer. She has faced opticals that others have went through too, but she came out on top and now is telling her story.
B002UWH8P6|4.0|This was very good. Not quite as good as Stargate SG-1 but equally as adventurous. A wide variety of characters. Some you love and some you want to kick in the pants but all in all that's what makes a great series is the different personalities. Quite a concept being on a space ship traveling through outer space not knowing where it's going or if you will ever be able to return home.
B00A2H9PLG|5.0|The movie offers action packed scences, and excellent special effects. I enjoy and love this movie and will keep watching it over and over again.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Love this game. Wish there wasn't an ad the beginning of each game though. The game itself is fun to play.
0307476073|5.0|I read this online without knowing anything about it.  I just loved the book! Cheryl's writing really moved me throughout the entire read. I highly recommend this for almost anyone.  I liked it so much a purchased a hard copy for my wife to read.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|In my humble opinion, its the worse book in the triology... I should have just stopped at Insurgent and read Fan Fiction or Made up my own ideas, and I think I would have liked that better. I had such high hopes for this series, espicially this book, and it disappointed me BIG TIME!!! Some of what happened, seemed very unrealistic as far as the characters where concerned... And some things that took place, seemed very unnecessary. I get the author may have been trying to do something different or going against the grain for the ending of the series, but ultimately, for me, against the grain proved to be a failure anda disappointment. I LOVED Divergent and Insurgent, but I can not recommend Allegiant. Now, I have to debate watching the movies knowing how its all going to end... Do I want to invest in this franchise anymore? Good luck to those who chose to read this book.
B00F35BV64|3.0|Into Darkness is a little less exciting than the 2009 movie, but the plot holes are fewer. As before, the performances are all great, but this time with the welcome addition of Benedict Cumberbatch, who is always a pleasure to watch.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This awesome game is finally available on my kindle. It's a great game for adults and kids. What I like most about this game is that you have five lives, and when it's over you either choose to accept lives your friends sent, or you can leave the game and do other stuff  then come back to the game when you got the spear time to play.
006202406X|4.0|I have to admit that the book was intriguing. The direction she gave the story came completely out of left field, but it kept me interested. A lot of the events in the book surprised me. Some of the events probably could have been left out.(*cough, cough* Uriah *cough*) The ending was not one of them. I think it fit into the story and I think Ross wanted her readers to feel emotional at the end and she accomplished that goal. So now I am going to get a tub of ice cream and cry myself to sleep.
B00FF8OKJE|1.0|This app started out fun. THEN THE UPDATE HAPPENED. YOU CANNOT GET PAST IT AND BETWEEN MY HUSBAND AND I, WE HAD ALREADY SPENT $100.00. SAVE YOUR HARD EARNED CASH FOR A GAME THAT ACTUALLY WORKS. I AM NOT IMPRESSED AND THERE ARE OTHERS WHO HAVE SPENT MORE AND CANNOT PLAY. SHAME ON YOU FOR STEALING EVERYONE'S MONEY. YOU GOT TOO GREEDY AND NOW YOU HAVE LOST OUT ON FUTURE PROFITS!
B007HACDLK|4.0|Thank you again for another great story, I really enjoyed it. RIP Vince, you will surely be missed. God Bless
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so fun to play. I could sit for hours just playing this game<br />  It is so addictive
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I hate the in app purchasing. It's not necessary, you just have to wait to move on, but it's annoying because the game is crack.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I've read &#34;Ready Player One&#34; three times, now, and listened to the audiobook read by Wil Wheaton twice.  I was born in 1963, and grew up a computer geek, learning to program on an old timeshare system with an acoustic coupler modem and a teletype.  I drooled over the TRS-80 Color Computer, but couldn't afford one.  I used hourly job money to buy myself a TI-99/4a.  I programmed a Commodore 64 at my mom's office on weekends.  I played AD&D with people who are still my closest friends and gaming companions, 30+ years later.<br /><br />&#34;Ready Player One&#34; is an amazing story, one that hit so close to home it was almost painful at times.  I love this book. And so, I think, will anyone who grew up a geek, a nerd, a gamer, or just a lover of pop culture.<br /><br />This book has earned a lifetime position in my top 10 favorite books of all time.
006202406X|1.0|This book is lacking in every way, most significantly in plot. The first two books were fantastic and this was a waste of my time.
B002ZG97LK|5.0|Was lost in a move. This movie was a favorite of my daughters and I found it on amazon so glad.
B00D9RQO56|5.0|have always loved this movie.  such a fun halloween, and holiday season movie.  so glad i finally took the plunge and purchased it!!!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|OK so I must say first that I rarely write reviews but I felt compelled to do this one as it has been on the biggest dissapointments I had had,<br />I read the book yesterday, as yes I'm on of those people  that once it starts I dont fisnish it. the main reason I do read books is because of the fantasy, the escape of realities, and all teh things that we can imagine.<br />I'm a romantic  by nature but I also like to read  fictions specially distopyian one.<br />I loved teh 1st too books and tur to be told I feel in love with Tris & Tobias  because not matter how hard their life was  at that young age they always foght one way or another to find out their ways their true.<br />But I understand the author need to \\"shock\\" us with Tris's death but I think it was not necsary specially the way she died after all they endure. i felt empty and unsatistied after I read the book, I keep t reading hoping there was something else where Tris would come up but nothing.<br />Do not read it. Just read the 1st too book and imagine your own ending. This will leave you witha  sour taste
B00D2CYU2W|3.0|If you're a Michael Douglas fan, watch the movie just to watch an exquisite aging performer give an aged Liberace performance; you'll need sunglasses against his flashing pearly whites.  If you're a devout Liberace fan, don't watch this movie.  Keep your illusions that Liberace purposely set out to create for his fans-- a flamboyant man with an extrodinary gift and don't let you mothers or grandmothers watch this film - some secrets are best kept secret.  I was totally surprised by the candor of this film, e.g., how early movie stars or public figures went to great lengths to enhance themselves, like Marilyn Menroe's plastic surgery revelation.  Liberace was also into plastic surgery and enhancements during his later years. I knew some older male stars went to great lengths, before Viagra, to show themselves as verile.  I can honestly say, my jaw dropped a couple of times in disbelief during this movie at some of the revelations about Liberace; some moments were truly laughable.  Matt Damon's performance as Scott Thorson, (Damon's personal persona), isn't diminished by this role.  In fact, there is an almost like innocense in Damon's performace as Liberace comes to reveal himself to the young Scott Thorson.  You feel the trust between the two, but I didn't get what was loving between the two. Librace was a user of young men.  Behind the Candelabra will probably become a cult film for Liberace.  It's only a matter of time.
B00BCCE3VM|2.0|Let's be quick: Lisiecki does not have an individual pianistic voice. You can get more drama and architecture from Rubinstein, more virtuosity and excitement from Pollini and Argerich, more color from Trifonov, more vintage beauty from Backhaus and the Golden Age gang.That's about 5 generations of pianism that offers more than Lisiecki. This here disc basically amounts to a good student performance. Can not recommend.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|This game has its flaws, but it's the best you'll get for free. It's fairly entertaining. Works okay on my Kindle Fire HD 7&quot;.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I enjoy playing the game it is fun to play and I play with out having to spend any money I level up for times while playing
B009SJ47XA|5.0|Phenomenal cast, great set. Jessica Lange, Sarah Paulson, Lily Raabe, and Zachary Quinto were amazing.  Can't wait to see how Coven turns out!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|because,along with all his boots you know that every book is as good if not better than the last.  GREAT
B001AQR3JY|5.0|We saw the movie before,  then we saw the stage show in Las Vegas....  Unreal how they did all the animals  on stage.  So we wanted to keep The Lion King on DVD to show our grandchildren
B004NYCRL4|4.0|_Frankenstein_ is my favourite book written by Mary Shelley, but that doesn't say much, given that I do not particularly care for her writing.  I bought this book for my daughter, who is required to read it for school, and she has a very similar opinion of the book to mine.  It's a classic.  If you're into that kind of thing, order it; you may like it.  There are many better books, if you're looking for a good read that has stood the test of time.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|We have seen this play  in a Los Vegas  Show,  Then saw 2 different movies.  We love the songs, the band the acting  everythig,  but let me tell you this is the first time we ever saw the phantom , once unmasked , so  so ugly...WOW..Then  at the end bringing out all the old phantoms and original Christine all to sing...  fantastic....
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I was excited to read this book and looked forward to it , however, from the first few chapters it was clear Allegiant was not what I was expecting. The dual POV was disappointing. Veronica Roth obviously wasn't able to capture a distinct \\"male\\" voice, so Tris and Tobias sound exactly the same. The new plot lines and story details were random and seemed arbitrary. I didn't get a sense of completion or closure on the series on any level. This third installment cheapened the whole experience.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|the acting was great and we I love the song  &#34;Memories&#34;,  It makes you think of your own past memories  you almost want to cry thinking of your old memories...
B00C7JG0KG|4.0|This movie was not at all what I expected.  It was better than expected. The background story  and the animation of the creatures was creative and interesting.  The 3D was good. I reccomend this movie for anyone 7 years or older.
B008ZVJE3A|4.0|I enjoyed this for multiple reasons:<br />1.  Good music (regardless if they're not actually playing it or not)<br />2.  Good humor<br />3.  It was free<br /><br />The only downfall is that if you're not used to British accents some of the jokes are hard to hear and pick up on.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I find Hosseini writes beautiful prose that elegantly captures the barest of emotions. This book doesn't flow as easily as his others, but still provides the reader with plenty of interesting characters who tell the story of Afghani people.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|Love the controls, the new maps, and multiplayer online. You'll love this game, it's for any fan of car racing!
B000VWE5OY|1.0|There was considerable damage to the plastic cases, in one corner.<br />but the worst was that I could not get the dvd to play.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|challenging and entertaining. probably spend way more time on it than I should. each level provides more of a challenge than the previous.
B002Y0MQ6A|4.0|This movie was way better than expected. I like these apocalyptic type of movies so I thought I would give it a chance. It was well paced and held the attention of my husband and me. Don't expect World War Z, a much better movie. But this was still fun and I would recommend it.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I`m having a difficult time wrapping my aching heart around the author stating in an interview that she always knew how this series would end. If that end serves no logical purpose then why create it to exist? I will now always wonder whether her true motivation was to become the anti typical dystopian YA novalist. There were other ways to make her series stand the test of time but now she will have created enough of a fan based fallout, henceforth smashing the uplifting potential this final book could have held and erasing the previous two from happy memory. If I ever reread this series again, it will be a small miracle. First I must make peace with the devastating ending and still move past the wishy washy, anti climatic &#34;action&#34; sequences as well as the trippy duel POV and the ignorant, simple minded planning of numerous revolutions. My only reason for the second star is to honor the Tobias and Tris relationship that evolved and reflected so much of real life, even in its short lived imaginary one.
B00132S74A|4.0|Code to Zero is overall an excellent read.  The naivete of Luke and Billie is  \\"a bit much\\" but  forgiven as poetic license.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Love waking to bells, and that I can select which days I want the alarm(s) to go off. The alarm by location feature is also extremely helpful. Nice app.
B00E5N8DGG|5.0|Def Leppard have been my favorite band since 1987's 'Hysteria'. I was seventeen when I first heard 'Animal' on FM radio, and I was hooked - not just on this band - but on guitar-driven rock music in general. I imagine many people discovered Leppard with this landmark album, which has sold a staggering 20 million to date. Producer Robert John \\"Mutt\\" Lange built a sonic amusement park, with literally dozens of guitar layers, and choruses hundreds of voices strong, in each song.  What a daunting task, then, to recreate this monster's sound over 25 years later. Yes, the group has been playing most of 'Hysteria' live since then, because it spawned SEVEN hit singles. But five of these songs have been played rarely, if at all, in a live setting. How do they translate on stage? Well, I wouldn't buy this without having a quality home theater system, as that's the only way to appreciate just how meticulously the band performs these tracks, all in amazing DTS MASTER AUDIO. The Las Vegas residency allowed them to rest between shows, really bringing out the best performance I've seen from them in years. In a live setting, you can usually blow through a catalog of hits without regard to precision, as long as the \\"meat\\" of songs remains. On this occasion, the band put obvious effort into making live 'Hysteria' sound as much like the studio version as possible, and they mostly succeed. There's a glorious fat, bottom end, which is one of the most memorable aspects of the album, thanks to Rick Allen's electronic drum kit and Rick Savage's throbbing bass. The two guitar attack of Phil Collen and Vivian Campbell sounds like twelve, thanks to carefully chosen guitar parts, achieving the maximum wall of melodic sound. Joe Elliott's voice isn't quite what it was 25 years ago, but who would expect it to be? He's still able to mostly bring the vocal power, along with the rest of this band of singers. The choruses sound HUGE! This is a testament to just how good they are live, as I didn't detect much, if any, post-tinkering (overdubs) to the audio tracks. Ded Flatbird, \\"the world's best Def Leppard cover band\\" (because it IS Def Leppard, complete with alter-egos and hilarious made-up names), is featured on two blistering sets, performing stuff you haven't heard the guys perform in years, with tracks from 'On Through the Night', 'High 'n' Dry', 'Slang' and 'Euphoria'. The 1080p video looks great, without too many quick cuts seen in most modern concert films. If you're even just a casual fan, buy this, as it is truly the best live representation of Def Leppard to date.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|fun and challenging! I want more levels!! I was frustrated and then felt dumb once I found the clues. I am glad I played.
B008XKSW7M|3.0|This move has some funny moments.  Good to watch when nothing else is on.  But wouldn't watch a second time.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|***SPOILERS INCLUDED***<br /><br />I love...LOVE...the first two books. Divergent was amazing!! Insurgent, although it wasn't as well loved by many people, was still loved by me. I pre ordered Allegiant on my kindle. Couldn't wait for it. These were some of my favorite books. Decided I'd stay up all night reading it. Fell in love with Tris and Tobias through this series. And then....that?! Why spend the first two books telling from Tris' point of view, knowing we are going to be incredibly attached to her and then kill her? Why have her and Tobias go through SO much stuff, only to kill her? Why kill her at all? It's young adult fiction! We read it for the action and the love stories and the triumphs...not to feel like crap when we get done reading. I get that not everything can be perfect in these stories and not everyone can live, but to kill your main character? I'm incredibly hurt and honestly - I wish I had never read them. I have read Four's short story that is out and have pre-ordered the other 3, but am about to get on my amazon account and see if I can cancel them. I don't care to read any more. I'll never read anything written by Veronica Roth again. I lost all respect because I felt like she did this strictly for shock value.<br /><br />***EDITED TO ADD***<br /><br />Because it appears certain people are taking my 1 star review to be based simply on the ending, that is not the case at all. I didn't like how this seemed to be a repeat of Insurgent, just a different setting. I didn't like how you couldn't tell whose POV the chapter was from unless you looked at the name at the beginning. There are many things I didn't like about the book compared to the first two, which I loved. I was simply focusing on the main aspect that made me hate the book in my original review.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Very interesting with 6 different levels.  Each level has its own set of levels. Good Challenges and good help buttons if you need them. '

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I really don't get emotional over books, but this one gets me literally every time. John Green is a genius.
B007FEFLTO|1.0|I think Follett over wrote about Midway and Pearl Harbor and most of all th Nazi s .He killed some Jews and gays and cripples and it took for ever. A person reading his work knows the stories. The idea of this book and the first in the series is great<br /><br />Q
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|Gladwell articulates in a quite compelling manner how the (perceived) underdog has in notable instances throughout history found a way to transform limitations into distinct advantages. He is a master at using a collection of short stories (chapters) to illustrate this primary thesis from several perspectives and points in time. The book begins by showing how David actually had the advantage over Goliath and used it to defeat him. This is the springboard Gladwell upon which Gladwell layers his other captivating vignettes. A truly excellent read!
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Love this game. But as you advance it's harder and harder to win a game and shadow cards seem less and less. Fix this and I will give 5+ stars. Still love the games.
B00DDZM0GQ|3.0|First off, I'll say that this game is totally addictive and for me it is the game du jour.  I love it. I can't quit.<br /><br />There is no doubt in my mind that this should be one a 5-star game, one of my favorites.<br /><br />That being said, it has a few major flaws.<br /><br />1. Most notably, there are pop-up screens after nearly every cleared level.  I appreciate the warnings about the 'upcoming' or 'magnet'.  But I don't need a few seconds' worth of pause in an otherwise fast-paced game to tell me that my move was \\"Impressive!\\" or \\"Excellent!\\" or \\"Amazing!\\", etc... You get it.  It ruins the pace and strategic train-of-thought.  IT NEEDS A USER-OPTION TO TURN THESE OFF!<br /><br />2. The levels don't save where they should.  And the top save is 30.  I have reached the skill level where I can START at 30.  If I then play to, say, 43 before losing, I have to start back at 30.  UGH! IT NEEDS TO SAVE AT THE LEVEL THE PLAYER HAS REACHED!<br /><br />3. It uses beaucoup battery.  I am on an HTC ONE, which has mad battery life.  This game not only drains the battery rapidly, but it also heats up the phone itself.  In fact, I have played this game with the phone plugged in, and the phone frequently warns me that I am using battery power faster than it can be charged.  PLEASE TWEAK THE GAME SO IT IS EASIER ON THE PROCESSOR!<br /><br />4. It crashes all too often.  It doesn't crash the phone, only the game freezes.  I can use the device otherwise, but can't play the game again until after a device restart.  (Maybe this is a plus, because I get so wrapped up in the game, that I might actually NEED a freeze to snap me out of it so I can get back to my real life.)<br /><br />PLEASE fix these things.  As soon as these things are fixed, I will update my review and change it to 5 stars.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Been having so much fun competing with my sisters!!! They've been trying to break my scores but I just won't let them hahaha!!! It's a real rush rush rush ...
B005GIS1WA|1.0|The title of my review says it all.  It is virtually impossible to find a &#34;kid's&#34; movie now that doesn't have any kind of violence, guns, or sexual innuendos.  I couldn't watch this with my five-year old.  Filmmakers, please get a grip and stop producing this garbage.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So excited that it's now on kindle. Oh yeah!!!!! Many sleepless nights now. I can play for hours. I guess that's why I'm on level 414!!!<br /><br />.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|This game is fun, although the Amazon Appstore version is out of date compared to Google Play, as of a few months ago. This game works on Android 2.3 and 4.2.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game! Between weekly challenges and game improvements like different environments or themes (the residential area Halloween theme is awesome!) it never gets old!
006202406X|1.0|The author tried to do WAY too much in this third book... and everything suffered. I won't go into details about the main characters and the outcome of their relationship, I think that has been covered. Past the first few chapters, the whole book lacked flow, pace and a sense of purpose for me.<br /><br />Example of a flow and pace problem? Some of the plot mechanisms to move the story on get comical at times, but not in a good way. The main characters need a train? Out of nowhere pops a woman character \\"with thick eyebrows and pale skin\\"- she is a train expert who can help. Of course.<br /><br />It read as if the author had a motive of simply wanting to shock, a kind of \\"See what I'm not afraid to do to my characters!\\" feel, and cobbled forced scenes around this. It completely failed for me. Disappointing read.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Okay.  I will admit that this book didn't end how I wanted it to.  But that doesn't make it a bad book.  The book has ups and downs.  Veronica was true to herself and how she wanted the story to end (she can do this because it's her story).  If you can't accept it then get over it!  P.S. This book will rip your heart out.  Make sure you have tissues.
B00E9ZFIMM|4.0|No permissions is what seems to make this pro, and what I like.  It is simple but that can also be a virtue. My only suggestion is to not add sharing(we need no help typing on social media). The csv idea I like.
B0012NVGHU|5.0|This movie was very sweet. I enjoyed the relationship of the guitar player and the girl who he met while playing music on the streets. .She was so very sweet and a talented piano player. He was very passionate about playing his songs he wrote and wanted to make a CD of his music. He became very fond of her. It was because they were enjoying making this CD. They both had past loves and<br />wrote songs of the relationships that seemed lost. I found that with each of them writing out their feelings in the words of the songs they realized that maybe they should try these past relationships again. They chose to go their separate ways instead of trying a new relationship together.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed the app but it ended way too soon.  Hopefully more levels to come or at least updates.
B00BSBUZPK|2.0|The Eagles were part of the soundtrack of mine and my husband's dating time so I bought this thinking it would give me more insight into this band. It did, but not in a good way. Glen Frey came off as a complete jerk. Between he and Don Henley there is tremendous talent but also in evidence are some of the biggest egos I've ever seen. I would have liked a more balanced look at ALL the band members who contributed to their great sound in their own way, whether they wrote the songs or not. Also disappointed that the dvd of the previously unreleased concert material was so short with so few songs on it. I really expected more and felt a little ripped off.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Downloaded the streamer application for my PC and it was a snap to remotely access my desktop PC. Easy to setup.
B005CKPQ7A|5.0|I was hesitant about watching this series initially, but after watching all of Season One I was hooked! This is the ultimate &#34;tangled web&#34; story line, and kept me on the edge of my seat with this season in particular!
B000001F9E|5.0|Thin Lizzy at their prime.  I don't think they made a bad album.  Lots of great rocking tunes here.  Enjoy!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I do not normally watch horror films/series, but cannot stop watching this! This is not your stereotypical zombie series. The post-apocalyptic storyline drew me in, and I have been on the edge of my seat with each episode. There is the expected gore element, which I must admit is brilliantly done. Can't wait to see more!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I was using Mozilla Firefox and it was so slow.  I love how fast and efficient it is. Keep up the good work!
B002XMGGK6|5.0|Great movie. Has a lot of horrifying graphic images and very Violent parts throughout the movie. If you don't mind that , then this movie is perfect for you. For the ladies out there, Has a great body shot without his shirt on (HOT)
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is a fun way to waste a few minutes before heading into work.  I wont pay for extra stuff, but the free stuff is more than enoug.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|It came in good condition and I've watched it several times already. I first saw this movie on tv years ago. it was just as good as I remembered.
B00E9ZFIMM|2.0|I'm glad that I got it for free... But it's nowhere near as good as Google keep... Which is free and does a much better job!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Rush is not recommended for anyone with any spare time, as it will eat up every minute you have. This game is simple in concept, just clear the candies, get the score and move on, but it is so much more than that. They some how suck you in level after level always being just one move short of moving on to the next level. If you want to go far in the game, you have to have facebook friends that play it as well so they can help you move on.<br /><br />This is AWESOME on the Kindle HD with its beautiful screen, we were playing this on an Ipod touch and it just doesn’t compare any more to the Kindle.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone but I feel bad if they no longer pay attention to their life or get divorced due to this game. STAY AWAY :D
B002I9Z8I0|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the series.  looking forward to getting the TV series on DVD. Would recommend this to anyone that is A fan of the original characters.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|****SPOILER ALERT****I am venting and ranting and if you have not read the book this review will spoil you so read at your own risk!!!!<br /><br />So I read the first two books in the series in 2 days over the summer and I was hooked. I would give them 5 stars. Veronica Roth created this world that made sense. When I say that I can see how human nature's own prejudices and need to form exclusive groups and society could lead us to this place where factions exist and you must choose this group and cleave to them and their belief system above all else including family. I get it and I appreciate it. While telling this story she introduces us to all sorts of characters and you know as is the case with most dystopian revolution series most of these people that you love will not be there at the end of the series. That's knowledge that you accept and you read anyway.<br /><br />Veronica accomplished something that is rare in storytelling in general she gave you a supporting cast of characters that were great. They were flawed but they all brought something to the story whether you loved them or hated them. She also gave you a male an female protagonists that you could love equally. Four is emotionally damaged by a crappy upbringing but despite that you can see that he will truly be a great man. Tris is virtually superhuman. She has great instincts, is loyal to a fault, and holds strong to her convictions. She is a great role model for the girls and women reading the books because she gets a little lost sometimes but she knows who she is and even though she is falling in love for the first time she doesn't lose sight of that which most people know is rather easy to do.<br /><br />Here's where the issue with Allegiant begins. Veronica Roth gave us real love story in the middle of this revolutionary tale. She didn't cheapen it with any unnecessary triangles and she made you fall in love with them as they fell in love with each other because they got it. As young as they were they understood what it means to truly love someone. We saw them hurt each other constantly. They lied and betrayed each other several times often under the misguided notion that they were protecting the other person, and sometimes they truly were. Here's the key by the end of it they grew and they realized that you couldn't keep making that same mistake over and over again. At some point you have to trust the person you love enough to be honest with them no matter the cost and they accepted that and made a conscious effort to do things differently by the end.<br /><br />Veronica Roth does all these things right with her story and then with a few keystrokes destroys it all and I'm not even sure for what. As an avid reader of dystopian fiction I understand that the good guys don't always prosper and evil awful almost wins but generally that's with a purpose. When the protagonist is sacrificed on the literary alter you understand why it was significant to the story. Even though it breaks your heart you know that ultimately their death meant something. It had a global impact or at least made a huge dent in the armor of the villains of the piece. One example is not literary but I feel it's relevant, Neo's death in the matrix saved the people of Zion. Even though they will have to do it all over again eventually for that moment in time they have peace.<br /><br />Tris's death had very little significance to the story at large instead it feels like a stunt acted out by the author to make her story unique. Instead it feels clich&eacute;d, she took some of the power away from the strong female lead she created. She made her human when all previous stories made her superhuman and what's wrong with that. So often the female lead is overshadowed by the male and needs saving. She is often a damsel and a hero at the same time but not Tris. While there were times when Four had to rescue her it was never because she was a damsel in distress but a strong person who had done as muchas was in her power to hold out or keep a situation at bay.<br /><br />In the end Tris sacrificed her life for those she loved but that was the predictable ending because Tris has been running head first into danger the entire series. The more powerful ending is this girl who at one point felt so much guilt that she wanted to sacrifice found out she wanted to live and make her life mean something and she does. The more riveting ending is this girl who has overcome so much proves that yes her mind and will are unbreakable even when she's told it's impossible and she lives. That would have meant more to me as a reader. Instead we got the indomitable will but her life was still cut short and was it to prove that even the so called perfect people do evil things. We had already proven that over and over again.<br /><br />In the end I thought Allegiant was beautifully written although I will say that the POV switches were not always clear and sometimes it sounded like the same voice. That could have also been done on purpose since Tris and Four were two halves of a whole. It was a story that moved me and touched my heart. I love the characters and I will miss there world and with a couple of tweaks it would have been a 5 star masterpiece. Don't get me wrong it's not simply Tris's death that ruins the book for me because as I've said I have loved other stories where the main character dies. It's the senseless death. By the time Tris died most things had been resolved. Tris's death did not cause a ripple effect that changed the world or even her corner of it. Most of the changes were about to happen anyway. Her death had no global impact and didn't even matter to her assailant. All Tris's death did was break the heart of her friends, her lover, and her fans. It would have been more impactful to tell the story of a girl whose indomitable will allowed her to overcome everything the bureau through at her. It also would have made the divergent thing more relevant because Tris was truly special. That to me is not a story worth telling. The true test of whether her death was worthwhile is would the overall outcome of the story have been changed in the grand scheme by her living. No. She could have lived and the book pretty much have the same ending. Her death meant nothing beyond the people in her immediate circle. Her death didn't change the world the things she did more of that while she was alive. Her life had more of a global impact in the story than her death ever did. You said a great deal of what I said in my review. This ending felt contrived like it was done for shock value and nothing more.  Instead of telling a story her fans would appreciate she took the easy route and tried to make her YA story so different at the end that she lost touch with who these characters she created really were. That's why I had to give it 2 stars.<br /><br />****I took the advice many gave and after a week of letting this book sink in I must downgrade my rating to 1 star.s in her power to hold out or keep a situation at bay.<br /><br />In the end Tris sacrificed her life for those she loved but that was the predictable ending because Tris has been running head first into danger the entire series.

B00CV5ZPA2|2.0|I have listened to this album multiple times now. I enjoyed some of Kanye's previous songs and albums, so I wanted to check this out. I have listened to it with friends and family in an effort to get an objective opinion. By ~3:00 into track 3, I am a God ft. God, when the highly stressed breathing and blood curdling screaming begins, most people are asking that it be turned off. At 3 and a half minutes into Blood on the Leaves, everyone asked if the song was almost over. When I inform them we're only halfway there, they don't believe me<br /><br />What comes over the speakers when this is played cannot be categorized as music. The sounds you hear are more akin to a recording of a dial-up modem remixed with Kanye speaking negative and offensive statements on top. Before the screaming I mention above on I am a God, Kanye includes lyrics like \\"I am a God, so hurry up with my d*** massage.\\"<br /><br />There is no talent here. There is no music to be heard here. Do not be fooled. This isn't just not mainstream. This is an abomination and Kanye should be embarrassed to be making money off of this. Please, please, please DO NOT GIVE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY TO KANYE! Listen to this for free on Spotify so you know what you're getting into (that's what I did) and if you insist on having this, pirate it. Better yet, stop reading this now, go to datpiff.com and get some free mix-tapes from a variety of hip hop artists with talent. This is worse than the worst bad rap album I have ever heard. Worse in fact than any album I have ever heard. The only use for this I can recommend would be to torture someone while they try to complete a SAW-esque booby trapped haunted house (hence the 2 star rating)<br /><br />As if his humiliating, arrogant and ignorant public statements like \\"I am the voice of a generation\\" weren't enough, Kanye has lost all respect with this. Half of me hopes this fades into obscurity as quickly as it came to be, the other half wants us to not forget the lessonswe learned here so that Kanye doesn't get away with this. Help stop the spread of this filth. Educate your friends and family.

Great value and better picture than my DVD Players WiFi.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Game is alright, just hate the Try limit and the whole Facebook connect thing. Also wish we could get a little more bang for our buck when purchasing Tries. Also sucks that after certain things are unlocked by the work we put in that we still have to purchase those things in order to use them. I mean, c'mon, we already unlocked the assist why do we then have to spend $$ in order to use them. You're not making enuff $$ on the purchasing of lives(Tries)? SHEESH!!

I'd like to have read a bit more about their adult lives, but suppose that's been dealt with in other writings.<br /><br />Ms. Atwood is always brilliant; I'm not a fan of the post-apocalyptic genre, but she does it better than, say, Cormac McCarthy or John Updike.

B00ANA27IU|5.0|Great buildup to a great ending. Vivid imagery truly puts you into the world of 2001. Truly a science fiction classic. Can't wait to watch the movie for the first time since I was a kid.
B00992CF6W|5.0|You can build and maintain your mind. It is worth to pay for it it's pocket edition in your pocket
B000JMKQX0|2.0|Would have preferred a more traditional format for a book of this type, and was thus bothered throughout by strange way facts and events were given to me.  Never did finish this book
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I absolutely loved the \\"Fifty shades of Gray trilogy\\" it was very good.  Definitely one collection on to put on your reading list.  I would recommend any one to read this trilogy.
B000AJIF4E|4.0|Good sound for all types of song but the bass is little lacking.<br />The bass is there but you will be disappointed if you refer the heavy bass.<br />However, it is comfortable headphone to wear for long time, as its sound will not wear you down.
B00CU8OVIM|4.0|His style isn't what I'm use too but I really like the ablum.  He's metaphorical artist with clear points.  No need to think too hard or be like &#34;wtf&#34; that got to do with anything like some other artist.  J Cole gets 4 stars and I will recommend his album to others
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game. It makes you think and challenges your mind. I have recommended this game to everyone I know.
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|If this is your type of movie,  you're going to love it.  It's am awesome movie with great special effects.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I stumbled across this book a few days ago and decided to try it out since the price was fairly low compared to other Kindle books. I started it late one afternoon and had it finished the next morning! I just got sucked right into the story and could not wait to find out more about what was happening in the Silo. I thought the pacing was really well done, started off kind of slow but seemed to get more and more intense as it went on.<br /><br />Really well done! I'm reading the second book now and enjoying it so far as well!
B001GAPC1K|5.0|If this is your type of movie, you're going to like it. It's am awesome movie with great special effects.  Robert Downey Jr. plays the part of the millionaire playboy/genius/iron man very well in my opinion.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Omg this is my all time FAVORITE BOOK!!!! It is such a touching and inspiring book to read and LOVE
B004EPZ07U|4.0|If this is your type of movie, you're going to love it. It's am awesome movie with great special effects.The extended version also gives a little more detail to his childhood,  which was also nice.
B00E9ZFIMM|5.0|This app is the easiest ever for just jotting down a short note like a quick shopping list, address, phone number, catchy phrase on a sign, etc. It doesn't have a bunch of extra features to complicate things... If you need all that, Evernote has it.
B004JN1CW4|4.0|After reading all 3  books it was an ok ending, I just wish there was a little more explanation about the events that took place throughout the story. Other than that it's a good series to read. A lot of action is in this last book.
1476727651|5.0|I highly recommend this to anyone who loves King .  Met and exceded my expectations.  Very happy with my purchase.
B003477DVK|5.0|I watched this movie with my 6yr and 9yr grand daughters. This was an awesome and clean movie. We need more movies like this. I recommend this movie for all ages
B00AEBB8YW|5.0|I had been looking for this movie for a long time.  I finally got Netflix and looked for it but to watch it would cost me to rent it but I didn't want to waste my money.  I went on Amazon and found it for almost what it was going to rent it for.  I love this movie.  It is a feel good movie.
B007EC27QM|4.0|Hi.  I found this calculator the best on Amazon app store. But I could not give you 5 stars as it's missing calculator widget.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I agree with most other reviewers. I had some serious issues with several points in the book. I feel like the death at the end was supposed to be the \\"biggest\\" conflict, and that is why Evelyn and Marcus and the situation in Chicago fizzled out so quickly at the end. It didn't make sense. To me it felt like the author decided that once the protagonist was dead, the book should just end, and end it did. I understand how much of an impact killing of a major character has if it is done right. In this case it felt more like the author just wanted to finish the book with shock value.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so happy that we have this to play. This is why I bought the Kindle to play my favorite games. Now just get Pet Rescue and that would be perfect. TYVM
B006TTC5JK|5.0|Upon watching Harvey I found myself lost in the beautiful story and the extremely believable acting of the cast.  James Stewart should have won an Oscar for this--in my opinion he should've have won every Oscar that he was nominated for, but I digress.  The plot is simple but elegant, and EXTREMELY amusing.  There aren't any super funny moments, but I found myself smiling the entire time and chuckling off and on--the humor is classic and some people may not get it right away.  But that's okay because the film is still a gem.  And the Blu-ray transfer is amazing.  All in all, a darn good movie.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I was not sure what to expect from the book. But I ended up really liking it. It was really good and was very interesting to read.
1594484805|4.0|The book easy to read, like it and had read it two  more times. Would pass it on and recommend it to other people who need some motivation because it works for life to and not only for bussines.
1476727651|5.0|Stephen King is back in writing form with the &#34;sequel&#34; to The Shining.  There was a time in his writing that King seemed to be losing his knack, but the the last couple books are from the King that we love.  While I would not call this a true sequel to The Shining there is enough connection to the first book in the character of Danny Torrence to tie this book to The Shining.  I couldn't put this book down once I started it.  All the characters are well formed and interesting.  I recommend this book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I am so happy that they go  it on the tablet bc it cost less than the real minecraft on pc But thank you Mojang!
006202406X|5.0|Okay, I confess I don't like surprises and read the spoilers in advance. When I read the spoilers, I put the book aside for a day since I knew I would hate it.<br /><br />To my complete surprise, I loved it.  To me, it was a wonderful ending to a terrific series and even within tragedy, the author manages to end the series with a feeling of hope.<br /><br />My favorite part of the whole book was the chapter near the end when Tobias is remembering Tris jumping off the roof first. Awesome short chapter that brought tears to my eyes.<br /><br />I do think it started a little slow but for me that just prolonged the pleasure since I'm sad to see this trilogy end.<br /><br />I understand the low reviews because we all want to think there is a happily ever after out there, but sometimes the happily ever after just isn't exactly how we pictured it.<br /><br />So count me as one who read the summary, was horrified and thought the series was ruined, but gave it a chance and was so glad I did.
B00008PW2D|5.0|Finally completed my collection. Never saw season 5 after 6 yrs of watching &#34;Sex and the City. I'm so excited!
B00005O5CM|5.0|I am an old broad of 55.  I have worked as a legal assistant for almost 20 years.  I love this movie.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|This device would be great to allow much more freedom of viewing from the internet... it is so limited in it's use, I would rather buy an android device with much more options of what I want to view on my television...
B00EQ30RVY|5.0|Let me first of all say, Scott Weiland is dead and gone. That 2011 Howard Stern interview is one of the worst thing I saw, he was vulnerable, unable to defend himself and sounded completely gone! (Am not even getting to the \\"shows\\" we have seen after) So fans please get that CLEAR.<br /><br />I higly appreciate STP's will to move forward. These guys still got it, so Thank You STP !!! Songs here are less predictable and monotonous that on the 2010 previous LP, again that's because Chester has a wider vocal range. You can feel the band has the ability to move in several directions and they probably will. Chester is the perfect fit for STP in terms of voice and in terms of background in my opinion. He was, as well, supposed to be the next Velvet Revolver singer.<br /><br /> Guys support this, this is right, fresh, powerfull and great. This IS STP!!!<br /><br /> Favorite track : Same on the Inside, Cry Cry and Tomorrow.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|This is my first Jack teacher book. Liked the movie and wanted to see the source material. Impressed by the quick reading but still filled with loads of good details. Fun adventure.Will try another.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Makes you stop and think when all is read, how truly intertwined our lives are....even with people we don't even know!  And how we only really know people...if they want us to!
006202406X|2.0|I really enjoyed Divergent. Insurgent less so, but it was still an entertaining book. Allegiant was very disappointing. I was underwhelmed by the \\"big reveal\\" at the end of Insurgent but had hopes that in Allegiant more would be explained and it would make some sort of sense.<br /><br />In Allegiant the POV shifts from Tris and Tobias practically every chapter (and the chapters are short) creating a kind of narrative whiplash that kept me from fully engaging with the story. The reveal of the world outside the walls was disappointing, as were the reasons behind the creation of the factioned society. I'm happy to suspend belief and go along for the ride with a story, but this world was a bit too flimsy for me to want to do that.<br /><br />And yes, the ending did seem a bit unnecessary. It's a shame that the story, and the entire series had to end such on a low note.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Love the show, love the actors, love the setting (time & place)....<br />I could watch over and over again.  Can't wait for the next series.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I watched the movie and compared with the book is just plain empty. Can not wait t read the second one!!!
1781162646|4.0|It's not typical Stephen King (and isn't meant to be).  It's a good book though and a pretty quick read.
140006922X|5.0|easy to read, lots of info that would be good for all to know, especially the more zealous who are more<br />rigid, lacking actual knowledge, and uncritical in their thinking
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game its adorable. fun for any age the update is cute too with the halloween touch keep up the good work
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|I had to watch it twice to understand the plot, but interesting sic if movie.  If you are looking for plausibility for get this movie.  If you want a mind bender that will have you researching questions about the movie on the web this is for you
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is such a fun game and gets to be pretty challenging the further you get into the game.  I have a hard time putting it down.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I've really enjoyed this series, but was disappointed in Allegiant. I've loved watching Tris find her courage and balance it with compassion.  I've loved that she shared that with Four, who seemed to have truly found that balance for himself.  One of my favorite things in the first two books is the premise that bravery and selflessness are so closely related.  One of the best things about their character growth is that they do so much of it together, supporting and encouraging each other.  That doesn't seem to happen much in this particular book - they are so rarely together and most of the action happens apart.  Perhaps that's why it doesn't feel like they really continue to grow and develop.  Even though they're physically closer, they don't seem as close emotionally.<br /><br />It's true that I love happy endings, but the lack of one isn't the reason I didn't love this book.  I was disenchanted with the story before we got to the ending.  The book just didn't draw me in and hold my interest the way the previous ones had.  New concerns were introduced that seemed fascinating and full of promise, but were never explored and resolved. There were some sudden character transformations, and while that does sometimes happen, it doesn't feel right in the context of the story.  It would have been so much more engaging to watch character growth through experiences rather than seeing a light switch effect (or simply being told that it had happened).<br /><br />Trading between points of view isn't necessarily a bad thing, but in this case the voices of the characters were so similar that it was difficult to keep track of who was narrating.  It was distracting to have to flip back to the chapter beginning to figure out who was having the experience.<br /><br />*****SPOILER******<br /><br />I didn't cry when Tris died - I was too baffled. Caleb was finally presented with an opportunity to redeem himself.  He could finally step up and prove to Tris that he wasn't the monster heseemed to be. Furthermore, he could have shown that sacrifice for loved ones, or for humanity in general, isn't a Divergent trait, it's a human trait. He could have exploded the whole GP/GD myth with one truly amazing act of heroism, combined with the serum that would allow that message to be spread. More important than happy endings in a book is resolution, and it seemed that in the midst of tragedy and loss we would be given that resolution. When Tris snatched that opportunity away from him (and us) I realized that she had changed, or perhaps I had misread her all along. What could have been uplifting and inspiring felt tragic and pointless.<br /><br />Perhaps the saddest thing for me is reading the comments of teenage fans who believe that this ending was more \\"realistic\\" than a happy ending would be. I hope they find out for themselves that tragedy sometimes happens, but heroism and love and happiness do too and are every bit as real.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|If you believe the claims it is simply a plug and play device no instructions included or needed except those drafted by a lawyer. They try to join their WiFi Chromecaster device your existing Wi-Fi network devices.  If you have more than one wireless link the simple link now becomes more complex quickly with no information as to security settings, or meaningful descriptions of link problems that continue to occur. You can spend hours trying to get their WiFi to linkage to your existing network.  There is very little to no useful trouble shooting elements. If you do get it up and running for a \\"Chromecast\\" nothing seems to connect allowing to cast anything. A real downer... Much better documentation is needed, a much less buggy linkage to existing local networks, and an ability to actually \\"cast\\" to your TV from a phone or computer without the BSOD (black screen of death).  A Very poorly implemented good idea.

B00CL0J99K|4.0|The Iron Man concept is nowhere near as compelling and as riveting as that of Spiderman and the X-Men in the Marvel universe.  It is essentially nothing more than a rich genius playboy being a rich genius playboy, and given the infinite resources available to him it's hard to feel any pity or sympathy for any hardship or difficulty he may suffer.<br /><br />But Iron Man 3 does work, and it works for many reasons.  First and foremost is Robert Downey, Jr., always charismatic and charming, witty and winnable on screen.  Guy Pearce also performs impressively as Downey's nemesis.  The writing is crisp and clever, and the directing controlled and masterly.  The first half of the movie is far more watchable than the second half of the movie, which like all comic book movies must sooner or later, descends into preposterous hilarity.  Nevertheless, Iron Man 3 is solid entertainment.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|This movie continues the Iron Man series - but it gets a little bit quirky as Tony Stark continues to evolve as Iron Man while facing a new threat. Lots of action throughout the movie.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|If I could give this book zero stars I would.  Not because I'm mad at the author for being 'bold and edgy' with her decision (though, really, Veronica, bold and edgy this was not).  But because she broke one of the cardinal rules of fiction writing, and did it for a very stupid reason.  What happened to Tris was completely meaningless, and then to watch Tobias struggle with the fallout left me in tears.  I rarely cry over anything anymore, but I cried at the end of this, and NOT in a good way.  Both me and my little sister waited MONTHS for this book, and though we weren't expecting happy rainbows and puppies, we did want a reason to keep rooting for Tris through all of her struggles.  Even Mockingjay had resolution!<br /><br />Roth's quick-grab at a 'tragic romance' ending felt heartless and empty, and if I was being brutally honest, a complete waste of my time.  It ruined the entire book for me, and I was really enjoying it (and ready to give a five star review) right up until that point.  I still love Divergent and Insurgent, and will keep them locked away for rereading until a moment when I'm less likely to want to beat my head against a wall every time I see the bookstore display.  But...needless to say, I'll never read another book by Roth, and I'm taking this one back to Barnes & Noble for a refund.  I'm okay with reading books where the above referenced event is  a completely integral part of the plot, but this just made me feel like my emotions had been jerked around for two books, and I was awaiting the awesome climax it seemed was coming, only to watch a truly dynamic romantic lead suffer at hands which cared little for anything resembling the pact made between author and reader.<br /><br />For shame, Veronica, for shame.  You won't be wasting my time again.
B008JFUQZ2|5.0|I rarely go to movies in theaters anymore. There are a lot of reasons, but the one that pertains here is that most movies these days just dont have the spectacle to need that big screen. This is an exception. Having now watched it I do wish I had seen it in a theater. the movie really needs that overwhelming feeling of a theater to do it justice. Oh well.<br />The movie has no surprises. This is not a criticism. It is a fantastically fun movie to watch. Giant impossible robots. Giant impossible monsters. massive destruction. Whats not to love? I actually didnt even notice that it was over 2 hours long. the time seemed to fly by. For the older monster movie fan, prepare to feel a tsunami of nostalgia. For the younger fans be prepared to smile until your face hurts. This is a family movie. I can not imagine anyone who could not be entertained by the mindlessness and chaos.<br />Pacific Rim is on the order of fantasy and fun that 2012 was. No thinking required. you just ride it to the end.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I never anticipated a &#34;children's&#34; book having so much depth and believable cleverness. In a way changed how I view certain aspects of my life in a manner of being more engaged in everything that I do and seeing how self-limiting we can be by not giving everything our all. To go back to the surface of it all, a well thought out and captivating story, could not put it down.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Good ending to am excellent series. I will be thinking about this book for many days to come. I can't really say how I feel about the book without giving away what happens, sorry :)
B00FR3WZKI|2.0|What a disappointment! I had been eagerly awaiting this remix CD ever since I heard it was coming out. I'm old enough that I have purchased each of her albums over the years on VINYL then again on CD. I have been a Donna Summer fan ever since her debut of \\"Love To Love You Baby\\" back in the seventies. I was a DJ for a time and always loved a good remix version as long as it enhanced the original and didn't diminish it. This new remix collection is just awful in my opinion. The three songs that have been rated in the popularity section are just okay, the rest is crap. The thirty second samples you get here on Amazon and iTunes are not enough to make an informed decision, go to 'Spotify' and listen to the full versions before making a purchase. I will always Love Donna, but this was a wasted opportunity.
B00E9ZFIMM|2.0|it only provides very basic text note function. Samsung's stock notepad and many free notepad tools in play store are much more powerful than this one .<br /><br />I don't know why such a basic tool is not free and mark its name as&quot;pro ++&quot; doesn't make any sense at all. What could it be for the non-pro version ?
B00E9ZFIMM|2.0|Notepad Pro ++ is a very basic notepad application with very few features and no instructions or help files. The app is so basic though,  none are really needed. This app feels like it is unfinished and put out for beta testing. I can see no reason to pay for this app in its current condition. You can find similar free apps that have many more features. With that being said, Notepad Pro ++ doesn't appear to have any unwanted permission requirements. The developer is also promising many improvements and new features. At this time though, Notepad Pro ++ just isn't ready to be a paid application.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|For $35, the Google Chromecast  media device is a great bargain.  It seems to have its limitations given the form factor, but otherwise it's night and day between this device and the streaming options that come with (older)blu-ray players and smart TVs.  It helps to have a tablet to run the Chromecast app, but configuring and controlling a Chromecast device is possible with a laptop or desktop computer provided your computer has a wireless adapter.  Searching for Netflix movies and youtube videos is a breeze as you no longer have to use a TV or blu-ray player remote to navigate around.  Video and audio quality are what you'd expect when it comes to streaming and the initial setup is straightforward and simple enough that most people should be able to easily set one of these devices up.  It does have a few faults, namely setup can be clunky when not using the Chromecast APP via a tablet device or smart phone.  Apparently, it's much more difficult to connect a Chromecast device to a wireless  network that isn't broadcasting its SSID or flat out impossible.  The Chromecast player doesn't seem to be able to handle really complex scenes (video playback becomes choppy, audio sync is lost).  Examples of this are scenes from the first (or one of) Walking Dead episode for season 3 where the actors are walking between chain link fences.  This scene would grind to a crawl as my Chromecast player struggled to keep up losing audio sync and pausing momentarily every other second.  One of the last scenes from Evil Dead 2 caused the same behavior as the flashing lights, wild camera movement and props moving all over the screen were too much for this little streaming device to handle.. which is a shame since my LG blu-ray player has never had this issue, but I'm guessing it (the LG) has some dedicated decoding hardware that the Google Chromecast may lack ( I don't know what's \\"under the hood\\" of this device or my LG player).<br /><br />Pros:<br />Low cost<br />Size (it's small enough to hide away behind your TV or AVR)<br />Easy enough setup and video / movie selection<br />Controlled via a tablet, phone, or PC/laptop<br />Doesn't require LOS between whatever device you're using to control it and the Chromecast itself.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Seems to require a tablet/smartphone for the best user experience, ease of setup<br />Will start broadcasting out wirelessly when it loses connection with your router (has to since it has no USB/network ports and no other way to reconfigure it)<br />Seems to lack processing power for complex/busy movie scenes resulting in dropped frames, hitching, loss of audio sync<br />Content sources are a bit limited right now, but this can change quickly as more online streaming sites add Chromecast support<br />Does not include the ability to stream in content from a local DNLA server (think FreeNAS)
B004XISI4A|5.0|It was an amazing book cannot wait for the next one, it was wonderful to see Cersei be humiliated!!!<br />Hurry up
0142004235|4.0|Before you read this book, you should brush up on your knowledge of Genesis. The title refers to the Garden of Eden and the some of the main characters have biblical names like Adam, Caleb, Aron, and Samuel. So, if you aren't familiar with the details of the Cain and Abel story, you will miss the point of some very important allusions in Steinbeck's novel. In fact, you will miss the whole point of the story. So get out your Bible and read, at the very least, Genesis, chapter 4, before you dig into the novel.<br /><br />The plot of this novel is gripping and powerful. I found it hard to break away from my reading, and the book is far too long (600 pages) to be read in one sitting or even in one day. But, even as I was gripped by the story, I found the characters to be unrealistic---either overly heroic and good or unbelievably evil. The narrator calls the villain, Cathy Ames (later, Kate Trask), a monster. And she lives up to this label. It is impossible to find a single character trait in Cathy that might counterbalance just a little the unrelenting malice in this person's heart. On the heroic/good side there are Sam Hamilton, the wise, loving, and courageous progenitor of the large, but poor, Hamilton family, and Lee, the equally wise, loving, and courgeous Chinese servant/advisor/nanny/cook/housekeeper for the wealthy but conflicted Adam Trask.<br /><br />So I guess this novel has the feel of a great big, time-extended soap opera. Once you start reading, the plot grabs hold of you, and you have to keep coming back to it to find out what happens next. Cathy causes havoc everywhere she goes, and your greatest fear is that she is going to cause some great harm to come to one of those great, good heroic people that you have come to admire so much.<br /><br />I don't know if I learned anything from \\"East of Eden,\\" which would be a shame. Such a great big book about such great biblical themes should have something to teach the world. Did I just miss it? Is it all about\\"timshel,\\" a Hebrew word that Lee discovers to be mistranslated into English (p. 299). \\"Timshel\\" appears in the Genesis story of Cain and Abel. After Cain has murdered his brother, God curses him to wander the world, but at the same time brands him with a mark of protection. He sends Cain off into the world with the words \\"thou shalt rule over him [ie, sin]\\" (King James Version). In a later translation, the words come out this way: \\"Do thou rule over him\\" (American Standard Bible). But Lee discovers that the key word \\"timshel\\" really means \\"thou mayest,\\" which gives a whole new meaning to God's words. They are not a prediction (KJV), nor are they an order (ASB). Rather the words are the offer of a choice to Cain: you may rule over sin if you choose to do so.<br /><br />So, this lifts the novel out of soap opera territory. Now it is about a great big theme that affects all the characters in the novel and, by extension, all of humanity. But is it something new? Don't we already know this? Didn't our parents already know this in 1952 when the novel was published? Did Steinbeck break any new ground in \\"East of Eden\\"?
B007OUINLC|5.0|This dramatized portrayal of two of the best known influences on modern day psycho-therapy is well worth the watch - Viggo Mortensen is fantastic as Freud!
B0033H7VI6|5.0|Thank you, Schrade! First off, I have to say that this knife is clearly superior to its newer counterpart, the SCHF10. While the SCHF10 is made of 8Cr13MoV stainless steel, the 1095 high carbon steel of this knife makes it the better option in my book. Besides, the duracoat on the blade provides all the corrosion resistance you'll probably ever need. The .25&#34; thick blade is very solid and sturdy. It should go without saying that this knife is meant to take a beating. You could expect it to easily handle most bushcraft tasks like splitting, batoning, and carving. Some people consider the handle to be a bit wide, but I would say it's about medium thickness. Yes, the blade does come with a factory edge, which isn't too terribly sharp, but one could easily put a razor edge on it without much difficulty. Seriously guys, this thing has secured its place as my go-to survival knife, despite owning many other &#34;survival knives&#34;. It seems that my other knives always fall short in some area, whereas this one always delivers in all departments.<br /><br />Something else to consider is the price. Lately it seems like you can just slap the word &#34;survival&#34; in the title of a knife and the price magically raises by at least 30%. This appears especially true with one series of orange-handle knives endorsed by a certain celebrity. However if you were to compare this knife to higher-end and more expensive knives, you'll see that this one clearly has the better value or &#34;bang for your buck&#34;.<br /><br />The sheath is pretty so-so, but it does have a couple saving graces. The nylon outer is reasonably tough and has a hard plastic interior for the blade. Also, it has a removable nylon pouch on the outside. The pouch isn't very large, but it could definitely hold a field sharpener, ferro rod, some Quick-Tinder, and a small bottle of mineral oil (for the blade) comfortably. The entire sheath is fully compatible with both American and Russian MOLLE straps. (RussianMOLLE straps are a fair bit wider than ours.) I've seen this type of sheath before many times. In fact, almost all fixed blade Smith & Wesson knives have the same sheath configuration. If you want a better sheath, I would say to add a couple Kydex sheets to your order and make a better one.<br /><br />If you want a true survival knife that will last and don't mind a mediocre initial sheath, then this knife is for you.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I put Doctor Sleep near the very top of that great mountain that is King's body of work.  The thing I love most about his stories--and the same thing that makes them so scary--is how he blends horror with simple, unapologetic humanity.  His characters become real, and that's his magic.  The characters in Doctor Sleep: Dan, Abra, John, Billy and the rest, you come to know them and care for them at a level lesser authors can only dream about.  And lest we forget the bad guys: Rose the Hat, the Crow, et al, they have their human moments as well.  Though, of course, they're not really human, are they?<br /><br />It all adds up to reading at its best--total immersion, can't wait to read the next page but hating the fact that all too soon it'll be finished.  Fantastic job, Mr. King.
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|A fantastic and beautiful piece of art made of LEGOS. Do you like Back To The Future saga??, buy it.
B000063DFN|5.0|Bruce does it again in this beautifully crafted masterpiece. The cover art says it all. Its an amazing piece of musical work. His vocals combined with awesome lyrics make this album an excellent listen. The guitar solos come at you swinging and punch you in the face if you get close enough to your speaker:) This is one of my favorite Iron Maiden albums. Must buy!
1612680011|5.0|This book was very detailed and gave me various ideas on how to think outside the box. I definitely recommend this for everyone.
B00AW8VUDG|5.0|I think this is a great CD by Krokus I am a big fan and the CD has been playing in my car everytime I drive it since i got it in the mail from Amazon , Krokus is one of the best rock n roll bands in the world just as AC/DC
034580404X|3.0|So far, I have only read the first book and its starting to get pretty good; I know we have a lot to learn about dear ole Christian!!
0316055433|3.0|This book is simply \\"over-written\\" in the same way that a great band releases a record that is \\"over-produced\\".  The soul of the artist gets buried under all the tinkering and tricks.  I like Donna Tartt but I had the impression I was reading a sort of \\"Greatest Hits of Donna Tartt\\" rather than being told a genuine story.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I've always liked the &#34;Good Wife&#34; but was unable to watch on a regular basis.  Being able to catch up with it on my Prime video has been wonderful.  I started at the beginning and am now about 5 or 6 episodes into season 2.  The story lines are always interesting and the character's so diverse.  Its fun to anticipate what Cary or Calinda are going to do next, and now we have the new guy who is working very hard at making Calinda's life miserable.<br />Over all I think this is a very entertaining TV show and will continue will watching until  I'm caught up on all the  seasons.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|The setting on Long Island is very realistic and the story line flows very well.  The number of characters in the story makes following the story rather difficult at times.
081299471X|1.0|I ordered this book because I had seen the movie and really did not understand it. Sadly the book follows suit.Very hard read. Would not recommend this book.
B00FEHXISA|1.0|I'm sure the movie was very good, but what I hated about the whole thing is not being able to watch it!  Since I do not have a hard-wired internet connection and only portable WiFi, I was not able to watch this movie on our Smart TV.  Money wasted.
B000UZNRS2|5.0|David's skillful writing and story line will keep you focus on his story. Your kids, your wife and yes your dog will miss you because all you will want to do is read this book and try to figure out how Stone and Finn are going to survive and fight again in the next chapter of this book.
B003CH9PTU|3.0|The first few episodes were really good. I thought I was going to absolutely love this show. As we got closer to the end of the first season it started to get silly and not as realistic. I'd recommend watching it if it was on t.v. , but don't spend money on it.
B00000IGGA|5.0|If someone were to ask me &#34;Who's Tom Waits?&#34;, I'd say, &#34;Go listen to Mule Variations and you'll know&#34;.<br /><br />To me, this is the distillation of all his phases, and as an album it's the best of his work.<br /><br />Here, you'll find representations of his barroom balladeer days (&#34;Picture in a Frame&#34;, &#34;Take It with Me&#34;), aural poetry (&#34;What's He Building?&#34;), Primus collaborations (&#34;Big in Japan&#34;), post-Beefheart experimentalism (&#34;Eyeball Kid&#34;, &#34;Filipino Box Spring Hog&#34;), streetcorner gospel (&#34;Come on Up to the House&#34;), hobo plaints (&#34;Pony&#34;, &#34;Cold Water&#34;), down-and-outers (&#34;Hold On&#34;), laments (&#34;Georgia Lee&#34;), and wry wit (&#34;Chocolate Jesus&#34;).<br /><br />In my opinion, this is not only Tom Waits' best record, it's among the very best records in American music, and 20th century Western music.<br /><br />Yeah, it's that good.<br /><br />If you don't dig it at first, give it time, let it get under your skin.<br /><br />I can't recommend it highly enough.  A masterpiece.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|It's ok. Works on my Asus TF300T. Good Option, but only works with youtube? It's easy and fast. Thank You.
B00FEX2ZFG|5.0|This best horror movie I have seen in a long time that didn't end stupid. Keeps you on edge of your seat the whole time!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Where do I begin? I was so very excited about this book coming out! I had read the first two quickly. I couldn't get enough of Tris and Four, then I see the trailer to the movie, and I get even more excited. I usually don't read the reviews to book because I want to go in not knowing what is going to happen. However, I wish that I would have read the reviews before I bought this book. Not only do I feel I need a refund on this book, I highly doubt that because of this book, I will not go see the movie, and wait for it to come out on HBO where I can watch it for free.<br /><br />Veronica, took this series and completely ruined it! She takes the goodness and the pureness of a teenage romance and completely destroys it. And she doesn't do it gently at all. On more than on occasion, they are happy endings, well, in a YA book, I would hope that they would all be happy endings. We read books to escape the reality that we live in. Yes, we do not have this particular type of society, but we do have the heartache and the fights that all couples go through. That doesn't mean we want to read about people (especially the main characters) being killed off!!!<br /><br />The fame and the spot light has gone to Veronica's head. She took a trilogy that was awesome, has a strong heroine, and a strong partner. They have their problems, and they work through them. But, this book needs to be hidden away, and never seen again. I wish that I had the memory serum so I can forget that I read this book.  Don't waste you money or your time on this book. Stop at the second book and call it good!!!
B000B5MI3Q|4.0|One of the true classic divers at an excellent price point. Great retro style from the 60's and a perfect size. No big clunky stupid looking quartz  handcuff. This has a polished ss case and a smooth turning bezel. Great seiko fit/finish as usual. Only downside is the very easy to scratch crystal. I have several of these, the last purchase was from a less than reliable vendor on amazon. The band was a replacement, not original. It did not have the polished seiko tang, and the easiest give away... It was on backwards! I called amazon but no luck dealing with getting this taken care of.
B009UNGYHG|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised at  the fit of this bluetooth.  I wore an older behind the ear model that I really liked for years -- finding them on ebay after they were no longer manufactured.  I finally had to chose another model -- will always stay with Plantronics for their quality - and the decision was difficult.  It does fall off my ear at times because of wearing glasses, but I can exercise vigorously with it in and it does not move.  The down side is that I cannot voice dial with it which is a great inconvenience.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|Fun game, a little advanced for my kiddos yet, but I'm enjoying it. :) however, it loses server connection at least once every time I play, which means anything I planted or harvested doesn't count. Very very annoying.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great twist on the tale of crazy erotic romance between Gideon and Eva! It's definitely a must read if you've read Bared to you.

B004VMUS9G|4.0|Wakes me without annoying me, all I ask from an alarm clock. Easy to set, turn off and change settings. That's all
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I have never felt more let down and mad at an author at the end of a series before. This was a TERRIBLE way to end this series! I honestly wish I had never even picked up Divergent. I doubt I will bother with seeing the movie now. Seriously, if you love the first two books, don't read this one. It will ruin it. There was too much information and action to be crammed into one book. It doesn't thoroughly explain all the new questions raised, and the ending is the worst I have seen in a long time. It makes NO SENSE to kill off Tris. Especially the way it happened. I could have even accepted it better if it was Four. I still would have hated it, but I could have understood it. Her death didn't mean anything. To go through everything she did including defeating truth serum just to be shot is pointless. I know it is cliche' to have a happily ever after, but that is what makes people love a series. As I said, I could have even understood if Four died. To kill off the heroine though, I think Veronica Roth just cost herself a LOT of fans. I, for one, will never read a book of hers again.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Is there ever a time when a book is NOT better than the movie upon which it was based? The Silver Linings Playbook is no different. Pat's story, while initially disturbed, is littered with good humor and a refreshingly candid take on living with a mental illness. I am glad that this story did not have the typical storybook happy ending, I believe that it ended just how it should.
1476727651|5.0|A well written and logical sequel to 'The Shining&#34; which I re-read to prepare for this new tale.<br />All then usual ingredients of a King effort, with great character development and the usual tension which builds steadily as the plot progresses.<br />Well worth the $$ and the time spent reading.
B007WEQ3K8|4.0|I tried it very interesting. It probably would make you remember better after awhile. The only thing I disliked about it was it gave you the percentage on your correct answers but didn't show you which ones were wrong.
B000H305U0|5.0|This kid have a voice from God! He is so amazingly talented! Great range in his voice too. He takes my breath away!
B003P2WO5E|4.0|A very original, interesting story, but could have been 300 pages shorter.<br /><br />Strong, in depth character development.<br /><br />I really enjoyed it.

0316055433|5.0|\\"Composed with the skills of a master, The Goldfinch is a haunted odyssey through present day America and a drama of enthralling force and acuity. It begins with a boy. Theo Decker, a thirteen-year-old New Yorker, miraculously survives an accident that kills his mother. Abandoned by his father, Theo is taken in by the family of a wealthy friend. Bewildered by his strange new home on Park Avenue, disturbed by schoolmates who don't know how to talk to him, and tormented above all by his unbearable longing for his mother, he clings to one thing that reminds him of her: a small, mysteriously captivating painting that ultimately draws Theo into the underworld of art. As an adult, Theo moves silkily between the drawing rooms of the rich and the dusty labyrinth of an antiques store where he works. He is alienated and in love-and at the center of a narrowing, ever more dangerous circle.\\"    I somehow have not read The Secret History yet, but after reading this wonderful (and long) novel, I'll definitely be picking it up. Like most, I was a bit intimidated by The Goldfinch's length originally, and I put off starting it for a couple of days. But as soon as I began to read, I was drawn into Theo's singular story, and his both clear-eyed and not way of narrating. Only 12 pages in, I was already hooked. That's the power of a great writer for you.    There are so many heartbreaking events in this novel, random twists and turns of fate. After all, in the very first few pages, it's just sheer chance that Theo's mother gets sick in the cab, they have to get out, it starts to rain, a businessman gets the last taxi, and they decide to take shelter in the museum. That short section was so beautifully written, especially for one who knows what's going to happen. The sequence afterward the accident was brilliant too, brilliant and dream-like. Really, the entire book is composed of stunning language and beautiful, disturbing snapshots. Characters, places, and events were beautifully described and portrayed. Donna Tartt's writing style is a bit dense and descriptive, but it didn't feel overwritten; it felt amazingly perceptive and smart. Tartt also builds dread amazingly well, in the aftermath of what happens in the museum and later on. There's great foreshadowing in The Goldfinch.    The Goldfinch has been called Dickensian many times, and that's fairly accurate. The writing is not very similar to Dickens (although there is a lot of description), but the overarching story could be, with strange and cruel twists of fate and fortune, and some very unique, twisted characters. What happens to Theo after the museum is quite improbable: he is abandoned by his father and ends up living with his old school friend on Park Avenue, while meanwhile serving as a sort of apprentice to someone who died in the museum right in front of Theo's eyes. And that's the whole similarity to Dickens. The Goldfinch also has a lot of Gothic elements to it.    The central symbol and motif of the whole novel is, of course, the small painting of a captive goldfinch that Theo dazedly steals from the museum. As the story unfolds, it becomes to him a talisman of his lost mother, something tangible to remember her by. After all, it was one of the paintings she loved the most, and as the days go by it becomes harder and harder for Theo to think of a way to return it. The irony is, that it turns out for many years he didn't actually have this painting that became an object of dread for him. I'm being vague on purpose of course.    There were some great descriptions of the city and of other places too, and I really enjoyed reading about Theo's relationship with many of the other people in the novel, particularly Hobie, the friend of the old man who died, and Boris, who he meets in Las Vegas. The Las Vegas section was kind of the most depressing, especially since I can related to the whole New York longing thing (sort of). Boris, however, was a character both humorous and sad at the sametime, and he was quite irresistible. I didn't really like their whole relationship though, and it was awful to see Theo turning away from his old life and using drugs and all of that.    The Goldfinch is so, so enthralling and I absolutely loved both the plot and the writing. I would highly recommend this excellent, smart, literary novel, and I'm very glad that I read it. Even though it's long, it's still definitely worth the time spent on it. There are a lot more things I could say about the book, but the problem is they've already been said by other professional reviewers: here and here. Go check out those reviews; they're amazingly well crafted, although not as well crafted as this marvelous book.    I received a review copy of this book from Little, Brown; thanks so much! It just came out today; go check it out.    [...]

B007SGLZP8|5.0|Easy to read page turner like other grisham books. Will not disappoint! You know you're gonna read it eventually so go ahead and buy it now. It's late- time for bed! What should I read next?
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Yes, the ending was completely unnecessary, but I truly thought the entire book was a disappointment. It really didn't match up to the previous two in the trilogy n both plot and writing. While I won't go into any spoilers for the sake of people reading these reviews, I do have to say I was extremely disappointed after waiting MONTHS to read this finale. Not the book to be amateur hour for Roth. The plot either moved too quickly, was too stale, or too immature. What drove me to fall in love with the other two books were the well-written characters, great plot, and overall sense of originality that she came up with. I felt like Roth wanted to really do a 180 for the last part in a bad way. It didn't have the finesse that made her readers love Divergent and Insurgent. Overall, a disappointment to what potentially could have been a great trilogy.

B005QYKD4I|2.0|I was a huge fan of The Transformers animated series, the original line of metal toys and I even like the new CGI Transformers Prime. Unfortunately, \\"Transformers: Dark of the Moon\\" is one of those movies that I kept hoping it would hurry up and be over. The CGI was really nice, but the acting would appeal more to young children, while the violence is a bit more than that age group should be watching in a casual setting.<br /><br />I was not too happy that Sam would scream at the top of his lungs every five-minutes, either. The whole tough-guy routine and his personal connection with the whole race of transforming robots is paraded around in such abundance that it's almost embarrassing to watch.<br /><br />I recommend \\"Transformers: Dark of the Moon\\" for those who have seen the first two, and are afflicted with the compulsion to watch this one as well, because it's part of \\"the set.\\"
B000GJPL1S|5.0|One of the greatest movies of all time. If you are ready to experience your true self then this is the movie for you
B00BATKPBE|5.0|Richard Dawkins is one of my personal heros. His understanding of science is outstanding, his ability to explain it is remarkable, and his ability, to make sense of complex and subtle topics puts him at the top of the list of science writers. He also can tell a good story in a down to earth way. It was fascinating to hear how he came to this point in \\"An Appetite for Wonder\\".

B003D81NVQ|5.0|This show has great character development. The acting is borderline unbelievable. Cranston communicates SO much without words.  I actually think his dialogue is almost superfluous.

006202406X|3.0|Although I've liked this series form the first one, I was not impressed with this one.<br />I really don't like that the author keep changing point-of-views, especially so late in the series...the first two follow Tris, but this switches form Tris to Tobis with every chapter.<br /><br />!!!!!!!(Spoiler)!!!!<br /><br />I can understand changing after the death of Tris because people would want to know Fours' state of mind and reasons, but we could have gotten recap of the things he did....even finding them out through Tris, which would have been more surprising. But instead we get two side of the same story, half the book was form Fours' view point, which to me just felt like feeler.<br /><br />I've read worse endings to better books, but overall, It was okay.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I enjoyed the first book and marginally suffered through the second book to see if Tobias and Tris would finally get together in a meaningful, substantial way.  And in the third book, it's just more of the same irritating conflict and constant loss.  I can't think of a single happy scene that was actually satisfying.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert...<br /><br />And when she killed off Tris, I was so done with this series.  All that irritating, depressing reading with hopes of a happy ending gone.  There are so many other great series, like Shelly Crane's &#34;Significance&#34; that have action, romance and are inspiring and spirit lifting.  This book is just a downer from beginning to end.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|The Good Wife is a compelling drama with great acting and well written dialogue. Watching the episodes has become a marathon event.
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|There is really very little action in this book but the descriptions are amazing and make it worth reading.  A few times I wasn't sure I'd complete the book but I'm glad I did.
B002DQDV6Y|5.0|I resisted these books when my children were really young. When they turned 10 ish I dove in and had a hard time putting them down. Then the movies came out. I cannot think of a movie that captured the book better. My kids are older now but I still like to watch them very Halloween  - puts me in the &#34;spirit!&#34;
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I have been a huge Divergent fan from the very beginning. Divergent was incredible, and Insurgent was good, in my opinion. I, and many other fans, have waited over a year for Allegiant. I could not wait to start it! I was a little nervous about the double POV- Tris and Fours- and I was right to be. The beginning wasn't too bad, and I was not minding the double POV. However, in the middle of reading it, I could tell this book was not going to be as good as Divergent and Insurgent. Once Tris, Four, and the rest of the gang go beyond the fence, the story seemed to go downhill. So many new characters were introduced, which was interesting, because I didn't know which ones to trust (quite frankly, I didn't trust any of them). V. Roth stuffed so much information in this book with the GDs and the GPs that the story just became confusing. I couldn't wrap my head around the purpose of the attacks and such. It seems to me that V. Roth wanted to make the story so real that she killed off almost all of our favorite characters. I will not say who, since I do not want to post spoilers for people who have not read the book, but the ending is AWFUL. It is upsetting and so heart-wrenching- I cried while reading it.<br />Allegiant was so much different than the past two books. In Allegiant, I think V. Roth tried to take a lot of gambles with this book, and ultimately, they did not pay off.
B0055MBQOM|5.0|After years of trying to set monitors up properly by hand I gave in and picked this device up.  It is easy to use, and the results are better than I can get by hand.  Recently I used it on Linux, and found the available drivers and software in my distribution worked very well.  Possibly better than the X-Rite provided software!
B00E6895M6|5.0|This new band had been in heavy rotation on SiriusXMU all summer (2013), so it's been a long wait for the full album to finally arrive. This is a first-class debut from this trio, who know how to craft '80s-style synth pop with a modern feel. I have a lot of respect for the songwriting, which gets to the point right away, with catchy melodies, strong lyrics and wonderful vocals. &#34;Intelligent pop&#34; is what I'd call it if pressed for a classification, but CHVRCHES mostly charts their own course.<br /><br />I mentioned the influence of the 1980s, but I couldn't say for any certainty who they remind me of... and this is a GOOD thing. Maybe a distant cousin of Missing Persons, but that's not quite accurate either.<br /><br />Convinced that they're going to be HUGE, I've been telling everyone I know about this band. Now that the album has been released, it's obvious I wasn't the only one noticing: &#34;Bones of What You Believe&#34; peaked at #12 on the Billboard Top 200, which is very respectable for a debut album! Watch for a bigger tour coming and definitely catch them LIVE; they have lots of videos on YouTube to give your a bigger picture of what they are all about. I think they have a bright future ahead!
B004MC8CA2|3.0|While I love this app there are some flaws after the last upgrade. The printing on the devotional is way too small and it can't be adjusted. Also I am getting the finished pop up every day despite turning it off every day.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|I am one of the last people on earth to watch this movie.  Great quality and not as depressing as I thought it would be, yet there were a couple of tear jerker parts.
B004VMUS9G|1.0|Garbage, exactly like the Mood alarm clock. Won't shut off most of the time and not really sure if the thing is activated most of the time
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|great way to pass time when just needing to relax and unwind. I wish coins regenerated faster while not playing
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Love the music, the story, the cast. I've watched it several times, both with and without Dustin Hoffman's commentary. Lovely!!!
B000I5X81K|4.0|I bought this as a gift for a friend who is a Josh Groban fan.  I did not listen to it.
006202406X|1.0|The ending made me burst out in tears because it was unnecessary. Was Roth trying make her self look like an literary writer with deep meaning or analogies or something? She managed to ruin my favorite series in one chapter. WARNING if you love the series read till chapter 48 and make up your own ending. Veronica trashes her story after that to reach a greater meaning or some crap. I hope the script writers for the film will give these characters the writing that they deserve which their creator failed to do so. Read Divergent: One Shot Chapter 17 for a BETTER ALTERNATIVE ENDING. I am not a fanfiction person but I  felt like a needed a resolution that was more suited to the characters. I found it by googling alternatives endings Allegiant. I am not so disappointed anymore and will finally quit thinking over this book and how sad and unnecessary the ending was! I now can believe that they did strive for a life together and succeeded. Just a suggestion for the overly frustrated;)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have this silly game on Facebook, IPhone and my kindle. It's quick fun and quite addictive. I highly recommend it.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|The Language of Flowers was a very touching story.  I've worked in the Foster Care system so that aspect of the book drew me in right away.  And I absolutely LOVED Elizabeth, Grant and Mama Ruby.  Unfortunately, I wasn't as \\"attached\\" to Victoria as I probably should have been.  I realize how troubled of a life she had led, but she just seemed like a little jerk for most of the book - as her 10-year-old self, and as an adult.  I feel terrible saying that, but she was dealt a very bad hand in life, but I don't feel like that should have led to her being such an ungrateful human being as an adult.  Especially when it appeared that a few people had gone out of their way throughout her life to try to make her life better.  So, aside from me being a bad person and annoyed often by Victoria, I really did enjoy this story.  I also thought that the constant flower reference would bore me, but it seemed to add a magical twist to the story.<br /><br />(small spoiler) Also, the ending was slightly predictable, and a little too easy.  Almost like she gave up writing.  There should have been SOME conflict.  You can't abandon your boyfriend (who did everything for her), daughter and foster mother and then come back and just \\"decide\\" to be engaged in your life again - especially without any of them making you face the consequences of just checking out.<br /><br />With all that said, I read the book in about 4 days, which with my limited time, is very good.  I would definitely recommend reading this!  It's a good story, even though I expressed some of my minor complaints  =)
B0038BBA4I|4.0|I bought this album at $5 bucks and it was absolutely worth the purchase.<br />The Cave and Roll away your stone are my fav songs!!!

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This book did not disappoint, I could not put it down! Its a definite must buy from author Stephen King.

B0081AZGHS|5.0|This morning as part of my annual October Fright Film Fest I saw what may be director Rob Reiner's best movie, MISERY (1990), with Oscar-winning Kathy Bates as a demented former pediatric nurse suspected of killing babies under her care, and James Caan as an author who gets into a car wreck during a blizzard and is rescued by Bates.<br /><br />Turns out Bates was instantly available on this remote Colorado road because she'd been secretly stalking Caan, her \\"favorite author.\\" The story gets really terrifying near the end, but not before Bates inflicts much psychological torture on her prisoner and forces him to write another novel starring her beloved \\"Misery.\\"<br /><br />It's from Stephen King's book, scripted by William Goldman (he wrote BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID, THE STEPFORD WIVES, THE PRINCESS BRIDE, HEAT, MAVERICK and CHAPLIN, among other fine pictures).<br /><br />Also with Richard Farnsworth as Buster, the small town sheriff who figures out where Caan has disappeared to, Frances Sternhagen as Buster's wife Virginia, who \\"spices up\\" their marriage with sarcastic quips, Lauren Bacall in a couple of cameos as Caan's literary agent, and the adorable Misery the Pig, a scene-stealer if ever there was one!<br /><br />Rated 7.8 at IMDb.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Have a blast playing this game.  My daughter and I fight over who gets to play.  Finally downloaded onto her device
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's been a while since my last post on Amazon begging them to get this app. I was so happy to open my kindle and find the app on the front page. I almost lost it. It's so much better playing on a tablet then a little phone.
006202406X|1.0|I was practically giddy when I picked this up. I was a fan of Veronica's before Divergent was widespread. Now, I'm just disappointed. I feel totally betrayed. As one reviewer said, Tris and Tobias belonged to us. To have her killed off, was wrong on so many levels. Tris deserved better than that, as did we. She deserved a happy ending. While she died a hero, she deserved to live in peace as one too.<br /><br />I've never been so disappointed in an author in my life. Not only was the book kind of boring, but it lacked the spark and action that the other two in the trilogy had. I felt like she was really grasping for words instead of writing from the heart. In the future, Veronica, if you're going to write a book, please don't rush the release. Make sure the book is what it should be, and not just a rambling of words. This isn't 11th grade English and if you want to be a serious writer, you should push for a better novel next time.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Setup was very easy, done in five minutes.<br />Youtube and netflicks both work very well. Have controlled those apps from a Windows 8 PC, Ipad and Iphone 4 with no issues.<br />Looking forward to more apps being supported.<br /><br />My only gripe is with videos dropped into a chrome browser and cast from there. Works fine initially but often casting will fail after 20 / 30 minutes. Return to the browser and no devices are detectible for casting. Sometimes closing the browser are reopening it fixes it, some times it doesn't. Happens often enough that casting from the chrome browser is really not usable,.<br /><br />Have not been able to find any information on this issue on the Chromecast support pages.
B00E9P959O|5.0|This is my first ever Amazon review.  I was inspired by this sensational remix of Rush' Vapor Trails.  The raw emotion of the original recording is brought to life by this brilliantly produced record.  This may be the best material ever produced by Rush.<br /><br />Ceiling Unlimited and Earthshine are absolutely fabulous pieces of music.  If you are a long-time Rush fan, and have felt that Vapor Trails was a dark spot in a long career of magically written, performed, and produced music, you must buy this remix.  Not only does this recording nullify the dark period.  It creates a high point in Rush' career that may never be surpassed.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Not a bad read. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a goof story, and an easy one to follow.
B00004NRWH|5.0|Not sure how I missed this early music from one of my favorite bands but I'm glad I found this. More great music from a great band!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Although, initially I had difficulty getting to know and understand the characters of this story as they were first presented, once I became accustomed to the author's writing style, I was completely drawn in to this deep and intriguing story. The story weaves through the everyday lives of several people who live in, or are part of, a small community in Australia.  They are all connected to each other, in some way, through the Catholic school that they either attended as children, work for or volunteer in as adults, or currently have children attending.  The author developed her characters so well, that the reader ultimately begins to know each one intimately and in a way, becomes part of their inner thinking processes, thereby, understanding the motives for the things each character says, and does. The story's plot revolves around a letter written by Cecelia's husband that was to be opened in the event of his death.  She accidentally finds the letter while looking for information pertaining to the Berlin Wall for her daughter. When she asks her husband about the letter, it is clear that he does not want her to read it; however, because of that, she decides to read it anyway...<br /><br />A pivotal character in the story is the PE teacher, who once was a student at the school himself, during which, in his high school years, was romantically involved with two girls; one, now a married, but separated woman, and the other, was murdered by an unknown assailant during the time he was dating her. The case was never solved, prior to this time.  All of the characters are intrinsically linked, in some way, to this event.  A symbolic reference to the Berlin Wall is mentioned throughout the book, which, in itself, seems to be an underlying theme and references the divisions that many of the characters have to others, and/or to many of the events that have occurred in their lives. The concept of the school links them together as a whole, but the events of their lives becomes the &#34;wall&#34; that separates them.<br /><br />The book is well written, exciting, well developed, and most definitely keeps the reader interested and intrigued throughout. This book is highly recommended and is currently on the NYTimes best seller list.
B006BFK5DK|4.0|It's nice to hear new music from EWF and I'm so glad they didn't try to do any of the new Electronica music.
B008JFUQZ2|4.0|Ok, so this movie had a B quality action feel but I did enjoy it. The Huge Robots , the weird Huge Monsters are what you are waiting to see through out the movie. Such an original concept, especially these days where they just repeat same old movies. Concept is great but characters/actors are not memorable except Idris Elba but these movies only action, robots and monsters are suppose to be memorable. Great for the family. As a mom of 4 boys it's hard to find action movies that we can see as a fam without me worrying if there is a nudie scene. Cheesy but great for family and action packed.
B0069JBKHI|1.0|Terrible customer service and the product does not meet even half of what it promises, please do not buy this product
B00C9QQBA6|5.0|In the blink of an eye...<br /><br />I know when I picked up Aurora Conspiracy: Crash landing, that it was a short book and part of the series. I started reading, turning pages as the story zipped ahead and then I was turning the last page. Like a chocolate brownie covered with ice cream, I got to the bottom of the bowl and was left to ponder where all of that good stuff had gone so quickly.<br /><br />The premise is an interesting one. A futuristic alien, with human qualities, has a mishap while time traveling and ends up stuck in the late 1800's. The Author set the stage to make these two interesting worlds collide: time traveling advanced species and a generation of Americans that were self sufficient, resourceful, tough and looking at a new century just around the corner. The story was face paced and entertaining, although the characters were a little naive and maybe to open to an alien in their midst (I have seen things pop out of peoples stomachs, so I would be somewhat reserved when talking to someone who fell from the sky).<br /><br />The book is only 8 chapters, so there was not a lot of material to develop characters and back story, but I am going to assume that occurs over the length of the series. The glimpses we see of the characters makeup and history in the book is credible and interesting. It was slightly rushed, but the conclusion was sound and left me wanting to read further into the series.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is the real deal!! Connects to Facebook without any hassle. I have been waiting for this app since I purchased my kindle fire hd. Works great..no problems!!

B00DZJ82TY|5.0|Finally after all these years I'm so happy to have \\"moondance\\" remastered. The sound is great no \\"Loudness war\\" going on here and sound wise the songs fit in well when shuffled with the remasters from \\"Still on Top-The Greatest Hits\\" that to my ears are well done but a little shrill at times, not the case here. As far as the outtakes on disc two go they are more interesting than most of the junk thrown on expanded editions and I love \\"I Shall Sing\\" it almost makes me get up and wanna dance... almost.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Is don't know what to say it's just because its so awesome,addicting,and cool and it is the #1 best deer hunter game so far.
B00499NHLC|4.0|Cumberbatch interprets Holmes' character with inspired intuition.  He is fabulous in the role, as are all the surrounding characters as well.  Plots a bit hard to follow, but that adds to the sense of being dazzled by Sherlock's genius.  Sets and directing really good.  A must see.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I made the purchase, They sent the unit, it would not charge. After several attempts it finally took a charge once then stopped charging altogeater. Contacted Amazon they sent another, this one would not connect with Amazon, I called Amazon went thru two hours on the phone with them, no fix. They sent out another  had it the next day, same problem, will not connect, same amount of time on the phone with the same result. So to sum it up I was in possesion of three Kindles and none of them worked. I would say they are aware of the problems and that is why they have the new feature of instant live help on the screen. My best advice to anyone thinking about  buying one is SHOP ON these are not any good at this time. I had to give it one star only becauser they make you to fill out the review. I do not want to sound like a complainer but what I wrote was the honest truth.<br /><br />Service is Great The Product just isn't
B00CHVJI08|5.0|I love this movie.  The whole family watch it together over and over.  Happy to add this movie to our media library.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy crush is awesome!!!! Go through different levels and stuff like that. The only problem is the lives if you mess up it takes 30 mins to play again
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Fun game, challenging and graphics are great too. You don't earn coins but you do earn gems. I don't have anything negative to say about it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have checked almost everyday, patiently waiting for you to bring this app available. Now all I need is pet rescue and I will be happy. Thanks.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Such a shame that Amazon continually lags behind the google play store. I guess i will stick to google for my paid apps and only use Amazon for faotd. I would rate five stars if this was the most current version of the game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was waiting for this application... and now I can stop ... love it so bad.<br />I recommended this app to every one.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|didn't understand why everyone was obsessed with this game. now I understand. just hate the &quot;time outs &quot;. would give it 5 stars if it allowed unlimited play without trying to get me to purchase a set of lives.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Loved all three books. Better then fifty shades of grey. Strong female lead is a nice change. Can't wait for the next in the series!!!
006202406X|1.0|I am glad I just read Divergent in August, then flew through Insurgent and only had to wait until October to be COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY HEARTBROKEN by Veronica Roth. I finished Allegiant in one day, from the time I got home from work until about an hour before bed. I read through it quickly, not minding the different view points (I like reading from Tobias's point of view and it was interesting to see them as a couple from two different viewpoints)...but WHY?<br /><br />Why have such a dynamic storyline that felt a little forced and quite frankly, redundant after reading the first two? These characters (to me they are people) already had to fight the battle of their lives, sometimes more than once, to get outside the city..and now you throw them in yet another crazy situation?<br /><br />*SPOILERS* Why spend two and three quarter books getting me to love Tris and who she is..only to have her make the ultimate sacrifice and die? Why didn't Caleb go push the button?! This is not the ending I wanted! I wanted she and Four to have a quiet, regular life in the Epilogue.<br /><br />I'm done with this series. I have no desire to see the movie whatsoever and quite frankly, am returning the book this afternoon. Veronica Roth broke my heart..and for what? I will never understand why she did this to us, the readers. I was preaching the awesomeness of the series to all my friends, several of whom read my copy of Divergent, and now I will tell them NOT to read it. What's the point?
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so glad they finally got a kindle version! Play this all the time on facebook, now on kindle too. Appreciate the complexity of the games as the levels go higher.
B00D2I8E46|1.0|I am a huge Elvis Costello fan and have followed him through all of his many incarnations. I believe his country cover album Almost Blue, showed his early genius in bridging musical  genres with his own special style and grace.  His subsequent work on The Juliet Letters, Painted from Memory, and many film scores have been testament to Costello's ability to produce high quality unique works of music in many different musical styles. I feel this collaboration represents a complete brake from the Artist's normal standards of excellence and \\"quality control\\". On  the album Mighty like a Rose, the song, How to be Dumb, asks, \\"Don't you know how to be dumb?\\" This album seems to have answered that for Costello. As only one other review as pointed out most of the songs on the album are a collage of melody and lyrics from previous Costello songs. At one point, before I listened to this album, I thought the words in these original songs meant something to the artist himself. In Wise up Ghost, they are simply there to be repetitive filler. Sadly, any true, really strong fans of Costello's work can't help but hear tracks like Tripwire, and think \\" What the H did he do to satellite!\\" It is an amazingly beautiful song off the Spike, album.  The song Refused to Be Saved, is a spin off of, The Invasion hit Parade, From, Mighty Like a Rose. It again makes a true fan remember how much better the original work was and reminds me of a quite \\"Root like\\" funky song\\" on the Spike album, Chewing Gum. If Costello was doing something that, \\"funk, hip-hop-pop\\" alone, what, if anything, has he gained from his \\"collaboration\\" with the Roots? In my humble opinion, nothing at all. To quite a much wiser Costello on a much better album. \\"It's hard to tell the difference, between a king and a jack, between a poet and a hack.\\"
B000JJS8TM|2.0|The cd is wonderful as is all the Beatles music. The audio dvd is just that, AUDIO. I wasn't paying attention obviously and bought this thinking I was buying the documentary film. All this is, is a cd with a picture of the album that shows on the tv or computer when you play it. By all means buy the cd but buy the documentary film separately, know what you're getting....
B00EDPFJA4|4.0|Was not happy that a white cardboard slleve was sent.  I prefer the actual CD cover  this was a birthday gift for my daughter and she likes to see Drake not a white sleeve.

B0064W652A|5.0|Reads like a movie, in fact this story would make for an AWESOME animated movie. Someone tell the folks at DC that the Hush storyline is perfect source material.
B004CFBMRY|5.0|Loved this book. Very well written and so informative! Who would think reading about running could be so interesting? So interesting I've read it 3 times!!!
B00D8HNQZI|5.0|If your a fan. This is kick awesome. Great design and came with cd as well.
B00915G6MG|5.0|This show just gets better and better.  The writers bring out the personality depths of each character brilliantly.  Ziva and Tony continue to tease the viewer with possible turns in their on-going friendship.  However, I would like to see more of a relationship develop between Abby and her newly found brother and Mc Gee and the cute little blonde gamer-girl.
B00884GR0W|3.0|While I appreciate the developer actually disclosing that this current update now contains in-app purchasing, it is due to this specific addition that I cannot choose in good conscience to play this game, continue to support the developer, nor recommend this title to others.<br /><br />There is a psychological element to the usage of in-app purchasing that, to me, is highly unethical. Unfortunately, there is a reason that this concept generates vast revenues for the developers who implement it, which I feel says more about them than anything else, and should be taken as a warning by all potential consumers.<br /><br />I initially received this game when it was offered by Amazon as their &quot;Free App of the Day&quot;. As I found more time to explore the features of &quot;Block Story&quot;, I felt that it deserved more of my time to thoroughly review. It wasn't long after I developed more of an interest in this title that this update with the in-app purchasing surfaced. As a result of this inclusion, I feel that I have no other choice than to uninstall the game and discontinue following its development.<br /><br />As there are many dedicated, hard working individuals out there that are doing their best to create something worthwhile to share with you and I for an appropriate fee (if not &quot;totally&quot; free), it's those men and women who I feel deserve our support. They are the ones who don't include in-app purchasing or the gratuitous and unnecessary flood of in-app/game advertising of everything else they have to possibly sell you.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|I was a little hesitant about seeing where this show would go now that Castle and Beckett are a &#34;Couple&#34;!<br />But I love the &#34;a little goes a long way&#34; treatment of the love scenes.  It is sensitive, funny and charming with a lot of twists and turns to keep the viewer's interest.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I LOVE this book! I couldnt stop reading it! I thought that the first one was awesome, but that the books were going to get worse down the line like alot of other series do, but it got better!!!
B00FG5E03W|2.0|Blatantly stole almost the entire plot and did not credit Vonnegut. Not only did it border on plagiarism, but it was painfully slow as well. Save yourself 2.5 hours and do something else.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so happy I can finally play Candy crush on my kindle.  I just wish I could get all my extra moves from friends.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|One of King's best books...great story that keeps your attention and makes you never want to put it down.  Characters are iconic complicated, full of life King characters!  Recommend even if you aren't a Stephen King fan and even if you never read the Shining...but if you did read the Shining makes it that much better!  Was not disappointed.
B00555X8OA|5.0|The author is a Nobel Prize Winner<br />Clear and easy to understand content<br />brief and concrete examples<br />an excellent book for all fields

B007FG9LIE|4.0|I did not believe he could bring all of the seemingly disconnected pieces together. 2/3 of the way through the book I was set up for a stupid ending. Then the author shocked me by pulling it all together in a way I did not see coming. The writing was not great, he obsessed at times but the overall story was fun and at my age I love being surprised.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is my favorite app hands down! I was so excited to see it available on Kindle Fire. Be careful, it's addictive and so much fun. =D
B00FGM0IEU|5.0|My family and I saw this incredible and amazing masterpiece at the theater last night.  We were all blown away with this awesome tale that unfolded like a hit song.  Actually many, many hit songs, and we are thinking about going back again tonight to see it once more before this limited run ends here.  Meanwhile we are all praying it will be released for public sale in DVD form.  This is a real treasure and I told my daughter last night that if I had not seen it, at her kind invitation, my life would have been incomplete.  If you can't get out to see it - DON'T WAIT - by all means Rent It Here On Amazon.
B007SGM084|5.0|It's a good book although it's a bit raunchy. It keeps me interested and I'm going to read the book again for the second time.

B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I just upgraded my older system from a q9550 to this and the difference has been night and day. The old 9550 was running at 4GHz with 4GB of 800MHz ram but after upgrading and overclocking this 3570k I was able to get 4.7GHz out of it with just 1.33 on the vcore. Temps max out at 70C in Intel Burn Test. My system consists of an Asus P8Z77-V Pro motherboard, an EVGA GTX 580 FTW Hydrocopper 2, ram is Crucial Ballistic Sport XT 16 GB (2x8GB) 1600MHz CL9, CPU waterblock is a D-Tek FuZioN v2 w/ MCP655 pump, and a Black Ice GTX Xtreme 480 radiator (No res, just a tline).*  Past 4.7 it needs a lot more core voltage and the temps get a little out of hand, not to mention its pretty unstable above 4.8. That just seems to be my proc's wall. I'm happy with 4.7 and I bet I can get the temps down farther by tweaking the voltages a bit.<br /><br />Even at stock speeds it was taking every game I threw at it with ease, something my old q9550 just couldn't handle even when overclocked. Best of all I saw a pretty sizable reduction in power usage going from the 95W TDP to 77W TDP CPU. The temperatures are a bit higher than my old C2Q but that's alright and the Ivy Bridge can handle the extra heat just fine. I was worried I would be disappointed unless I went with the i7 but I'm glad I didn't. I haven't found a single game that's able to completely max out all 4 cores of this processor so the extra grunt of the i7 would have just been wasted. That will probably change once I upgrade my GTX 580 since that is the limiting factor in my rig now. Overall this processor is well worth the money. Great value for the performance you get. I wasn't sure whether I should get this Ivy Bridge or go with the newer 4670k Haswell to future proof but I figure by the time I have to upgrade this CPU again there will be yet another socket out from Intel so its not a big deal. The 4670k offers a marginal performance increase while having a lower overclocking ability. For me that was the deciding factor.<br /><br />* sidebar:  Never had a leak in all my years of running a watercooling setup btw. As long as you pay attention and lock everything down as well as properly leak test before you install and get up and running there should be no problems.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|so excited this game is now on the kindle.  best game ever!!  thanks for finally getting this app!  play everyday!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Once you start, it's really hard to stop.  I wish I'd started playing sooner!  Now I know what everyone's been talking about.
B007RRFUHM|5.0|I happened to see her on &#34;last call with Carson Daly&#34; where she performed two of her songs and was immediately hooked. I love this artist now, her vocal range is impressive. Overall verdict: worth it!
B000RLH2VM|5.0|PAY ATTENTION!  In this movie, every detail is important,  Excellent story, directing and, of course, acting. De Niro is as good as he gets and the other characters are equal to the challenge . . .
B0055PGUYU|5.0|A very interesting read, highly recommend to anyone interested in evoking change in their lives. Once started, a hard book to put down.
B009B08LJ2|5.0|I really enjoy the new Dark Knight style batman, it seems like he is more of a real person than the &#34;superman like&#34; other superheroes, this is one of my favorite movies so I had to have it for my kindle
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I was a huge fan of the first two books.  The third book was just another rebellion and government conspiracy, but this time with no real purpose.  The new characters were under developed and unlikable.  Tris's relationship with Tobias was also more of the same petty issues as the first two books.  I hate to say it was boring because I loved this series, but that is exactly was the book was.  Then Veronica goes and kills a piece of our hearts with Tris!!!  The problem is that Tris's self-sacrifice was NOT epic or worth it in my opinion.  There was no war and the whole divergent or GP thing she had going on was lost.  There should have been more of a development on that, instead of focusing on her mother's past so much.  It is a sad and disappointing end to what could of been a fantastic series!!!!!
B00FEJIVRQ|4.0|This movie continues the franchise in fine fashion except for the true reveal. I'm severely disappointed at the revelation that the Mandarin is an actor playing a part. Those of us who know the true history of the character are dismayed that he is relegated to this demeaning status, he deserves much more. Other than this reveal the movie is great.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've heard many friends talk about this game and now I understand the addiction. It's a must try game. So give it a try
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Wow this I a great app. I love this app. Great alarms sounds for this app. You will love it. And for 99 cents th oh can't as an for more!
B007BVMVDU|5.0|This show is so amazingly well done (kudos to HBO) They make sure that they try to stay true to the books and not condense too much, there are some parts that are left out, but they are minor, and honestly, the first episode of season 1 made me want to buy the books, needless to say I am ahead of the show now and anxiously awaiting the next book from GRRM.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Awesome, addicting game. Love it, it's fast paced except when you have no m o 're lives...lol! Now I can compete with my kids...lol!
B008N1V11U|5.0|I brought the Kindle Fire for my son, and we also have an Xbox 360 at home and the graphics on his Kindle in this game look almost as good as the regular gaming system.  He loves the game, and I didn't feel like I wasted money on the app.  Definitely a good buy
B00BD99JMW|3.0|After reading the first two books and knowing they would most likely travel outside the city, I was so excited to read the third book, because sky was the limit. There was such HUGE potential for this book, but it fell flat on it's face. I don't know if the author was too stressed to write this book, and just couldn't hack it, but I think she should write a second allegiant 10 years from now when there is less pressure.  I felt the whole book was forced, the character development was fairly nonexistent, and the new compound the same old thing.  It just wasn't all that interesting and I found a lot of the facts unbelievable.  Two hundred years and no other countries invaded the weak USA? Two hundred years and only the east coast and central states were inhabited?  The west was &#34;wild&#34;?  I just don't believe it. If there was an apocalypse the first place I'd go is to a temperate climate so you can grow food all year long.  Moving along, after &#34;the very bad thing&#34; happened, I couldn't even finish the book. I wasn't thrilled with it to that point and that was the straw that broke the camels back.  Divergent is one of my favorite books ever.  Allegiant is one of my unfavorite books ever.  This is a case of choose your own adventure, read the first two, and then make up your own ending, you&#34;ll be happier.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This is a good story, and it is worth reading I think.  But it is definitly attuned to the teenage reader, and won't cause any great thought or speculation in anybody.
B00015YVD6|5.0|What can I say?  Spash is a classic!!  Tom Hanks is fabulous.  The whole cast is wonderful!!  Highly recommend for all ages!!
B000OYC3J8|4.0|This is not the best White Stripes album out there, but it fits in nicely with there porfolio of albums.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I searched forever for this game to be available on Kindle Fire. Now I can be frustrated on a bigger screen lol.
B001NLKT60|5.0|This entire series is great, none of the books are let downs, and you just want it to go on and on and on.  The toughest part about this series is trying to find a book after you done reading it, because nothing quite lives up to it...except maybe the Game of Thrones.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|EBay app is great, however my only problem is that you can not use the same features as the eBay site when listing. I want to create listing templates and use pictures, borders, change the text font and size etc. But as of now these options are not available for the app
B003O86FMW|4.0|I read this entire series, and it was good enough to keep me interested, but it is definitly attuned to the teenage readers.  Still its an intersting story, and like I said, it will keep you interested.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Stop hating on the entire series, the author, and this book! It was one of the best books I've ever read. I cried. I laughed. There were a ton of plot twists and I loved everyone of them. You know how hard it is to write a book? Of course there's going to be less action! It's the final book! What? Do you want an entire new enemy to come out of no where and everyone survives? That would be sooooooo boring. The end is something you don't see often. It takes courage as an author to do it. Disregard all the haters who don't get their way. This book was just amazing. So much suspense. Page turner to the very end. I will reread this many times. The author has so much talent and I look forward to her future books. No matter what. Unfaithful are what you haters are.
B001CZJKS0|4.0|This is a must have collection for any horror movie fan, these older movie don't even hold a candle to the newer scary movies, but they are still fun to watch.
B00BNWWVFG|4.0|The movie had me intrigued right until the end. The story line is in depth and detailed. A very enjoyable thriller. There is a clip of Rooney Mara full nude riding Channing Tatum. All the audience needs to know is that they are able to have sex on this new medication. There is no sex scene per se, just that shot of her full frontal. Honestly unnecessary. It did not fit with the flow.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I love all of his books, this is a great one, the one before it was great, and the one after it is great.  I highly recommend all of his books.
006202406X|1.0|The first two books were great. To end the series this way was wrong. I think a mistake especially when making them into movies who'd want to go see them when it  ends like this? MOST DISAPPOINTING BOOK EVER WRITTEN!!!
B001TD1XWG|3.0|Lil Wayne is not a Rock and Roll singer, he is a rapper and he should stick to it.  Though there is plenty of good songs and catchy beats.
B002SRQ214|5.0|I really love this CPU way better then the phenom i had before it wasn't the black edition great processor.
B00192IV0O|3.0|The Black Eyed Peas, have been getting stranger and stranger, this isn't their best album by far, and hopefully they go back to what made them good years ago
B00386EZJU|5.0|I have watched this with grandson MANY times and love the music. It really is outstanding. Sounds kind of Celtic
B0009XNUK0|4.0|Michael Jackson, may have been controversial and extremely strange, but his music will be around and be played forever, and this is a good collection to sum it up.
B003Z0BWR2|5.0|I agree with Stephanie Meyer on her review that this world that Cassandra has created is a world I love to be in.<br />I give this book 5 stars because I just love everything about it.  The fantasy, action, chemistry and passion all rolled into one - you cannot help yourself to fall in love with the characters..<br />This book pulls you into the world so profoundly that you miss the characters when you are not reading.  A book that beckons you to re-enter that world is a brilliant book.<br />I read this book in 2 days - I just could not put it down for long enough - I even took a day off work to devour it!
B001BGTWXI|3.0|In my opinion each album from these guys has slowly dropped off from the first and only truly good album, but with that said it's still Slipknot.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This it's such a fun and challenging game. I find that I want to solve 'just one more' level. Any minesweeper fan will go crazy over this game.
B0015DROBO|5.0|This is one of the best Trilogy's that I have ever come across.  The only downfall to the series is that it is only 3 books long, and it's hard to follow up with another series of books that can compare.  My recommendation is A Song of Ice and Fire though.
B00871C09S|5.0|This was filmed before the days of the AC, when windows were open and people had a sense that they were a part of a community.  It is a delightful mix of suspense and comedy, with the action focused on unearthing the dark secrets of a mysterious neighbor.  James Stewart is great as the bedridden sleuth; and his supporting cast of Grace Kelly, Thelma Ritter, and Raymond Burr keep the plot moving.  It's a thrilling Hitchcock!
B00000ADG2|4.0|Even with all the controversy surrounding Lauryn Hill, this is a good album.  Good music is good music, its just that simple.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Sucked me in from the very first level. Thought it would be an easy game to waste some time, but when I realized I needed a pen and paper to remember everything I  knew I was hooked.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This entire series is great, none of the books are let downs, and you just want it to go on and on and on.  The toughest part about this series is trying to find a book after you done reading it, because nothing quite lives up to it...except maybe the Game of Thrones.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Graphics were good, was a little challenging, but an entertaining way to wind down after a long day, did not take long to beat it though.  Looking forward to more rooms to escape from!  Bring them on!
6305291446|4.0|You wouldn't expect a movie that is being revisited 20 years later would be any good, but surprisingly this one isn't too bad.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Awesome app! I like the lighting. Also the alarm is set and available when my device is in sleep mode.
0780626966|4.0|The ultimate collection of Freddy, him and Mike Myers, and Jason, you can't go wrong with any of them.  By todays standards these are more suitable to 1st graders, but they are still fun to watch.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been looking for this to play on my Kindle for months.  I am super happy about this!  I really enjoy Candy Crush Saga.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I travel for work and family events, I have 4 flights I need to make this holiday season for babies births and I am a girl that even in the worst of weather who wants to get here 2 miles of running in at least one a day. With all of that I have got to know what to wear and to pack! With your weather advice across the US and Canada, I know I can be ready for anything because y'all are ready! Thanks!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Okay, the ending is awful! I get it, but honestly, by the time we got to the end I just wanted it to be over. What happened to the author who wrote the first two dynamic, compelling editions in this trilogy? I couldn't put them down!<br /><br />This was boring, illogical, poorly constructed, and more frustrating with every page. Not worthy of the characters, their struggle, or their love story.<br /><br />Sooooo disappointed, as I have really been looking forward to this book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad that it is finally back on Amazon for the Kindle. I was almost ready to give up on it. The game is great and helps us to interact with friends.
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|Dream Theater was faced with a formidable challenge to follow up the masterful 'A Dramatic Turn of Events.'  They came through brilliantly with their new self-titled release.  Why 'The Looking Glass' is not the number one song in the country is beyond me.  I can't wait to hear that thunderous rock live.  The virtuoso musicians in DT keep getting better and better.  I challenge anyone to name a better vocalist than James Labrie.  Buy this disc - you will not be disappointed.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was hooked within minutes of downloading this to my smart phone. Played and the next thing I know it's the middle of the night. Only issue I've experienced is the game graphics do not display properly on my Galaxy Note II. It doesn't affect game play though.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game. It keeps getting better with every level challenge. I just can't stop playing! In love with this app.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So much fun to play. It is very addicting. The best part...you are not fighting anything, just enjoying the game.
B00FAEPX9Y|5.0|I love this singer and all the songs. She is so talented singer song writer.  I have her songs on my mp3 player now listening to them
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So fun to play on my tablet now.  Thank you for doing a great job.  It<br />is very fast &amp; I cannot wait to play every evening.<br />I will suggest to everyone to try this app.
B007WEQ3K8|5.0|there are many apps like this that I have tried but this one is one of the best.  I would certainly reccomend it to any one who wants to spend some time on neurobics!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I could not believe the ending to this...after everything they go through together, they don't get a happy ending...seriously!!??  People read books to escape from reality, to get a happy ending.  If I wanted a disappointing, sad ending, I would stick with cold hard reality and just not bother to read anymore.  I can't believe I wasted $6.99 on this depressing piece of literature.....I really hope that the 3rd movie (if it makes it that far) gets a different ending.  I don't normally say that, but this time, I hope it does.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|I enjoyed this video and found it quite interesting and informative.  I highly recommend this video to everyone who likes music.
B008133DO8|5.0|I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this episode.  It is THE best one yet! It made Sherlock seem more human and not so cold, but still kept him at his genius level!
B00A285OOW|5.0|Amazing book!  I had to buy all of them.  Was disappointed when there weren't anymore to read!  Can't get enough!
B00AWJYJVA|3.0|Lacked excitement. Started to warm up in the last third but extinguished with a puff. Not much else to say.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|very distracting and enjoyable, but there were a couple of levels where the solution was not intuitive AT ALL.  only by looking up a walkthrough on youtube was I able to complete
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this app.Its really easy to use and i love the movies.My family plays this game on our kindle,iphone 4s,andriod tablets.Great job.
B0000C8AV3|2.0|This record is a step up from the three albums that came before it but that's not really saying much. There are some interesting lyrics however that doesn't necessarily mean good songs. Solid melodies and interesting musical phrases are few and far between on this record. There are a couple of good songs, but you have to come to them because they sure are not going to come to you. The bad early eighties production and Dylan's worst singing to date make sure of that. (I have a theory that he permanently damaged his vocal cords during the Rolling Thunder tour. His voice certainly took a turn for the worse after that period. Maybe it was too much smoking, drinking, singing,etc? It's Just a thought anyway.) The addition of former Rolling Stone Mick Taylor on guitar and Dire Straits head honcho Mark Knopfler on production and guitar somehow can't help things either.<br /><br />Dylan neophytes would do well to skip this album. In fact skip his 80's output altogether. Start with the 60's, cherry pick the 70's, and then come back in with the mid 90's material. His output does eventfully get better but sadly it also gets much worse before he turns it around. I must say I am kind of surprised that anyone would give this record Five stars. Three maybe or an over zealous four from the worshiping fan. But five stars!? Really? Even a die hard Dylan enthusiast would have to concede that this is not in the top tier of his material.
B005LAII44|4.0|Great movie but should be watched after the Rise of the<br />cobra. I have to watch it again which is ok.
0525478817|5.0|An incredible book, one of the best I've ever read. Beautifully written, heart wrenching, and everything a book should be. It's YA literature at its absolute finest.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|I bought this video so I can watch it prior to getting the latest Red in the saga. Not disappointed by my decision.
006202406X|1.0|The writing was flat, the plot was slow and boring, and there was absolutely no distinction between Tris and Fours internal monologue. And not to mention the ending felt rushed and unnecessary. Very disappointed with this book, and I was so excited to pick it up as well.
B002NXSRVG|4.0|I liked it but I suggest that you watch all in order. I didn't but caught up with the action.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|i have seen better sharpeners but this sharpener works great and it is well portable with a great price. i made a new edge on my knife which is really good in my standards.
B007REV4T8|2.0|I found this video a letdown in the tradition of 007 movies. The producers obviously tried to each a younger generation but failed to impress me, an avid<br /><br />bond follower.
0345529057|5.0|I bought these books as a gift for a friend . He had asked me for them, he was in prison, I had never sent anything to a prison so I was kind of nervous ,But it was so Easy and they arrived to their destination and most important it made his day !! Thanks !!!
B0083Z614S|5.0|It was delightful.  I would read it again and recommend it to my grandchildren.  What more can I say?  It was nice.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Ms. Roth is indeed dauntless. I know it is her story and she can tell it the way she wanted; I wish she showed a bit of more of abnegation and provided a final book that did not make me want to regret reading the whole series. No movies for me.
B00DZJ82W6|5.0|Such a joy!  Feels like you are right there in the studio.  The Blu Ray also revealed things I have never before heard on this masterpiece of an album.  Sure some of the takes are superfluous, but for the true fan, it's a must buy!  Well worth the wait.  Love the packaging too - a deluxe edition that truly is special....
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It could very much relate to the book. And the author real made you feel like you where in the story and feeling the things that the characters were feeling.
1594202273|5.0|I read a review of this book, put it on reserve at my local library, picked it up when it was my turn, read it, liked it a great deal, and now I'm going to buy a copy to keep.<br /><br />If you're into the genre of meticulously researched histories of weird Cold War atomic goings on, then this book is definitely for you.
B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|I read the other two Bridget books as a result of the movies.  They were good but I could put them down. I kept waking up needing to find out what happened next.  Perhaps it is my age, perhaps my life situation but the antics around Bridget's children had me laughing out loud.  The only thing that I did not like about this book is that the ending was too happy - unrealistic...
1594202273|1.0|None of the material contained in this book is new nor relevant today.<br />The only thing of note appears to be that the author has just realized that technology, any technology carries risks associated with the use of that technology.<br />Perhaps the information could have been conveyed on stone tablets if we had not developed different technological methods that add risk to man kind. But we have probably just traded risks associated with being a caveman for different risks associated with todays technology.<br />Certainly there are more people alive who live longer which should mean that on the average, todays individual has a lower risk than our ancestors.<br />In any event, don't bother to read this book because it contains nothing new, is a jumble of stories and information, some of which may be factual and some of which may be not.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Fun &amp; free, what more could you ask for. Great to do with the kids they are reading and using there brains and are having fun doing it.
1602834865|4.0|Love the house, liked the story and stars, but it is still not as good/great as the eight part series staring Jeremy Irons.  His voice and presence alone make that a stellar series.  The Sebastian character in this movie is so obviously a doomed alcoholic disaster, it is hard to understand Charles Ryder's interest.  It played out so much better in the series.  Still a pleasant and beautifully filmed movie, but the house steals the show.
B00CNQ7CRI|3.0|I really enjoyed catching up with Bridget.  She is just as crazy as ever, just as ridiculous as ever and just as warm and relatable as ever.  I laughed out loud many, many times while reading and even shedded a tear or two.  My one criticism is the ending.  It seemed rushed and anticlimactic. I would have liked a chapter or two of exploring her new found situation before the year end recap in the final chapter.  All in all a very enjoyable read.
B006VFLIYK|2.0|Predicable, somewhat tedious. I found myself plowing through to the end. I try not to abandon a book once I start but this one; I almost did.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The Husband's Secret is one very interesting story told in segments of the lives of different couples.  They all come together in a surprising twist that leaves one thinking &#34;Is that what I would have done?&#34;.  Probably not, but it was still a fun read and I recommend it highly to those interested in a good mystery.
B001TH16DI|5.0|All the great classics, I love these movies, great package deal. Amazon is great to work with, Star Trek 2 wrath of Khan and the latest Star Trek movie make nice tie together
B00E9ZFIMM|3.0|This note pad is nothing special. Just like having a sticky note pad. Can't customize or sync like other note pads are able to do.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Very well written with timely plot.  I enjoy every episode.  The acting is superior and the characters seem very realistic.
B00280LYIC|5.0|awsome graet and fantastic a thrilling adventure percy jackson roms his place in search of  his  mom but what will he do with  only three pearls? making a sacrafice is a hard thing thing to do!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|TY to Amazon &amp; king.com for finally putting this awesome &amp; very addicting game on kindle. My days are fully filled in my office time getting to a higher level. Keep up the good work.
0446310786|5.0|My favorite Classic! I could read this over and over and never tire. If you love a great novel, then this is the book to read.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|It does exactly what it is supposed to do. I love the purple color, it is easy to open and close, and you can charge the kindle without removing the case. I have lots of children borrowing my kindle and this case stays in place. I am so happy I purchased it.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|a very fun and addictive game. graphics are really impressive.You just want to keep playing because you just know you are going to get a little further in the next game.
B005HI4LMS|5.0|I love this movie and so do all of my friends. I actually watched it 3 times in a month and then I went out the buy it. It a great comedy and I hope everyone loves it as much as I do.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This is a great game and highly addictive. It is possible to play without spending  money, but the addictiveness propels me to buy more energy. I would have given it a higher rating but there are two issues with it. It periodically knocks me out of the game where I lose the energy invested. I also seem to be at a point in the game where the story has stalled. I'm hoping for some new scenes.
B00ERIUO02|5.0|How do you follow up a mega-success like \\"Teenage Dream\\"? You shift gears and come up with something equally as entertaining in a different way. Prism packs a wide range of material, from bubble gum pop to deep, melancholy introspection. If you're a fan of Katy's more commercial sounding material, you may be initially disappointed, but spend some time with it and let it grow on you. You'll appreciate it more with each listen. It's still got her signature pop sound, but there's also a whole lot more.<br /><br />Here is a track by track breakdown:<br /><br />1) Roar: The first single and a massive hit, and not even one of the best cuts on the album. I understand why this was released as the first single, it bears the closest resemblance to the songs on \\"Teenage Dream\\" and is a natural choice. But you'll be pleasantly surprised to find that \\"Roar\\" is not the only nugget in this treasure chest.<br /><br />2) Legendary Lover: An over-the-top, up-tempo ballad with a Middle Eastern flair. At times, Perry has a tendency to sing a little flat, and in this song it works to her advantage.<br /><br />3) Birthday: Disco/EDM track with an incredibly catchy verse and chorus. This is a fun song filled with double entendres (\\"It's time to bring out the big balloons\\"). This song doesn't pretend to be anything beyond a good time. One of the best cuts on the album.<br /><br />4) Walking On Air: Also heavily EDM influenced, it sounds like a modern spin on Madonna's \\"Holiday\\", which is a good thing. Throughout the song the drums cut in and out (a technique used several times on the album), which initially is a little jarring. But after a few listens it becomes much more palatable and gives Katy's voice some breathing room and allows her to make use of her falsetto.<br /><br />5) Unconditionally: This is where Katy starts to dig a little deeper. This is one of the many tracks on the album that deals with the theme of relationships and Perry's pain is evident.  In most popular music today,you can hear the auto-tune, but not this track. This sounds like pure, raw, Katy Perry, similar to how you'd hear her live.<br /><br />6) Dark Horse: Like many artists today, she makes use of a rapper (Juicy J) to handle the verse while she takes the chorus. If you're a fan of Macklemore or Flo Rida, two artists that have made a career from this, this will likely appeal to you. I prefer straight KP.<br /><br />7) This Is How We Do: Another fun, upbeat, dance number. She sings this one in a staccato/half rap style that is not unappealing. This is the Katy we used to know, when she was all about having fun.<br /><br />8) International Smile: An upbeat straight-up pop track with a strong melody line and vocal. The lyrics are a little cliche-ridden, however. If you're not bothered by corny lyrics, you'll enjoy it.<br /><br />9) Ghost: One of the best songs on the album, but not likely to be a single. Too dark and introspective. This is obviously about her breakup with Russell Brand and she isn't afraid to put her most personal feelings out there for everyone to hear. The melody in the verse is beautiful and it's only accentuated by the real pain she is able to conjure up when delivering the vocal.<br /><br />10) Love Me: Not one of the stronger cuts on the album. Katy again shows her vulnerable side as she sings about trying to learn to accept herself and all her flaws. The verse is a little too blase and the chorus isn't strong enough to take the song out of first gear.<br /><br />11) This Moment: A slow-paced EDM track that doesn't really qualify as being unique enough to make an album that has similar songs that do it better.<br /><br />12) Double Rainbow: No relation to the Youtube video with the same name (Thank God). A melancholy track that reflects a theme that weaves itself throughout the whole album. \\"Teenage Dream\\" indicated it was time to have fun, whereas \\"Prism\\" suggests it's time for contemplation. This is a good track that deserves several listens in order to to experience all of its layers.<br /><br />13) By the Grace of God: A more traditional ballad with a verse that would not be out of place on a Carrie Underwood album. Perry is again extremely personal with her lyrics as she sings of her struggles with self-image.<br /><br />14) Spiritual: This is not a style you've heard from Perry before, and it's another interesting progression in her growth as an artist. It's a throwback to the eighties, where influences of the Eurythmics, Madonna, Roxy Music and Human League are all prevalent.<br /><br />15) It Takes Two: Another song about her breakup with Russell Brand, where she puts half the blame on herself and apologizes for it. The song has a great bridge, probably the best on the album. Unfortunately the verse and chorus don't hold up as well.<br /><br />16) Choose Your Battles: A slow, dark, EDM track. \\"Why are you trying to make me your enemy?... I'm not fighting anymore.\\"  An appropriate finish to an album that takes chances and chooses to explore some darker themes.<br /><br />Is every track a masterpiece? No. There are a couple of duds. But in a world where you're lucky to get one or two good songs per CD, this album is a home run.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|***SLIGHT SPOILERS***<br /><br />I had been excited for this book ever since finishing Insurgent. I wanted to see how it all played out, what everything meant.<br /><br />As soon as I started reading, something seemed off. The tone that had kept me interested in the story for the past 2 books was missing. The narrative seemed flat, as if the author didn’t care.  Revelations and new information were thrown at the reader left and right, without any buildup or narrative tension.<br /><br />I wasn’t expecting it to all be sunshine and roses—indeed, I would have been disappointed if it had—I was expecting and hoping for Tris and Tobias to work for their happy ending, but to fight their way there, to spill some blood, sweat, and tears, but to be together in the end. It’s an established narrative pattern for a reason.<br /><br />This felt like reading a series of disparate events, rather than a coherent narrative story. I’ve been rooting for these characters for 2 books already. Yet, in this one, I couldn’t feel the same level of emotion about them.  In Allegiant, good storytelling and a compelling tale has been dumped in favor of failed attempts at over-the-top writing gimmicks (the perspective jump adds absolutely nothing to the narrative, as I often found myself having to scroll back to the beginning of the chapter to see who was speaking). And the highly controversial ending adds absolutely no value to the story. Killing off your protagonist is a dramatic and dangerous move that comes off as just another gimmick here, another attempt to substitute for an actual compelling storyline and artificially inject tension and drama into this lackluster work.<br /><br />My conclusion: No. Just no. I would rather rot my brain with badly-written fanfiction than read this book. (And I loathe fanfiction with the passion of a thousand suns.)<br /><br />If you enjoyed Divergent and Insurgent, I would highly recommend creating your own ending for these beloved characters,and pretending this book never existed. That’s what I plan on doing.<br /><br />Shame on you, Veronica Roth. Shame on you.  You had something good, and then you dumped it in favor of this trash.

B002O2THVA|5.0|Saw this as a 11 year old at the Old Campus Drive-In, San Diego,Ca. Many years went by before I ever saw it again and now I own it. Lee Marvin at his best being an absolutely despicable outlaw. James Stewart being the Dude as Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin) calls him. John Wayne being the hard nosed tough cowpoke who gets between Ransom (Stewart) and Liberty. The adorable old fart Andy Devine the local (Don Knotts) Sheriff. The Lovely Vera Miles which Wayne loves but can't tell her before it's too late and Stewart and Vera get attached. Great movie with a awesome ending. If you get a chance to see, rent or buy the movie you can't do much better then this classic.

B005BY3XHC|5.0|I purchased the book to change the way I think. To use his idea's to bring more changes into my life, in a more positive way.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|*Minor spoilers below*<br /><br />Wow, I am honestly shocked by the amount of negative reviews this book has received! I came here to leave a glowing review and can't believe how much negativity I am seeing.<br /><br />Honestly, I thought it was the PERFECT ending to the series. The book gripped me the entire time, even more than the first two in the series did. I couldn't put the book down until I read it from start to finish. The ending... was sad, yes, but completely understandable and necessary. I don't see why so many people are angry that it wasn't a &#34;happy ending.&#34; These books, from the start, have been about a dystopian society rocked by war, death, and destruction. It would have been completely unrealistic, and honestly a bit disappointing, for everything to work out perfectly and all the characters to live happily ever after. I think the author made a very brave (and difficult!) choice to end the story the way that she did.<br /><br />Also, since I know people are going to be comparing these books to THG, here's my take on that aspect. Overall, I like THG a bit better - they're some of my favorite books of all time. However, I liked &#34;Allegiant&#34; MUCH better than &#34;Mockingjay.&#34; Mockingjay was a huge disappointment for me - I felt that the writing style seemed rushed and untrue to the characters, making the major deaths feel pointless and the book as a whole not worth reading. Allegiant, on the other hand, was as amazing to read as the rest of the series; the deaths, though still devastating, felt natural and more sincere. I cried in both books, but it seemed more justified in Allegiant.<br /><br />Obviously everyone has different opinions, but I felt that this was an amazing close to the series. Just because something doesn't end happily doesn't mean it's bad.

B00BD99JMW|4.0|****SPOILERS****<br /><br />I like many of you waited and longed for this book to come out to find out who Edith Prior was and what was the job of the Divergent. Roth did not disappoint me. I never could have predicted the direction she took this series but I feel it was a truthful representation of what happens in war. Am I sad at the end? Yes! Did I cry for Tobias and Tris? Absolutely! And still am! But I don't think this story warrants a bad review.<br /><br />Allegiant was an easy read. I read it in one sitting. And to Roth's credit, I felt I knew Tris's fate before it happened. Little hints were given so that when her moment came I was ready. Still dreaded reading it but I was prepared.<br /><br />I like that Roth continued Tobias's story and allowed us to see him moving in with his life and doing what Tris believed he was born for....to be a leader.<br /><br />Overall I gave it four stars because, come on......I wanted the happily ever after ending......but it was still excellent!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Did I really read this? It seems like a distant fading memory. Something about an evil creature that is a nanny. No that can't be it. What was it? Oh well. It seems all memory of this novel has now faded. What was I saying? How did I get here? I have a funeral to get to.

B003G4W49C|4.0|The university where I was on the faculty used this as required reading for all freshmen students last year.They were to read it and discuss it in their orientation/leadership classes. I did not read it at the time but decided now to see what it was all about. It is a story of how, in the future, earthlings prepare for war against invading aliens from outer space by subjecting young people, ~10 years old, to various challenges to see which are ready for leadership roles in future armies. Why start so young? Well, you have to read on (no spoiler from me here). Without asking too many questions about how would they be able to do what they do, it is an interesting story about interactions between people - some good, some bad, and some who might be good or bad but you don't know as you read. You will have mixed emotions about the main character, Ender, due to what he does, what he experiences and his success/failure. I would recommend it.

Read it or forever be ashamed.

0767827791|2.0|I had difficulty arriving at a title for this review as this film is flawed in so many aspects. I recall watching a tv series entitled \\"Hollywood and the Stars\\", a retrospective on films throughout the 20th century - Picnic was included as a significant one in the 1950's. I've watched Picnic perhaps a dozen times and with each viewing I am more perplexed as to why it was not and, more significantly, still is not critically blasted.<br />For starters let me answer the question I am sure will come up - why watch it so many times if I think so poorly of it? I must be honest: the film does have a certain appeal. Steve Allen's variation of Moonglow is a charming tune that permeates the film and I still enjoy the rather corny little vignettes from the picnic itself. Perhaps they harken back to a more peaceful, simple time in America. And to be fair the Novak-Holden dance at the picnic is something I still enjoy. Or maybe it's as simple as getting enjoyment out of watching something badly done (I refer the reader to \\"Parrish\\"!). I'm not sure. However, the more I've watched it the more flawed it becomes.<br />First and perhaps foremost, William Holden is badly miscast in his role as the down and out \\"young man\\" reappearing after years of absence to his old college buddy. Holden is way too old for this part. In addition he is constantly made to be performing all sorts of \\"youthful\\" activities, spontaneously sprinting around, doing push-ups, etc., as if he had so much boundless energy it couldn't be contained. In actuality the effect creates the impression that he requires a stop at the nearest rest room. To make matters even worse he attempts to demonstrate a dance step to his (underage) picnic date by vigorously clapping his hands and grotesquely twisting his torso totally out of time with the music. To paraphrase the famous Shakespeare line: \\"He doth protest too much\\".<br />Secondly, the dialog by just about every character is incredibly hokey. To go into detail would be impractical. To name a few, Holden's story of being picked up by two women ostensibly for sex, ultimately for robbery, is just not believable. I've been picking on Holden thus far - he is not the only culprit by a long shot. Kim Novak's lines, virtually all of them, are beyond belief at times, most notably when she disses her own sex (her expression not mine). Not just Novak, either - the \\"Certs is a candy mint, Certs is a breath mint-like\\" marriage dialog between Rosalind Russell and Arthur O'Connell is distracting at first and ultimately annoying. Russell as the desperate old maid with her last chance at marriage, at first sympathetic and somewhat compelling, becomes merely irritating. O'Connell as the confirmed bachelor cum thinly disguised dirty old man does not help matters. Additional gems are had from Novak's younger sister and the \\"young man advocate\\" next door neighbor. Even Cliff Robertson, who probably gave the best performance if that term could be applied to this film, gets into the act with his \\"lovemaking\\" scenes with Novak. Add all of this up and you have dialog not worthy of a high school production.<br />Finally, and perhaps most significantly is the message about women delivered in a not so subtle manner. Novak is told by her younger sister at the conclusion that just because she (the sister) has big plans to make a success of herself that is no reason for Novak to be a \\"dope\\" and do likewise - i.e., she should go ahead and run away with the \\"young man\\" she just met yesterday and live happily ever after. Even for the 1950's this is a little hard to swallow. But the best (worst) is saved for last. The viewer is left with Novak's \\"love conquers all\\" choice to run away with the \\"young man\\" who a) has no visible means of supporting himself let alone a wife and the inevitable children now or in the foreseeable future, b) has at best an erratic personal history and probably would not be above spousal abuse. For this Novak is abandoning a man who may truly love her and is a success - not the best reason to get married either, but far better than the choice she made.

B00BD99JMW|2.0|*Sigh*....Allegiant was the only book I was looking forward to this year.  My disappointment with this book has nothing to do with the ending.  My anger is aimed at the dumb explanation for the factions in society.  After that big reveal the book went downhill. I'm so disappointed right now.  At this time, I have no further words for this book.

B004X80QNG|1.0|The goal of WebIS Pocket Informant is to get people to stop using this version and buy Pocket Informant 3.  I refuse.<br /><br />They do that by upgrading the app and taking functions away. Over the last two updates, no functions appear to be added and atleast three functions were taken away. Taking away sync with Toodledo was my last straw. I have used Pocket Informant from the Palm Treo days but no more. I purchased the iphone, ipad, and android versions but never again.<br /><br />I have decided to never purchase anything for WebIS again. The business practices of this company IMO are not user friendly and lack basic business ethics.

She acted no different in this book then she did in all the others.  Just because I want a happy ending to all the books I read, does not make one without a happy ending a bad book!
0385351399|3.0|It’s fitting that a company whose motto is “Don’t be evil” would find a fictional alter ego depicted as a ruthless corporate predator bent on controlling every aspect of human life in THE CIRCLE, Dave Eggers’s fourth novel. The eponymous company (seasoned with a dash of Facebook and a pinch of Twitter) comes to symbolize all that Eggers seems to believe is dangerous in our increasingly open and interconnected electronic world. And while this dystopian thriller is a diverting entertainment, he never quite succeeds in evoking a true sense of dread about where all our friending, following and, above all, our sharing may be taking us.<br /><br />THE CIRCLE is set in an undefined near future on a bucolic campus in Northern California: “Outside the walls of the Circle, all was noise and struggle, failure and filth. But here, all had been perfected.” To this pristine environment comes Mae Holland, a 24-year-old college graduate whose friend,Annie Allerton, one of the “Gang of 40” who runs the Circle, has rescued her from a soul-destroying job with a utility company. Mae is assigned to Customer Experience, where she proceeds from answering routine client queries to total immersion in an increasingly demanding social media world, quickly aligning herself with the company ethos as the computer screens on her desk multiply from two to nine.<br /><br />Mae soon learns that the Circle is involved in a vast array of projects, some serious and others whimsical, like counting the grains of sand in the Sahara. But even the most noble-sounding have a sinister edge. ChildTrack, a program intended to locate missing children, requires permanently implanting a chip into the child’s body. Another, PastPerfect, is designed to recover and compile information about a subject’s ancestry, with disastrous results for the character who becomes its guinea pig. These and myriad other intractable social issues become simply one of “a thousand problems correctible through simple enough algorithms and the application of available technology and willing members of the digital community.”<br /><br />After she commits a minor transgression, Eamon Bailey engages Mae in a Socratic dialogue, smoothly persuading her that complete transparency in a world that no longer harbors any secrets (a status she achieves when she agrees to wear a camera that broadcasts her every action to millions of viewers) is the ultimate good. “It was not knowing that was the seed of madness, loneliness, suspicion, fear,” Mae concludes. For her, and the other acolytes of the Circle, “full transparency would bring full access, and there would be no more not-knowing.”<br /><br />Pitted against the Circle’s growing power is Mercer Medeiros, Mae’s old boyfriend, a man who handcrafts chandeliers from deer antlers. He’s an advocate for the world of human connection he sees undermined as the company’s tentacles extend their reach. And more than that, he vainly tries to persuade a skeptical Mae, “Don’t presume the benevolence of your leaders.”<br /><br />As Eggers peels off the Circle’s friendly mask to reveal the danger he believes lurks beneath it, he strives for a story of Orwellian power. 1984’s “War is Peace” has its analogues in the Circle’s creepy slogans, “Secrets are Lies/Sharing is Caring/Privacy is Theft,” and the omnipresence of cameras, called SeeChange, evokes Big Brother. But THE CIRCLE is more of a piece with the plot-driven novels of Michael Crichton, and not the equal of Gary Shteyngart’s darkly comic SUPER SAD TRUE LOVE STORY. The Wise Men---Tom Stenton, Eamon Bailey and Ty Gospodinov (a Mark Zuckerberg stand-in, complete with hoodie), who “devised the initial system, the Unified Operating System, which combined everything online that had heretofore been separate and sloppy” --- are mostly caricatured. Even the novel’s protagonist has the emotional depth of a Facebook profile.<br /><br />Eggers, who has been atthe forefront of hip literary culture since his 2000 memoir, A HEARTBREAKING WORK OF STAGGERING GENIUS, obviously is a skeptic when it comes to the value of the online world. But it’s a vast leap --- one he doesn’t make persuasively --- from what for most of us is a rewarding experience to imagining there lies behind it a sinister intelligence, scheming to intrude on and manipulate every aspect of our existence, from the commercial to the political. As a consequence, the novel is more appealing as a technothriller than it is engrossing as a serious exploration of some looming technological danger.<br /><br />The revelations about the NSA’s surveillance activities have provoked a firestorm of controversy, even among many who don’t fully grasp their implications. Dave Eggers is less concerned about government intrusion into our private lives and more worried about how much of our privacy we’re willing to surrender without a whisper of protest. While he may not have succeeded in undermining our affinity for social media, perhaps he will induce us to feel just a small twinge the next time we “like” a friend’s photograph on Facebook or “favorite” one of her tweets.<br /><br />Reviewed by Harvey Freedenberg
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I never write reviews for books, but I have to make an exception for Allegiant.  The people who are saying reviewers are bashing the book because they didn't like the ending are mistaken.  I've read several books where a main character dies (ex. The Fault in Our Stars) and I didn't feel the same way as I did reading this book.  Veronica Roth seems to have decided that dying is the only way someone can be honorable or selfless.  Honestly, Tris' death seems unnecessary and senseless and that is why people are upset.  A beloved character was killed. I think it is a testament to the quality of the first two books people have had such a strong reaction to the trilogy's ending. I personally felt that Allegiant seemed half-hearted and reeked of an author trying too hard to tie up loose ends.  I'm sad to say that I can no longer look at the books I once devoured and loved the same way.

B009ZM76J2|2.0|The movie is well done and moving.<br /><br />It is true to the general idea of the book, but it also adds some white guilt for no apparent reason I could see.  For example there is a scene in the movie where the children are taken in by a housekeeper and find that her master rapes her.  This did not happen in real life.
B003XF1OJK|5.0|This book is one of the best sci-fi books written, I have read it twice now. Oh to be assured, the ending doe not change. It just gets better. I got the first version when I got the game, and have played the game many hours, not to mention all levels. But the book this time was better, it gives the reader a greater understanding of the game. Good luck.

B0014Z4OQG|1.0|This movie is horrible. Apparently some guy thought it would be \\"artsy\\" or \\" realistic\\" to strap a camera to his head and get a bunch of jerky out-of-focus shots of loud violence. After about ten minutes of looking at these cinematic convulsions I was starting to get seasick so I stopped watching and just listened while I did something else. What I heard was a lot of \\"Oh my God!\\" and \\"We can't go there!\\" unrelated to any discernible plot. I kept it on anyway until it was over, thinking that no one with any self respect could make a mess like this without putting at least something worth watching into it. I was wrong. This movie didn't even end--it just stopped. I got this CD in a boxed set that contained \\"Cloverfield\\" and \\"Dark City.\\" Here's my suggestion: open the box, take out \\"Cloverfield,\\" and use it for a coaster. Then watch \\"Dark City\\" and be amazed.
