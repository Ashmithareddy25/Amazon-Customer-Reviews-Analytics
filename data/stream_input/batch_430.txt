B00006GA4C|4.0|I fell in love with GFR's 1st album, because it had something that other bands of that time didn't have, it had some unhealthy amounts of energy that addressed the listener at the level of his/her animal instincts. It struck in the gut. Their raw and somewhat primitive sound hit the mark. <br /> <br />This is the 2nd effort by this power trio, and on the risk of being labelled \\"Unhelpful\\" I still say that it's inferior to the debut. Why? Simply because on their quest to develop their style the band strayed away from low-level effectiveness of the debut, while failing to reach the necessary level in songwriting. Most of the music here falls into 1 of the 2 categories; either it's a repetition of what had already been played by GFR or other excellent bands like Cream, or it's chaotic meandering of the band in every possible direction without actually getting anywhere. There are times when the band manages to pull the trick of mixing raw energetics with complex hard-rock structure and plays a song that has everything in its place (the best one is \\"Paranoid\\" and \\"In Need\\"), but these are not many. More often GFR plays a sort of studio-jam, but tries to tame it somewhat, thus leaving behind their main factor of success, terrific live performance. To prove my point, most of the songs here sounded by far better in concert recordings. <br /> <br />Two more points to mention would be these. The first 4 songs sound very similar to the 1st half of \\"On Time\\", with \\"High Falootin' Woman\\" being the most memorable (being generic blues-rock) of them. And the sound of the band improved, too. Gone is that horrible instrument-by-channel mixing which made \\"On Time\\" a chore to listen to in headphones, and the bass went through some distortion which helped to underline Mel Schacher's excellent playing. <br /> <br />All this being said, it's still a pretty fine loud-and-raw hard-rock, which many fans of this band consider GFR's best. While fans of Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin or Cream mightbe somewhat disappointed with subpar songwriting.
B0000AI45P|5.0|this cd is just amazing... i dont know how you could put together a more perfect album, it just doesn't seem possible.... the closest any other album has ever come (imo) is their second album, adventure... each individual track is perfect by itself. put them together and you've got a masterpiece... which this album literally is, a masterpiece... if you don't like it... well... we can put you on an island somewhere in the middle of the ocean for all i care...  <br /> <br />the album starts out with the catchy tune 'see no evil'...followed by 'venus' and 'friction', two other great songs... now we have the masterful title track 'marquee moon'... damn.... i love that song... there is not a single wasted second in this 10+ minute song... then we have 'elevation' and 'guiding light'... guiding light isnt my favorite track on the album, but it is still freakin' great... ahhh, 'prove it', such a great song for so many reasons... where do i start?? the descending guitar riff... OMG!!! its so entrancing, yet so simple i dont know how they do it!!! its just amazing!!! and now for my favorite song... 'torn curtain'.... the single most powerful song ever written... its so mindboggigly beautiful in every espect of the word... the first time i heard it i just had to close my eyes and listen to the end guitar solo... i dont know what it is about that damn ascending solo, but its just so...... amazing... i cant think of any word to describe it... you just have to feel(yes, feel) it for yourself... <br /> <br />now for the cons... not many... not many at all. all i can think of is that it is too short (which is made up for a little bit by the extra tracks) and the fact that they use the same formula throughout the cd... which is fine because its a great formula...this formulwa is to have a catchy main guitar part (sometime with an accompanying part)... what they usually do with this is go between two base notes for this riff... they then have the bass change notes to contrast the main riff, which creats a great effect... then the have a main melody that they play a few times throughout the song with huge, epic solos... of course, the drums perfectly match each song, as is part of the formula... <br /> <br />i dont know... i could be wrong about that whole formula thing... but either way, this is, in my humble opinion, the single best album to ever be released by any group in any genre ever... but that's just me opinion, you will have to buy it and see...
B00005JMAH|3.0|The Good: On the whole I felt that the kids that played the leads acted much better than in previous movies - the forced facial expressions that seems to be a Chris Columbus staple was thankfully absent. The fact that they are becoming teenagers was also captured. The atmosphere was more dark and forbidding. The man that replaced Dumbledore did a fairly seemless job - though he wasn't given mush screen time. <br /> <br />The Bad: I felt as if I were watching two different movies. The cuts from one scene to the next were abrupt. There were major points in the movie which should have never been or been more explained: <br />1) Harry is not allowed to do magic outside Hogwarts - why was he doing a spell in the very begining? <br />2) His father's relationship with Professor Moony and why the Prof knew about the marauder's map.  <br />3) Why the spell Harry says at the end takes on a certain form of an animal.  <br />4) the characters from the the Quiditch team really should have been given some film time - if only for the fact that they play major roles in the next film.  <br /> <br />Some of the other chages were artistic liberty - I know. But most the complaints I listed above really distorted or changed the story.  <br /> <br />The look is better in this film than the previous two but the script has to be more coherent. Worth watching but read the book to fill you in on the missing info -
B0001A79JO|5.0|In March, I saw the Horrorpops open for The Offspring in Amsterdam. They made an impression: by April I had seen five shows, including one in their home town Copenhagen. <br /> <br />Not often does a debut album of a band have such a big amount of quality without the typical over-production sound present with so many new artists. Whether it's punk, ska, surf or good old rock and roll, the band delivers. But the Horrorpops are best on stage: tattooed to the bone, go-go girls flirting with the audience, Patricia slamming the upright bass, Kim Nekroman with an awesome Horrorbeach guitar solo.. it's all there. <br /> <br />And don't worry about being a one-time act: the Horrorpops are currently on tour again in Europe with new go-go Naomi (Mille will be missed though) and going back to the studio later this fall for a second album. <br /> <br />If you're into any kind of rock music or guitar sound, Hell Yeah! will look great in your collection, mixing the best of various genres.
B000002MP2|4.0|Sure it was \\"Longview\\" and \\"Basket Case\\" that made this one a hit, but the band has a good sense of humor and melody that maintains itself throughout the CD. Trying to maintain a punk sensibility, they betray themselves with just a bit too much cleverness; It tends to soften the anger and impact of the songs. But it's just that humor that made Green Day standout among their peers.
0312962118|5.0|Based on a true story, in the 1950s, Snow Wolf tells how the U.S. started the Cold WAr, by sending a husband, wife hit team into Russia to kill Joe Stolin.<br /><br />  The story moves at a very fast clip, and takes the reader from hair breath escapes, and chase scenes to shootouts, and in the end, betrayal.<br /><br />  Truly the best novel about attempted assassination since Fredrick Forsyth's Day of the Jackal.
B000069CWE|5.0|forfiet the game, before somebody else takes you outta the frame. <br />Pts.of.athrty was most definatly the best song on the re-mix album, [Reanimation] although I loved wth&#62;you as well. no im not your puppet. <br />Go LP!!! 2nd favorite band ever. I bought meteora before I bought this, and I saw it laying on the ground and I picked it up and bought it at target. <br />Awsome cd, although they totally ruined frg.10. <br /> <br />
B00005UW9T|5.0|Next to LionKing & Balto, of course.<br /><br />I first heard about this movie \\"Anastasia\\" when it passed thru theaters in Nov'97, but I never got around to seeing it until the first week of Jan'98 - and I'd ended up missing like the first ten minutes of it, due to transportation issues. After the movie, my general thoughts were that it had been just good, and I went on with life, lol. But for some reason, it was about two weeks later, when I suddenly thought - \\"That's an awesome movie!!!\\" and I wanted to go back to it.<br /><br />Then I was so annoyed that I couldn't remember most of it, so I tried to see it again, but it had already left all my local theaters. I spent the next few months, obsessing over anything that I could find about it, and the real story that it's based on, trying to remember every scene. I would even draw out scenes in a special binder that I had put together for the movie, along with pictures from various paper ads, and I also wrote and dreamt about it too. I counted down the days until it would finally come out on video - April 28, 1998, at which point of course I went right out and got it and started watching it over and over, practically memorizing every quote and song. I still have that same vhs even now, and I still think it's an awesome movie!<br /><br />Now that I have the DVD, I love it too. You can check out a bit of how-they-made-it stuff, as well as the official trailer. Plus, you can choose what version to watch, widescreen or fullscreen - *all* movies on dvd should have that option!<br /><br />Hope you enjoy this movie and thanks for reading ;D
B0002IU988|5.0|One of my favorite vocalist is Chris Cornell,if someone had played this CD and didnt tell me who it was I really would have said it was a Cornell solo project,anyway,this CD is AWESOME!Nothing more needs to be said but buy the CD,you won't regret it.
B0001HAHXW|4.0|Before I specifically address this CD, I feel compelled to respond to a few comments I've read re Clapton's \\"qualifications\\" as a bluesman.<br /><br />One reviewer went so far as to compare Clapton's tribute to his hero, Robert Johnson as comparable to Pat Boone and his version of Little Richard's Tutti Fruiti.<br /><br />Another \\"purist blues fan\\" essentially implied that white British guys couldn't possibly compare to Muddy Waters or the other great, black bluesmen.<br /><br />C'mon - what nonsense! When asked what he hoped to accomplish with his music, the late, great Stevie Ray Vaughan said that he wanted to be remembered for taking the colour out of the blues.<br /><br />Eric Clapton is a bona fide bluesman who is on a par with ANY of the blues greats. You can't survive and thrive in an environment as fickle as the music business for five decades without doing something very, very right. We're talking about a man here who is only one of two other artists - Billy Preston being the other - who actually played and recorded with the Beatles..!!<br /><br />Having said this, I partially share some of the sentiments voiced by others here that the album lacks something - \\"energy\\" perhaps. There's no question that technically, Clapton sounds great. His guitar playing is as good as ever and vocally, Clapton sounds better with each passing year.<br /><br />And after paying his dues for 40 years now, Clapton no longer has to feel \\"self conscious\\" about putting out an entire album of Robert Johnson tunes. This blues giant obviously had a very profound impact on a young Eric Clapton and despite all of his musical accomplishments, I don't believe that a younger Clapton could have made this album. However, this 57 year old man is much more comfortable in his skin now that he has been in the past and I'm pleased that he took this step.<br /><br />And after the \\"blues\\" he's experienced in his own life - the death of his son, substance abuse problems, etc - he's certainly earned the right to sing the \\"blues\\". His playing and singing reflect a maturity that didn't exist years ago.<br /><br />In many respects, this album is much like his stage persona. In concert, Eric will never be mistaken for Gene Simmons of Kiss or Elton John. You're never going to see any major pyrotechnics or lavish staging at a Clapton show. You're not even going to get too much stage banter from Eric either.<br /><br />All you'll ever get at an Eric Clapton concert or on his CDs is great music.<br /><br />I've sat and listened to this album dozen's of times while driving to and from work.  And I thoroughly enjoy it. \\"When You've Got A Good Friend\\",\\"If I Had Possession over Judgement Day\\" and \\"Hell Hound On My Trail\\", for example, are great arrangements of Robert's songs.<br /><br />Perhaps Eric makes it look so easy - his performances are so effortless looking that we mistake it for lack of \\"energy\\". Or perhaps I'm subconsciously comparing it to Eric's other tour-de-force blues album \\"From The Cradle\\", which just exudes pure energy and raw blues, both vocally and from his Strat.<br /><br />However, having said all of the above, though, this is still a CD that every blues listener and Clapton fan should have in ther collection. It's a wonderful tribute from one blues giant to another.!!reflect a maturity that didn't exist years ago.    In many respects, this album is much like his stage persona.

B0002IU988|5.0|Finally a rock band splits up and 3/4ths of the band actually produce a recommendable, quality, and actually down right rockin' album!  Lead singer Myles Kennedy makes you listen and say to yourself Scott who?  Kennedy can be described simply as Chris Cornell meets Ian Thornley.  The resemblence to the Audioslave frontman is erie on \\"Find the Real\\", \\"Broken Wings\\", \\"Shed My Skin\\", and \\"The End is Near\\".  Of course the anthem song of the album is \\"Open Your Eyes\\"...a song that sends chills up your spine and motivates you to take on the world!  As far as the rest of the band, former Creed members Mark Tremonti, Brian Marshall, and Scott Phillips are stellar and actually turn it up a notch from their previous performances.  If you want to know what Soundgarden meets Creed on steroids is like, buy the album...you won't be disappointed!
B0001FGBL6|5.0|This album is just incredible.  I absolutly love the hard metal, mixed with Simones amazing vocals.  When i listen to it, i feel as if i have just walked into a movie, and the emotions of the songs carry your heart.  My favorite track is \\"Cry for the Moon,\\" which is just brilliant.  I certianly recommend them to anyone!
B00005PJ6M|4.0|THIS TIME, BILL & TED GET KILLED BY EVIL LOOKALIKE ROBOTS. WHAT FOLLOWS IS A JOURNEY INTO THE AFTERLIFE IN WHICH THEY MEET THE REAPER, TRY TO SAVE THEIR GIRLFRIENDS, AND MORE. THIS IS EVEN BETTER AND FUNNIER THAN THE ORIGINAL MOVIE IS, WHICH IS RARE IN MOVIES! IF YOU STILL HAVEN'T SEEN THIS SEQUEL YET, I'D ADVISE YOU TO DO SO.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I have to make this comment regarding the \\"Special Edition\\" versions of the original trilogy...or, more specifically, the SE version of the first (er--fourth?) film (Episode IV: A New Hope).  I have an original Star Wars book from *1977* which includes some of the scenes which were not in the original theatrical release but later appeared in the ANH special edition.  I'll have to sit down and read the book again then watch the SE edition to be able to list all the scenes, but I can say for certain that the approach to Mos Eisley as well as the Jabba/Han meeting in the Falcon's hanger bay *are in the book*.  So, as far as I can tell, the SE version _really does_ include scenes that Lucas wanted to include in the original release of that film.
B0001L3LUE|1.0|Throughout this entire production of left wing propaganda, Robert was taken out of context and you can tell from the way they \\"clipped\\" video together all throughout.  In addition to this, pay close attention to the part where he talks about the fire bombing of Japan.  You hear the number \\"100,000\\" but look at his lips.  He didn't say it during the interview but they dubbed the audio in.  It's worth rewinding and playing over again to see it.  It's a shame to hear the kid at my video store in Queen Anne, Seattle, WA tell me how good this video was.
B00006BTCA|5.0|I bought this CD on word of mouth recomendation by a good friend of mine and it's one of the best CDs I've invested in!  <br /> <br />The songs are gloomy and really sad at times so if you are looking for something perky and upbeat, I'd recommend the Franz Ferdinand one instead. On the bright side, this is one heck of a cool CD. Can't wait for their new release later this year!
B0002KQNL8|1.0|Terrible. I can remembr being sucked in because i loved the original so much, and just being confused by awful acting, fx, and \\"comedic\\" zombies doing pratfalls. Also, there is a doctor that is obviously retarded. Stick with the original.<br />And speaking of the original, will there ever be a release that uses the original soundtrack? It was changed during rerelease! Luckily, I taped the film from Cinemax ten years ago!
B00004T9UF|5.0|This is, withou a doubt, the best hip-hop album to come out in a long time. It seems the latter part of the nineties was plagued with quite a few who wish they were B.I.G., Tupac, Nas, Wu-Tang, etc. Mathers' albums, as a whole, are head-and-shoulders above much of whats out there. Aside from the wannabes and wish-they-weres the late nineties brought the growing popularity of the Southern and Central rappers, but Shady brings back the damning socil commentary of the late eighties and early nineties with his scathing attacks on censorship, hypocracy and overall ignorance that weighs America down. This album is the most adept presentation in the resume of Marshall Mathers and I only hope that if he does release a fourth album it with be as open, honest and angry as this one. Because while all three of his current albums are great neither the first nor the third are no where near this calibur of this album.
185984054X|2.0|Hitchens cute carpetbagger scholarly style in this book outweighs the small impression it might otherwise have made. He reminds us once again that he is still one of the chief apologists for the political division of the school of resentment, the post-post-modernist informed, new bureaucratic academic conformist's solution to Noam Chomsky. It's funny how this book is really not about Mother Theresa's fallability, but about Hitchens' intended audience; this is merely entertainment for self-styled intellectuals who like to make space for their own mediocrity and inaction by destroying others reputations. Even if Mother Theresa were to truly be a saint, if there is such a thing, it wouldn't have changed anything Hitchens had to say.
0451147960|4.0|Ok. Follet is better than this...  I agree.  But it is still a very entertaining story with some entertaining characters in it.  To the person that said it could have been done in 100 pages, you're stupid, it was to short to start with, especially because you complained about the character development, which would have made the book much longer.  Overall, I liked it, not as good as jackdaws, the man from st. petersburg, ect., but still worth the few hours it takes to read.
6302508878|5.0|In \\"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\\" they ask the musical question, \\"Whatever happened to Fay Wray?\\" Tonight we know the answer since the actress passed away at the age of 96 and of course every single notice of her death mentions the role that made her immortal as the beauty loved by the beast in the 1933 classic \\"King Kong.\\" Wray had been noticed in a few films before that, such as Stroheim's \\"The Wedding March\\" (1928), \\"Thunderbolt\\" (1929), \\"Doctor X\\" (1932), and \\"The Vampire Bat\\" (1933). Then came her rendezvous with the biggest leading man in history and Fay Wray made her claim to the honor of being the greatest screamer in movie history.<br /><br />Fay Wray is remembered not just because she played opposite King Kong but also because as Ann Darrow she was both sexy and vulnerable. Plus she had the big ape's lung capacity beat six ways to Sunday. Granted, the special effects by Willis O'Brien are enough to make this a classic film, the cinematic forefather of \\"Jaws,\\" \\"Jurassic Park\\" and other celluloid monster movies that involve something other than an actor in makeup. But every time you want to reduce \\"King Kong\\" to pure technical achievement, you hear Fay Wray screaming her head off.<br /><br />The story was pretty much a clich&eacute; the moment it was set down on paper. Movie director Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong) has heard the legend of Kong and hires a ship to find Skull Island. Ann Darrow is starving and destitute, but photogenic and he hires her to be the beauty part of the equation in the film he has planned. Jack Driscoll (Bruce Cabot), the first mate of the tub they are traveling on takes an interest in the young girl's safety, and she responds with guarded affection. Then they get to the island and he discovers that he is indeed involved in a love triangle, but the third party is not Denham, but a giant ape.<br /><br />One thing you have to give directors Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack credit for in this film is that they give Kong a big build up and then they deliver. On the way to the island Denham was making a film test with Ann and had her scream. Then she sees Kong for the first time and takes it to a whole new level. At that point the film becomes a series of action sequences as Kong takes the girl into the jungle, Driscoll leads a rescue party after her only to have Kong follow them back to the native village (the look of terror on Wray's face as she runs for her life through the jungle is equally memorable), which Kong proceeds to destroy before being captured. Then there is the final act of the drama as King Kong, the 8th Wonder of the World is put on display in New York City, only to break free, once again capture Ann, and take her to top of the Empire State Building (whose lights will be dimmed tomorrow night in Wray's honor).<br /><br />I think the T-Rex attack sequence in \\"Jurassic Park\\" is one of the greatest in any monster movie ever made, and I have argued that in addition to the special effects and the masterful cutting of the scene, the sound of the T-Rex is an integral part of what makes the scene work so well. Tonight I am going to make the same argument for Kong's first appearance in \\"King Kong.\\" After all, we are talking about mixing stop motion animation with a giant mechanical head, but such \\"primitive\\" special effects are forgiven because Fay Wray's screams convince you it is really happening. She was not remembered just because she was the girl in \\"King Kong\\" (quick, name the actresses who had the female lead roles in \\"Dracula\\" and \\"Frankenstein\\"). She was remembered because she was an integral part of the film's success (To save you the trouble of looking up the previous trivia point: Helen Chandler and Mae Clarke).<br /><br />You might have heard that Peter Jackson, as his next project after \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" is doing a remake of King Kong for 2005. The cast has Jack Black as Carl Denham, Adrien Brody as Jack Discoll, Andy Serkis as both King Kong and Lumpy the Cook (?), and Naomi Watts as Ann Darrow. Watts is a fine actress, but can she scream like Fay Wray? I don't think so. But then Jessica Lange was not exactly a great screamer and her career turned out okay.<br /><br />Final Notes: This is the \\"restored\\" version of the film, but it still does not include the legendary scene when four crewmen who are shaken off the log by Kong fall into a ravine where they are eaten alive by giant spiders. When first previewed the scene stopped the movie cold and Cooper pulled it from the film. The scenes that were cut in the late 1930s and not restored until the 1970s were (a) where Kong pulls Ann's clothes off; (b) the shots of the Apatosaurus (nee Brontosaurus) biting the sailors; (c) Kong eating natives when he breaks through the gate; (d) Kong stepping on a native; (e) Kong biting a New Yorker after escaping from the theater; and (f) Kong grabbing the wrong woman from the hotel and throwing her to her death. It would be nice if they could find the spider sequence or any of the other bits we know were cut by Cooper before the film was released, but it is probably never going to happen.s is a fine actress, but can she scream like Fay Wray?

0451204530|5.0|This is definately a great suspense thriller written by a great writer.  There can be no complaining about plot and character development, because both are handled very well by Mr. Follet in this one.  From start to finish it delivers what it was written to deliver, suspense, action, and plenty of thrills.
0060934719|5.0|Fairy tales tend to lose their sparkle when they're made into books for adults. But Neil Gaiman creates his own sparkling fairy tale in \\"Stardust,\\" an entrancing fantasy tale that never loses its magic. With beautiful prose, likable characters, and a mesh of the grotesque and the ethereal, this is a magnificent story.<br /><br />Years ago, Dunstan Thorn fell in love with a beautiful slave from across the Wall. Nine months later, he got a baby boy on his doorstep. His son Tristan grows up unaware of his heritage. He longs for the beautiful, frosty Victoria Forester, and when she rejects him, he makes a rash promise -- he'll pursue a fallen star over the Wall and bring it back to her, if she gives him her hand.<br /><br />But when he finds the star, he learns that it is a beautiful young girl, a daughter of the moon named Yvaine. The dying Lord of Stormheld threw a gem to the distance and accidently knocked her from the sky. Now his sons are trying to get the gem back, since the one who gets the gem will be the next Lord. What is more, an ancient witch is pursuing the star, determined to cut out her heart so she and her sisters can be young again. To protect the lovely star, Tristan is called on to be a hero, and to learn who he really is...<br /><br />Few fantasy stories are as well-done as \\"Stardust.\\" Gaiman mixes humor, romance, grisly realism and airy-fairiness in a tight little plot. It only really picks up two-thirds of the way into the book, but what a trip it is. It slides rather than explodes to a conclusion, where everything slips into place and all the loose ends are neatly tied together, in a way that makes perfect sense.<br /><br />His writing is a mix of beautiful details and fast-moving plot. Gaiman frequently pauses to describe the creepy Stormhelm, where murdered ghosts watch their brothers compete, to the beautiful forests of Faerie where little sprites mock people. Some scenes -- like a unicorn's skewering a witch -- are breathtakingly vivid.<br /><br />Everybody loves an everyman hero, and despite his mystery background, Tristan definitely qualifies. He's a little goofy and a lot clueless, but his earnestness makes him lovable. Yvaine is a bit off-kilter in a good way, sharp-tongued and a little naive, but a good match for Tristan. And supporting characters like the evil Septimus and youth-hungry witch are solidly written; even Victoria is shown in a new light.<br /><br />The beautiful adult fairy-tale \\"Stardust\\" is an entrancing read, wonderfully written and full of intriguing characters. An outstanding, timeless story, and sure to enchant fantasy readers. (Yes, even the ones who don't like unicorns)d. <br /> <br />Everybody loves an everyman hero, and despite his mystery background, Tristan definitely qualifies.

B00000K19E|5.0|This is one of them films where I first watched it, I watched it once everyday(until 100th time)and my friends used to watch it 7 times in a row sometimes. When I watched Reloaded I didn't like it because the fighting cenes left me confused and I forget what happened and so on(it was a very forgetable film and I was wandering why people were not walking out of the cinema...) Everyone who doesn't mind guns must watch this as soon as possible(the talking is interesting was well).
0061003646|4.0|Agatha Christie dedicated her 1941 crime novel, &quot;The Body In the Library&quot;, with affection to her brother-in-law who had expressed a wish to find a body in the first chapter of her next book.  Agatha Christie so contrived a response that the body could be found in the library at Gossington Hall, home of Colonel and Mrs Bantry, neighbors of her famous spinster sleuth Miss Marple.<br />Accordingly, readers can expect to be entertained by mystery and mayhem, fortified by tea and sympathy, culminating in a well-explained denouement.

B00009V7T2|5.0|First of all, let me just get it out there that I cannot say enough about this album.  I may start to ramble and blubber on, but only because this is one of the best albums I've ever bought, and in my opinion the best album of this decade. <br /> <br />The energy this album and the band's music exudes is ridiculous.  They are all over the place with their high-intensity...well...everything!  If you liked At The Drive-In, you will absolutely love the Mars Volta. <br /> <br />Cedric, the singer, does things with his voice that many singers only dream of.  Think Robert Plant on speed.  It's great that, like other reviewers have said before, he sings much more on this album than screams, which is opposite of his ATDI days. <br /> <br />I don't even know where to begin on this review, much less where to end.  This is definitely one of the stand-out albums of recent memory, and it will stay in your CD player for a long, long time.  It is a shame the band is not more well-known, although it is only a matter of time before they are.
0451199871|4.0|Agatha Christie dedicated her 1941 crime novel, \\"The Body In the Library\\", with affection to her brother-in-law who had expressed a wish to find a body in the first chapter of her next book.  Agatha Christie so contrived a response that the body could be found in the library at Gossington Hall, home of Colonel and Mrs Bantry, neighbors of her famous spinster sleuth Miss Marple.<br /><br />Accordingly, readers can expect to be entertained by mystery and mayhem, fortified by tea and sympathy, culminating in a well-explained denouement.

B000002MP2|4.0|In 1994....the music business had been completely saturated with grunge music....it had dominated the charts for 2-3 years but was on the wane.  Rock music needed a kick in the pants and this was it....part Ramones, part Metal,  Green Day burst onto the scene with thier splendid album 'Dookie' and it was a massive hit.   <br /> <br /> <br />     So if you like crash and bash rock with a little Ramones mixed in,  get this album.  Its one of the greats!!
0452273331|5.0|I don't usually read novels since I'm not into fiction but this novel kept me interested all the way through. The characters are representations of various ideologies and all have various imperfections. Ayn Rand basically leaves her outline for the philosophy of Objectivism for &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; but this book is a good starter for those who may not share such political orientations but are curious. After reading more of Rand's philosophy which are practiced by many people to varying degrees, nonconformity became a virtue rather than a simple constant. Although the characters are polarized versions of the contemporary debate, this is quite acceptable and necessary in a fiction novel since it has a goal of engaging the reader as much as possible. throughout the novel, Howard Roark is held up at the star observer of the philosophy but other less perfect versions are given such as Dominique Francon and Gail Wynand who share similar views, and strive to follow the philosophy as much as possible. In a final throughful courtroom speech Roark admits the limits and obstacles one will encounter in following such an individualistic path but heralds the journey and effort as what is important. Libertarians and many other people will find this book to be quite uplifting while also entertaining. Rand's greatest success in the novel is the portrayal of Ellsworth Toohey as the greatest threat man has encountered. One begins viewing the character as an intriguing and mysterious intellectual with a considerable amount of witty banter. By the end you see him as the most despicable dictator you can ever imagine. An amazing experience to read
B00006RU5B|5.0|First thing's first you just have to buy this CD it kicks ass and if you turn up the volume on songs like Show Me How To Live, Chochise, Gasoline and Light My Way it will surely blow your mind and your head right off!<br />If you are a huge fan Rage Against The Machine (like I am) and a big fan of Soundgarden (like I am) the sheer strength and power in Chris Cornell's voice and the pure anger in Tom Morello, Tim Commerford and Brad Wilks exquisite playing you get the perfect band.......AUDIOSLAVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />There are a few surprises on the album; such as the haunting The Last Remaining Light and Getaway Car.Also the terrible truths in Cornells vocals and lyrics every single song.<BR>The intensity on this album is just phenomenal you don't know whats going to come next.But when you do final realize it's knock out punches come at you again and again.<br />Do AUDIOSLAVE the honour of buying their album and find out what the hole rock world is in an uproar about!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0001ME5L2|4.0|This album is generally far better than 'Let Go' cos all the songs are equally so much nicer than those previous ones. Wanna highlight two generic songs 'Don't Tell me' and 'Happy Ending', they are really really 2 of the best songs I've ever heard. Thank u Avril for bringing us such a well-explained emotion out this album. <br /> <br />Besides, 'How Does It Feel' is stunning, too. Don't you guyz think the ending part can only be performed by Avril with her unique voice and she's been shouting out loud just great to touch everybody's heart. <br /> <br />Hope to see her third single coming out as this song and I wonder what the video would look like. She's too cool to resist.
B00026YO36|5.0|This is yet another quality album from Mark Lanegan and his crew of well known and proven musicians that play on it.Features Chriss Goss, Josh Homme, Nick Oliveri, PJ Harvey, Dave Catching, and others. Nothing like previous work with Screaming Trees or Queens, Lanegan continues to evolve and produces music with quality and integrity rarely seen in today's music environment.<br />A voice unlike any. Is compared to others, like Tom Waits, no other has the pure grittyness and edge of Lanegan. This album was worth the wait.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Bravo to Michael Moore for producing a courageously honest AND entertaining movie.  Don't listen to critics, just see it for yourself.
B000001GKC|5.0|This symphony opens with one of the most gorgeous passages for cello ever written, and although I am not one to rave on and on about the Vienna Philharmonic, they deliver this magical beginning as well as I've ever heard it.  Herbert von Karajan takes his time here, and the orchestra follows suit with a glorious, often magic performance.  Although there is no single \\"right\\" approach to this music, I confess that I prefer my Bruckner to err slightly on the slow side.  The composer's long phrases are so beautiful that it seems like a waste to rush through them, and I like conductors who can linger on the huge paragraphs (and orchestras with the technical prowess to support this approach).    In what would be his last recording, von Karajan seems to have found more quiet mystery here than usual (as in his final Bruckner Eighth, also with Vienna).  This is a glowing, serene journey -- different from say, Georg Solti's slightly faster, and more intense version with Chicago.  The sound quality is excellent, as well, even if to my ears not quite as ideal as for that Eighth.    As one of Bruckner's most popular works, the Seventh is well-preserved on disc, in a crowded cluster of memorable recordings from many eras.  I also admire Christoph von Dohnanyi's beautiful version with the incomparable Cleveland Orchestra, and the aforementioned Solti gives me more pleasure than I might have thought at first.  But this final von Karajan breath does seem to have a special aura.
B00005JLEX|4.0|...I'm going to do a proper review not just a gush-piece about how great it is that the DVD is coming! <br /> <br />First of all, I think these first series had a quiet charm about them. They were plausible, and the characters at least passably likeable. E.g in 'The Jacket', George and Jerry stuck by Elaine and didn't abandon her cranky dad...which you wouldn't have blamed them for doing. The early series also include Jerry's stand up routines, which I like! <br /> <br />Now, some people prefer the later series, many of which omit the stand up routines, and show the main characters to be selfish, and mean. Each to their own but I prefer the earlier ones. You could empathinse more with the gang back then.
B00000K2W1|1.0|Well I guess thath they didn't have a lot of songs to choose from since all of her music is just plane crap.
B00008EY65|5.0|After crafting an unappreciated classic with Blade 2, director Guillermo del Toro brings Mike Mignola's classic Dark Horse Comics character to life in this stunning and superbly crafted film.  In a last ditch effort to turn the tide of World War II, a Nazi experiment to bring forth a creature of destruction results in the coming of a horned, red skinned creature, aptly called Hellboy (Ron Perlman, perfectly cast), who over the years is raised by Professor Broom (John Hurt) and works for the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense, battling otherworldly creatures alongside his amphibious partner Abe Sapien (played by Doug Jones and voiced by Fraiser's David Hyde Pierce) while nursing a love for the pyrotechnical Liz (Selma Blair).  del Toro and his crew have really crafted something special here, paying wonderful homage to Mignola's source material while del Toro's screenplay adds another layer of development to the characters, taking the relationships between Hellboy, Broom, and Liz to never before imagined heights.  Perlman, mostly known for his role on TV's Beauty & the Beast, is perfect is Hellboy, and I can't imagine anyone else whether it be Nicolas Cage or Vin Diesel (both of whom were rumored to have attachments to the film in early development) to play the hero.  It's not perfect, and not up there with the original Batman, Blade, or X2: X-Men United; but Hellboy is without a doubt one of the most brilliantly conceived visual feasts adapted from a comic book of all time, and fans of Hellboy old and new will find plenty to admire with this film.
B000002UAX|5.0|I am going to have to disagree with you, for one thing you said Black Sabbath was a 60's band,NO! Their first album was made in 1970 and ask any heavy metal guitarist who they were influenced by and what will they usually say either Hendrix or Black Sabbath.Next, you compared the beatles to BSB well here are differences <br /> <br />1.Listen to every beatles album from Please Please Me to Abbey Road and you will hear an evolution in their sound <br />2.BSB did not write their own songs, Lennon/McCartney was the best songwriting duo of all time <br />3.The beatles had a fantastic work ethic they put out 13 albums (one a double) plus about 30 singles in a span of 6 years, and you will not find very much filler on any of their albums either <br />4.the Beatle's songs have stood the test of time forty years later people still love hey jude,let it be, and a day in the life, how many people will remember \\"quit playing games with my heart\\" 30 years from now <br />5.BSB sucked, the beatles did not <br /> <br />I challenge you Frank to listen to the White Album and understand why so many people love this album do not confuse this with \\"I want to hold your hand\\" beatles era this album is completely different from that, if you listen to it and do not like it,fine, but do not compare them to the backstreet boys that is just insulting.
B00018D44U|3.0|Well, having been a huge fan of Norah's first album, I can attest to how disappointed I was in this one.  It does have its moments, such as \\"Those Sweet Words,\\" and \\"Don't Miss You At All.\\"  Those two songs are golden and show that shadow of her former self we loved.  This album, however, has descended the bar from beautiful jazz piano to twangy country-esque music.  As always, lyrically she astounds, but the songs themselves leave something wanting.   <br />Though I miss the old sound, this album overall isn't bad.  But, as I said, it does just leave that feeling of something missing.
B000002KHH|5.0|This is the greatest Black Sabbath album by far with the kick ass songs \\"Paranoid\\", \\"Iron Man\\" and \\"War Pigs\\". I love \\"Paranoid\\", Ozzy proves how great of a frontman he is when he sings the lyrics in this classic. Also Tony Iommi proves he is just as good as Jimmy Page and Eric Clapton with his precise guitar playing. Black Sabbath is the second greatest band ever right behind Led Zeppelin and beating Nirvana and Metallica. I've had this album for a very long time and I still love it just as much as when I got it. This is an album any metal, no, rock n' roll, no, music fan can't afford to be without.
B000002UAX|5.0|This 2-CD album is the closest thing to perfection the Beatles ever released.  There are gems in here, waiting to be discovered, songs that on other albums would have been centerpieces.  It kicks off with the up-tempo \\"Back in the USSR\\", a song that will get you out of your chair.  It never looks back.  The highlights off this album are well-documented, but there are many songs such as \\"Long Long Long\\" or \\"Cry Baby Cry\\" that arent as well known.  My personal favorite is \\"I'm So Tired\\".  Even the oft-ridiculed Revolution 9 is an interesting listen.  This is the best Beatles record, and even their greatest hits album \\"1\\" cant touch it.  My only regret is that \\"Hey Jude\\", recorded in these sessions, wasnt included.
B000066NW0|1.0|Avril Lavigne is possibly the best example of pop music gone wrong.  Pop stars like Hilary Duff and Britney Spears at least admit that they are pop.  Avril Lavigne, however seems to be in tottal denial that she too sings pop music.  In fact my first reaction to her new song was \\"Is that Vanessa Carlton or something?\\" Hot topic doesnt make you punk.  Naming a song skater boy doesn't make you punk.(sorry i spell it in english)  Someone could be dressed up to their eyes in abercrombie gear and still be punk.  Clothes don't make someone punk and neither do annoying little 13 year old fans who should be drowned in the hudson river.  I respect Britney Spears more than I do Avril because at least Britney doesnt tell her fans to \\"get a life.\\"  To quote Jack Black in  \\"School of Rock, \\"You were so caught up in trying to make it, you forgot about one little thing.  Its called the MUSIC!\\"  And thats exactly what avril has done.  She is a fake, ugly, ripped off pop star who wouldn't know who Tim Armstrong is if he raped her.
B00005JNEI|1.0|I thought this movie was nothing but weak entertainment. If this movie pursuades anyone's vote this November, then those people need to stop relying on the media to tell them the \\"truth.\\" I thought it was interesting how Moore mentioned that Bush spent most of his time on his ranch and not running the country. I thought it was funny that one of the clips showed Tony Blair with Bush \\"hanging out at his Ranch.\\" Bush said it himself in the film that it is possible to do his job outside to Oval Office, the same as Clinton doing his job from Camp David most of the time. There is plenty more I would like to point out, but I'm not real sure how much space I have to write on this thing. Regardless, I didn't like this movie and I think that Michael Moore needs to search outside of Kent Mighigan for concrete evidence of absolutely nothing.
B0000025US|5.0|My apologies to Satriani/Vai/Johnson, but these guys are THE original guitar trio. Each has a unique style, but somehow it all works together brilliantly. The compositions range from soft and mellow to all-out explosiveness. For anyone who thinks guitar wizards like the aforementioned G3, Malmsteen, Van Halen, etc. are the greatest guitarists of this era - better save a spot for DiMeola, DeLucia, and McLaughlin. These guys are playing acoustic guitars, not tricked-out electrics with lots of special effects. Besides all of that, this album is very listenable and the intensity of the performances is uplifting.
B00028HBKM|5.0|The movie was so powerful and moving that I could not get it out of my head and returned to see it four times (and have pre-ordered the DVD).     The phrase \\"the blood of Christ\\" has been used so much that it had lost it's impact for many and was merely symbolic. Gibson's movie returns substance and literal meaning to the phrase.    After seeing the movie, \\"the blood of Christ\\" has new meaning.
B000148KK2|5.0|Good job Diana! I thought her last two efforts were pretty weak for her, lots of boring schlock, not even fun jazz to listen to -- especially compared to the \\"Love Scenes\\" CD. <br /> <br />This one is excellent. I'm really glad Diana decided to branch out and \\"experiment\\" or at least try some new things. I like every song on this CD. I find the entire package very interesting. <br /> <br />As much as I enjoy the classics and standards, really how many times can one hear \\"Route 66\\" anyway? These songs are soothing, intriguing, and thought-provoking. It takes guts to step away from the standards and I'm glad Diana took the chance. I'm looking forward to more such CDs in the future.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|When my boyfriend brought home the Firefly series on DVD, I was very skeptical.  A western set in the future with outlaws, \\"ladies of the evening,\\" a preacher and so forth--all on a spaceship?!  How much testosterone could one series possibly contain?  Ugh.  Then I watched it and I fell in love--with the characters, the relationships, the dialogue... even with Serenity herself.  I cannot believe this show was cancelled!  It has something for everyone all wrapped up in gorgeous sets and the highest production quality.  Watch it now and you'll be clamoring for more!
B00018D44U|4.0|I can't stop playing this cd! Smooth sounds and vocals. My favourites are 'In The Morning', 'Toes' and 'Humble Me' I feel that Norah has a lot more potential which we'll probably hear on her future recordings. If like me you are enjoying this cd then you'll probably like Ken Hensley's 'Proud Words On A Dusty Shelf' cd as well as his 'Eager To Please' cd and his latest 'The Last Dance' cd. <br />Enjoy!!!!!!!!
B000002HH2|5.0|When you've made one of the best electronic pop albums ever on you're DEBUT effort, how is it possible to follow it up?  <br /> <br />Bjork didn't fail to dazzle fans or critics with her amazing sophomore album, Post. No second album jinx here. Just imaginative, creative, and eclectic POP music. And yes its pop music, Bjork fully embraces the word. For all its zany characteristics, Bjork still wants to be able to connect with people, and I love her for trying.  <br /> <br />While Debut definitely had some untraditional instrumentation for electronic music, Post pushes Bjork sound even further. Like a vibrant neon quilt, Post is a patchwork of musical styles from trip hop, to techno, industrial, orchestral, to big band, to ambient. It's not as sonically cohesive as Debut or Homogenic, but amazing none the less. Its also an album of larger emotional and sonic depth. Its a roller coaster with the big highs and lows. In America especially, we want to put stylistic straight jackets on our artists and become nervous when they stray outside of their \\"normal\\" genre range.Bjork has the courage and the freedom to break these imaginary chains.  <br /> <br />While Debut co producer Nellee Hooper is still around, he takes on more of a secondary role this time, with Bjork pushing her own creative and production prowess.  <br />Techno godfather Graham Massey from 808 State shows up, as does Trip Hop Maestros Trickey and Howie B bring their production savvy.  <br /> <br />The first track, the is the dark, brooding industrial tinged hip hop ofArmy of Me (co written with 808 States Graham Massey for the first album, but was not included there) is one of Bjork's best singles to date. Bjork is one of the few artists where her English-As-A-Second-Language actually only enhances her songwriting and metaphors, coming up with amazingly creative lyrics and metaphors. A raw and powerful emotional tale about a women fed up with the apathy and ambivalance of a loved one. The huge heavily reverbed dirty drum break is similar to the Beastie Boys \\"So Whatcha Want\\" (who actually deliver a remix of Army of Me on the single)  <br /> <br />The PERFECLTY named Hyper-Ballad is arguably the best song of Bjorks career. Raw. Emotional. Beautiful. She explains the trials and tribulations she has to endure to be in a relationship. Its never pop lyrical cliches. Who thought \\"car parts, bottles and cutlery\\" could be so poetic. The simply gorgeous chorus \\"i go through all this,before you wake up, so i can feel happier, to be safe up here with you\\"  <br />Relationships aren't easy, but Bjork is willing to stick it out.  <br />Musically its nothing short but miraculous. Shimmering synths, deep sine-wave bass, 8-bit Nintendo soundscapes, lush, real orchestral strings(a foreshadow to her \\"strings and beats\\" of her Homogenic album), skittering, but light drum n bass inspired beats that launch into a full four to the floor techno zenith on the second chorus.  <br /> <br />The Modern Things is like walking in an alley between a video arcade and a construction site. Industrial percussion and Sony Playstation synths play off of each other, while Bjork rambles whimsically about the strange thoughts if things like cars and computers are just as old as dinosaurs.  <br /> <br />It's Oh So Quiet is an exciting, fun departure for Bjork in her solo work. Ditching the synths for a live Big Band cover. People love it or hate. I personally love it. Though Bjork fans know she is no stranger to jazz with her jazz project, Gling-Glo. Its fun, hilarious, and its Bjork with a great sense of humor.. its an homage to a musical era gone by.  <br />The Spike Jonze directed video only adds more delight to an already great song.. a Modern L.A. take on musicals of the early 20th century, complete with great choreography and dazlling overhead shots.  <br /> <br />Enjoy Has Bjork returning to darker material. A dirty, sexy, lo-fi electronic slow burner written and coproduced by Tricky. Bjork sings ecstatically about sensual and psychological pleasures over explosive lo-fi beats.  <br /> <br />You've Been Flirting Again once again shows those early Homogenic like string section, as Bjork laments over fading love.  <br /> <br />Isobel is a fan favorite,(though not of mine) mixing dramatic cinema orchestral flourishes, percolating synthesizers, and as usual Bjork is singing her @ss off with emotion. Lyrically complex as ever, but not as arresting for me. An amazing video though made it all worth while though.  <br /> <br />Possibly Maybe has Bjork in trip hop mode, even outdoing trip hop trauma queens like Beth Gibbons of Portishead. Orchestral flourishes are awash again, with Bjork once again kicking lyrical cliches on their side about lost love.  <br /> <br />I Miss You (co written with trop hop maven Howie B)is her funnest dance track since Debut's Bigtime Sensuality. And what an amazing lyric that seems to sum up Internet dating before it was even possible...\\"I miss you, but I havent met you yet\\" A big, infectious latin dance track with samba rhythms, latin horns, guitar, accordian, you name it. Fun and inventive if it doesnt put a smile on your face and your foot at least tapping, check in to a local hospital.  <br /> <br />Cover Me doesnt do much for me as a song, however it is inventive in its stark arrangement and east Asian instrumental flourishes.  <br /> <br />Headphones is Bjorks own twisted take on \\"Last Night A Dj Saved My Life\\" an ode to music, and to headphones itself..turning off the lights, lighting a candle, putting your headphones on, and getting lost in a sonic adventure..as you will on this track that makes good use out of the stereo field.
0689859368|1.0|I picked this book up in hope of an original spin on fantasy novels but put it down after the first chapter after discovering that it was merely a complete rip off of A Series of Unfortunate Events! (The great thing about A Series of Unfortunate Events and lemony snickets work is that it can't be copied without the copy becoming immediatley recognizable as a phony, as this book was). The entire premise of this book is a complete redo of A Series of Unfortunate Events, three children move into a strange place and discover a disturbing secret they must solve, sound familiar, well it should. The naration style of the book is exactly the same as Lemony Snickets with warnings and the story being told as if real. The characters are almost carbon copies of the Baudelaire children in every aspect. This book is merely an atempt to \\"cash in\\" into the popularity of the black style comedy that Lemony Snicket patented. I emplore you not to read this book, instead read it as it was originally titled The Bad Beginning by Lemony Snicket. If i were Lemony Snicket (AKA Daniel Handler) I would sue Mr. DiTerlizzi for Copyright infringment.
B00004Y6TQ|5.0|elmasongs is the EP/Soundtrack to the stunning Lars Van Trier movie Dancer In The Dark, starring Bjork as a poor, factory worker Czech immigrant to the American Northwest, who is slowly going blind. She has to support herself, and her son, who without an operation, will suffer the same fate that she does.  <br />Her refuge from her sad and tragic life is the fantasies in her head about being the star of American Musicals. Its her own \\"Secret Life of Walter Mitty\\"  <br />A set of tragic mishaps and circumstance, Selma is thrown into horrible, gutwrenching freefall with catastrophic results.  <br /> <br />Selmasongs represents the musical tale of the story, the fantasies in Selma's head and it(like all bjork works of art) runs the gamut of emotion from heartbreaking tragedy, to ecstatic joy, to majestic beauty.  <br /> <br />There's probably only one small complaint about Selmasongs..is that it clocks in at barely a half an hour. Also I think it would have been nice to include the ORIGINAL versions of the songs from the film on to soundtrack instead of the slightly altered versions presented here. Also missing is Selma's/Bjorks heartbreaking version of \\"My Favorite Things\\" from the Sound of Music.  <br /> <br />A musical is logical progression for Bjork. She has an eclectic musical past. From the rock of the sugarcubes, the jazz ensemble Gling-Glo, her solo electronic based work, and her orchestral string work on the Homogenic album. However Strings dominated Homogenic, Bjork is in full command of an entire orchestra including brass, woodwinds and timpani, along with stringed instruments. This makes for captivating and inventive soundscapes next to sampled found percussion and electronic beats on the soundtrack.  <br /> <br />Overture is a majestic orchestral instrumental that opens the both the film and the album. A beautiful 3 minute and 38 second mini opus with dramatic horns and timpani. Filled with highs and lows, quiet and loud, using the full dynamic range. Breathtaking.  <br /> <br />Cvalda is \\"Its So Quiet\\" from Post on an adrenaline rush. Post-Industrial-Showtune music? A magical, whimsical, joyful tune featuring French actress extraordinaire Cathrine Denevue. Only Bjork could pull off a genre mash like this, and its amazing. The buzzing and clanging of factory machines turn into percussion, over a technicolor 1940s Vincent Minelli showtune score.  <br /> <br />I've Seen It All is the beautiful ballad from the film, featuring Thom Yorke from Radiohead. Its everything you would think if your a fan of both artists, simply stunning. This time train tracks and train noises become the percussive base of this ballad. Trademark lyrical Bjork brilliance is still at work. \\"what about china, have you seen the great wall/ all walls are great if the roof doesnt fall\\"  <br /> <br />Scatterheart is a song that worked better in the film than it does here on the album. I miss the duet between Selma and her son, and would have preferred that version. Here its just Bjork singing. Though the electronic percussion and bursts of noises and clicks are vintage Homogenic, while the bassline and arrangement would sound perfect on Debut. Its a decent song, but the movie version blows the album version away.  <br /> <br />In The Musicals is another showtune on adrenaline, and once again its a great number. The song sums up the fantasy part of the movie...\\"theres always there to catch me\\" In Selmas head, her musicals always have a happy ending, with her as the hero, getting saved in the nick of time. Bjork dilivers a great vocal performance...its not all bombast..but she can pull back to be delicate and quiet.  <br /> <br />107 Steps really doesnt work outside of the movie. You have to know exactly whats going on in the scene to know whats going on. Like the rest of the album, I love the experimental found sound percussion and shuffling bursts of noise and industrial noises. It just feels out of context o the movie.  <br /> <br />New World Takesthe Overture from the beginning and turns it into a lyrical tour de force finale. Bjorks beautiful vocals, over electronic bursts of noise beats, and a beautiful orchestral score. Just like on Homogenic, the album had its dark spots, but Bjork leaves us with a sense of optimism.  <br /> <br />Its a shame you cant give half stars, because I would give the amazing Dancer In The Dark 4.5
B0002858YS|5.0|This is a very cool cd. All the tracks are great. Some lyrics are just genious. Check it out
B000002HPV|4.0|Bjork was unfortunately a victim of type casting. I've NEVER bought the \\"Icelandic Pixie\\" thing she was labled with. I always knew Bjork was a mature, serious, emotional, and capable artist.  <br /> <br />Some say her third album Homogenic was a shock after her first two eclectic, but for the most part up/lighter sounding albums.  <br />Homogenic's icy orchestral strings, stuttering beats, and burts of experimental noise was definitely a darker, more somber affair. Rumored to be inspired by the break up from Drum N Bass don Goldie, it seems our little pixie had taken off her rose colored glasses. But like all of Bjorks album's its nuanced anf full of emotion.  <br /> <br />If you look hard, you know the strings have always been there...and began creeping in especially on the Post with songs like Hyper-Ballad, Isobel and You've Been Flirting Again.  <br />The darkness was also evident on tracks like the amazing Army of Me and Enjoy. This is a logical step in a musical direction.  <br /> <br />Her most sonically cohesive album to date, the electropop sensibilities are gone (with Post and Debut cohort Nellee Hooper gone with it), in favor of obscure IDM sonic architecture of techno innovator Mark Bell of the group LFO.  <br /> <br />While I love Bjork's willingness to experiment, I must admit I liked her more accessible work better. Homogenic is a great album, but I miss the infectious fun of I Miss You and Bigtime Sensuality.  <br /> <br />However, if this IS a breakup album, its one of modern popular musics best, with the most interesting and novel take on it without the I WILL SURVIVE cliches. It's a woman who's taken a few punches, but gets up, marches triumphantly forward, and never becomes bitter.  <br /> <br />Homogenic opens up with the electro-bolero of Hunter a testament to the bravery that is Bjork. Life and all its complex twists and turns is her mission, and she isn't stopping for a minute till mission accomplished. Its stuttering Drum N Bass inspried beats and deep bass, with bolero string patterns and accordian playing make up for inventive musical combinations. Amazing trademark lyrics like \\"I thought I could organize freedom, how Scandanavian of me!\\" are brilliant as usual.  <br /> <br />Joga is the albums highlight, and either ties or only loses to Hyperballad by a nose as Bjorks best song. Its Homogenic's signature sound..Beats, String, Voice all melding perfectly together.  <br />Bjorks passionate ode to her best friend over beautiful strings courtesy of the Icelandic String Octet(featured through out most the album) A gut wrenching chorus of reverence and homage, how she feels like shes in a state of emergency.. it can be read several ways.. an excited enjoyable sense of chaos, or perhaps a state of birth..EMERGEncy. Take special note to the subtle time signature changes in the peice. Breathtaking.  <br /> <br />Unravel is a gorgeous ballad, and lyrically inventive take on missing a lover who is far away. Her heart unravels like a ball of yarn \\"the devil collects it/with a grin/our love/our love/in a ball of yarn..he'll never return it/and when you come back, we'll have to make new love\\" Achingly beautiful. stark. emotional.  <br /> <br />Bachelorette both in musical and video form is the sucessor to Post's Isobel. And just like Isobel, it's a song I appreciate, but can never get into. And like Isobel, the terrific video saves the song for me. The theatrics go over the top both lyrically and with the overly theatrical string section. Its a ragged burst-of -noise beats are my favorite parts of the song.  <br /> <br />All Neon Like would be the musical kin to say Headphones on Post. Bjork has a knack of nailing perfect song titles, because close your eyes and listen to this song and you''ll imagine the percolating bursts of light energy.  <br /> <br />A song like Immature is what I love about Bjork. So many times we can blame the other person for our faults or why the relationship went wrong, but Bjork takes responsibility herself, for trying to find a lover to fill the voids in her life.  <br /> <br />Alarm Call Is a glimpse of the fun loving bjork I love, and the most optimistic track on the album. Its Bjorks take on urban r&b, but you know since it's Bjork its going to be bolder and better. Its essentially a \\"everyone join hands and love each other\\" track, but you know Bjork is smarter and more clever than that, always eschewing cliches for inventive lyricism. Her \\"ghettoblaster\\" is back from More To Life Than This, and she wants to go to the mountain tap, blast it loud, and free everyone from suffering. Yeah it sounds sappy on paper, but wait till you hear it.  <br /> <br />Pluto is the only proper 4 to the floor dance track on here. Don't be fooled though, its chaotic, frenetic aggressive, and sonically alienating..which is exactly what she wanted, so a job well done.  <br /> <br />All Is Full of Love leaves us with a beautiful sense of hope.A slow shimmering ballad with a call and response chorus. Love may knock us down, but its never goes away, you just have to open your eyes and be ready to receive it.  <br /> <br />The perfect, optimistic end to a \\"breakup album\\". You did a good job Bjork. You felt the pain, you worked through it, you learned from it, and you were ready to move on to the next big thing in your life. And your fans are right there by your side.
0141301104|2.0|If you look at the reviews on this book that are one starred, you will notice that most of them are angry at how witches are portrayed because Roald Dahl says 'real witches' and they assume he means Wiccans. He means the people you find in fairy tales, you morons, not Wiccans. I was amazed that people could be so stupid. <br /> <br />That being said, I did not really enjoy this book. It was not funny and a bit gruesome. However, it was exciting.
B0000246S6|5.0|German choir director Bruno Kittel (1870-1948) occupied a leading place in Europe during the first half of the 20th century. His 'Kittelsche Chor' was founded 1902 and soon became renowned as one of the best choirs in the nation and even in the entire Europe. Kittel is also known for his work with conductors Oscar Fried and Wilhelm Furtwangler (the Berlin 1942 edition of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is a robust performance that also includes Tilla Briem). Notwithstanding limited sonics, the 1941 recording of Mozart's Requiem is a moving account; heightened by elite-status choral singing and by the masterly orchestral control of the Berlin Philharmonic, the tableau is not complete without the very good--and sometimes impressive--soloists. This album discloses a trailblazing account of Mozart's justly famous Requiem. Kittel's will remain a classic reading of the masterpiece : Power, tension and the heavenly sense of a tragic era, but not without an unmistakable mozartian temperament. His approach, typically 'germanic' and rather straightforward in character, was a good fit for the Berlin Philharmonic's glorious sound. Kittel also produced some Bach, including a very good version of the StMatthew Passion--of which some excerpts are to be found here. This recording of the Requiem is meaningful because it is one of the first studio recordings (maybe the very first) of the work. It also documents music making during the Nazi regime. The somewhat somber light of the work is reflected powerfully, and despite the precarious quality of sound we do hear a certain amount of details--enough so, i can assure, to enjoy this momentum of sensational musical memorabilia.
B00028HBKM|2.0|There's nothing quite like taking a universally important story, coveted by millions of people, and turning into a movie which makes millions of dollars.  The source material itself is really the only way I can rationalize its success.  The movie was not the \\"masterpiece\\" it was hailed as.  The camera movements were awkward, the editing horrid, the slow-motion unbearable, and the lighting was often too dark to even guess at what was occurring.<br /><br />The only thing this movie made me feel (and this is my personal opinion) is disappointment.  I was disappointed in human kind.  From this retelling of Jesus' story I realized how his name is used in vain every day.  Jesus' teachings went completely ignored.  We are no better today than those who crucified him.  Perhaps that is a bit cynical, but it is what I got from the film.  I felt terrible for Jesus because his death seems to have taught us nothing.<br /><br />And to answer the questions before they are even brought up, I was raised Catholic but decided I'd rather take Jesus' advice than the church that supposedly follows him.
B000002L5P|5.0|I recently heard about this album from a friend, and after coaxing me, I decided to buy it. He is such a big Smiths fan, so like a good friend, I decided to give it a listen. What I heard was simply amazing. I never heard lyrics before that really touch the listener like Morrissey does. Johnny Marr is incredible, as well as the other members of this band. After hearing this, I am really happy I bought this. My favorites are This Charming Man and Hand In Glove, as well as others. Buy this album now!
B0000DD7LC|1.0|yo what happened alicia cook. this cd only has like three songs worth listening too which is your three singles. so when you realese another cd i hope it will be fantastic.
B00025ETIW|5.0|I have both cd's and can say that this one is much better then the first.  The new is more mainstream it seems but that makes it better in some ways.  The music is more toned down in this one and sounds much better, the singing is better along with the lyrics and i can listen to the whole cd from start to finish, not one track is bad.  My favourites in no particular order are: <br />- Helena <br />- Thank You For The Venom <br />- I'm Not Ok <br />- The Ghost of You <br />- To The End <br />- Cemetary Drive  <br />- You Know What They Do To Guys Like Us In Prison
B00009ATIX|3.0|I have my doubts whether a novel by a writer as experimental in his style as Stanislaw Lem could be successfully transferred to film, but Steven Soderbergh gives it a pretty good whack. George Clooney is Chris Kelvin, a shrink who is called to investigate strange phenomena at a space station circling an unnamed star (or planet, or something) that are driving its crew nuts. Kelvin's wife, Rheya (played affectingly by Natascha McElhone, whom I hadn't remembered seeing before, though she was in The Truman Show), died by her own hand and he's still grieving -- until she comes back to him on the station. Somehow, the star (or planet, or whatever) creates an environment in which people are visited in their dreams by whomever they want most to see, a situation not conducive to retaining one's proper outlook on reality, not to mention one's sanity. The start of the story is slow and somewhat confusing. That's true of the novel, as well, but a film isn't a book and it doesn't have the luxury of expecting the viewer to be unendingly patient. Once the plot picks up the pace, though, it's really not bad.
1400034779|5.0|I'll keep it brief, since there are plenty of other reviews here, but hands-down, one of the best books I've read in the past ten years.  The prose is pure joy.  The mysteries Precious Ramotswe uncovers in her detective work are wonderful looks inside African culture and the human psyche.  The humor is life-affirming and lovely.  Read this book first, then the whole series.  You'll be glad you did!!!
0425129616|5.0|I've been reading Agatha Christie books now for a few years, and oddly enough, I hadn't read the first in the Hercule Poirot series until a couple of months ago. Even though the Poirot books are my favorites, and I have already read Curtain (the last one in the series), I still hadn't read the first one! <br />This first one gives you a taste of what Agatha Christie always delivers to her readers in terms of emotion and suspense. I've already read it twice, and I think I could read it forever (which is often not the case with mystery novels).  <br />A wonderful lazy summer day read! <br /> <br />
B000002KDO|4.0|\\"Paranoid\\" usually gets more attention but this is, I believe, the best of the Ozzy-era Sabbath albums.  All of them were good(ish) - even the weaker \\"Technical Ecstacy\\" and \\"Never Say Die\\" had their moments, illustrating that this band has never made a bad album, even with all their different lineups - but of the early efforts this is by far the most consistent.  Bill Ward has said that for him this album was the end of Sabbath's classic era. <br /> <br />And heavy?  Of course HEAVY.  Tony Iommi's guitar and Geezer Butler's bass virtually double one another and with both of them being downtuned this is one to rattle any subwoofer (my only real complaint is that Bill Ward's drums sound somewhat flat). <br /> <br />Lyrical content is highly varied, rating from pot-smoking to Christianity, nuclear war to loneliness. <br /> <br />\\"Sweet Leaf\\" - All stories indicate that the cough opening this song is Tony Iommi.  Some state that he had a \\"blast on the pipe\\", others that he had a pull off a joint that Ozzy provided.  Definitely a pot-smoker's anthem.  I don't do that myself, so lyrically it's a bit ridiculous to me but the music is fine, with many trademark Sabbath tempo changes.  I have heard that Ronnie James Dio sang this on his first tour with Sabbath.  It would be almost hilarious to hear that amazing voice singing such a silly song. <br /> <br />\\"After Forever\\" - Christian metal!  All you who paint the Sabs as devil-worshippers, have a listen to this!  \\"God is the only way to love\\"!  Excellent lyrically and musically.  A point of contention is who exactly wrote the lyrics.  The original LP pressings listed Tony Iommi as being responsible for both the lyrics and music.  However, recently stories have bubbled up saying that Geezer had trouble writing lines like \\"Would you like to see the Pope on the end of a rope\\" due to the bassist's Catholicism. <br /> <br />\\"Embryo\\" - Mediaeval sounding instrumental by the ever-versatile Iommi on non-distorted electric guitar.  Again doubled by Geezer's bass. <br /> <br />\\"Children of the Grave\\" - Sabbath classic.  Rumbling Geezer bass intro leads into anti-nuclear song.  The beat is a bit strange, especially given that Ward overdubbed timbales over his drum track.  Creepy whispered fade-out that is great in headphones. <br /> <br />\\"Orchid\\" - Master Iommi is at it again, this time with an acoustic Spanish-flavoured instrumental.  Sounds like it could well be rendered on 12-string guitar. <br /> <br />\\"Lord Of This World\\" - One of the remarkably few Sabbath songs to deal directly with the topic of Satan and the song does not do it in a positive way.  Excellent song and quite heavy. <br /> <br />\\"Solitude\\" - This is by far one of the STRANGEST songs Black Sabbath have ever done.  Not heavy in the slightest, mellow electric guitars, flute (both by Iommi) and Geezer's bass largely carries the melody.  It's been questioned over the years if this is Ozzy's voice.  Ozzy says it is, and, though I am not a fan of his voice, I have to say that this is probably the best vocal he has ever done!  Also, despite the fact that this is not a heavy song, I consider this to be one of Sabbath's \\"doomiest\\" tracks.  Eerie bells in the background that continue right up to the end of the song. <br /> <br />\\"Into The Void\\" - Spiritual successor to \\"Planet Caravan\\", but much, much heavier and very well-constructed.  Ends with some alternate crushing powerchording and nimble soloing. <br /> <br />From here Sabbath would become much more experimental, but they were never again as heavy or consistent during the Ozzy years as they were on \\"Master of Reality.\\"  Essential!
B00018D44U|5.0|This is a great CD. Natural, robust and tender when it needs to be. Norah has a unique country-jazz blend that works perfectly for her voice. <br /> <br />She must be doing something right... she got Diana Krall to change her style, phrasing and orchestration to imitate her! Only Norah can do Norah though!

B00003CXCT|5.0|This new DVD set has not been released yet. One cannot \\"review\\" films one has not seen, so any negative reviews of the new versions are pre-mature at this point. I intend to revise this review once the new DVDs are released to give my opinion on the set at that time.... however....  <br /> <br />The man who gave us the incredible works we know as \\"Star Wars\\" is the creator. He alone may revise, restructure, redefine his works as he wishes. He is a highly intelligent and imaginative man who would not \\"molest\\" or \\"destroy\\" works he so lovingly created for generations to come. He is seeking to improve the quality of the visuals for generations coming forth after we are long gone. The original Star Wars was ment to be part of a saga..... and the first episode (actually now the 4th) was made 27 years ago. In order for the saga to now come full circle, he almost had to seem the 6 films together. Next years release is episode 3.... and it needs to tie into episode 4 as seemlessly as possible. He is doing that in subtile ways with this new edition.  <br /> <br />Secondly, I own this trilogy on VHS and there are obvious gray frames around the spacecraft, grainy cover-ups under the landspeeder, and other flaws that they did not know how to correct in 1977. Today, film makers can digitally clean up the flaws and even add difficult scenes that could not have been made 10 or 20 years ago that were originally intended. I agree that studio bosses and producers should not be allowed to mangle films considered classics.... but this is a director and the man who gave us STAR WARS in the first place. If it were not for him, we would never have these films at all.   <br /> <br />Perhaps some are upset these films may be altered so that they do not \\"conform\\" to THEIR idea of what Star Wars should be. Trouble is, I have not met too many fans of these films that agree on their \\"hidden meanings\\" and metaphors.  <br /> <br />\\"Not proper to change these classics?\\" Give me a break. In classical music, many famous composers changed, reorchestrated, updated and provided new transcriptions for their works. Bach, Bruckner, Debussy, Ravel, Telemann, Handel and many others altered their own works and new \\"versions\\" were published. In the case of Bach, his \\"harpsichord concertos\\" are performed on piano now... the piano did not exsist in Bachs time... they are still masterpieces. <br /> <br />Let's see the films and then see how they work for us. My gut feeling is that I am going to love them..... as I am going to love \\"THX 1138\\" coming on September 14. As long as it is LUCAS giving me his revision, I am fully trusting these films I have loved for so long are going to look even better.
B00005JN2X|1.0|This movie was boring, pointless, and plotless. I can't believe people are giving this movie the highest amount of stars. Tom Cruise looks ugly, and Jamie Foxx has the most disgusting flavor saver on his face. Not only does riding in a taxi suck, but movies about them do too. And as a New Yorker, I can tell you that the chance of getting an English-speaking cabbie is rare, as well as a clean cab, along with a nice driver. In a totally braindead movie, the only good thing about this movie is that it ends. I looked at my watch several times, as well as 2 trips to the restrooms. I almost fell asleep. There was like zero action and the previews tell the whole story. Don't waste your time or your money on this movie.
B000001AFY|5.0|By 1976 Soul Diva Diana Ross had a river of No.1 hit titles, Movies, Television Specials and spectacular Concerts to her credit.  <br /> <br />However Ross hadn't had a major chart hit since 1973's divine classic, Touch Me In The Morning. Black music was steering into different directions with Soul music divulging into Disco and in some aspects Ross' recording career had lost course.  <br /> <br />That changed in 1975 when the classic Theme From Mahogany (Do You Know Where You're Going To) catapulted to the top of the charts. This epic ballad with its sweeping musical arrangements and an almost dreamy yet compelling performance from Ross was written and produced by the genius Michael Masser. The track really is a masterpiece and that classic interlude at the climax of the song is breathtaking. For some odd reason, Theme From Mahogany was not nominated for a Grammy Award despite its cross-Atlantic success though after strong protest it was deservedly added yet still failed to win. Even so, Theme From Mahogany rightfully remains one of Ross' key classics and became the opening number on this excellent 1976 studio LP.  <br /> <br />Diana Ross had an uncanny and effortless flair for ballads and nobody could quite convey such warmth and genuine emotion as she could. I Thought It Took A Little Time (But Today I Fell In Love) is another example of her unique expertise. This exotic and exalting ballad is enhanced by Ross' delicate but effective vocal performance and was written and produced by Michael Masser. The track surprisingly faltered within the lower reaches of the Top 40, probably as promotional priorities were suddenly turned to the albums next release, Love Hangover.  <br /> <br />Love Hangover was quickly covered by The Fifth Dimension and issued as a single. Motown was certainly not going to let anyone outshine their leading lady and predictably rushed out Ross' version.  <br /> <br />This exciting, tempo-shifting Disco classic saw Ross effectivley updating hersound. Never before had Ross sounded so adventurous as on Love Hangover. The track, written by Pam Sawyer and Marilyn McLeod and produced by Hal Davis (who she had worked with on her Everything Is Everything album), began in slow, sultry form, a style Ross had become accustomed to over the past few years and then wildly steers direction into red hot, compelling Disco/Funk. Ross sounds almost stark at some points in the recording even delivering a brief impersonation of legendary Jazz vocalist Billie Holiday at one point. That sort of spontaneity was what made Love hangover become one of the definitive Soul/Disco classics of the decade. Love Hangover zoomed into pole position on the charts, subsequently leaving The Fifth Dimensions less ambitious version hovering down the bottom end of the Top 100 BillBoard Charts.  <br /> <br />Kiss Me Now, written by Gwen Gordy and Kenneth Lupper and produced by Motown boss Berry Gordy and Don Costa, is a silly but fun playful Jazz number where she even goes so far as to deliver a brief mimmick of Louis Armstrong at one point.  <br /> <br />What makes this album stand out from a lot of her others of the 70's is that contains a cool blend of sounds and textures and the second half gets even better.  <br /> <br />The soulful You're Good My Child stands as the best of the album tracks. Containing undertones of soft-Funk with a gentle piano backdrop and a warm Reggae beat, this startling number features Ross delivering a rich and compelling performance. You're Good My Child went onto become the flip side of her next hit single, One Love In A Lifetime.  <br /> <br />One Love In A Lifetime is perharps in a way no more than a contemporary updating of her sound and style with The Supremes though the track is instantly infectious despite lacking the initial immediacy of Love Hangover. One Love In A Lifetime jumped to No.25 on the BillBoard Charts though bombed in the U.K.  <br /> <br />Her cover of Ashford and Simpsons Ain't Nothin' But A Maybe, a track she produced herself, has a sassy and sexually charged performance from Ross but once again her flair for ballads is displayed on another gorgeous Michael Masser compostion, After You, where she sparkles too full effect.  <br /> <br />The album then closes on a surprisingly unique version of Smile to which Ross excels herself, delivering a strong, passionate performance. Produced and arranged by Gil Askey (who had worked with Ross on several projects including the soundtrack to Lady Sings The Blues), Smile does show Ross' rather understated and over-looked versatility.  <br /> <br />The Diana Ross album gels nicely together, partly as more effort seemed to be put into it than some of her other studio efforts where some like Last Time I Saw Him (1973) were flawed by mediocre \\"filler\\" and B-sides. This pleasing effort from Ross was actually conceived as a full studio project. Released in February 1976, this classy soul package became one of Ross' best sellers of the 70's, jumping into the Top 5 Albums Charts on both sides of the Atlantic as well as deservedly winning many favourable reviews from critics of the day.  <br /> <br /> <br />Ian Phillips  <br /> <br /> <br />  <br />
B00006RINF|5.0|take my word-this cd is amazing. it has seldom left my cd player since i bought it. also, consider getting the 2 disc edition. it has beautiful acoustic versions. Lacuna Coil kicks Evanescence's ass. I don't think they're even all that similar, but since people seem to be comparing the two, i'm stating my opinion.
0425188809|5.0|This is by far Koontz's finest, a terrifying book that stands out almost as much for its humanity as for its scares.  Unlike most horror novels, Watchers focuses a lot on characterization as its protagonists attempt to build new lives for themselves--while being stalked by a killer monster, of course. <br /> <br />Watchers tells the story of a loner outdoorsman and a loner young woman who are united by a strange dog they call Einstein.  Einstein is so named because he is brilliant, easily as smart as a human.  That's because Einstein was genetically engineered by the military, and escaped from imprisonment in a secret lab. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, Einstein wasn't the only thing to come out of that military lab.  He is pursued by a monstrous creature known only as the Outsider.  The only thing the Outsider hates more than its own hideous appearance is Einstein, and it is bound and determined to kill the dog--and anyone who gets in its way. <br /> <br />Following the Outsider--and Einstein--is an FBI team led by a strangely sympathetic character, considering that he represents the shady government.  Altogether, the tale is an engrossing one, though it is not without flaws.  For one, Koontz crams too much into the novel.  There is also an insane hit man who also wants Einstein; it seems like he ought to have been cut out and saved for a possible sequel, for his involvement makes the story too cluttered, and the resolution to his conflict seems rushed.  Also, Koontz sometimes forgets he is telling, at heart, a horror story; for a large section in the middle of the book, the Outsider is completely absent and the character interaction almost gets too in-depth, seriously hurting the pacing of the novel... though he makes up for it in the finish. <br /> <br />Despite its flaws, which are minor at worst, Watchers is possibly the best book Koontz has ever written, and definitely one of the scariest.  I highly recommend it to any of his fans.
B00028FDRA|5.0|I wrote a review for the other version of Comalies, the one without Disc 2, even though the one I have is this one. disc 2 makes me happy. that's all i can say. Lacuna Coil is amazing.

B00028HBKM|5.0|I can't believe all the absolute tripe I've seen here about this film being \\"snuff\\" or \\"lame\\" or \\"trash' or \\"just a bloodfest\\" Those people do NOT get it at all! They're treating this like any other \\"movie\\" this is an experience. I saw this film the day it came out and it just made me realize even more the extent of what Christ freely bared and endured for love of me AND YOU! People put this film down and put Mel down because of the blood, WELL what did you expect? FLOWERS? Come ON people! Why don't you pray the way of the Cross during Lent or pray the sorrowful mysteries of the Rosary, which this film is a beautiful, real, living, moving version of. It's not the blood that makes it beautiful to me at ALL, you see .. What makes it beautiful is truly greater love than this haveth no man. Yes, Christ's torture was violent, YES there was blood, YES his crucifiction was brutal and painful to watch but that doesn't make the film trashy and whatever else people have said and is not anti-semitic in the least.

B0001AVZA8|2.0|You will enjoy this movie ONLY if you're a rich older rich woman who enjoys living in a safe fantasy world, far from contact with reality.  In short, if you're a 50 year old rich \\"chick\\" who's afraid to come out of her \\"shell\\", this is the chick-flick for you. <br /> <br />The rest of us should go elsewhere for our entertainment... for example, \\"As good as it gets\\", also starring Jack Nicholson, is romantic, devoted to gritty realism, and displays well-rounded, deep, 3-dimensional characters. <br /> <br />\\"Something's gotta give\\" is a bland sugar-pill placebo.  It's a flat unfunny comedy with flat, unbelievable characters in every manner of idealized settings from New York to The Hamptons to *gag* Paris.  All the people in this movie are unreal rich, successful, gleaming-toothed, unoriginal stereotypes.  They live in a perfect world where nothing hurts, nothing's real, and everybody comes out happy. <br /> <br />For example, a 30-something single doctor in the Hamptons who looks like Keanu Reeves (Heck, he IS Keanu Reeves) feels no pain or regret at being dumped by his fiance, and is single and available for Diane Keaton. <br /> <br />Everyone drives a (product placement alert) BMW.  All the relationships are shallow, devoid of chemistry, and needlessly prozac-laden. <br /> <br />Dialogue lacks any sort of magic.  I can't recall a single line of this film despite having seen it just a week ago.  <br /> <br />Give it a miss.  Go for something at least halfway committed to realism, witticism, and 3-dimensional characters.
0618526412|5.0|This book is huge.  I approached it with skepticism.  Half way through the book, I wasn't wowed. Then while I was telling somebody else about it, it dawned on me how deep the characters and the story had grown.  It's a coming of age story for a whole town and one young girl.  Every character is so natural through the story that a rich diversity of music, politics, philosophy, and religion is subtly and radically revealed.   <br /> <br />Mick Kelly's experiences at her \\"prom\\" and the swimming hole, her relationships with her siblings, and obsession with music provide a parallel for the life of each other person.   A deaf-mute as a focus to share a secret with each character was inspired.  We're all individuals in the same boat.  The abrupt last sentence of Part 2 is brilliant.   <br /> <br />It's a simple story to enjoy with plenty to discover and digest throughout.

0316776963|4.0|I just finished this book and I thought that it was great-entertaining, funny, and unique.  David Sedaris has certainly led an interesting life, even if at times you are left wondering how he managed to get off of drugs and survive a bout of less-than-satisfying jobs (mover in Manhattan, personal assistant to psycho rich lady, apartment cleaner).   <br /> <br />His family's bizarre idiosyncracies are hysterical and telling.  I especially like the story about his sister fulfilling her life-long dream of wearing a fat suit and his father's obsession with hoarding and eating all kinds of food whose shelf lives have come and gone.  <br /> <br />The stories about France are funny as well, though some of they seem a bit too cliched and typical-the hateful French teacher, the challenges of learning a new language, the unbelievably uncouth and ignorant American tourists, etc.   <br /> <br />Overall, I would definitely recommend this book if you are looking for an easy read that will make you laugh.  David Sedaris is a great storyteller who is able to chronicle the ups and downs of his life with humor and wonder.

B00005JMEW|5.0|Many people on Amazon would disagree with the <br />title \\"masterpiece\\", finding the over-the-top blood and violence to be too much and unnecessary. Whatever your opinion Tarentino is undeniably a cinematic genius. His knowledge/love of martial arts/samurai movies is clear, and the man knows his stuff. I am not a fan of old kung-fu movies and still pick up references in the movie that point to his paying homage to a genre he is knowledgeable within. I saw Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, both great flicks, and the patented style is again used to tell this story. <br /> <br />Kill Bill Volume 1 begins as a woman known only as \\"The Bride\\" has been beaten and shot to near death. The ones responsible--The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (of which the Bride was a former member) and Bill. Bill was her boss and also the father of her unborn child. A massacre ensues when the Bride is about to marry another man, but the killers made one mistake--not killing the Bride. Even if I didnt tell you this you would figure it out very quickly---The Black Mamba (the Bride's codename) WILL get her revenge. <br /> <br />This movie gets some negatives from people for being so violent and at times sloppy. Tarentino had that vision and it couldn't have worked better. Blood unrealistically sprays when limbs are chopped off which of course is exaggerated almost to a comedic level but not quite. The question is did Quentin pay homage or rip off the genre? The answer is he has ripped off elements to an extent, but told the story in the way Tarentino does. He combines traditional elements of Kung-fu and adds his style to give us nothing more than a superviolent revenge flick. It is a damn good one at that. To say he has blatantly ripped off everything is far-fetched. He has a deep love/appreciation for Samurai movies and he knows what he is doing here. He truly wanted to leave his mark on the genre and the result, Kill Bill is one that will stick around for a long time. I was literally amazedat what I saw the first time through and it is just as fun a ride the second, third, etc. times watching it. <br /> <br />This has been said and I will say it again: if you can't stomach the violence and blood to the extreme do not watch Kill Bill. If you are a Tarentino fan it is your duty to see this great movie. If you arent a fan give it a shot anyway. With so many styles, including Anime, this is a stylish, yet violently unrelenting epic that will be remembered. Watch the movie for what it, a story of a woman screwed over who deserves revenge against those who took the most precious things from her. Dont dismiss it as a bad movie because you don't like profanity or gore. Then question yourself as to Tarentino's brilliance. All that aside this is the best movie I have seen so far in '04 and I cannot wait to see Volume 2.  <br /> <br />The picture and sound quality are very good on this release, with a Dolby Digital Surround track and a DTS track for those who have the capabilities to hear that. Only negative I can give this dvd is the lack of extras. You just know with a movie like this one there is so much more out there as far as bonus material goes. As for me, I am happy to own this great movie and I recommend you to at least see this movie, if you can stand violence that is.
0312995423|1.0|I would give this book 0 stars if the system allowed.  It is that bad.  Had I read this book first, I would never have read the rest of Dan Brown's books.  I enjoyed \\"The DaVinci Code\\" although it too was filled with many historical errors that were easily overlooked and did not distract from the story, this book was just poorly researched and written. From the undeveloped main characters to the thin plot line, this book became one that I put down often as it was unable to hold my attention for any length of time.  I found myself (my spouse did the same when she read it) skimming over the text looking for something that was just not there.  The last 20 pages or so were just a blur of indescribable babble. <br /> <br />Without giving away any of the plot, if there is one, let me throw out some of the really bad things that made my grey matter quiver.  First, two really intelligent main characters (she with a 170 IQ) who couldn't find their place in the story.  If this were a movie, people in the audience would be yelling at the screen \\"Look out, the killer is right behind you!\\"  The setting - Fritz Lang meets Dr. Strangelove.  I really hate it when an author tries to bend truth to make the story work.  For example, when the power goes out in the Crypto center there doesn't seem to be any sort of emergency lighting installed. Well duh my author, did you ever see those little battery boxes with lights on them over every exit door? They are required by law in every building constructed since Sherman redid Atlanta.  Foreign Nationals with a known history of hateing the USA, working, evidently without supervision, in a top secret 'Umbra' installation. A sprinkler system protecting a billion dollar computer system? Hope those weren't government plumbers who did that installation. Burning computer chips that give off oxygen? Did my science teacher have that wrong 50 years ago? A fire so hot it melts steel but leaves the female lead unharmed? I haven't seen attempts at plottwists this bad since those old movie serials back in the 1940's and 50's. <br /> <br />Sorry Mr. Brown, I would have to say that if there is an ultimate code in this book, it is the one between authors and professional reviewers who give any book put in front of them a \\"wow factor\\" and claim the author to be the new Tom Clancy. I should have taken a clue from the first review in the paperback, written by David Pogue, \\"..._and if Dan Brown's gut-churning story were any realer,...\\"  What the heck is 'realer' anyway?  <br /> <br />Pass this one up. Don't waste your money. Save a tree or something. Wait for the next Clancy or Cussler. <br /> <br />Ron Rutherford
B00005JMEW|5.0|Tarantino teams with Uma Thurman to invent one of the coolest characters I think I have ever seen in any movie to date. 2003's \\"Kill Bill\\" is one of the best films of this year if not of all-time and it's a damn shame that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences is too conservative to realize how great it is.  <br /> <br />Uma Thurman stars as \\"The Bride\\" (her real name is actually bleeped out whenever it's uttered) and she's pissed as hell. She is a former assassin apparently on the verge of getting married after running away to restart her life after discovering that she is carrying her boss's baby...only her boss, \\"Bill\\" (David Carridine) finds out and sends her former teammates to gun her down at the chapel...but wait, that's just the beginning of the story. And it's brilliantly retold, short and to the point, in a grainy black-and-white two-minute sequence at the film's introduction. Bill is yet to be revealed. All we hear is his voice; soothing, yet dark and foreboding...and all we can see is The Bride's pained face as she lies on the floor, sweating profusely and bleeding to death. She tries to tell Bill that she is pregnant with his child and it's cut off by a bullet to her head.  <br /> <br />If you are trying to make sense of anything I have told you thus far, don't. If you think I've given too much away, I haven't. You see, The Bride WILL kill everyone she has set out to kill because that's her motivation. Thurman's character is practically invincible with the skills of the greatest martial arts fighter in the world and the momentum of a Mac truck. It's HOW she kills that provides you with surprise and suspense. And if you're thinking that this is a self-indulgent gore-fest with no plot, you're very much incorrect.  <br /> <br />The Bride is smart and cunning and you identify with her cause. More so, I would imagine, if you were a woman watching this movie. In fact, you can't call Tarantino sexist or mysoginist because almost every female characterhe writes is intelligent (save for Bridget Fonda's character in Jackie Brown, but Tarantino adapted the character from the book, so that doesn't count) and has the ability to play on the same field as men. In fact, Bill's entire staff of killers, save for Budd, is a female so, technically, this is a chick flick but a chick flick lovingly dedicated to a group of women with their arms held aloft with pride and conviction and Uma leading the charge with a sharp sword and a bad attitude.  <br /> <br />Like Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, this movie is presented in \\"chapters\\", making it feel like you're watching a great epic novel come to life in front of your eyes. Each chapter introduces a character, or a backstory told in different types of media. A few examples of this: The Bride's death is recorded in black-and-white as if you are watching history unfold, O-Ren Ishii's twisted origin is Japanese hardcore hentai anime, and characters fight in silhouette against giant screens that, at once, turn red, then blue.  <br /> <br />These are truly epic moments told with truly epic style and fashion with giant doses of wit and flair added for good measure. An example is one of my favorite exchanges in the film is between The Bride and O-Ren after The Bride has mowed down O-Ren's gang of fighters (nicknamed \\"The Crazy 88\\"):  <br /> <br />O-Ren: \\"Silly caucasian girl likes to play with samurai swords. You didn't think it would be that easy did you?\\"  <br />The Bride: \\"Actually, for a second there...yeah...I kinda did.\\"  <br />O-Ren: \\"Silly Rabbit...\\"  <br />The Bride and O-Ren (at the same time): \\"Tricks are for kids...\\"  <br /> <br />Or the soft-spoken and very solemn bragging coming from master swordmaker, Hatori Hanzo (Sonny Chiba of \\"The Street Fighter\\", one of Tarantino's favorite martial-arts films):  <br /> <br />Hanzo: \\"This is my finest sword. Should you encounter God in your travels, God will be cut.\\"  <br /> <br />The humor injected into each scene makes the fightsfollowing them seem all the more deadly and enticing and dramatic. Swords ring and slice, knifes cut through the air, bullets boom, women spit venom into the word, \\"b***h\\" whenever they trash-talk, and the blood...oh, yes...I did forget to mention the gallons upon gallons of blood, didn't I? Violent? Well, I still defend this film against those who say that violence is only justified in films regarding religion, mainly because while this movie is violent, you're really not supposed to be taking it seriously. I find it hard to believe that when someone gets a belly-full of sword, then has that sword removed from their belly, that all the blood they carry flies forth as if the stab-victim has a pressurized water cannon readilly installed in their stomach. It's violent...but it's outrageously violent and in that way, that is where the movie gets its charm. Sure, it's pretty dark charm, but it's charm nonetheless.  <br /> <br />The great amount of detail that Quentin Tarantino has applied to this film is unbelievable. He borrows from old Sergio Leone westerns, 60's martial-arts movies, action films, anime, and great sweeping dramas. The only genre that Tarantino leaves untouched is the movie-musical and science-fiction although, one would suspect that if Tarantino had enough time, he would cover those, too. I could almost imagine Tarantino ressurecting the acting career of Mark Hammill and casting him as a hip alien who tries to kill The Bride for killing Bill, a friend of his.  <br /> <br />How good is it?  <br /> <br />Remember that part in \\"Once Upon a Time in Mexico\\" by Tarantino's good friend, Robert Rodriguez, when Johnny Depp tells Antonio Banderas that he is so crazy for the pork dish he is eating that when he is through, he is going to walk into the kitchen and shoot the cook?  <br /> <br />Oh yes, it's that good, but I'm not shooting the cook 'cuz I want more.  <br /> <br />**** out of ****
B00008WG3U|4.0|Classic NOFX with a few songs about current political matters.  I always respect someones right to express there opinions...though punk voter almost seems to force there opinions \\"we're not telling kids who to vote for\\" on kids.  Reguardless, this is a really good album.  I liked pump up the valuum a little better, but I'm pleased that old dudes can still crank out bitch'n tunes like they do.
B000089RVX|5.0|I Love this CD! Evanescence is so band of the year (in my opinion) Goth or not Evanescence will always be one of my fav. bands! Amy Lee has one of the best voices I have ever heard, This CD has an awesome sound and well-written lyrics.    Evanescence Rocks Now and Forever
B0002HTZJI|5.0|You have to hand it the Chili Peppers, they have been staying busy enough to keep their fans happy. They usually wait a few years in between each album cycle, but since By The Way was released in 2002 they have released a Greatest hits album with a DVD and two new songs, a concert dvd, a live show CD and John Frusciante will have released seven solo albums this year alone (yes, seven!). Hopefully their next CD out will be a new album, but I'm happy for now.  <br /> <br />As for the actual CD, its awesome. Ever since I watched Live at Slane I have been dying for a live CD. I have no qualms about the setlist. Some people prefer early Chilis work, others prefer the later stuff (but I guess no one prefers their evil middle child CD One Hot Minute). I like the Chilis from beginning to end and appreciate that they are one of the few bands left today that keeps on evolving and changing, a sign of only true musicians who actually write their own music.  <br /> <br />Does anyone know what is the Live in Hyde Park listing on Amazon that is going to be released on August 23rd and costs 53 dollars? I might feel a little cheated if its a longer and better set than the already released version, but I think I'll eventually pay for it anyway.
0156027321|5.0|Martel is a brilliant storyteller - intelligent, funny and sensitive. I couldn't put it down and laughed till I cried reading the exchange between Pi and the Frenchman; apparently this was shortened dramatically in editing which is a shame, as for me it was one of the best bits. Still, one of my all time favourites, can't recommend it highly enough.
B00005JKHP|5.0|A statement, which was in the first episode to air, that holds true in this DVD Director's Edition.  Vulcan looks great, linking Amok Time to The Search For Spock.  This Film is my favoite, believe it or not.  And now that they fixed up the continuity, it's much better than before.  Now they just need an explanation for why the Klingons, in Enterprise, have ridges . . .
B00023BLXK|2.0|Poor imitation of the original. I quite liked the first Dirty Dancing but this doesn't even compare. Story is pretty boring and unless you are a teenage girl, this won't interest you much. Add the leading man who is a skinny kid and looks about 12, and the usual chanting of \\"Revolution-good! Capitalism-bad!\\" and you have the recepe for a something you don't want to bother with.
B0002A2WDQ|4.0|I'm sure the only reason most people are interested in this film is for the duel scene. Most of the movie leading up to that point needed alot more polish. The concept behind this film is very interesting but I think the film itself really does a poor job of storytelling. There is very little evidnce of the main characters talents up unitl the duel scene. I think it would have been a much better film if there were more musical challenges along the way instead of a love intrest that consumed a good part of the film and then lead to nothing. I also think the film would have been better off with more flashbacks of Robert Johnson rather than just the one scene at the beginning. <br />Alot of week points in this film but the duel makes it all worth it I guess.
B0002DKCMG|3.0|I enjoyed this movie, but my friends overhyped it to me.  I politely disagree with them that it is not as good as Road Trip or Old School (the two movies mentioned on the box of the dvd).  Its got hot girls everywhere, but theres no real talented comedic acting like Ferrel, Vaughn, Green, and Scott provided in the movies I mentioned above.  The script was above average, there were a few good laughs, but a lot of lagging in between.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie, but the 5 star reviews are not accurate.
B00004RFFS|4.0|It was in development hell for over a decade and then there was the whole debacle over Cruise as Lestat and River Phoenix popping his clogs and Brad Pitt stating the filming as the worst experience of his life.  Then there was Cruise shrieking about the homo-eroticism being too much (from the man who made locker room love Top Gun this is bizarre!) and so on. <br />By all accounts, it should have been a disaster, but thanks to a great director, cinematography to die for (scuse the pun), staggering sets and an extraordinary cast, IWTV stands up as one of the best vamp films ever. <br /> <br />Yup, the book is better, but as far as translating to screen goes, a lot of the narrative tries to be faithful.  Let's face it, if it followed the book, we'd have been sitting through a lot longer film!   <br /> <br />Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise are two of my most disliked actors.  Yet Cruise's smarmy grin is perfect for narcissistic Lestat, all the pomp and splendor and ego of the character isn't much of a stretch for Tom... And Pitt's pretty boy looks and peculiar way of talking strangely ends up exactly as I had always pictured Louis.  He may have had a rotten time filming, but as it seems to have given him the chops to turn Louis into the tortured anti-hero, I'm very glad it wasn't all chocolate boxes and roses for the fellow. <br /> <br />The muted colours of New Orleans and Paris are stunning and quite decadent, with tinges and splashes of red throughout reminding us what flows throughout the film.  Apart from a couple of dodgy looking backdrops, the sets are fairly staggering scale wise and lend brilliantly to the telling.  The effects, the teeth, the veins and the iridescent eyes, are wonderful (making the Buffy cast look like they've been mucking about with modelling clay) and give the vampires a natural (rather than full out preternatural)look to remind us that the Dark Gift really isn't about turning into bats and wolves, but being anchored to the earth by the cruellest means possible. <br /> <br />The falldown is Armand who, with Antonio Banderas looking rather embarrassed to be sloping about candlelit dungeons, is not at all the angel-faced, auburn haired charmer I'd hoped for.  But the relationship between Dunst (Claudia) and Pitt more than makes up for this little disappointment - the full thrust of the grown woman in a child's body and the horror of it is excellently portrayed.  The hair chopping scene is quite, quite jarring and Louis's discovery of her body sums it all up. <br /> <br />IWTV has a rubbishy end for the book lover, but ties in neatly if you think about it.  All in all, this is a wonderful telling of a very difficult novel and if you can look past the missed bits, this is rewarding viewing.
B00003CXIY|4.0|This movie lived up to its hype of ruanch and laughs.  Its not on the caliber of Old School or the first American Pie, but it does a damn good job.  The dialogue in this was much smarter than some would expect for a gross out comedy.
044100590X|5.0|It's about time this modern classic became part of the secondary school curriculum. Hey, maybe some forward-thinking teachers have already introduced it into a classroom. So many of today's authors and filmmakers have been influenced by this book, it seems rather retrograde to ignore it. Rite of passage, societal obligations, moral ambiguities--it's all in there, and, in my opinion, is a much more worthy work than some of the material I was forced to read in my HS years.
B00005JM1F|5.0|How Old School is at 3.5 star average is beyond me.  I really don't think Will Ferrell will ever be able to top Frank The Tank.  There have been plenty of raunchy comedies over the past few years, but this one had a script that blows the others out of the water.  Definitely better than Europtrip, Club Dread, Road Trip, and the American Pie sequels.
0060930187|4.0|This book is not so much about plot as it is about character. That's my humble opinion. <br /> <br />Plath's character Esther is the focal point of the story. It is told by her point of view. The book details her descent from a editorial prize from a famous magazine to her fall to a mental institution.  <br /> <br />The book works on many level. Any girl, in fact, anyone can relate to Esther's fall to depression because everyone has, once in their life, had a moment of depression or loneliness or isolation, etc.  <br /> <br />In fact, I'm sure, many of you  know that this book semi-autobiographical of Plath's own life. <br /> <br />And I'm sure many of you know the comparison to Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye to this book. But it is different, though I give both of them 4 stars. It's different while Holden deals with his contempt for human behavior, this is more of a detail description of a person's fall to depression. <br /> <br />The fact is Esther could be anyone. This book is a quick read and worth the effort. If you have time, it won't take you more than two days. <br /> <br />The reason I gave this book four stars is because I, myself, could not relate to the main character. Throughout the novel, I felt myself pitting her. It's not the book, it really is me. That's the main weakness of the story. While most people are use to the main character triumphing at the end, there is none of this. Depression isn't an easy battle to win and the book leaves us kind of empty. The author loathing for herself is overwhelming. Everyone has their moments, but very few of us are completely absorb by it.
B00005JMEW|5.0|It's become pretty well known through publicity that this is Tarantino's fourth film, so how does it rank up against his others? Well, as much as I love Reservoir Dogs, it hasn't dated too well. Especially when compared to Pulp Fiction which basically became a classic the year it was released. He followed with Jackie Brown which was (in my eyes) a great movie, but others disagreed. After a six year hiatus from directing, America finds out that Tarantino's next movie is going to be a revenge flick centered around a woman who was left for dead on her wedding day (even though it turned out to be dress rehearsal). I wasn't exactly thrilled about the idea of the man doing a straight-action movie, but all doubts were thrown out the window during the first frame of Kill Bill. The Bride lays there helpless; crying; bloodied up. The audience doesn't know exactly what happened here, but it becomes obvious when we hear Bill ask her, \\"Do you find me sadistic?\\" The Bride's shot in the head and the credits immediately pop up with that haunting song on the soundtrack.  <br />\\"The 4th Film By Quentin Tarantino.\\" <br /> <br />It was then that I realized that Tarantino had not \\"sold out.\\" Not even one minute into the movie yet and it's already flooded with the style of filmmaking he's known for.  <br /> <br />I absolutely adored this movie. It's the most exciting action saga to come out of Hollywood for quite a while. Some might call it trash, but it's smart trash. Technically, the film is a marvel to behold. Tarantino loves what he does and it shows in every frame of the movie. He does plagarize a few things here and there, but the cues work so well that someone who appreciates the art of filmmaking won't mind at all.  <br /> <br />The script is terrific, though some argued that Tarantino was a bit stingy with his infamous dialogue in this particular volume. I'll agree with this to a point. The dialogue in his movies is simply cool and one of the main reasons I enjoy his stuff so much, but the lack of it in Kill Bill doesn't hurt the film one bit. Here, it's mostly about the craft of making a movie that excites the audience but doesn't cater to the lowest common demoniator by dumbing the material down. In fewer words: lack of extensive dialogue doesn't hurt the film.  <br /> <br />The characters are a hoot to watch. Thurman plays the Bride straight-faced; the only way to do it. You don't even see David Carradine as Bill in this one too much, but in Volume 2, he's a wonder to behold. A true scene-stealer. Doubt the Academy has the balls to nominate him for a film like this, though. Lucy Liu is the somber, yet deadly, O-Ren Ishii. The character is fleshed out in a gloriously violent anime segment and isn't tossed off as \\"just another bad guy.\\" The character of Go-Go Yubari, however, is just one of O-Ren's cronies. But, for want of a better word, she simply rocks. Definitely my favorite secondary character of the series. Sonny Chiba also makes a funny cameo as Hattori Hanzo, creator of the Bride's \\"steel.\\" <br /> <br />So, is this Tarantino's best movie yet? In my opinion: yes. If you love movies, see Kill Bill. Both volumes. As much as I loved Volume 1, I think Volume 2 is even better! <br />
B00006690G|5.0|This records has to be one of the top 10 albums ever made. Eminem is the best rapper there is in the rap industry right now because he has the ability to make ANY song work even if the beat were to sound like crap. These beats are pretty good, but what makes a song are the lyrics, and Eminem is without a doubt the best at providing those. He brings it in every song except maybe \\"Drips\\". This album is EXCELLENT. He says so many things that are true and there's just no one better. If your'e a rap fan and you don't have this album, then you should feel embarrassed and ashamed.

0316666343|4.0|I bought this book in Germany because I had run out of books to read and I desperately needed another \\"plane book\\" (by the way, books are INCREDIBLY expensive there) and I bought \\"The Lovely Bones\\" because I had heard people talking about it and thought that the plot was intriguing. <br /> <br />Bad idea to start reading it on the plane. I was physically nauseated by the crime (though that is not a criticism, it was necessary to set up the rest of the book) and started bawling in the  plane... the people sitting next to me definitely thought I was a little crazy. <br /> <br />However, after I got over Susie's disturbing death (though the romantic side of me has to admit that I was disturbed even more by her mother's adulterous behaviour, not because I didn't understand, but because the father had truly loved her), the book was a little easier for me to digest and I actually liked the ending, contrary to what other people were saying. <br /> <br />The part where [SPOILERS!] she 'falls back down to earth' was a kind of relief for her and for the readers and I have to confess that while I've only read the whole book once, i've read the earth-section more times than I can count. <br /> <br />It's a great read...delves into some serious issues, but that's what life is.

B000002OX7|5.0|Who's Next(1971). The Who's Fifth Album.<br /><br />After 1969's 'Tommy', The Who's breakthrough success Rock Opera, Townshend and The Who went back to the studio to record 'Lifehouse', a Rock Opera with Sci-Fi influences(much like Rush's '2112'). Unfortuneatly, after a writing block and lost ideas, the ambitious project came to a grinding halt. Fortuneatly, many of the tracks that recorded are still captured on The Who's 1971 critical and commercial smash, 'Who's Next'. Although The Who drafted another Rock Opera in the form of 'Quadrophenia', 'Who's Next' is a collection of unconnected songs, yet somehow it comes off as more ambitious than 'Tommy' and 'Quadrophenia' to most Who fans and critics. Upon its release, 'Who's Next' became a hit, scoring hit radio singles \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\", \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\", \\"Baba O' Riley\\", \\"Bargain\\", and John Entwhistle's \\"My Wife\\". \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" even reached #15 on the US Top 40, and all those tracks get airplay to this day, showing 'Who's Next' is undoubtedly The Who's most popular album. With Daltrey's sarcastic sneer to his caring whimper, Moon's rythmic drumming, Entwhistle's legendary bass, and Townshend's intrepid mixture of synthesizers and electric guitar, The Who were ready to rock! So, is 'Who's Next' an undeniable classic, or an album that falls short of its legendary status? Read on to find out!<br /><br />Track Ratings-<br /><br />Baba O' Riley- 'Who's Next' begins with an emotional, teenage-angst filled hit, entitled \\"Baba O' Riley\\". Townshend's upbeat and groundbreaking synth line gives way to Daltrey's passionate vocals and Townshend's electric guitar flourishes. A passionate rocker that won't fail to please!<br /><br />Bargain- Right off the bat, \\"Bargain\\" unfolds between Townshend's rip-roaring acoustic guitar beat and Daltrey's teasing vocals. \\"Bargain\\", a cross between a ballad and hard rock, still remains a classic today.<br /><br />Love Ain't For Keeping- \\"Love Ain't For Keeping\\" is a melodic Rock song, typical of The Who's 60's material, infected with pop melodies. Daltrey's vocals work well here.<br /><br />My Wife- John Entwhistle's \\"My Wife\\" finds Townshend and Daltrey molding a sarcastic and humorous melody about husband's problems. Oddly, the use of trumpets and Daltrey's vocals mix well, and \\"My Wife\\" is a fun rocker that hits the spot every time.<br /><br />This Song Is Over- \\"This Song Is Over\\" shows a lighter side to The Who, capturing a jazzy, soulful keyboard flourish from Townshend, and Daltrey's vocals positively bleed optimism. Townshend's guitar playing doesn't disappoint, and neither does the band, picking up the song mid-way through to create an excellent song.<br /><br />Getting In Tune- Much like \\"This Song Is Over\\", \\"Getting In Tune\\" starts off with a light-hearted keyboard beat behind Daltrey's touching vocals, but picks up enough to mold an impressive keyboard-driven rocker.<br /><br />Going Mobile- \\"Going Mobile\\" is a classicly underrated masterpiece, and this song could easily be a hit. Townshend blends a catchy acoustic guitar riff and touches of synthesizer while Daltrey dishes out a vocal performance, to the point of even imitating car noises! A fun rocker that'll raise your blood pressure!<br /><br />Behind Blue Eyes- The Who's hits typically don't revolve around ballads, yet their biggest hit, aside of \\"Who Are You\\", is the undeniable classic \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\". Townshend's hopeful, sweet acoustic-driven riff backs up Daltrey's vocals, which, to put it simply, are phenomenal. His range and depth is amazing, from his piercing confessions to his rebellious tone at the end. When this song picks up to the amazing finale, if you're not amazed you're probably dead!<br /><br />Won't Get Fooled Again- The Who's biggest hit(judging from charts), is a synthesizer driven rebellious Classic Rock song that still remains a Who classic. Daltrey's well-known sneering vocals and the Who are in top-form here, and this barely misses \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\" as the best track on 'Who's Next'. Simply beautiful guitarwork and choruses that will make you want to revolt!<br /><br />Pure And Easy- The original song conceivedfor 'Lifehouse', \\"Pure And Easy\\" combines a sweet, innocent acoustic guitar melody mixed with Daltrey's joyous vocals. If you like melodic hard rock, this song will rock your world!<br /><br />Baby Don't You Do It- \\"Baby Don't You Do It\\" combines the infectious 60's Rock/Pop sensibilities that made The Who famous, not to mention infectious guitar chords and vocals that almost echo back to Elvis.<br /><br />Naked Eye- \\"Naked Eye\\" echoes back to \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\", except after its slow start it picks up considerably to become a Bluesy Hard Rock song with an excellent virtuoso guitar performance from Townshend.<br /><br />Water- \\"Water\\" is one of the strongest tracks on 'Who's Next', blending a catchy, upbeat beat from Townshend and Entwhistle, not to mention vocals from Daltrey that sometimes verge on sounding like James Brown! What really makes \\"Water\\" great is Townshend's virtuoso guitar performance, as he solos and fingers his way through 7 strings with ease and technical brilliance.<br /><br />Too Much Of Anything- \\"Too Much Of Anything\\" is a typical Who ballad, blending an innocent, sweet acoustic guitar riff with Daltrey's remorseful vocals, yet \\"Too Much Of Anything\\" keeps original by adding in Country/Rock influences that make it a solid track.<br /><br />I Don't Even Know Myself- \\"I Don't Even Know Myself\\" starts off with a brisk harmonica medley, yet that sets the mood for the whole song, a catchy but experimentive rocker. Daltrey sings with a flair that can only belong to him, and Townshend plays a mean piano, using a style originally conceived by performers in Old Western pubs. An odd yet fun track!<br /><br />Overall, 'Who's Next' is a definite triumph for The Who, yet, as many others think, I wouldn't say it's their best. Townshend would gradually broaden The Who's style and music from this point on, adapting synthesizers as a main instrument. Like you'd expect from The Who, 'Who's Next' dishes out flawless Classic Rock, Hard Rock, Ballads, and Melodic Rock songs, so if you're a fan of any of those, I suggest you try The Who out. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!s that will make you want to revolt!

B00005YW4H|5.0|I AM NOT REALLY A BIG FAN OF HER MUSIC. HOWEVER, IT DON'T SHE CAN' SING. I'M JUST NOT INTO THE MUSIC. I RESPECT NORAH BECAUSE SHE IS CLEAN, AND DOESN'T TRY TO BE LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.SHE HAS A UNIQUE VOICE, AND I AM GLAD  SHE WON LIKE 8 GRAMMY'S FOR THE ALBUM. GET IT, IT IS GOOD FOR PEACEFUL MUSIC!!!!SHE IS PRETTY TOO!!!!!
B000069AUI|5.0|This is one cd that I always listen to when I want to hear something relaxing. There are only a couple songs that I skip but their other songs on here are so good that it makes up for it. I would recommend this to any type of music fan.
B00006879E|5.0|Maroon 5 kicks ass, i just started listening to the cd a couple of weeks ago and normally im not into this type of music, but this group has changed my prespective.They've got alot of potential to reach the top. Their music is very influencial, not like a cheesy boy band whos trying to fit in. their music is easy to listen to and fun to sing alot with. i LOVE maroon 5 and reccomend this cd to everyone, by the far the best song would be she will be loved, its soft but has a catchy tune to it. go for it and try it out:)

Author McCall Smith continues to develop the characters and situations in this series which is set against the backdrop of Batswana.
B0002IU988|5.0|This is one of the best rock CDs that I own.  I have been following Alter Bridge since I heard that Creed broke up in June.  I can tell you that Creed was and still is one of my favorite bands.  However, Alter Bridge stands alone by themselves.  I am amazed at how well Mark can play guitar.  I thought that he was excellent already, but this album proves that he has topped himself.  I also think Myles has an excellent range and voice, but some of the \\"ooos\\" and high notes can be anoying at times.  I admit, it took me a while to get used to the singer, being that three of the guys were in Creed and I am used to Scott Stapp's voice.  There is not a song on here that I do not like.  Highly recommended.
B000002UAX|5.0|Some people have little too much time on their hands.  If you like the beatles, you'll like this album.  If you don't, you won't like it.
B00005YXZH|2.0|Okay, I get what's going on here, the static and other annoying sounds are supposed to simulate a radio broadcast. Big deal! Taking average songs and adding annoying sounds to each track doesn't make them extraordinary.
0393035158|1.0|The review dated August 9 does a far more detailed critique than I am willing to undertake, and admirably addresses the failings of this book.  As stated, this is a book best chosen by those looking to indulge in an articulation of their own views, but it inevitably fails to provide even that.  In addition to being inconsistent within his own established guidelines of secularity, Mr. Harris is, quite frankly, a little scary.  <br />     Rather than looking for ways to deny our Creator's existence through the active solicitation of errant philosophies, potential readers would do far better to turn with an open mind to such works as The Purpose Driven Life by Rick Warren or, for a really fascinating read, The American Prophecies by Michael D Evans.  Our loving Creator waits for you!!
B0002IU988|4.0|ever since watching stapp whine about his tragic relationship with his father(it's called being a teenager)on vh-1 i stored my creed cds.i'm glad the rest of the band saw fit to regather with a new singer. his range is much better and compliments the invigorated guitar playing. on first listen this disc is probably the best new heavy music out. i hope it gets the air play it deserves...spread the word.
B0002IU988|3.0|Open Your Eyes is an awesome song but other than that it's nothing really special. This Myles guy has got nothing on Scott.
B0002T2Z48|5.0|This film is the best and i mean best of it's kind. It's hilariours but also has the serious side to it that dosen't let it down. I love the way the lead girl (elle woods) follows her boy friend just to stay with him, then discovers what her talents really are. It's just a lovely feel good film. For once the critics got it right.
B00005JLEU|2.0|Sorry, but I have to agree with the other \\"disturbed\\" viewer.  The images in this movie are very dark, disturbing and scary, even gory.  I would not recommend this movie for most children under the age of at least 8.  Sensitive children should NOT view this movie.  Although I enjoyed parts of the movie, overall it seemed to me like a very bad dream.
B00006690G|2.0|eminem is an influence to most of us today but this realesage of his was not the best that he could of made it. his material was not as good in the unrealesed singles this time. slim shady should of spent more time on his new stuff before this was realesed.
B000002L7J|5.0|^matt thanks for the title once again hah....like every other review...favorite songs: <br /> <br />Headmaster Ritual <br />That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore <br />How Soon is Now? (like always) <br />Meat is Murder <br /> <br /> <br />oh yeah buy the cd!..check out Moz Marr Smith's...his is killer GO READ! <br /> <br />
B000089RVX|4.0|i love the album and ll the songs on it because theyt are all sooo detailed. the one thing that i dislike is that moost of the songs are ballads. they could of thought up a few different active songs.
B00004ZAV3|3.0|This was the first Beatles album I ever got. Before I was like, \\"The Beatles? Who are they?\\" Don't think this is actually a Beatles album! It's just a collection of #1s, a lot of them being Paul songs. You must get other Beatles albums. Otherwise you will get a not-so-great impression of The Beatles after awhile. Think if they had put \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" or \\"I Am The Walrus\\" on this album!!!!
B00005RFVL|2.0|robbie williams is a fantastic singer and has a great future ahead of him but this album to me was a real set back for him. he took on the roll of a jazzy pop singer and it unfortunatly was not, in my eyes, a good look for the robster. a good album but for robbie's voice it was not the best look for this man. sorry.
B000002KHH|5.0|I'm writing this review as I sit here, thinking of last night because last night I went to Ozzfest, and on the way to and back, I listened to this cd(...)and anyone who doesnt like it should eat sh*t and die. Yeah it's got a lot of popular songs on it, he played 4 of em last night. The guitars, drums, and ozzys singing were still as good as they were on this album, Paranoid. Now people like Frank(ss) think theyre too good for this music just because lots and lots of people like it but Frank, you're stupid for not liking this great cd just because other people besides you like it. And I think we all know that mtv and hot topic have been jamming crap down our throat. So what? I say if it sounds good listen to it. And this cd sounds better than good it sounds great. I strognly recommend you pick up this cd to anyone whos ever remotely liked rock n roll.     P.S. I figured out why Frank has the little (ss) after his his name, its cause hes a nazi.
B00004U8JV|2.0|This movie still stinks after all these years. I remember back in '97 visiting my sister in Arizona and watching this in a theater there... I was like... WHAT HAPPENED!!? And even though I knew what I was buying with this dvd, I bought it for my completist mentality and that's it.    C'mon... I want to like this as much as you do. I really do. No really!! But when you are working off of a pitiful script, actors with ZERO chemistry, POOR casting, and many cheap indoor sets, whatta ya want outta me? Only so much can be salvaged with some superb action sequences and a recycled soundtrack. I enjoy reading reviews here at Amazon especially for products like this that just aren't any good... and they are like 6 paragraphs long as they try to explain away the wreckage, but I won't waste your/our time. Sadly, this is a typical cash in sequel that spent a lot of money on effects... no wait scratch that, not SPENT, make that WASTED.    JP1: 5 stars  JP2: 2 stars  JP3: 3.5 stars (how did the third movie come out better? Mysteries never cease...)    Oh and if you are buying this for the extra's don't bother, the deleted scenes amount to a whopping 2 scenes! WhOoPee!! Gee, why doesn't it mention that on the back of the dvd?
B0000508U6|5.0|Intelligent, beautiful music. This band has got everything to become one of the saviors of rock. With time this album will only increase in value, musically that is. A classic of our time, a must for any collection.
B00000IQC8|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies ever and I dare to say it's better in b&w then it woulda been in color. That's what made it in a category of it's own. Ya can't help feeling sorry for Dante always getting nagged at by his video store buddy Randal and by all of those annoying customers...This movie is definitely recommended to anyone, even kids. It'll teach them never to work in a convienence store.
B00018D44U|2.0|This album is a musical exercise in dullness, no zest here, no vivacity what so ever. I don't understand all the buzz about this girl. She's good, but not in this setting. Disapointing, because here first album is much better.   Warning: Do not listen to this album while driving a vehicle, may induce drowsiness.
0689815816|5.0|This is one of the first books my son responded to.  I could read it to him and get him to say Uh Oh at the proper point.  Months later he was able to add Oh No at the proper point.  A book like this, with fun noises, great prepositional phrases, interesting drawings, a funny storyline, an exciting ending, and a repetitive reading sequence, really help children to remember what's going on.  A kid who can remember a story can eventually learn to tell you that story, and sometimes even do so long before they're truly reading and decoding the words. <br />The board book format will always be lauded in our household.  We like the durability and compactness of the books.  The babies can easily turn the pages, the books withstand being thrown (hey, it happens) and stepped on, and the pages can be gnawed on without too much harm. <br />This is one of our favorites.
0060537639|5.0|I read a report in Chinese that one of the treasure boat will be recovered in China, there are 2 big cannons, 4 smaller cannons, cannon shells, and grenade!! (It seems Chinese invented grenade as well), this will be reported at the end of year. <br /> <br />I think in this book, there are hard evidences, such as Sacramento Junk, there are numerous 'small evidences', but adding all pieces, the story is quite plausible!
0375805613|4.0|We have lots of fun reading this book.  I like to emphasize the strength it takes to turn the page and topple the brick wall, for instance.  It's probably better to read this during the day. At night you want quiet, calm-me-down books. This book is not that. <br />The only reason I docked it a star is because some of the pages are a little harder to read aloud because of the extra pleading and begging that Grover is doing.  Not a great reason, but it's not a story so much as a monologue. <br />I loved it as a kid and my children definitely like it now.  It's filled with interesting plot obstacles (which might make a post-modernist thrilled, by the way) and the artwork is bright and colorful. Some of the words are very comic-booky. <br /> <br />All in all, a fun romp!
0465043550|4.0|\\"...forty years after I started battle on the subject, most economists now acknowledge that prices do not follow the bell curve, and do not move independently. But for many, after acknowledging those points, their next comment is: So what? Independence and normality are, they argue, just assumptions that help simplify the math of modern financial theory. What matters are the results. Do the standard models correctly predict how the market behaves over all? Can an investor use Modern Portfolio Theory to build a safe, profitable investment strategy? Will the Capital Asset Pricing Model help a financial analyst, or a corporate financial officer, make the right decision? If so, then stop arguing about it. This is the so called positivist argument, first advanced by University of Chicago economist Milton Friedman.\\"     Isn't it this positivism that the majority of practitioners of finance exhibit? I myself, though not a practitioner, held such thoughts. My reasoning had been based however more upon majority's acceptance -- if everyone else is acting upon the assumptions of normality and independence, I thought, what good will there be adopting a new theory? Isn't finance more akin to social sciences than to natural sciences after all?     It is these beliefs that Mandelbrot sets out to dispel with this monograph. He does so convincingly with great confidence and tenacity. The book consists of three parts, first the examination of the current theories (CAPM, MPT, Black-Scholes), next explanation of his methodology (fractal analysis), and finally of posing questions that should be answered (Mandelbrot asserts that virtually all the current theories should be reexamined under more realistic assumptions). To readers who have followed Mandelbrot's findings even remotely, there are no new advancements recorded in this book per se. He explains with concepts he developed throughout his entire career -- fractals; more specifically self-similarity, long-range dependence (via the Hurst exponent), and fractal decomposition of [trading] time. Mandelbrot's original research without doubt launched an entirely new field of study in science and engineering. Here his objective seems to be persuasion of the general public that an overhaul of existing methods is due. This may be evidenced by the absence of equations in the main text (some are included in the notes/appendix), and by the existence of the second author of this book.    The book is also a trajectory of Mandelbrot's intellectual development. He explains, with characteristic detail, why, how, and when he has become interested in the problems as he did. The result is interesting accounts of historical figures (Bachelier, Hurst, Markowitz, etc) and records of encounters with eminent figures in mathematics and economics (L&#233;vy, Poincar&#233;, Sharpe, and Fama (his student) to name a few).    There has long been a need for mathematical models that reflect the market more accurately. Should the new models be in form of incremental modifications of existing models or should they be based on an overhaul of the foundation as Mandelbrot proposes? Be prepared to be challenged, if not altogether persuaded, by Mandelbrot's arguments.
0679892478|5.0|We like the rhyme and the storyline of this little book.  We like how the apples just do not look like they could possibly balance another moment.  The drawings are cute.  The competition is harmless.  The counting practice is helpful. this is a fun book that's a great read for toddlers and babies.
B00003CXE7|4.0|Ridley Scott, who directed \\"Gladiator\\", took some of the best elements in classic movies like \\"Ben-Hur\\" and \\"Spartacus\\" (the set designs, the big production values, the man-to-man combats, the huge number of extras), and combined them with modern elements inspired by movies like \\"Braveheart\\" and \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" (the digital effects, the realism of the battles, the man fighting for his country and seeking for revenge). <br /> <br />\\"Gladiator\\" is a modern epic with good performances and good direction work. The cast includes solid actors like Russell Crowe, who dominates his role, specially in the physical aspect where he really looks like a warrior. Richard Harris in a brief but essential role as Marcus Aurelius. Joaquin Phoenix as the infamous Commodus, he portrayed one of the most cynic villains in recent years. Oliver Reed as Proximo, he also gave a memorable performance. <br /> <br />Ridley Scott gave a dynamic pace to \\"Gladiator\\", even though this movie is an epic, its length is shorter than movies like \\"Ben-Hur\\". He also used CGI visual effects in a lot of open camera angles, for example, in the landscapes there are a lot of CGI elements added to the shots. The sound and the music are very good, and it reflects in a more realistic movie. <br /> <br />\\"Gladiator\\" is a very good movie, it's a very good way to introduce younger audiences to a classic genre. If you liked this movie, then you should see the classics, like \\"Ben-Hur\\" and \\"Spartacus\\".
0399230033|4.0|I love to look at this book with my kids.  We like identifying the animals before and after they are busted out of jail by the mischievous little gorilla.  I love the scene where the only thing drawn on a pitch black background is the zookeeper's wife's eyes.  Too cute! <br />It's not really a reading book, per say, though.  It's fun to look at, but there are many pages with no words at all.  I still absolutely love the storyline and the artwork is lush.  i just thought you might want to know.  <br />We also like how the gorilla manages to escape again even after being returned to the zoo. <br />A very fun book, very clever, well-illustrated, and worth looking at again and again. <br /> <br />
0790730960|5.0|This is without a doubt the best batman movie ever made, and one of Tim Burton's best. The story outline and the cast are better than perfect. When i saw the original Batman (1989) in theaters, it was superb with Tim Burton's signature right on it. Three years later, after his fabilous Edward Scissorhands (1990) i sat and watch Batman Returns (1992), which is by far my favorite Tim Burton movie. The make-up work for the penguin is unbelievebale, the music score was even better than the first, and the eerie dark background of it all is just spectacular. <br />      Batman Forever (1995) and Batman & Robin (1997), both of them i sat through in theaters and couldn't stand it, basically sucked. Hopefully Batman Begins (2005) will turn up good. <br />How disappointing though are the dvds. The only thing you get are producting notes, every Batman movie deserves to be in a special edition dvd format; with theatrical trailers, tv spots, behind-the-scenes featurettes, audio commentaries and more. it sucks to see other movies that aren't even have as good as these to be loaded with special features. <br />      Well, anyway hopefully 'Warner Bros. we'll release these Batman gems into special edition dvd format they we're meant to be in someday. I'd highly recommend this movie to any 'Tim Burton or 'Batman fan.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|To anyone out there who's debating on buying this album...the debate must end now...it's a MUST have! His soulful sound and warm voice is something we need more of in the music business. He's a cross of Billy Joel, Stevie Wonders and Joey McIntyre all rolled into one...and let me say that is an outstanding combonation! I promise you will love this CD with just one listen, you won't want to stop listening to it! So go on...buy it and enjoy! :)
B0001AP12G|5.0|Kanye's College Dropout is hands down the best album of the year. His beats are fantastic and so uplifting, and don't be fooled by his so called signature high-pitched soul feel beats, Kanye is diverse, with bangers like Get Em' High and Breath in, Breath Out. Kanye proves he's not only one of the best beatsmiths in the game, but should be up there lyrically with the other living greats like Jay, Nas, Eminem and Scarface.<br />My top 5 tracks:<br />1. Family Business<BR>2. Never Let You Down ft. Jay Z<BR>3. Two Words ft. Mos Def &amp; Freeway<BR>4. Spaceship<BR>5. School Spirit
B0000C6E4D|4.0|I have been listening to Sarah since 1998 and enjoy her music very much.  This is very good stuff.  Mellow, haughting music.  A good CD.
0066620996|5.0|Wow, what a great book.  The amount of research that went into Good to Great is incredible in itself, but it certainly doesn't read like a text book.  The conclusions it comes to are both unexpected but logical, and I think that Jim Collins and his team got it right.  Not only is this a great business book, but is comes off as a great metaphor for life.
B0002IU988|5.0|This is essentially the 4th Creed album that never would have seen the light of day with Scott Stapp still on board. Don't get me wrong - Stapp is a great songwriter in his own right, and between 1997-2001 Creed produced three excellent rock records that will stand the test of time. <br /> <br />One Day Remains, however, provides direct insight into the creative energies, life experiences, and philosophical paradigms of Mark Tremonti. The result is a masterpiece. <br /> <br />Tremonti did some heavy soul-searching while songwriting for this record, as evidenced by powerful tracks like \\"Down to My Last\\", the lilting \\"Broken Wings\\", and the scorching lead metal anthem, \\"Find the Real\\". Myles Kennedy shines throughout, with a graceful, robust tenor that beautifully complements the ferocious crunch-heavy firestorm of Tremonti, Marshall, and Phillips. At times, (e.g. Metalingus, End is Here) the three ex-Creed bandmates collaborate to churn out ultra-tight, synchronistic riffs with even more speed and fury than was found on 1997's \\"My Own Prison\\".  The disc spans almost an hour, each track drenched in melody, greatly enhanced by Tremonti's perfectly-delivered solo adaptations. <br /> <br />This collection of songs might be described as the gospel truth according to Tremonti - with equal parts inspiration, spirituality, and sorrow fused together in a musical milestone - a magnificently rendered rock record. <br />
1567184855|5.0|I have read many books about the afterlife, including Embraced by the light, Life on the Other Side, the Ripple Effect.  But I would have to rate this book to be the best of them.  Because this book doesn't give the views of the afterlife of just 1 person, but the views of 29.  Dr. Newton put these people under hypnosis to talk to their superconsciousness to get details about the spirit world and their past lives. <br />The way I see it, when a person has a near-death experience, their memories of the experience are often filtered by their consciouness.  This often causes the person to have incomplete memories of the experience and can sometimes change certain details.  But in this book, no one is recalling a near-death experience.  They are put under hypnosis and their superconsciousness is awakened.  This provides a very detailed and virtually unfiltered view of the spirit world.  I would suggest to anyone out there, please buy this book or check it out at your local library.  It is very much worth reading.
0316666343|1.0|The only reason I kept reading this book was to have Susie's murder avenged and explained to her family. Which it was not. The characters were unrealistic and unsympathetic.  I didn't approve of Susie using Ruth's body to experience sex, as though Ruth didn't even matter.  Susie made unwise choices in life and death, I suppose.  The writing was hokey, the ending was anti-climatic to say the least, and I cannot understand how this book ever made the Best Seller's list, but then so did The Devil Wears Prada, and that was the worst book I have ever read.
B00008EY65|4.0|Comic book to movie can be tricky but they did this one very well.  Good FX and action, lots of humor. Hope to see a sequel. Someone ought to do a movie on Nazi paranormal projects ... several movies like this one refer to it (e.g. Raiders of the Lost Ark).  Would be an interesting series.
0375703764|2.0|Maybe I'm just not cut out to read such complicated literary devices as this. But, I gave up about 100 pages into the story within a story within an enigma wrapped in a puzzle. Too many layers for anyone who isn't a student in a modern lit class or a professional literary critic.
B00004TWSX|3.0|Even the standard Hollywood Records release is sonically superior to this disc, not to mention MFSL.  All you need to do to prove this to yourself is to compare the renderings of the song '39.  Compare the presence of May's voice, his attack on the guitar strings, and the double bass' impact and richness.  The DCC sound is overly rounded, lacking intensity and life.  The MFSL version has both warmth and impact, without feeling dulled-- it's open and alive. <br /> <br />I've yet to hear the DVD-A version, but I'd assume that too is superior to Hoffman's tubes.
B00005JNJT|5.0|Christopher Nolan is an awesome director, and this movie looks like the best live-action version of Batman to date! I've been following the production of the movie VERY carefully, and I can say that this movie will probably be one of the greatest comic book adaptations ever made. The production designs for this movie rival those of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and I think it's pretty safe to say that this will be one of the most epic superhero films made. <br /> <br />After the disasters that were Batman & Robin, Steel, and CINO (Catwoman In Name Only), it's such a relief to see a DC comics character finally being done with the respect it deserves. Hats off to Chris Nolan and his team!
B0002KVUKM|2.0|I'm also an ENORMOUS fan of the Mummy movies and Universal classics, but this movie definitely lacked their \\"something special\\".  It was ok if you were in a mood to get out of the heat and into an air-conditioned theatre to see a movie, but it can never be considered a cinematic classic.  I walked in all set to be sucked in but the popcorn was more entertaining.  I'm a movie fanatic & normally buy every movie I see on the big screen, but I think this one will just stay on the (Amazon) store shelf.  Sorry.
B00000JCOV|2.0|If you like hardcore metal that doesn't require a lot of thought to listen to, bands who have to wear costumes to make up for a lack of talent, and lyricists who have to constantly swear because they can't put an intelligent sentence together... then you'll love this album. Join the herd... go and buy it!
B0002IU988|4.0|This cd sounds like a Creed and Audioslave cross.  Actually, it's better than Creed and could give Audioslave a run for it's money.  If you like rock, give it a try.  You won't be disappointed.
B0002IU988|5.0|With all of the pop-rock bands emerging as \\"the music of today\\" and the once great nu-metal bands slipping into oblivion, it's refreshing to see a rock band with real talent and great sound  deliver an album worthy of a true \\"rock\\" status. \\"Open Your Eyes\\" is a great single that doesn't sacrifice the intensity of the guitar for catchiness or weak appeal. If you liked Bullets or What If, check out the harder tracks such as One Day Remains or Metalingus. If you liked Faceless Man, One Last Breath, or Pity for a Dime, check out Down to my Last or In loving Memory. Pretty much if you like a hard rock band with the ability to get your head banging and then mellow you out all in one cd, you'll like Alter Bridge.  With a devoted guitarist, a great drummer ,veteran bass player, and new vocalist, Alter Bridge's sound is as undeniably \\"rock\\" as Creed's ever was. With lyrics beyond the norms of teen-heartache or random gibberish, rhythm sections both intense and moving, this band is deserving of much more credit than others(i.e. The Hives, Blink 182, Simple Plan, Yellowcard, etc)
B000021YQV|5.0|This is a very unique album. The Stand Out song for me is chop-suey. S.O.A.D is a very unique band..and i like them..keep it going.
0790731479|5.0|This is one of the movies you will neeed to see twice.  Its dark, weird, and very funny.  I remember watching it over over for its has spirts and newish ideas on the dead world with out being scary.   Must see for all.  Not movie is quite like it.
B0001EBXBK|4.0|Gratuitous violence, witty dialogue, fragmented storylines and one heck of a cast - Kill Bill delivers in typical Tarantino fashion.  I think if I had expected less from Tarantino I would have been shocked into Five Stars - but lets be honest, watch Pulp Fiction, slap in Resevoir Dogs and THEN you too will tell me Kill Bill isn't quite what Tarantino is capable of.  I have to admit I loved it - the spraying blood actually put me in mind of Bruce Campbell - The Living Dead - but I was constantly waiting for something fresh - something groundbreaking - soemthing totally Tarantino - and it didn't come.  Good yes, great yes, the best of Tarantino - DEFINETELY NOT!!!
0736041850|2.0|I love this book because of it's pictures.  It demonstrates which primary and secondary muscles are being workied during various exercises, which is pretty neat.  Other than that, it isn't very useful.  It doesn't provide good routines or workouts that best develop those very areas it demonstrates.  Thus, it's not a good workout book, just a nice reference.  It's nice to have, but not necessary.  Buy it if you like pictures, but don't waste the money if you can only afford one book.
B00005JMUA|4.0|\\"Kill Bill Vol. 2\\" is the perfect union of action, drama, and black comedy. Compelling, fleshed-out characters and over-the-top violence (after all, swordfighting isn't the most common way to settle a dispute these days) make this movie an amusing, moving, and memorable watch -- and a true cinematic accomplishment.  <br /> <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is not your typical sci-fi series! The show has excellent characters and the dialogue brings the show to life in a way that other sci-fi series can only dream of. In short, buy the dvd, you will love it!
B0002IU988|5.0|Even without the success wave of Creed behind these guys, the band's new album is great! Forget Scott Stapp, Alter Bridge is a new chapter...a new band with new ideas, and a good one at that. Alter Bridge is great!
B000059XUI|4.0|the Man of Steel defeated Lex Luthor and saved many lives including his love Lois Lane, but the fight for truth and justice continues in 1980's SUPERMAN II, This time Superman wishes to sacrifice his earthly powers be Lois' loved one, but it's at time when people need him, the three criminals, General Zod, Non and Urza from Krypton have escaped from their imprisonment in the Phantom Zone after Superman inadvertally released them when removing a bomb into space. They come to Earth to bring violence and power to American cities and only Superman can defeat these villians with the same powers as him. The late Christopher Reeve reprised Clark Kent/Superman, Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor, Margo Kidder as Lois Lane, Jackie Cooper as Perry White and Terrence Stamp as General Zod. It's a spectular, entertaining and even powerful sequel that's as good as the original, III and IV, I hear are not to good. Christopher Reeve is terrific and Terrence Stamp makes a cool super villian as Kryptonian traitor General Zod. It's a high flying, thrilling film that was still Superman as he should be. See these Superman 1&2 before this Summer's Superman Returns. He is the greatest Superhero of all time in my opinon. \\"Come to me Son of Jor El\\" \\"I believe this is your floor\\"
B00009P1O5|4.0|I remember when this first came out on record, I bought myself a copy right away. I was kind of disappointed at first, this one to me has to grow on you. All my friends that had it or heard it also had mixed ideas about it, it was so different than his past releases. I have never been into (grunge music) before, and I am still not. But I don't mind this so much after all these years, so I bought a cd copy of it. It's not as bad as what I remembered, but I still find the lyrics weak. Overall this is a fair effort for the time frame, one thing for sure David Geffen sure didn't like it. At the time Neil recorded this to help finish his contract, but that is good old defiant Neil. So Geffen sued him for putting out what he thought was garbage, I don't know if he won the law suit or not. This is why I love Neil, Since Geffen didn't like it he did, very cool dude.
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|The coolest thing to come out of Scotland ever. The bass pounds and the guitars slash allowing hipster and geek alike to shake it efficiently. \\"Matinee\\" sounds like the best song The White Stripes could ever do, and the single \\"Take me out\\" has a cool intro that melts into the now famous groove. You'll get freaked as the album starts out with an acoustic guitar intro on \\"Jacqueline\\" that is the calm before the sound storm. The best vocals can be heard on \\"Come on home\\" and throughout the album the vocals are always perfect, never stiffiling the groove. So dont stiffle your inner groove. <br /> <br />essential tracks - \\"jacqueline\\" \\"Matinee\\" \\"Michael\\" \\"Come on home\\" \\"40 ft\\"
0060012218|5.0|Geography Club was a daring book to write.  I applaud Hartinger for treating the lives of gay youths, typically such a political hot potato, with the dignity and complexity of which they are so routinely deprived.  This will be a landmark book for a generation of young readers.  I would recommend this book to all people, but especially to high school students, parents, and teachers.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I do not like Jane Austin books. I read several and was bored out of my mind. Now, having said that I absolutely adore the movies that are based on her books. I guess I just like the stories but not her style of writing. This is a great love story and since I like Ciaran Hinds this was very enjoyable. However, if you don't like long movies and english accents, I advise against it.
B00003CXXI|5.0|this movie was just wonderful and both my sons have totaly enjoyed it and are still enjoying it.
B00008K9Z5|5.0|After discovering Linkin Park in 2000, I was hooked. Hybrid Theory was a great album and so was Reanimation. Meteora just made them my favorite band of all time.<BR>Here's the review:<BR>1. Foreword: 12 seconds intro for the next track<BR>2. Don't Stay, 8/10: Great guitars, and great scratching. Chester's voice is great in the verses. The vocals in the chorus keeps it from having a 9.<BR>3. Somewhere I Belong, 10/10: Great song inspired by &quot;In The End&quot;. The rapping mixed with the singing is great, the chorus is awesome, the drumming at the end is awesome.<BR>4. Lying From You, 10/10: Rapping in the verses, singing in the choruses, Chester's voice is just incredible in the chorus.<BR>5. Hit The Floor, 10/10: Great rapping by Mike, the screaming hook of the chorus is awesome.<BR>6. Easier To Run, 8/10: Great song<BR>7. Faint, 10/10: My favorite song of the album, everything in it is fast and/or loud.<BR>8. Breaking The Habit, 8/10: Different from what they have ever done except maybe &quot;My December&quot;.<BR>9. From The Inside, 9/10: Great song.<BR>10. Figure.9, 8/10: Okay song.<BR>11. Nobody's Listening, 9/10: Mainly a hip-hop song, the Japanese flute sampling is great.<BR>12. Session, 10/10: The &quot;Cure For The Itch&quot; of this album, excellent track, the scratching is awesome.<BR>13. Numb, 10/10: Excellent song, great lyrics, great vocals. Even the rock haters love that one. It's a great song to end the album.
B000002UAU|5.0|The Beatles were reviled at first, before the public grasped how talented and permanent the Beatles really would become..Parents called them unruly Mop Tops, a passing fad..Before they became the musical icons they are today!..How did 4 poor white chaps from Liverpool literally rule their musical times?..They practiced, and practiced: in dingy dives like (The Cavern), then went abroad and made their musical bones on marathon sets in Hamburg, Germany playing before smashed, knife wielding, merchant marines..First off, you've got to grip how smart and witty John Lennon truly was..He had a natural, acerbic gift of gab, like the time at Albert Hall he told his royal audience, you can clap if you like, or if you're rich, like the Queen, you can just rattle your jewelry..And was very sure of what he believed..\\"The Love You Take, Is Equal To The Love You Make\\"..But the \\"big brother, little brother\\" internecine rivalry between Lennon and McCartney fueled the prolific songwriting..George Martin said Paul was a melody man, borderline mushy..and Lennon was noir, an introspective story man..A lethal, bittersweet combination, obviously..Collectively, they were a warpspeed hit factory..Wrote the lyrics to \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" on the movie set, in fifteen minutes, and considered it a throwaway song..George Martin, the Fifth Beatle, said Paul wrote, \\"I have to admit it's getting better\\", and John countered with \\"It couldn't get much worse..That was their personalities, their colloborative styles, their differences..Paul was \\"Hey Jude\\", to Lennon's \\"Nowhere Man\\"..\\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" is still the best CD by the Beatles ever, because it just raised the bar for the entire musical universe..When Brian Wilson first heard \\"Sgt. Peppers\\", he told his Beach Boy compatriots, we're obsolete..Then of course, Brian swung his own haymaker right back at the Beatles with \\"Good Vibrations\\"..See what I mean, by elevating everyone else's game..Buy \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\" with delirious impugnity..It's the most compelling Beatles CD ever..Clap if you like, or just rattle your jewelry!..It's an Unforgettable \\"Day in the Life\\" of Liverpool's Mop Topped Mozarts.
0393035158|5.0|The End of Faith is a devastating criticism of religious irrationality -- one which is very timely given our current situation in the world.  It is also an eloquent argument for a reason-based spirituality and ethics. I was moved to write a review for this book when I went to Amazon to buy the book for a friend and saw that one review (\\"some caveats\\") quoted Harris out of context, making him seem like a bloodthirsty wacko.  This is so far from the truth, it is hard to believe we both read the same book. It just goes to show that no matter how meticulous, thoughtful, and detailed an argument is, someone can always quote an author out of context and distort his message.   <br />  <br />The author, Sam Harris, is clearly coming from a place of genuine concern for both the current suffering of human beings and their inevitable future under the influence of religion. He does a brilliant job of boldly addressing an issue that has, for far too long, been ignored and tiptoed around.    <br />  <br />I commend the author for his accomplishment and hope that it has the effect of initiating a conversation in a culture that applauds it's freedom of speech, yet remains almost entirely mute on such a powerfully influential subject. I highly recommend \\"The End of Faith\\" to all readers.
0385504209|1.0|Friends lent this renowned book to my wife while we were visiting them.  We knew we were in for trouble when the book told us not once but twice in the first few pages of the \\"renowned curator\\" of the Louvre, as if we didn't get it the first time.  Rather than prose and plot that should be renowned, this novel serves up cliche after cliche in a grating, clunky style, as well as broadly-drawn caricatures like \\"The Bull\\" rather than actual characters.  Even the religious claptrap that has brought this book the opposite of renown in some people's eyes is rehashed mumbo-jumbo.  While a book of this quality would bring renown to an eighth-grader who managed to put it together, it is simply embarrassing that an adult would write something like this, and even more embarrassing that other adults would buy it.  Boring, tedious, and stupid, this book should be renowned for its badness.  If ever there were a print version of Mystery Science Theater for books, surely the Da Vinci Code would be the first one subjected to the MST3K treatment, which would finally be something of renown associated with this book.
6305313687|5.0|I first saw this movie on TV when USA aired it a few years ago, I thought this movie was really good. They did alot of great acting and although the movie is about racism I believe its a good movie because of the realism.
B0000AUHOH|4.0|Sure the special effects are lacking, but this movie has heart,something lacking in the Next Generation movies and new Star Trek series. After 15 years this movie should be rediscovered and put with pride in any Trekker or Non-Trekker's collection.
0743216458|5.0|I happened to watch the DVD series for this book first which prompted me to go get the Stephen Ambrose book.  This book then prompted me to read several of his other books. <br /> <br />Ambrose's big thing with his WWII histories is brotherhood, comradery, and the dependency the soldiers had to have on eachother.  This whole book is basically about transforming a group of men into a group of brothers.  You get to learn the quirks and the nuances of some of the men as the same names appear over and over again (obviously). <br /> <br />But it is still a history at it's heart and reads more like a history book than a novel.  As long as you're okay with that, and as long as you know that Stephen Ambrose has been proven to be a plaigerizer( :( ) then you'll still LOVE this book.
B000024D4R|5.0|This album falls in to the category of \\"The Top 20 Albums\\" I wouldn't mind being stranded on a desert island with.
B0000000LI|4.0|I am a blue collar, rock and roll guy. I'm not the typical yuppy, new aged, birkenstock wearing soccer dad. NOW~ I will say this album is outright fantastic. It's a plus for people who know and appreciate music. If you can get past Yanni's looks, the music is LARGE, and awesomely dynamic. This guy has a ton of talent. I fully reccommend this CD  ONLY IF you appreciate music. If you're a narrow minded, slack-jawwed neanderthal this one is way beyond you.  <br />         ~~Go Get it~!~~~
B00006L7XQ|5.0|...for those who loved Johnny. <br />Recorded just months before his death, and obviously with his life and his passing in mind, this is an amazingly powerful album that invites the listener to walk through the door of the heart and soul of Johnny Cash. His rendering of Bridge Over Troubled Water, sung with his daughter, will move any parent. And the story of the last song...We'll Meet Again, the old WWII song, sung with those with whom he lived and worked...well, it's pure Johnny Cash, at peace with himself, leaving a message for the rest of us. If you loved Johnny, and have an overriding faith that in the end, all will be well...this collection will be far more than just an 'album.'
B0002IU988|5.0|I LOVE this record man!!! Great stuff! The singer, yes, sounds like Cornell at times. That's not a bad thing either. I really liked how he's not afraid to grab his balls and hit those high notes. Nobody else is doing that. <br />Tremonti... WHEW!!!! This boy brought it on this disk! I was very pleasantly surprised. He puts Slash's guitar work with Velvet Revolver (another record I was looking forward to, but was VERY dissappointed..) to shame. I can say with confidence that I enjoy Alter Bridge more than I do Creed. This is Tremonti at his peak. Soak it up people. Awesome BAND, awesome SONGS, awesome ALBUM!!!
0786852550|5.0|I picked up this book wanting to hate it, as I do most HarryPotter spinoffs. However, this multi-factured story transported me to magical parralel world with characters (namely... Bartimaeus) so unique to anything I've ever read before. The book takes many unexpected and daring turns and with Bartimaeus narrating half of it, keeps you laughing throughout the darkest events. Jonathan Stroud is an amazing story teller. I wish he would release more in the States. I'm so glad I read this- it's the best book I've read up all summer!
B00006AW2S|4.0|Solid 4 star rating, 5 star in original mono. <br />&#62;Due to manegement 'Official' DECCA top snobbery, The Rolling Stones were directed to leave many good tracks on the editing room floor.  All their first 4 U.K. Lps were in mono.  It appears that DECCA finally gave in and authorized Stereo, but only after DECCA (Got Some) Satisfaction, then The Rolling Stones got something to roll, nah not 'that', try Rock 'N ' Roll! <br />&#62;For coverART, check out the new abkco &#34;Singles&#34; box sets. <br />Much original mono tracks, and ps coverART only found on ebay.
B0000246S6|5.0|German choir director Bruno Kittel (1870-1948) occupied a leading place in Europe during the first half of the 20th century. His 'Kittelsche Chor' was founded 1902 and soon became renowned as one of the best choirs in the nation and even in the entire Europe. Kittel is also known for his work with conductors Oscar Fried and Wilhelm Furtwangler (the Berlin 1942 edition of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is a robust performance that also includes Tilla Briem). Notwithstanding limited sonics, the 1941 recording of Mozart's Requiem is a moving account; heightened by elite-status choral singing and by the masterly orchestral control of the Berlin Philharmonic, the tableau is not complete without the very good--and sometimes impressive--soloists. This album discloses a trailblazing account of Mozart's justly famous Requiem. Kittel's is a classic reading of this masterpiece : Power, tension and the heavenly sense of a tragic era, but not without an unmistakable mozartian temperament. Kittel also produced some Bach, including a very good version of the StMatthew Passion--of which some excerpts are to be found here. This recording of the Requiem is meaningful because it is one of the first studio recordings (maybe the very first) of the work. It also documents music making during the nazi regime. The somewhat somber light of the work is well reflected by this performance, and despite the precarious quality of sound we do hear a certain amount of details--enough so, i can assure, to enjoy this momentum of sensational musical memorabilia.
B00005JMUA|5.0|sorry to all you action buffs out there, but kill bill vol.2 is the very best tarantino flick ever!   what a great story, what terrific acting by all, i could go on and on-kill bill vol.1 was very entertaining-but almost no story line   part.2 is sheer brilliance; i loved it-together they are the sum of all parts, i guess-but part 2 is and will be honored as a cinema masterpiece!  bravos to all involved.

B0002IU988|1.0|.....that Scott Stapp wasn't the only thing that stunk about Creed!!!  That guitar sound?  Horrid.  Those arrangements......are these guys over 15 yet?   Grow up!!  Those guitar solos.......horrid.   No TASTE, not an ounce of subtlety ....this guy is a terrible guitar player!!!!  That oh so played out mid tempo \\"heavy\\" drumming....my god, how boring a human being do you have to be to enjoy this kind of music??   <br /> <br />The new vocalist is slightly less of a mimic, but he's still doing a 90's grunge \\"thing\\" that has been tired for a LONG LONG TIME!!
B000002MIF|5.0|After hearing the excellent debut album, I was eager to pick this album up. I knew I wouldn't be disappointed, and you will not be either! The Smiths have dropped my jaw again. How can these guys make such fascinating work like they do? Johnny Marr is spectacular on this album, especially with the BBC sessions. And Morrissey certainly deserves some credit, along with the other band members. Will their next album be just as good, or even better? Buy this album now!
B000002BBY|4.0|Every review I've ever read about this group and/or album mentions a connection between Oasis and the Beatles and how Oasis is either a)a tribute band or b)a complete rip-off, and I think that's complete crap.  Critics should stop trying to make Oasis into something they're not, the Beatles, and let them be who they are, Oasis.  Of course they've been influenced by the Beatles, every single band in the last forty years has.  But that doesn't make them some kind of cover band.  The only thing that Oasis is and ever will be is Oasis, that's all.
006097625X|5.0|Recently, I have started to be a fan of webcomics, and my boyfriend, a long-time comic reader introduced me to this book. I read it in less than a day, and was amazed at how little credit I was giving to this artform, as well as the even littler credit others were giving it.  When I finished, I immediately read the sequel: Reinventing Comics, then went to the comic book store and had a good browse around.  I would suggest this book to anyone interested in literature, visual arts, and combined medias.  Read it!
B00005JMAH|5.0|Harry Potter and friends continue their magical journey at Hogwarts while bedeviled by Harry's old enemy - or is he? Adults can indulge their inner child while kids learn valuable lessons about friendship and loyalty. Highly recommend!
B0002IU988|5.0|Thank You Alter Bridge for bringing music back!!!! These guys should get respect all over. There debut CD is simply AMAZING. There new vocalist(Myles Kennedy) is stellar. He can hit every note and really rips. Tremonti will always be a guitar legend, well should be anyway,Brian's bass is thundering and Scott's drums, well listen to the album and you'll find out....Long live Alter Bridge!!!!!
B00006RINF|5.0|I love this cd so much, I bought this cd a few months ago and it has hardly left my cd player. All the songs are unique and I can't think of any song on this cd that I skip over. If your tired of the evanescense (I forget how to spell it) crap, check out Lacuna Coil.
B00004LN16|4.0|AC/DC after 25 years of dishing out amazing Rock and Roll songs prove that they still can Rock and Roll. Stiff Upper lip realesed in 2000 is not AC/DCs best album but it is still very good. The better songs on the album are stiff upper lip, meltdown, safe in New york city, cant stop rock and roll and give it up. I would say these songs stand out as the best songs while the rest of the cd is about mediocure. If you are a die hard acdc fan like I am this is a must, but if you are just getting into acdc, buy back in black or let there be rock first. <BR>Peace out AC/DC Rocks!
B0002IU988|5.0|I have listened to this cd through a couple of times and each time it's more amazing. I was a big fan of Creed until their second cd came out, so I've been looking forward to hearing the band minus stapp. I disagree with the Chris Cornell remarks though, I'm a huge fan of Cornell..through soundgarden, temple of the dog, his solo cd to audioslave..and I don't understand the comparisons..other then they are both great singers. If you want a good band that sounds like Cornell singing check out Thornley..if you want a awesome rock band, check out Alter Bridge.
B000065FMG|5.0|IM tired of people making fun of britney. She is the best performer in the world and by far the hottest. She does amazing song like Im a Slave for you which is incredible. I would also like to point out that the song outrageous on her cd in the zone is awsome. Way to go britney you rock!
0440237688|5.0|I had to read this book 5 years ago and it is still the best book I've ever read. I own over 600 books and this is still my favourite!
B00008WT5M|5.0|The Razors edge, released in 1990 is an absolutely awsome CD. I am a huge fan and have almost all of there albums and I will tell you this cd still ranks in the top 5. Its got great songs like thunderstruck , fire you guns , Money talks , rock your heart out , are you ready, shot of love and got you by the balls. For the big fan or for someone looking for a taste of ACDC this is an absolute dandy. Peace out  ACDC Rules
0385659806|5.0|Read this one.<br />This book blew me away - that's all that needs to be said.
B0000UMD00|3.0|Personally I dont care much for this cd however next to Britney Spears Pink is the hottest pop star in the world. Britney is the best and has way better music so stick with Britney.
B0001LJCPC|5.0|I think that the big thing with Quentin Tarantino is that he knows how to use music to play into the film.<br />With many movies music is filler, something to acompany a scene or two, and then later sell a &quot;soundtrack&quot;.<br />The moment Vol1 opened up with Nancy Sinatra's opening of Bang Bang, you knew it wasn't going to be an ordinary soundtrack.<br />Even watching the credits roll in Vol2 (I usually stay for the credits in all movies.. never know what they'll throw in at the end)he manages to keep you entertained with Malaguena Salerosa which is just a beautiful Spanish song, then ends up with Urami Bushi the trumpets make you just want to turn the volume WAY WAY UP, it sounds SO good.<br />This is  music that you'll never hear on the radio in North  America, and may actually introduce you into something new.<br />No matter what the costs, this and Vol1 are two soundtracks worth owning.
B00005JN2X|1.0|Michael Mann is out. Strike 1 was the Insider. Strike 2 was Ali. And this was Strike 3. The man can't make movies. Heat was bad too.
0393035158|5.0|In this bold, insightful, and sometimes humorous book, the author makes a well rationalized argument against religion and encourages us to question our perceptions of myth and morality.  It is incredibly well argued, articulated and referenced and inspires contemplation as well as passionate debate.  Not only does this book have an intellectual impact on the reader, I've found it has an emotional one. After the author sets forth his argument, he concludes the book on a surprisingly optimistic note, offering viable alternatives for a more loving, compassionate future. It is an absolute must read for all freethinking individuals.

B00005JLEX|5.0|Well... I have got to say it.  Finally A DVD that I can call one of a kind.  This is not your typicval DVD but the greatest TV show ever made or put on television.  I am not kidding when I say that.  For those of you who agree with me you know why you get a \\"holy shit\\" this is special type feeling when you talk about the memories from years past and recite lines to friends that also enjoy the show.  The show just kept getting better and better each and every yeaar that it was out, too bad it had to end.  Thank you Jerry, Larry and Sony, keep the DVD's rolling out as quick as you can release them.<br />Cheers,<BR>Brett
0780020685|1.0|I finally bought this movie after reading so many good reviews, but i was again mislead.  After the dissapointment called Ran, i thought Kurosawa was a pretty bad director that being one of his newer movies.  But after reading so many good things about this movie i couldn't resist.  I sat through this 3 and a half hour long movie this morning, and when it was over i was still waiting for the so called breathtaking battle in the rain.  Anyone looking for good samurai action DO NOT BUY THIS.  All of the action is terribly choreographed, all of the action sequences involve people running around like crazy people, and then maybe one or 2 bandits get stabbed or shot  with a bow or gun.  The last battle was the biggest dissapointment, it was supposed to be one of the best sequences ever captured on tape, what?  It sucks, maybe 50 years ago it was considered an exciting action scene, but by todays standards it doesnt even compare to an animated disney movie in terms of action, really its that bad.  The rest of the movie is taken over by man butts and bad acting, the performances are comical, not funny, ridiculously stupid.  There is no drama at all, when one of the samurai dies I found myself relieved that i wouldn't see that terrible actor again, none of them could even fight or move the sword, not once do you hear the clang of a sword or see any blood, thats right whoever considers this movie violent probably cant handle bambi.  To list all this films flaws i would need more paitence but i will tell you that the action sucks, there is no heart wrenching drama, no humor, not a single good performance, no real samurai fighting like i said you never see someone block a sword or do any kind of move not involving just sticking there arm out and hoping they hit something, the rescue of the kinapped child is 2 seconds long and all the guy does is run in and get the kid, the theft of an enemy gun is short and simple, thats right they run out and grab it you guessed it, the storyis even poorly done, how could anybody mess up a 1 line story, well Kurosawa does, i would not recommend any of his movies he is a terrible director, anybody looking for entertainment can go anywhere else because it has got to be better then this piece of crapola.  In short the last samurai is much better way truer to the way of the smaurai, if you dont think so read bushido, this movie couldn't be more wrong to the way of the samurai, this movie makes them out to be savages and only like to kill and rape women, totally wrong, this movie may have been good a long time ago but anybody younger then 50 will not like this movie, -100000000 out of a 10, i gave it the Negative rating for not contributing anything, no entertainment, esspecially no action because action doesnt get more pathetic then this.  The Last Samurai would kick all Seven of these samurai's asses, but they all died of old age.
B0000029GA|5.0|There is no doubt illmatic is the greatest album of all time.Not even 2Pac and Biggie's albums can top this. This is real hip hop and every track is hot. Thereis only 10 tracks but its too perfect to add anything else. This album is the best inspiring,story-telling, and metophoric album anyone can make. And Nas is still the best, Jay-Z found out after losing to nas in a battle!NO ONE IS BETTER THAN NAS! Everyone should know where real street rhymes came from and most rappers's style came from. Yo, don't forget to get nas's new album and new classic &quot;streets disciple&quot; on september 28!
B000099T3P|5.0|Critters is probably the best post-Gremlins movie about little monsters on the rampage.  In fact, the movie is actually very good.  It's a B-movie and never meant to be taken seriously, but that's pretty obvious just by looking at the cover(and title) of the film.  This is another one you couldn't escape if you had HBO in the late eighties.  What we got is some pretty vicious hedgehog-like creatures(they're escaped convicts) that make it to Earth to basically just eat everybody.  The film focuses mainly on the family of Kansas farmers who get locked in a deadly game of survival with the Critters.  One of them is the always reliable Dee Wallace Stone, who I've always though was as cute as a button.  In the words of Bozo The Clown-Wait! There's more!  The warden from the prison the Criiters escaped from has hired two bounty hunters to hunt the Critters down and blast them to kingdom come(they will be paid in full as usual).  The bounty hunters can change their identity at will, and one of them chooses to be a popular 80s hair rock singer called Johnny Steel.  I don't know why I find that so amusing, but I do.  Does anyone know where I can can that \\"Power Of The Night\\" song he sings in the film?  The movie must have been trying to promote this guy's singing career or something coz that song seems to be the only one any of the characters listen to.  The other bounty hunter can't make up his mind who he wants to be, so he keeps changing.  He spends most of his time looking like the hero's dimwitted friend, Charlie(who would become the only character to appear in all 4 Criiters films).  This movie was made in the days when the PG-13 rating was still fairly new and was alot less wimpy than it is today.  The violence just about pushes the PG-13 rating about as far as it can.  Basically, I would wholeheartedly suggest to you all to relive some fond(or bad) childhood memories by experiencing Critters again now that it's on DVD.
0634049011|5.0|That is how I would describe this book and the teachings of the author. Everything is laid out in an easy to understand format, that takes you from the complete basics all the way up to a complete understanding of the guitar. If I had two more hands, I'd could give the book four thumbs up. ;-D I can't recommend it highly enough.
B00005JL78|4.0|This film is preposterous science fiction which turns into exciting film noir.  But no more preposterous than the recent \\"The Mummy\\" or \\"The Aliens\\" series.  Spielburg says he wanted to create a dark film unlike A.I. and that is perhaps why the numerous science fiction sequences do not necessarily seem as spectacular  at first as they are in \\"The Mummy\\". The first hurdle to overcome is the science fiction, then you can concentrate on the film noir. Downtown D.C. is recognizable in 2054 but the suburbs are futuristic. Particularly noteworthy are the magnetic car system and hovercraft helicopters which float on air, the policemen who can fly, and their weapons, some of which use soundwaves to stun victims and another called the \\"sick stick\\". The Precogs are children of drug-addicted parents and can see murders before they occur; these can be distinguished into red ball (unpremeditated) and brown ball (premeditated). They float in a milky soup which makes their brainwaves easier to read. Detective John Anderton \\"reads\\" the precogs' somewhat disorganized brainwaves by separating them and viewing them on a screen using hand signals,discarding what seems irrelevant,narrowing down the murder in place and time, somewhat like a symphony conductor. There hasn't been a murder in D.C. since the program started; Director Lamar Burgess takes much of the credit for this, and the program is about to become national in scope. <br /> <br />Agatha, the female, is the most intelligent Precog but her mother,Anne Lively, wanted her back at the program's inception since she had conquered her drug addiction.  So Anne had to be eliminated if Agatha was to work for Precrime; Agatha was indispensable to Precrime.  Anne had to be killed without the Precogs seeing it, a risky undertaking. The murder had to appear to be an \\"echo\\" a term  defined in the movie. The main subplot concerns Detective John Anderton and the death of his young son six years prior; he is forced by his unquenchable anger to kill his son's kidnapper in revenge;the Precogs see this murder quite a bit in advance and a federal agent is brought into the case to track Anderton's every move. The bulk of the film and its special effects  concerns Anderton's attempts to escape the police and the federal agent. Anderton's ex- wife also plays a supporting role. Even Agatha can see Anderton's love for his son and \\"all this love in the family.\\"  <br />     Samantha Morton is hilarious  as Agatha. Anderton kidnaps her in an attempt to forestall the murder which he himself will commit. Enervated by her life in the milky soup, Agatha lacks enough muscle tone to walk by herself.The scenes in the shopping mall, where Anderton attempts to evade the police with Agatha's futuristic premonitions guiding him are hilarious, and numerous other scenes are interesting, notably Anderton's eye-replacement surgery, his attempts to evade the eye-scanning spiders underwater in the housing complex, which is cut away to reveal other people making love or having an argument when the spiders arrive to scan their eyes,  and his escape act among the magnetic cars. Notable too, are the wide screen advertisements directed specifically at the viewer, in this case, Anderton.
B00005JMXX|2.0|I watched the movie thinkin thet it was gonna be great for the trailer.... when I was at the theatre, I was hoping for something interesting to happen...ANYHING!!! The effects were great, but the history....oh, no! maybe the DVD version may be better than the cinema version...I really wouldn't buy it. Also, the casting wasn't bad, but it wasn't good, it could have been absolutely better. if you buy the DVD, you really take the risk to be really disappointed! (i'm not joking, it's true!)
B00005JMAH|5.0|Let me say that Cuar&oacute;n did a great directing job.  The kids worked perfectly and their acting was far more better than in the first two movies.  The plot of the movie includes all the main elements of the book and that is great.  The only thing I didn't like is the visual aspect of the movie. Cuar&oacute;n's Hogwarts is not the same from the previous movies.  Sets may be the same, but they are not in the same places as in the other 2 movies.  Costumes are poor and lost their elegance.  Nice touch having Harry's hair all messed up, now it is like in the books.  All this doesn't make the movie a bad one.  Anyway, lucky us that the next director is returning to the original visual aspects of the series.
B00005JMAH|4.0|I love this new director! While Chris Columbus did an excellent job with HP:COS and HP:SS - the third installment of the Harry Potter dynasty is just RIGHT ON the money. Alfonso Cuarzon has wonderfully portrayed the darkness of the third book ... Harry, Ron & Hermione are growing up and the actors are doing a wonderful job of portraying that slide into adolescence from childhood. Daniel Radcliffe has really grown into this larger-than-life character ... and your heart breaks for him as he is trying to make his way through.<br /><br />A few thoughts<br /><br />- The Dementors were scary $#@*. Great job with the special effects people on making them seem so spooky and flowy and ... those clawy fingers reaching around the door at the beginning ... eeeeeek!<br /><br />- Draco is probably the least talented child actor in the group. He just doesn't quite portray Draco as I see him in the book?<br /><br />- Hermione and Ron's romantic hintings were hilarious - the look on Ron's face when Hermione grabbed his hand was priceless.<br /><br />- Richard Harris is greatly missed and he made a fantastic Dumbledore, but Michael Gambon has stepped into the role with no big \\"hiccups\\" - you just accept him as Dumbledore and move on.<br /><br />- I originally didn't think Gary Oldman would be a good Sirius ... but he does have that mix of seeming evil and yet good at the same time. Thankfully we get two more books with Harry having some family that actually cares about him
B00026YO36|4.0|Waited nearly a year for this album to come out(since seeing him in last October, I think.) This latest release from Mark Lanegan is of a different breed than his previous work. The instrument arrangements are more rock oriented (fuzzy guitars, drum machines, distorted vocals, low rattling bass.) No it doesn't sound like any stuff from his work with QOTSA or that of Screaming Trees. Previous [solo] work was slightly more acoustic oriented and seemed a bit more filled out with the sound (besides WINDING SHEET.) The man is ever evolving as an artist. Unfortunately this does not compare to FIELD SONGS, most of those songs are amazing to say the least. Now, in my own humble opinion this album is not complete without the songs from the what was to be the 'sampler' EP, HERE COMES THAT WEIRD CHILL. This quaint selection of SIX songs contains FOUR very good songs including \\"Message to Mine\\" which is easily one of the best songs Lanegan has ever done (\\"Lexington Slowdown\\" is also quite moving.) So, if you like BUBBLEGUM then get the preceding EP.
0440224764|3.0|I thought I had read all of Grishams novels, but then a friend loaned me a bag of books and The Partner was inside. I started to put it back in the bag, and then read the back synopsis and realized I hadn't read it! Somehow I missed it! Ah well -- better late than never. Somewhat reminiscient of The Firm, this book chronicles the story of young lawyer Patrick Lanigan. The story begins with Lanigan finally being found more than four years after faking his death & taking 90 million dollars from his law firm. The FBI wants him, his old law firm wants him, insurance companies want him .... they all want their money and of course, revenge! Unbelievable preparation & planning on the part of Lanigan carry the story along as they handle lawsuit after lawsuit, capital murder charges, divorce papers, oh -- and there's the little matter of Lanigan having no clue where the 90 million is! I think that's really what the title is ... The Partner. Not Lanigan, The Partner at his law firm ... but The Partner, as in Lanigans partner who is the one who is helping him make everything happen.<br /><br />A disappointing ending -- but the last page of a book doesn't change the fact that the rest of the book was an interesting read. It's typical Grisham style - If you liked The Firm, you'll like this one.
B000000WFF|3.0|It's amusing that the Beatles first film, \\"A Hard Day's Night,\\" keeps cropping up when \\"Spiceworld\\" is compared to another movie.  Sure, both movies feature pop groups, but how the Spice Girls could ever be compared to the Beatles is beyond my grasp.  I doubt there will be a 40th anniversary celebration for \\"Spiceworld\\" in 2037, but who knows? <br /> <br />I once saw an old Herman's Hermits movie from way back in the 1960's called, \\"Hold On,\\" which may actually be closer in spirit to \\"Spiceworld.\\"
B000002J03|5.0|This good CD [Btw, great album cover] should have included the ff songs: 'Travelling Riverside Blues' and 'Hey Hey What Can I Do'. Otherwise, a fairly good listen. When I first moved to Canada in 1988 the casette copy was an early soundtrack of my life there. Good songs, great album cover, and good memories.
6304806426|1.0|I finally saw this movie, and wow... it was so unbelievably bad.  It swept the Oscars with nine Academy Awards the same year as 'Fargo' and 'Shine'??  I wonder how much and who they had to pay in order to pull that off.  This is perhaps the most overrated film of all time. <br /> <br />After two viewings desperately trying to see how this was good, it only re-emphasized my thoughts on how the characters were boring, the acting was stagnant and the story just plane and simply sucked.  Also, maybe this was for some kind of an effect, but the make-up of the burned character was so ridiculusly fake that I've seen more realistic make-up in low-budget-B-Rated horror movie.  Also too many subplots infest the plot... non of which I cared the slightest bit for. <br /> <br />Not only that, but being a film student, I kept hearing from professors and other people about how this was an achievement in cinematography. <br /> <br />Huh????  I'm so confused it's not even funny.  The movie didn't even look that particularly great. <br /> <br />Wanna see recent advances in cinematography?  Watch a movie shot by Darius Kondji, Harris Savides, or Matthew Libatique.  Wanna see great acting? There are a million better performances than the ones in this.  Wannan incredibly passionate story?  Even though this is a book, the English Patient is one also, so I say read 'Love in the Time of Cholera'. <br /> <br />This is garbage, and somehow the makers put some magical spell on the vast majority of people to worship it.  And for that I say that my rating for this is one star too high. <br /> <br />To conclude, think about it this way.  This movie is about 2 1/2 hours.  So when counting all the times this has been watched along with all the times it's now being watched and how many times it's going to be watched, the time adds up to hours, days, weeks, years, decades, centuries... perhaps millenia that the human population will have lost because of this horrible movie.  I'm sure someone can find the cure for cancer in that scope of time. <br /> <br />I was an idiot for wasting 5 hours watching this movie twice and now I am kicking myself.  If this review prevents one person from watching this then it was all worth it.
B00005JN2X|5.0|Tom Cruise stars as Vincent, a hitman who has a Taxi driver named Max (Jamie Foxx) drive himto his hits. Tom Cruise is actually at his best when playing a villain just like in Interview with the Vampire. Vincent is a ruthless and heartless killer and no one could play him better than Cruise. Although people are just saying now, \\"look at Jamie Foxx he can act\\". I knew for awhile that he could. Infact he should've been nominated for Ali. He's great in this too as this nice guy who hates this violent situation he's caught up in. He's funny but is also really good at being a sensitive and soft spoken actor as well.<br /><br />  Also good in supporting roles are Mark Ruffalo (13 Going on 30) as a cop who stumbles on to one of Vincent's crime scenes. Jada Pinkett Smith has good chemestry with Foxx eventhough they only have small scenes together. She plays a lawyer that Max picks up one day and they get along so well that she gives him her business card so he can call her. Collateral is suspenseful and has lots of violence but just like in Mann's Heat these 2 totally opposite guys interact and talk and get to know each other. In Heat the cop and robber sit down and talk over a cup of coffee. Here the nice taxi driver and ruthless killer talk in-between hits.
B0002BO0US|4.0|First, off, let me say that I couldn't be a bigger fan of \\"Odessey and Oracle.\\"  I have the '98 30th Anniversary edition, and I love it to death.  If this remaster is your best shot at getting the album, buy it, by all means.  It's a very nearly perfect record, easily one of the best of the sixties. <br /> <br />Having said that, the clips that I've listened to of the bonus tracks sound completely out of character with the album at hand.  Most of them sound much more like a group trying to ape the Rolling Stones' sound circa \\"Flowers\\" or \\"Between the Buttons,\\" and while that's not a bad thing, necessarily, I simply don't think that they achieve anything near the craft or individuality of the album itself.  For that reason, I doubt I'd even listen to them much. <br /> <br />Moreover, the previous issue included, as part of the stereo version of the original album, the stereo take of \\"This Will Be Our Year,\\" certainly one of the highlights of an album full of them.  Personally, I greatly prefer that version, which, for technical reasons, does not include the horn charts of the finished version.  In my opinion, the horns do nothing for the song, and in some parts, they are downright obtrusive.  If the new master included, even as a bonus cut, the \\"sans horns\\" version of that tune, I might consider it.  As is, no thanks. <br /> <br />And, again, I just don't think that these bonus tracks, which were recorded apparently somewhat piece-meal for a follow-up album that was never released, really add to the value of the album. <br /> <br />Okay, that's it.  Like I said, if this is the version that you can find, don't hesitate to get this amazing album in any form that you can.  Me, I'm sticking with my tried and true Big Beat version.  Like the Beach Boys \\"Pet Sounds,\\" to which this record is often compared, bonus cuts are relatively beside the point.  This record is a perfect, unique entity, and recordings made by the band shortly thereafter are simply superfluous.
B00024I31C|5.0|After many years J.J.cale is back with a studio album. What a great feeling, and supersongs like \\" fancy dancer\\", laidback - no question - to tulsa and back is one of his best albums. First class and good to hear it after a stormy day! J.J. - you are the guitargroovemaster!!
B00003CXS4|5.0|This is my all time favorite movie so go buy it. I'm not going to bother typing a huge review but Brad Pitt and Jason Statham make stellar performances and so does the rest of the cast.
0515125024|4.0|We were hardly the first to become enamored with Lee Child's new thriller hero Jack Reacher, an ex-military police investigator extraordinaire who beat all odds in his debut in \\"Killing Floor\\".  He's back in his sophomore outing, and every bit as tough, smart, and determined to save the day as before.  This time he's just being a Good Samaritan to an injured woman struggling with her dry cleaning when the two of them are captured by what turns out to be one of those fanatical Montana freedom-or-die militia outfits.  The woman, Holly Johnson, a sophisticated FBI agent specializing in white collar crime soon turns out to be almost as gritty as Jack as they are forced to ride for days in a dark panel truck to some unknown destination, held captive each night.  That Holly is the daughter of the Joint Chief of Staff seems to be the hostage taker's motive, and before it's over, the FBI, the Marines, and Jack's good ol' ex-boss General Garber are all in on the militia attack.  Who will have the final say in life or death is never much in doubt, but there were several times where our leading characters could have been offed, contributing to the non-stop suspense we already expect of Child.  We'll also forgive some romantic hijinks 'tween Jack and Holly, although even that development matured to a surprising outcome<br /><br />With rapidly turning pages and a complicated plot til nearly the last page, we were thoroughly entertained and engaged.  Our only quibble might be that Reacher might be like a cat and get \\"9 lives\\", but it seems he used every one of them in this tale.  We can't wait to dig into the rest of the Child/Reacher series!
B000006NPY|5.0|Adore is a beautifully romantic and emotional album.  My personal favorite from the pumpkins collection(besides the airplane flies high).  Overall this album is much darker than any of their previous works and it takes the biggest leap forward as far as pushing and re-defining the boundries of rock music.  This album is a true sign of the pumpkins maturity as a band and billy as a singer/song writer.  The most significant difference between this album and their previous albums, aside from it being a bit more mellow, is that this album uses billy's vocals as the main driving point of the songs and album(as opposed to heavy guitars).  Although the guitars and other intruments are still critical contributions to the album (in a more atmospheric sense) it is the overall use of billy's singing and vocal tracks that really push the album forward and give it depth.  Not only does billy possibly provide his best singing on this album, but the vocal tracks are masterfully created with multiple tracks of overlapping vocals that seem to breathe life into the brilliantly poetic lyrics(listen on headphones).  Many have made the statement that this is more of an electronic album, but it really isn't.  Although there are hints of electronica in some songs (Apples+Oranges, Ava Adore, Pug) it is mostly an instrumental album.  If there is any weak point on the album it would be the percusion, but that would be expected with the loss of their very talented drummer jimmy chamberlin. however on the other hand, adore being the delicate album that it is, more elaborate drum work could have interfered with the overall mood and flow of the album. In any event, the pumpkins do a good job of making due with what they have by mixing in some electronic drum beats with real drums and the using effects on some of the drum tracks.  The only other minor issue with the album is that I don't think that the second track (Ava Adore) belongs on the album as it slightly interferes with the flow of the album.  All things considered, this is truly on of the pumpkins best and as always an inspiring and valid effort in a bland and commercial music industry. Anyone who is a fan of brilliantly written and put together music will appreciate this album.
0920668372|3.0|The first time I read this book I was balling by the end.  However, the first time my husband read it, he was appalled.  Once he shared his 'dark' view of the odd relationship being portrayed, I can't help but think of it upon repeat readings.  However, if he had never shared his view, I would think of this as very poignant reading portraying a very positive mother/son relationship.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|Well, it's time for you to get \\"familiarized\\" with New York's Finest! Since the debut of \\"Songs in A Minor,\\" I have been completely antsy in anticipation of my girl's next CD. And when I saw the video for \\"You Don't Know My Name,\\" I nearly fell off of the couch because the song was SO SWEET!! I was like, \\"Mannnnn, I have GOT to GET THAT cd when it drops!\\" So, for my birthday present, my brother bought me \\"The Diary of Alicia Keys\\". I am indebted to him for life, because he also bought me \\"Songs in A Minor\\". Anyhoo, I just had a feeling that this cd would be nothing short of amazing, and it truly was! From Track 1 to the last song, I feel as if I am in the studio with her. Alicia's voice is just that clear and sultry, that she transports the listener from the physical & actual listening, to an emotional participation.  <br /> <br />Since her first album dropped, I have totally dug her. She loves the music that she sings, plays and writes about. It's truly evident in her aura, because she emits that joy all the time. It's as though she lives to play music, lives to inspire people, but more importantly, lives to inspire herself. <br /> <br />I am really feeling her 2nd album: The Diary of Alicia Keys! It's more than just a melody; it's genius at its best! Her lyrics are well thought out, profoundly written and wonderfully expressed. She doesn't just overcome \\"sophomoric slump,\\" she entirely captures it, conquers it, defeats it. Her music is undeniably addictive, to say the least. My favorites, undoubtedly, are: Karma, Heartburn, You Don't Know My Name, If I Was Your Woman, Dragon Days & So Simple. <br />Her tracks are laced with fervent, thriving passion, accompanied by her catty, husky voice. A compelling victory sits embedded in this gem of a cd. <br /> <br />The DVD segment is an incredible journey through the cities that she has visited, and it also highlights her becoming intimate with the fans. Intimate in terms of sharing what she felt while writing and singingthe songs, how she has grown and progressed as an artist, but even more so, how she has matured as a woman. This CD & DVD are a wonderful combination of a thrill ride that you probably won't find in another \\"pretty packaged\\" artist. Don't let the amazing beauty and looks of Alicia fool you. She's hardcore and delicate, sweet & sassy, unpredicatble yet constant, and she so firmly & obviously believes in what she belts out.
0553382179|5.0|I cannot say enough good about Marla Cilley, aka \\"FlyLady\\".  Her methods have completely transformed my home, and I'm still just baby-stepping along.  But the transformation that has occurred in my home (and the lives of my family) because of Marla's very simple routines around the house (and her \\"coaching) are nothing short of a miracle.  The first 19 years of my marriage were spent wondering why I simply couldn't keep a \\"perfect\\" home like my mother did, my sister did, my aunt did, my grandma did -- it just seemed to be second-nature to them to keep an orderly home..... I felt like something was wrong with ME because my house seemed to always be a mess. <br /> <br />FlyLady, first of all, wants us to lose those goals of perfectionism and unrealistic expectations we place upon ourselves.  I love one of her mottos, \\"housework done imperfectly still blesses our family\\".  The fact is, many of us grew up in homes where \\"imperfect\\" cleaning wasn't allowed.  My mom demanded that I clean HER way, and redo it until it was done to HER satisfaction.  FlyLady's gentle encouragement and reminders that \\"we're not behind... just jump in where ever we are\\" are much more effective than the beating up I used to do to myself.   <br /> <br />What's remarkable is that in the nearly 2 years that I've been following FlyLady's methods, I clean WAY less than I did when my house was messy, cluttered, and rarely \\"company ready\\" without much preparation. Yet, due to her simple methods of creating quick and simple routines (i.e. I can now daily wipe the bathrooms down in 2 minutes or less which amazingly enough keeps them clean enough so that I NEVER have to spend the 1 hour that my mom insisted was required...), my house almost always looks \\"company ready\\".  No more late-night crisis cleaning for visitors or hiding behind the front door pretending to not be home so that I didn't have to let my house be seen...  The clutter is gone, routines are in place, and suddenly I have guilt-free TIME to do other things that I enjoy.   <br /> <br />The book is a great way to get started on the FlyLady methods and to get an overall picture.  But, I would recommend using the book in conjunction with her FREE website:  [...]    While the book is a great starting point, the website is a constant motivator with reminders, testimonials from others who struggle with these same issues.  Not all of us are \\"born organized\\".  Some of us need a mentor or a \\"coach\\" to \\"teach\\" us, and keep reminding us -- not \\"how\\" to clean -- but how to create basic routines in our lives for keeping a clean home,  menu planning, removing the clutter from our homes, financial matters, exercise, etc. that we so often neglect.   <br /> <br />The book isn't for those who are just looking for tips on getting organized, methods of \\"how to\\" clean -- there are plenty other books out there for that kind of stuff.
B0002IU988|2.0|Other than \\"Open Your Eyes\\" and some decent guitar solos by Tremonti, this album blows!  Myles Kennedy sounds like a hybrid of Shania Twain and Bobcat Goldthwait on the majority of the songs.  The lyrics are uninspiring.  In fact, one could probably take the lyrics from one song, put them in another song on the album, and it would sound about the same. <br /> <br />I had high hopes for the guys from Alter Bridge, but this album is not good.  It is boring.  Wasn't it Jimmy Page who once said that in order for a song to be a hit, people needed to be able to hum it?  There are no songs on this album that people will be able to hum!  The only thing that saves this album from a one-star review is some of the guitar work, otherwise this album is DOA.  Buy at your own risk and beware the Alter Bridge Groupie Brigade recommending the thing with five stars!
B0001EKZOQ|5.0|This album combining two maestros from completely different disciplines is a confluence of genius and a love letter to all the composers whose songs are included. After hearing the first verse of the first track my Mother(who has sung many latin love songs in Spanish in her singing career) remarked, \\"This is tasty!\\"  That summed it up perfectly.  Lagrimas Negras will surprise you, seduce you, entrance you, and ultimately force you to throw away your musical preconceptions.  Perhaps this is why The New York Times named it their Critics Choice Album of the Year for 2003 - perhaps it could be the album of the year for 2004 also?

B00005JMUA|4.0|Thursday, August 12, 2004 / 4 of 5 / Almost languid ending.<br /><br />Compared to the frenetic carnage of the first installation, the second has an almost languid ending to the chop-socky revenge saga.  Uma returns as the bride and continues her quest to wreak revenge on those who apparently killed her and her unborn child.  As the scenes shift between southwest spaghetti western locales and her training in the east; I was reminded that I actually preferred the first installment's Tokyo rumble and the treatment.  Granted, a second dose of the same killing would be tough to handle, it was just ... different.  More introspective and dare I say it, calm in its damage.  Uma is more precise here and not as whirlwind, tearing through 88 gangsters.  Taken together, it's an impressive homage piece and artistic statement.

0920668372|5.0|I give this book to all new parents. They usually don't \\"get it\\" during the first few months of parenthood. But once they bond with their kids, the underlying message of unconditional, enduring love suddenly hits home. Whenever I read this book, I cry. My teenagers tease me about it, but they also still read it. Reviewers who say it's creepy or incestuous don't understand the meaning or have a different view of parenting. Over the years, a least a dozen people have thanked me for the book and said how much they treasure it.
B00004RF9I|4.0|<br />Network is phenomenal. First of all, the acting is tight, and the dialogue is well written. I fell in love with the characters instantly.  In addition, the plot blew me away. The story begins with a depressed news anchor who announces that he will kill himself on air, and the story gets much more interesting from that point on. <br /> <br />Most importantly, this film was extremely prescient in its depiction of television news in an era of large coporate ownership.  Watching this piece of fiction brings to mind real-life current documentaries like \\"Outfoxed\\" and \\"The Merchants of Cool.\\" For those of us who are \\"mad as hell\\" about the role of mass media in today's society, this film is for you! <br /> <br />And, for a film that's fairly old, the ending was surprising and memorable. I wasn't ready! This is one of the better films that I've seen in the past year. Try it for yourself.
0385495323|5.0|This is the second book by Simon Singh, and he readily admits that he was surprised by the success of the first; `Fermat's Last Theorem'. If you enjoyed that, then this will delight and entertain you, as well as lead you forward in an easy manner. There are some very complex ideas and processes encountered, yet each is tackled not as a whole, but as a series of small steps, explained in simple terms. It seems that the author subscribes to the notion that there is no such thing as a hard subject - the only hard part is the number of simple steps that are used, and the order they are combined, in order to reach the complex picture.  <br /> <br />Singh states from the beginning that the book has two aims; to chart the evolution of codes, and to show that the study of codes and cryptology is as relevant for today as ever. Information always has had a high value, and there have been divers means employed throughout history to keep matters private where appropriate. The reasons for this secrecy are not always the same, but whether it is political, military, security or commercial, organisations and governments want to know that their information is safe, and at the same time strive to read similar matter from opponents. The history of codes and code breaking has been a struggle between the code makers, and the code breakers, with sometimes one and sometimes the other having the ascendancy. Sometimes intrigue and espionage have enabled a foothold to be gained to enable code breaking to continue. <br /> <br />The early use of codes and ciphers are explained well, and the author uses imaginative illustrations to convey his ideas. The chapters on modern developments, with private and public keys, for example, are brought to life with the example of mixing the colours of private paint stores. A mental picture is much better than mere words to describe the one-way functions that are used in encrypting and deciphering messages using public and private keys. It is also necessaryto understand some of the early developments in code making and code breaking to grasp what happened at Bletchley Park, in the breaking of the Enigma codes during World War II. Singh admits to simplifying the Enigma story, but this does not detract from a particularly absorbing part of the book. There is also good list of books and web sites, for those wishing to gain more information. This applies to many of the code stories, whether this is from archaeology (the Rosetta Stone, or Linear B), or the actual use of encryption (the Zimmermann telegram, Pretty Good Privacy).   <br /> <br />`The Code Book' was published prior to the events of September 11th 2001, but asks some pertinent questions on the nature of security. Just as code breaking and code making have been battling for many years, now that there are `unbreakable codes' available, the debate has moved on to the need for security or the protection of individual freedoms. It is believed that the Data Encryption Standard (DES) was weakened to enable this to be broken by US government agencies. This book is not just a popular and populist history; it also raises questions that are relevant to us all. That is why the second of Singh's aims has been met. The first is achieved in a hugely entertaining read. <br /> <br />Incidentally, the cipher challenge is still an integral part of the book, although the prize is no longer available. It took 1 year and 1 month for the challenge to be successfully claimed, a tribute to the difficulty of the ten parts. If you have read the book, and have a few idle moments, perhaps you would like to try to crack the Beale ciphers and claim the huge cache of gold and silver that the documents describe. Oh, and when you have finished that, there is always the breakthrough that is waited for Linear A. <br /> <br />Peter Morgan, morganp@supanet.com
B00008EY65|4.0|I am a huge comic book fan, but I've got limited experience with Hellboy, a character from an independent label.  So I bought the DVD, and watched with an open mind.<br /><br />First the bad news.  The makeup/costume work on Hellboy himself is not as good as it could have been. For example the makeup for Nightcrawler in X2 (though inaccurate) is more believeable.  Also, some of the acting was a little flat, and I actually would have liked a little more development of the minor characters.<br /><br />Now the good news--these minor drawbacks weren't enough to take me below 4 stars. Why? First, the main storyline is STRONG. The basic conflict reminds me a bit of \\"Spawn\\", in the sense that the story highlights the idea that good and evil aren't always inherent but involve choice.  The special effects were dazzling, and the sets were dark, moody, and believeable.<br /><br />I almost wish that this was a high-budget TV series instead of a movie. You can tell that there are layers of complexity in the relationships that Hellboy has with his colleagues, and we only get a glimpse of that in the film. Still, the balance between dialogue and action is excellent, and I was more than satisfied with the overall pacing.<br /><br />Finally, for you fans of Russian history, one of the key bad guys is none other than...Rasputin! Nope, he didn't die after all!<br /><br />I won't spoil the experience by giving away specific plot elements, but I'd rank Hellboy up there with Blade, X2, and SpiderMan (but behind Spidey 2) for comic book flicks.  If you like a hero with some internal conflict and some flavor, you'll definitely appreciate Hellboy. This movie mixes magic with traditional comic book action, and sprinkles in just enough history to capture your imagination.
B00005JMX6|4.0|There is a point in \\"The Girl Next Door - Unrated Edition' (which I received and promptly devoured, extra's and all, in one sitting) where the movie is in danger of changing in tone and focus from American Pie to Showgirls,  but luckily for the movie - and viewers - it recovers itself and ends in a definite teen comedy spirit.<br /><br />I never saw this movie in the theater so I cannot comment on what has been added to this \\"unrated edition\\" but there is certainly quite a lot of nudity, but nothing involving the main actors. There are some graphic scenes at a strip club (including lap dancing) and we get shots of one of the main actors watching a porn video at home.  There are some nude scenes from behind of both principal actors Emile Hirsch and Elisha Cuthbert, but as Hirsch points out on Side B of the disc (where most of the extras are located) the movie used a stand-in for those shots.<br /><br />I have a word of caution regarding the list of extra's on the Amazon page. One is titled a scene specific commentary by Hirsch and Cuthbert. What we have here though is not a commentary for the whole movie from the two stars, but rather several scenes on the flip side of the disc in which the two actors both give separate commentary.<br /><br />Largely (and unjustly) ignored at the box office this teen comedy starts of really well and within the first few moments had me rolling with laughter. The movie starts with a montage of sorts, we see the jocks, brains and cheerleader-types all stating, for their entry in the yearbook, what they \\"will always remember.\\"<br /><br />Then there is Matt (played by Hirsch) who is pondering this question. Sure, he has had a successful academic career - as illustrated by his acceptance to Georgetown - but he really hasn't done anything memorable in his senior year of high school.<br /><br />That's about to change for Matt though with the arrival next door of Danielle (played by Cuthbert), who plays a breathtaking beauty house-sitting for his neighbors.<br /><br />Entranced by her Matt is unable to stop himself from watching Danielle undress in the window opposite his bedroom - but he is spotted. From that moment he is on a rollercoaster ride. Danielle, amused and evidently attracted to Matt, shows him the excitement of living on the edge, from running naked through the streets to moonlight skinny dipping in his school principal's pool.<br /><br />Just as everything seems to be going so well between Matt and Danielle, Matt is shocked when one of his best friends Eli (who is a connoisseur of porn movies and full of in-experienced sex advice) shows one of his porn movies - in which Danielle is the main star.<br /><br />Foolishly following some of his friends advice, the two part company and moments later the movie changes tack and takes on a decidedly darker and more serious tone as Matt becomes sucked into the shadowy world of the pornographic movie industry.<br /><br />What follows is both inventive and highly amusing. How will Matt afford to get into Georgetown? What will become of Danielle? These are just some of the questions in this entertaining movie that borrows heavily and liberally from a number of the John Hughes movies of the 1980s and the AMERICAN PIE movies of more recent years. The movie ends on a high note in a conclusion that is both satisfying and enjoyable.<br /><br />Now onto the part that most readers of this review are more interested in - the extra's. On Side A of the disc we have an OK director's commentary from director Luke Greenfield and an at times amusing and at other times fascinating trivia track.<br /><br />Then on Side B of the disc we have the aforementioned seven to eight scene specific commentaries from Hirsch and Cuthbert (Hirsch curiously has one more) and deleted and extended scenes with optional directors commentary. None of these scenes are of any particular value to anyone but completists or fans of the movie. They add nothing to the feature, but do have a curiosity factor to them. They also chose the better of the two endings also.<br /><br />Of more interest is an amusing featurette in which actor Chris Marquette (who plays Eli in the movie) poses as a porn producer and lures in all too interested men (there'e a cute blonde on the bed afterall) who get decidedly less interested (for the most part) when the girl is replaced by a big burly guy.<br /><br />We are also offered a stills gallery and a VERY short gag reel as well as trailers for a couple of other like-minded movies in addition to one promotional trailer for several other Fox titles. There is also a trailer for THE GIRL NEXT DOOR with the subtitle `Dirrrty,' which in reality isn't really that much of a big deal.<br /><br />All in all, this is a good and entertaining movie, it seems to lose its footing half way through but successfully and engagingly returns to top form before the final credits roll.

If you're looking for Creed, these guys have come to make them history and start what a true rock band is supposed to be.
0393035158|5.0|Harris' book is an impressive read.  Even though I don't agree with everything he says, his book makes me question some of my beliefs.  If he says things that are difficult to hear (and he does), maybe that's exactly what we need in these dangerous times. Not only does it show tremendous scholarship, the book is far more compelling than the usual non fiction.  Highly recommend.
0316666343|3.0|I am an English teacher. Granted, I just finished reading \\"The Great Gatsby\\" for the umpteenth time, but I was disappointed by Sebold's book. I was looking for a lyrical read--full of unique, provocative turns of phrase that make a book experience into a vision--disappointed. I was looking for resolution at the end, but I feel the end of the book was weak. I found myself much more interested in the tidbits about the life of the criminal, but these were served up sparingly. The mother's reaction to events is also perplexing as presented by the author, not ambiguous in the positive, artistic sense but incomplete might be a better way of putting it, or inhabited by a psychology that doesn't make sense. It's not a great book, but an okay book. A quick read. Merely adequate with room for improvement. Probably will make a better film adaptation...reads a bit like a screenplay in prose.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Quentin Tarantino originally made the `Kill Bill' movie to be seen in a single showing. While one is not left with many dangling loose ends as you are when you walk out of the first `Lord of the Rings' chapter `The Fellowship of the Ring', you definitely feel an imbalance created by the intensity of some scenes unbalanced by a suitable resolution. Tarantino strikes me as one of those rare directors who will take risky scenes to their logical conclusion and make them work much better than if he had lost his nerve and abbreviated the action in the scene. This is similar to Stanley Kubrick who, in `2001' can draw an utterly banal scene out to great lengths to intensify the drama of the scene to follow. As with Kubrick, Tarantino can generally pull this off, but the technique betrays him a bit in this movie, due to the absence of the resolving scene, to be continued in `Kill Bill Volume 2'.<br /><br />By far the most famous scene in this movie is the combat scene between `The Bride' played by Uma Thurman and the Tokyo crime gang of the object of the Bride's first revenge target. Aside from missing the resolution of a proper denouement, the scene is pure comic book superhero implausible. I will even go so far as to say that it is not even the best choreographed battle scene I have ever scene on film with hand to hand weapons. That distinction goes to some of the battle scenes in the Brad Pitt vehicle, `Troy', which succeeds in saying new things about filming hand to hand combat with edged weapons. Tarantino relies on relatively standard albeit very competent `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' style choreography. Even if one buys into the absurd notion of 21st century combat with Samurai swords rather than Uzi's or Kalishnakovs, the notion of a warrior's beating 90 to 1 odds in an open field without even the advantage of a bottleneck like the famous battle of Thermopyle is less believable than an elf warrior bringing down an Oliphant crowned with 10 archers in the big battle scene of `Lord of the Rings'. After all, in `Rings', we have already bought into a fantasy world where swords and arrows are the only weapons available to the hero of inherently special abilities on the side of truth and justice, not just out for revenge.<br /><br />Aside from this imbalance created by the `big fight scene' without a resolution, the movie is clearly first rate, in many ways the equal to `Volume 2' in the quality of the direction and story line. Tarantino's famously asynchronous scene placements are masterfully done to achieve a positive effect on the impact of the storytelling. Tarantino's technique was a bit unsure in `Reservoir Dogs' but it was used to very good effect in `Pulp Fiction'. Quentin has clearly mastered the potentially disconcerting effect in these movies, using it to compensate to some degree for the incomplete story in this movie. There are other scenes where one wants to not even believe what they are seeing, as he shows scenes similar to the great James Cameron directed scene in `Aliens' where the little girl is threatened from behind by the queen alien, and it is by no means certain that hero Ripley will arrive in time for the rescue.<br /><br />The role and performance of Uma Thurman dominate this movie. A sign of this fact is in the credit crawl, where I spotted at least six (6) credits dedicated to the care and grooming of Ms. Thurman. Watching her in this movie gives ample justification to the opinion that when she appeared in a supporting role to Ben Affleck in `Paycheck', her talents were being wasted. Thurman and Tarantino seem to have sharpened her performance to as fine an edge as there is on the samurai swords so prominently featured in the fight scenes. Thurman's whole body plays an important part, even down to the anticipation one feels while we wait to see if she can move her paralyzed great toe and thereafter the rest of her atrophied legs. She looks every inch the part of the samurai warrior, trumping performances of Tomb Raiders, Charlies' Angels, and other female martial artists. Lucy Liu, Vivica Fox, and Daryl Hannah also give strong performances, although Hannah' `big scene' comes in `Volume 2'.<br /><br />Bill never actually appears on the screen in `Volume 1', and this is OK, as it holds something in reserve for `Volume 2'. Michael Madsen's character appears only briefly, to reappear and be dealt with in `Volume 2'. Tarantino, like Kubrick and Woody Allen, has a real talent for using music from other sources to nuance his scenes, but somehow, this does not work as well in `Volume 1' as it does in `Volume 2' or in `Pulp Fiction'. It may just be me, in that the music simply did not touch associations I could make with these selections. I also found the very odd `Matrix' style red / green dominated coloring more annoying in `Volume 1' than I did in `Volume 2'.<br /><br />The use of Japanese cartoon art in one of the scenes may seem oddly out of place to some viewers, but I think it really works in the very least, to tell the story of the main Japanese character and to hark back to the source of the story `The Bride' in a Japanese anime picture novel.<br /><br />`Kill Bill Volume 2' is more balanced with fewer strains on your ability to believe the action than this `Volume 1', but `Volume 1' improves after being seen together with `Volume 2'. If possible, do yourself a favor and watch the two movies together.

055357342X|5.0|I have just finished reading the whole &#34;A Song of Ice and Fire&#34; saga cover to cover. It took me about 3-4 months and the stroy did not lose its grip at any point. I was compelled to keep going till I knew and understood more and more about the characters, and the narrative revealed itself during this process.  <br />What more is there to say? Just that it is a true literary achievement, by any standard. <br /> <br />I do have only one slight &#34;complaint&#34;. As you read the three books consecutively you notice that Martin does not change his writing technic regarding the timeline of the chapters themselves. Each one of them is opened in the wake of a recent activity which was implied to in a preceding chapter (of the same character). Then, after a page or two the narrator flashbacks and speaks of that recent activity. What we have in the end is an ever recurring cycle of:  <br />Present-&#62; Flashback (recent past)-&#62; develpoing present...  <br />I am positive that had Mr. Martin wanted to be more versatile regarding the structure of the narrative he would have added to the saga a new dimension, which would have kept the readers on their toes, a bit more. <br />

B000286S8S|5.0|First of all I think this is a great 2 cd collection.  Its a much better greatest hits album, than their Best Of: Vol 1.  Which was a lame attempt at a greatest hits album. There new song It's About Time, I actually like. At least I can hear a guitar solo.  In fact it should the theme song for a Chrono Trigger movie.  The other two are so-so, and nothing special.  they probably could have been axed for a song like Humans Being and/or This Dream is Over.   Humans Being and Doing Time/Baluchiterium really should have been added to the cd. The Hagar-Roth leap frog effect on the cd kinda bothers me, would have preferred having all Roth-era songs on the 1st cd and Hagar-era songs on the 2nd cd.  In reality my only gripe with the cd is the Roth-Hagar leap frog effect, the couple of tracks that were left off and the 2 sub par new recordings.  But over all if you are a VH fan I really do recommend it.  A definate improvment over there last greatest hits album and really does have there best songs over the years.
0345409671|1.0|At first the book is interesting. It gives a different view on creation and the battle against good and evil. Yet when Lestat goes into hell Anne Rice gets too carried away with trying to describe people in it and what's going on. I started to think I was in hell just trying to finish the book or at least get to the point of his journey. I thought the best part of the book would be how it ends, yet I was wrong. Horrible ending (more like disapointing). The story should have finished half ways, the rest is just a waiste of time.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Fahrenheit 9/11 is an important and powerful film.  It indicts the media almost as much as it does President Bush.  Its facts are very well backed-up -- see the free web-based encyclopedia for an excellent and thorough review.  [...] <br /> <br />The movie is important because it shows the footage and quotes that we should have seen elsewhere.  Colin Powell saying that Iraq was not a threat was footage that we should have seen before the war.  For those with any ability to show skepticism, we saw that the threat from Iraq was being exaggerated. <br /> <br />The film also gives a peek behind the curtain of national politics in the United States.  You start to realize how much the presidency (this administration and earlier ones) are so much about acting and show business. <br /> <br />Reviewers talk about the air space being open on Sept. 14, 2001, but it was still very difficult for the average members of the public to get air tickets.  (I have a friend who was trying to get out of New York City at the time.)  And hundreds of people were being detained for weeks on relatively flimsy connections whereas whole plane-loads of Saudis and bin Ladens were allowed to leave with very brief interviews almost certainly because of their connection to Bush. <br /> <br />One other important message from the movie is that war is horror.  It should always be a last resort.  Invading Afghanistan was necessary; invading Iraq was not.  It is morally wrong to use war as just another tool of foreign policy.  If you think that war is no big deal or that it is exciting or fun to bomb and shoot people, please see this movie. <br /> <br />I give the movie 5 stars for powerful content, excellent editing, important facts, and moving music.  This is not your typical summertime film.  Bring some kleenex.  And vote. <br />
B000244EMO|3.0|The Good: <br />First things first: Everything that pertains to 'the Predator' the creature, is FIVE star stuff. The look, the concept, the sounds, the... everything. One of the most believeable 'Aliens' created, trust me, being a Trekker, I've seen it all. While of course I love the Vulcans, the Romulans, etc., they all speak English and seem generally 'man made'. Even Star Wars can't hold a candle to this realism, most of those races just seem arbitrary and made up, some even comical. But the Predator is truly a frightening beast that has a lean towards fair play at the same time. It looks horrifically terrific and is a true menace. <br /> <br />The Bad: <br />Most everything else. The acting is stiff. The casting is 'eh'. The bulk of the story is long winded and uninteresting. The chemistry is lacking. The last 30 minutes of this movie are quite good, but in true action form even here everything needs to be 'explained' to the viewer.   <br /> <br />Wrap-up: <br />There is such a delicious race beating underneath the armor-faced Predator mask, it's just a shame to see it wasted on a movie not worthy of it.
B000059XUO|5.0|I remember seeing the original in the theater and it was spectacular. Brandon Lee did one of the best acting ever. The action was awesome, if that can do justice. He is the one and only \\"Crow\\". It still is my all time favorite movie and am glad that it is on dvd. It is ashame that so much trauma had to suround this movie at the time. He had a tragic life with his father and all. This movie at the time would of been his big break. Anyway this movie is a 10 on a scale of 1-5. That is how great it is. You have to be into future flicks though. But I still think the average joe will love it too.
B0000024V2|3.0|I really dig Johnny's guitar playing. There is no doubt he is a Great. However, I find this release a little lacking in the song department. Most of these tunes are pretty weak, and I don't think too much of the production quality, either. But this is a hard-rocking album, and Winter does play some blistering guitar throughout. I think if you look at this as a \\"record\\" of Johnny's style and are the type who can enjoy focusing on a guitar player and his passions, then this might be an cd you want to pick up. I will recommend Johnny's \\"Still Alive & Well\\" over this release. I have to mention that when I dramatically thinned out my cd collection years ago, \\"Second Winter\\" was a disk I held onto, and I guess that speaks something for it.
B00006690F|5.0|Some of the reviews of this album are pathetic. It is a great solid album with chart toping songs and it gives you an in depth view in the life of Marshal Mathers. But it bothers me when a person who obviously knows nothing of music, writes a bogus review. I realy found it intresting where one review says, \\" songs like soldier, and the kiss have nothing to do with eminem.\\" If maybe the reviewer knew anything about the artist before even writting the review, he would have known that eminem's X-Wife Kim cheated on him witch obviously relates to the song. And the song soldier was a way for him to spill out his frustration on lawyers, judges, and IGNORANT PEOPLE.  <br />Overall the album was solid, though it seemed to be to comercail for eminem. The Marshal Mathers LP was a higher time for eminem with more feeling and thought was put into the album.The Eminem show is a great album to own.
B00005JMAH|4.0|The operative word here is \\"movies.\\" Folks, books are books. Movies are movies. Movies that try to be books are not good movies. You may enjoy seeing every detail from the books in the movies, but an eight-hour movie is not a good movie by any stretch. This has good pacing, good staging, great acting and a wonderful mix of adolescent disaffection and magical whimsy. Get over yourselves, disgruntled fans. The world already has too many Star Trek and Star Wars nerds. It doesn't need Potter nerds.
B00005JMAH|5.0|For the people who are bitc*ing about one camera shot or a part thats left out of the book, Id'e like to see them direct it. <br /> <br />It is impossible to include everything from the books so get over it!!!  <br /> <br />Every camera shot is beautiful. THIS is a director with a vison. Chris Columbus was ok, but every camrea shot looked the same. The same old straight ahead camrea shot. But in POA, the camrea moves, the shots are visually complex and stunning and *different* than what your used too.  <br /> <br />The teenagers are actually wearing clothes! They have a good wardrobe this time around. It makes them seem more like teenagers now that they're not in the cloaks all the time. <br /> <br />The movie is (for the millionth time) darker. The look of the film reflects this new mood. And I'm glad the director chose to go this route and actually deal with the meat of the story because HELLO! They are 14 in the movie not 5 or 6!!! So please adults stop bringing your damn toddlers to the movie because it's for teenagers not 7 or 8 year olds who never touched the books. <br /> <br />The movie was genuinly funny instead of going for cliche lines (that werent in the books)like Columbus. I suppose I'm being hard on him but Prisoner of Azkaban is just so much better. But don't take it from me. Listen to J.K Rowling who wrote em' who was quoted as saying she \\"absolutley loved\\" the film. So I guess that means she doesn't care if a few things are swithced or left out. So why should you then?
0425152251|4.0|Having read Maya (another book by the same author) before this book, the plot is delightfully familiar. <br />The author brilliantly use time and characters' perspectives to weave together a recursive plot that kept going on and on in the mind. The reader's world seems to merged into the story. <br /> <br />Sophie's philosophy course was written by Alberto Knox which in turns was a world created by Albert Knag to teach his daughter Hilde philosophy.  <br />Their universe was in turn conjured by Jostein Gaarder to introduce philosophy to the readers.  <br />But that's not the end of course. The lingering question is still, are we also living in a world, conceived by a writer, far beyond the capacity that we can comprehend philosophically?
1400032717|5.0|<br />This is an excellent read, a bit of a difference in the mystery that is captured within the book. A captivating read, with an autistic child as the center character of the book. Excellent syle and difficult to put down. I highly recommend this book. <br /> <br />Also recommending: Nightmares Echo,She's Come Undone,Atonement, In the Heart of the Sea
B00008DDJT|2.0|This is so typical of misleading hype and false advertising. Awesome posters of dragons burning up London, as Apache Copters engage in intense battle with them. Sounds really great, doesn't it?  Well, SURPRISE!  None of this is to be found in this dreary disappointer.We begin with a suspenseful, promising opening scene where a dragon is accidentally unearthed in a London excavation site, and escapes. So far, so good.  Now for the bad news:  The director (for whatever moronic reasons) then cuts to '20 Years Later' - after everything that is worth seeing has already happened.  WTF??!!Imagine if something like WAR OF THE WORLDS began with the Martians' arrival, then immediately jumps ahead a few years after all the action and suspense has occured. Bet you'd really love that. I can envision furious audiences storming the box office, demanding their money back - and rightfully so. You just don't pull something as deceptively cheesy as that, and expect any loyalty from your disgruntled audience and ex-fans.  RoF skips right past the real story of the dragons' assault on the modern world, and their eventual destruction of civilization. Wouldn't that have made a far greater movie than this tepid dreck, which only has fleeting moments of any real action?  Imagine spectacular scenes of cities being devastated by armies of dragons, with modern technologies' desperate fight to try to stop them. And when the scientists learn that they caused the dinosaurs' extinction - and a flashback that SHOWS this.With a decent script and right director, a prequel could really deliver. Just keep Roland Emmerich and all his idiocy far away from it.Otherwise, another vapid wasted opportunity that could have really delivered - if anyone had bothered to care.And the budget was $95,000,000. So don't give me that 'not enough money' cop-out. How about a serious prequel?  Or am I 'asking too much' from most of the bozos involved in 'film making' today?
B000002LIX|4.0|Bottom line, I feel that Been Caught Stealing is one of the worst songs ever written by Jane's.  Only song that comes close is Pets from Porno for Pyro's.  I am sure that the excessive radio play has had something to do with it, but they are mindless drivel of blech.  Stop is an epic song.  Easiliy one of my all time fav's from any genre or band.  No One's Leaving is great too.  The rest of the album is ehhh, but the strength of the 1st two songs carries this album to 4 stars in my opinion. <br /> <br />If you are just getting into Jane's, Nothing's Shocking is still the best of course. <br /> <br />I will say one thing, if you are able to see Jane's live, they make even the ehhh songs on this album great.  Maybe they were never meant to be good in studio.
B0002858YS|4.0|Interesting album, reminds me of the peak of the 80's New Wave Scene. Danceable pop that rocks. Interesting songs. Sure \\"Somebody Told Me\\" is over played, but the CD will give you a chance to explore other fine tracks that \\"Radio\\" does not play. Tracks like \\"Jenny was a Friend of Mine\\", \\"Smile Like You Mean It\\" and \\"Midnight Show\\" make for a well-rounded disc loaded with great tunes.  It will be interesting to see if this band can survive the 2 hit wonder status (Mr. Brightside being the second song released), or will my kids be watching 2 hit wonders of 2004 on VH1 in 2024
B000274THQ|5.0|GOODBYE, LENIN! is a solid piece of filmmaking that incorporates the best of both storytelling and conscious raising. It is all the more amazing to watch as a piece of history: the action takes place from immediately before the fall of the Berlin Wall to its aftermath eight months later. The story is simple: an East German family has lost the head of the household for (apparently!) fleeing to West Germany for the love of another woman. The wife (Katrin Sass) is dumbstruck but survives and continues her activist activities as a Socialist/Communist, teaching children and workers the good points of being an East German Socialist. One evening her son Alex (Daniel Bruhl) takes part in a demonstration against the government's curfews and ends up being beaten by the police. The mother, seeing this happen, falls in the street having suffered a cardiac arrest. She is hospitalized, and is in a coma for eight months during which time her son Alex sits by her bedside, hopeful she will recover. During the coma, of course, the Berlin Wall falls, Germany is united, and socialism of the Cold War is over. When the mother awakens, Alex is told that her condition is delicate and she must be spared any shocks. To this end, Alex and his sister and friends the mother home, change the house to resemble the pre-Berlin Wall fall, effect bogus broadcasts to make the mother feel that the East German philosophy has triumphed and the West Germans are moving into the better socialistic climes of East Germany! How this charade plays out with all of the consequences of the good intentions of Alex ties the movie together. Far from being a preachy political satire or documentary, this tender movie is more about family bonds than anything else. The direction by Wolfgang Becker is superb, as is the acting by all involved. Watching this film will entertain you, inform you of critical historical events, and leave you with a lovely afterglow. Recommended!
B00005JMUA|5.0|The two films cut together would have been the way to go in my opinion. Heck as one 4 hour epic it may have been noticed by the Academy Awards just for being so incredibly unique. We all know the reason Miramax films released two movies instead of one. YOUR MONEY TIMES TWO! Since I respect Miramax due to hundreds of quaility films, I'll let them stiff me this once. Quentin Tarantino is an amazing filmmaker, I love all his films. The ones he wrote and directed anyway. Some of the screenplays he wrote in the past were directed by others than himself. Which they were mostly cool flicks, but they might have been better had he made them himself. The reason I say this film isn't for everyone is because I have a part time job in a video store and I hear some people say how they just don't get into it. They say they didn't like the first Kill Bill and they aren't interested in bothering with the 2nd. I did get a customer to get both films and have a double feature. He later said it was one of the best film experiences he'd ever had. At first he wasn't interested in the series. Truthfully these two films together are an amazing piece of work and it's ashame to over look them. I'm not saying get the kids rounded up and have family movie night with Kill Bill, that's obvious. I hope people know that this isn't for children. It is great entertainment for grown ups who like deep, dark and dramatic sword swinging action with plenty of Tarantio style humor. So, watch'em together or watch'em seperate.. just watch'em!! One last thing ..Uma Thurman is in a word.. Astonishing!!
B0001DI0FI|5.0|This is an excellent film very true to the books it was based on. Plus Peter Weir is one of the best directors of our time. Russell Crowe is perfectly cast as fictional British naval hero Capt. \\"Lucky\\" Jack Aubrey. You might be considering reading the books this movie was based on. An excellent decision. The Aubrey-Maturin series is one of the all-time classic collections of historical fiction and will be studied and enjoyed for many years to come. If you want to live, eat and breathe Napoleonic-era naval warfare this is your ticket to the high seas of the early 19th century. Start with Book 1 in the series as they follow in chronological order. These books have provided me with hours and hours of entertainment and enlightenment. Don't worry about whether to watch the movie or read the books first ... movie will whet your appetite for more!
B0002IU988|4.0|If you're looking for the next musical high point that challenges everything you know and tells you the meaning of your pitful life, skip this album.<br /><br />If you're looking for a good, solid, Rock N' Roll album with no-holds bared guitar solos and a singer with real range, don't miss this album.<br /><br />A lot of people will simply say this is Creed with a new singer and therefore isn't good. While that kind of statment is narrow minded, it's not completely untrue. This is Creed with a new singer. In fact, it's what Creed should have been all along. Powerful guitar and drum arrangements with a singer who's more concerned about hitting the note than putting on a Jesus Christ pose.<br /><br />It's obvious that these guys can't help but sound like Creed, since the three instrumentalists did form Creed 10 years ago. However, singer Myles Kennedy doesn't fit the Creed mold. The former Mayfield Four singer spends most of this album channeling Chris Cornell style vocals and the music follows suite. While songs like \\"Open Your Eyes,\\" \\"In Loving Memory\\" and \\"Down To My Last\\" sound like Creed left-overs, other songs like \\"Find The Real,\\" \\"One Day Remains\\" and \\"Metalingus\\" show that Alter Bridge does have a sound all its own some where in the mix. Not to mention the fact that the majority of the songs on this album feature one blistering guitar solo after another, thus proving that Mark Tremonti does know how to do more than play Drop-D power chords.<br /><br />The rest of the album is a throw back to early and mid-90's grunge. Fans of Soundgarden, Pearl Jam and early Silverchair will find this album highly engaging and entertaining.<br /><br />The book on Creed is closed and the 'bridge' is burned. Alter Bridge is here and now we'll see if it can surpass the success of the jugernaut that was Creed.
0316921173|1.0|Infinite Jest?  Interminable Jest, more like.  This annoying novel is grossly overwritten, 1079 pages of 8-point type, plus 98 pages of footnotes in 6-point type.  Large sections of it are superfluous logorrhea and should have been cut; the thing reads like the world's most awesome speed rant, though this may be deliberate.  The plot is rudimentary, all telegraphed in advance, and moves at a glacial pace.  When I finally finished the thing, I wanted my time back.    Hated one of the protagonists, Don Gately, for reasons requiring some self-examination to discover.  (1) He's the sort of large ugly ignorant self-satisfied anti-intellectual homophobic cretin I've always disliked in real life.  (2) His presentation is hypocritical, one of the most intellectual anti-intellectual statements I've ever read.  The more apparent it became Wallace intended to reward him, the more I hated him.    Other unlikable things:  (3) The polemical treatment of marijuana as virulently addictive, which most experienced people know to be nonsense; sure, some vanishingly microscopic percentage of users get into trouble with it, particularly since the introduction of the high-resin kind in response to pot's illegality (it being easier to transport and store in smaller quantities), but still a far smaller number than with booze, let alone cocaine, speed or narcotics.  (4) The smarmy closet god stuff.  (Sample paraphrase: \\"...the religion only morons believe in, but that works anyway.\\")  At least this cannot be said to pander to Jesus freaks.  No moron possibly could get through this book.    Probably the most annoying thing of all is that, after 1079 pages, it doesn't end!  The story is left hanging up in the air, as if there were another 50 or 60 pages yet to come (or, considering Wallace's prolixity, 200-300).  Evidently, Wallace simply got bored of writing it and decided we could make up the rest for ourselves, or maybe his editor finally put his/er foot down and said, \\"Enough.\\"    True, the very first chapter gives us a skeletal outline of the principal events to come.  This section reads as if it were written last, after the work had been abandoned, to prevent it from being a total cheat.  But far more is left unresolved.  Characters are abandoned in mid sub-plot.  Painstakingly built-up mysteries are shrugged off    In short, virtually the entire denouement is missing.  After 1079 pages, just as the excitement is finally building toward the events we've been promised, the thing ends.  It's the book's final jest, and it's on us.    At least the language is inventive and original, and a bit harder to pastiche than one might think, considering that its principal device is merely to string clauses together without limit or punctuation.  There are some truly comic bits too-conceptual comedy mostly, the kind you chuckle over only when you think back on them.  Only wish there'd been more of them.    Altogether, I believe I have now had a lifetime dose of David Foster Wallace.
B0000CDL93|4.0|\\"JFK\\" is a movie that combines drama with a documentary style, and it's a shocking experience for many reasons. The movie was made back on those days when Kevin Costner was a superstar in a hot streak, with movies like \\"Dances With Wolves\\" and \\"Bull Durham\\", and in this movie Costner gave one of his finest performances. He was the centerpiece of this daring and powerful movie. <br /> <br />But he was not alone, Oliver Stone surrounded him with an all-star cast, that includes big names like Sissy Spacek, Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci, Gary Oldman, Kevin Bacon, Jack Lemmon, John Candy, Donald Sutherland, Walter Matthau, Wayne Knight and Vincent D'Onofrio. <br /> <br />\\"JFK\\" is built with theories, some of them are obviously fiction or just a mere supposition, but a lot of them seem authentic and based in real evidence. Oliver Stone pointed the finger to almost everybody: the FBI, the CIA, Lyndon Johnson, J. Edgar Hoover, Clay Shaw and many others. But he seems to hit the center of the target when he practically says that Kennedy was murdered because he didn't wanted to take part in the HUGE industry that is the war, an industry that moves BILLIONS of dollars, and a big part of USA's economical power. <br /> <br />\\"JFK\\" presented an innovative narrative style, it combined real footage with acted scenes, but the acted parts were processed as historical footage, he also used a fast, dynamic editing to create interest in the audience, and of course \\"JFK\\" is interesting and provocative at all time. \\"JFK\\" has great acting (although John Candy was over the top, and some hair wigs are just hilarious), great direction, a solid script (yes, some theories are too forced, but there are solid theories as well), and the movie achieves its biggest goal: the movie gives something to think about to the viewer.
B00003CY0V|4.0|If nothing else, this movie blows you away (no pun intended) with three awesome set pieces:<br /><br />1.  The opening 360 degree angle on the exploding hostage is as disturbing as this kind of scene can get.<br /><br />2.  Travolta and Jackman's wild ride through the streets of LA has unusual twists and explosive action.<br /><br />3.  The flying bus at the climax is original and nervewracking, and the movie's set piece.<br /><br />Actually, even though John Travolta's turn as Gabriel Sear, is another scenery-chomping bit of excellence, the movie really belongs to Hugh Jackman.  Jackman, a Tony winner for the life of Peter Allen, proves his versatility in this heroic role.  Rumors of his being considered for the New James Bond should blossom, as I feel Jackman would make a great 007.<br /><br />Of all the movies I've seen the talented Halle Berry, this is one of her least effective performances.  Boobs aside, Berry doesn't really do anything but add sexual tension.  Considering her emotional speech when she won her Oscar about bringing non-Caucasian females their first best actress, you'd think she'd stop making movies like this and DIE ANOTHER DAY, where her physical attributes are more important than her acting ability.  CATWOMAN is another example of this.  Halle is a fine actress, but she needs to start acting again, instead of strutting her stuff.<br /><br />Overall, this is one of those adrenaline hormonal pictures but done with enough style and panache to be recommended.
B00004SAAX|5.0|This album is especially impressive because the organist is completely blind! Somehow he was able to memorize all the organ works with complete accuracy and play them brilliantly! More impressively is that he was even able to compose his own brilliant ending to Bach's last fugue of the Art of Fugue, Contrapunctus 14, which was to be the pentacle of all Bach's contrapuntal compositions, but was left unfinished shortly after introduction of the b-a-c-h fugal subject!
B00005JMUL|5.0|I have read the book to my kid and loved it.  When I saw the trailer for this movie I flipped.  The movie The Polar Express is about a kid that jumps on a midnight train in the middle of the night and is driven to the North Pole with a bunch of kids.  When he gets there, the North Pole is like a place that can't be like the north pole in the movie The Santa Clause with Tim Alan.  It has to be animated in order for the Director to expand on what he can make.  However, the animation looks real anyway so who cares.  Plus, we have got Tom Hanks, the king of voices, playing alot of the parts.  It will be a magical rollercoaster, especially when the boy gets picked by Santa Clause to receive the first gift of Christmas.  I suggest not only to see the movie but get the book.(It is a picture book for a kid but it is great!)
B0001FGBL6|4.0|I know it's redundant to call Epica epic, but I thought that I should point it out because they live up to their name. They are comparable to Nightwish, old Theatre of Tragedy, Tristania,Therion, and Rhapsody. Beautiful female vocals, classical orchestration, magnificent choral work, dark male grunts and screams, and complex heavy metal instrumentation make this an incredible album. Very much a worthy purchase.
B00020X88O|4.0|Do you think this movie is awful because that's what you have heard, or because that's what critics say? If so, jump off the bandwagon and see it again for yourself. <br /> <br />'Showgirls' is not a good movie, but it is a great movie. Much like 'Battlefield Earth', it's an enjoyable two hours that will definitely keep you entertained. The script is lowbrow and amateurish, the directing overly serious and self-important, and the performances totally over-the-top. But there are also good points to the movie. <br /> <br />The relationship between Nomi and Crystal is the film's high point. Do they love each other or hate each other? I still can't decide. There's a nuanced interchange between them, and Gina Gershon and Elizabeth Berkeley do a great job conveying their tumultous interactions. <br /> <br />Speaking of Berkeley, she in no way deserves to be pilloried for her acting in this movie. She takes the clumsy script (written by Joe Eszterhas for $2 million) and does the best she can with it. Is it Oscar-worthy? No way, but neither is it horrible. Is her character likeable? No, but no one in this film is likeable. That's part of the message that Paul Verhoeven (who is my favorite director) was trying to convey. Too bad he chose such a hamfisted, awkward way to convey it. <br /> <br />But that's all part of what makes this movie fun. The VIP edition contains posters, photo stills from the movie, drinking games, shot glasses, playing cards, and a great commentary track. <br /> <br />Love 'Showgirls' or hate 'Showgirls', you won't be bored watching this.

B00005JLT5|5.0|Wow, initially, a friend recommended me to watch this movie after he received it for christmas. I was almost laughing at him because of the commercials and I thought it was horrible at the time. After constant nagging by him, I decided to give it a try and I feel in love with it. This movie is incredible and almost, almost brought me to tears. If you know me, I'm one that you can't get to start crying.  <br /> <br />::HERE IS A SYNOPSIS THAT I WROTE:: <br /> <br />The true story of Wladyslaw Szpilman who, in the 1930s, was known as the most accomplished piano player in all of Poland, if not Europe. At the outbreak of the Second World War, however, Szpilman becomes subject to the anti-Jewish laws imposed by the conquering Germans. By the start of the 1940s, Szpilman has seen his world go from piano concert halls to the Jewish Ghetto of Warsaw and then must suffer the tragedy of his family deported to a death camp, while Szpilman is conscripted into a forced German Labor Compound. At last deciding to escape, Szpilman goes into hiding as a Jewish refugee where he is witness to the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and the Warsaw City Revolt in 1945. <br /> <br />I guarantee you will absolutely LOVE this movie. <br /> <br />Thank You and enjoy
0440236304|5.0|Just like the real thing, the author tells his story without fanfare.  No Hollywood special effects, music, embellishments, etc., this reads just like you're sitting with Burgett over a cup of coffee and a game of checkers as he recounts the horrors he and his \\"buddies\\" went through to rid the world of fascism.  I agree with the other positive things said about this book on his page, so let me let the author speak for himself in a few quick, unforgettable excerpts, as this book has many: <br /> <br />After breaking his leg on his first practice jump:  \\"The only way I could travel was to lie on my side, throw the chute forward, crawl to it, and repeat the procedure over and over again.  Finally another jeep came up and this time a sergeant leaned over the steering wheel and said, 'That's the spirit we like around here,' and then drove off.  I crawled for what seemed to be hours.\\" <br /> <br />On the early morning hours of June 6, 1944, having just dropped behind enemy lines:  \\"Another plane came in diagonally over the field....then I saw vague, shadowy figures of troopers plunging downward.  Their chutes were pulling out of the pack trays and just starting to unfurl when they hit the ground.  Seventeen men hit the ground before their chutes had time to open.  'That dirty SOB pilot,' I swore to myself, 'he's hedgehopping and killing a bunch of troopers just to save his own ass.  I hope he gets shot down in the Channel and drowns real slow.'\\" <br /> <br />War is hell:  \\"The two German prisoners tried to climb the steep bank behind them, but just as they got to the top, Brininstool fired his tommy gun.  Both of them slid down, whirled around, and were slammed back against the bank so hard by the .45 slugs that their eyes popped out of their sockets and hung down on their cheeks.  What kept them standing is a mystery to me, but neither one fell.  They just stood in a leaning position, side by side against the dirt wall, with arms hanging loosely at their sides.  From theexpressions on their faces they must have just looked through the open gates of hell.\\" <br /> <br />Near the end of his time in Normandy:  \\"Suddenly a strange smell came to our noses and wisps of a funny looking smoke crept over the hedges from our left.  It clung close to the ground and moved slowly toward us.  Phillips looked back at me.  His eyes were round and wide.  'Gas,' he exclaimed.  'What'll we do now?' 'Nothing,' I said.  'Just stay here and die, I guess.  I wish I had my gas mask now.'  'So do I,' said Phillips and Benson together.  They had been the first things we had thrown away.\\" <br /> <br />I did not preselect the above excerpts.  I literally spent a very few minutes leafing through the book, finding a striking passage, and typing it for you.  Burgett's experiences are all as rich as the above, about 200 pages' worth in paperback packed with such horrific stories that make one truly appreciate the sacrifices and bravery of such men in that era and, by extension, the current one. <br /> <br />My only nitpick with the book is that the author several times mentions an event without giving the result; for example, the two paratroopers who got into a drunken knife fight and were taken to the hospital by the MPs.  Their fate is never revealed beyond being taken from the bar, and surely the camp was abuzz with stories about them; for some reason, we don't know whatever became of them.  This is still a five-star book, however, because of the matter-of-fact tone and unmistakeable realism with which Burgett tells his remarkable tale.  Very highly recommended.
B00005JMUA|5.0|Does anyone know if there will be a special edition - double pack for the Kill Bill series?  Noting the lack of special features here, I think I'd rather wait for that one.  Both are great flicks, though.  Thanks.
B000000H4V|5.0|The Mighty Sepultura released Choas A.D. An Album of Tribal Metal (More so on Roots), Thrash, and Punk.  Yeah, that's right I said Punk.  I say punk in what most of the Lyrics are about.  On Territory it's about Dictators/War, and on Manifest it's Government using their power.  The Acoustic Kaiowas about; once again, government.  And the short but sweet Biotech is Godzilla Was written with Jello Biafra (Dead Kennedys anyone?).  But never Fear, this is still Sepultura, The same Attitude and Power, only more focused and the songs can get stuck in your head a lot easier.  This album is where the Whole Tribal thing really took off.  I had heard Refuse/Resist before and that Track alone, convinced me to buy it.  It was worth every cent.  Sure, the guitar solos are not Beneath the Remains or Arise Material, but they are Beautiful.  (Oh my god did he say beautiful?)  The solos flow perfectly with the songs, most noticeable Propaganda and Clenched fist.  The 4 bonus tracks are pretty cool too.  Choas B.C. is a weird Remix of Refuse/Resist by the guy who would become Soulfly's first drummer.  Kaiowas [Tribal Jam] is when they performed it in Mato Grosso, Brazil.  And The other 3 Live Songs are from the same concert as those found on Blood-Rooted with great quality, its almost like your there.  Go ahead and click the Buy button.

B000089RVX|5.0|I've been a fan of Evanescence for years and years, back in the days before \\"Fallen,\\" around the time of their \\"Origin\\" release.  (I never got one of their EPs, but I do have \\"Origin.\\")  There are a couple things about Evanescence that I would like to dispute--their originality, mainly. <br /> <br />I read reviews all the time, and I often find myself reading reviews for CDs that I already own and have an opinion of--don't know why, so don't ask.  But I can't run across any forum where Evanescence is praised where you find some hater who prefers to just rant on about, \\"Every song sounds the same,\\" or \\"I just don't see how anyone can connect to the lyrics,\\" or \\"They aren't even hard, but they want to label themselves as hard rock.  I just don't get it!\\"  Blah blah blah. <br /> <br />I have no idea where these people get off.  Evanescence, for one, has absolutely no desire to pose themselves as something they aren't.  They, as a band, are proud of who and what they are, and of how far they've come.  As Amy Lee, co-founder of Evanescence, once said in an interview, \\"[We know not everybody will like our music, but] we just want to be our own favorite band.\\" <br /> <br />I'll never understand how people can honestly believe that Evanescence has no uniqueness within its own CD.  I suppose if all you examine is the underlying rhythm of the electric guitars, you're going to find similar riffs.  For instance, the electric guitar figure in Going Under sounds similar to that in Haunted.  (Listen to the first couple of seconds of Going Under, and then the last bit of Haunted--you can hear the electric guitar better.)  But when you add solo parts, piano figures, and string arrangements--and not to mention the incredibly heart-grabbing lyrics--you come up with unparalleled, original compositions such as \\"My Immortal,\\" \\"Whisper,\\" \\"Bring Me to Life.\\" <br /> <br />I am a firm believer that every problem known to man can be temporarily, if not permanently, relieved by listening to Evanescence.  Yes, that is me--a firm believer.  Every human emotion that is prominent in today's society is mentioned.  Anger (Going Under, Haunted), betrayal (Everybody's Fool, Tourniquet in some ways), need for deliverance and salvation (Bring Me to Life, Tourniquet), love--of course (unrequited-My Immortal, in general-Taking Over Me, Bring Me to Life), the pain of death (My Last Breath, Hello), being alone (Imaginary, Whisper), the desire to just get away (Imaginary), complete and total dependence and belief (Taking Over Me, Bring Me to Life, somewhat expressed in Tourniquet)...  It's all there, and that's only on the \\"Fallen\\" album!  Evanescence has penned many many many songs in their day, and to say they all made it on \\"Fallen\\" is plain ignorance. <br /> <br />I guess all I'm trying to say is that I am a severe advocate for this band, and if you have anything to say against them, come prepared.
B000002WYT|5.0|This ranks up their with the best Cd's i have ever listened to, ranks up their with the best cds ever released. Starts off strong and just contiunes to get better. Not yet a dave fan? this is the perfect cd for you, thats one thing that makes this cd so perfect, even if you have never listened to him it sounds great. But on the other hand a long time fan will also find this to be a gem as well, although a long time fan prolly already has discovered this greatness.
B00011CZRE|3.0|Each decade has a seminal detective yarn.  In the 30's and 40's wisecracking, cynical gumshoes roamed the city.  Bogart played those cunning detectives, always in control.  In the 70's and 80's Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry tired of government bureaucracy and asked criminals if they felt lucky today before he took care of business.  And he was in control. In the Clinton 90's the maniac murderers are in control.  Morgan Freeman is reluctant to barge into the killer's apartment because he doesn't have a warrant.  Brad Pitt barges in with Dirty Harry force, but by the end of the movie he has been coerced by the murderer's cunning.  It wasn't Clinton's fault he lost control in the Oval office, and it's not Brad's fault he loses it either.  Bogart and Eastwood control the crime scene and avert mayhem by killing or capturing the bad guys.  Germany and Japan had to get a belly full of lead.  I guess those pesky terrorists have us by the b###s now. <br />
B000002GK1|5.0|Having first listened to Soundgarden's 1994 release Supreunknown - a masterpiece in its own right - I was surprised by how different Badmotorfinger sounded. Gone were the pop-rock songs like My Wave, Black Hole Sun, and Spoonman. The material on Badmotorfinger is dark, heavy, and much more metal-y than anything on Superunknown. But that's just fine, because the album is so creative and well-made, you can't help but bang your head along to the music with joy. Chris Cornell is incredible as usual - his vocals transcend into the \\"scream\\" several times during the album, but he is never off-key and his vocals are always passionate and melodic. Kim Thayil is in great form as well - almost every song features an instantly memorable guitar riff, hook, or solo. Ben Shepheard (bass) and Matt Cameron (drums) round out the quartet with a solid rhythm section.<br /><br />The album's first track, Rusty Cage, is just incredible. The zany main guitar riff is awesome, and Chris's vocals are captivating in both the fast and slow portions of the song. Outshined is possibly Soundgarden's best song ever - a great metal-sounding guitar riff, a catchy chorus, excellent vocals, and an outstanding bridge all add up to make this song a classic. Slaves and Bulldozers is another great song - slow and grungy, with plodding guitars and energetic vocals from Chris. Other standouts include the breakneck, mind-blowing Jesus Christ Pose, the fast, punky, trumpet-laced rocker Drawing Flies, the emotional, guitar-driven Mind Riot, and the near-psychadelic Searching With My Good Eye Closed, which features a half-hilarious, half-disturbing narrated intro.<br /><br />Bottom line: Badmotorfinger is awesome. Not only is it a great metal record, it features the kind of creativity only Soundgarden could pull off well - odd time signatures, saxaphones and trumpets, and eerie guitar riffs. Right up there with Nevermind, this is one of the best albums to come out of early-90s Seattle.
B0002IU988|5.0|And not a moment to soon,at that. <br />    This Alter Bridge album goes to show how strong the backing band for Creed remains and their penchant for writing and playing strong songs is still there. Myles Kennedy more than handles the task at hand and is much more of band fit than Scott Stapp ever was.. Now it's a band: not three guys and a megalomaniac with a Christ complex (Stapp). I feel sorry for Scott Stapp,though: obviously he is so delusional and ungrateful that he felt it necessary to be disloyal and leave something that got him here in the first place: Creed. No loss though. He was a dork. Now I can enjoy this album though. Myles Kennedy is a really cool fit and I wish Alter Bridge only great things. A very strong return from these guys (good for them for rehooking-up with bassist Brian Marshall) and let Scott Stapp embarass himself further with his clothing line,hooking up with some rap producer or whoever and doing that stupid 'Passion Of The Christ' soundtrack album with that other confused mess Lauryn Hill. To hell with Stapp-he's an a**hole anyway. On with the new and ever onward! Welcome back Creed sans-Stapp and here's to Alter Bridge!!
B000002BYD|5.0|This is just an all around great album that shows the true colors of pearl jam. <br />1. Brain of J- kind of a strange way to start a cd, up beat, over all not bad 7/10 <br /> <br />2.

0440238609|4.0|It's very difficult to write a review of a trilogy like this; however, I've put together some initial thoughts, ideas and questions both in response to the books and some other postings on this site.<br /><br />I do find it offensive when people are so breathtakingly critical of other people with different beliefs. Religion, no religion, apples, oranges, coffee, tea. Who cares? Much of the point of life, I find, is to find people with whom we interact, and whether that interaction is difficult or easy leads us to making 'friends'. It's such a shame that people \\"don't let\\" their children read books because of the writing; it's a shame that people say that Philip Pullman can't write. Many things are a shame.<br /><br />For one, I believe that Philip Pullman CAN write. I was finally persuaded to read this trilogy after my mother and sister badgered my into doing so. I'm glad I did. But still, at times, I found myself skim reading. Parts of the books are too long, the descriptions are wearisome, the sub-plots lengthy. That said, the 'story' makes up for it all. I was fascinated by Lyra and Will; their quest, their adventure, their relationship.<br /><br />I won't bother with a plot summary. I didn't come to read reviews to find out what happens - I wanted to know what other people thought. And it seems that we're divided - not into two (Church and anti-Church), but into 3 (Church, anti-Church, anti-Philip Pullman).<br /><br />Myself, I finished the book two days ago and I've honestly found it difficult to think about anything else. The themes are simple yet complex, and at the end of The Amber Spyglass, we are still not entirely sure of Pullman's views or what he wanted his readers to feel.<br /><br />The trilogy is fascinating and definitely worth a read. But leave some time and read it properly; don't rush it. There are too many ideas and plots and characters that it is very easy to get lost in it all.<br /><br />One more thing: we need to get over this constant need for comparison. The only resemblance to Harry Potter is the battle between Good and Evil, and maybe sacrifice. But these books are in a different world (a world like ours, but different, perhaps) to HP.<br /><br />Let's try and read books for themselves and not constantly find the need to criticize everyone with whom we don't agree.onstant need for comparison.

0767827902|5.0|What excites one about Texasville is that it has been made by essentially the same team as made The Last Picture Show. The surprise then is that almost nobody seems to be aware of the previous film, though, in the case of the performers, they were in it, and though, and most damning, in the case of the director, he made it.  Perhaps there is no way to follow up or catch up with these characters.  MacMurtry has a better and more honest chance at it because it is only on the page. The first thing one notes is that Texasville is not shot in black and white as The Last Picture Show was. To do so would be a mistake; color was \\"too pretty\\" for the original, but these sequel needs to be pretty. Less glum, less oppressed, but therefore less than... The hyper realism of The Last Picture Show is replaced by a not completely light hearted series of set pieces.  We're looking at a comedy-romance this second time around.  And on its own terms, it might be all right.  The problem is the two movies do not present the same the world, not even a world where twenty years have passed.  Texasville is full of contrivances, from Junior roping the oil well to the kids starting an egg war. There was no such contrivance in The Last Picture Show.  Though both films have wonderful performers, Texasville is marred by its children performers, especially the twins, who are acting cute for the camera, and Jimmy Howell, who plays Duane's son, is fairly awful and impossible to believe as someone that the girls just fall all over (\\"one in a million\\").  His heroics contrast sharply with the realistic vision offered by The Last Picture Show in which none of the boys were really heroes; they didn't win football games; they didn't really get all the girls; they were bumbling around.  Only one of them still bumbles and only his story suggests the heavy sadness that hangs over the original, and that is Sonny.   It's worth noting that Cybil Shepard has not aged well; she looks good, but not when you remember her from The Last Picture Show and Taxi Driver, when she was terribly beautiful.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Of course this is a great collection of songs, but it's not the essencial Beatles. You're not getting many of the really best John's songs (say \\"Norwegian Wood\\", \\"Nowhere Man\\", \\"In My Life\\", \\"Strawberry Fields\\", \\"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds\\", \\"I Am The Walrus\\" and \\"Revolution\\"); Paul is quite well represented, though you're missing some of his classics (for example, \\"Michelle\\", \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\" and \\"Back In The USSR\\"); and there's only one George's song (no \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" and \\"Here Comes The Sun\\"). I think the Red and Blue albums are truly essencial, but you'd have to buy four CDs instead of one. What I think it would have been better to do is a two CDs collection (with a total of 40 songs, 20 songs in each CD), something between \\"1\\" and the \\"Red and Blue\\" albums. I would have call them \\"The Beatles Collection\\" and even use the same colors. Here is the tack listing I suggest: <br /> <br />The Beatles Collection 1 (red): 1) Love Me Do; 2) Please Please Me; 3) From Me To You; 4) She Loves You; 5) I Want To Hold Your Hand; 6) Can't Buy Me Love; 7) A Hard Day's Night; 8) I Feel Fine; 9) Ticket To Ride; 10) Yesterday; 11) Help!; 12) We Can Work It Out; 13) Day Tripper; 14) Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown); 15) Nowhere Man; 16) Michelle; 17) In My Life; 18) Paperback Writer; 19) Eleanor Rigby; 20) Yellow Submarine. <br /> <br />The Beatles Collection 2 (blue): 1) Strawberry Fields Forever; 2) Penny Lane; 3) Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band; 4) With A Little Help Fom My Friends; 5) Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds; 6) All You Need Is Love; 7) I Am The Walrus; 8) Hello, Goodbye; 9) Magical Mystery Tour; 10) Lady Madonna; 11) Hey Jude; 12) Revolution; 13) Back In The USSR; 14) While My Guitar Gently Weeps; 15) Get Back (single version); 16) The Ballad Of John And Yoko; 17) Here Comes The Sun; 18) Come Together; 19) Something; 20) Let It Be (single version). <br /> <br />I included all the official A-side singles (in chronological order), some of the best/well known B-sides and some of the best/well known songs from albums. From \\"1\\" I didn't include \\"Eight Days A Week\\" and \\"The Long And Winding Road\\", since they're not official singles and I think there're songs that are more essencial than them. Of course I'm missing many of my favourite tunes (like \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" or \\"Dear Prudence\\"), but I tried to be objective. In fact I burned both of this CDs (from the original albums) and listening to them is a magical mystery experience!
B000002U82|5.0|This is what makes Pink Floyd who they are, this CD will no doubt go down in history as one of the best ever. Besides the radio favorites time and money the entire cd is just pure amazing music, don't take my word for it, do your self a favor and buy it and listen to it from start to finish, and by the time you have finished you will realize what i realized after i did that, it is a godly collection of music that is missing nothing and will go on being this way for ever.
B00005Q4GV|4.0|<br />Patton, released in 1970, is said to be one of the greatest war films of all times even some 34 years later.  George C. Scott is so convincing as Patton that you forget he is acting.  At nearly 3 hours, it won seven Academy Awards.  Patton, a crazy yet brave General of World War II is a man who's entire being evolves around war and his ego.  Director Franklin J. Schaffner ensures that the audience sees General Patton not only as the fiery tyrant who believes he is the reincarnation of Alexander The Great, but also how soft-skinned he is.  In the end, the audience has a genuine love-hate relationship with this General who while is respected above all others by the Germans would waste a soldier's life to feed his own ego.  This film, full of death, destruction, and action is just what any man could have ordered in a film.  While others are notable in the film including, Karl Malden as Gen. Omar N. Bradley, Scott completely overshadows everyone else.  I rate this color, VHS film, from Fox Home Entertainment, as 4 stars and agree that it deserves the awards it has won. <br />
B00006IUL7|3.0|Insomnia vs Insomnia.  The differences in the two versions-both of which are quite good-illustrate the difference in cultural consciousness.  An American audience-like a Scandanavian one-is willing to accept an ambiguous protagonist.  And both versions offer one.  An American audience-like a Scandanavian one-is willing to accept a protagonist on the edge.  And both versions offer one.  The difference is in the depth of the ambiguity-American audiences will only go so far in accepting a hero with an uncertain morality.  In the Norwegian version: main character wants the girl in the car and takes a bit of her; kills the dog (it's found dead in the American version); saves nobody but himself (rescues the female cop in the American version); and is identified with the killer more clearly especially at the key moment when he loses control of himself with the counter girl at the hotel.  All of this is essentially gone in the American version, neatly filled in by the IA investigation back story...Not a fundamental flaw, not damning like The Vanishing vs The Vanishing, but it is clear that Nolan new he couldn't get as murky as he did in his first outing...
B00029LNHS|3.0|Every once in a while a song comes along that seems to hit the top 40 and have something intelligent to say. In this case it would be BEP's \\"Where Is The Love\\". It caught my attention and stood out from all the other mundane fluff on the radio, MTV and VH1. It could be classified alongside such classic commentaries as The Temptations' \\"Ball Of Confusion\\" or The O'Jays' \\"For The Love Of Money\\" or Marvin Gaye's \\"Inner City Blues\\" or even such standards as \\"Do They Know It's Christmas?\\" and \\"We Are The World\\". I always enjoy a pop song that has a brain.<br /><br />So, how is the rest of the album? Well, I felt several of the songs were definitely aimed at the teen crowd such as \\"Hands Up\\", \\"Let's Get Retarded\\", \\"Hey Mama\\", \\"Shut Up\\", \\"Smells Like Funk\\" and others. I'm a little too experienced and old for such comedic fodder, but the melodies of the songs were what count. Catchy, infectious and certainly positive messages carry \\"Elephunk\\" to the very end. BEP's certainly cover the gamut utilizing no less that three different languages and five musical styles including funk, hip hop, rap, rock, Latin and dance.<br /><br />However, what made \\"Elephunk\\" a good, but average album was the over-production of the songs. Many of these songs could easily fit in on a J-Lo, Fugees, Sean Paul, or other hip hop flavor of the month group. In the years to come this cd will age itself compared to the band's other material. So, \\"Elephunk\\" may best be remembered for \\"Where Is The Love\\" and \\"Hey Mama\\" and that's it. As a side note, (and this will date myself) I could not help but find an inadvertant similarity between the melody of \\"Smells Like Funk\\" and Taco's 1982 cover of \\"Puttin' On The Ritz\\". I dare anyone to listen to both songs and not hear the distinct similarity. \\"If you're blue and you don't know where to go to why don't you go where fashion sits. Puttin' on the ritz.\\"
0743454529|2.0|This book was recommended to me by a number of people.  It was a well-written and very compelling read.  However, I thought the ending was completely false and was created with shock value in mind.  I didn't expect a happy ending, but a realistic one.  I was disappointed with this book.  I just finished The True and Outstanding Adventures of the Hunt Sisters by Elisabeth Robinson.  It deals with similar themes and it just felt so much more true to me.  Buy that one instead.
1400032717|5.0|Autism is not a mental illness. It is a neurological disorder. This is a very important distinction. Autistic people may have sensory disorders, social and communicative limitations, but are not mentally ill. In fact, no two Autistic people are alike in how the disorder presents itself. As a disorder that is appearing by leaps and bounds and without apparent warning, it is important that we understand Autism to be alert for early warning signs in children and to support and help those who do and will develop autism.
B0000027F8|5.0|George Michael really showed that he had true talent with this album, beyond the hits enjoyed as part of the Wham! duo and his \\"Faith\\" album.  Musically, lyrically, and vocally, each and every track here still stands the test of time and has yet to sound dated (with the exception of Soul Free, which contains many gimmicks that clearly identify the time period...but it's still good). <br /> <br />No matter what kind of drama George Michael went through with his record label...no matter what unfortunate choices he may have made in his personal life...the man remains one of pop music's greater talents.  If he never recorded anything BUT \\"Listen Without Prejudice Volume I,\\" he would still have earned his place among music's greats.   <br /> <br />Like another reviewer, I'm also waiting for Volume 2!
B00006JSS8|3.0|Good compilation of songs onto one CD but the sound quality is lacking.  It doesn't sound digitally remastered.
B0000507QH|5.0|I watched this movie having seen a trailer on another DVD.  My stomach was in knots for most of the movie.  I really felt all the emotions the main character Martin was feeling.  I went through a divorce and a relationship right after which was much like his relationship with Cecelia.  She even looked like Cecelia, who to be honest I thought was attractive.  Not built like a 12 year old boy like most Hollywood actresses.  To each his own.  But I could totally see why Martin was obsessing over her and there were so many times I yelled at the TV to STOP, IT'S GOING TO KILL YOU.  And it almost did. <br /> <br />I have felt exactly like Martin and it was painful then and was painful to watch.  I give this 5 stars, because for once a movie evoked strong emotion.  I NEVER want to see this movie again but it was gutwrenching.   <br /> <br />Hollywood produces really terrible movies compared to the French.  Unfortunately, the French believe love has to be painful. <br />
B0000C8AVR|5.0|There are many great Bob Dylan albums out there, each with its own special traits. Highway 61 stands out because it's one of the most straightforward and easy-to-enjoy albums in Dylan's diverse catalog. From the classic lead single, \\"Like A Rolling Stone,\\" to the weaving and winding closer, \\"Desolation Row,\\" there's nothing here to break up the flow of what is, at its core, a nearly perfect rock record. Gems like \\"Tombstone Blues,\\" \\"Ballad of a Thin Man,\\" and the title track pop up throughout a tight album that has no low points. <br /> <br />The loving SACD restoration of this album has made the piano clearer and brighter, enlivened Dylan's vocals, and allowed intricate guitar playing, particularly that on \\"Desolation Row,\\" to emerge from what was once a murky mix. Better yet, all of this is apparent even on the CD layer of the disc, making this a great buy for dedicated audiophiles and casual listeners alike.
B00005R62K|5.0|The critics label quite a few albums as \\"the first heavy metal ever\\". Mostly they are wrong. Because the first true pure heavy metal album in music history is this, \\"Stained Class\\" by Judas Priest. This is exactly the kind of music that is called heavy metal even now, 26 years after its release, fast, furious, with dual-guitar attack, plenty of riffs and a killer rhythm section.    This album is the 4th in JP's long discography. Only two participants changed since their previous offering, \\"Sin After Sin\\". Deep Purple's Roger Glover was substituted by Dennis MacKay as the producer, and Les Binks took his place behind the drum-kit. And it worked! The rhythm section found heavy groove and tightness, with some tasty variety. Overall, the band finally shook off Deep Purple-like sound and riffing, and presented itself as a style-defining force, a founder of what was soon called New Wave of British Heavy Metal.    \\"Exciter\\" is the epitome of everything good in this style of music. Fast, with superb riffing and inventive drumming, with Rob Halford's trademark ripping vocals, this song was any live show favorite for many years since. The harmonized dual-guitar solo in the middle is one of the most genre-defining melodies, and to my best knowledge this is where it was used first. Classic!  \\"White Heat Red Hot\\" slows down just a little bit, and demonstrates some very interesting two-guitars interplay. Soaring vocals and shout along chorus adds to this yet another template for a heavy metal song.  \\"Better By You, Better Than Me\\" is a Spooky Tooth song, which JP recorded because their record label wanted to have a cover song as a possible single. Surprisingly, it turned out to be another fan-favorite. Its melodics blended with the Priest's new found style just perfectly. The slow ending with Halford's emotional singing and mixed in high back-vocals nearly makes my heart stop.  \\"Stained Class\\" is yet another heavy metal classics. Glenn Tipton and K.K. Downing demonstrate the effect of galloping guitars, to be copied over and over by hundreds of bands ever since. This song gives us another strong performance by Halford. Just listen to the bridge part, where he takes over the rhythm pattern and accentuates every third note with peculiar vocal overtones!  The following 3 tracks fall short somewhat, since they mostly combine all the stylistic elements of the previous songs, but the songwriting is less sharp. They are good, just not on par with other timeless classics, of which there are so many in this album.  With \\"Beyond the Realms of Death\\" we have another mindblowing song from the founding fathers of metal! This is a ballad with some really heavy riffing in choruses, a very effective track and a must to hear! One more all-time favorite.  \\"Heroes End\\" is a mid-tempo track, simplistic to the first listen, but with some hidden gems.    This remastered edition of \\"Stained Class\\" also includes two excellent bonus-tracks. One, \\"Fire Burns Below\\", recorded sometime in 1987, is an impressive emotional slow rocker, reminiscent of slow song \\"Blood Red Skies\\" from \\"Ram it Down\\" album. Halford shines! The other one is a capture of \\"Better By You, Better Than Me\\" performed live.    Now, if you're still hesitant whether you should own a copy of this recording, let me just tell you that you can buy \\"Stained Class\\" alone and effectively skip the next 6 years of metal music altogether (excluding Iron Maiden). It's all played here.    PS People from Amazon.com, what have you been thinking?! If this album doesn't deserve the \\"Essential Album\\" badge, then I don't know what CD does.
B00005JLKN|2.0|I think they did a poor casting for this movie. Edward Norton is a great actor, but this part (Graham) just doesn't fit him at all. Also, Ralph Fiennes, good looking guy, playing Francis Dolarhyde??? It doesn't make sense. <br />Michael Mann (director of Manhunter) is a genious, the way he goes deep on each character and the music (check Miami Vice), the perfect song for each scene, man! it's everything this one lacks of. <br />Compare Manhunter with Red Dragon, compare the scene of Francis and Reba at the vet, with the tiger, with whichever scene of Red Dragon. You'll see.
B000001A9P|5.0|Stevie Wonder live. WOW! Plus, he has an orchestra behind him!! Am I in heaven or what?? Stevie's music is so rich, emotional and far reaching that it's amazing that he hasn't used an orchestra behind him before. My ONLY regret with this album is that there is not one song on it from his most orchestral work, Journey Through The Secret Life Of Plants. I know it wasn't a big seller but several songs would have worked in this concert. Black Orchid, the title tune Secret Life Of Plants and he could have even added an instramental interlude if you will of Tree from the album. That is a minor beef and I wouldnt want it to effect your interest in buying the album because it is great. There are 5 standout songs on it so I'll focus on them in this review. Dancing to the Rhythm: A great surprise. For the past decade and a half, Stevie has traditionally opened his concerts with Loves In Need Of Love Today, the classic opener to his most acclaimed album Songs In The Key Of Life. For this concert he wrote a song to highlight the orchestra backing him up for this tour. And what a song it is. Because of the orchestra I rank it as the best he's done since Living Off The Love Of The Land, the lost classic from the Jungle Fever album. The song in general is great, singing about how he was lost and only thinking of earthly things until he saw the light and began to \\"dance to the rhythm of God\\", Stevie wrote an incredible bridge section for the strings that really makes them work for their money. These are classically trained musicians so just having them see-saw through a bunch of lame ballads, which is what most artist do when they use an orchestra, would be a waste of talent. Stevie doesn't waste them AT ALL! It's a great song with a great message and great music to help make it the classic that it is. Higher Ground: Can he make this classic even better? Yes he can! By making the effects on the synth even funkier, he makes the song even more rough and tumble than it was on the great Innervisions album. Stevie has the keyboard keys churning in this one! With the added tightness of his band Wonderlove this version is even, dare I say BETTER than the original. A must hear. Overjoyed: One of Stevie's best and classic ballads is done justice on this album. Although I do have to say that the string arrangements are better on the original song, the live orchestra just takes it to a different level. Stevie's bassist, Nate Watts, has fun on the bass and makes it interesting. And Stevie's voice (though a little hoarse by this time) sounds great and his piano playing complements the strings perfectly. I think the only reason Overjoyed is on this album is because of the great use of strings it has in it. The song unfortunately was not a big hit when originally released 10 years before. What is cool is the audiences reaction when they hear the opening stains of the song. They start to cheer in anticipation! So, SOMEONE was listening after all! This album may have caused the ripple effect in making the rest of the world really understand and appreciate the great beauty and importance of Overjoyed. Thank you. My Cherie Amour: Yes! My Cherie Amour! It has become a standard but also very much overplayed on the radio and karaoke bars. On this CD though Stevie brings it back to life with a great piano part and Wonderlove's extreme tightness. Specifically, the drumline and bass really standout. It's not your 60's My Cherie Amour. Plus the audience \\"la, la's\\" along with him at several points, which to be honest, could have been left out. But it just goes to show how much of a standard this has become. I Just Called To Say I Love You: No, I haven't gone crazy! If yoo have read any of my reviews before you know that I utterly loathe this song. As I mentioned in an earlier review, it's Stevie as the \\"cheap\\" one man band because everything is done on the sythn. Even the drum part! Well, I eat my words on this album. With the live band and orchestra behind him it makes the song sound almost majestic. And, as superficial as it is, the song is an 80's staple/classic and just about everyone (except me) loved it when originally released. Because of that fact, the audience's love of the song is felt in this recording and that really helps to bring the song to a higher level of appreciation. Therefore at least on THIS CD, I LOVE this song! Natural Wonder is a treasure. Buy it, play it loudly and get lost in the Wonder that is Stevie.
B00005JMCN|5.0|Well since I am a horse person, I might get carried away---- <br /> <br />Seabiscuit is and will always be my favorite movie. But let me warn you, you will ether like this movie or you will hate this movie. I came out of the theater liking it.  <br />Seabiscuit is the true story of 3 men that find a broken down racehorse. Charales Howard life has been ruined after a quick accident and a sudden divorce. Tom Smith's world was changed when the cowboys were being replaced with the engines. Red Pollard's life had been ruined when his parents left him and he had been on his own. Together, they find this brokendown racehorse, Seabiscuit and turn him into America's hero. Seabiscuit led the way during the great dipression as he races in some of the best races in America. <br /> <br />Seabiscuit will make you cry for saddness and cheer for happiness! The movie is very moving and will touch your heart. And at the very end, you'll wish that there was more. <br /> <br />Seabiscuit is a must have movie for the horse person and for the most sensitive souls. <br /> <br />And about the PG-13 rating: I believe that the movie is okay for 12 and up. Every single reason it was rated PG-13 is in the first hour.  <br /> <br />An story of an All-American horse for the All-American people.
B0002IU988|5.0|I think this album is awsome!The comparisons between creed and alter bridge are unfair,infact alter bridge is a very different band and has the potential to be  better than creed ever was.The alter bridge sound is different compared to creed,for one it's heavier and can be dubbed as good old fashioned hard or grunge rock.Myles has a better vocal range than stapp and mark tremonti gets down to playing some awsome guitar riffs and solos.The variety on the album is over whelming from the grunge song find the real to the heavy metal track metalingus this album has everything,even claasic soft rock sounds found in songs like in loving memory and broken wings.While this album will not dissapoint creed fans it's hard to say that it wont attract other rock lovers that wern't into creed. <br />It's that good!

B0001UL7RY|5.0|When I heard \\"Let Go\\", Avril Lavigne's first album I thought that her music could not get any better (how wrong was I) because now she has proved us wrong and is more then a one hit wonder and has came up with 12 new songs which show her never ending feisty teen angst and also how she has developed as a writer, performer and singer. The album gets off to a great start with \\"Take Me Away\\" as it includes a catchy beat and the lyrics show that when she is confused she would like to be alone, which is probably like most of us would feel like. After that fast paced song the album is slowed down when \\"Together\\" starts playing but then goes into a mid-tempo when her first released song off of the album begins to play which is entitled \\"Don't Tell Me\\" and reveals how guys have done her wrong in the past and how she isn't going to take it anymore. \\"He Wasn't\\" is one of the best songs on the album because of the lyrics and also because Avril isn't playing an electric guitar but it is just her and Evan her lead guitarist playing acoustic guitars which makes it a special song because it shows a sense of purity on the album with nothing generated by computers etc. To conclude the album \\"How Does It Feel\\" has the same jist as \\"He Wasn't\\" because of the use of instruments and that it isn't a very busy song like \\"Sk8er Boi\\" was. The next song is the second released as a single from the album entitled \\"My Happy Ending\\" which describes how a guy meant everything to Avril but then they just grew apart, this song is very lovely as it ecentuates the power in Avril's voice. \\"Nobody's Home\\" is the seventh song from the album which has wonderful lyrics about being scared, confused and wanting to go home after running away and leaving behind feelings, the musical aspect of this sung is quite remarkable as I believe it is the nicely presented song because of the use of instruments and the beat, after \\"Nobody's Home\\", \\"Forgotten\\" appears with a slow beat and builds up volume, layers of sound,instruments and rhythm which show Avril's diversity with songs of such complex structure. The very mellow song of \\"Who Knows\\" suddenly bursts with adrenaline to show us that life is worth living and that to live it to your fullest no matter who or what puts you down, which is a regular subject Avril touches on in her lyrics. \\"Fall To Pieces\\" is the next song and is about Avril not wanting to fall to pieces over a guy and how much she loves him anyway because of the emotional stress of a relationship. To conclude \\"Freak Out\\" which all I have to say is pure punk and pure Avril and finally the album slips off with \\"Slipped Away\\" which is a quite upsetting track about a man (family or lover) leaving Avril by death and him being up in heaven which I believe shows Avril's emotion at her greatest. <br />\\"Let Go\\" Rocks but \\"Under My Skin\\" Rocks Harder! Ms. Lavigne has done a great job, Well Done!
B0002BO0AS|5.0|I have been an Unearth fan for about a year now and I have enjoyed thrashing to every minute of content on \\"Stings of Conscience\\" for about that long. This album, however, makes me appreciate them all over again because of the punch that it packs and it does this on so many levels.<br /><br />  \\"The Oncoming Storm\\" impresses me because of this peculiar thrash metal vibe that it has written all over it. It almost seems as if they are trying to evolve their style by adding this interesting element to their music, which is very much evident in \\"Black Hearts Now Reign\\" and \\"Zombie Autopilot\\", which brings great depth and maturity to their overpowering metalcore sound and fury. Unearth also adds another element to their work which allows us fans to hear the true instrumental talent that they have.<br /><br />  If you listen real closely to \\"Zombie Autopilot\\", you will hear an incredible solo that just drips beauty, power, and superioirity over this already powerful album. The rest is what we come to expect from Unearth, the explosive metalcore crunch that makes them the unstoppable force that they are quickly becoming. This new shine on the persona of a great metalcore act brings them closer to greatness than they probably think they can ever be.<br /><br />  \\"The Oncoming Storm\\" is worth the money for metalcore fans of all ages and races. I highly recommend this one to anyone.
B0001ZX0PG|1.0|For the life of me I could not understand one iota what the deal was with this movie.  I saw it.  The acting was way overblown, especially by Sean Penn and Tim Robbins.  The dialogue was cheezy and stilted.  I was rolling my eyes every time the 2 cops talked.  My father was a Detroit police officer for 26 years and cops do not talk full of chiches like that.  Needless to say it took every ounce of strength in my body not to walk out.  Dont waste your time on this snooze-fest.
0380789035|5.0|For decades, there has been a war in fantasy- a war between the conservative fantasists of the tradition of Tolkien, and the radicals of the party of Mervyn Peake- a war that seems to have no resolution.  Moorcock, Spinrad, Mieville, R.A. Wilson, and a host of nonconformists have turned out piles of fiction that, while often highly creative, is all-too-often weird for weirdness' sake.  On the other hand, Eddings, Jordan, G.R.R. Martin, Hickman, Salvatore, and others have boldly defended the tradiitonalist camp, cranking out the same story, over and over, with subtle modifications here and there, and the same powerful archetypal themes replayed.<br /><br />Like the main character of his own novel, Shadow, Neil Gaimon has stepped into the fray, and boldly declared that the war is over.  And there never was a war in the first place.<br /><br />\\"American Gods\\" is a boldly inventive modern fantasy that takes an ex-convict named Shadow and puts him under the wing of the mysterious Mr. Wednesday- Odin's American avatar, a warrior-god reduced to con artistry and nostalgia for the good ol' days of bloodbaths and human sacrifice.  Taking Shadow on a road trip through the midwest (and elsewhere), one meets a pantheon of traditional spirits, gods, and heroes- ranging from Anansi and Eostre to leprechauns and dwarves, Weskejak and Jonny Appleseed, and even a visit to Thoth and Anubis- all of whom have found their own unique little niche in the American landscape.  Along the way, Shadow discovers their rivals... the new gods of technology, TV, the media, and government, all working towards the elimination of the old spirits and their ways.  Behind all this hallucinogenic splendor, however, is a classic fantasy tale of destiny discovered, history repeated, and a redemptive savior in the most unlikely form.  The question, \\"Can there be peace between the old gods and the new?\\", is almost an allegory for the battle for the soul of the fantasy genre- \\"Can there be peace between the classic fantasists and the new rebels?\\"<br /><br />You can hang on Yggdrasil until you find the answer- or you can read the novel.  I suggest the latter- it's much more enjoyable, and is as mind-bending a trip as anything Wilson or Moorcock ever pulled out of their hats...e classic fantasists and the new rebels?\\" <br /> <br />You can hang on Yggdrasil until you find the answer- or you can read the novel.

B00005ASGG|5.0|This is simply one of the great movies, not just westerns, of all times. It goes to the core of what Americans value most, it's heroes. How are they created, what is a hero anyway, and in an Orwellian sense what's more important the fact or the legend? This movie is up there with Roshimon, and Blow Up as a study in reality, guilt, memory and morality.    John Ford parallels the story line with his own reassessment of his art. His characters are all there in their traditional movie persona John Wayne the two fisted, make your own law with a six gun, Jimmy Stewart the idealist of Frank Capra films Lee Marvin the dark side of the force (Wayne and Marvin yin and yang), Vera Miles the object of affection for Wayne and the complacent wife of Stewart, Andy Devine and Edmond O'Brien exceedingly flawed but amiable as ineffectual sheriff and newspaperman.   But all with a sardonic twist.     As in Shakespeare, who are the good bad and the ugly here - who really shot Vallance and does it really matter? How did this one incident change the lives of all the players and the west?    One doesn't have to be a social historian to draw parallels to many of our institutions, and public figures (heroes) in the news today.    This is, in a nutshell, great story telling!
B00009W0WM|5.0|Powerful and classical drama set in Morocco where these casualities of life will face two ex lovers , but in crude and disturbing situations , she is now a married woman with a resistance hero , while he regents a night club . The ancient memories will emerge and the drama will take two opposite directions . The inner and hidden emotions that still feel one for each other and the duty , the loyalty and the patriotic sense who meet this disturbing triangle . But Ricky is a honor (strange word in the present times do not you?) man ; he decides to help them and give all the possible shelter he can even his feelings .<br /><br />So this conflict has a double face the inner emotions about an old love who did not grow up , and the outer related with the political surround who envolves all the city . The smart chase runs for Claude Rains ( in a scorching role ) and his persuasive moods  over Ricky , and the fear for being discovered make of that film a solid gem that has overcome its own time to become in a real masterpiece through the years .<br /><br />Bogart gives a perfect performance and Ingrid Bergman is extraordinary too . The dazzling direction of Michael Curtiz is another punch point . Dooley Wilson made of As time goes by , his personal hymn. Nobody can sing like him with so nosthalgical rapture and credibleness.<br /><br />Since the film experienced three changes in its ending , (and I  really choose the tragical in which Ricky loses ) , this movie reached the immortality status all through the eternity.
B00006BTCA|4.0|I was very suprised to learn that Interpol were from New York, as they have the sound of an English band. The comparisons to Joy Division are somewhat justified, especially in some of the vocals, though there is more melody here than most Joy Division output, and their pop sensibilties show through on tracks such as 'The New' and 'PDA', the latter culminating in a glorious wall of guitars you wish would never end. <br />The production is also very good, with the bass guitar actually being allowed to be heard, which is a breath of fresh-air compared to a lot of modern over-produced bands. <br />A similar guitar style is used in a lot of the songs, which can be a little annoying, but easy forgiven as it's so good! The opening untitled track is a wonderful wave of sound which begs you to turn up the volume from the off. The only track I found tiresome is 'Stella was a diver...' which gets a bit repetative. <br />There's echos of Joy Division, The Furs, Bowie, the Bunnymen, the Cure and others but I would disagree that it has any grunge leanings, except perhaps towards a band like Sebadoh. <br />There is a slight sense of melancholy through-out, but face it- if you're looking at this you aren't looking for Britney Spears. <br />Highly recommended, especially if you're into any of the above bands.
6305648522|5.0|This film is by far , the masterpiece of Giuseppe Tornatore who made a solid , powerful and poignant story with so many implications and emotional wrenchs , that literally invades and engages the viewer all the way .<br />The ancient memories of that will never end childhood lost in the dust of the tomes will be smartly for Tornatore as device to introduce us in this fine script .<br />The song to the unitersted friendship between and old but lovely man (Phillipe Noiret , so brilliant as always) and this child ; the countless of laughable situations (remeber the sequence of the exam in which we can see that incredible and funny blackmail) or the nosthalgical mood in which the film is spread out out of the hall for being watched for the outside people, make of this film a genuine landmark in the story of the universal cinema .<br />The strong influence of Federici Fellini in that onirical images is another remarkable punch .<br />A timeless bravo for this film that rejoins us with the life!
B00006JJ1O|4.0|This isn't a review on the album. I'm sure it's good & I do plan to get it one of these days. This is really just gossip. I heard on TV that one of the girls, Julia, married her boyfriend within the past 2 weeks. So, either the lesbian thing is fake or she's bysexual. No big deal to me. Just thought I'd share that. I was surprised she married a man.
B0000DCGT4|1.0|After watching this movie I am even more convinced that the original \\"American Pie\\" film was a fluke....it worked....the other's in the series suffer from trying way too hard. <br /> <br />This film has all of the usual actors in their roles with Jason Biggs and Alyson Hannigan on their way to the altar. So while the women plan a wedding the \\"men\\" run around town still in search of sexual pleasure in all of its most inane of forms. Stifler (Sean William Scott) is full of his typical gross antics, this time with dogs, dog waste and a focus upon the only thing he seems capable of understanding.....sex. While most of the silliness and surprise of the original \\"Pie\\" film worked that same vulgar effort misses sorely in this film, basically just grossing people out with the worst of gags and a really stupid and entirely gratuitous T&A scene that could have easily been thrown on the editing floor.  <br /> <br />The filmmakers were smart enough to stay with Eugene Levy, Molly Cheek, Fred Willard and Deborah Rush as the parents who birthed all of these nincompoops! The humor found in the older actors is the only redeeming quality of this movie. Maybe on the next \\"American Divorce,\\" something will change!  <br />
1878424319|5.0|I found this to be a wonderful book filled with simple yet important messages that have helped me to be easier on both  others and myself. Some of the simplest concepts are the most difficult to apply, and yet the truth that Don Miguel Ruiz brings us all is a wonderful gift for personal and collective peace. I highly recommend this book if you are looking for answers that you can re-apply to your life to make the going easier.
0061015725|4.0|I have to say that I really couldn't put this book down and I finished the whole book in two nights. However, replaying the plot in my head now, I agree with many reviewers here that the whole story is quite predictable and the premise is pretty cliched. But this only proves one of great things about Mr. Crichton - captivating readers to a level that you don't really care if everything makes a whole lot of sense, and you just want to see what's gonna happen. As for all the technology mumbo-jumbo, I'd say skip them! I hated them as well while reading the book, and later on I realized that it really didn't matter if you could truely understand all that. All you need to know is that these particles are smart and dangerous, and you're good to go!
B0002IU988|5.0|WOW! What can one say about this album? First let's begin with the fact that I, like many of you, were upset to hear that Creed were no more. I figured it was coming, but still had hope that they needed this hiatus and would come back with a killer CD and all would be back to normal. <br /> <br />Obviously that never happened. <br /> <br />But I think what has turned out to be ALTER BRIDGE has been nothing short of amazing. Mark, Scott, and Brian together are like a fine wine that just gets better and better and the addition of Myles was perfect! Myles is a great singer with a fantastic range that when you listen to him you find yourself saying, \\"There's no way he can take this song to another level...wait...no...yes...he's gonna go there! AMAZING!\\" <br /> <br />You will find comparisons to Chris Cornell and Scott Stapp. I guess that's typical, especially since this is the first album without Scott. Make no mistake, Myles has his own voice and range. By the time ALTER BRIDGE puts out another album I'm sure all those contrasts will be gone.  <br /> <br />Overall I give this album 5 stars. The production, the sound, the songs, and MARK SHREDDING LIKE I'VE NEVER HEARD BEFORE! Out of a 5 star rating this is how I see each song: <br /> <br />1. Find The Real 4/5 <br />2. One Day Remains 5/5 To me, this is their best! <br />3. Open Your Eyes 4/5 <br />4. Burn it Down 3/5 <br />5. Metalingus 5/5 Heavy Metal Lives! <br />6. Broken Wings 4/5 <br />7. In Loving Memory 5/5 GREAT BALLAD! <br />8. Down To My Last 5/5 VERY EPIC. One of their best! <br />9. Watch Your Words 5/5 Metallica-esque. Reminds me at times of HARVESTER OF SORROW <br />10. Shed My Skin 5/5 <br />11. The End Is Here 5/5 Reminds me a little of FACELESS MAN or WHO'S GOT MY BACK. <br /> <br />There are great epic songs on this album and will just be amazing to watch live. I was fortunate enough to see CREED on the HUMAN CLAY and WEATHERED tour. They will be missed, but now we have a new day, a new chapter, anda new band and ALTER BRIDGE will be just as, if not more, incredible than CREED. <br /> <br />Run, don't walk, and get this CD at your local store TODAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  <br />
1920769005|5.0|This book is a stunning achievement. I was captivated from the opening paragraph and six days later when I finished this book I felt like a masterpiece was in my hands, my mind and had forever touched my life. This is a work of peace, forgiveness, compassion and for me as a reader inspiration. Roberts work is a tribute to the capacity of man for all things good and evil and offers a \\"western\\" view of India that is considered, open minded, articulate and intellectual.
B00005JMUA|5.0|The first time I heard someone say 'Kill Bill: Vol. 1' was better than 'Pulp Fiction,' I was immediately skeptical. I think perhaps this biased me against KB before my first viewing, and the film did little to change my mind. I enjoyed the first volume, but I felt as if something was missing... the something that made me love the characters in 'Fiction' and 'Reservoir Dogs.' I appreciated the goofy violence as comic relief, but not much more. I felt the fight scene with the Crazy 88s was cool, but entirely too long. In all, I missed Tarantino. The first movie smacked of his visual taste, but very little of the feeling typically behind it. <br /> <br />Vol. 2, however, is a different story. If you view it as a sequel, suffice it to say it's 10 times the film Vol. 1 was. If it is, as most (and undoubtedly Tarantino himself) feel, the second half of a single movie in two parts, then it validates the first half (and then some). We see more character development in the first twelve minutes than in the entire first volume, and more depth than Fiction. It's a revenge movie on the surface, of course, but at its heart is something different... something for which symptoms were completely absent from Vol. 1. At least on par with Dogs, if not better. A must-see.
B00005JMAH|5.0|When I saw Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban in theaters, I was blown away. In my opinion, this movie is MUCH better than the two previous movies. Alfonso Cuaron, the new director, did an excellent job. The artistry in the movie is fantastic! It's darker and more mature, and I absolutely love the different feel of it. Gary Oldman's portrayal of Sirius Black was outstanding! He is such a versatile actor, and the way he played Sirius is exactly as I pictured the character when reading the book. I was equally impressed with Emma Thompson's portrayal of Professor Trelawny - also exactly as I pictured the character. When did Daniel Radcliff learn how to act? In the first two HP films, he is not that great. His movements were mechanical and his facial expressions seemed a bit forced. He has improved so much! Emma Watson (Hermione) and Rupert Grint (Ron) have also improved in their acting. They, like their characters, have grown since Chamber of Secrets. I was, however, a little disappointed with Michael Gambon as Dumbledore. I just loved Richard Harris in the role; he suited it perfectly. Maybe it was the writing, but Dumbledore is like a different character in this film. He is a bit two-dimensional. Sure, he is still the wise old man who guides Harry, but very little of his charm comes through. He is supposed to be a witty, almost sarcastic man with a twinkle in his eye, and the film just does not do the character justice.  <br /> <br />Fans of the book should not watch the movie expecting a word-for-word re-enactment. There are many scenes missing that, in my opinion are important to the story (coughMARAUDERSMAPcough) and some scenes added. The budding romance between Ron and Hermione is even more evident in this movie. I, personally, could do without it, but it does make for some very funny moments.  <br /> <br />Though the movie does have its faults, I stand by my rating of 5 stars. It's impossible to make the perfect Harry Potter movie without it being 6 hourslong and incredibly expensive for WB. Overall, the movie captured all of the feelings and emotions that JK Rowling meant to with her book. I'm very happy with this movie, and I will buy it the second the DVD comes out. Until then, I will just have to listen to the soundtrack. It's excellent - highly recommended as well.
B00005JNEI|1.0|Many of the things stated in this movie have been proven to be outright lies. Moore talks about bringing out the truth and then he includes a bunch of flat out lies, to make the point he obviously can't make with the truth. He obviously is on a mission to destroy Bush and doesn't care much whether his effort is based on fact or fiction. This guy might be getting a moment of fame from democrats, but his insignificant below average talent will vanish back into obscurity soon enough. He needs a long bath and a shave, inside as well as out.
B00003CXBK|5.0|I agree with the people who say this movie is good for not having a clear \\"evil\\" side.  Yes, it takes some imagination on the part of the viewer, but it is a true masterpiece.  Never before this have I seen a movie where there really was no clear \\"good\\" side.  Great for people who like to think metephorically, or fantasy fans like myself.
B000286S8S|1.0|The same thing as 'Vol.1'. Important songs are missing ('mean street', 'mine all mine'). Just one more desperate attempt to sell more van halen albums (The same case with Rush).<br />My advice is that you should buy every VH album, except their stupid compilations, which are worthless.<br /><br />The one star goes to the cover of this album.
B000002UE1|4.0|This album has the classic closer to home. This was their first album of original material when they became a trio. I liked this album because their music style was unique and true to themselves. They were not trying to be commercial, they just played their music the way they wanted to.<BR>Their other non-commercial writing style album was e pluribus funk.<BR>Their latter albums were produced too highly with the influence of being commercial because that is how they made their living after their legal battle with their first producer. So to alleviate as much unsurety as they could, they hired commercial successful producers.<BR>This album is probably the best representation of what kind of music grand funk railroad is about.

B00009V7P8|5.0|What can one say of damien rice, other than \\"incredible,\\" \\"spectacular,\\" and \\"genius\\"? A whole lot, actually. Rice's compelling lyrics draw the listener into the world he has created through his music. Rice sings with emotion and a jaded quality that bonds him to the listener, and holds his audience captive. \\"O\\" is one of the best albums of 2003. \\"Delicate,\\" \\"The Blowers Daughter,\\" and \\"Cannonball\\" are just three gems that can be found on this album. No one who loves singer-songwriters will be unhappy that s/he purchased this CD. Completely stunning - thank you, Damien Rice, for sharing your talent with us.
B00006IUL7|3.0|AN LA DETECTIVE [AL PACINO] GOES TO ALASKA TO INVESTIGATE A TEENAGE GIRL'S MURDER. SOON, HE FINDS OUT THAT THE KILLER IS A DERANGED WRITER [ROBIN WILLIAMS] WHO BEGINS PLAYING MIND GAMES WITH HIM. THIS AMERICANIZED REMAKE OF THE 1997 SWEDISH DRAMA [I NEVER SAW THE ORIGINAL] HAS SUSPENSE AND PLENTY OF GOOD TWISTS, BUT IT JUST LACKS SOMETHING IN THE LONG RUN. IT MAKES A GOOD SUSPENSE MOVIE FOR SUSPENSE FANS. I WONDER WHAT THE ORIGINAL INSOMNIA WAS LIKE.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Stephen Schwatz's Wicked is absolutely amazing. Kristin Chenoweth (Galinda/Glinda) and Idina Menzel (Elphaba/Wicked Witch) have an incredible chemistry with their stage presence and graceful voices. Pieces such as \\"Defying Gravity\\" definitely give each bragging rights along with the moving \\"For Good\\". Joel Grey, the Wizard also is able to show off with Sentimental Man\\" and \\"Wonderful\\". This is definately a great cd to own especially because Kristin Chenoweth has recently left the show and Idina Menzel is also scheduled to leave soon as well.
B0000057C5|4.0|THIS FOLLOW-UP CD TO RAMMSTEIN'S 1996 DEBUT ''HERZELEID'' IS RAMMSTEIN'S BEST CD TO DATE. SINGING IN THEIR NATIVE LANGUAGE, WHICH IS GERMAN, THIS CD IS ONE OF THE BEST METAL CDS TO EVER COME FROM A NON-AMERICAN BAND! THE BEST SONGS ARE THE ENERGETIC ''DU HAST'', ''BUCK DICH'', ''TIER'', ''SPIEL MIT MIR'', AND A COVER OF DEPECHE MODE'S ''STRIPPED'' [WHICH IS IN ENGLISH AND IS A BONUS TRACK ON SOME VERSIONS OF THIS CD]. A GOOD FUN METAL CD TO ANYONE WHO LIKES HEAVY METAL. AND BE AWARE THAT MANY DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THIS ALBUM IS FLOATING AROUND ON THE MARKET. THERE'S A VERSION WHICH HAS AN ENGLISH VERSION OF ''DU HAST'' AND ''ENGEL'', THERE'S A VERSION WHICH HAS THE SONG I WAS TALKING ABOUT, ''STRIPPED'' [WHICH IS THE VERSION I HAVE], AND THERE'S A CHRISTMAS VERSION OF THIS ALBUM THAT HAS 3 BONUS TRACKS, INCLUDING A ''DU HAST'' REMIX.
B000000OQF|5.0|in 1987, when this album was released, the music scene was dominated by bands such as poison and cinderella. these bands were both hair eightys rock bands and in my opinion some of the worst music ever made. then in came Guns N' Roses with the debut album, and there best one, Appetite for Destruction. this album brought back the bad boy image to rock n roll. every time you saw Guns N' Roses on TV they were drunk. this in a way was extremely refreshing. with great lyrics by Axle Rose and amazing guitar by Slash, Appetite for Destruction was one of the key factors of the downfall of crapy hair eightys rock n roll. three key tracks on this album one Welcome to the Jungle. it isn't so much a song as it is an experience. two Sweet Child O' Mine. with a dorky guitar riff and heartfelt lyrics this song was the most unlike Guns N' Roses. and three, the best song on this album is Nightrain. this song directly describes everything that Guns N' Roses were about.

DEFINITELY NOT IN THE SAME LEAGUE AS ITS PREDECESSOR, BUT IT'S PRETTY DECENT. AT LEAST THE ACTING IS STILL GOOD. IF YOU STILL HAVEN'T SEEN THIS SEQUEL, IT'S OK TO WATCH, IF YOU'RE CURIOUS ABOUT HOW THIS MOVIE IS LIKE. BUT, THE SEQUELS WOULD GET WORSE AND WORSE AFTER THIS. SO IN ALL SERIOUSNESS, THIS IS THE LAST OF THE WATCHABLE MOVIES IN THIS SERIES.
0792841344|2.0|Jeezus!  <br />This movie is boring and the kid is annoying and the tall man is not scary. So, now you know...
B0001ZX0PG|5.0|\\"Mystic River\\" is an instant classic with phenomenal performances by its entire cast, from the star trio of Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon, all the way down to the three youngsters who play them as children in the opening sequence.      If director Clint Eastwood never made another movie, \\"Mystic River\\" would serve as the same kind of cinematic swan song John Wayne achieved with \\"The Shootist.\\"  Meticulously crafted and perfectly cast, the film packs an incredible wallop, from the beautifully shot opening scenes that set up the incredible tragedy to follow, to the well-staged parade sequence that leads to a haunting fade-out.  One thing is certain: it is impossible not to think about and discuss all that has been witnessed, and that's what great films are all about.  Yes, Eastwood and screenwriter Brian Helgeland leave out one crucial piece of dialog from Dennis Lehane's novel, and yes that omission leaves the viewer in limbo as to the story's outcome, but it is done on purpose, since what happens between Penn's and Bacon's characters in the future is not important.  What is important is what has happened to that point.  It should come as no shock to anyone that Eastwood's favorite film (as he has said in the past) is \\"The Ox-Bow Incident,\\" which explores the futility of violent revenge and mob justice, since his two masterworks, \\"Unforgiven\\" and \\"Mystic River\\" both deal with this very issue.      Actually, I am avoiding discussing the plot for good reason:  for once I don't want to spoil a single moment of a film for anyone.  Suffice it to say, it is one of the most eloquent statements against child abuse and for the importance of dealing with childhood trauma I have ever seen, embodied by the sad, broken shell of a man played beautifully by Robbins.  He is matched by the epitomy of uncontrolled fury that is Penn's Jimmy Markum.  Whether or not you believe Penn's performance is the best in decades, like some critics have suggested, one thing is certain:  heand Eastwood have achieved the kind of legendary collaboration that evokes the memory of Elia Kazan and Marlon Brando in \\"On the Waterfront\\" or, more recently, Martin Scorcese and Robert DeNiro in \\"Taxi Driver,\\" \\"Mean Streets\\" and \\"Raging Bull.\\"  And the rest of the cast is on the same level:  Bacon and Laurence Fishburne as police detectives investigating the murder of Penn's daughter, former child star Tom Guiry, in an eye-opening role as chief suspect and boyfriend of the dead girl, and, especially, Laura Linney and Oscar nominee Marcia Gay Harden as Penn's and Robbins' wives.  Linney, in particular, has the film's knockout (and most discussed/maligned) scene in which she evokes the spirit of Lady MacBeth to justify Penn's actions, while Harden beautifully underplays the role of tortured spouse who suspects her husband of a heinous act.      As far as Eastwood's direction, it is simply beyond reproach, justifying his \\"Unforgiven\\" Oscar.  In fact, these two films make a great double feature, since the themes are similar.  Helgeland skillfully adapted Lehane's novel with economy and impeccable instincts on what to leave intact and what to streamline.  Joel Cox's editing is crisp and professional, and the production design is stunning--notice how everything, including the clothing and interior furnishings are in colors of blue and dark gray, to reflect the ever-present river in which all the secrets of the film are buried.  This color scheme is so subtle that while it's obvious the film has a blue hue to it, it wan't until a second viewing that I noticed why.  And while many viewers hate the Eastwood-penned music, I find it absolutely inobtrusive and appropriate to the mood of the piece.    In all, \\"Mystic River\\" is an absolute masterpiece and one of the few films in recent memory that deserves to stand alongside the great dramas of the early '70's, including \\"Chinatown\\" and \\"The Conversation.\\" (\\"The House of Sand and Fog\\" is another.)     As far as the DVD goes, splurge and buy the three-disc special edition, which includes a beautiful wide-screen transfer, a CD with Eastwood's score (and two great jazz tracks by son Kyle), and a disc of extras including two informative documentaries and complete Charlie Rose interviews with Bacon, Robbins and Eastwood that were recorded at the film's release.  Also, Robbins and Bacon contribute a commentary track where they discuss Eastwood's directorial style, which they found refreshing and beyond reproach.  The non-special edition DVD simply contains a widescreen (or pan-and-scan) print and nothing else, so it's hardly worth the effort.  Verdict:  ***** for the film and the special edition DVD; ***1/2 for the regular edition (film *****, DVD **)
B0000CABBW|5.0|What a wonderful movie! By turns heartwarming and absolutley devastating. Keisha Castle-Hughes is amazing, so talented to convey so much pathos at such a young age!  <br />See the Movie!
B000002VCQ|5.0|Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP, called simply Whitney Houston, had four number one singles on it?  Did you know that, Christy?  It's hard to choose a favorite among so many great tracks. But \\"The Greatest Love of All\\" is one of the best, most powerful songs ever written; about self-preservation, dignity. Its universal message crosses all boundaries and instills one with the hope that it's not too late to better ourselves. Since, Elizabeth, it's impossible in this world we live in, to empathize with others. We can always empathize with ourselves. It's an important message. Crucial really, as beautifully stated on the album.
B00006879E|5.0|I honestly never thought I'd like the whole album, but once I got it I knew I was wrong. This album is amazing, it has great vocals and all the songs have great lyrics. It's one of those albums where you can listen to it and listen to it and still never get tired of the songs. From my opinion, this is how I would rat the songs, 10 being the best, 1 the worst. <br /> <br />1. Harder To Breathe - 9/10 <br />2. This Love - 9/10 <br />3. Shiver - 8.5/10 <br />4. She Will Be Loved - 10/10 <br />5. Tangled - 10/10 <br />6. The Sun - 7/10 <br />7. Must Get Out - 8.5/10 <br />8. Sunday Morning - 8/10 <br />9. Secret - 8.5/10 <br />10.

B000002GJ7|1.0|\\"More Than Words\\" was one of the Most Overplayed songs of 1991, and one of the Most (if not THE MOST) Annoying and Most Boring songs of ALL TIME!  Just when You're thinking the song is finally over, it just keeps going, and going, and going...  If You're in the mood to Hang Yourself, buy this album and listen to that track about 2 or 3 times. \\"ExtremeLY\\" Annoying!

B000002VMD|5.0|This is one of my favorite soundtracks. All of the songs are winners.   Of course, the standout songs are from Whitney.  To this day Whitney's ballads hit my very soul.  \\"I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU\\",\\"I HAVE NOTHING\\",\\"RUN TO YOU\\" I think anyone who believes in a lifelong love can relate to these songs.  \\"QUEEN OF THE NIGHT\\" and a Chaka Khan remake \\"I'M EVERY WOMAN\\" are great for the dance floor.  \\"TRUST IN ME\\" is a great rock song from legend Joe Cocker.  \\"SOMEDAY\\" from the other diva Lisa Stansfield is a mild dance number (I also recommend Lisa's entire catalog).  \\"EVEN IF MY HEART WOULD BREAK\\" with Kenny G and Aaron Neville is an adult contemporary sound of Aaron Neville with Kenny on sax.  \\"WHAT'S SO FUNNY..\\" with Curtis Stigers is a rock dance feel.  \\"LOVELY DAY\\" by Soul System is a typical Clivilles and Cole club dance sound. \\"THEME FROM THE BODYGUARD\\" is an instrumental song with a relaxful sound.  Buy this soundtrack.  My other favorite soundtrack is \\"WAITING TO EXHALE\\" which is a diva extravaganza!!: WHITNEY,CHAKA,PATTI,TLC and more.
B00000K3D4|5.0|I almost gave this movie four stars, until I realized how many times I've come back to it. It really is worth watching again and again.<br /><br />The story's opening should appeal to many kids: teenaged Sara rebels at the baby-sitting duties that interfere with her vivid fantasy life. She would never hurt the child, but creates a fairy tale around her frustration. In this story, the beautiful princess (Sara, of course) is set free when denizens of Fairy-land abduct the evil infant. Then, suddenly, the fairy tale becomes real.<br /><br />The story is Sara's quest to recover the lost child from Jared, played by David Bowie. He works well as the world's dark lord, even if his song scenes seemed gratuitous. Sara traverses the mythic Labyrinth guided, misguided, and befriended by beings from Jim Henson's wonderful imagination. This is the true magic of \\"Labyrinth,\\" the sustained vision, comical and fantastical, of Brian Froud's world peopled by Henson's creatures. The whole world is simply amazing - and it goes on, in changing scenes and amazing detail, for the rest of the movie.<br /><br />This is a wonderful kids' movie, with no real violence or adult themes, and with a happy ending. It does have a dark edge, however, that may scare the very youngest. Although it's a kids' movie, the kids are optional. Feel free to enjoy it just for yourself.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B0001L3LUE|4.0|Erroll Morris--you can't argue with his amazing mind, his interviewing technique or his choice of  subjects. He has been one of the most creative, ground-breaking  doc directors in Amerca ever. I have nothing but praise and kudos for his work. <br /> <br />One big question however. In this film he adopts the style of Godfrey Reggio's ...Qatsi films. The style is so unique and specific to Reggio's films that I have no idea why Morris felt the need to copy it when he has long established his own style. A big puzzle to this ardent fan.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|Like in the first two installments, Howard Shore has created an epic, intimate, and classical score, yet urban in many ways too. This is one of those scores that work well in both film and soundtrack album. Highly recommended if you like a film score that is grand, intimate, and very emotional. Shore creates the emotional tracks very well during the last three tracks of the album. It's not really bombastic, but very restrained, which is very moving if you knew what was going on in the film. This album is sure to be a future classic, and definitely deserved the Best Musical Score award from the Academy Awards and Golden Globe Awards.
0553381407|5.0|This wonderful book validates the very real abuse scars left on abuse victims without laying the additional burden of \\"you HAVE to forgive\\" or \\"Just get over it\\" or \\"simply stop being a victim/feeling sorry for yourself\\" or even worse, \\"why dwell on it? That was years ago\\" that so many abuse victims get from well-meaning friends and relatives. If you haven't been abused, you just don't get it and never will. Also exposes the many too-simplistic forms of \\"therapy\\" that survivors are often confronted with: religion as a cure-all, forgiveness.... Her advice for true healing is practical and a welcome effort to those so scarred by their childhoods. It ain't always \\"the best years of your life.\\"
055357342X|5.0|Simply the best swords & sorcery on the market today. Martin dispenses with the folderol and shows us the beef.

B00005JLEU|5.0|Wow!!!!! What an adventure! What a story! What a fantasy! I wish I could watch this animation when I was young like Chihiro! But even now being 28 years old, I am impressed.... So, what's special in this movie? Why everybody likes it?<br /><br />1) Well, first of all, there is a very unusual story. It's just not what you expect from fairytales or what you are accustomed to expect from fairytales. The story is intriguing and is absolutely unpredictable. Each next scene will make your eyes and mouth remain wide. That's why you'll be glued to the screen the whole 2-hour time while the movie goes. So, I am not going to tell you what's the story is about, as I want you to be excited in the same way I was when I watched it for the first time...<br /><br />2) Humour. There are plenty of moments there, which will make you laugh. The humour is very intelligent and that's why it's very pleasant and enjoyable. In the course of the movie you'll see various characters. Most of them will make you smile without saying a word!<br /><br />3) Main characters. I don't know whether you've seen already \\"Tokyo Godfathers\\". If yes, then you know how quality drawn characters can be. The 10-year old Chihiro is so real here. Well, actually, my favourite character there is not Chihiro, but wonderful granny Yubaba!!! Oh, she is so cool and witty! Quite a special character I must say, but so lovely! She is so smart and funny that I wish she could be my grand mother!!!<br /><br />4) Music. You know, with such an original score, you don't really need to watch anything. Just listen to this masterpiece of the famous Japanese composer Joe Hisaishi!!!! Splendid! You will not hear a single electronic sound, but what you'll hear are beautiful orchestral, piano and violin themes. This movie got rich and quality soundtrack.<br /><br />5) English dubbing. I compared both English and Japanese dialogues, and I must admit that the version with English dubbing is far better than the version in original language. I noticed that characters' emotions and intonations do properly sound  situation-wise in the English version of the movie. For example the loving caring voice of \\"English\\" Yubaba when she talks to her baby is much more convincing than the one of \\"Japanese\\" Yubaba...<br /><br />Conclusion: this movie is a masterpiece. I am very happy I watched it and I am glad I got this DVD.and intonations do properly sound  situation-wise in the English version of the movie. For example the loving caring voice of \\"English\\" Yubaba when she talks to her baby is much more convincing than the one of \\"Japanese\\" Yubaba...    Conclusion: this movie is a masterpiece.

B0002IU988|4.0|I was a huge Creed fan since the true day #1 and im happy to see the guys are back and still rockin. I got the album the morning it came out and have spun it a few times and i really enjoy it. One Day Remains is \\"straight out of the box rock and roll\\". no gimicks, no adolecent whinning, just fantastic rock! <br /> <br />however i am inclined to make this observation: have you ever been to a raging party where there was one guy who THOUGHT he was with the party but really wasnt? enter myles kennedy. the musicianship on this album is STRONG...scott and brian have been reunited and thier playing has been given a lighting bolt of energy...and mark is at the top of his game given the new freedom to play and write what he wants. but it sometimes feels like myles just cant keep up with them. as hard as he may try, the highnotes and \\"oooohs\\" get annoying and, therefore, lost. he has some shinning moments but in the grand scheme of things its like a stick-figure joining the national sumo-wrestling team; just doesnt seem to fit.
076790592X|5.0|It has been a long time since I read a book that impacted me the way that Tuesdays with Morrie has.  It is an absolutely beautiful account of what is important in life, and is written in a simple, touching fashion.<br />There are too many good things I could say about this book, and space does not allow me to give it the full praise it deserves.  Suffice it to say that this book is worth a read - so go read it.  It is not the type of book that you have to invest a lot of time into reading; it is short and sweet.  Even those who are not avid readers will find it easy to get through.  So do yourself the favour... don't think, just read.<br />Morrie's philosophies inspire me greatly.  I hope that they will do the same for anyone who chooses to pick up the book.  Whether you are looking for psychology, sociology, religion, philosophy, or just a thoughtful read - I have no doubt that you will enjoy this novel.
B00005JMAH|3.0|I am an adult and a huge Harry Potter fan at that. I must admit that I was disappointed with this movie. It strayed from the book so much that key elements were missing. If you hadn't read the Prisoner of Azkaban you wouldn't understand a majority of the movie and what made the book so special. Everything was out of whack and sequence. Fellow reviewers have already mentioned particular instances of which I speak. The cinematography of the first two movies is beyond amazing. This new director tried too hard to make the Prisoner of Azkaban \\"spooky\\" by making the entire movie grainy. It bothered me. The first two movies looked so magical and this movie didn't even come close that capturing that same essence. The Prisoner of Azkaban was by no means a horrible movie, but it certainly wasn't as good as it should have been.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|I saw Lost in Translation with exceptionally high hopes.  I've loved Bill Murray's 'serious' roles, and the reviews had me at high anticipation. <br /> <br />Not since the English Patient have I been left scratching my head so feverishly trying to figure out what the whol fuss was about.  Don't get me wrong...it's not a BAD movie.  I refer to it as a Chinese Dinner Film:  I know I've been to a film...just don't feel like I've SEEN a film. <br /> <br />The story is about two strangers who 'bond' over shared 'fish out of water' in their location and their lives.  Bill Murray is typical Bill Murray, and Johansen is deft.  But the story is blah, and the performances, while good, are certainly nothing I would have been offering up kidneys for, as so many critics seemed to do.  Again...it's not a bad film...but the hype, I suppose, probably lead to the majority of my disappointment with the film.  I expected far more than was delivered. <br /> <br />Maybe this is one of those films that translates a much more intimate feel on a smaller screen, so perhaps the DVD version might add someting the big screen robbed it of. <br /> <br />But I'm not holding my breath.
B00005JMAH|3.0|Personally I liked this movie in comparision to the two previous ones (Which I really liked).  The biggest problem I have with the movie comes from the fact that I had read the books so many times there were things I wanted to see. <br /> <br />I had never read the books when I'd seen the 1st 2 movies, so they were wonderful in my eyes, & even now not much seems missing between book & movie.  However POA being my favorite book was really screwy... <br /> <br />I think a lot more needed to be explained & more scenes from the book kept in.  If you didn't read the books then you really have no idea about the Marauders map or its creators, which is important to realize why Harry's dad appeared in the form of a stag. <br /> <br />I really missed the bit about Harry getting the Firebolt taken from him when he received it for Christmas.  To put something like that at the end of the movie somehow seemed really wrong.  The movie is a jumble of scenes from the book (& new ones) rearranged quick enough to give you a headache.  It seemed some scenes were just over too quickly & others just lingered. <br /> <br />I'm a devoted fan to the series & can only give this movie 3 stars for it's lack of what made POA such a wonderful book. <br /> <br />Honestly if this is what we're to expect from the Goblet of Fire when it comes out, then we can all plan to have the book in theaters to reference what exactly is going on in the movie.
B00005JMAH|4.0|I loved the movie but I think I would have enjoyed it more if I had not read the book again before going.  The director is certainly a more \\"artsy\\" director than the previous director (Chris Columbus) and his liberal thinking is evident in the making of this film. The scenery is beautiful and the art director did a wonderful job of creating the majestic Hogwarts that is described in the books. Because it differs from the other movies, many reviewers seem to forget the Hogwarts from the books. There are many cases of dramatic license in the film but I think it gives more visual interest to the story. PoA is my favorite book and this is my favorite movie so far, but when viewing this movie, treat them as two very different works of art.
B000002GFC|5.0|Here  it is, Bodge Phase ONE!!! This is A PSychodellic band, so it might sound strange and not as modern to your ears, like CCR!  It has all the hits WHite Room adn Tales of Brabe Ulysses, Ulysses, in case you didnt know, was a book by James Joyce, and not many people have read it, but it is The best one written.  SO get this it should be called THE ROOTS OF BODGE!<br /><br />Oh, this weekend I visited some old friends and we played a new game called the Bodge Game.  heres how.  You start by saying \\"Bodge Is\\" then a word with be the next person says \\"Bodge IS\\" and a word with O and so on.  Well when it came around for my one friend to say Bodge is B--- he said \\"Bodge is Beautiful\\".  Then there was a pause and my other friend called him a name that means bilingual but isnt so nice.<br /><br />So Now you can play the bodge game and this will happen and when it does it is pretty funny!!<br /><br />So now you know...

B000001F5F|5.0|Actually, the dividing point for U2 fans falls on the release of Joshua Tree--the point at which the New Wave/punk/indie band from Ireland sold out.  More precisely, the hard core U2 fans whose social consciousness was raised by anti-war anthems (Sudnay Bloody Sunday, Pride, etc.) were turned off by the sharp turn into a greasy love ballad smothered in Country-Western sauce. <br /> <br />However, it would be a correct statement to say that \\"Under a Blood Red Sky\\" is the centerpiece of those pre-sell out days.  The frenetic energy that Bono imbues in those earlier live performances (contrasted to MacPhisto in Zooropa) radiates from each cut.  Even the Old-Testament inspired \\"40\\" reveals the influence that U2 had on a live crowd as the album fades out on their echo of the chorus. <br /> <br />This album is as requisite to any record collection as John Lennon's \\"Live in New York City\\".  And don't forget that when CDs first hit the market, you couldn't walk into a music store that wasn't playing U2's \\"Boy\\".
B00006950W|5.0|I loved this movie.  I watched it on tv just a few nights ago and I am definitely going to go to Resident Evil: Apocalyspe.  I loved the ending to the first one.

B00007L4MJ|5.0|For some strange reason Amazon is putting up reviews for the 2003 Kino release version of Metropolis and using them in the revamped 2010 version!? Go figure.My review for the 2003 release is below.This one is for the 2010 release Kino version of the so called \\"complete\\" Metropolis.Well let us set the record straight right off the top by saying the 2010 release is NOT complete.It is between 6-9 minutes short of the original theatrical release,but it is the most complete as of now.An extra 25 or so minutes was found in an archive in Buenos Aires,but in a reduced frame of 16mm.It was in a terribly scratched condition and the archivists in Germany did their utmost to reduce the effects.With that extra footage added in,while it is not complete,it is,to date,the most complete and the movies plot now makes sense for the first time since its release back in the 20s.Like the 2003 Kino edition,this new 2010 edition is a marvel of restoration.It also boasts two discs.The second disc contains a documentary on the making of the film and its restoration,along with an interview with the curator of the museum in Buenos Aires where the footage was discovered.So for those that think that this 2010 release is just a re-release of the 2003 edition it is not.This is the definitive version right now and I highly recommend this new title for purchase.It is outstanding for its historic value and the restoration work accomplished on it.Kudos to all who were involved.<br /><br />All major studios the world over take note!! This is THE film by which all your restoration and release work should be measured by.<br />As a movie this version,the most complete ever released,is one of the masterpieces of the cinema in any age.<br />As an end product of extensive and exhaustive restoration work,this is the new benchmark by which all studios should be releasing their products whether old or new!!<br />I won't bore the reader with details of the exact process by which this was done(the accompanying liner notes in this DVD are quite clear on the subject),but I will say I have never seen a movie that was originally in this terrible of a condition literally reborn through the efforts of two archival groups in Munich and Wiesbaden,Germany.<br />Fritz Lang,the former art student turned scenarist turned director had  become one of Germanys' Universum Film Aktien Gesellschafts'(UFA for short) brightest talents.<br />Lang who co wrote the story for Metropolis with his wife,always preferred his movies/sets on the grand scale and this one was no exception.When released world wide in 1927 it caused quite the sensation and Lang was courted by every major studio around the globe for his services.<br />Langs's story works on many levels from labour versus management,mechanization versus humanity,good versus evil,etc.But Lang's grand vision and scale brilliantly binds everything together,while his attention to small details and deft touches reinforces the tale.A prime example of this would be Langs' staging of the changing of the workers' shift.The workers leave their stations in precise rows and groups,walking in step,heads bent forward.They enter an elevator.They exit the elevator again in tandem,heads still down.This \\"choreography\\" reinforces wonderfully our empathy for these downtrodden and depleted people/slaves.The workers who enter the elevator to replace their spent brethren also walk in tandem but their heads are held upright.But you know that come the end of their shift it will be they who will walk with heads down once more, bent over with the pain of exhaustion and continuing the never ending cycle of hopelessness and despair.<br />Powerful scenes with much to say and Lang did it masterfully.<br />This movie deserves each star(and more!) I've given it.<br />Kudos to Transit Films in Germany for its phenomenal work in the restoration of this \\"silent\\" masterpiece and to Kino in the U.S. for obtaining the rights to release this on DVD here in North America.<br />One of the best releases of any type,in ANY genre released on DVD to date!!<br />Get it.f the best releases of any type,in ANY genre released on DVD to date!!<br />Get it.
0440237688|5.0|I am currently a college student, and this book has remained my favorite since I read it in fifth grade.  I am a reading fanatic but have yet to find a better, more captivating, relevent, or touching story.  Lowry has an immense ability to add subtle political commentary while handling situations with tact and delicacy.  The character depth is amazing.  I can't even recommend this book highly enough.  I've forced all of my friends to read it, and they thank me countless times over.  I showed it to my mom who now uses it as part of her fifth grade curriculum.  It is the only book that every single one of her students enjoys.  None of them want to stop reading.  Still, my friends find the story engrossing-- it is highly developed and touching.  Do yourself a favor and read this book, you won't forget it.
B000286S8S|3.0|VH's almost-legendary status is poorly served by this de facto ad for the group's upcoming Sammy Hagar-led tour.  The first page of David Wild's uncharacteristically shallow liner notes alone twice refers to the band's new tour and/or the idea of buying concert tix.  The two new photos of the band feature Sammy, with David Lee Roth visible only in microscopic repros of original LP covers \\"Van Halen\\" and \\"Women and Children First.\\"  (THAT must have pissed Diamond Dave off but good.)  The music is not the problem:  every chart hit plus key album-rock radio staples Ain't Talkin' Bout Love, Jamie's Cryin', Poundcake, and Unchained (the one that goes, \\"one break, comin' up...\\") are here.  They sound great with two exceptions noted below.  <br /> <br />The pretext behind the packaging reveals the shuffling of the Roth and Hagar hits as no accident, just an attempt to minimize the biggest lineup change in rock history in favor of the current touring roster (Wild's \\"analysis\\":  \\"Exit Roth.  Enter Sammy Hagar.  What happened?  In any case...\\").  Fortunately the era-melding theme was not carried so far as to include stuff from the nightmarish VH3 era with that guy from Extreme.  The last step in the campaign to move concert tix worth several times the price of this CD set?  Include three Hagar-sung live versions of Dave-era classics to show that Sam can put over the whole VH songbook:  goodness, honey, he even sings \\"real\\" with two syllables just like David!  Now where DID I put that credit card?! <br /> <br />More than most groups, Van Halen has a story deserving major discussion in the booklet to its supposedly definitive collection.  Unfortunately this feels like a rush job that needs to replaced by something better in a year or two.  A shame. <br /> <br />P.S.:  Check your copy for the ending of \\"Finish What Ya Started;\\" on 3 copies I've listened to so far, it ends abruptly in mid-note.  Since it fades out on 45 and on \\"OU812,\\" it's probably a defect rather than a play onthe title.  And--just like on \\"Best of Vol. 1\\"--\\"Eruption\\" sounds unnatural leading into anything that's not \\"You Really Got Me,\\" as it did/does on \\"Van Halen\\" and on the radio.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I loved watching &quot;Firefly&quot; when it was on TV.  I didn't get to watch it regularly because of other evening commitments, but if I'd known they would air just 15 episodes before those gorram FOX execs axed the show, I would have taped those 15 religiously.  This DVD has given me a chance to right that wrong.  <br />All we can do at this point, my dear fellow fans, is show as much support for the &quot;Firefly&quot; franchise as we can.  BUY BUY BUY the DVD!  Buy one for yourself, one for your sister, one for your brother, one for your dog... And when the movie comes out (2005!!!), go see it as many times as you can, with as many people as you can!!!<br />The FOX network execs are obviously on some sort of mind-altering drug to cancel as show this awesome.  Hopefully with enough fan support, we can show them through their drug-induced stupor that they really need to bring it back.
B000069AUI|4.0|After the perfection of their debut, Parachutes, it would be difficult for Coldplay to make a sophomore CD that was anywhere near as good. <br /> <br />And in fact, this CD is not as good as their previous work, however, it's a testament to their quality as musicians that it still is an excellent venture for all involved.   Any other band would kill to have this be their best CD ever.   But Coldplay is so good, it's just their 2nd best. <br /> <br />The sensitivity of Chris Martin's vocals, the amazing creativity of sound and variety of style, makes this a more than worthy follow-up for a band that has proven they are not just a 1 CD wonder. <br /> <br />Standout tracks are the haunting \\"Clocks\\", the plaintive \\"In My Place\\" and the sweet \\"Green Eyes\\". <br />
B0002858YS|3.0|I picked up this cd not to long ago with hopes of wreckless abandonment and casino-inspired indie rock. What I got was exactly that! Hailing from the desert valley of Las Vegas, these guys rock, or do they? Let's investigate. <br /> <br />I was driving along the beach, fairly impressed with what I was listening to, until a song about the singer's love of indie rock came on. I wanted to take the cd and throw it to the dolphins, but I did pay for it. The song is totally obnoxious and confirmed on thing for me; the only good bands from Vegas are Faded Grey, Attaboy Skip, and Slaughter.
B00005MP58|5.0|There is a serious problem with the transfer of this excellent production to DVD.  Both the contrast and the color balance are very poorly rendered from the original video source.
0393035158|5.0|As a reader who already agreed with the premises of The End of Faith (in particular, that we need to outgrow religion or we will likely kill ourselves off), I was thrilled to see the ideas so perfectly articulated.  Now, instead of bumbling around in frustrating conversation with defenders of faith, I can simply hand them this book.  After reading the first few chapters, which are an historical catalogue of religion's horrors on this earth, any objective and thoughtful person would have to agree with the author that we must find other ways to examine the mysterious fact of existence.  And here, Harris uses insights from scientific and contemplative traditions based entirely on experimentation, not belief.  The few religious traditions, in particular, Buddhism, for which he seems to find some usefulness have to do with those traditions' experimentation with mind investigation through meditative techniques and the application of those techniques in contemporary society.  In this way, he distinguishes some religious traditions from others in pointing out that, from a psychological as well as a behaviorial stance, not all belief systems and religious practices lead to the same understanding or actions.  For instance, he asks, \\"Where are the Tibetan suicide bombers?\\"  The Tibetans have been under occupation and brutal rule since 1949.  Yet their Buddhist beliefs and practices enjoin them from killing anyone, and for the most part very little killling of Chinese has been done by Tibetans in the past half century.      Although Harris is willing to concede distinctions and the usefulness of some religious traditions, the book is an overall plea for an evolutionary step out of the Dark Ages of superstition and into the light of a humane rationality based on understanding our inevitable connectedness.  As Harris writes in the conclusion of The End of Faith, \\"No myths need be embraced for us to commune with the profundity of our circumstance.  No personal God need be worshipped for us to live in awe at the beauty and immensity of creation.  No tribal fictions need be rehearsed for us to realize, one fine day, that we do, in fact, love our neighbors, that our happiness is inextricable from their own, and that our interdependence demands that people everywhere be given the opportunity to flourish.\\"
B00005JMAH|3.0|I have read the novels in the HP series several times.  I consider myself Potterholic.  When I entered the theater to see the third movie, my hopes were high.  New director, new point of view. <br /> <br />I walked out extremely disappointed.  The flow of the movie seemed choppy at best.  The director seemed to spend too much time on certain aspects of the story and not enough on some very important parts of the story.  For example, he seemed to \\"throw\\" Professor Trelawny's vision in almost as an afterthought and did not explain it much.   <br /> <br />The back story for PoA was about Harry's father's boyhood friends.  Mr. Cuaron seemed to neglect that little aspect towards the end of the film when Harry encounters Pettigrew, Black, and Lupin in the Shreeking Shack.  It left the viewer disoriented and wondering why the sudden change in Lupin's opinion of Black. <br /> <br />The only positives about the film is it was darker and more spooky and the kids are growing as actors by leaps and bounds. <br /> <br />I do intend to purchase the film, but only because I don't like to have holes in a series. <br /> <br />View at your own risk, just don't read the book prior to it.  You will be disappointed.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|I had heard of but not heard Sarah Maclachlan before getting 'Afterglow' which I bought purely on the reviews I had read.  For me, an admitted country fan, this is a very pleasant change from the usual type of music I listen. The songs are rather Dido-like, but none the worse for that. The arrangements are extremely sophisticated and her voice is outstanding with a breathy, dreamlike quality and a beautiful lilt.  <br /> <br />I gather that other albums of hers have a different style but for me this is lovely soothing music, with a lyrical kick and it will spend a lot of time on my machine
B0000E1ALR|5.0|When someone has a career as long and consistently successful as Springsteen, choices for a greatest hits collection are not easy to make. It can be pretty painful for fans who notice their favorites are missing, and some make bad choices.  <br />     Generally, Springsteen did okay with his \\"Essential\\" collection. I can't give it anything under five stars because, frankly, it's some of the greatest music ever written. It is impossible for me to give four stars to a collection containing \\"Thunder Road,\\" \\"Born to Run,\\" \\"Rosalita,\\" \\"Badlands,\\" \\"Spirit in the Night,\\" \\"Streets of Philadelphia,\\" and dozens of other incredible songs. But I have a few complaints. It seems that the producers have a three-song-per-album limit for this collection, which is a terrible mistake. Really. Those early albums of Bruce's contain so many more than three great songs apiece - \\"Born to Run\\" is nothing but greatest hits-worthy material. I know choices had to be made, but I'm sorry; the following songs should have made this album. No question. <br />    \\"Growin' Up\\" <br />    \\"It's Hard to be a Saint in the City\\" <br />    \\"Incident on 57th Street\\" <br />    \\"Backstreets\\" (come on, Bruce, this is one of your top five of all time) <br />    \\"She's the One\\" <br />    \\"Adam Raised a Cain\\" <br />    \\"Racing in the Street\\" <br />    \\"Prove it All Night\\" <br />    \\"Independance Day\\" <br />    \\"Point Blank\\" <br />    \\"My Hometown\\" (come on! such an overlooked classic) <br />    \\"Better Days\\" <br />    \\"If I Should Fall Behind\\" <br />    \\"Empty Sky\\" <br />    \\"Nothing Man\\" <br />    \\"My City of Ruins\\" <br /> <br />    Whew. That's a lotta great songs that he passed on. I'm not saying the ones in here aren't amazing as well...I'm just saying he has too many great ones to leave it at 30. Also, the third CD isn't especially noteworthy. But hey...look at the songs on the first two CDs, and it's hard to argue with their greatness.
0679428895|5.0|Somewhere in Florence, perhaps in the Uffezi, stands a plaster of paris imprint of the mumified remains of a roman soldier, fleeing from the advancing lava of Vesuvius, trapped and immediately frozen in time by the sea of molten magma moving several hundred miles an hour. All for us to discover 2000 years later.<br /><br />What's interesting is the muscle tone of the back, the lats, the traps, the fingers outstretched, clawing, shocked. And of course the size . . . 'anatomically correct' an ad might read, 'but a foot and a half shorter.'<br /><br />I've always been struck by the similarity of those men and women, breasts, knuckles, toes, calves, really all the same as us.<br /><br />So that's where Harris takes us, and like Umberto Eco, we see one mystery atop another, atop another. And despite the excesses common to a barely regulated society, we meet the same kind of people, from the greedy and the cruel to the honest and the moral. The brave and the cowardly, the curious and the self absorbed.<br /><br />I found nothing to flaw this book. Writing historical novels is to take on an extra burden in the dialogue: What would the characters have said to eachother? So when the Aquarian Attilus confronts his feelings for the 18 year old Corrilia, there just aren't any self help books written on papyrus to give him any advice. Insight. Suggestions.<br /><br />Like David Robbins, and the aforementioned Eco, and Ken Follet writing his masterpiece of the building of the Cathedrals in Europe in the 9th c, Harris does a wonderful job in bringing us back to the time just following Nero, four days before the most well known volcano eruption before Mount St. Helens. Good job. Worth the read. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury
B000089RVX|2.0|I don't think Evanescence knew how big they'd become when they released Bring Me To Life but now they're everywhere. Unfortunately (though not so financially unfortunate for them) when an artist becomes big in either the US or UK, they are instantly hated by a swarm of people because they have a large fanbase which consists of a wide range of people. I personally think that's pathetic and it is not the reason why I've rated the album low. <br />Anyway, I bought the album (as most people did) after hearing Bring Me To Life for the upteenth time on the radio and I was quite disappointed. Apart from My Immortal and Hello, all the songs on Fallen sounded exactly the same. After paying more attention to the album I started to notice the difference between songs and gradually got to like them. However, by around October time I invested in Comalies by Lacuna Coil and instantly I forgot about Evanescence altogether. Then a few weeks ago I found the CD and decided just out of curiosity to listen to it again. It was disappointing. If you're after an album that has no emotion or depth to it, Fallen is perfect. In all honesty it makes a pretty good pop album but that's it. To label it under Gothic rock is absurd and completely unfair to all the true artists who work hard to be in that genre. The songs on Fallen are well produced and polished to perfection but they're dull and uninspiring. The lyrics are clichd and mind numbing and Amy Lee's vocals get tiresome after a while. I think the main problem with Fallen is that there's no originality at all- Evanescence themselves are no more than a poor man's version of Linkin Park with a female pop singer thrown in. Out of the 11 songs on the album, I only ever listen to My Immortal now. The fact that this song, a ballad, is the only thing worth listening to on a supposed rock album clearly signals that Ms Lee is singing in the wrong genre. Admit to being a pop singer and you never know, you might become the next Celine Dion..you'reannoying enough..
B00008O31H|5.0|If you've lost faith in the music industry, then I suggest you buy this album.  Although do not expect it to restore your faith in the music industry.  On this album, you will find two musicians writing and playing music for one reason only.  It has nothing to do with girls, fame, money, image or any of that crap.  They play music because they love it.   <br /> <br />This album will sound raw and unproduced compared to what's new and what is already out there.  It needs to sound that way otherwise it would lose so much.  The Black Keys play a raw, blues-rock, aggressive type music.  And you know what?  It comes off beautifully.  It has been a long time since I heard an album where it was evident the band loved music and it showed.  It starts off with an aggressive bang with thickfreakness and ends with a softer, melodic bluesy note with i cry alone.  In between, is straight up rocking music with a blues tinge.  I for one am not a fan of blues, but I love this album.  Do yourself a favor, buy this album.
B00024BHTC|4.0|Nightwish made one of the best female fronted rock albums of all time with Ocenborn back in 1998 and have continued to provide us with great music ever since. Their most recent effort, Once, isn't quite on par with their other records but it's still much better than most of the rubbish around. Tarja's vocals have changed quite significantly recently and they are now slightly less operatic. Whether this change was done on purpose or not goes without seeing but it doesn't really affect the quality of the music. Unfortunately where Tarja's vocals excel, the male vocals on Once are terrible. Luckily, Tarja does the vast majority of the singing so we don't have to hear the joke-like vocals very often. <br />The songs on Once are in general much heavier than on other Nightwish albums which could be seen as either a good or bad thing. To be honest, I've only had this album for a week and am still finding it hard to distinguish between individual songs  but I guess that happens with most albums at first. The song \\"Nemo\\" does not follow this rule though and has been a massive hit across the whole of Europe. Infact, Nightwish have become one of Europe's favourite bands yet in the UK they go by virtually unrecognized. I think this is mainly because their style of music is uncommon in the UK and would be seen as a little over the top. Anyway, my opinion on Once is that it's an album worth buying if you liked any other Nightwish albums or you are fond of heavy, melodramatic metal.  <br />Best songs= Nemo, Ghost Love Score <br />Worst song= Dark Chest of Wonders
0764113496|5.0|This is an indispensable guide to the conjugations of Russian verbs. While Russian isn't as difficult as it seems to the outsider the grammar is certainly difficult if only because of the number of conjugations and the number of exceptions to each rule. It's enough to frustrate a beginner. This book goes quite a long way towards helping guide you through the maze of verbal conjugations.<br /><br />If you're studying Russian grammer or are seriously interested in the language you should not be without this. Along with other reviewers here I'd agree, this is a lifesaver.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|One thing about George Romero, he's not shy about milking his creations for all their worth.  God knows how many editions of Night of the Living Dead there are available in various collections or editions.<br /><br />First, lets just call it as it is.  Dawn of the Dead..the original is the greatest Zombie movie ever and one of the scariest movies ever.  Picking up after NOTLD, by now the Zombies have run rampant and people are fleeing wherever they can.<br /><br />A small group of four including two SWAT team members a TV reporter, and her helicopter pilot boyfriend flee the city, finally setting down on the roof of a large, suburban shopping mall.<br /><br />The soon realize that the mall has everything they need to sustain them including shelter, food, water, even a bank loaded with cash just in case man survives.  But first, they must clean the mall of hundreds of zombies who roam the halls because the mall was an important place in their life.<br /><br />The four go on a hunt and destroy mission to first seal the doors to the mall and block them with large semi-trucks.  Then they kill off all the zombies in the mall and our living a life of relative ease when a rogue group of bikers led by make-up guru Tom Savini comes storming into the mall to loot it.<br /><br />With the mall now filled with zombies again the four have to fight off the zombies and bikers.<br /><br />Savini is at the top of his game giving us incredible and incredibly gory effects like the face exploding from the shotgun, the top of a zombie head being sheared off by a chopper blade, and various scenes of entrails being torn out from still living victims and eaten by the zombies.<br /><br />To some extent, now 25 years later or so the effect look a bit dated.  The blood in parts looks more like red paint but still this is one great movie and the one which all other zombie movies must compare to.<br /><br />It is far better than the recent remake and superior to the sequel \\"Day of the Dead\\".  Again, while we have no big name actors, those we do do a comendable job and do not seem as amateurish as in the Night or Day.<br /><br />The ultimate edition will have 3 cuts of the movie.  The theatrical release, the Directors cut and the European cut.  Each of these will have separate audio commentary tracks.<br /><br />The 4th disk is filled with extras including documentaries, interviews, stills, and more.

B00009ATIX|4.0|Be prepared to be patient while watching Solaris. Based on the novel by Stanislaw Lem it's influenced heavily by the atmospheric Russian version directed by the great Andrei Tarkovsky [one of the great directors of Russian cinema], Solaris is by Hollywood standards very introspective and slowly paced.<br /><br />The basic storyline is that a space station has basically stopped functioning and its crew has gone mad.  A psychologist [`Chris Kelvin played by George Clooney] requested by the crew's commander is sent out to the remote planet to investigate the matter.  At this point many readers may be thinking `Aliens' or something along similar lines, but thankfully this isn't so. The `monster' if there is one, is one's own psyche from where the Planet Solaris [whose vast ocean is a life form of sorts- not really delved into in this version] creates real life copies.<br /><br />What Kelvin discovers is a ship who's crew has been driven to insanity by the real life constructions of people from their past.  What if a loved one, now long dead, re-appeared in the flesh in your own life?  For some in the crew this is just far too much to bear.  Kelvin himself succumbs as his wife [or a `copy' of her], who committed suicide years before, appears in real life form dazed and confused by what's happened.  His reaction to her, his fear and guilt, are the heart of the film.<br /><br />While the novel and the Russian film are more philosophical, Director Steven Soderberg's Solaris is more a love story with philosophical connotations.  Guilt, regret, confusion and fear play havoc with Kelvin and the crew.  In the end the psychologist succumbs to his psyche while the crew's physicist shed's any link with her own constructs.<br /><br />Solaris doesn't quite rise to the level of artistry as Tarkovsky's version and it eschews  most the scientific and philosophical aspects of Lem's novel [and unfortunately an interesting sub-plot on the history of the discovery of Solaris].  Judged on its own terms and relative to what's being released by Hollywood today, Solaris is a very adult film that delves into the human psyche quite well.  On those terms I think it's a success..

B00005JN2X|5.0|This thriller was a wicked ride of suspense, action and everything else! Vincent is a hired hitman who is killing all 4 of this womans suspects in her case. Then, he goes after her. The acting was awesome and Tom Cruise was an awesome badguy. From start to finish it was awesome, especially the heart-pounding ending!
0790729725|5.0|Martin Scorsese's 1990 epic mob film on the real life Henry Hill (Ray Liotta.)  Probably one of the greatest mob films along with Coppola's 'Godfather' films bringing all the action and drama of life with the Italian mob.    The film follows the life of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) and his associates played by Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci.  Joe Pesci gives probably one of the most memorable performances in his career and the film as the sociopathic Tommy DeVito: \\"You think I'm funny?\\"    I can't find a single defect in this gripping film. Every aspect of the film was done with the traditional brilliance of Martin Scorsese.  Great script, direction, and acting make this film one which you can watch over and over without ever getting tired.  Definitely a film that should be in every wiseguy's collection.
B000002N2Z|5.0|When I first heard this album I thought there might be hope for the metal genre after all.  I was wrong, but lets not talk about that.  This album was short but not too short.  Full of energy.  Nobody had screamed/singed so well since Nirvana.  It had almost a hardcore/punk feel to it due to the lack of solo's and no double bass.  I  enjoyed every song on the album and could even tolerate the rappy ones.  If only they wouldn't have ended up sucking so hard.  It was like rapid pace metallica syndrome being that it only took the D-tones 4 albums to rise and fall.  Kinda funny actually.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|Brian De Palma's 1983 film on the life of Tony Montana (Al Pacino); a violent sociopath who was shipped by Fidel Castro with thousands of other Cuban criminals as a political undesirable/refugee.  One of five good films De Palma ever made out of 20 or more really bad ones(The Untouchables; Carrie; Carlito's Way; and Mission Impossible are the others.)     The film's plot is pretty simple in that it follows the rise and fall of the central character: his family relationships and his dealings with society as well as other crime syndicates.  Although the film has every trapping of a cheesy 1980s film as with every other De Palma film, Al Pacino's brilliant performance along with the talents of the supporting actors (Michelle Pfeiffer, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, and Robert Loggia) make this film a classic.    This is another great mob film that should be in everyone's collection without exception: don't be without it!
B000005ZGZ|5.0|Fugazi's End Hits is truly one of the best albums of all time, only to be trumped by another Fugazi album if you're already a fan. With Fugazi it's really listeners choice, in my opinion every album is a classic. To a new comer this album will grow on you like a weed. A beautiful, hard hitting, guitar smashing, bass pumping, lyrically ambigous weed. Cause that's End Hits. <br /> <br />Hits: Break, Five Corporations, Coustic Acrostic, oh who am i kidding the whole thing rocks.
B0002TT0NW|5.0|I absolutely adored this movie. It was perfect! The action the emotions, all seemed so magically real. The actors seemed less of cardboard cutouts, and felt like they actually had personalities. This was the favorite of the Harry Potter movies, and I can't wait till the release of the DVD so that I can see it as many times as I want.
B0000028UK|4.0|Despite blowing into the mainstream stratosphere about fourteen years ago, it was just now recently that I obtained my first PEARL JAM record, PJ's sophomore effort entitled \\"Vs.\\", which follows the outrageous success of their grand debut, \\"Ten\\", which I have purchased via this favorable site.  My only real encounter with PJ in the past have been with those classic songs from \\"Ten\\", like `Black', `Jeremy', and `Alive'.  In all honesty, I was only about 3 years old when \\"Ten\\" was released,  so I just now began discovering the grunge movement and all of it's glorious all-stars, i.e. NIRVANA, STONE TEMPLE PILOTS, SOUNDGARDEN and such and so.  I loved those PJ singles and thought I'd pick up an album, namely \\"Ten\\".  Turns out \\"Vs.\\" was the only one WalMart had (yes, I get ALL my cds at WalMart), so that's the one I ended up shelling out my cash for.  And, as I'm sure you've read before, it definitely was NOT what I was expecting.<br /><br />The only track i'd heard on the album previous to my purchase was `Dissident', so I'll start there.  `Dissident', my friends, completely ROCKS, and is easily my favorite song on the album.  The beautiful, wailing guitar intro completely sets the tone for the song, with Eddie Vedder displaying his gorgeous baritone vocals in raspy, emotionally-charged melodies that build upon the music superbly.  It's just a gorgeous song, strongly in the vein `Alive' and/or `Jeremy', and was EXACTLY the type of thing I was expecting from the entire record.  And as I said before, I didn't get that.<br /><br />First off, I was not expecting `hard rock' songs from this band, songs like the pure adrenaline of `Go' and `Animal', or the scathing harshness of `Leash' and `Blood'.  `Rearviewmirror' more closely follows my original vision of all that is PEARL JAM, it being the melodic, emotional masterpiece that it is, as well as the gorgeous, partly acoustic `Daughter', and the all-acoustic `Old Woman Behind the Counter in a Small Town', which has an amazing splendor entirely of it's own.<br /><br />All of those songs, barring `Leash' and including the quiet, but PERFECT `Indifference', are the real meat of the album, and while they are(for the most part) nothing quite like I expected(think `Jeremy'/`Dissident'), their obvious absolute magnificence have won me over all too easily.  Even though I started out a little bit disappointed with the album, I soon learned to adore it for what it WAS, rather than what I had INTENDED it to be.<br /><br />The only songs I find difficult to get into are `Leash', which I mostly feel is downright ridiculous, `W.M.A.', which is just WEIRD, and, sometimes, `Glorified G', a song that, for all intents and purposes, simply falls flat without becoming the inspiring work that it should . . . but again, this is only sometimes.  So, my first experience with the Jam is a good one, and, I hope, shall continue to be so.  4 stars, BABY!!!zing splendor entirely of it's own.   <br /> <br />All of those songs, barring `Leash' and including the quiet, but PERFECT `Indifference', are the real meat of the album, and while they are(for the most part) nothing quite like I expected(think `Jeremy'/`Dissident'), their obvious absolute magnificence have won me over all too easily.

B00005JNEI|5.0|Whether you believe the material or not, this film is brilliant. The rare clips and well chosen music are put together in a very entertaining mosaic.  This movie is unique in that it moves people in different ways. Some cheer others cry and the rest are outraged.   <br /> <br />This is the left's antidote to FOX.     <br />
B000000ZKD|3.0|This is an oddball, clearly a product of the times, and constantly walking the fine line between totally inspired and totally elevator. Their rendition of \\"Something\\" approaches a level of George Bensonish inpiration. The large instrumental suite near the end of the album (track 4) sometimes catches fire, but often, you get the impression that BT&MGs are only doing this because they're (1) short on material or (2) because they can. The latter is reason, in and of itself, to check it out.
B0002IU988|5.0|This CD is solid. Certainly one of the best rock releases that has come out in a LONG time. I can't stop playing it over an over again... yes, there is a 'feel' of Creed to it, but hey, it's Mark Tremonti writing all of the music and most of the lyrics... and what is wrong with that~ he is one of the best guitarists around with incredible melodies, bridges, and riffs.  Myles Kennedy adds a new twist to the sound, with his wide vocal range, and a new dimension to the lyrics with his writing contributions. And you can't forget the ripping drum-lines from Scott Phillips and the familiar bass from the 1st Creed bassist Brian Marshall.<br /><br />If you like rock with singing guitars, melodies, and vocals with a wide range, this is a must.  The title song (track 2) is tremendous as well as track 3 (their first release being played on the radio, VH1, and MTV)... track 8 is also a real winner. The lyrics are insightful, moving, and hopeful. I can see many of these songs played on the radio in the near future.<br /><br />I think these guys have hit a home-run!
B00028HBKM|5.0|Probably one of the most controversial films of 2004, but one of the best movies i have seen in my life (along with \\"The Matrix\\"). Mel Gibson has made a masterpiece by far.
B00007E8V4|5.0|It's hard to believe this album was comprised of B-Sides, because it's full of meaty tracks.  My favorite of SOAD's albums, though Toxicity and their self-titled offering are both great in their own right. <br /> <br />I can't listen to \\"Mr. Jack\\" without getting angry.  I like that. <br /> <br />Oh, and another thing that's made me angry- reading consumer reviews of this album that say something to the effect of \\"SOAD was great, their first album was innovative and awesome, and Toxicity was great, but then it started getting play, and now they suck\\" <br /> <br />Does this sound ridiculous to anyone else, or is it just me?  An artist's work stands as what it is, regardless who listens to it or how often.  Someone else discovered your music.  Get over yourself.  Continue to appreciate the music it for what it is.
B00005JN2X|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Jamie Foxx, Tom Cruise, and Jada Pinkett-Smith all give top-notch performances.  All of them are highly likeable characters, even Cruise who plays a hitman who appears unfeeling to his \\"victims,\\" while being \\"caring\\" to others, especially Foxx.  What I liked about this is that it is different from most thrillers.  It doesn't use the same tired tricks that other thrillers seem to use.  (when someone appears dead, he is dead).   <br /> <br />The movie never gets boring from beginning to end.  This movie looks like a springboard for more roles for Foxx and Pinkett-Smith!

B00005JMEW|3.0|Despite being a fan of Tarantino's films, and despite most of the glowing reviews here of the movie, I have to give this one the thumbs down (although I give it three stars for effort, and I say a few good things about Tarantino at the end of the review).<br /><br />It's not because I'm some sort of Japanese sword purist (who can be pretty stuffy and persnickety when it comes to how their arts are portrayed), but there was one thing that bugged me (possibly only because I know just enough about the Japanese Samurai sword arts to be dangerous) which is that the actors in this film didn't even know how to correctly hold the sword.<br /><br />You don't hold it with your elbows out and especially with them tense; you hold it with your elbows down. The elbows-out thing is for teenage-mutant ninja turtle wannnabees who have more hormones than common sense or real technique. Also, the sword is not a power art like karate where a lot of strength and power is needed--in the sword arts you're supposed to be more relaxed and fluid since you're swinging a three-foot razor blade and as the phrase goes, \\"You're supposed to let the sword do the work.\\" In that sense they're more Tai Chi-like than karate-like. The actors and actresses here were way too tense and rigid in the way they handled the sword.<br /><br />The other thing is that even completely severed limbs don't spray blood in amounts equivalent to the huge fountains at the palace of Versailles. I realize Tarantino is probably poking fun at the genre with this over-the-top special effect, but still, a little goes a long way here.<br /><br />And finally, although I realize this is Tarantino's tribute to the chop-socky movie genre, there's no way even the greatest swordsman in the world could win against 100 other (properly trained, that is) swordsman at the same time.<br /><br />Despite the above qualms, I give it three stars for effort and I do appreciate Tarantino's fine camera technique and his ability to set up tense personal situations and great action scenes, and he does know how to make a good movie when he sticks to what he does best.t up tense personal situations and great action scenes, and he does know how to make a good movie when he sticks to what he does best. <br /> <br />
B00005JMUA|5.0|Kill Bill Volume 2 has less action and less blood squirting but has a stronger story, drama and more dialogue than Volume 1. In Volume 2, Uma Thurman is still on her hunt for Bill (David Carradine). First though she needs to take out his brother Budd (Michaal  Madsen) and the one eyed Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah).<br /><br />  It's slower with too much dialogue some might think but the dialogue is still always entertaining. Especially the lines delivered by David Carradine and Michael Madeson. Carradine does his best work I think and makes you wonder why he's not in more movies. He definetly gives one of the best supporting performances this year so far. Although Uma wasn't nominated for the first Vol she should be for this one as well. She does some of her best work here as well. The only problem I had is a small one. The fight with the Bride and Bill at the end is way too short and their dialogue lasts longer. Still surprisingly it's not anti-climatic and reminds me sort of the way a Westen show-down would end. Quentin Tarantino shows in this half that he wasn't out to just make kun-fu blood bath. This second half is where all the drama and stronger story can be found.
B000059PPN|1.0|I purchased this film for 5.99 from my local HMV, the other day and have just finished sitting through this so-called film. <br /> <br />There was no story line, just a poorly conceived concept the dubbing or voice sinc was atrocious. The actors especially the young boy was extremely annoying and the gore that normally would make a film like this, remotely watch able was non-existent. <br /> <br />Characters just turned up with no explanation, people disappeared and no one seemed bothered, blood seem to just vanish from the floor, need I go on..... <br /> <br />Anyway save yourself some time, stare at the wall for 82 minutes you will feel more satisfied! <br />
0790729636|3.0|I always liked Twister but mosty because of the fun special effects. The characters themselves are annoying and you actually wish they'll die because who in the hell is dumb enough to chase a tornadoe anyway ? lol. Bill Paxton plays a guy who can sense when a tornadoe is coming and when it's gonna strike when I heard that's not possible. Helen Hunt plays a nutball who's obsessed with chasing a tornadoe because one killed her father when she was little. Paxton and Hunt try hard but their roles are dumb as is the script. Also annoying in supporting roles are Philip Seymour Hoffman \\"who's a much better actor now and Jamie Gertz (Lost Boys) as Paxton's g/f. The Tornadoe itself is what makes the movie worth watching. The scenes with flying cows, tractors and gasoline trucks help make the movie more fun. The movie would've been better if was about just normal people trying to survive through a tornadoe that's hitting their town.
B0000D96NW|5.0|I saw MH in Den Bosch (the Netherlands)on the MetalBash festival 2003,and what can I say... <br />Pure metal, pure emotion. <br />The music in this album is purely fantastic and most mentionable are the lyrics. Robb Flynn is a great writer and every time I listen to TTAOE i pick up the booklet and read from song 1 to the last song. The Lyrics on this album are very important. It shows that Robb is a real man with feelings. <br />If you listen to all the other MH albums, it shows that this band is very progressive (sometimes they remember me of Rush). <br />Thank you Machine Head.
B000001GRZ|1.0|This is a completly messed version of the suites.  I absolutely hate it.  The playing is so stiff, it's hard to listen to.  The quality is terrible, and I have never listened to this kind of recording of the suites before.  There are notes that are wrong, and the playing does not sound professional at all.  I recommend that you buy Rostropovich's suites, Yo-Yo-Ma's, or Cascal's.  Those are much better than this recording.
B00005ATQG|5.0|I will never get bored of this movie. I can watch it over and over and still love every minute of it. Of course it's not all like the book...but really, like someone else said: why should it be? It shouldnt!  <br />James Mason does a marvelous job. I love his voice (also narrating the Tale Tell Heart, cartoon verison). Sue Lyon does great, as does Winters. <br />The music in the film is so catchy! I love Lolita Ya Ya. It will be stuck in my head forever!
B000001FYL|5.0|I liked the albume so much that I just had to see young guns and young guns II even though i don't really like western movies. After i saw the movies i enjoyed the songs even more because they made more sense. it's a pretty emotional and depressing album. it's more acoustic rather than electric as seen in the previous albums. blaze of glory, santa fe, miracle, dy'n ain't much of a livin', blood money are very powerful songs
0312263120|3.0|This isn't one of my favorites, but I can see Dan Brown's potential that led to The Davini Code. Character development could have been a lot better and at times the story is rather fragmented. All in all I think it's a decent book, but not one of my top twenty for the past few years.
B000002ADT|5.0|Well, it is a must and not just for a jazz listener but for every human being appreciates pure, simple and wonderful music. Miles had a unique skill to transform his art into something everyone could identify with. Miles tried to transcend the simple blues pattern. He succeeded. Yet, he remains on Earth, immanent in every note, his entire being fixed on one cause. I am not sure what made this album the jazz album of all time, as many like to say, but it is one of a kind. Although Miles had always possessed this lyrical palate in his horn, the combination of those players makes it a highlight that not often a musician experience. Certainly, it is a more rare moment in recording jazz album. All must be in perfect shape.  Now listen to the quiet opening of So What. It catches you right from the start. The simple chorus line holds you attentive and you can feel the note progress like a heartbeat. Loud and clear blues walk with some wonderful moments of interaction between Coltrane and Miles. The rhythm section is strong and attentive, again, in an unusual way - listen to some of Evans chords.  \\"All Blues\\" and \\"Freddie Freeloader\\" are Tour de Force of each and every one of the players. One cannot describe the hours of pleasure this little album gave me along the years. To the serious jazz listener/musician a word of advice: It is recommended to have the Coltrane-Miles full set along side the original in order to study the development of this one of a kind group recording and perhaps understand Miles thinking process.
B000002UVX|5.0|If I had to put this album into one word it would be amazing. This is one of the greatest things I have ever heard in my life! Its so groovy and funky that you cant help but tap your foot while listening to every song, and of course this album would be worth getting just because its a Jimi Hendrix album and anything he ever did was complete genius and sadly we will probaly never hear anything so original and as great or even close to as good as this. Every track is outstanding and I even enjoyed it when Buddy Miles took over on vocals even tho I cant say he has as great of voice as Jimi but its still good.If your a new hendrix fan and your looking for a place to start out I would definetly recommend buying this along with Electric Ladyland which is also a truly amazing album to get you started. I just cant say enough how great this proformace is. Its definetly thee greatest live album ive ever heard in my entire life along with the Allman Brothers Filmore concert which I would also recommend picking up. Now quit reading this review and go out and buy Band of Gypsys!!
B00005JNEI|5.0|It pains me to see people too tired from their own fights against the truth. I see all of these reviews saying it is anti-american propaganda... qnd that we should read the 9/11 commission. Believe it or not the government still lies. This film tells it how it is. This film genuinely can change your mind and open your eyes, and if you still beleive that George Bush is saving america through christianity and saving Iraq through changing them to the demoicratic system, you are horribly wrong... Open your mind. The system doesn't work and this is going to be the collapse.
B0002IU988|5.0|Great cd!  I really enjoyed the melodies. Yes...melodies.  Something that is sorely lacking in todays music.  The singer has a tremendous vocal range.  Stop with the Creed comparisons already! It is what it is.....quality hard rock.  I'd sure as hell rather listen to this than the prevelant hip hop crap that has dominated the music scene over the past decade.
B00005JKC3|1.0|Whenever the subject comes up all you read (or hear) is how bad this movie is and how disappointing it was. However, I never heard of many reasons as to why it's so bad. Well after viewing it for myself I realize that yes it's bad. I'll tell you what I think is bad about it. After a painfully boring first 40 minutes which explains how science can go wrong (been there, done that) you come to realize that now that the HULK is finally present the action isn't. Well at least it's boring and unexciting action. The CGI of the HULK is unique, but I'm not sure that's a good thing. I'd rather have a real live actor play the key title role in a live action comic book movie. Bad script w/ bad dialogue and I hate how director Ang Lee had 2 to 4 squares on the screen at one time. Even on a big screen t.v. it wasn't possible to follow. If you still plan to buy this DVD, buy those Hulk hands with it so after you watch it, you can Hulk smash it.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Superunknown was one of the best albums in the 90's for me. I never got into rage against machine. Now that you know where I stand, this album is absolutely wicked. From start to finish. Yeah there are some songs better than others but at least half of them are blisteringly superb. Get it if you're a fan of rock. Chris Cornell reigns supreme.
B000007ODL|5.0|This album is one of the best representations of Cale's work. Growing up in Cale's hometown, Tulsa Oklahoma, I have been enchanted by his music since a young child. I have had the blessed privilege to play on stage with J.J. and his recordings have captured the same \\"at home on the porch\\" sound as his live performances. The songs he writes are so  much like his true life personality, earthy and warm, that it is virtually impossible to not like his work. This is definitely one to have for your collection if you love original \\"Tulsa Sound\\" material.
B000002JPA|5.0|Images & Words(1992). Dream Theater's Second Album, And the First To Feature Vocalist James Labrie.<br /><br />In 1992, when Grunge and Alternative Rock dominated the Charts and the airwaves, Progressive Metal, helped along by the releases 'Metallica' and Queensryche's 'Empire', was finally breaking through to a larger audience. Dream Theater is typically classified as Progressive Metal, yet they are so much more. They incorporate Jazz(\\"Another Day\\"), Reggae/African Influences(\\"Surrounded\\"), and at times, seem the furthest thing from Heavy Metal. To define Dream Theater, I would take Rush(of 'Moving Pictures' fame), except add in Zakk Wylde on guitar(of Ozzy Osbourne fame). John Pettruci, Dream Theater's Lead Guitarist, is not only capable of Heavy Metal riffs but also pulls of melodic chords with ease. Upon its release, 'Images & Words' entered the Top 40, eased along by the success of \\"Pull Me Under\\", which became an MTV Video hit, and over time, 'Images & Words' has received the most critical and commercial fame of any Dream Theater release. Each musician in Dream Theater, with the exception of vocalist Labrie, is a virtuoso musician, with Petrucci taking technical mastery of the guitar to new levels, Mike Portnoy rythmically defining every song, Kevin Moore blending an intrepid mixture of Keyboards and Piano, and James Myung shelling out some excellent bass work. So, is Dream Theater just a bunch of technical wizards with no substance, or a phenomenal band that's just below the public's eye? Read on to find out!<br /><br />Track Ratings-<br /><br />Pull Me Under- Arguably 'Images & Words' standout track, \\"Pull Me Under\\" is the album's darkest and heaviest track, from Petrucci's gloomy opening chords to Labrie's haunting vocals, \\"Pull Me Under\\" remains consistent throughout. Petrucci and Moore out-do themselves here, interweaving their instruments beautifully. A dark and thought-provoking Heavy Metal masterpiece!<br /><br />Another Day- Jazz you say? Why yes! \\"Another Day\\" is an optomistic, heart-warming ballad, featuring Moore playing a soulful keyboard melody and Labrie taking his melodic vocals to the next level. Listen for the Saxophone and guitar solos, as they are both equally brilliant and engaging!<br /><br />Take The Time- See the Rush influences yet? \\"Take The Time\\" starts as a typical Heavy Metal song, yet, much like Rush's \\"Roll The Bones\\", Dream Theater molds the song into a sarcastic look at today's culture. Portnoy's \\"bullet\\" drumming and Petrucci's ever-changing guitar(He can go from Dark and Heavy one moment to Light and Up-beat the next), not to mention Labrie's operatic vocals never cease to amaze me. Take the time to listen to \\"Take The Time\\"!<br /><br />Surrounded- Beginning as a ballad between Moore and Labrie, \\"Surrounded\\" veers suddenly into an upbeat and fun song that seems to adapt Reggae and African influences. Labrie's vocals clearly seem to sound like Geddy Lee's, and Petrucci much like Alex Lifeson(of Rush), uses a melodic, \\"synthesized\\" guitar melody. Moore is \\"Surrounded\\"'s backbone, carrying the symphonic keyboards and piano to define the song. Brilliant.<br /><br />Metropolis: The Miracle And The Sleeper(Part 1)- A prequel to Dream Theater's lengthy concept album 'Metropolis: Scenes From A Memory', the prequel is no less engaging. Petrucci's hypnotic and ambient guitar chords, which can be metallic one second and dizzyingly melodic the next fit in perfectly with Labrie, who can go from moody to upbeat in a split second. Simply beautiful and enthralling!<br /><br />Under A Glass Moon- Considerably gloomier than the past few songs, \\"Under A Glass Moon\\" finds Dream Theater playing in a melodic Progressive Metal epic, and from Labrie's pained vocals to Petrucci's wailing(not to mention shredding) guitar harmonies, you can't help but not listen. Portnoy's fever-pitch drumming also stands out of the crowd! Don't like this song? If so go get some taste!<br /><br />Wait For Sleep- 'Images & Words'shortest track, \\"Wait For Sleep\\" is in no way a filler track. Picture a melodic Tool song(\\"Parabola\\"?), but replace all the instruments with a keyboard and put Labrie instead of Maynard and you've got yourself a helluva song.<br /><br />Learning To Live- Epic and Mind-Numbingly masterful, \\"Learning To Live\\" is a mystifying track that rotates from a melodic, keyboard driven rocker to an instrumental piece la resistance, combining instrumentation that verges on the apex of technical mastery. A Progressive Metal epic that ends 'Images & Words' appropriately, as it leaves you speechless.<br /><br />Overall, 'Images & Words' is quite a listen, from the gloom and doom of \\"Pull Me Under\\" to the melodic Progressive epic of \\"Learning To Live\\", Dream Theater pushes the limitations of technical and musical boundaries. Dream Theater still allows a certain emotional and optomistic tone to the album, and unlike another reviewer said, they're not all flash with no substance....these guys have heart! Although I'm not sure if this is one of my absolute favorite records, 'Images & Words' is a Progressive Metal masterpiece, and along with Queensryche's 'Operation: Mindcrime' deserves to be in EVERYBODY'S collection.

0446672653|3.0|I read this book in one night so this book has some amazing things in it that make the heart beat. Its like an eternal longing to be with the One that connects with you. Isn't that what we look for, certain connection that electrifies your spirit and is more than the body or mind. When you look into someones eyes and you know you met them before. I was a Christian when I met my soulmate and in this faith reincarnation is not believed but I couldn't explain why I felt so joyous and happy, when I laughed around him and I couldn't look at his eyes because I knew that I would give away that I loved him and it seemed impossible to love without \\"knowing\\" him, but I felt like I knew him forever...I spent months fighting the illogic of it till I read this book. Now I know, I have known him before. Besides the very real confirmations of what I heard and knew from the spirit that was read in this book, I also noted come very similar repetitions in the book that could have been excluded and it could have contained more information about other soulmate relationships that he had witnessed. This love story was beautiful and it makes a person wonder about the nature of enternal love between people. How long have you loved the one you are with? I do suggest care in taking this information to practice and hope for ones in your life that may be temporary - it seems that some self-mastery is involved in finding the true one.
B0002858YS|4.0|I got Hot Fuss a couple days ago after only really hearing \\"Somebody Told Me\\" and then the 30-second clips on amazon.  The best way I can describe The Killers is a combination of The Strokes, The Cure, Depeche Mode, and Dead or Alive.  As someone below described it, it's danceable pop.  If anyone has seen American Psycho, this seems like music that should have been in the club scenes in that movie.  All in all, I like the CD because it harkens back to the '80s.  Other than \\"Somebody Told Me,\\" \\"Mr. Brightside\\" and \\"Midnight Show\\" are probably the best songs.  Other bands I listen to are The Beatles, The Who, and Black Sabbath.
B0002IU988|4.0|I must say that I was expecting this cd to not be very good. I thought the last creed cd wasnt all that great. I was very impressed at the musical talents of these people. Mark is an excellent guitarist. The licks and solos are amazing. Everyone who says that he isnt good, I have a question for you. If you are so good, why dont you have a hit song? With Brian back, the creative juices were flowing more than ever before. Kennedy is a good singer although I have to agree that he gets very annoying on some songs. Alter Bridge isnt just Creed. I believe someone said before, \\"This is what Creed should have been.\\" I think some of the songs sound a little like Creed material but its still good. If it wasnt for the singing i could give it a 5. I think you should go buy this cd. I think you will be suprised with the musical talent these guys bring to the table.
B00005JMEW|5.0|After a seven year wait between Tarantino films, I awaited \\"Volume 1\\" anxiously.  Now Tarantino's previous film, \\"Jackie Brown\\" was a work of progress for him.  It was more story oriented and had extremely good acting and character developement.  Some people would say that \\"Kill Bill\\" is a step back from the maturity Tarantino displayed with \\"Jackie Brown\\".  That said, one has to accept this film for what it is and see if it succeeds on it's own terms.  It does.  It's difficult to separate this film from \\"Volume 2\\" because if you asked me prior to seeing the second film how I would rate \\"Volume 1\\" I would have given it four stars.  I would have said that it was entertaining and well acted but it lacked charater developement and the story left you hanging.  However, now having seen \\"Volume 2\\", I would say it made perfect sense to cram the action in the first part and save character and plot for the second one.  As for the acting, Tarantino has cast this film perfectly.  Uma Thurman emerges as a compelling action star here but is a good enough actress to imbue sympathy for her character \\"Black Mamba\\".  Lucy Liu is her equal as the Chinese-Japanese-American warlord who used to be Thurman's ally with the DIVA hit squad.  I saw this film originally in a theatre and even though the violence is over-the-top I didn't find it that disturbing.  On home video, however, I found the violence much more jarring even though it is employed to a somewhat cartoonish effect.  Elements that also work here are the snappy editing and cinematography and of course Tarantino's unusually impecable choice of music and song that are scene appropriate.
B00008EY9G|5.0|YES. HEH, HEH, HEH. EXQUISITE. THIS IS TRULY A MASTER MOVIE OF SUSPENSE, THRILLS AND TWISTS. NOT TO MENTION THE EXCEPTIONAL ACTING FROM THE ENTIRE CAST. ITS RARE THAT A MOVIE DOES WHAT IDENTITY DOES, COMPLETLEY ENWRAPS THE AUDIENCE AND DOESNT LET THEM GO UNTIL THE VERY FINAL FRAME OF FILM. USING VERY CLEVER TACTICS AND TRAPPINGS TO TRICK THE AUDIENCE IN TO THINKING ONE THING AND THEN COMPLETLEY DELIVERING ANOTHER. THE REAL TREAT FOR THE AUDIENCE IS THAT THE PLOT ISNT JUST SOME UNPREDICTABLE TWIST BUT RATHER A CLEVER AND DETAILED FORMULA THAT ON THE SECOND WATCH, MAKES MUCH MORE SENSE AND ANSWERES ANY QUESTIONS AND LINKS CERTAIN MINOR, YET IMPORTANT LINKS BETWEEN THE CHARACTERS. I FOUND THE DELICIOUS SETUP OF THE FILM TO TREAD VERY CAREFULLY BETWEEN A CLASSIC HORROR SETTING, A HOTELL IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE ON A STORMY NIGHT, AND THE UNEXPECTED DEEP PSYCHOLOGICAL ROOTS THE CHARACTERS HAVE AND ARE DEFENSIVE AND PROTECTIVE OF. DESPITE THE DISSAPOINTING ALTERNATIVE ENDING ON THE DVD, ITS MERELY ADDED FLASH FRAMES TO THE ORIGINAL, THE DVD PICTURE IS FLAWLESS IN ITS ANAMORPHIC RATIO AND THE 5.1 SURROUND SOUND IS PERFECT FOR A MOVIE WITH THUNDER LIGHTNING AND NON STOP RAIN. BUY THIS DVD IF YOU WANT TO WATCH ONE OF THE MOST SUSPENSFUL AND ENTERTAINING MOVIES EVER MADE.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|I thouroughly enjoyed The Butterfly Effect from start to finish. It's not a fun film to watch, in fact, it's very tragic and depressing, but it's also engrossing, well-made, and exceptionally acted. Ashton Kutcher shows that not only can he pull off some funny pranks, but he can support a dramatic film as well. Melora Walters, with her meak voice and undeniable maternal presence, was the perfect choice to play his mother. Amy Smart, beautiful and innocent, was wonderful as Ashton's sometimes girlfriend. She had the most difficult job because she gets to change personalities so quickly, and she pulled it off very well.<br /><br />The film was brutal, way too honest, and at times, very tough to take, but I loved how it didn't shy away from the tragedies in life like most movies do. This is a terrific film, one of the best of the year in my opinion, that manages to leave a mark and lingers in the mind long afterward. It does try to tackle way too much in too short a period, but it manages to crawl under the skin and refuses to come out. After a string of very disappointing Hollywood thrillers, The Butterfly Effect was a very refreshing change of pace; a Hollywood thriller that actually thrills. The theatrical trailer, included on the DVD, did not do it justice.<br /><br />Note: While some viewers prefer the Direcor's Cut of the film, I was surprised because I think the Theatrical Version is a much better film. More tightly paced and with a far superior ending, the Theatrical Version is the definitive one to watch. Out of curiosity though, pop in the Director's Cut on the flip side and watch the final 5 minutes to see the main difference between both versions. While both are emotional, the Theatrical Version has a better ending that is more suitable to the film. Both versions are GREAT, but surprisingly, I prefer the original theatrical one since usually, the Direcor's Cut fairs better.<br /><br />I recommend this film. I absolutely loved it!
B00005JLXE|5.0|I APPROACHED THIS MOVIE VERY CAUTIOUSLY, EXPECTING IT TO FOLLOW IN THE TRADITION OF BAD SUPERHERO MOVIES, SPIDERMAN,XMEN,BATMAN AND ROBIN,ETC. UNLIKE THE PREVIOUS BAD EFFORTS, DAREDEVIL RETURNS TO THE DARK AND BREATHTAKING FORMULA OF THE EARLY TIM BURTON MOVIES BATMAN AND BATMAN RETURNS. THOUGH DIRECTOR MARK STEVEN JOHNSONS STYLE IS MUCH MORE MODERN AND GRIMY THAN BURTONS, BOTH DIRECTORS CERTAINLY KNOW HOW TO TAKE THIS SORT OF MOVIE SERIOUSLY. FIRST OF ALL THE ACTING IS BRILLIANT. PART OF WHAT MAKES THESE MOVIES FAIL IS THE ACTORS UNDERESTIMATING THE AUDIENCE, IE GEORGE CLOONEY. BEN AFFLECK IS PERFECTLY SUITED TO THE ROLE OF DAREDEVIL, AND MICHAEL CLARK DUNCAN IS ALSO WELL CASTED AS KINPIN. THE REAL SHOW STEALERS HERE ARE JENNIFER GARNER AS ELEKTRA AND COLIN FARRELL AS BULLSEYE, WHO WITHOUT A DOUBT SHARE THE MOST EFFECTIVE SCENE IN THE MOVIE, EXAMPLE: HOW MANY SUPERHEROES DIE ON THEIR FIRST NIGHT OUT? PERHAPS THE MOST WISE DECISION IN THIS FILM IS THAT THE SUPERHEROES DONT ACT LIKE SUPERHEROES AND MORE LIKE PEOPLE WHO KNOW HOW TO DO STUFF VERY WELL AND OUR CONSTANTLY TRAINING. MARK STEVEN JOHNSON ALSO KNOWS HOW TO ADD IMPACT TO SCENES, OFTEN USING MUSIC FROM THE FILMS SOUNTRACK WICH MATCHES IMACULATLY WITH THE CHARACTERS. THIS IS A WELL DESERVED TREAT FOR PEOPLE WHO DONT FIND THE CAMPY SPIDERMAN ENTERTAINING AND WHO ARE AFTER SOME DEPTH AND SUBSTANCE IN THEIR MOVIES.
0316168815|5.0|I enjoyed the book although sad it had a lot of feeling and it really gripped me. The reader Alyssa Bresnahan was really great.  I loved the idea of a heaven that is ideal for everyone and keeps changing as you 'grow'  I loved that she was able to look down on her family even though it was sad.  I really liked the ending.
6305903182|5.0|I LOVED THE FIRST SCREAM WITH A PASSION. I ENJOYED THE SECOND ONE BUT COULDNT HELP NOTICING CERTAIN BAD PLOT POINTS AND 1 TOO MANY REHASHES. THAT SAID I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING SCREAM 3 BUT WAS EXPECTING IT ONCE AGAIN TO GO DOWN A NOTCH FROM THE SECOND FILM. WAS I WRONG!!!!!!!!!! SCREAM 3 IS OUTSTANDING!!! YOU WILL NEVER BEAT THE ORIGINAL BUT MY GOD DOES THIS COME EVER CLOSE!!!!!! I FELT LIKE I WAS BACK IN THE CINEMA WATCHING THE SEQUEL TO SCREAM AND NOT THE CAMPY DAWSONS CREEK STYLE SCREAM2 THE MOVIE ACTUALLY WAS. IT INSULTED MY INTELLIGENCE. THE THIRD HOWEVER WAS BACK ON TRACK WITH A MUCH SHARPER PLOT AND AN INCREDIBLE CAST, PATRICK DEMPSEY, PARKER POSEY, LANCE HENRIKSEN WHO IS NOW IN 2 PERFECT MOVIE TRILOGYS THE OTHER BEING ALIEN. SCOTT FOLEY WAS ALSO A LITTTLE MORE SERIOUS AND HAD MORE OF A POINT THAN THE RIDICULOUS KILLERS FROM SCREAM2 AND IT WAS SUCH A SHOCK TO SEE LIEV SCHRIEBER IN THE OPENING SEQUENCE WICH HAS NEVER BEEN A CHARACTER WE ALREADY KNOW AND COULD FEEL FOR. IT WAS A LOT DARKER AND CLEVERER AND MANAGED TO CONNECT FLAWLESSLY BACK TO THE ORIGINAL MURDERS. I ALSO LOVED THE VOICE CHANGING DEVICE AND REALISED WE  DIDNT REALLY GET ANYTHING NEW FROM SCREAM2 AFTER SEEING WHAT SCREAM3 ADDED.  ALL IN ALL THE TRILOGY IS FANTASTIC AND FOR GODSAKE WES CRAVEN LEAVE IT BE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000148KK2|5.0|4.5 stars; 90% satisfaction.  How many artists provide 100% satisfaction?  Answer: none.  But to hear some reviewers, you'd think their standards were as high as their budgets are low.  Me --I don't mind risking a few beans, experimenting on CD's by different artists.  If I don't appreciate them, someone who shops at Salvation Army might.   <br /> <br />The recording is not all that different.  We're not talking here about an album of whale sounds.  It's been said (I think by me, actually) that Diana's albums have such awesome sound quality, her voice is so layered and rich, her musicianship so inspired yet not overdone, that she could record nursery rhymes and I would dig it.  But that would trivialize this effort so here's a thumbnail sketch of some of the tunes on this varied album: <br />\\"Stop This World\\" -Separated at birth from \\"Peel Me a Grape.\\" <br />\\"The Girl in the Other Room\\" -Moderately up-tempo, dark, enigmatic and very catchy. <br />\\"Temptation\\" -As close to \\"Pop\\" as Diana has come.  Good news for Pop.   <br />\\"Almost Blue\\" -Awesome bass.  Strong, smoky-bar-at-2 a.m.-ambience.  Will undoubtedly be covered by many others in the future. <br />\\"I've Changed My Address\\" -Torchy, intimate, autobiographical. <br />\\"Love Me Like a Man\\" -Way too robust and funky for jazz.  G' head, turn it up.   <br />\\"I'm Pulling Through\\" -Exquisite, tasteful.  Would fit perfectly on Diana's earlier (studio) CDs.  <br />\\"Black Crow\\" -Difficult, nuanced melody.  Trademark Mitchell: lotsa lyrics, not enough song.  But Diana's phrasing is superb.   <br />\\"Narrow Daylight\\" -Plaintive, thoughtful, Jackson Browne-sounding, as noted by another reviewer. <br />\\"Abandoned Masquerade\\" -A little somber.  Same goes for \\"I'm Coming Through.\\" <br />\\"Departure Bay\\" -Picturesque lyrics, tender melody.  Very nice, especially when you're in a mood. <br /> <br />What's all the concern about who writes Ms. Krall's songs?  Do we know anything about the guy who wrote \\"Frim Fram Sauce?\\"   Did he used to write polkas?  Who cares who wrote \\"Devil May Care?\\"  And \\"Why Should I Care?\\"  The issue never came up till Costello and Waits came on the scene.  Diana changed the way we feel about the Standards so when she takes a new direction, all bets are off.  It's worthwhile to be flexible.  By looking now beyond the Standards, a vast array of interesting possibilities awaits Krall fans. <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002234LS|3.0|SOMEHOW THE WRITER AND DIRECTOR OF THIS MOVIE HASNT BEEN CHARGED WITH PLAGERISM. FOLLOWING IN THE TRADITION OF MOVIES LIKE PRIMAL FEAR, IDENTITY, AND EVEN FIGHT CLUB, THIS IS YET ANOTHER TIRED SPIN ON THE CENTRAL CHARACTER HAVING MULTIPLE PERSONALITY SYNDROME. BUT UNLIKE THE PREVIOUS MOVIES, WHICH BOTHERED TO SET UP INTERESTING AND WELL WRITTEN CHARACTERS, THIS FILM GETS LAZY AND FOR SOME REASON THINKS THE \\"ULTIMATE TWIST\\" AT THE END OF THE FILM IS ENOUGH TO KEEP VIEWERS ENTERTAINED. JOHNNY DEPP IS WELL WORTH WATCHING BUT SEEMS WRONG FOR THE ROLE AND DESERVES A MUCH MORE INTERESTING CHANCE TO BE PARANOID AND SUPERSTITIOUS. HIS PERFORMANCE IN THE EXCEPTIONAL THRILLER NICK OF TIME WAS FLAWLESS AND MADE AUDIENCES CARE ABOUT HIS CHARACTER BECAUSE OF THE CHARACTERS VULNRABILITY HIS CHARACTER IN THIS MOVIE IS SO LAID BACK, HE ALMOST LOOKS LIKE HE IS ABOUT TO FALL ASLEEP. TIMOTHY HUTTON ALSO DESERVES MUCH BETTER AND CHARLES S. DUTTONS CHARACTER IS SO EVAUSIVE AND POINTLESS ITS HARD TO REMEMBER HOW GOOD HE WAS IN NICK OF TIME WITH JOHNNY. THIS IS A SORRY EFFORT FROM A PROMISING DIRECTOR AND WRITER OF THE MUCH MORE COMPELLING STIR OF ECHOES AND SADLY EVEN PANIC ROOM. THE LOOK OF THIS FILM IS A PERFECT LOCATION FOR A TAUGHT THRILLER FROM A STEPHEN KING NOVEL, BUT THE DIRECTOR JUST DOESNT MANAGE TO PULL OF THE FEELING OF CREEPY WOODS OR EVEN ISOLATION AS MANY POINTLESS CHARACTERS SEEM TO POP UP OUT OF NOWHERE AND DISAPPEAR WITH NO ANSWERS AS TO WHERE THEY WENT OR EVEN WHO THEY WERE. EXAMPLE; WHAT HAPPENED TO THE MYSTERIOUS ASSISTANT OF JOHNNYS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE FILM. NUMEROUS DIRECTIONS IN WHICH WAY THIS PLOT COULD HAVE GONE AND BEEN ORIGINAL AND INTERESTING ARE SADLY CLOSED OF AND THIS MOVIE TAKES OFF REMARKABLY SLOWLY DOWN A DEAD END STREET.
0316776963|5.0|David Sedaris is a master storyteller.  I'm still in awe of how tight and well-written Me Talk Pretty One Day is.  It is one of those rare, deceptively simple books that you can read in a couple of days, and then find yourself thinking in detail about the anecdotes contained therein.  There is so much more going on here than what you get on the surface. In one chapter, Sedaris spins a funny tale, and you're still howling with laughter as you turn the page and are immediately confronted with a poignant story about the pain of losing a pet.<br /><br />This is a book that definitely deserves a second read so you can laugh and cry your head off first, and then the second time around, pay attention to the way Sedaris composes the vignettes of his story, why he includes what he includes.  There's nothing accidental in the telling here.  Everything's there for a reason.
B00005JMEW|3.0|Kill Bill Vol. 2 is the second half of Quentin Tarantino's epic tale of bloody revenge, or \\"gory story\\" as the Bride so matter-of-factly puts it, about an ex-assassin turned bride-to-be whose decision to leave the murder-for-hire business doesn't go over too well with her employer Bill (David Carradine) This film, as well as its predecessor, is Tarantino's love letter to the genres he loves, most notably the grindhouse kung-fu films of the 70's, and of course the spaghetti westerns made famous by Sergio Leone. Much of the soundtrack a stark El Paso landscapes bring to mind Leone's 1967 masterpiece The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly perhaps a bit too often. To viewers not familiar with the film it may seem overdone or, at the very least, like a joke that loses its punchline.  <br />     Overall, what Tarantino has created is a shameless exercise in self-indulgence that seems too smart for its own good. In wanting to create depth to a story thats purpose is as direct and to the point as a punch in the face, much of the dialogue here seems artificial and sluggish. One of the film's low points occurs when Elle Driver (given little life by Daryl Hannah) meets with the wonderfully sympathetic Bud, one of the films few dynamic characters, to recover the Bride's custom made sword. In the scene, there is a conversation in which Bud questions the one-eyed blond vixen's feelings (\\"Which 'R' are you filled with: relief or regret?\\") It is these type of unnecassary rants, often delievered by the actors in jerky undertones, that lack the zip and quirky lyricism that populates so much of Tarantino's work. Consequently, for reasons that go unexplained, Elle has decided to sabotage Bud who is killed by a Black Mamba cobra snake. It makes us wonder why we just sat through ten minutes of useless chatter. Maybe she was just greedy and wanted it all for herself, but why would she just kill the brother of a man she seems to have deep feelings for? I guess the point is not to look too deeply into it, after all, it's just a simple tale of revenge. However, it seems at times that Tarantino is trying too hard to give the film a respectible running-time (137 minutes) by hiding behind cliches and silly metaphors like the Superman reference delivered by Bill before the climactic showdown (which lasts all of about twenty seconds)  <br />        With that being said, there are a few memorable moments in the film that have that trademark Tarantino-punch, which string together an otherwise uneven picture. The opening scene, flamboyantly titles the 'Massacre at Two Pines' (referring to the wedding chapel shootings that start this bloody revenge tale spinning) is a brilliant bit of choreography, particuarly in the set-up of the Bride's reunion with Bill, which is tragic and touching. The broken-hearted Bill delivers the great line, \\"I've never been nice in my whole life, but I'll do my best to be sweet.\\" The scene is shot in black and white and,in close-up, we see the battle worn features of a man left with only one option as he sees it. It is in the life they both lead. Another wonderfully executed sequence occurs as Uma is being buried alive by Bud and his pint-sized, beer guzzling friend Ernie. Tarantino offers us a blank screen where we hear but do not see the Bride being buried. The scene is so perfectly claustrophobic and frightening, it gives us the feel for the utter horror of her situation.  <br />        Walking out of Kill Bill Vol. 2 left me with a profound sense of confusion. Usually, after seeing a Tarantino film, I have no problem admitting that I have just seen a film that I enjoyed. And, fresh off a second viewing of Volume 1, I fully expected to see the same zip and distinctive craft here. Instead, what I witnessed was a movie made by a movie-lover who was willing to do whatever it took to satisfy his own interests and expectations.
B0002EXH54|2.0|I don't necessarily understand why Dave Mustaine thought that it was necessary to completely remaster and even re-record parts of these classic Megadeth albums. It's cool to remaster an album and clean it up a little, but rerecording even portions of it kind of takes away from the, I guess, \\"creativness\\" of it all. This might be the way the records were meant to sound, and it might even sound better, but I personally don't understand how Sanctuary or Dave or whoever is responsible could force these CDs on fans by (apparently) stopping distribution on all of the original albums. They made it hard for a fan like me, who personally loves the original Peace Sells (partly because of its under-produced, ragged sound) to finally replace an old cassette tape with a new copy of the ORIGINAL CD. (I found out the hard way by buying this CD and realizing that it sounded substancially different.)    I don't want to hear the Dave of today singing the vocals he originally recorded in 1984 or whenever. It just seems fake and like a desperate ploy to earn Mustaine a little money after what it seems like the flops of his last two records.
B00026YO36|4.0|This is the first solo Lanegan album I've bought, and I've been incredibly impressed by what I've heard. <br /> <br />To me, this is like Keith Richards singing the Death In Vegas album \\"The Contino Sessions\\" - it's unbelievably dark sometimes, but has this wonderfully threatening, gritty edge that keeps you hooked. <br /> <br />It's other strengths lie in the consistent strength of the songs, where the melodies unfold with each listen, and the sequencing has been very carefully planned so that the heavier rock songs appear towards the end - which is quite an interesting shift in dynamic for an album like this, where you would really expect these types of songs loaded at the front. <br /> <br />I just highly recommend this album to anyone. <br /> <br />
B00005JMJG|4.0|I was never a big fan of Jim Carrey (OK - 'Ace Ventura' is guilty pleasure), and I thought Charlie Kaufmann made some sort of Faustian agreement in Hollywood (wasn't 'Adaptation' a LITTLE too self-indulgent?).  That being said - I really enjoyed this film.  I remember seeing some old 'Twilight Zone' and/or 'Tales From the Darkside' episodes from the 80s, that pitched a similar plot - but with hypnotism.  The end result was cheesey and dismissive.  <br /> <br />Yes, Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet play their roles with aplomb to make this a powerful tragic love story.  However, what makes this a truly great film are the subplots.  Namely the relationships between Kirsten Dunst and Tom Wilkenson; and Elijah Wood and Kate Winslet.  At first, the viewer perceives these characters as simply 'filler' roles for comedy relief and scene transition.  Only as the film unfolds, does one understand the importance of each individual role and ultimately their significance for the film as a whole.   <br /> <br />Moreover, because the script is indeed clever, you can watch it time and again to appreciate some scenes that didn't quite make sense at the initial viewing and form some additional interpretations regarding the final scenes of the film.
B0001Z52RU|4.0|This film is an excellent spin on a fascinating and well-trodden concept. If one scans their memory, it has been done many times before in numerous ways. There was that familiar Simpson's episode where old Homer, in his usual fashion, accidentally creates a time machine in an effort to fix the family toaster, merely stepping on a flower or insect in the distant past, thereby altering the very fabric of future society. There was also Richard Bach's much-underrated 80's novel, \\"One\\", describing his and his wife Leslie's travels through alternate realities and dimensions. This was a good novel. The basic premise for all these stories are essentially the same, and that is, the choices we make in life, however small or mundane, can have a tremendous effect on our future circumstances.<br /><br />The Butterfly Effect is a moral tale and a love story. Similar to H.G. Wells' The Time Machine, traveling back in time to prevent the death of a loved one or the destiny of a loved one will not always turn out the way we want it to. The moral message in the film, I believe, is that we are ultimately responsible for our own condition, and the choices we make in life determine our destinies. But what if we could travel back in time and change our choices? And by making different choices, how profoundly would it affect the outcome of our lives? This concept also begs the question - is our future pre-determined?<br /><br />Ashton Kutcher delivers a good performance as the reluctant and later, obsessive traveler of alternate time. This film showed me that Kutcher has talent as an actor and could well go far in the profession. The two younger versions of his character also put in excellent performances, particularly the younger one of the two. It was also a pleasure to see Eric Stoltz again, as the character showed me that Stolz could just about play anything with believability.<br /><br />This film certainly cranks along and remains compelling to the end. And the film's ending, really, could have gone in many directions. The conclusion the writer's chose, however, was appropriate, as it rounded out this chaotic and at times complex tale, leaving the audience with a sense of closure. All in all, an entertaining film, with the added value of something to think about., really, could have gone in many directions. The conclusion the writer's chose, however, was appropriate, as it rounded out this chaotic and at times complex tale, leaving the audience with a sense of closure.

B0002IU988|1.0|I was very disappointed in this CD. Creed was a solid band with lots of great hits. There is not one hit single on this album. I wasted $13 on it. They need to get Scott Stapp back.
B00005JNEI|5.0|...  I can't wait to share this DVD with everyone I know who says \\"I wouldn't give Michael Moore $8 of my hard-earned money\\" (although I don't know any of them personally; they only seem to exist on message boards and as anonymous movie reviewers).  When I saw this in a theater of applauding and crying suburbanites on its opening weekend, I knew that Michael Moore had hit a home run -- a movie that couldn't fail to touch any truly undecided voter.  Nobody can watch this movie without coming away convinced by Michael Moore's humanity AND true patriotism (and questioning that of our 43rd President).<br /><br />-<br /><br />If I were going to add a special DVD featurette though, I'd suggest a tape of GWB's seven minutes in the Florida classroom on 9/11/2001 with NO cuts and NO narration, just a clock in the corner of the screen.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Slipknots first two albums never did anything for me before. I always thought they were more of a gimmick band for Hot Topic kids to eat up. But with this album theyve improved dramatically. The lyrics arent angsty, dramatic and violent, and are actually pretty intelligent, especially compared to some of the other crap being played on the radio. The guitar in this is actually audible. Some of the guitar parts are pretty interesting, and theres even a few solos on here. One of the members who I always thought had talent even when I hated Slipknot was Joey Jordison. Hes a very good drummer and he shows it here, although he doesnt get to show it quite as much because the album isnt that heavy, but its a good trade off. My favorite songs here are \\"The Blister Exists\\", \\"Circle\\" and \\"Before I Forget\\", but no songs here strike me as being very weak. If you never liked Slipknot before, at least give this album a try. And as far as all the Hot Topic kids disappointed with this album, get over it. Screaming, whining and crying does not make an album good.
B0002IU988|5.0|Ok i've only listened to the single but the guy below me is a total tool. If you don't like something don't buy it. I personally like creed and if people don't like it then don't buy it. He or she probably listens to \\"hard core\\" music and plays in his crappy band that is \\"better than creed\\" and hates on bands that are popular just b/c he isn't. Online no less. Buy the CD and judge yourself but don't listen to the dork below you. Oh and i like the single yea it sounds like creed but what do you expect it has 3/4 members of creed. <br /> <br />later
B0001XWV1C|5.0|Eurotrip was alright for a movie that has stuff in it you don't often see like a nude beach with all guys.When I first saw that, I was a little disturbed, but now I guess I'm ok with it. There are many naughty scenes.I thought Fiona was pretty hot in the beginning! Don't mind the naughty stuff, this is altogether a good one that belongs in your video collection.
B000092Q4U|5.0|Revolver Magazine dubbed this \\"the most devastating album of the year\\".  I think that pretty well sums it up.  This is a masterfully crafted heavy metal album.  Randy Blythe's vocals might be the most unique in metal, and they fit perfectly with the dark and fast pace of this CD.  My only gripe is that since Randy's vocals are so low, they sometimes get drowned out by the rest of the band.  Hopefully their next album, their major label debut on Epic Records titled \\"Ashes of the Wake\\", will fix this problem. Even with this slight problem, this is still one of the best metal albums in recent memory.
B000286S8S|1.0|I just wish I could strike that whining idiot Hagar down that's for sure. This album is crap crap crap!  Even Euruption is boring to listen to now.  I mean some of this music is over 25 years old for fu**s sake.  As for the newer material, god Eddie, what the hell have you been doing all this time? What I use to like about the early stuff was that you had never heard anything like it before, it was fresh.  When DLR left, VH's experimental side slipped.  They are now 'has been's' and this crap album shows.
B00005QZ7U|4.0|Back in the days before Chicago came out and blew us all away, musical theatre afficionadoes like myself pretty much had no choice but to watch Moulin Rogue if we wanted to see a movie musical made in the past twenty years.  I must admit that my initial impression of the film was none too flattering.  The first thirty minutes or so of the film make a good case for how MTV has killed movie making, cutting so frequently that the viewer is merely disoriented.  If a movie could have ADD, this movie would be the poster child for such a condition. <br /> <br />Yet as the movie progressed, it began to grow on me when it finally slowed down enough to focus on the love story between Nicole Kidman and Euan McGregor.  By the second hour the movie found its stride, combining colorful theatrics with some heart-wrenching drama.  By the end, I was throughly involved in this tale of love and loss in turn of the century Paris and only regretted the movie hadn't come together sooner. <br /> <br />In the lead roles, Euan McGregor and Nicole Kidman do excellent work.  Kidman's singing voice isn't the greatest, but she acts her part so well that her thin-voiced singing ends up not mattering.  Plus, you gotta give the girl credit for doing all her own vocals instead of having them dubbed over by someone else.  She fully commits the role, and although she didn't (and shouldn't) win the Oscar she certainly earned a spot among the nominees.  Euan McGregor, on the other hand, has a spectacular singing voice, and I for one was amazed by his range and versatility.  Like Kidman, he is totally commited to the part, and the two share an undeniable chemistry. <br /> <br />Moulin Rouge's flawed first half keep it from greatness, but Baz Luhrmann definitely gets points for trying.  He also gets points for making a movie musical when it wasn't the in thing (or even the financial sound thing) to do.  In a sense, Moulin Rouge paved the way for Chicago and hopefully other movie musicals to follow.  Although Chicago is a better film, Moulin Rouge certainly has its moments and is overall a very satisfying piece of cinema.
B0002IU988|5.0|Creed's musical memebers have transformed to form Alter Bridge and ultimately establish one amazing band.  One reviewer has exposed his ignorance by saying that the guitarist is horrible and that there is no guitar talent on this album. NOT TRUE! In fact, Tremonti's talent shines through more on this one album than on all of Creed's combined.  Creed was good for the time, but this band could possibly be the band for the decade. 60's: Beatles 70s: Led Zeppelin 80s: Van Halen/everyone 90s: Soundgarden/Pearl Jam/STP/Nivana/ 2000s: Alterbridge??? VERY possible.
B00005JLSE|5.0|Who would have thought an age where movie musicals are all but non-existant would produce one of the most entertaining film musicals of all time?  Although stylistically very different from such acknowledged greats as Singing in the Rain, West Side Story, and My Fair Lady, Chicago easily earns a place among those aforementioned classics.  The film takes the dark source material (made even more so by Bob Fosse's original direction) and transfers it to screen in all its delightful decadence, assaulting the senses and challenging the modern preception of what a musical should be.  The world of musical theatre has changed quite a bit since the 1960s heyday of movie musicals, and Chicago offers a glimpse into the more mature world of today's musicals. <br /> <br />The story centers around Roxie Hart, who kills her lover and then attempts to parlay the publicity into a career in showbiz.  Along the way she runs across the similar-minded Velma Kelly, and both of them end up vying for the attention of hotshot lawyer Billy Flinn.  If the story sounds a bit darker than the sugar-coated musicals of Rodgers & Hammerstein, it is, yet there is a sense of fun about the entire event that is infectious.  The movie's plot unfolds through some fast-paced and wonderfully acted dialogue scenes, along the way touching upon America's obsession with fame. <br /> <br />Of course, the movie's bread and butter are the musical numbers, and Rob Marshall has come up with the brilliant idea of most of the songs being imagined by Roxie and therefore taking place only in her head.  This works especially well for the material, in which most of the numbers comment upon the action rather than reveal plot.  However, Marshall intercuts the songs with plot-advancing tibits, and although some seem turned off by this cut-cut-cut editing choice, I think it gives the movie a kinetic energy that helps speed things along. <br /> <br />The numbers themselves are lavishly and inventively staged, and each song manages to differentiate itself from the rest.  Marshall never repeats himself, and the result is a movie which keeps the audience guessing.  Standouts include the famous opening number \\"All That Jazz\\" and \\"The Cell Block Tango,\\" which sport simply jaw-dropping choreography and a showmanship that most movie musicals strive for but never achieve. <br /> <br />And then there's the talent.  All of the actors do their own singing and dancing, and I personally had no idea some of these actors were so talented.  Renee Zellweger's Roxie Hart is at once vulnerable yet tenacious, and she handles her songs well.  She especially scores with \\"Roxie,\\" and to a lesser extent with \\"Nowadays.\\"  Richard Gere's absolutely charming as self-centered lawyer Billy Flinn, with his tap dance towards the end of the film being his defining moment. <br /> <br />But the real finds are Queen Latifa and especially Catherine Zeta-Jones.  Each of them does some stellar work with their dialogue scenes, displaying sharp comic timing and the sort of nuancing only the most accomplished performers achieve.  Both ladies belt out their numbers with confidence, with Latifa using her music background to score a homerun with the showstopping \\"When Your Good to Mama.\\"  Meanwhile, Catherine Zeta-Jones sings, dances, and acts her way to a well-deserved Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her portrayal of Velma Kelly, stealing just about every scene she's in.  Her take on \\"All That Jazz\\" is nearly worth the price of admission alone.  And as a bonus, the DVD release includes the cut duet for Jones and Latifa entitled \\"Class,\\" which is one of the funnier numbers in the score. <br /> <br />Chicago is one for the ages, combining a decidely adult and yes, slightly cynical slant with glorious production numbers and brilliant acting.  Anyone with an open mind will enjoy this movie, and as a musical theatre nut I thank God for Rob Marshall's work on this film.  Hopefully, it will pave the way for a second golden age of movie musicals.

I've read just about everything Kirkman has done voraciously, including the small print Battle Pope (bring on tha' whores!). Other titles that are extremely awesome are Invincible, a new take on the super-hero genre. The now defunct Tech-Jacket was a good sci-fi yarn (bring it back! And Space Dog too!) Hell, this dude even got picked up by Marvel (sellout) of all things. Check out his current run on Captain America with the whole Avengers Dissaseembled mess going on (but Batroc? Man, c'mon thats lame. A leaping bad guy. Real threataning. i.e. Toad from X-Men, what a chump). Kirkman is a great guy and a great new tallent that is on his way on the up and up. Excelcior!    cough*28DAYSLATERRIPOFF*cough
B00012FXAE|5.0|Already a contender for the status of a legendary classic James Cameron's 1986 classic sequel to \\"Alien\\" entitled \\"Aliens\\" is a grand leap forward from the Ridley Scott original and adding a whole new dimension to the Alien saga while maintaining the thrills that made the original such a great movie. The first one relied on immense suspense to scare it's audience but this one brings forth far more action for it's plot.<br /><br /> Ellen Ripley is in hibernation through cryogenic suspension on the space ship she got on to escape from the planet that the deadly predatory alien inhabited. 57 years later after being the only survivor of the encounter with the alien creature, Ripley is found and rescued by a deep space crew and revived. Upon being revived on Planet Earth, Ellen Ripley discovers that to her utmost horror, the planet that she escaped from 57 years earlier has been colonized by a Company that wants to expand its businesses to other planets. The colony called LV-426 had been growing and was starting to prosper when contact with it is suddenly lost completely and unable to be restored.<br /><br /> A team of Space Marines is formed and Ellen Ripley along with the Marines are sent back to the planet to investigate what might have possibly happened that could've caused contact to be completely lost with the colony and if something horrible has happened, they must try to rescue the survivors...if there are any at all. Ellen Ripley discovers that her greatest nightmare to date has come true. The alien species is thriving well and killed all of the colonists except for one which is a little girl named Rebecca `Newt' Jordan who survived for over a year alone hiding in the complex ventilation systems of the buildings. Even worse is that the former headquarters of the colony is now host to a large nest of alien eggs. Now they must try to escape the remains of the colony and destroy the nest but the aliens are numerous and attack in numbers and are much deadlier than the one Ripley fought more than a half-century before then. The alien nest is also host to an alien queen, an alien that lays numerous eggs that will hatch facehuggers that will cause far more Aliens to be hatched from their hosts. It turns out that the colonists that lived on there have been made into hosts for the spawn of the alien queen. They have no idea of how the alien species had escaped from confinement but the answer to that may be very shocking.<br /><br /> This sequel is arguably one of the greatest sequels ever made even to this day in so many ways. I don't know what happened but just about everything that could work on here works perfectly. The storyline is powerful and brilliant. I really love the way that this movie builds up in suspense in the first half and then is almost non-stop action from there forth. The movie is dark, but highly futuristic.<br /><br />The characters are very well defined and show enormous personality. The atmosphere is bleak and intense but lots of fun. First off James Cameron was the perfect choice for directing this movie. Coming hot off the heels of \\"The Terminator\\" two years before then, the relatively low budget of only 18 Million dollars was put to its most efficient use with his directing. The special effects are stunningly amazing, brilliant and rich in detail and don't look dated at all and this is taking into account that CGI didn't exist back at that point in time.<br /><br /> The aliens in this movie looked so much more realistic and far more terrifying than the one in the first one. They looked the most realistic of just about any aliens that I've seen in any science fiction movie even more so than the ones from 1996's \\"Independence Day\\". The Alien queen is the best alien creature out of all four of the entries in the saga and the egg-laying sac, although a bit gross-looking was very realistic looking. I loved the way all of the equipment and the weapons that the Space Marine crew had looked like. My favorite setwas the mechanical humanoid machine that Ripley steps into in the climax. The sounds of the machine guns firing their rounds will never be forgotten.<br /><br /> The acting by the entire cast is incredible. James Cameron's work on making the characters really honest and vivid paid off on here. Ellen Ripley is the greatest action movie heroine of all time. Of all of the movies I've seen Sigourney Weaver star in, \\"Aliens\\" remains her best role to date as of writing this review. Her acting on here is legendary and Ripley acting as a surrogate mother to the sole survivor of the colony Newt is powerful. Starring in her only movie role, Carrie Henn at only around ten years is the best kind role of any movie I've ever seen. Newt in a way is very chilling to watch and even scary sometimes considering how she survives for so long in the colony alone with the aliens lurking around. I sometimes find it occasionally a bit troubling to watch nowadays especially that I sometimes don't like seeing scenarios of kids being in dangerous situations. Michael Biehn as Corporal Hicks is amazing as well. Paul Reiser as the traitorous Burke is great as well. Although nowhere near as prevalent, Jeanette Goldstein is an awesome riot as the fiery-tempered macho Corporal Alvarez! Watching her in this movie is so much fun and she shows lots of spunk and attitude. Let's not forget Bill Paxton playing the Space Marine who was starting to get paranoid towards the latter half of the movie. I gotta hand it to the world, this movie has a brilliant cast and it couldn't have been better!<br /><br /> The \\"Collector's Edition\\" DVD is fantastic! The picture and sound quality of the \\"Collector's Edition\\" are so superior to the old VHS edition as well. The original version benefits from both improvements. The first disc contains the 1986 original and it also comes with a 1991 extended edition which contains 17 minutes of previously unreleased footage that fleshes out the characters and expands the storyline. One scene in the extended edition warrants seeing the 1991 edition as it really expands on Ripley's checkered past.<br /><br /> The second disc is also a treasure to gain a hold of as well. One of my favorite bonus features is seeing how they made all of the awesome sets especially with the alien queen and how they made it look so realistic when Ripley shoots the grenades at the egg-laying sac. The one with the human robot that Ripley uses to battle the alien is also really spectacular and how they filmed it was really worth seeing. You can also see some really awesome production galleries of the various scenes and how they built all of the many sets and how they did some of the really awesome effects especially with how much more primitive movie-making technology was at the time. The second disc also contains great commentary by the cast and crew of the making of this set and how they look back on it today. Even Carrie Henn comments on her role and when she talks about how she loved one of the sets she was in. It's really funny to watch. There are hours of other features on here that are worth seeing. You will love every second of the hours you spend watching this disc.<br /><br /> This movie had a lot to live up to considering the great scales of its predecessor but it not only did that but it surpass it to become what is arguably the greatest sequel of all time. This is likely one of my favorite sequels of all time alongside \\"Terminator 2\\" which was also directed by James Cameron.

B0000039PW|5.0|The debut album \\"Ready to Die\\" by the one and only Notorious B.I.G. easily ranks in my top 5 CD's of all time. Biggie's lyrics are one of a kind. Likewise, the production is amazing from start to finish. Standout songs in my opinion are Machine Gun Funk, One More Chance, The What, Every Day Struggle, Big Poppa, and Unbelievable. However, the other songs just barely fall short. If you do not own this CD, I highly recommend you buy it as soon as possible.
B0001Z53AQ|1.0|Take a minute to read this before you skip past because you love Eminem or whatever.    D12 are all very talented - Eminem has his ability to rap as several different characters and produce, Kon Artis can sing and produce, Proof has his freestyling talent, Kuniva and Swifty can spit some ill lyrics too. A lot of people think that Bizarre can't rap. This is because they have only heard the commercialised D12 stuff and I agree fully that Bizarre is weak on these albums.     At the time when Eminem hadn't blown up, D12 were trying to make a name for themselves, they had to rap well to get heard and accepted on the streets. Now that they have sold their millions, they are just trying to get the record sales and that's it. If you take DJ Butter's Kill The DJ Mixtape, you don't hear Bizarre just talking along to the beat, or Eminem doing his stupid commercial rapping - they really make an effort. Now, it's just \\"Oh, everyone wants a new D12 album - I guess we'd better go to the studio and whip something up\\". They don't care about lyrics anymore, it's just commercial topics, nothing new whatsoever. If you want to hear D12 as excellent emcees, don't buy this. If you want to hear the commercial rubbish that gets on MTV, then you'll love it.    When D12 rap with fellow Detriot emcees, they don't care if it sells or sounds \\"cool\\", they just want to drop an ill verse, regardless.(...)  The bottom line is, you'll like every song if you're into the commercial side of rap like DMX, Ja Rule, 50 Cent etc, but if you like real hip hop like Dr Dre's old stuff, Royce Da 5'9 (one of the best lyricists in my opinion), KRS One etc, you'll probably prefer their underground stuff. If you've read through this review and aren't really shure if you understand what I'm talking about, I suggest you get this album used, and also download some songs from the link, and decide for yourself. Hope this helps.

B00023BLXK|3.0|Was it lack of money?  <br /> <br />I believe the producers could have hired professional dancers for the title roles. They did so for the background and it was great. <br /> <br />So what's lacking is professionalism.  <br /> <br />The actors do a creditable job, their dancing is OK without adding anything. The story is ho-hum, with a little unobtrussive mention of the Batista regime and Fidel Castro but with no specifics. <br /> <br />All in all, as I said, a good dog. <br /> <br />3 stars for trying. 0 for lack of success.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Space Above and Beyond, was, until Firefly, the finest blend of Sci-Fi genre and thought provoking storytelling, to date, in my humble estimation. The fusion of gritty froniter and slick technology is a refreshing approach to beloved albiet innundated genre. The characters are easy to identify with and keep you guessing as they draw you into their world. The visual fabric woven through set design, special effects, CGI and wardrobe are at a level many films fail to achieve, let alone television series. Details like the gun holstered at Mal's side looks sleek and futuristic while paying homage to an old Colt 44 made famous by Clint Eastwood in many a western. It's details such as these that lend there weight to a stellar team of craftsman, giving Firefly, \\"heavyweight\\" status in an already crowded ring.

B00004RD54|4.0|i actually do not own this cd; my wife was rummaging through an old box of tapes to make a tape of a radio show and taped over a compilation (remember those) i'd labored over, likely 20 years ago. i put about selected trax from about five of the top live cds i'd ever heard (dylan/before the flood, grateful dead/europe 72, bowie/changes live, allmans/fillmore) and i'll bet i hadn't heard the selections in over fifteen years. as everyone else says, the moment when the two guitar soloists back of and let lou take the stage is simply a rock orgasm of the highest order. the first time i heard it, first year of university, yes, folks, THIRTY YEARS AGO, i had goosebumps the size of golf balls on my body. and when i heard it tonight, i thought \\"damn, i have no time for nostalgia, but this is just about the best rock music i've ever heard.\\" yes, lou did diss it in later times, but the hunter/wagner/prakash john band was simply stunning. it was 'rock and roll' indeed...
0812550706|5.0|A friend loaned me this book, and it sat on my shelf for months.  \\"Just some book about some kid who outsmarts adults, not like I haven't heard that lame plot before,\\" I thought. <br /> <br />I was completely wrong.  This is an astonishing piece of science fiction, political maneuvering, military theory, and most of all, human nature. <br /> <br />You can read the plot summaries elsewhere.  I think it compares favorably with Heinlein's \\"Starship Troopers\\", although the approach is completely different.  What I liked about the book was how it manipulated me, the reader, into believing certain things that, in the end, weren't true at all.  Fascinating exposition, tense unwinding, and just enough character development of the supporting cast to keep it believable.
B0000C6E4D|3.0|I have always thought that what separates Sarah McLachlan from the rest of the pop world is her exquisite songwriting, so evident on the CDs Fumbling Towards Ecstasy, Surfacing and even Solace.  She created songs that captured emotions and transmitted it to the listener pure and unaltered.  She didn't resort to using tired cliches but instead dug deeper.  Hence, instead of belting out \\"I can't live if living is without you...\\"  she softly sings \\"deep within I'm shaken by the violence of existing for only you...\\" in Do What You Have To Do.  And you feel it.<br /><br />  Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of this release.  Much of the songwriting is mediocre and sometimes downright trite.  Here's a verse from the CDs last song,, Dirty Little Secret (which I have to say I downright dislike):<br /><br />\\"Been up all night drinking to drown my sorrows down<br /><br />But nothing seems to help me since you've gone away<br /><br />I'm so tired of this town where every tongue is wagging<br /><br />When every back is turned<br /><br />Theyre telling secrets that should never be revealed<br /><br />Theres nothing to be gained from this but disaster\\"<br /><br />Musically, the CD is also unremarkable.  It doesn't really have hooks that stay with you, ala Surfacing, nor does it challenge you like FTE did.  It's background music for the most part.<br /><br />The saving grace?  Sarah's voice.  Occassional flashes of brilliance.  And the fact that the CD is pleasant enough to listen to.<br /><br />'Fallen' has a good hook but there is an emotional disconnect.  'World on Fire', Sarah's song for post 9/11 world reality is good but not great.  'Stupid', I don't like despite being mentioned by many reviewers here as one of the better songs.  I think it's just a wee bit adolescent.  'Trainwreck' has great hook and one of the best songs here.  'Push' is unimaginative but sincere.  It actually works for the most part.  But I must say that after the movie Jerry McGuire, no one should have the lyrics 'You complete me' in their songs.  'Answer' is haunting but does not quite reach the level of 'Angel'.  'Time' has its moments but like many songs here, is too bland.  'Perfect girl' is just boring.  And 'Dirty Little Secret' should have been kept a secret.<br /><br />P.S.  I saw Sarah live in Philadelphia a couple weeks back and the concert was fantastic.  Especially when she sang her old songs.  :)u complete me' in their songs.

B000021Y77|5.0|I've watched \\"Run Lola Run\\" three times now --once at an arthouse theatre when it first opened, again after purchasing the DVD about a year ago, and again this past week.<br /><br />The first time I watched the DVD, I hadn't realized that there were two different versions --dubbed and subtitled-- on the disk. My wife and I watched the dubbed version and we were both VERY disappointed. Even if you don't understand a lick of German (and we don't), the subtitled one allows you to better gauge the emotions of the original performance. Actors dubbing in the dialogue after-the-fact, rarely, if ever, can match the impact of the original.<br /><br />Last week, I watched it again with a friend --but only after having turned the disk over to the subtitled side.<br /><br />Lola has received a frantic phone call from her boyfriend, Manni. He had left a sack containing 100,000 German Marks on a train... money that he was going to be turning over to his mobster boss in 20 minutes. If he doesn't have the money when he meets his boss, he's dead.<br /><br />Lola dashes out of her apartment with no general idea of how she's going to come up with 100,000 Marks, and interacts with a number of people along the way.<br /><br />As for the lesson in (anti) theology... (from my perspective, anyway)<br /><br />The anti-theological point of RLR is that the most minute change in any event has a cascading effect where the resulting outcome may bear no resemblance to the events that would occur had the minor changes not taken place. In other words, this film is going to disturb the \\"events are pre-ordained by God\\" crowd.<br /><br />Early in each of her three runs, Lola encounters a nasty old woman, but with the *slightest* variation between the encounters. The first time, they clip shoulders as she runs past... the woman sneers and calls Lola a name, and then the film offers about a dozen \\"snapshots\\" of the events that follow in the woman's life. (Something involving the government taking her children... or perhaps she had kidnapped them in the first place. I can't say for certain.)<br /><br />The second encounter with the woman results in a much bigger bump... almost knocking the woman over. The woman turns and calls Lola a VERY bad name, but this time the forward-flash snapshots show the woman winning the lottery.<br /><br />In their final encounter, Lola has left the apartment without tripping, and therefore breezes past the old woman because she gets to the same spot about a second earlier. The woman STILL sneers at her, (but does not call her a name!), and this time we witness the next events in her life: Pretty much a mundane snapshot, sitting watching TV with her husband.<br /><br />There were a handful of encounters with different people, and evey minor change created enough changes in the fabric of events that the final outcome was very different.<br /><br />Theists are sure to point out though, that there WAS one scene that would seem to argue on the side of events being pre-ordained: In each of the three segments, a man has a car accident, even though each accident takes place in a different way and at a diffent time. The man of course was DESTINED to have a wreck!<br /><br />Personally, I think they included these scenes to make you think about it... but my personal opinion is that if there were a FOURTH run, (or a fifth or a sixth!), he eventually WOULDN'T have the wreck.<br /><br />Besides, the dramatic differences in outcome for Lola and Manni ought to outweigh any suggestion of pre-destiny for what is a minor scene in the film.nt taking her children... or perhaps she had kidnapped them in the first place.

0140288503|5.0|Mark Bowden is truly a great author. This narrative, focusing on the fateful Battle of Mogadishu, is very detailed. You can tell -- it's quite a long book for covering maybe 24 hours of battle. Bowden did his homework, and it shows. After the right amount of background info (not too much, but enough to establish the scene), Bowden goes right into the story. There is little bias (if any), and this even-handed, detailed narrative is informative and, having read many other great miltary authors (Rick Atkinson, Gordon Prange, Stephen Ambrose), I have to say, Mark Bowden is one of the best military writers.

0783232039|1.0|That's the kind of cheap humor that \\"Bride Of Chucky\\" has, and obviously the producers of the \\"Child's Play\\" sequels think that the audience is plain stupid, \\"let's make a half-cooked movie, with idiotic jokes, and cheap actors, it doesn't matter because the audience is fool enough to buy a ticket\\", it's an insult that with all the potential that the world of the movies has, movies like this (with a 5 pages script, stiff performances, ridiculous jokes and so little intelligence) are still being made.    To be honest, I kinda liked this movie back in 1998, but I was in high school so I guess that this \\"movie\\" is good enough to entertain 16 year old teens. \\"Bride Of Chucky\\" continues the downward spiral of the \\"Child's Play\\" sequels, compared to this junk, \\"Child's Play\\" 1 & 2 are two glorious, inventive masterpieces, wich they are not by the way. Although the first one is good and the second part is amusing.    \\"Bride Of Chucky\\" has a collection of pathetic performances, as a matter of fact, the best performances are only vocal, that's right Brad Dourif as Chucky and Jennifer Tilly as Tiffany are the only performances that are OK, but that doesn't matter, because the thin script and the dull jokes ruin their performances. So Chucky needed an amulet to return to a human body, huh? Then why he bothered to chase Andy in the first 3 movies if he didn't had the amulet? He even recited his chant to transfer his soul to Andy, and he didn't had the silly thing with him.    There is a picture of the dead body of Charles Lee Ray in a newspaper, and in the first movie a lightning hit the body after he passed his soul to the doll, so don't be afraid if you are struck by a lightning because according to \\"Bride Of Chucky\\", you won't get burned. Oh, and be sure that you keep your female dolls in one room, and your male dolls in other room, because according to \\"Bride Of Chucky\\", your female dolls could get pregnant. And be sure that you aren't around when the baby doll is borne, because he will jump right to you with his sharp teethes.     And now there is  going to be an upcoming fifth part of the \\"Child's Play\\" series, but I think that it couldn't be as bad as \\"Bride Of Chucky\\", but if Hollywood has proven something, is that they don't care for the intelligence of the viewers as long as they pay for a ticket or a DVD.
B00028HBKM|4.0|Let's get one point straight - this is is exactly what the title says it is - the Passion of the Christ. It is not a life of Christ or an explanation of Jesus's ministry. It is a medieval passion play toned down and put on film. The violence is appalling but not nearly as bloody and humiliating as a real crucifixion. For some insight into that, see Thomas Cahill's \\"Desire of the Everlastng Hills\\". <br /> <br />Using the ancient languages was interesting, but done with a medieval perspective. It is more likely that the Romans <br />conversed with the Jews in Greek rather than Latin, since Greek was the common tongue of the eastern Mediterranean at that time. <br /> <br />This picture makes its point well, but there is quite a bit of non-gospel tradition and outright speculation mixed in.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Take Me Away: 5/5 The whole song is awesome. Probably my third favorite. <br /> <br />Together: 5/5 I'm attracted to the chorus. <br /> <br />Don't Tell Me: 3/5 I listened to it way too often so now I don't like it as much. :( I like the message of the song, though. (Don't have sex with guys who only wanted you for sex.) <br /> <br />He Wasn't: 3/5 Not much melody. More like a bratty girl complaining about a guy. <br /> <br />How Does It Feel: 3/5 I don't like the beginning too much, but it gets better. <br /> <br />My Happy Ending: 5/5 This is my favorite song throughout the albums even before the MTV started showing it. (No, I'm really not an MTV addict.) I can relate with it very well right now. I kind of hate the way they changed the s word to &#34;stuff,&#34; cause it really changes the meaning, but I guess kids can't sing it if it stayed original. <br /> <br />Nobody's Home: 4/5  <br /> <br />Forgotten: 4/5 I love the guitar. <br /> <br />Who Knows: 4/5 Strangely, the chorus is the worst part of the song. <br /> <br />Fall to Pieces: 5/5 This is my second favorite song in this album. A little bit out of character, though. (&#34;I just wanna cry in front of you.&#34; &#60;why would Avril cry in front of a guy??&#62;) <br /> <br />Freak Out: 3/5 For some reason I just don't like this song that much. <br /> <br />Slipping Away: 5/5 I can't relate to the song, but I love the chorus. <br /> <br />Conclusion: This album is totally different from Avril's previous album. I miss her lighter and catchier songs, but these songs are great, too, in their own way. That being said, Avril has definitely lost her trademark.
B0002A2WDQ|4.0|Crossroads is one of those movies that at the time wasn't a hit but over time, people have rediscovered it and it's become sort of a cult classic. When you think of Ralph Macchio as a blues guitar slinger it seems like a blatant miss-cast but how he plays the main character is actually what gives the movie its charm. Not to mention the fact that the devil's main guitar slinger is played by a young and relatively unknown guitar player by the name of Steve Vai!! And the swagger was there back in the day. Anyways, the soundtrack is great and Ry Cooder really captures the feeling of the movie overall and there's some great slide work. The picture quality is good and the sound quality is clean. Keep in mind that this was made in the 80's but it's a definite improvement over VHS. Crossroads is definitely one to add to your collection
B0002IU988|2.0|First off i will not compare this album to anything by creed. next, this album is boring. the lyrics suck and couldve been written by a  13 year old. every song has the same feel to it and gets very repetious. every once and awhile the guitarist will do some cool stuff but other than that he never changes the tone or effects of his guitar. the lead singer sounds odd like he doesnt fit in with the songs - it almost sound kareokee like. i give this album 2 stars and not 1 b/c i save 1's for garbage - for which this is boarderline. this album makes good music for people who dont know music very well.
0783225482|4.0|\\"Death Becomes Her\\" is a comedy with a very talented cast, in this movie we can see Meryl Streep, Goldie Hawn, Bruce Willis and Isabella Rossellini in the lead roles. Usually action heroes like Sylvester Stallone or Arnold Schwarzenneger try to change bullets and explosions for jokes and comedy, but to be honest they are not very funny, but Bruce Willis really is able to portray comedic roles.    \\"Death Becomes Her\\" has outstanding make-up and good visual effects that in the early 1990s were some of the most impressive special effects, and even though the special effects have come really far in these days, the scenes still look realistic and they don't look cheap at all, like other movies whose special effects look dated today.    This movie is a black comedy with some splashes of satire, and there are some scenes that contain strong visual images (like the scene where Goldie gets a huge hole in her stomach), but the humor is applied so well to these images that instead of being grotesque, they produce laughs and creative humor.    The performances in \\"Death Becomes Her\\" are very good, Meryl and Goldie are awarded actresses that proof that they are able to portray comedic roles as good as dramatic roles. Bruce Willis has a special timing for comedy and that results in a good performance, and Isabella Rossellini plays a small, but significant role, and she looks great in this movie.    \\"Death Becomes Her\\" is a very funny comedy with inventive jokes, good performances and solid visual effects.
B000002UA0|5.0|Pink Floyd released their debut album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn in 1967, at a time when psychedelic music was in full bloom. It was also at the time when the music scene was becoming more adventurous with the debut albums of the Doors and Jimi Hendrix and the boundaries of music were being expanded by the Beatles and Jefferson Airplane. Although this album didn't sell in America initially, Pink Floyd's debut album has stood the test of time as not only one of the best rock albums ever released but also the crowning achievement of their original and now legendary leader Syd Barrett.<br /><br />Although this album is best known for their prelude to the space rock genre \\"Astronomy Domine\\" and the playful nursery rhymelike track \\"Bike\\", the rest of the album is just as strong as well as creative. The album's first half contains the most adventurous material as the songs \\"Lucifer Sam\\", \\"Matilda Mother\\", and \\"Flaming\\" bounce between psychedelic keyboard lines from Rick Wright and heavier arrangements, usually in the same song. \\"Pow R. Toc H.\\" and \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\" are fantastic instrumentals with the former featuring a piano solo from Wright and the latter being a 9-minute exercise in chaos which never gets boring. After these tracks, the album gets in a much folkier direction as excellent tunes like \\"The Gnome\\", \\"Chapter 24\\", and \\"Scarecrow\\" sound more like the material which Barrett would perform on his solo debut The Madcap Laughs albeit with more instrumentation. Sadly, this would be the last album where Barrett would pen most of the material as his life would soon enter a downward spiral which would lead him to leaving the music scene altogether. The band themselves would make several uneven albums after this before gaining their footing on Meddle. They would then go on to worldwide success with strong albums such as Dark Side Of The Moon and The Wall. However, the band was never as creative or as exciting as they were here. If you like their more popular material, this album may turn you off at first. But it gets better with each listen and ultimately proves to be their best release.l, this album may turn you off at first.

B0001UL7RY|4.0|There are the Avril haters, then there are the Avril lovers. I'd like to say that I was grouped into the former category...until I heard this CD. I'll give credit where credit is due; this album is much better than I expected it to be. Honestly? You don't have to like Avril the person just to like this album. You can tell that Ben Moody helps with this album, seeing as the piano piece in 'Slipped Away' is extremely similar to \\"My Immortal\\" by Evanescence. The style of songs in Avril's album sounds familiar as well. And I like it. Her first album was pretty bad because of that \\"punk\\" element, but this one's a little different. I wouldn't say it's more \\"dark\\", like Avril describes it, it's just different--less punkish style, I think. Listen to it; you might not like it, but you'll be able to tell that Avril's grown up a little.  <br />I can't pick favourite songs out of this album, as I'd probably pick the majority of the tracks as my favourites. The one that I DON'T like however, and this is the only one, is He Wasn't. Too much of that punk element. Not for me. One bad song out of twelve... the album can't be that bad.  <br />Just because I like this album, however, does not erase the fact that Avril still sucks at singing live. Ah well. Yes, I just had to do that.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|For 2003's \\"Thirteen Step\\", A Perfect Circle turned down the heavy, powerful guitars that dominated songs from their debut album such as \\"Judith\\" and \\"The Hollow\\". This time, they sound more like The Cure, and less like Tool. But don't think \\"Friday I'm In Love\\" or \\"Just Like Heaven\\" (although that would be interesting to hear)..try \\"Pornography\\" and \\"Disintegration\\" era Cure. Dark, ethereal, atmospheric, chilling, etc. There are a couple heavy moments, but most of \\"Thirteenth Step\\" is a subdued affair that may alienate some fans.    \\"The Package\\" is an epic opener that works the soft/loud dynamic perfectly in its 8 minute course, going from brooding to intense, and back again. The first single, \\"Weak and Powerless\\" churns along at an urgent pace, a deceptively catchy, extremely moody song that got more airplay than I expected.    \\"The Noose\\" is worth the price of the album alone; gorgeous and powerful, which is also an accurate description of this album as whole. Another favorite of mine is the gripping, reflective closer \\"Gravity\\", which finds light at the end of a dark tunnel with the lyrics, \\"I choose to live\\" (many people think of this album as a conceptual look through the eyes of a drug addict, and nearly all the songs make sense in that context if you listen closely). The layered guitar work and intricate 7/4 rhythm highlight this grand finale.    Fans who long for the heavier APC of \\"Judith\\" will eat up \\"The Outsider\\", an angry rant about melodrama that has an absolutely killer hook (which helped make it a popular radio single). \\"Pet\\" is another hard rocker, with lots of political references (speaking of which, APC are allegedly releasing an album of political songs this November, but I think they're just yanking our chains, which Maynard has been known to do).    The biggest surprise on the album is the band's cover of Failure's \\"The Nurse Who Loved Me\\". Whereas the original was more or less a straightforward alt rock song, APC gives it a makeover with a bizarre orchestral arrangement. Graceful, theatrical, and probably a *tad* bit sarcastic, but nonetheless, it explores new ground for the band.    Other standouts include the atmospheric \\"Vanishing\\", and \\"A Stranger\\", an accoustic ballad with sublime vocals from Maynard at the end.     I've given both \\"Mer de Noms\\" and \\"Thirteenth Step\\" a 5 star rating, which are well deserved. If I had to choose only one to listen to in the whole deserted island scenario, I'd probably pick \\"Thirteenth Step\\". It's tighter and more refined than its predecessor, both musically and lyrically. But that's a moot point, as I don't have to worry about ever being on a deserted island; thus, I can enjoy both APC masterpieces whenever I want. You should too.    Best Songs: The Noose, Gravity, The Package, Vanishing, A Stranger.

0320037819|4.0|I recommend you keep the English version close at hand.  It's easier to look up the original text than to check your dictionary.  You're likely to learn just as much that way.  I love reading these books in  other languages.  It takes me way longer, but it's fun to figure out what's being said and to chase down the sometimes inexplicable changes in translation.  It's a fun read.  It's an ok translation.  Like I said, sometimes it seems inexplicable why a phrase is turned the way it is (I swear there are at least two sentences that come off exactly the opposite of what's said in the original). <br /> <br />If you're an early Spanish reader/learner, give this book a try (Of course, start with Piedra Filosofal).  If you're an advanced Spanish speaker, you should really enjoy this.  Also, just between us, if you're an advanced Spanish reader/learner, try the Italian version, too.  Italian and Spanish are about 70% alike.  Get a dictionary (or try the method I described above) and just blaze through it. <br /> <br />It's a fun way to show your enthusiasm for the series.  It's a great way to expand your language.  The different titles on your shelves will reap nothing but awe from your friends. <br /> <br />Have fun! It's Harry Potter, after all. <br />
B000069HK2|5.0|The Used... full of memories and poetic vibes, and some screaming along the way. While Bert gazed upon the crowd, atop the amp that so taunted him, a thought might have scraped his mind. His band's album is, in short, the best of 2003. Why is this? Heart and soul. And a talent to write good songs. If you saw the Warped Tour, you would know these guys can put on a show. As for the cd, every song could become a classic, as most have already proceeded to do so. But if you want good music, hop on over to Best Buy, look in the rock section, look up The Used. Pick it up and take it to the register. Willingly, hand over the cash that is so dearly worth the album and go home. Put the cd in your stereo and turn the volume to max. Listening experiences may vary but you'll still have the best album of 2003.      <br /> <br />As Bert lies on the shoulders and hands of young ones. <br />He moves slowly towards the stage. <br />The mic is loosely gripped in his hand. <br />sweat drips from his palms. <br /> <br />Go pick up the Used!!!!!! <br />
B000002UR7|3.0|Okay, so \\"Pablo Honey\\" is an obvious anamoly in Radiohead's catalogue. It showcases a band that had yet to find an identity (it's amusing to see Thom Yorke in his early days, with his bleached blonde Cobain-like hair doo..knowing what his demeanor would become a few years later). But if you disregard all of that, and forget about the masterpieces in modern music they'd go on to make, it's pretty fun at times.  <br /> <br />Take \\"You\\", the opening cut. Even at this point, the band was screwing around with bizarre time signatures, throwing a bar of 5/8 in after three bars of 6/8, which throws the tempo off. The intro is really good. Really really good. The rest of the song is pretty cool too; it's catchy, it rocks. No complaints. <br /> <br />We all know \\"Creep\\", I'm not even gonna elaborate on it. I will say that I've never been a big fan of the song, but it's still a \\"90's modern rock\\" staple. <br /> <br />Even \\"How Do You\\", a punky little rant about someone (can't recall who) is fun because it shows a side of the band we'd never really see again. Although the band still uses a lot of subtle humor in their music, this is a different kind of 'having fun'.  <br /> <br />It slows down a little bit in the middle. \\"Stop Whispering\\" is quite plodding, IMO, and it goes on and on forever. \\"Thinking About You\\" is a boring accoustic song. \\"Ripcord\\" and \\"Vegetable\\" are also pretty forgettable, at least to me. <br /> <br />\\"Anyone Can Play Guitar\\" is a decent tune with a good hook. It has some goofy vocal mannerisms from Thom that we'd never see again. \\"Prove Yourself\\" goes from soft to haunting in verse to chorus, and is one of the better cuts on here. \\"I Can't\\" and \\"Lurgee\\" are both really good mid-tempo ballads. Finally, there's \\"Blow Out\\", the obvious standout on the album. It begins with an almost jazzy intro and first verse, then explodes into an epic of layered guitars and distortion, recalling My Bloody Valentine or Sonic Youth.  <br /> <br />I've touched on every song,as it turns out, so make your own decision here. If you want to hear Radiohead before they became the most important band in the world and before they really developed a niche (but were still able to churn out some good music), throw your bias out the window for now and give \\"Pablo Honey\\" a try. It's certainly not an essential album along the lines of \\"OK Computer\\" or \\"Kid A\\", but it's pretty good for what it is.  <br /> <br />Best Songs: Blow Out, Lurgee, You, I Can't.
B000007R1M|4.0|I believe that Kraftwerk were and are the best techno group. They were one of the first and you can tell by the lack of hip-hop influence in their music.This album is excellent. You must hear the song \\"Spacelab\\". A must buy for Kraftwerk and techno fans.
1592400876|5.0|If you've ever considered being late to work so you could go inside a shop and tell the owner his sign's all wrong, you will appreciate reading this book. Interestingly, though, the book will probably reaffirm your understanding of the rules of punctuation, rather than correct some of your errors. Those who need the book will probably not only never read it, they probably don't even know they ought to. <br />She's a very witty writer. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.  It didn't even feel as though I were \\"eating my vegetables\\" (as my husband and I call such self-improvement type books--such as How To Read a Book, or Well Educated Mind--). <br />I read it quite fast; it's enjoyable, moves quickly, and is not too thickly written. <br />It should be fairly obvious from its bestselling status that this isn't just some book.  It's clever, cunning, passionate, and alarming. Obviously, I'm all for the Oxford comma. <br />Read it so you can continue to say, \\"Gor! What simpletons! Obviously a colon is needed there and not a semicolon.\\"
B00005JL7Q|1.0|About A Boy is a bad movie. Its about this weird kid who follows a guy around because he wants his mom to like him. His mom is even more weird. She tried to comit suieside. I dont like about a boy at all. dont watch it.
B0001XAPX8|5.0|This is an outstanding movie...Hopkins, Sinese, Kidman and Ed Harris all in one movie?? What a powerful acting performance from all four.   <br /> <br />The movie has disturbing and very hopeful messages about humanity all rolled into one.  Even though it is shocking and alittle sexually graphic, it has powerful and compassionate humanistic messages subtly placed.   <br /> <br />Huge thumbs up!  Five Stars!!
B000062YB1|5.0|While most people consider Reign in Blood to be Slayer's best Album, I feel that Seasons in the Abyss is Slayer's Masterpiece.  Seasons dishes out Slayer's best Lyrics, Solos and Melodies.  There is something for every slayer fan here.  It is a combination of Reign in Blood and South of Heaven.  It's a final Chapter in The Classic Slayer Trilogy.  You want fast?  Listen to War Ensemble or Spirit in Black.  You want slow(ish)?  Listen to Dead Skin Mask, Blood Red or the title track.  Sure the production could have been just a tad bit better, but it doesn't hurt it at all, just crank up the volume some more, that always helps (even if the production is good).  I normally try not to do this, but here is a breakdown of the songs.      1. War Ensemble 10/10: I love Jeff's Solo, this song will get you hooked.    2. Blood Red 8/10: Slower but has great guitars.    3. Spirit in Black 10/10: Fast, absolutely Shreds.  Great drums from Lombardo.  4. Expendable Youth 10/10: This is one of those songs that gets stuck in your head. It's about Gang violence in America.  Only song that has a swear too.    5. Dead Skin Mask 10/10: A slow song about serial killer Ed Gein.  The man who inspired Leatherface, Norman bates and Buffalo Bill from Silence of the Lambs.  It makes you want to sway back and forth.    6. Hallowed Point 10/10: It grabs you and doesn't let go!  7. Skeletons of Society 7/10 I always thought of it as Expendable youth Part 2.    8. Temptation: 8/10 Fast, but not as good as previous tracks.    9. Born of Fire: 6/10 Don't get me wrong, this is a good song, but I hate the way Tom says \\"Born of Fire\\".  He sounds Bored, like the antichrist is retiring.  I skip it most of the time.  Good when Live though.    10. Seasons in the Abyss 10/10:  It tends to make you enter a certain state of mind or a trance.  Maybe it's the guitars, drums or Tom's lyrics...Oh Hell, it's everything!      If you're a Slayer Fan you can't pass this up, it's every bit as important as Reign in Blood.  (heck I even have it on Vinyl)  The solos Shred, the Drums go BangBangThumpCrashBangThumpThumpCrashBang multiplied by 4 squared, and the Band's Lyrics have never been better.  You can NOT PASS this up.
014028009X|3.0|I just finished reading BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY and I must say I was not that impressed. I picked up this book thinking I was going to laugh my head off but that wasn't the case. I hardly understood what she was talking about most of the time, and I get the feeling that maybe the reason I couldn't relate to the book is because I am still in my early 20's.<br />The book did have some parts that made me laugh out loud but it wasn't very often. I found myself contemplating just putting the book aside, but felt the need to finish it.<br />Bridget's mother annoyed me throughout the whole story. I can't fathom having a mother like that. Her dad was a bit of a softy, I felt that as a man he didn't claim his place, and should've spoke his mind, instead he let Pam Jones (Bridget's mom) walk all over him.<br />Bridget's friends were the highlight of this book for me, they were crazy and comical all at the same time. Overall, I rate this book as AVERAGE. Maybe the movie will bring it to life for me and make up for it.
B00005JMAH|3.0|Harry Poter and The Prisoner of Azkaban is too confusing. I never liked Harry Potter that much. It was long and very boring at times. dont watch this movie unless you love harry potter.
B0001ZX0OW|4.0|Interestingly, we are torn once again between those people who think this film is a total waste of time and money, and those who argue it is the best film ever produced.<br /><br />I am somewhere in the middle. I bought Mystic River for my husband as a gift, hoping that it would turn out to be a better version of CSI/Law and Order or any other TV cop drama/thriller. I guess it is a better version of any of those things, but it certainly has its flaws. I know everyone goes on and on about the ending, and I have to say I agree - I couldn't understand where Laura Linney's speech came from; I just felt the ending was weak and unresolved. Maybe that is what Eastwood wanted, but I fear that maybe heavy editing is to blame.<br /><br />Without a doubt, the best thing about the film is Tim Robbins. Once again, he proves his worthiness as an actor, drawing both compassion and fear from the audience as well as a sense of discomfort. Sean Penn is good, but in my opinion, not Oscar-worthy.<br /><br />It's worth watching, but maybe not worth buying. Especially this widescreen edition with no added features that still costs an arm and a leg.
0515127485|5.0|What if Stalin tried to carry a secret to his grave--but Lavrenti Beria (head of Soviet secret police and fellow homicidal maniac) got wind of it?  What if the evidence of that secret were in a notebook buried somewhere in Moscow?  Why would such a secret be so dangerous that people start ending up dead over it in post-Soviet Russia?  That's what an American historian who specializes in the Soviet Union wants to know after an old retired KGB agent pays him a visit at his Moscow hotel room.  The historian follows up some leads, acquiring an unwanted assistant in the form of an eager cable news reporter.  They end up heading north to Archangel, a city on Russia's Arctic coastline, to chase the story down.<br /><br />The adventure is a good one, with believable characters acting on believable motivations throughout the book.  I had a hard time putting it down.
B00005JLEX|5.0|Along with the famed TV shows like Star Trek, the Twilight Zone and The X files I would put Seinfeld even though this is not a science fiction TV series. The reason why it is so good is not only because it is funny, but also because it is intelligent. There is nothing more hilarious than the every-day life, and this Larry and Jerry managed to make fun of  perfectly.

B00005JNEI|5.0|In reading the minimum 1 star reviews, one has to wonder...have the terrorists really won?  Do people really think that the Bush administration's handling of this situation is the way to go?   <br /> <br />A handful of religious extremeists with box cutters, and we launch a \\"war.\\"  We are breeding terrorists, while swatting flies with the largest conventional weapons possible (see Bush's new MOB...\\"mother of all bombs\\" dropped on targets in this war). <br /> <br />Anyway...as far as the movie goes.  Of course Moore has an opinion.  He is a thinking individual.  Not a drone to this administration, which is what most of the 1 star ratings seem to be.  The movie contains a large amount of original footage, is fact rich, and presents a point of view that, for some reason, people are calling unamerican. <br /> <br />What is unamerican is NOT questioning anything and taking the role of AGGRESSOR and ALIENATING our alies.
B000001ESF|5.0|This album is the one that brought me to the Rush party. It's still one of the finest rock albums there is.<br /><br />Before 1976, Rush had released a competent but undistinguished Self-Titled Debut, with bassist/vocalist Geddy Lee (Gary Lee Weinrib), guitarist Alex Lifeson (Alex Zivojinovich, of which 'life-son' is a literal translation), and drummer John Rutsey doing a passable imitation of Led Zeppelin. Following Rutsey's amicable departure, Lee and Lifeson were joined by mad percussionist and thoughtful lyricist Neil Peart, whose influence was evident over the next two LPs (_Fly By Night_ and _Caress of Steel_). But although there was lots of good music on them, the band hadn't quite found its voice yet.<br /><br />Then came _2112_ -- without which quite a few of us would never have _heard_ of their first three albums. This one got lots of people's attention, including mine; I was introduced to it by a junior-high buddy who was as blown away by it as I was. As of this release, Rush had _arrived_.<br /><br />The title piece, as you surely know, is a twenty-minute science fiction  'rock opera' inspired largely by Ayn Rand's _Anthem_. Don't let that put you off; you don't have to have a high opinion of Rand's work in order to appreciate _2112_. (I don't think much of her as a philosopher myself, although I've enjoyed some of her non-ATLAS SHRUGGED fiction.) Peart is nobody's follower, and when it comes to Rand he knew which bits to keep and which to reject.<br /><br />Here (as in his other Rand-inspired material) he seizes on the right stuff: individualism, iconoclasm, reason, intellectual self-reliance, respect for human competence and achievement, and a deep commitment to political and social liberty. He and the band also have some things Rand didn't: the desire to rock out, and the ability to do it extremely well. (All these of guys were, and are, consummate craftsman who have consistently earned the respect of other musicians of all types. Unfortunately they didn't know, in 1976, what Rand actually thought of rock music.)<br /><br />The result is an absolutely blistering first track (originally an 'album side') and as clear-sighted a hymn to individual freedom and nonconformity as rock has ever seen.

B0001NBMBC|4.0|This is a good album. Slipknot, along with their producer, decided they wanted to do something new. That's not really a bad thing. If you want to listen to pure screaming without method or rhythm, go listen to Slipknot and Iowa. That's what almost everything on those CD's was. This proves that Slipknot actually has real talent. I picked thise up on a whim a while ago and it's fast becoming one of my favorite impulse purchases ever. Go and give it a listen at the store. Old fans seem not to like this CD, but Slipknot's winning a lot of new ones (me included) with it. It's cool, it's both heavy and light, and it's great growth for the band. Good job slipknot.
B00020HEL6|4.0|Detractors may say David Foster's music is likened to churned manufactured pop but they have to admit that Foster has an astute eye for talent. Renee Olstead is his new prodigy after the rise of stellar Josh Groban and Michael Buble - and she fills the schism between pop and jazz very well. The 15-year old exudes confidence and shines in the Gershwin's classic Summertime and switches to a vulnerable mode in the other classic Someone to Watch over Me. Olstead is positively infectious in her rendition of Taking a Chance on Love and the duet with Peter Cincotti on Breaking Up is Hard to Do gives Sedaka's classic a refreshing gloss. Olstead doesn't try hard and let her voice do the thang. Foster's new composition with Linda Thompson \\"A Love that will last\\" fortunately doesn't strive to go explosive in instrumentation and compliments Olstead's soft vocals in its perfect frothy bliss. The breezy concoction may slip your mind on first hearing but I bet you will find something that is unique and reassuring in her maiden attempt.
B00005JNJT|5.0|Either this or Sin City is going to the best summer movie of next summer. Batman Begins will probely make the most money, since the hype is up so high all ready. Let me tell you what I think of Batman's next big movie. I think the idea of making a Batman prequel is the best Warner Bros has come up with so far. Now we can go back and see him when he was all fueld up with revenge. I can't wait to see what Scarecrow is like in this. He's probley my favirte Batman villian, so it's good to see him on the big screen. Cristain Bale looks like his going to be the best Batman yet. The movie looks so cool and I can't wait to see it. I'll write an offical review when I see the movie.
0792839730|4.0|I can't help but contrast this fine film with garbage like \\"Pearl Harbor.\\" Director Richard Attenborough and screenwriter William Goldman were clearly interested in telling the story of the failed Operation Market-Garden in a manner that honors the event and the lives that were lost.  It is a serious attempt to present the context in which the battle was fought, its strategy, the human cost, and the reasons for failure.  Although there are certainly central characters, all are overshadowed by the massive scale of the conflict itself.  Characters come and go as the story requires, not because the filmmakers think they need a romantic triangle or some such contrivance to hold our attention.    This big film literally features \\"a cast of thousands.\\" Lots of big stars (ie, Sean Connery, Anthony Hopkins, Michael Caine, Robert Redford, James Caan, Gene Hackman-and that's only a partial list) play roles both big and small.  This film knows how to use movie stars; their screen presence punches up relatively underdeveloped roles and their recognizability helps us keep the large cast of characters straight in our heads.
B000001FS3|5.0|\\"The Joshua Tree\\" is truly U2's greatest album. Trust me, I've listened to them all many times. I've been obsessed with U2 since I got my first radio at age 8. At 18, my obsession is still going strong. The first four songs start the CD unbeliveably.   \\"Where the streets have no name,\\" \\"I still haven't found what I'm looking for,\\" and \\"With or without you\\" are some of U2's most popular songs, and with good reason. They are all amazing in their own way. \\"Bullet the blue sky\\" is a powerful song about the US's involvement with the Nicaraguan Contras. Depending on my mood, my favorites are \\"Running to stand still\\" and \\"In God's country.\\" \\"Trip through your wires\\" is also great. The lyrics are terse but meaningful; as they are throughout most of the album. The harmonica adds a country feel, but the song is still clearly rock and roll. \\"One tree hill\\" is more upbeat and catchy; great guitar by the Edge as always. \\"Mothers of the disappeared\\" is another politically-minded song that is enjoyable. Throughout the album, you can hear the passion in Bono's voice and in the Edge's guitar. Overall, the entire CD is incredible. If you only own one U2 CD, it should definitely be this one!
1592400876|5.0|I have laughed out loud and called all my friends to read passages from this book.  I love language and hate grammatical ignorance.  Lynne Truss knows the truth.  Grammar is important and should not be lost in the world of unGodly instant messaging and technology.  Teach your kids to write.  Heck, brush up on it yourself! This book is an absolute gem.  I will be giving it as gifts to my fellow sticklers.  And then some. Ha!
0142004235|5.0|Always reading classics for fun or school, I get really excited when I read a book as phenomenal as this one. <br /> <br />The thing that made this book stand out the most to me was what I saw as a magical aura about many of the characters. They all (Adam, Catherine, Lee, Sam Hamilton) have very exaggerated traits that bring out all sorts of facets of humanity. Innocence, evil, rash, thoughtful, acceptance, love, hate--to me, each character seemed to explore one (or more) of those. I felt like I was playing in somebody's head as he went through life. <br /> <br />Couple that with the vivid, gorgeous writing, the scenery that Steinbeck evokes of Salinas, and you've got a great book.
B000001DTM|5.0|This album may not be U2's best, but then again, the best of most bands can't even compare to U2's b-sides. \\"Achtung\\" is definitely one of U2's top 5 albums, just under \\"Joshua Tree\\" and \\"War.\\" This album has better production effects, but the old U2 is still underneath, and it comes out more clearly on some tracks than others. \\"One\\" is my favorite U2 song of all time, mostly because of the poetic lyrics and the way Bono's voice reflects the emotions of the song so well. \\"The Fly\\" is a huge departure in some ways from U2's previous albums, but The Edge's guitar riff is very powerful, as is Bono's voice. \\"Acrobat\\" is similar to the \\"Fly\\" in being a very different style, but its a change that works very well for U2 and helps them break into their more electronic '90's sound. \\"Mysterious Ways\\" is a classic. \\"Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses\\" is one of the best songs on this CD; its more stripped down than most of the others and allows Bono's voice to really soar. \\"Ultraviolet\\" is another standout. \\"Even Better than the Real Thing\\" and \\"Until the End of the World\\" are great songs as well; very catchy if not as good as some of the others. \\"Zoo Station\\" is pretty bad, and \\"So Cruel\\" is pretty bland, but overall this album is terrific. I highly recommend it to even the most casual fan.
B00007LTIC|4.0|I'm still getting into YES but this did impress me.  I'm gonna listen to it a few more times to familarize myself with thier style --- which is different even from Pink Floyd who I'm just mad about.  It's taking me some time to get used to the lyrics (I do love Andersons vocals don't get me wrong) its just there by far the most 'out there' lyrics I've seen in a while. <br /> <br />Overall it is still a very good album.
B000005J56|4.0|Let me start of by saying that once we take away Ry Cooder's guitar playing on this, we have very authentic Cuban music.  Ibrahim Ferrer, Campay Segundo, Eliades Ochoa (El Carretero is by far my favorite song), and especially Rueben Gonzalez are all fantastic musicians who make this CD.  Ry Cooder on the other hand, with his twangy 'slide' guitar is awful.  As musicians, especially ones who play in music with room for improvisation, we are taught that there is no worse crime than being insensitive to what the people you are playing with are doing.  You have to fit in with what their doing, and they have to fit with what your doing.  Cooder does not fit with the people he is playing with.  He would be well-advised to merely produce this record and lay out on ALL the tracks.  But looking past him, you find a CD that is a great intro to authentic Cuban that is a must for all CD collectors.
B00005JKES|5.0|What a fantastic programme Twin Peaks was. The series was Lynch and Frost's dark, magical lens and it made television momentarily as beautiful, compelling and disturbing as cinema. This is what television can be like and so rarely is, everyone should own a copy. <br /> <br />But there is a catch. <br /> <br />This DVD takes you halfway through the first series and there is no Season 2 DVD, nor do Artisan list one as an upcoming release. Who killed Laura Palmer? Who knows, you'd have to buy the very poor quality vhs boxset to find out.  <br /> <br />Amazon used to have a review section for Season 2 and I notice that this has also now been pulled. This is a real shame since it was one of the few public forums for venting the considerable sense of frustration that anyone who buys, and enjoys, this DVD will feel when they discover that it covers only half of the first series. <br /> <br />There is nothing, in itself, wrong with the season 1 DVD. The picture and sound quality of the re-mastering are superb, the series didn't look and sound as good when it was first aired on TV...but how can Artisan release only half the series? At the time Twin Peaks was criticised at the time for being inconclusive, unfairly since it was axed, and its (almost) amusing that the passage of time has only resulted the programme becoming even more unresolved. <br /> <br />There is an awful lot of rubbish released on DVD every week and its a pity that something as damn fine as Twin Peaks hasn't been treated with the respect it deserves. <br /> <br />It's been two years since this DVD was released...come on...let's have the second peak.

B00005S6K6|4.0|I have a certain fondness for this movie, and twenty years later, it still gets to me. I first saw this movie in a theater during a bleak Chicago winter, and the coziness of this romantic fable warmed me at the right time. Meryl Streep and Robert DeNiro - probably at the height of their respective careers in 1984 as respected, Method-style actors and bankable stars - have certainly had more challenging roles to play than the two married suburbanites here, Molly and Frank, who develop a strong attachment to one another by way of train rides back and forth  from Westchester to Manhattan. In fact, this movie does not even have the emotional gravity of Noel Coward's \\"Brief Encounter\\", which screenwriter Michael Cristopher is apparently mimicking with a mid-eighties sensibility. There are even excellent actors in supporting roles - Harvey Keitel as Frank's best friend going through his own transition, Dianne Wiest as Molly's sex-obsessed best friend, Jane Kaczmarek as Frank's content but guarded wife, David Clennon as Molly's emotionally unavailable husband - but none are given much to do, other than to be left to their own unstated thoughts and observe what's going on with the main characters.<br /><br />Yet the film has a certain pervasive charm and a subtle sense of intimacy that makes it seem more substantial than it has any right to be. There is a certain improvisational element to the two lead performances that contributes to this feeling and makes the characters easy to like despite upscale lifestyles that appear more appropriate in a Pottery Barn catalog. You do believe these two characters are hesitantly falling in love, and the scene where they try to make love for the first time has an aching honesty that deepens the story at the right moment. Leave it to Streep and DeNiro to make it all look so authentic in spite of some silly Hollywood story conventions, such as the \\"boy meets girl\\" meeting over a passel of Christmas packages at Rizzoli's or the one-year-later denouement that ends naturally on a crowded commuter train...as if there was real suspense in how the story would end.  Even putting \\"The End\\" on the screen induces an aura of Hollywood artifice.<br /><br />Regardless, the little moments are what provide the most pleasure here....the way Molly explains how she has made mu-shu pork with Aunt Jemima's pancake mix; how Frank practices his line for the \\"accidental\\" run-in with Molly; the montage of silly, Dallas/Dynasty-era outfits that Molly tries on to look good for Frank. These moments provide a nice counterbalance to the more predictable scenes of regret and guilt that are inevitable with this story. Ulu Grosbard directs the actors with a sure hand, though the pacing drags at times, especially toward the end when he suddenly tries to build some suspense with a speeding car in a downpour. Dave Grusin provides a nice, FM-lite score highlighted by \\"Mountain Dance\\", the syncopated theme that plays throughout the movie. This film is definitely recommended for those seeking Hollywood-style romance with two acting heavyweights who inject some nice realism into a slight story.ement that ends naturally on a crowded commuter train...as if there was real suspense in how the story would end.

B00013F38K|5.0|... in the foundation that introduced the western world to the eastern martial arts in a massive sweep in the early seventies. It literally set a preparation and an interest that aided in catapulting Bruce Lee's work into a phenomenon here in the states. But in contrast to Lee's raw talent and dynamic ability, the strong value that this series holds is in it's approach of portraying the teachings of the martial arts in a very moral and almost biblical way. The ideals presented within are, and were very much so in the seventies, an inspiration for strengthening and understanding one's own character and for modeling traits that could skillfully resolve conflict in a very real and usable way within oneself. David Carradine, followed by Bruce Lee, in a remarkable wake of perfect timing, created an era by being such powerful role models. Role models that defined new standards of spirituality and physical abilities that were previously unheard of, and looking back now, their achievements are really very complimentary to each other.<br /><br />David Carradine's portrayal of Kwai Chang Caine was the first enactment of any martial art that most people in the states had ever seen and, to this day, that portrayal remains among the most inspirational for it's embodiment of Eastern ideals. The realism in the sound (hitting and kicking) and the meditative (almost peaceful) lack of stress and tension in Carradine's character lends a unique emotional depth to the quality of the fight scenes. There are a lot of useful traits displayed in this show that translate wonderfully into real self awareness and improvement.<br /><br />As for this first season set of DVDs, I would highly recommend them to anyone wanting to learn anything about the drive behind learning a martial art, to fans of the series and to anyone wanting to instill humility and moral direction within themselves or their children.<br /><br />Although my preference for aspect ratio would be to keep it in full screen, for the obvious reason of not cutting out any of the image that was originally intended to be shown, the anamorphic wide screen aspect ratio does make viewing more palatable on wide screen TVs. I could foresee the likelihood that some of the original crew would want to modify the aspect ratio for wide screen viewing and film like effect if they had some overscan area to work with from the film itself. Most likely considerations for viewing on wide screen TV played a part in the decision to modify the aspect ratio. The loss of some upper and lower display is hardly an excuse to miss out on the content of the show or to miss out on reliving some early inspirations that came out of the series. The quality of the picture and sound is top notch.<br /><br />A truly inspirational series for any day and agenot cutting out any of the image that was originally intended to be shown, the anamorphic wide screen aspect ratio does make viewing more palatable on wide screen TVs.

B00005JMAH|4.0|HARRY POTTER 3 WAS ALMOST UPTO MY EXPECTATIONS. I SAY \\"ALMOST\\" BECAUSE I REALLY EXPECTED IT TO BE MUCH LONGER THAN 2 AND  HOURS. OTHERWISE, IGNORING THE TIME-FACTOR, I CONSIDER HP3 TO BE SIMPLY PERFECT, OR IN THE WORDS OF A FELLOW POTTER FAN \\"COOL, AWESOME, FANTASTIC, ROCKING\\". YES, I DID FIND IT ALL THAT. THOUGH THERE WASN'T MUCH DIFFERENCE IN THE ACTING LEVEL OF THE TRIO FROM THE FIRST 2 MOVIES (SO THE ACTING LEVEL STILL RANKS AT THE TOP), THE SETS, CLOTHES (ROBES OF THE HOGWARTS STUDENTS), AND HAIR STYLES DEFINITELY CHANGED. I THINK THE NEW DIRECTOR (ALFONSO CAURON) REALLY WANTED THEM TO LOOK MORE GROWN UP AND MATURE, AND BELIEVE ME, IT REALLY HELPED. THE GRAPHICS AND COMPUTER GENERATED MAGICAL CREATURES LIKE BUCKBEAK, SCABBERS, WEREWOLF, AND PADFOOT WERE VERY REALISTIC, SO FULL MARKS TO THE CGI TEAM. THE MARAUDER'S MAP AND HOGSMEADE VILLAGE WERE REALLY AS I HAD IMAGINED THEM TO BE LIKE, THOUGH I CONSIDERED THE MARAUDER'S MAP TO BE JUST ONE PIECE OF PARCHMENT. DAVID THEWLIS, GARY OLDMAN, MACHAEL GAMBON DID GREATLY AS LUPIN, BLACK AND DUMBLEDORE.

B00009V7T2|5.0|This album has completely blown me away.  The thing is I've actually had the album for about 10 months.  .....yeah I know. <br /> <br />I'm what people would call an audiophile.....I buy fistful of music, regardless of whether I have the time to listen to them all....or even UNWRAP THE PLASTIC off of them.... <br /> <br />........so as I take the plastic off of the cd.  I popped it in and gave it a listen.  Since then I've come away with a different outlook on what rock is, and where it's going.  This album is one of my favorites of all time (Close to OK Computer, Nevermind, and a few others).  Completely amazing.  I actually wish they were a little more self-promoting, so they would get the exposure they really deserve.  This isn't your Coldplay or Strokes or whatever \\"The....\\" band you are used to.  You will not be disappointed, believe me.
B00023BLXK|4.0|This movie was great mainly because of the sensuality. Dirty dancing-1987 wasn't really as sensual as the Spanish version. Havana nights shows the tango's style and sexuality. You have to be close with another person and experience it together. I would reccomend it to people who like Latin dance or love stories even predictable ones. Even though it's a boy meets girl story it can be pretty unpredictable at parts. This is mainly because it was an uneasy time in Cuba. 4 stars.
0792839730|5.0|This is an impressive adaptation of Cornelius Ryan's bestseller about the disastrous events that took place in September 1944, where the mission to take and hold the bridges that bordered Holland and Germany was unsuccessful, and human toll tragic, with approximately 8,000 casualties in the allied forces, and an equal number of Germans falling in battle. The script by William Goldman and direction by Richard Attenborough holds the many threads of this piece of complex history together, and makes it understandable to the viewer; so much went wrong, from the incorrect, misinterpreted or ignored intelligence, to the basic flaws in the plan.<br /><br />The introduction before the titles is fascinating, with marvelous archive footage to illustrate a narration of aspects of the war, and the planning of \\"Operation Market-Garden\\".<br /><br />The megastar cast is too numerous to mention, but standouts are Sean Connery as Major General Roy Urquart, James Caan, Michael Caine, and Edward Fox, who won 2 international awards for Supporting Actor. Maximilian Schell is excellent as a German general, and when the Nazi side of the story is told, the actors speak German, with English subtitles, adding to the realism of the film.<br /><br />The cinematography by Geoffrey Unsworth is spectacular, some of it very innovative, and with intense beauty; a rousing score by John Addison also adds a lot to the film.<br /><br />\\"A Bridge Too Far\\" was Cornelius Ryan's last big best-seller, and no cost was spared in this ambitious production, costing $ 26 million, a huge amount in 1977.<br /><br />A must see for anyone who appreciates history on film. Total running time is 176 minutes.
B000089RV6|5.0|While many newcomers to AC/DC in this day and age were probably first pulled in by \\"Highway to Hell\\" or \\"You Shook Me All Night Long,\\" it wasn't until hearing \\"Hell's Bells\\" in a pool hall that I was really pulled into AC/DC's music. The simultainously rocking and atmospheric sound of this song alone was enough to prompt me to buy BACK IN BLACK and quickly follow that with HIGHWAY TO HELL.    Though I hate to be another follower of popular opinion, I have to say that BACK IN BLACK is my favorite of AC/DC's recordings. I loved this album from begining to end from the first time, and it stands as a disc which I repeatedly come back to whenever I need a healthy dose of good times hard rock. The band is as tight as ever, with the Youngs sizzling on guitars, and the rythms of Rudd and Williams chugging underneath. Brian Johnson, while different in his delivery than Bon Scott, is still an excellent singer, bringing a solid vocal presence to the proceedings.     There are loads of perennial rock classics here, from the aforementioned \\"Hell's Bells\\" to their hit \\"You Shook Me All Night Long,\\" the title track, and \\"Shoot to Thrill.\\" Though other tracks may not have made hit status, album tracks like \\"Givin' the Dog a Bone\\" and \\"Have a Drink on Me\\" are equally excellent, and there is nothing here I would go so far as to call filler. Even my least favorite track, \\"Shake a Leg,\\" is still a great song. Throughout the album, the hooks are unforgetable, the guitars are appropriatly loud, and the rythms rock hard.    I've never heard the original masters, but this version sounds great. The sound is as crystal clear as they come, capturing every nuance of the band's playing perfectly. The digi-packs look great, but won't survive much wear and tear. The booklet provides a nice essay and pleanty of great photos.    Years later, this is still one of the best albums I've ever heard for good fun rock and roll. Its not exceptionally intellectual or sophisticated, but that was never the point anyway. BACK IN BLACK is fun as hell, and that's what makes this great. AC/DC is a great band and this is, in my opinion (and apparently that of many others) their finest ablum.  It's among the ten best selling albums of all time and, unlike some popular music, this one really earns its status. Highly reccomended.
0783226888|1.0|I learned recently that Tom Cruise and Mike Nichols had toyed with the idea of collaborating on a remake of The Heiress, with Cruise subbing for Montgomery Clift as Morris. To this end, they scheduled a viewing of said classic, sat through it, looked at each other...and ruefully concluded that with all due respect, there was no WAY they could come up with anything to compare with what they had just seen, much less better it. The project, mercifully, died in utero.    Would that Michael Caton-Jones had possessed a similar grasp of reality and lack of hubris.    Fred Zinnemann's 1973 The Day of the Jackal is on my shortlist of perfect films. The quintessential political thriller, it carries not an ounce of fat--there's not one extraneous frame or word of dialogue to mar the near-perfect visual re-creation of Frederick Forsyth's novel based on factual events in early-1960's France. Despite knowing its outcome before we even start watching, we're nevertheless on edge throughout the entire film, awed by the completely convincing cat-and-mouse game to which we're privy between two equally-matched, consummate professionals. Neither is personally involved with the task at hand--they're both just doing the jobs for which they've been hired.    This film, on the other hand, is an abomination. Instead of Charles de Gaulle, the First Lady is targeted for assassination. Edward Fox's sleek, elegant Jackal is replaced by a mugging Bruce Willis, and it would seem that Sidney Poitier (who must've needed the money) is meant to be the equivalent of Michel Lonsdale's plodding, henpecked police inspector. What this amounts to is that we're treated to a predictably 90's-style counterpoint of physical types: Willis is white, Poitier is black. The whole effect, unfortunately, comes off beige.    Myriad (gratuitous) characters are thrown into the pot, including Richard Gere as an incarcerated IRA terrorist with a bone to pick, sporting, in addition to one of the corniest Irish brogues in cinema history (right up there with Gable's Parnell), his trademark American Gigilo/Jesse Lujack swagger. I kept hoping Jerry Lee Lewis would break into \\"Breathless\\"--it would've been an improvement over the pedestrian soundtrack. In addition, we're forced to deal with--God help us--\\"character development\\" (the beauty of the original is that we're spared such contemporary \\"essentials\\" as motivation, psychology, romance, slow-motion confrontations, or even much of a soundtrack). High-tech equipment (including quasi pre-GUI computers and a rather unsubtle \\"weapon of choice,\\" which we're asked to believe is produced by someone--no doubt a savant of sorts--who probably couldn't order a hamburger at White Castle) and the obligatary shock-soaked special effects (including buckets of blood) are, presumably, meant to compensate for the woeful lack of substance.     The Spotlight Reviewer is correct about Zinnemann's wanting to disassociate himself and his masterpiece from this mess, and his insistence on the title change; he died soon afterwards with his stellar reputation intact. I was unaware that Forsyth was similarly vocal but I'm not surprised. I wish it were possible to assign a zero-star rating to this gimmicky, self-indulgent disaster, if only on the basis of its rubbing our noses in Hollywood's inability to come up with and develop new material--how many inferior remakes of classics will we continue to be forced to deal with each year?    My suggestion is to avoid this film at all cost and acquaint yourself with the original (available on Amazon for a pittance; you can't afford NOT to own it), a textbook example of how to produce a classic, despite its being given unsurprisingly pedestrian treatment on DVD by--guess which studio?--Universal. Contrast that disk with this Collector's Edition and all its extras and you're forced to wonder (alas, yet again) who's making the decisions over there and on what basis, especially considering that this film--deservedly--sunk like a stone almost immediately following its release.
B0000TB01Y|1.0|Gregory McGuire's \\"WICKED\\" is one of the best fantasy novels I have read in years.  This is a complex, political, sexual, psychological novel, so I was understandibly shocked with I heard that it was being \\"musicalized\\" by the ever unsatisfying Stephen Schwartz - then I discover the McGuire admires his work!  That's like taking your best effort and flushing it down the toilet! <br /> <br />I saw the musical - great performances (save Joel Grey \\"phoning it in\\") - great sets & costumes - and SUCH A HEADACHE by the end of the evening (and WHY did they HAVE to CHANGE the ending?) <br /> <br />Trust me the novel is GREAT FICTION (an exceptional work) - the musical is CRAP - derivative sloppy CRAP - not at all up the the standard of the book. <br /> <br />Trust me - this show lost the Tony's for good reasons! - Read the book and forget the show (although we can all count on it being on the road for years to come - go figure) - face it folks, most of Broadway is about selling tix - not the quality of the show! <br /> <br />Caveat emptor!
B00005JMJ4|5.0|As you can see by the reviews for this movie, people generally either love or hate Lost In Translation.  Either you're made for this movie or you're not, but the film is what it is.  And what it is cannot really be absorbed in one viewing.  The cinematography and story line is so dreamy and subtle that you'll almost be confused about what is happening.  But if you get to a point where you click with what is happening in this movie, you will totally love it.  If not, you'll think it's the most boring, meaningless movie ever.  Again, read the other reviews and you'll see when it clicked and when it didn't.<br /><br />What's great about this movie to me is the ability for it to take you totally out of your present situation and location and it actually makes you feel that tired/dreamy feeling you have when you're severely jet-lagged.  It is the ultimate escape movie, in that sense.  Add to that the inescapable Japanese culture at every turn, and it takes that dreamy feeling to a spacey one.  The film is full of these moments where you catch yourself saying, did he just really do that?  Did he really say that?  Whoa.<br /><br />At another level, the plot of the movie is simple and the characters are pretty deep.  Unlike most movies where they don't spend the time on character development to create the feeling that you know the character but rather rush into the action sequences (thinking about Hidalgo here) or jump into bed (too many to list), in Lost In Translation, you really get to know Bob and Charlotte.  And the moments that they experience are many of the same moments we all experience at one time or another, but the setting is so dreamy that you admire them for how they conduct themselves.  There is some honor here that is missing in almost everything anymore.<br /><br />I loved it.  But you have to be in the right state of mind, ready to take a trip of exploring a dreamy, jet-lagged, emotional relationship that is what we used to call a friendship.  It's just so different than most stuff out there today.  And watch it a second time, there's so much there.ust so different than most stuff out there today.  And watch it a second time, there's so much there.
0767836286|4.0|This film won't keep you guessing, but it will keep you watching. And thats a nice quality to have in the terrorism genre. Tim Robbins turns in an engaging performance and always manages to keep a small part of me on his side- no matter how evil it may be. Jeff Bridges and his character's girlfriend were a little lacking, but Robbins and the ever-fabulous Joan Cusack more than made up for it. The kids in this movie were good too- exuding a strange \\"Children of the Corn\\" feel despite their limited screen time.<br /><br />Its a timely film as well in this era of fear and terrorism- pertaining more to the una-bomber and Oklahoma City and such internal militia groups or activists, than foreign attackers such as in the World Trade Center.<br /><br />I found it to be generally well rounded and acted. The cinematic style was appealing, and the story engaging. I loved the use of light in the scenes, and the mis-en-scene it could create. Also, the colors of the costumes and the use of metal and decor spoke to me on a different level than the script. Each detail was telling you some additional information. Its a more character driven story in my opinion, but the climax and typical twist are satisfying, and the end is intelligent and thought provoking.<br /><br />I had heard negative reviews of this piece before I saw it, but I must say I was more than pleasantly surprised.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Whether you are on the far right (Republican) or the far left  (Democrat); or even if you have no political affiliation at all, this film, contrary to the criticisms, presents an opportunity for the viewer to evaluate well presented facts. Moore is clearly a brilliant director whose biting sarcasm helps to add a touch of humour to otherwise serious and thought-provoking issues pre and post 9/11.
B000274THQ|4.0|Its in German and has English subtitles.<br /><br />Ok, now that I've instantly cut my audience down to the people who will probably dig this film, I will begin.<br /><br />Wolfgang Becker has lovingly crafted this portrait of East/West Germany during it's time of political upheaval through the story of one boy's love for his mother. Having never seen a story of Germany through the rose tinted glasses of an idealist socialist, this was a learning experience for me. Through the film, Alex (played by Daniel Bruhl who you will just fall in love with by the end) rewrites East Germany's history for his mother in an effort to steel her from any shocks to her heart after she awakens from an 8 month coma during which the Wall fell, and capitalism invaded the East. As Alex says in the film, he ends up portraying East Germany as how he wishes it was, rather than how it had been. This story shows the effects and consequences of change in Germany through the eyes of her people. Cosmonauts, experimental art, drugs, Spreewald Pickles, and waiting three years for a car... There is a particulalry poignant scene when the family's savings is rendered worthless due to the currency change...<br /><br />All in all, a good story, and a fine film.
0684857219|5.0|I began bodybuilding about a year ago and this was the first book I bought on the subject. Wow! Most books I have seen since then only offer a sliver of information compared to what is contained here.<br /><br />Almost every exercise that one can perform on every muscle group shown, but the proper technique is also given. It is difficult to accurately describe how to do something (try to write a decription on how to tie your shows and you'll see what I mean), but the descriptions here are dead on. It also goes in to detail about correcting weaknesses, how to \\"cheat\\", and variations for better working muscles for your body type.<br /><br />Further, the books talks about the history of bodybuilding, how to prepare for a competition, proper nutrition, supplements and overall body maintenance. Even if you are not a competitive bodybuilder (like me) this book will give you all the information you need to properly work out with weights and to build muscle.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to everyone who wants to get into shape. It has been an invaluable reference for me and I consult it regularly. Also, despite what one reviewer wrote, it does list exercise routines. But - as the book says - one must continuously change one's routine, lest the muscles adapt to the training and don't grow. Changing the stresses on a muscle periodically challenge the muscle fibers and allow growth to continue.<br /><br />Again, for the price (I paid $25 for this book), it is a great deal. Buy it - read it - and learn from it. It will be a small investment that you will truly benefit from.
0735619670|5.0|If you are a programmer, no matter what your level of expertise is, this book is a must. As a 35 year-old college student in my third year of a computer science degree, I must say that I firmly believe this book will take me further in the programming world than all my academic learning will. I read elsewhere how this book should be required reading for college students entering the workforce. after having purchased this book I must say they were right.
B0000033P0|5.0|Tarkus was the first ELP album I owned back in the early '70s.  I've been a fan of ELP ever since.  Pretentious, saber rattling, aggressive rock-n-roll.  ELP was at the forefront of progressive rock, blending classical, jazz and rock in a frantic keyboard driven fusion. ELP's music is more complex than any other rock band I am aware of. ELP was not only complex in the scope of the music, but often used complex 5/4 and 7/4 time signatures, which only jazz great Dave Brubeck and classical composers would dare use. They are as dark as Pink Floyd could ever be and just a touch more complex and grand in scope than the best work by Yes. And they manage to make this amazing music, which at times has the scope and feel of a whole symphony, with only three musicians and without any overdubs.<br /><br />The 20 minute Tarkus suite, which takes up side one of the vinyl LP, would best be described in '70s vernacular as \\"mind blowing!\\"  An anti-war masterpiece, it starts with an organ note, which makes an almost human cry, \\"Ahhhhhhhh....\\"  The note gets progressively louder until it breaks into an oddly metered march punctuated by Palmer's metronome like drumb strikes.  Thereafter, the piece alternates between discordant marches and Greg Lake's melancholy lyrics:<br /><br />\\"Clear the battlefield and let me see<br />All the profit from our victory.<br />You talk of freedom, starving children fall.<br />Are you deaf when you hear the season's call? ...\\"<br /><br />The suite finishes off with \\"Aquatarkus,\\" an instrumental piece which sounds like the militaristic state left after the war, where life is almost normal, but the war machine is ever present.<br /><br />Some have dismissed side two of the vinyl as being no more worthy than the \\"B\\" side of a 45 rpm single.  OK, it has the 1950s throwback \\"Are You Ready Eddy?,\\" written about their recoding engineer, and the goofy honky tonk \\"Jeremy Bender.\\"  Personally I feel these \\"lesser\\" songs are almost necessary to lighten up the album.  Side two is not devoid of iconoclastic music and contains the mini-suite consisting of \\"The Only Way (Hymn)/Infinite Space (Conclusion)/A Time and a Place.\\"  Here, ELP question the existence of a diety and man's place in the universe by including lyrics such as \\"Do you believe God makes you breathe?  Why did he lose six million Jews?\\"<br /><br />There is little which is easy listening about this album.  It isn't a collection of dance songs, and it is not background music.  It is made to be listened to, digested and listened to again.  It demands input from the listener.  A great album.<br /><br />I also recommend you purchase the DVD-Audio version of Brain Salad Surgery as it sounds really great.sic and contains the mini-suite consisting of \\"The Only Way (Hymn)/Infinite Space (Conclusion)/A Time and a Place.\\"  Here, ELP question the existence of a diety and man's place in the universe by including lyrics such as \\"Do you believe God makes you breathe?

B000099T2L|3.0|Beyonce' could have done better. This is a good CD for right now, but it's not the CD you would put in the CD player 10 years from now and still like it. The producers really modernized the music on this CD, and that takes away from the quality. The CD is about love, for the most part. Beyonce' really can sing, and she needs no technology to enhance her voice. The CD is equipped with the right amount of songs, both fast and slow. She collaborates a lot on this CD.<br /><br />\\"Crazy in Love\\" by far, the CD's biggest release, is the duet with Jay-Z. The catchy chorus stays in the minds of listeners for days and the rap from Jay-Z makes the song all the more cool. The song was undoubtably the biggest hit of the summer of 2003, some even agree that it was the biggest song of 2003. Beyonce' duets with Luther Vandross to re-make \\"The Closer I Get to You\\". They did a beautiful job, to say the least. Their voices blended so well. \\"Speechless\\" is the song about the way Beyonce' feels when she is making love to with her man. I've talked to a lot of people who like this song. Poeple seem to favor the part when Beyonce' chants \\"Yes\\" over and over again. \\"Speechless\\" is a very mellow song, one that could be played when attemping to seduce someone. :). I really don't care for the way Beyonce' put Dangerously in Love\\" on her CD when she first made the same song with Destiny's Child. It sounds the same aside from a few instrumental differences. It's a nice song. \\"Daddy\\" is the heartfelt song she dedicates to her father, Mathew Knowles. This is a very beautiful song. Beyonce' says she wants her unborn son and husband to be like her daddy.<br /><br />Beyonce' has a decent album, but it's not a classic. Her Destiny's Child music will beat this CD any day. 3 Stars.<br /><br />MIKEISHA'S TOP 5<br />1. Speechless<br />2. Me, Myself and I<br />3. Daddy<br />4. Crazy in Love<br />5. The Closer I Get to You

You know something is up when they come across those skinned bodies hanging upside down in those trees and Billy the indian knows something but doesn't want to spook everyone.I especailly love how they wait to show the predator building the suspense and finaly when everybody but arnold is disposed of it is time to get down to biness. It's a battle between the best earth has to offer versus the best the universe has to offer in an all out battle to the death that will go down in movie history not only as arnold's best movie but as the best sci-fi action movie ever!

B000003TA4|5.0|I don't understand how you could not like this cd.  I've been reading the bad reviews for this cd to see the reviewers reasons for not liking it.  The fact is, their reasons are all crap.  They claim that Cobain was a no brain, no talent loser.  This is totally off.  To fully understand his talent, you have to listen to what he's saying in his songs, as well as enjoying the beautiful guitar and bass work.  This is the best cd that you could buy if you want to know the original rock that others tried to copy for the past decade.
0446530891|1.0|This book holds your attention for a little longer than a split second; say 5 minutes.  That's time enough for what could have been a promising political thriller to devolve into a thuddingly dull revenge caper/laughable romance tale.  And the ending!  Straight out of the \\"Mad?  I'm not mad!  It's the world that's mad! Muwahahah!\\" school of TV-movie villany. As with most later Baldacci novels, the dialogue and character interaction are painfully forced and cliched to boot.  Skip this one unless you're truly addicted to the author's work, and even then you may be tempted to enter a 12-step program afterwards.
B000069KGM|4.0|Chicago is one of the best alternate rock bands ever to grace the vast and exciting ocean of rock'n'roll. Their musical style, a blend of rock, classical, and jazz is... of course unique, but its also very energetic. This, the bands first album is good...really good, though its not quite as good as there second album. The best songs on this album are, \\"I'm a Man\\", \\" South California Purples\\", and \\"Liberation\\". Buy it, listen to it all, then buy Chicago II. <br />
B00028HBKM|5.0|Full of amazing production and all kinds of acting.  But it is so well researched and based on true accounts, it is a relief that someone had the fortitude to finally make it real.<br /><br />I love Jesus the Christ personally, and all the history we have of him is wonderful.  But this movie drove it home that he became a man, and went through a lot to make our life better.  I have such a understanding of that now.<br /><br />Thanks Mel for your hard work.  Nay-sayers have never bothered you, and you are to be commended for your hard work here.  Please make more Bible movies.  Noah's Flood.  Creation.  And PLEASE make a 10 commandments that we can stand to watch again!
B00018D44U|4.0|When I first heard it, I found it to be just a little too country, especially the song \\"Creepin In\\", I still can't stand that song, but other than that one, I love this album, all the songs are good, when a musician changes his or her sound on their album, there are those who will like it, there are those who think it is ok but they liked the other one better and those that absolutely hate it, it is inevitable, I like it a lot, so yeah, it's a gamble. Enjoy
0312958455|5.0|Michael Connelly is fast becoming the pre-eminent Mystery/Crime novelist and rightly so. Having read all his books I can't think of anyone who I've enjoyed more consistently. Whether his main character is the endearing Detective Hieronymous (Harry)Bosch, Retired FBI profiler Terry McCaleb, FBI agent Rachael Walling or none of the above, I've enjoyed every story, all fourteen of them.<br /><br />Of course my favorite main character has to be the intractable Detective Bosch, offspring of a call girl whose murder in 1961 left young Harry orphaned at the age of twelve. The Last Coyote, Connelly's fourth novel, sees Bosch, placed on indefinite leave for putting his Lieutenant's head through a plate glass window and taking advantage of his new found free time to reopen the aged cold case of his mother's murder.<br /><br />Everybody or Nobody<br /><br />As far as Harry is concerned, everybody, no matter what their station in life, gets equal treatment under the law. That's why his personal motto is \\"Everybody or Nobody\\" and he lives by that creed. Is that a coincidence, I think not. It probably goes back to his childhood and his mother's unsolved murder.<br /><br />Harry's Mother's name was Marjorie Lowe. After receiving a card five years previously from Marjorie's best friend, Merideth Roman, Harry pulled the murder file to try to reopen the case but he wasn't yet ready emotionally. So now he decided to try again. He had plenty of time between the three weekly visits to Carmen Hinojos, the departments anger management consultant (shrink), so he decided to give it another go. This time Harry got far enough into the murder book to decide that as he suspected, the investigation was whitewashed and some V.I.P.s were involved. Harry discovers Marjorie was seeing Arlo Conklin a former DA. Also possibly involved was Gordan Mittel, Conklin's former aid and now political kingmaker.<br /><br />Harry has plenty of time but he has no authority and no gun, so when he starts nosing around it disturbs some people. He is still angry at Harvey Pounds, his lieutenant and he needs a badge so he steals Pound's, on the sly. He also throws Pounds name around and this turns out to be a mistake, as it ends badly.<br /><br />Harry's an endearing character but he's certainly not delicate. Sometimes his investigating style is like a bull in a china shop. He gets results but some dishes get broken. In this case Harry's investigation leads to a couple more murders and almost Harry's demise. But let me tell you, I found the ending to be most surprising, even the second time around. If you can guess the ending before he gives it to you in the last fifteen or so pages, you're a better sleuth than me and I'm pretty good.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />Bosch is a complex character who doesn't even seem to know himself. On one hand he is a resolutely honorable human being while being both difficult and uncompromising. This dichotomy is not appreciated among his superiors but because he is a extremely competent at his job, they cut him some slack. I think he is so popular a character because many of his readers identify with him in his travails against both bad guys, unfairness and bureaucracies.<br /><br />Author Michael Connelly is/was a crime reporter for the LA Times for years, which seems to give him a special insight into the world of crime and crime fighters, which is evident in his books. Having been a writer before an author also gives him a concise, economical, smooth writing style that is user friendly, which this reader appreciates. I just finished reading this book for the second time - actually the first time was an audio book - and I'm still amazed how Connelly can jerk the reader around, in a good sense, continuously making the reader guess the wrong bad guy and the wrong outcome.

B00008OWZC|4.0|It was the early 70's, a carload of us went to a concert in at the Baltimore Civic Center... these guys were rockin', This album brought back memories... I cranked it up.... but somehow it just didn't measure up to what my minds eye recalled. It was a great show, the Fourth album was out and I bet they did just about everything from all four albums. LZ opened with the Immigrant song and I believe they might have closed or encored with Moby Dick or Bring it on home. There was also a nice acoustic set in the middle.

B00000DWHH|5.0|I'm sure my following statement will be the subject of some disagreement but it is my opinion, so here goes.<br /><br />The Who's, Who's Next is not only the greatest Who album, it is the greatest rock & roll album of all time, Mr D. has spoken! What, you don't agree? If not The Who's, Who's next, Who then, eh Who? Oh sure there is a plethora of classic rock & roll albums, many of which are worthy runnerups. Led Zepplin, Boston, The Beatles, Styx, BTO, The Doors, Mob Rules... Mob Rules? Forget that one.<br /><br />Anyway, there have been numerous great R & R albums over the years but in my opinion from the urinique album cover to the fabulous music, from Baba O'Riley (which many people think is entitled Teenage Wasteland) to Won't Get Fooled Again, this is the best most thoroughly original non filler album around and I'm not a big Who fan.<br /><br />That said here is some information to digest about this most fabulous album of all time. Who's Next was released in 1971 and it was a smash for a rock and roll album topping as the years number four best selling album and with two, not that radio friendly, singles, Won't Get Fooled Again No. 15 and Behind Blue Eyes No. 34 cracking the years top forty.<br /><br />Strange thing is that much of Who's Next was written by Pete Townshend to be a new rock opera called Lifehouse. This project, Lifehouse, was abandoned when Townshend suffered a nervous breakdown and continued as Who's Next after his recovery and what an album it is. This album is blessed with not one or two but three brilliant, acknowledged rock classics, Baba O'Riley, Behind Blue Eyes and Won't Get Fooled Again. These song are so good that they, by their presence, unfairly diminish the remaining six exceptional numbers.<br /><br />Though you may not agree with my contention that this is the greatest R&R album of all time, I doubt many would argue it's inclusion in a top ten list.<br /><br />Townshed's genius is evident throughout and his recent affinity for and inclusion of synthesizers in Who's Next recording process added an element that was missing previously, weaving a texture within and amplifying the emotional essence of this magnificent recording.<br /><br />Who's Next is is The Who's crowning achievement. It is an emotive rollercoaster containing all the emotions within the climate of the times, angst, sorrow, regret, rage, pain and passion wrapped into a neat little package.<br /><br />While some point to the artsy Tommy or Quadrophenia as The paragon of the portfolio, I feel it is just that...art, while Who's Next is true rock and roll.t affinity for and inclusion of synthesizers in Who's Next recording process added an element that was missing previously, weaving a texture within and amplifying the emotional essence of this magnificent recording.  <br /> <br />Who's Next is is The Who's crowning achievement.

B00005JMAH|5.0|I never considered reading the Potter books, that is, until I watched this movie.  Some have said it would be confusing to those who weren't familiar with the series' plots.  Some said it was too dark.  I actually felt the second movie, not the third, was confusing, and I appreciate the darkness in the movies.  The whimsy of the first books fades into darker and more complex plots as the series goes on, but the books only get better.  I was quite comfortable with the movie's version of the plot and didn't feel at all confused.  Since then, I read the series and although there were certainly plot differences, this book was also over 100 pages longer than its predecessors so obviously, some things had to be cut.  I don't envy the screenwriter, but I loved the movie before and after I read the book.  I think he captured the essence of the book, and that's all you can ask for.  Can't wait to see what they do with the fourth book, regardless of who directs the film. I'd like to see this guy come back.  (I was however surprised in the cinematic changes in the sets--Hagrid's hut and the position of the Whomping Willow, etc--but who cares?! The cast and plot is great!)
B000006YYM|5.0|Believe it or not, yes, there *was* a title track for this album. In typically perverse Gentle Giant style that track was omitted from the orignal release. However it was restored with the 1992 Terrapin Trucking re-issue of this album (TRUCK CD 002 - [5-027569-000222]). It's a pity EMI didn't follow their lead. <br /> <br />Regardless, this record is *essential* but find the Terrapin release if you can.
0684857219|5.0|If there is a negative write up about this book, then that person did not read it well. When people think of bodybuilding they really do think of huge 260 pound men grunting and groaning in a room, but  Arnold changes the view on that and believe me when I say, it is now more keen to go to the gym that waste time doing waste-of-time things. One distinctive attribute of the book is that you can definately detect Arnol's personality in the writings which are very informative. Reading through a few pages alone answers questions upon questions that have been wondering in your mind and are now confirmed. It is indeed a huge satisfaction to read on and find out more and more the things I need to know and not even get to the heart of the book as yet. Now I know that most people may think this is a book for the competitive bodybuilder alone, WRONG!, the book is for everyone from the business man or woman wanting to keep in shape, atheletes who are looking for complete body performance to the competitive body builder. As I read on more and more, I quickly realized that the road to your health and sporting success is the same straight road to a competitive bodybuilder; and that based on your personal objectives you may just choose to stop at being in good muscular health or continue to a more athletic typed development or keep going to competitive bodybuilding; so you see, this book is the ultimate, because it does not dwell on opinions but rather hard facts. Furthertoabove, believe me, I was skeptical about purchasing this book but decided to say : \\"you know what, boy take the dive and buy the book, if you loose the money you loose the money,\\" and that was not the case. BUY THE DAMN BOOK! <br /> <br />Curtis K. Davis
B00009UW0N|5.0|What I like about this film is that you are scared throughout the whole thing. When you think that crazy (...) Michael Myers will attack he never does. He attacks right when you least expect he will (like the car sequence) and when he does you either A. S**t your pants, B. Scream, C. Jump out of your seat, or D. All of the above. What I really like about this movie though is that Michael Myers is this force that nobody can stop even if you shoot him six times in the chest or set him on fire. But they should really kill him off now since the sequels are really starting to suck. If you love, like or just think the Halloween series is okay then buy this masterpiece. I would rank it up with \\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\" (original 1974 version) and the original \\"Psycho\\" and its way better than that \\"Friday the 13th\\" or \\"Nightmare on Elmstreet\\" (...). This is a classic you can't afford not to have.
B00005JMAH|5.0|The Harry Potter franchise has done it again. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is excellent and worth every ounce of your money and time.     Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the most poetic out of the Harry Potter films with its dark and icy overtones and constant camera flow, which makes the viewers feel Harry is constantly stalked. In the third installment, Sirius Black, a noted murderer and a supporter of Lord Voldemort, has escaped from the wizard prison, Azkaban, and is now said to be after Harry Potter.     Now for this movie, Alfonso Cuaron must be praised for his brilliant direction and his creativity. Viewers will note the small changes to Hogwarts and its grounds, but first and foremost, this film is a lot darker than the first two but it's also a piece of artwork. It's full of beauty and grace that a true movie should be. The acting is excellent (most noted is Daniel Radcliffe who plays Harry Potter. His acting has improved immensely from the first two. Gary Oldman is perfect as Sirius Black; David Thewlis is terrific as Remus Lupin) and the cinematography is beautiful.     Every scene with Buckbeak the hippogriff is unbelievable. The CGI work on Buckbeak has got to be one of the best in movie history, every detail is shown and has got to be CGI at it's finest.  The special effects are brilliant beyond comprehension. Most notable are the Dementors, which in their own interity are creepy and scary enough to chill viewers to their bones. Every scene with the Dementors is chilling and they are the perfect translation to what JK Rowling wrote them as in the book.     The film like the book incorporates a lot of humor and adolescent initiations, but the movie, like all film-book adaptations, is perhaps not the most faithful, cuts out a lot of the explaining, which can annoy staunch Harry Potter fans; however, it does help the movie move faster.     The movie is excellent and is a visual feast that will make you grip the edge of your seat for life. Alfonso Cuaron has captured perfectly the book's essence and spirit and viewers will feel like they are soaring as the movie draws to an end wanting more and wishing for the next installment to come sooner.
B000002AH9|5.0|This is one of the greatest lp's Ever!, while Billie's voice was not at it's peak the emotional depths she reaches is what made this lp a classic! 'Lady in Satin' cannot be classified as a 'Jazz record' because it's not, this is a true Pop record with those incredible Ray Ellis arrangements, after listening to this lp many times I understood why so many artists say this was her best! and this lp has one of the most striking photos of Billie.
B00005NWM3|2.0|Nickelback does write about things that I can relate to like family problems and abuse but....this music sounds like crap.Its the type of rock thats so unoriginal and makes you cringe.Its like biting into a stale chip.
B00006JDVV|1.0|Without wasting much time (about 1 minute to be precise) with unnecessary trivialities such as a background about the advent of flying dragons, this noisy post-apocalyptic snore has a near-future London tormented by giant mythic smoke-snorting beasts laying waste to humanity.<br /><br />We are led to believe that all of them are female, except for that one omnipotent male dragon who single-handely supports the entire beastly race. To be fair, the Jurassic-like fire breathers are well crafted but appear mostly disingenuous through all that soot and noise in the murky night light, which is pretty much the tone of the entire movie. Quick action takes and camera swivels are employed to evoke a frantic Hollywood action mode, but they only add to your migraine.<br /><br />And if there's anything more stupid than these caricature animals, it's the army that's pulled together to fight them. Our smart humans have discovered a complicated system of dragon fighting that has substantially advanced beyond the time-honoured techniques of a brave heart and a well-aimed sceptre between the beast's shoulder blades. The new strategy involves the best aspects of trick flying, skydiving and dodge ball.<br /><br />If you're still with me, well done, but Reign of Fire marks the worst variety of over-the-top drivel produced in Hollywood. The lint on my old shirts has higher IQ.
0385336810|5.0|THIS BOOK IS GREAT...it has a great storyline throughout the entire book and never has a dull moment.  i enjoyed the characters as well.  Kinsella does a great job closing it all together in the end.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|I've been waiting for this wonderful show to come out on DVD. Great acting and writing combine to create heartwarming stories about life in a small town.  Watch an episode and you'll be hooked too!
B000002UA0|5.0|This is psychidelia at its best. If you expect to hear the Pink Floyd that did Wish You Were Here and Another Brick in the Wall, you better not even bother. With Syd Barret as singer/guitarist instead of Dave Gilmour they sound like a completely different band. Although Syd only made it through this album (their first) and one song on their next album, he left a lasting impression on the world of rock and future songwriting generations to come. In this album he paints wild abstract pictures of space, fantasy, philosophy, and more general acid madness. The rest of the band performs beautifully as well, Nick Mason playing unlike any other drummer at the time, Richard Wright adding texture with his organ, and Roger Waters doing some really terrific harmonies with Barret (Astronomy Domine, Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk) and solid bass. <br /> <br />Now to the music. The music on this album is great. Astronomy Domine is a great opener and very well arranged - there are a lot of subtle sound effects that really add to the experience. It is probably my favorite Pink Floyd song- there is a truly amazing version on the live album of Ummagumma. Another big big gem in this album is the massive instrumental Interstellar Overdrive, which sits massively right in the center of this album. It (and the entire album in general) incorporates a lot of panning effects, which makes it quite interesting to listen to on headphones. It, along with Roger Waters' first songwriting effort, Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk, are the two amazing jam songs of this album. To tell you the truth, every song on this album is good, my least favorite is probably Flaming, which doesnt sound quite as tight as the rest of the songs. Other than that, there is a great mix of jazz (Pow R. Toc H.), almost midevil sounding music (Scarecrow, Matilda Mother), and a great fun little ditty (The Gnome). Its one of those albums that is just packed with different styles, all maintaining that psychidelic feeling, however. <br /> <br />This album is not only a landmark of Pink Floyd, but it is a landmark of the 60's and of Psychidelic rock.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I think all the songs are awesome... I have never boughten a slipknot cd before, just heard them, and I am glad I bought this one. It was worth it, my overall favourite songs are &quot;Duality&quot; and &quot;Before I forget&quot; <BR>However, I was disappointed that there is only 14 songs on this cd, hopefully the next cd I buy will have more songs.<BR>Overall I recommend this to a slipknot fan, or someone who has not heard them before, you won't believe what you have been missing!
B000002LVB|3.0|This album, to be best described, is some killer, most filler. The best by far are Who Loves the Sun and Oh! Sweet Nuthin. Sweet Jane, Rock and Roll, and New Age are all great songs, but there are better versions, whether they are live or (in the case of Sweet Jane) Lou Reed versions. The rest of the songs are pretty lame, not very exciting to listen to, and the lyrics are mostly generic or just pointless (Lonesome Cowboy Bill).  <br /> <br />Listening to this, I wondered, where is the band that busted out Sister Ray, Beginning to See the Light, and so many other great Velvet classics? It can't be Doug Yule... although Lou claimed that he ruined Sweet Jane, all of the live bootlegs leading up to this era are great! Perhaps it was because this was their most publicized album. Before this, they were pretty unknown, and, obviously, the audience did not affect their performance. I don't think we'll ever know. <br /> <br />The good songs on this album, however, are terrific. Who Loves the Sun is just a great, feel-good song, and Oh! Sweet Nuthin has to be one of the greatest closers ever (Both were in the film High Fidelity, just a quick random fact). The other song I like is Train Round the Bend, which has a kind of White Light/White Heat feel to it. Throw in the bad versions of some good songs, and then some general crappy songs that arent worth talking about, and you have this album. <br /> <br />Buy it if you are a completist, but if not, I recommend just finding the live versions of the good songs, they are much better and actually worth paying money for.
B00005JKWJ|5.0|The action in this movie really is non-stop. An outstanding action sequence opens the movie, and there's an even better one for the finale. It's violence and gore to the max, probably enough to fill several movies, but it fits the movie. It's about vampires, so what can you expect? Blood, of course. And the new vampire elites have this special mouth opening trick that can be really disgusting to some people. However I thought it was awesome. There isn't really much plot to speak of. Blade's former enemies need him to lead their \\"Blood Pack\\" to battle the new vampire elites that have began an uprising. The movie mostly focuses on action, and it does amazing things with it. CG effects are weaved into some of the sequences, and it only makes them look cooler than they already are. I specifically liked the CG effects in the finale of the movie. As for acting, Wesley Snipes returns as Blade, along with Kris Kristofferson as Whistler. Newcomers are Ron Perlman as Reinhardt, and Leonor Varela as Nyssa. <br /> <br />The New Line Platinum Series DVD edition really is amazing. The Audio and Video quality are both outstanding, and there are a large handful of extras. They include an 83-minute documentary on the film, 25 minutes of deleted scenes, some excerpts from the director's notebook, an art gallery, a \\"Cypress Hill\\" music video, visual effects documentaries, the theatrical teaser and trailer, and DVD-ROM features. This is a must for any DVD collector.
B00006BTCA|2.0|On it's own it's a good album, the recording is clean and the songwriting/musicianship is good.  <br /> <br />But... every time I listen, I end up stopping it after a minute or two and put on some Joy Division. It's not that I think in any way that Interpol are trying to sound like JD, it's just my honest reaction. I guess it's not a bad thing per se, but I think it suggests something when I'd rather listen to the bands these guys emulate than their own recording.  <br /> <br />Post-Punk is a great sound and Interpol does a good job of recording in that style. But they aren't doing anything that wasn't done 20 years ago. They haven't added anything new or exciting to the genre.  <br /> <br />If you're new to this style of music, I highly recommend you try Joy Division, Echo & the Bunneymen, Kitchens of Distinction, The Fall, Public Image Limited, The Cure, Crispy Ambulance, Section 25, Gang of Four, & Magazine first. Then listen in Interpol and you'll better understand my position. Obviously there are many options and it's useful to know the history of a style to better appreciate current offerings.  <br /> <br />Again, Interpol does a good job, but it's just a variation of what was going on 20 years ago. I really wished they could have put something together that built on the Post-Punk sound instead of just repeating it. <br />
B000001Y79|5.0|This is what I call music. And it appeals to all sorts of music lovers. I mean, if you like rock, ska, pop, whatever, you'll like No Doubt. It truly has something for everyone. As a true No Doubt fan, I love all of their albums, but as cliche as it is, I think this one is their best. I like how the songs range from the up beat \\"I'm Just a Girl\\" to the slower ballad \\"Don't Speak.\\" And even if you don't like No Doubt in general, you'll like this CD. My older brother who loves metal music like the group Slayer, likes this CD. This truly is The Ultimate Album.<br /><br />If you like this CD, I recommend: Try the band Save Ferris.
B0002TT0NW|5.0|This movie ROCKED!!!!!!!!! There were not as many one liners in this film which I missed (its one of the charming things about the other two movies), but the film as a whole is very good. Gambon is a great Dumbledore (although I miss Richard Harris alot)! I think %99.9 of the HP fans out there will give it their stamp of approval.
0385512104|5.0|I have been reading a lot of books lately - some of which that have been disappointing. I was hesitant to start this book because I wasn't sure if it would disappoint as well. Luckily it didn't, and I finished it within a week - maybe 3 - 4 days?? <br /> <br />Anyway, this book is a very interesting insight into the mind of an autistic person. The book made me question who has the better advantage in life - people with autism or people without? With autism, Christopher was a very matter-of-fact teen that had logical explanations for the things that ran smoothly in his life. When he was upset, he would calm himself down by doing math problems in his head. His parents, on the other hand, were emotional and angered easily for unlogical reasons (at least to Christopher). At times when he should have been afraid he wasn't, and at times when he should have felt safe he was afraid - an example of this is when he was talking to the old neighbor lady who was giving him lemonade and cookies. He was very afraid because she was a stranger to him although a neighbor. <br /> <br />It is a very straightforward book, and a refreshing read. I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves to read high-quality literature.
B0002IU988|5.0|i gave this cd 5 stars for one reason.....because it will more than likely be read by more people than if i gave it 1 star.  seriously, it should get zero stars.  do any of you people know anything about music?  first off, lets get the whole creed mention out of the way.  creed wasn't any good and this band sounds damn near the exact same...for good reason though obviously.  if it looks like creed, smells like creed, and sounds like creed...thsn it probably is crap.  anyone who claimed that this band contains great guitar work is quite out of touch with guitar playing.  it is extremely average at best.  anyone who thinks this contains any songs that could even be slightly considered \\"metal\\" (which have been mentioned in other reviews) well, those people probably consider good charlotte as \\"punk\\".  lol  seriously people, if you are a creed fan..then buy the cd up and go rock out at church.  everyone else who likes real good music with great songwriting, great lyrics, and great guitarwork...steer way clear of this one.  unless of course you need something to put your drink on and want to pay that much.  5 stars minus 5 stars equals alter bridge.  enough said.
B000002H1T|5.0|Here it is, the big commercial smash, the one that actually bums some Cars fans out because of the big pop hits to be found left and right. But Heartbeat City continued the band tradition of keeping the pop and art elements perfectly in sync. With this release, however, the Cars revved up the already cruising 340 horsepower heart of their sound. A good example of staying with the arty side of things is the first track, the quirky 'Hello Again'. The sound is a little slicker this time (with Def Leppard and Bryan Adams producer John \\"Mutt\\" Lange co-producing the album, that's bound to happen. I mean check out the intro of this tune; it actually sounds kinda like Def Leppard's layered vocal sound). But this song still could only be a Cars creation. I still haven't seen the Andy Warhol-directed video for this one, but I can't wait to. Has to be interesting. That's followed by the cool tones of 'Looking For Love'. Always loved the sound of the \\"you can't stop, but you can't go on\\" refrain; I can't explain it, but I find it catchier than even the chorus. After that comes 'Magic', one of the big hits of the album. I've always loved this song; great harmonies, perfect singalong chorus. Who could forget the video for it, with Ric Ocasek walking on the water of a swimming pool? Who knew Jesus Christ had spikey hair and was in a rock band? Next comes the band's most popular ballad, the incredible 'Drive'. I'll bet even people who don't like the Cars or '80s music love this song. It's unforgettable and proof positive why Ric Ocasek is one of rock's most underrated writers and Benjamin Orr's best and much-missed singers. The absolute highlight of the Heartbeat City album, if not the highlight of the Cars' career. Then there's the great 'Stranger Eyes'. Coulda been yet another single, and it features more of Orr's great vocals. 'You Might Think' is also a memorable hit; I've always loved this one, long before I ever bought my first Cars album. It just makes me smile every time and remains one of my favorite Cars songs. 'It's Not The Night' is an undiscovered gem for radio. Absolutely wonderful song, with a pretty melody that Ocasek and the Cars' resident wizard Greg Hawkes is responsible for. 'Why Can't I Have You' is a wonderful song I've loved ever since I first heard it on The Cars Complete Greatest Hits collection. Another tune about a dreamy, mysterious and possibly lethal woman of Ric's dreams. Why don't more people write songs like this? After that is 'I Refuse' which yet again could've made a good single. This whole album is alot like the Cars' debut; catchy songs all over the place. The last song, 'Heartbeat City' is a wonderful, dark song that I never tire of listening to. This one made the 1985 Greatest Hits collection, but sadly was ommited from the aformentioned Complete Greatest Hits collection. Ah well, it's still one of the band's greatest title tracks.  <br />So there you have it, the band's greatest commercial album and possibly their best album period, tied with their debut and Panorama. They would never be this good again, signing off after 1987's Door To Door. But the good times never rolled better than this.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Drawing from the old Kung Fu movies and even some anime, Tarantino wows us with this revenge movie, centered on The Bride, played by Uma Thurman. She was shot down by her former colleagues, an assassins' squad headed by David Carradine (Bill) on her wedding day, and while very pregnant. Four years later, she wakes up with a taste for vengeance. <br /> <br />The cinematography is outstanding, the acting even better. The references to the old movies of this genre are just a treat. Even Uma's yellow jumpsuit is vintage Bruce Lee, and the fight scenes are amazing.  <br /> <br />Only Tarantino could have pulled this off. Awesome, awesome, awesome. I bought this movie the second it was available for purchase.
B00006CXXU|5.0|\\"Stripped\\" is a really great album, and a must-have for any CD collection. X-Tina really shows off her superb vocal range, especially in \\"The Voice Within\\"  <br /> <br />The songs range from the jazzy \\"Walk Away\\" to the Latin-styled \\"Infatuation\\". A personal favourite is the hip-hop style of \\"Dirrty\\", the first single from the CD. <br /> <br />I'd definately recommend this CD to everyone!
B0001AVZA8|3.0|When you see that Jack Nicholson is in a film, you pretty much expect it to be good, because he is that good. You expect someone that has been around as long as Diane Keaton to be good, but she was on the edge of annoying.  <br /> <br />In summary, Jack Nicholson and his girlfriend (Amanda Peet) are set to spend a weekend at her mother's summer house. He is a lifelong bachelor with a thing for much younger women. After a heart attack that sidelines him, a reluctant romance blossoms between him and Diane Keaton, who plays Amanda Peet's mother. She is stuffy and wears a lot of turtlenecks, and without saying a whole lot more to give it away, this predictable and lighthearted comedy-romance is severely flawed by several factors. <br /> <br />Keanu Reeves playing a doctor. While he did not ruin the part in playing it, and actually turned out a solid performance on his part, he is not terribly believable, and his character's obssession with Diane Keaton could not be believable if a really great actor played him. In this case, it was not his fault, but the fault of the person that wrote the story. <br /> <br />Diane Keaton may have been cute when she was younger and overacting, but now, it's just annoying. I never realized how silly she was as an actress until I saw this movie, and she was a huge disappointment. She makes faces, gets hysterical, and her drawn out crying jag isn't funny, it makes a person want to grab her by the hair and smack her.  <br /> <br />The movie has its moments. There are a few hysterical scenes in it, but ultimately, the movie was drawn out for far too long, and the ending was just silly to me, as well as unrealistic. Mind you, when I say that, I don't mean the end result, but how it comes about. Silly. <br /> <br />It's a nice \\"once see\\". Jack Nicholson is a god and he is always worth watching. I wouldn't watch it a second time.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Ok, I've never actually been a Britney fan. I've never bought one of her other CD's. But theres something about this CD that I really like! <br />  <br /> For a start, all of the songs make sense. Theres no silly lyrics like \\"Hit me baby... one more time\\". Instead, the lyrics seem to be based more on personal experiences. <br /> <br /> My favorite song of the album would have to be \\"Toxic\\". It's a really cool, edgy song, and it makes you wanna get up and dance!!  <br />Another favourite would be the heart-felt \\"Everytime\\". This, also, is a great song! <br /> <br />If your a fan of either Hilary Duff or Christina Aguilera, then you'll probably really like this CD. If you're more a rock person - then stay away!
B0001Z52RU|4.0|Ashton Kutcher finally shows himself worthy.  I love him in \\"That 70s Show\\", and I even like \\"Pun'kd\\" once in a while, in which he shows off his flair for playing both an idiot and a prankster. Until \\"The Butterfly Effect\\", I believed that this was all he was capable of. This movie shows that this young man may not be Lawrence Olivier, but he is an able actor that will go far with his talent rather than with his choice of bedmate. <br /> <br />That said, \\"The Butterfly Effect\\" is a movie that explores the idea of Chaos Theory, and how one little thing, such as the flap of a butterfly wing, can change one's fate entirely. Ashton's character is cursed with the power to change his fate, and the fate of his childhood friends. Amy Smart goes from suicidal waitress to frat girl to drug addled hooker with ease in each of these fates, and Eric Stoltz plays the child molesting daddy with eerie precision. Every performance in this movie is strong, and nothing is sacred for the film maker. We get prison rape scenes, child abuse, animal abuse, and a host of other horrible things thrown at us that other films would avoid for fear of horrifying an audience into missing the point of the actual story. <br /> <br />So why a 4 instead of a 5? Despite there being two endings, a theater version and the director's cut, the former being much better, there was a better option for the end of this movie. The option where he goes to the original reality and deals with it like anyone else might be forced to do, regardless of the consequences.
B00005V3Z4|4.0|'Donnie Darko' was brilliant. And you know what? I can't exactly say why. Maybe that is the wonder of this film: there is so much room for interpretation. Its own complexity only underscores one of its themes. What are these themes, you ask? There are many, and I went through a sort of cycle to understand what the film was trying to say: <br /> <br />First I thought it was a film conveying the decay of modern society through metaphor. Then I thought it was about the complexities of fear, and that those who try to pin down life problems too simply are lost in themselves because they choose not to face the truth that lies within the shadows. Lastly, I began to think it was simply a movie that wanted to say, \\"There are those who may be able to control fate with time travel, but only a few. They are out there; and it is possible.\\"  <br /> <br />Honestly, to me, it was all three rolled into one genius cult flick.  <br /> <br />I'm a big fan of films that attempt to tackle so much, because 1) it makes me think and approach aspects of my own psyche and 2) it offers more interesting cinema than the normalcy of peaceful narrative. It's even better when the film manages to pull off every one of its goals, especially with engaging symbolism and beautifully crafted twists and turns. I can't even say I caught everything by the end of 'Darko.' But I understood everything I needed to understand. I believe that was what director Richard Kelly was attempting overall: to offer us a film that can be stretched so many ways that you can't help but make it personal.
B00005JMUA|5.0|This installment moves more slowly than the first. While there is plenty of violence and again, pretty cool fight scenes and some really cool cinematography, the whole story finally gets told through present time crisis and flashbacks.  <br /> <br />I enjoyed this as much, if not more, than the first, which is a rare quality in any sequel. This homage to the old Kung Fu genre is a well acted, visually aesthetic film that cannot be missed if you liked the first one.
B00005JMEW|1.0|I guess I would be more merciful and give this movie a 2 (or even 3 star rating, if I was in a good mood), but the utter disappointment I felt after watching it and Volume 2 was so powerful that I feel compelled to rate it even lower. <br /> <br />\\"Kill Bill\\" is not a good movie.  The acting is atrocious and the story is stupid.  Then again, Kill Bill was not recommended to me on the basis of its story or acting---it was hyped-up because of its action scenes, its direction, and its humor.  And none of these three things are particularly great. <br /> <br />Firstly, the direction.  Okay, so, Tarantino did a couple of quirky things, but they didn't lend themselves to the movie very well.  Switching from color to black and white in the middle of a fight might be a very good way to direct a scene if it achieved some purpose---but instead, it's just something for people to point at and go, \\"Look!  It's DIFFERENT!\\"  The movie is full of little experimental things like that which are cool in their own way, but don't actually make the movie any better. <br /> <br />Then we have the humor.  Pretty much all of the humor in the movie is supposed to come from one of two sources:  either over-the-top gore that is meant to be hilarious, or over-the-top shocks.  The shocking moments are neither shocking or funny, such as when The Bride wakes up to find out she's been prostituted by her orderly.  It's not shocking because the acting and pacing of the scenes are miserable, and it isn't funny because there isn't actually any joke about.  Tarantino assumes that shocking material is inherently funny, but it isn't.  You need to actually set up a joke and have a punchline in order to make people laugh. <br /> <br />The over-the-top gore is actually a great disappointment.  Go see the movie \\"Bad Taste\\" and then you'll see what I mean.  Bad Taste is full of cartoony, over-the-top violence that is funny because it is extremely unrealistic.  The gore works in that movie because it is consistent and the tone is right.  In Kill Bill, the tone is consistently boring.  The gore doesn't seem funny in the context---it just seems stupid. <br /> <br />Finally, we come to the action scenes.  These are the greatest disappointment out of everything in the movie.  There are basically two big action scenes in the movie---the fight with Lucy Liu/her henchmen and the fight with Vivica A. Fox.  The latter barely lasts a minute and a half and is so poorly shot that it fails to be exciting.  The former stretches slightly past five minutes, but because there is absolutely no suspense (Of COURSE The Bride will live---we know that there's another movie coming up), the fight is incredibly dull. <br /> <br />What you really have here is a piece of randomly assorted scenes that \\"pay tribute\\" to terrible movies from the seventies.  People hail this as the final great mark of genius in the movie, but unless you have seen every bad movie from the seventies, it really doesn't mean anything.  I could make a movie that pays tribute to a bunch of math textbooks from the fifties, but unless you are a hardcore math professor with a lot of time on your hands, you probably wouldn't like my movie.  Why should any of us non-trendy, uneducated types really care about Kill Bill when we are unfamiliar with the source material? <br /> <br />This is a terrible movie.  Do not see it.  Do not buy into the hype.  If you want to see something that's full of crazy gore and ridiculous humor, but that's actually GOOD, then check out any of Peter Jackson's early movies.
B0001ZX0PG|5.0|Who could have imagined Sean Penn, our Spicolli from Ridgemont High, turning out a performance that is reminiscent of DeNiro? So like DeNiro he is, that I kept forgetting that I was watching Sean Penn. Everyone in this film deserves the props for outstanding performances. Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon complete Penn's circle of friends that were, as one reviewer put it, torn apart by childhood tragedy and brought together by it years later.  <br /> <br />Here lies a tale of death, vengeance, and vigilante justice gone wrong. This is a dark and disturbing movie that leaves you feeling icky for days afterward.  <br /> <br />Eastwood has created a masterpiece with this one which is infinitely watchable, and undeniably moving.
B00007ELEL|4.0|The characters hold this movie together! Walter, The Lebowski clan, his assistant, Bunnie, Jesus, Maude & her friend, the German nihilists, the LAPD, etc. <br /> <br />John Goodman is OVER THE TOP. <br /> <br />Also a great rendition of Viva Las Vegas by Sheryl Crow. <br /> <br />What a ride. <br /> <br />
B0002IU988|3.0|There's one large difference between Creed and Alter Bridge. And it's not just the fact that Scott Stapp has now gotten a higher voice, lost his alcoholic habits and become someone by the name of Myles Kennedy. I'm talking about the overall vibe that I get when I listen to the music. <br /> <br />When you listen to Creed's music, it was darker, gloomier and overall had more of a crunch to it. Alter Bridge's lyrics are a lot more uplifting and with their new singer belting it out, it really kind of lost that 'dark edge' I enjoyed with Creed. If I had to put it into clearer wording, the music just sounds more 'shallow' than Creed's work. <br /> <br />So, is it bad? No. Actually, it's pretty good. The guitar licks and solos are amazing as expected. Maybe it's just too light-hearted to suit my tastes perfectly. But overall, it's not a decent outing. Hopefully they remain together for a long time, they're a good group who will grow even greater as they mature even further.
6304708491|5.0|The least critically acclaimed but my favorite of the Beatles movies, Help is just... fun! Trippy enough to be entertaining, but not pretentious, it'll have you alternately laughing and singing along for an hour and a half. The movie, of course, has a fantastic soundtrack, and the Fab Four perform in very creative locations (particularly cute is when they go sledding as they sing \\"Ticket to Ride\\"). The story is perhaps a bit politically incorrect now, but they manage to parody an Eastern cult without getting too racist. Little touches in the movie are the best part, with lots of quotables (\\"A thingie! A fiendish thingie!\\"- George Harrison), and scenes that are just adorable (possibly since they were still a little innocent and not too doped up when they made it), like when Paul plays a girl like she's a guitar. It's not deep like their later work (think \\"You've Got to Hide Your Love Away,\\" not \\"Eleanor Rigby\\"), but it succeeds in what it sets out to create, which is a fun, entertaining movie.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|A Perfect Circle is the side-project of Tool's frontman Maynard James Keenan, and those who are die-hard fans of Tool might be turned off by this newest LP.  At the same time, however, most fans won't be able to fully appreciate the humor and subtle undertones that exist within this music without knowing more about Maynard's style.  Although Maynard is usually associated with A Perfect Circle, the true brains behind the band is an ex-guitar tech for such bands as Tool, Nine Inch Nails, and Smashing Pumpkins, his name is Billy Howerdel and he's also the lead guitar of the band.  \\"Thirteenth Step\\" is a huge step from the first album \\"Mer de Noms\\" and is much more mellow and mature.  Those who appreciate the entire first album \\"Mer de Noms\\" will no doubt appreciate \\"Thirteenth Step.\\"  The biggest negatively reviewed item of the LP is the song entitled 'The Nurse who Loved Me,' which doesn't seem to fit into the record, but fans of Tool and Maynard will not be surprised by this semi-a cappella song that doesn't seem to fit.  Billy Howerdel's song writing, and Maynard James Keenan's singing is top notch and anything they do together will set the mold for many musical acts to come.
0385335482|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars because it's such a fun book.  I didn't know what to expect when I brought it home, but it's an easy, light read and I have to tell you I laughed out loud so much that my husband asked me many times what was so funny.  I'm a UK citizen and have lived in the US since I was 7, so I got all the english jokes and words used in the books......I can't wait until Shopaholic and Sister comes out over here.....Give it a try, I don't think you'll be disappointed--honest.

B0001Z52RU|1.0|He can go back in time and change events, which changes the lives of his circle of friends, and family.  Not very profound . . . obviously, changing the past will change the future.  But for the Butterfly Effect to be true to its name, many other things would change too, which doesn't happen.  The film is \\"politically correct\\" covering a rainbow of situations . . . in having lead characters in prison, dead, happily married, as a paraplegic, as students, in a mental ward, with incurable cancer, in a porno movie, a drug-crazed hooker, and so on.  What's left out?  This is a simple minded film which makes very little sense and it would be better to have passed it by.
B0001Z52RU|4.0|This is a great film, but there's no release at the end of it.  Of all the endings they shot, the Happy Sappy was actually the best.  However, even that one seems rushed and imperfect.  They should have ended up with everything fixed and not even having to wait 8 years for the two leads to hook up.  The writer/directors saying that the film simply wasn't heading in that direction and it wouldn't be right to end it happily is nonsense.  The characters and the audience have just been through hell.  There is absolutely no way that Kutcher's character would put up with a life without her, or his own nonexistence, for that matter.  O.k., he was gang raped in one reality and an amputee in another, but it was his love for her that motivated him to keep trying.  Since they wrote the Director's Cut Ending in the original script, the writer/directors obviously thought his love for her was enough to warrant killing himself.  But come on, if there are an infinite number of possible outcomes, then there's no point in stopping until it's all satisfactory.  The downer endings might look good on paper, but they play like arse on screen.  Of the two versions included on the DVD, the Theatrical Version is the better one, not because it's less depressing (though it is), but simply because it's more consistent with his character and the journey he's made...and hey, that missed-look is classic.  His mother also looks too young in the Fortune Teller Scene.  I thought they could possibly start making out at any moment.  The drastic solution in the other ending strikes me as rash and desperate, as if he is losing his grip.  If someone told me about it or I'd read the original script, I'd probably call it as a great idea.  But it simply doesn't feel right in practice.  Don't think I hate unhappy endings.  If the catharsis has built up to that point, tragedy is artistically beautiful.  In this case the film did not warrant a downer ending...of any sort.  The fact that they shot so many endings in the first place is a symptom that the writer/directors had lost their pulse on the film's emotional development towards the end.  If the climax/resolution is not completely and obviously right how you imagine it, then you're probably way off.  Great endings don't have \\"alternatives\\".  I might rip the DVD into Final Cut Pro and put the Happy Sappy on the end and burn it onto a DVD-R.  O.k., it's a little corney and rushed, but it's better than the others shot.  That film will be just barely a 5 star film.gs in the first place is a symptom that the writer/directors had lost their pulse on the film's emotional development towards the end.

0786915749|2.0|Like the other books following the original Dragonlance series and the \\"War of the Twins\\" books, this disappoints. Why do Weis and Hickman think a world without magic will interest fantasy fans? We get that in real life. The inglorious endings of beloved characters are extremely unsatisfying. One must wonder if the authors are simply tired of writing this series.
B00005JMUA|3.0|There were too many times in this movie when I expected something to happen and nothing did.  It's not about the lack of action necessarilly (although there is that to consider as well), but about the scenes that didn't seem to have any purpose or bearing on the film.  The example of Bud getting yelled at by his boss at the local dive.  I kept expecting him to kill the guy or to come back and shoot the place up but nothing ever happens.  Seemed like a waste of film.  It would have been just as easy to show how poor off he was without dragging the scene out like this.  There were a few of these types of scenes thoughout.  There were also some really dumb parts that I didn't find very funny or entertaining, but they were so silly Tarrentino must have intended it to be so.  Bill shoots a truth serum into the \\"Bride\\" and its just hokey.  The wedding scene would have benefited from some editing to cut down the length of it.  The entire ending was built up and then you get let down when once again not much happens.  It's very short and lackluster.  They could have taken the time used to film the usless wedding scene and the boss-yelling-at-Bud scene and added a good ending to it all.  Honestly with a few minor changes the film would have been sooooo much better.  Not to sound like I hated it but it could have been better.  3 stars is prefectly on the mark I would say.  It DOES have some really awsome scenes in it, like the texas burial, the Brides training flash back (I laughed and laughed).  Rent it first and then purchase it if you like it.
B000063COX|3.0|Ok, lets face it, this is good, but embrionic Maiden, Paul is good but Iron Maiden became great with Bruce
B00006JDSI|4.0|Out of the two reasonable options, I purchased the Kino version of \\"Nosferatu\\" over that of Image Entertainment.  There is much to enjoy in the film, of course, which is the basis of my rating; such can not be said of the accompanying music.  Two soundtracks are provided: 1) a mediocre synthesizer effort by Sosin, which stupidly incorporates some annoying, occasionally comical, sound effects; and 2) a worthless track of noise masquerading as music, wholely contemptible.  I've wondered if I made the wrong choice.  A couple of reviewers have suggested that the music on the IE version is even worse.  I find that hard to believe, but if so, there must be a conspiracy at work.  Interestingly, I own a CD of glorious music composed-- by the late, great James Bernard-- specifically for this film.  I wonder why his score was not an option on either version?
0226264211|5.0|Milton Friedman is one fo the strongest proponents of freedom in society as the only way towards development (a concept later expanded by Amartya Sen).  This book is not an economics textbook, since he does not spend much time on the basic concepts of economics such as price theory.  He assumes a bit of knowledge and uses it to make the case for many different economic ideas ranging from macroeconomics (monetarism) to microeconomics (school vouchers).<br /><br />For a book that was written in the 60s, it is amazing how current his ideas remain.  It is perhaps the most important book on the libertarian philosophy, focusing on preventing the accumulation of power by any individual or group of individuals in society.<br /><br />Overall, it is a great read for someone familiar with economics and social sciences, it will definitely expand your horizons of thought.  However, if you are looking for an introduction to interesting eocnomic ideas, I would suggest you read Free to Choose, which Friedman wrote a dozen years later to reach a more general audience.
B00018D44U|5.0|I admit I'm not a genre person, so I didn't weigh this album against any standard of how it's supposed to sound. It's just great..relaxing, soothing music. I like it alot!!!!!! <br /> <br />
B00026YO36|5.0|I bought this album two days ago and have been listening to it non-stop. Of all of his albums, this is by far the most consistent and rewarding (with all of his previous work I would love about half of the songs and was left unmoved by the other half). Here I'd be hard-pressed to disparage any of the 15 tunes. <br /> <br />While it's true it's not as acoustic as his previous few albums, there are still a number of haunting, quiet tunes as well as a few rockers, which have pretty been non-existent on his previous work (and the change of pace is welcome). There's also a lot more subtle experimenting with the sound and the production; in some cases it even reminds me of Tom Waits' \\"Bone Machine\\". Indeed, with his voice, Lanegan almost reminds of a more talented, and wearier Jim Morrison singing like Tom Waits, a voice full of whiskey, cigarette and regrets. <br /> <br />I almost never give five star ratings (I think they're used far too often) but in this case I believe it's deserved. A strong contender for album of the year.
B000088E6D|5.0|I am seriously at a loss for words to describe how great Michael is and how wonderful this album is.  I immediately fell in love with the voice and the album.  BUY IT NOW!  YOU SIMPLY MUST HAVE THIS ALBUM.  Great for any mood or occasion as background music or to set a mood.
B00006HAZG|4.0|I watched Part I with my 8 year old daughter.  She absolutely loved it and so did I.  It was so visual and captivating that she watched the whole 90 minutes in one go, even though she originally had said that she was only going to watch 30 minutes of it.  I hope she will read the book in due time.  I saw Part II by myself (I didn't let my daughter see it because I think she is too young to relate to it much).  I think Part II was also very good although a bit choppier than the Part I (eg. the wickedness of Heep was not very fully developed).  Overall though I still enjoyed the movie.
B0001Z53AQ|3.0|<br />     When I heard the \\"My Band\\" single on the radio it was one of my favorite rap songs until they overplayed it and made too big of a deal out of it, and then it slowly slipped off my top 10 list. Eminem's voice sounded screwed up on that song and the rest of the groups verses didn't sound as good as some others on the album. But other songs like \\"How Come\\" and \\"40 Oz\\" help make this album more listenable. But seriously, I expected more from the people who made Devil's Night, which is much better than this. If you must buy a D12 album, stick with Devil's Night. If you're a hardcore fan this should be a hit with you.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|I was first introduced to Muse by their song \\"Time is Running Out\\", which was awesome. They have an explosive sound, and have something that is needed in today's hip-hop dominated world. People continously compare them to Radiohead, which bugs me since it gives people the impression that they are just copycats. <br /> <br />All the rock I have listened to lately has sounded like the same mass produced garbage that has been circulating these past two years or so. Muse is by no means unorignal, except to those who are in so much love with Radiohead that they want to make them sound importantby saying that Muse is stealing their sound. <br /> <br />Muse is great, listen to them because they are bringing to the planet that which hip-hop and new prissy rock bands aren't, good music.
B0001UL7RY|2.0|Does anybody else remember the interviews and press on Avril Lavigne (back when they were still trying to convince everybody she was \\"punk\\") in which she promised us that her next CD was going to have \\"loud guitars, like Nirvana?\\"  I'm paraphrasing because I didn't want to waste my time finding the particular article I read.  However, one listen to either of her radio singles will tell you that she has not changed a bit since her first CD.  It is still plain, radio-friendly, teeny-bop angst pop that The Matrix probably wrote for her in their sleep.  I still don't know how an artist this mediocre could have gotten so popular, and I guess the only answer is an ad campaign costing probable millions to convince defiant tween-age girls that Avril is hip, talented, and \\"punk,\\" which, by its brand new oxymoronic main-stream definition is gaining in popularity among those just hitting puberty and experiencing hormonal imbalances and pms for the first time. <br />While her catchy pop melodies may be pleasing to the ears for the first couple seconds, it will get old fast.  Trust me.  I used to own her first CD, but after the second or third listen I could no longer tolerate the cookie-cutter formulation of the songs or the childish lyrics.  Don't bother buying this CD unless you are a twelve year old teeny bopper girl who doesn't mind atrociously cliche'd pop-\\"punk\\" music along the lines of simple plan, good charlotte, and blink 182.  Actually, Avril's music is mostly pop, with very few instances of distorted guitars or even medium-fast tempos.  Oh well, she lied to us.  To think that at first I thought she had so much potential for excellence. Before I listened to her, that is.
B00005R2M3|1.0|I'm sorry--not offence to Latinos--but this music is bad, and if it weren't for her Pamela Anderson-esque looks, then Shikira would not be where she is. In other words, if she looked like the back of a filthy truck, then nobody would've given her the time of day.  <br /> <br />This is soulless, meaningless, trippy drivel, and the fact that she dyed her hair blonde from brown to appeal more to Americans just goes to show how bad the music industry in this country really is alone. I weep for the future.  <br /> <br />
B000001EMW|3.0|some of the metal purists will no doubt hate the idea of a tribute band/album such as this...but give it a shot. i have to admit that i love the cello but am not the biggest fan of metallica (lots of great childhood memories associated with their early cassettes but i haven't actively sought to buy them on cd as of this point in time). so basically i bought this cd by Apocalyptica based on the fact that it's an interesting novelty item. but...by the ghost of cliff burton, there is actually some great music that merits worth! these four cello players work up a frenzy of metallica songs and get away with it brilliantly! there's alot of bare tension and drama illustrated within these pieces that sort of gets shuffled aside for raw electric fury of the originals. i find the centerpoint of the album (The Unforgive, Sad But True, and Creeping Death) to contain the best playing. a really nice and interesting disc which may not be 100% suitable for the diehard metallica fan, but certainly for a music fan with an open ear and an open mind.
B000002P74|5.0|Southern rock legend Lynyrd Skynyrd's second album in 1974 including their most well-known song \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\" is a nice dumpy swampy and occasionally pop and catchy 70's masterpiece. It could be the second album to get after listening to their greatest hits.<br /><br />I do love Sweet Home Alabama but this song does not well present me how they rock as I have heard from lots of hard rock fans who appreciate this band. I am really glad that I finally have this. Yep, I NEED YOU exactly fit the image of their rock. Deep south blues flavored rock. DON'T ASK ME NO QUESTION is excellently made pop song and THE BALLAD OF CURTIS LOEW really touches me. THE NEEDLE AND THE SPOON is a light mannered anti-drug song. CALL ME THE BREEZE nicely wraps us this album. Boy it could be one of the finest we could get before Synth music dominates the music scene. Their sincere rock style is fresh for us.<br /><br />Paradise for southern rock appreciators and it still catches huge music fans for sure.
B0000517BU|4.0|amon duul II is most def. the better of the two amon duul bands and this landmark 1970 album cements that status. this is often looked at as their best album (this and Phallus Dei) and once the cd kicks off...it's not hard to understand why. the 4 songs that make up the miniature rock epic \\"soap shop rock\\" starts it up and at almost 16 minutes, it will keep you interested to hear more. the fuzzy bass...the rocking distorted guitar, the strange male and female vocals, the druggy noisy interludes....it's all here. i notice alot of Amon Duul II's influence on modern 'stoner rock' ands like Fu Manchu or Clutch; esp. on songs like \\"Archangels Thunderbird.\\" isn't that a great title?
B00005YUPO|5.0|Our Dr. said at 5 weeks our daughter could be interested in these videos...and she was right.  Now she is 15 mos. and still loves this video as much as ever.  We've tried other videos, but the BABY Einstein videos are by far her favorite!
0399146253|4.0|Endless law enforcement personnel are invading the home of Kay Scarpetta, Chief Medical Examiner of Virginia, when THE LAST PRECINCT opens just a few short hours from where the previous novel ended.  Dr. Scarpetta is back from the hospital, wearing a cast. She is valiantly trying to pack a suitcase, embarrassed by the presence of her friend and fellow investigator, Capt. Pete Marino.  She is packing because the police have asked her to leave, an event that launches Kay on a journey unlike any she has ever experienced.<br /><br />Eleventh in author Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta series, THE LAST PRECINCT captured me immediately and never let up, thrilling me with 450 pages of sharp and gritty Cornwell style.<br /><br />Without spilling the beans, readers will be drawn into these key plot elements:  Kay is betrayed.  Marino's vulnerability is shown.  Lucy is hiding something.  And Kay investigates Diane Bray's murder with Jaime Berger, a New York prosecuting attorney.  But Berger thinks Kay might be the killer.<br /><br />Guaranteed to keep you up all night and write these characters upon your heart forever.
B00005JMUA|5.0|KILL BILL VOL 2<br /><br />Kill Bill Vol. 2 continues the trail of revenge killings by Uma Thurman's character- The Bride- whose name is finally revealed. Both Vol. 1 and 2 were originally intended and filmed to be one movie. The benefits of this are similar to those in \\"The Lord of Rings\\" trilogy in that there is a real sense of continuity in the scenes and cinematography that might have been absent if this was filmed years later as a sequel.<br /><br />Once again Tarantino pulls no punches. There are references and tips of the hat to the seveneties, martial arts movies and a dozen TV themes. This is a feast for moviegoers.<br /><br />If you didn't see Vol. 1 you will be at a disadvantage although there is a small recap at the beginning. Vol. 2 does tone the violence down in favor of more dialogue, especially in the final scenes between John Carradine's character and The Bride.<br /><br />Darryl Hannah plays California Mountain Snake to perfection as a diabolical homicidal one-eyed killer who turns on her own kind. Also great is Michael Madsen as the loner/loser Budd aka Sidewinder who almost comes across as a sympathetic everyday loser as he waits for his fate. Not to be missed is the chilling chapter 'The Lonely Grave of Paula Schultz' where Uma Thurman is buried alive and must reach back into past to survive.<br /><br />Packed with pop culture references, martial arts violence and cinematic flourish Kill Bill Vol. 2 is a great finish to one of the best film stories of the decade and quiet possible, of the last fifty years. Highly recommended.
B00020HEL6|5.0|Shame on you, amazon, for not immediately emailing everyone who has ever ordered female vocals, lounge, soul, blues, jazz vocals, Costes, Verve...about this CD.  I walked in to the jazz section of Virgin Records megastore in Times Square and heard this CD playing.  I thought I knew all the female jazz vocalists but this one was new and I HAD to know who.  I stayed there and listened to the whole thing in awe.  Renee Olstead's delivery of \\"Is you is or is you ain't my baby\\" may be this song's most perfect form.  She honors her composers and her predecessors because her performance elevates their work.  Her rich and perfectly tuned voice is astonishing in its complexity, resonance, fluidity and precision.  And she knows her stuff--she has clearly studied the history of the music she sings and she draws from the masters, perfecting what they started.  I find myself asking aloud \\"how'd you DO that, girl?  Dang! That's nice!\\"  This VERY  young lady is giving the world a beautiful gift.  LISTEN UP!  You too will say \\"Thank you, thank you, thank you!\\"  The whole CD is great, but extra stars for \\"Is you is...,\\" \\"Midnight at the Oasis,\\" and \\"Sentimental Journey.\\"  I sure don't skip any songs, but I DO replay \\"Is you is...\\" again and again.  That is just one extra-fine piece of work!
0790729628|5.0|One of the BEST sci-fi movies ever....and the stupid director thinks he knows better than everyone...<br />Give us the ORIGINAL version back !!!<br />I LOVED the voice-over...I LOVED the original ending !!!<br />Give us a choice at least. Don't you think a DVD has enough room on it to give us both versions, or are you waiting for everyone to buy this one first, then soak us again farther down the road..like Lord Of The Rings did?<br /><br />Update:  Just bought Blu-Ray 5 disc set.....Wow!!! Did someone actually listen to their public finally???<br />  A great movie is now a Great Blu-Ray.  All 350 versions of the movie included, plus hours of extras, all for a very reasonable price.<br />  Excellent !!!!!!!!!!
0399103422|5.0|The films stuck to the most important parts of this novel, however, Puzo provides more backstory for some of his characters with motivations being clearer.  The side stories of Johnny Fontane, Jules, Lucy Mancini, et al, are rich and add detail to the overall work.  This is an engrossing novel, even if the female characters are relegated to minor roles.
B000089RVX|1.0|OK, while i dont mean to be offensive, the americans dont really do gothic music properly. Its all too industrial and cheesy which is why i prefer Nightwish, Lacuna Coil and Arch Enemy ( A really good European death metal band with a woman singer). Ok, so Evanescence do have some good songs but i mean, they sound like linkin park which i hate. Please, the band is just bad and amy can shove her bring me to life song chorus up her a** because id rather bring her to death!
B000000H3Z|5.0|Beneath The Remains is definetely my favorite Sepultura album. No ballads, no romance whatsoever. Just pure raw, violent, aggresive music that you can listen to while getting your daily rush of adrenaline. This album has got some insane vocals from frontman/rhythm guitarist Max Cavelera, just listen to him on the title track. The guitarwork from Max and lead guitarist Andreas Kisser is just raw and gut busting. Igor Cavelera (Max's brother) is one of the best drummers I've ever heard, the guy is just phenomenal with the double bass, and his snare blasts will have you headbanging like crazy. Anyways, if you're looking for some good clean raw savage headbanging death/thrash metal, this album is yours. Enjoy.<br /><br />Best songs: Beneath The Remains, Inner Self, Slaves Of Pain, Primitive Future, Stronger Than Hate, and Mass Hypnosis.
B00005JNA2|5.0|...and this wonderful movie leaves me wanting to spend more time with them.  I found this to be the perfect sequel to a near perfect movie. <br /> <br />The writing, acting and direction are an amazing collaboration.  Several times the two  stroll following the camera through the beautiful Paris streets without a cut for many minutes.  Yet the conversation flows so naturally, as if this wasn't scripted... these were actually the dreams, pains, aspirations of two soulmates, still very much in love. <br /> <br />It's clear that they found each other just in time.  I hope the editor was correct... that they don't spend ten days together only to find it really isn't right.  I need them to be together nine years from now for \\"After Sunset\\".
B000002TYX|3.0|NB: This is not a greatest hits CD. For that, try \\"One,\\" with 27 career chart-toppers. <br /> <br />This is fascinating to listen to, even if you're not a Beatles nut. Everyone knows the tunes, but to hear these outtakes is to marvel at how flexible, experimental, and facile the Beatles were, as it shows them trying different permutations and instrumentations, adding interludes and codas. It demystifies the recording process, and it also lays bare the original kernels of Beatles songs that until now we've always heard overlaid with their orchestration and effects. It also exposes their personalities, as they joke and debate - especially McCartney, merry and clever. <br /> <br />This is the kind of disk that will grab your whole attention, the kind of disc you will sit down and concentrate on, reading the liner notes for each track and wishing they were longer. <br /> <br />By the same token, please note that even though this set is riveting, you might not listen to it more than once, any more than you would re-read a good biography.
B00005JMAH|5.0|We loved this movie, saw it 4 times in the theatre and wished we had a chance for several more before it went. Different than the first two movies, but wonderful.  The scenery was amazing, and it was wonderful to finally see the new characters we read about years ago. I loved seeing Prof Lupin and Sirus Black. <br />Now we can watch it 100 more times!! :) <br /> <br />I can't wait to see my book on the wide screen! What would happen if sixth grade twins, growing up in what seemed to be just an ordinary household in rural Connecticut, found out they had magical powers?  My new book takes place in CT, Switzerland, and the Black Forest of Germany.  You will fall off your broom in excitment when you see what these kids are up to in over 500 pages of young adult entertainment.  We're almost done!  Thirty kids in Newtown, CT helped edit the book this summer, and wrote the last chapter with me.  Wow - these kids are good and they know their magic!   <br /> <br />Have a great summer and watch those shelves for the moden magical epic that we are racing to get to you all soon!  The book is currently entitled, \\"The American School of Witchcraft & Wizardry\\"!  <br /> <br />Ann
B0000942HV|4.0|This album sounds good. Do I care if this is the only thing he ever did 5 and 6 times? NO! If you are troubled by that, don't listen to it, but that does not make THIS rendition a bad one. It sounds GREAT, just as powerful, but I guess nothing is more powerful than nostalgia is it? If you like tubular bells, if you wish to hear a different take on the same music of lo those many years ago, then you will LOVE this album. If you are hoping for a comeback of high-heel shoes for men with goldfish in the sole, then better stick with 1973..
B000000WCV|2.0|I really don't know what the attraction is to Homework.  No \\"5 star\\" album should have tracks that you automatically skip, like 'teachers', 'rollin and scratchin' and 'oh yeah'.  The album does have its moments: 'around the world' and 'phoenix' are great songs, but on the whole I find Homework one of the most overrated albums in the electronica genre.
B00005JN2F|4.0|I thought this movie was better than The Bourne Identity (which I liked) because it focused on the spy thriller aspect without being slowed down by dull conversations, hair cutting, and romance.  This movie moves at full speed and I like the way Bourne is totally focused on the job at hand (more so than before).  The music also makes it tense and exciting.  Like the first movie this one makes you feel like you're traveling through the world.  I hope people won't be deterred by all the negative comments regarding the shaky camera but will judge for themselves.  I have been bothered by shaky camera work in other films but not here and it isn't during the whole movie, just some action scenes. <br />It is definitely worth your while to give this absorbing spy movie a try. <br />
0515123447|5.0|This is my second book of the Jack Reacher series.  Reacher, a modern day Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry -- he kills bad guys and women just can't resist him!!  I read Pursuader first and then Killing Floor and enjoyed both of them tremendously.  Some people complained that the endings are too easy to figure out, but hey, these are action-thrillers, not mystery whodunit!!!  If you are looking for a hero who is not wishy-washy and not afraid to deliver a deadly punch to the bad guys, you should read Jack Reacher.
B0002234LS|4.0|Johnny Depp plays a writer who is in the throes of a divorce from a wife who cheated on him with another man.  He lives alone in a cabin on a lake where he is visited by a man named Shooter who accuses him of plagiarism.  Depp claims that he can prove that this accusation is false, but in the meantime bad things begin to happen to him which he attributes to Shooter.  This is an interesting psychological drama which has just the right amount of twists and turns to keep it interesting.  The acting is good and the scenery is beautiful.
B000002H1T|1.0|There's a problem here. The Cars sold mega-platinum, especially Heartbeat City, which virtually defined the mid-1980s sound and look.  So!  Why is this CD a crude, early transfer with virtually no packaging?<br /><br />Seems the problem is, Elektra's out of business, or bought-out by a larger, more apathetic company.  Also, could be the more \\"casual\\" Cars fans are tired of these Top Ten singles and MTV staples.<br /><br />Being ignored are we, the long-term, die-hard Cars fans who listen to EVERY album, EVERY summer (\\"it turns me upside-down / like a merry-go-round\\").  Whether this album is too commercial, or that other album too \\"arty\\" is NOT THE POINT.  We deserve a quality reproduction of this ground-breaking album.<br /><br />Sadly, this current CD version is sonically INFERIOR to a clean cassette, or even vinyl on a good turntable.  This.  Is.  WRONG.
B00007G1ZM|5.0|This melodramatic film noir is one of the most decorated films of the genre, nominated for 6 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and winner of the Best Actress Oscar for Joan Crawford's portrayal of the title character. Like several of film noir's most famous examples, \\"Double Indemnity\\" among them, \\"Mildred Pierce\\" is based on a novel by James M. Cain. In this case, the novel was adapted by Ranald MacDougall, with some uncredited assistance from William Faulkner. As the film opens, Mildred Pierce (Joan Crawford), a sophisticated woman, obviously distraught, makes an apparent attempt to frame a business associate for her husband's murder. She is taken to the police station, where she recounts the events of the past few years to an investigating officer. We see, in flashback, her split from her first husband, her preoccupation with providing an aristocratic lifestyle for her eldest daughter, her business success, and eventual marriage to her now-deceased second husband.<br /><br />\\"Mildred Pierce\\" was Joan Crawford's first film for Warner Bros. Studios, after a pronounced lull in her career. Crawford's depiction of Pierce's ambition and pathological indulgence of her spoiled, selfish daughter Veda (Ann Blyth) is extraordinary. She makes Mildred Pierce one of the most thoroughly captivating characters ever to grace the screen. Crawford's performance is so fascinating that it might be easy to overlook the film's supporting performances. But \\"Mildred Pierce\\" wouldn't have been so great a success without the strong, sometimes slimy, characters that surround Mildred. Ann Blyth's performance as Veda Pierce, Zachary Scott's as rakish second husband Monty Baragon, Eve Arden (who earned an Academy Award nomination) as business manager Ida, and Jack Carson as businessman Wally Fay are all unforgettable in themselves. Truly exceptional performances, writing, and direction by Michael Curtiz (of \\"Casablanca\\" fame) make \\"Mildred Pierce\\" a must-see if there ever was one.<br /><br />The DVD: The flip side of the disc contains an hour-and-a-half long documentary entitled \\"Joan Crawford: The Ultimate Movie Star\\", produced by Turner Classic Movies. Angelica Huston narrates this film that follows Joan Crawford's career and personal life from  her arrival in Hollywood in 1925 as an MGM contract player, through 2 studios, 4 marriages, and over 90 films, until her death in 1977. It includes interviews with historians, friends and family. There is also a \\"Trailer Gallery\\" of theatrical trailers for 7 of Crawford's Warner Bros. films./> <br />The DVD: The flip side of the disc contains an hour-and-a-half long documentary entitled \\"Joan Crawford: The Ultimate Movie Star\\", produced by Turner Classic Movies.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I watched this series when it aired. I wasnt sure if I would like it or not, I watched for one reason.....Joss Whedon....Creator.  I am a big fan of this multi-talented man. So I watched, I was immediately captivated by the crew and story. I eagerly awaited each episode, and I was extremely suprised when it was cancelled. I was upset. <br /> But now that I have the DVD set, I can watch every episode...even the never aired ones...over and over... I love the bonus footage.......after watching each episode, you have to watch them again with the commentary on. <br />The writing, acting, filming, costumes, every thing....they are all fabulous.....I eagerly await the September 30,2005 release of the big screen movie version...... 'Serenity' I can hardly wait...but these dvd's are helping. I advise everyone to get your dvd set today and to go see the movie in theatres 09-30-06
0792165020|5.0|Somewhat nostalgic thriller/comedy about \\"La Dolce Vita\\" in Italy in the 1950's, complete with jazz clubs and  rich American expatriates lounging on the beaches south of Naples.  Anyone with an interest in Italy (or in jazz)  should enjoy this film;the photography is excellent and includes the Naples area,San Remo, Rome, and Venice.There are several scenes in jazz clubs with the 2 leads doing what would today be called karaoke.  In addition, the story is a challenging one about a sociopath with a brilliant criminal mind who  attempts to outfox his associates by assuming a dual identity.  Ripley \\"believes in telling the truth whenever possible,\\"he tells his  new Italian friends right at the outset.  That truth is as follows:  he would \\"rather be a fake somebody than a real nobody.\\" His talents include: \\"forgery, lies, and impersonation.\\"  He uses them all after telling his associates straight out this is the way he behaves.  The result is a thriller/comedy that will keep you guessing. The viewer, like his victims, tends to succumb to Ripley's many charms and thus to empathize with him. He does not look like a criminal or a scoundrel. Dickie and his girlfriend Marge are the first victims, but there are others as the plot unfolds.  Ripley's first lie among many is that he was a classmate of Dickie's at Princeton. To this end, he learns as much as he can about jazz. He continues with this lie until he has befriended them.    Eventually Ripley ends up killing people and then must cover his acts with alibis and quick thinking, assuming simultaneously the identity of both Dickie, his first victim, and himself--just as he said he would. He accuses Dickie of murdering Silvana, an Italian girl,another lie.  He also must hoodwink Marge, most notably,who was about to marry Dickie; the Italian police, by using Dickie's passport as a fake i.d. to rent an apartment, and a number of other relatively subordinate characters. Marge eventually catches on, but it is too late since Ripley has already gained Dickie's inheritance. I found this an entertaining and stylish thriller.  The cast is also notable and includes Matt Damon, Jude Law, and the resplendently youthful Gwynneth Paltrow and Cate Blanchett as four of the main leads.
B0002GTWYW|5.0|I just have to commend the team who actually worked on getting the release for te fans. It's a perfect element to any hip hop follower. The quality on this new release of ready to die is uncany and the DVD make it even better as a bonus. The videos add to the perfection that this modern day street poet gave to the hip hop world. Rest in peace to the greatest MC to do it in such a short time, The Notorious B.I.G.
B0002IU988|4.0|Here's the thing.<br /><br />I LIKE CREED.  While this may lead some people to dismiss this review entirely, it should also be noted that I do not, in fact, LOVE Creed.<br /><br />There now, you're back.<br /><br />I do not believe Creed to be the great, awesome, amazing thing some believe it to be, but I also do not believe it to be the great steaming pile of manure that others swear is all that Creed amounts to.  While \\"My Own Prison\\" was obviously the band's highest artistic point, there are parts in the subsequent two albums that followed that tickled my fancy quite nicely.  But let's not kid around here: Scott Stapp did NOT make this band, the REST of the band did.<br /><br />Scott Stapp, for the two subsequent albums that followed, had taken control of nearly everything.  In an effort to make music `fun' again(i.e., what it was when they made \\"My Own Prison\\"), the REST of the band and Mr. Stapp went their separate ways, and out of Creed's ashes comes ALTER BRIDGE, the Miles Kennedy version of Creed.<br /><br />This, frankly, is \\"CREED's\\" best album since \\"My Own Prison\\", due mainly to, once again, the rest of the band.  Lead guitarist Mike Tremonti basically wrote all the songs on the record, titled \\"One Day Remains\\", and it sounds much like Creed, Alter Bridge is an entirely new beast.  With Miles Kennedy on vocals, sounding more like Chris Cornell than Stapp's mad impersonation of Eddie Vedder, the band seems to remember what they used to be.  HUGE, awesome musical melodies are emanating from the REST of the band at every turn, from Scott Phillip's relentless destruction of his drum kit, on to original Creed bassist Brian Marshall's powerfully earnest playing, to Tremonti's OUTRAGEOUS mad skillz on his guitar, the band is ready to light the world on fire once again.<br /><br />Kennedy's singing is in no way obtrusive to the REST of the band.  Indeed, the band's constant musical greatness seems to invigorate and inspire Miles with every word he sings.  Tremonti's (mostly spiritual) lyrics seem alive with energy and honesty, even if they do sometimes get a little corny.  He has a great, strong, *high* voice that conveys a lot of power, and for this I am thankful.  I always rather liked Scott's voice, but I think Miles may be just a little more . . . uh, intelligent, for lack of a better vocabulary.<br /><br />The opening track, `Find the Real', makes all the positive statements I have just made quite apparent after only about a minute's listen.  A huge punishing, INTELLIGENT riff sends you cryin' for yo mammy, with a great vocal tune that displays PERFECTLY exactly what Miles is capable of.  Other `heavy' tracks include `Metalingus' and `Watch Your Words', `Metalingus' being the superior of the three, and sounding almost TOOL-like in sound and stature.  The title track is fast becoming my favorite track, due greatly to Mr. Tremonti.  I simply cannot imagine how in the FREAKING CRAP this man can possibly play this riff this quickly for this long(songs average about 5 min., I think the shortest song is like 4 min. 30 sec.).<br /><br />`Burn it Down' has a great, soft guitar melody, faintly reminiscent of `Weathered' from a couple years back, and is probably the softest song on the album.  `In Loving Memory' has a pretty, quite guitar lamenting softly of one who has passed on, and Miles is loving and gentle in his remembrance and thankfulness of said person's influence on him.  The closing track, `The End is Here', has a fabulouso, almost spooky riff, and sounds much like the beginning of `Who's Got My Back?' from \\"Weathered\\", and is probably one of my favorites on the record.  The lead single `Open Your Eyes' is also noteworthy, as it's a very strong track in every aspect and probably is the best choice for a single.<br /><br />The other tracks all have something going for'em, but those were the highlights.  Alter Bridge has created something very nice for their debut recording, and I very much hope they can keep it all upand running for a long time to come.  A great album, not as good as \\"My Own Prison\\", but hey:  it's better than `Human Clay', one of the most over-hyped cd's ever made. 4 stars.pe they can keep it all up and running for a long time to come.

B0002I831S|4.0|This all sounds wonderful . . . my only question was, will Paramount present the ORIGINAL TV version of \\"City on the Edge of Forever,\\" or the atrociously altered one released on video in every previous version (except the very 1st one in the early 1980s)?<br />  Here's how you can tell the bastardized version:  On the back of the packaging is a note that \\"certain music has been altered for this special home TV version,\\" or words to that effect.<br />  What happened is, the song heard by Kirk & Edith playing in a radio repair shop window, \\"Goodnight Sweetheart,\\" was a REAL song.  Paramount couldn't (OR WOULDN'T, I bet) get video licensing rights for the song.  So they looped in a dorky song whose lyrics begin \\"I remember you . . .\\"<br />  Problem is, the melody for \\"Goodnight, Sweetheart\\" is also used when Kirk keeps Edith from falling down the apartment stairs, and after Kirk keeps McCoy from saving Edith from being run over.  So, instead, Paramount looped in sappy arrangements of the \\"I Remember You\\" song.  YUCK!<br />  Happy Days!  This set includes the true version of \\"City\\"!<br />  Now my only whine is how intrusive the \\"video commentary\\" is.  Forget the stupid overlays and just give us text LARGE ENOUGH TO READ, and in a READABLE FONT.
B00005JN2X|4.0|Before Tom Cruise climbs in and ruins life as Jamie Foxx knows it, he provides a memorable taxi ride to Jada Pinkett Smith, an Assistant US Attorney, working on a big case, who takes a liking to Foxx.<br /><br />Enter Cruise, a hired killer with five stops to make.  He pays Foxx $600 to drive him exclusively for the night.  Cruise doesn't finish his first hit without the body dropping onto Foxx's polished cab, parked in an alley.  Cruise then forces Foxx to place the body of his victim in the trunk of the cab and continue driving.  Both men attempt to get into the other's head, but Foxx is clearly out of his league, as Cruise taunts him between kills.<br /><br />After a messy hit at a local nightclub, in which the FBI finally gets wise to the slaughter of important witnesses to their federal case, Foxx becomes increasingly desperate and more involved.  With each murder he tries ever harder to stop Cruise's killing machine.  But it is not until the plot comes full circle and Foxx learns that Cruise plans to kill the prosecutor, the lovely Ms. Jada Pinkett, that he is able to achieve anything meaningful and final.<br /><br />A low key performance for Cruise.  He's the bad guy and takes up 99% of the screen time.  Not the best film out there, but certainly worth a l
B0000C9V3T|5.0|Tarantino is a master filmmaker and his soundtracks are dead on target with the plot of the films they accompany. <br /> <br />Just as Pulp Fiction had the exact right selections on the soundtrack to match the mood of the storyline and characters, so does Kill Bill Vol. 1. With selections like \\"Bang Bang\\" from Nancy Sinatra and \\"The Lonely Shepherd\\" by pan flute master Gheorghe Zamfir all in the same score, Tarantino makes every piece of the puzzle of his films fit together with perfect harmony to deliver a powerful experience. <br /> <br />Only for those who have seen the film and enjoyed both it and the music, this soundtrack does not disappoint.
B00008EY65|4.0|This is a fun movie.  I love the way the movie looks and the attitude it takes towards its characters.  The actors give the characters just enough depth to give them a sense of being a part of a real world and yet they have enough swagger and attitude so we know it is a cartoon come to life.  Guillermo Del Toro has to be thanked for pulling this off so well.<br /><br />Ron Perlman does a superb job in realizing Hellboy.  I mean, come on!  How many actors could put on a suit that strange looking and still bring off a character that you understand with feelings and how he relates to other people?  Too bad it will be dismissed in the serious crowds because it is a cartoon character - this is a fine acting job.<br /><br />Selma Blair is touching as the firestarter who is terrified of a power she hasn't yet learned to control.  She also has mixed feelings towards Hellboy who is completely possessed by her.  It is a good match with the right mix of troubles for a movie.<br /><br />Jeffrey Tambor also adds so much to the movie with some very nice touches as Tom Manning.  His character both covers for Hellboy and views him as a bit of a problem.  Towards the end of the movie there are some nice moments as the two come to a better understanding.<br /><br />Rupert Evans is just fine as John Meyers who is the reluctant new person in charge of taking care of Hellboy.  Fresh from Quantico it is his first assignment and his youth and inexperience show, as does his good heart.<br /><br />And what can one say about John Hurt?  He is fabulous as Hellboy's \\"father\\".  Kevin Trainor is the younger version of Trevor Bruttenholm and his brief but energetic performance sets a great foundation for all that follows.<br /><br />Doug Jones provides the physical characterization of Abe Sapien.  Abe's voice is provided by David Hyde Pierce.  Abe is a good character who adds quite a bit to the story, but must have been a monster of a role to enact.  I can't imagine the difficulty of acting in that costume.<br /><br />What is a movie without villains?  This one has three very sinister ones.  Of course, their being Nazis makes them that much more evil.  Karel Roden as Grigori isn't really a Nazi, but was working with them at the beginning of the movie.  He is the head villain.  He has a girlfriend who is gorgeously played by Biddy Hodsen.  Ladislav Beran makes Kroenen the creepiest thing in the movie.  The bad guys and gals really add the spice to this movie.<br /><br />Don't expect high art here, but do expect surprisingly effective characterizations and a quality of acting far above most movies based on comic book characters.<br /><br />The extras on this disk include two commentaries that do add to your appreciation of the film and the ability to visit the sets at various points while watching the film.

B00005JKED|5.0|I thought this was going to be a by the numbers thriller.  Wrong on all counts.  It shows the dark side of police work.  I can see how good career vetrans can go bad. The only good companion to this film would be Treat Williams \\"Prince of the City\\". That one shows what happens when a officer turns in his partners.  Like \\"Prince in the City\\" it offers an uncompromised look at the way incidents are covered up.  That is why this one got the Academy Award.

B00008EY65|5.0|While I didn't follow the comic I did like two things about this movie. Ron Perlman's lead as Hellboy and creator Mike Mignola's creation being done faithfully. He didn't sell this character to Marvel and DC and still got the movie made.  I hope there is a sequel.  Unlike Spawn, which didn't have the personality of Ron Perlman's character, didn't have any successful comebacks.  Without getting too deep into the story I have to say it was a good film I would see again.  The action was in abundance in this one so you never got bored.<br /><br />This was the same Ron Pealman who was in Beauty and the Beast. Now why didn't someone make a movie about that series?

B0001L3LUE|5.0|It is the tragedy of American politics--particularly in its foreign policies--that obtuseness and intractability are admired and confused with stability and willpower, while the ability to take a measure of a situation, speak of it as it is and act prudently is viewed with suspicion and derision. It is in this way our presidents paint themselves and the country into corners, and usually leave future generations to sort out the mess.    We see this in watching FOG OF WAR, a documentary covering not just the Vietnam era, but Robert McNamara's life and career. As an 85 year old man, McNamara no longer has to please anyone, and he seems determined to leave not just the historical consequences of his career to us, but a legacy of introspection to future generations. Anyone arguing that he is not just apologizing, which is rather simplistic, but rationalizing his career are partially right, but his searing critiques of himself and US policies cannot be ignored. In many ways, it is the questions that he himself raises, and leaves open, that are the most fascinating insight into his moral development in old age.    The segments on his WWII service are well worth watching just for themselves, for this reason. McNamara was at the forefront of applying quantitative methodology, statistical analysis, to the prosecution of war. This is something that the US pioneered and remains to this day its most effective practitioner. The same techniques of analysis that New York uses to combat crime were applied to find the most efficient ways to wage total war. That the answer was, in the end, to slaughter as many enemy civilians as possible was merely a logical conclusion of the methodology, the moral aspect didn't factor into this. The documentary makers' graphics of bombers dropping numbers and symbols on cities perfectly captures this.    It's been some time since I watched this, so I won't go into detail. However, I think everyone should see this; every high school civics class should watch it; and every college campus should present it. The complexity of political morality comes through. You could also tell that the makers challenged McNamara; in the rare instances you hear their questions to him, it is usually in an incredulous tone. I think that challenge was something McNamara was determined to meet in as honest a way as he could, and it enhances the power of his words.    Parts of it are organized into chapters, \\"McNamara's lessons of war.\\" It is an interesting and I think fruitful approach. After Vietnam, American society approached the war mainly at the visceral level, through movies and painful subjective accounts, and reflection on the social divisions of the era. Recently, it seems that Vietnam is being approached on a more sophisticated level, in terms of the questions raised and the answers given or discovered. FOG OF WAR contributes to that.    McNamara, we are reminded, also served for some time as president of the World Bank. Knee-jerk anti-globalists, while they have a lot of reasonable objections to the destructiveness of the market religion, like to focus on a few institutions as their bogeymen. The incompetence and intellectual bankruptcy of the IMF needs no mentioning, however I suggest the rabble-rousers consider carefully McNamara's account of the World Bank.    The DVD extras are interesting in their own right, and a few serve to amplify the documentary. I suggest the DVD THE TRIALS OF HENRY KISSINGER as a fitting companion to this. Fully deserves five stars.
B0002IU988|4.0|I bought this CD after letting the first single, \\"Open Your Eyes\\", grow on me. I have all the Creed cds and thought that they were a pretty good band, although Stapp's \\"creative control\\" of the band caused them to diminish in style and depth. Now that he's off the ticket, let's see if the rest of the band can do better. <br /> <br />The first track, \\"Find The Real\\", is an explosive opener, with a good spotlight on Tremonti's MONSTER guitar skills. If there is anything that draws me into this CD, it's the phenomenal guitar work. Tremonti ranks up there with Eddie Van Halen and Zakk Wylde, in terms of technique and overall \\"chunkage\\". <br /> <br />All in all, this CD has a few VERY good tracks (\\"One Day Remains\\", \\"Watch Your Words\\", and \\"Burn It Down\\"), but with all the slow, chill-out songs on this album, Myles Kennedy's sappy vocals begin to wear on you. He starts to attempt to become emotional and touchy-feely, which was probably Stapp's biggest problem in the first place. <br /> <br />Minus the few sappy ballads, this CD is a shot in the dark for all rock fans. Some will like Kennedy's vocal ability; others won't. I personally am growing quite fond of this CD, and definately think it was worth the ten bucks I spent for it. <br /> <br />Recommended.
B0000VAFO0|2.0|I didn't have high expectations when I went to see this in the movie, but I was looking forward to seeing it. All in all it was a let down. The director was out of his depth and the plot and script were silly. <br /> <br />This could have been a cool, gothy flick, with fans applauding any shameless MATRIX ripoffs. It could have gone for a campy appeal, relying on some interesting special effects to hold it up. Instead, it is unintentionally campy, humorless and the action sequences overall were boring. <br /> <br />The plot, some sort of zero sum political battle between Werewolves and Vampires, when in the end they should all just get along, is a stinker. We have Werewolves versus Vampires, Vampires versus Vampires, and Big Movie versus Audience Apathy. In the end, neither Movie nor Audience win. And as for Werewolves versus Vampires, who cares?  <br /> <br />The political plotline is uninteresting, all betrayals will be telegraphed before you get the DVD out of the packaging, and the script is mainly the same two or three conversations/arguments ocurring over and over. <br /> <br />The first action scene--in the subway--was cool. But the rest of the movie doesn't live up to it. One of the biggest problems with the action sequences was the almost total absence of innocent and oblivious Humans. The neat thing about the first MATRIX was that you were in on a secret while society-at-large was filled with a bunch of unhip squares, totally unaware of all the neato things and swell drama happening around them. If you are going to have cool action scenes in a movie like this, you want to have chaos and battles with a bunch of rubes getting in the way. More realistic that way. The gloomy Eastern European cityscape is cool, but it's not enough.  <br /> <br />Kate Beckinsale is a fine actress, and works hard to carry this thing, but in the end the overly-obvious attempt to set up a sequel looks a little desperate. I'm surprised that they are still going ahead with one, apparently due to start filming in September 2004. Apart from a few diehards and a mandatory goth presence, I doubt a lot of people will be willing to give the second one a chance, let alone a third if they're serious about a trilogy. Who knows, though. What they do need to do is get a good script team in there.
B00005JN2X|5.0|Michael Mann is at the top of his game.  This riveting thriller combines nicely etched characters, sharp and pointed dialogue, explosive action and violence, delivered with the intelligence, wit and intensity Mann brilliantly brings to the genre.  Like Tarantino, Michael Mann knows when the extreme closeup of his actors faces is all that is required to reveal character and mood and that cross-cutting this intimacy with superbly choreographed violence creates atmosphere and tension lacking from the films of their less-gifted bretheren.<br /><br />The film just plain looks great.  Michael Mann captures the nighttime streets of LA in as mesmerizing a way as his daytime shootout on those same streets in Heat was simply un-toppable.  Beyond the look, the choices of locales, and the mood and pace of the film are spot-on.<br /><br />Tom Cruise is terrific in this role and is matched all the way by Jamie Foxx.  It is basically a two character drama, so the two leads had to carry their weight and they did so admirably.  I had no trouble accepting \\"pretty-boy\\" Cruise as a ruthless, coldly calculating, remorseless and relentless contract killer.  It is a very nice piece of work.  Jamie Foxx has the more difficult \\"straight-man\\" role, and he acquits himself well.<br /><br />The production is meticulous.  The supporting cast, down to the smallest role, is perfect, with Jada Pinkett Smith and Mark Ruffalo carrying the largest support, but also fine cameos by Javier Bardham and others.<br /><br />This is class work by a fine director, cast and crew.  The 5 stars are, of course, for fans of thrillers.  The story may be a stretch with a bit of a hole here and there, the climax almost Terminator-like in relentlessness, but you will be hard pressed to find a more intense or better thriller anywhere.  This is the movies folks, done by people who know how to make em!
B00012FXB8|4.0|Like Alien, and unlike Aliens, Alien 3 returns to the format of an isolated area, improvised weapons, duplicitous/idiotic authority figures, and only a single alien. <br /> <br />It's great for the most. Unfortunately, a lot of the CGI is still primitive, and they clearly wanted to have a more visible monster in the end sequence. However, up to that, the plot is excellent, the prison-planet scenario was imaginative, and Sigourney Weaver was great. <br /> <br />I'm still a fan of the first one over all the others, however. But really, for a money-making franchise, it just doesn't get any better than Alien.
B00000DRA9|4.0|I bought this CD solely because I--like many others--admire the film The NeverEnding Story, which has achieved something of a cult status. Anyway, one of the strong elements of that film is its soundtrack. <br /> <br />I must admit I was somewhat disappointed at first (when I began listening), because some of what's on the CD is by no means the same music as can be heard in the film. As other reviewers mentioned, some of the tracks are synthesized hybrids or something. Perfect example is track 3, The Ivory Tower. Listen and ... weep? Well, it's not that bad but not what I had expected, either. It's not that I dislike these synthesized versions, but I would have preferred original material. <br /> <br />But don't worry, later tracks are excellent and whisk you right back into Fantasia. <br /> <br />I would say, revisit the film again, read the book (if you haven't done so already), and whenever you are short on time (or for whatever other reason), listen to this CD. And what you probably also want to know, the CD is almost 37 minutes long. <br /> <br />What I'm going to do now is try to get my hands on Die Unendliche Geschichte (Import Soundtrack), which, as reviewers say, is indispensable, as it contains only Klaus Doldinger's music (I have nothing against Moroder, though) and never-before-heard material. Well, I hope to write a review of that CD sometime soon.
B00009MGGI|4.0|Me watching this took on the manner of a voracious animal consuming its prey. The entire trilogy is beautifully done, magnificiently produced, and the acting is simply incomparable. <br /> <br />The HOUSE OF CARDS, the first season, is quite clearly the best. The wit, the plot, the sheer malignancy of it is just pure delight. I worked briefly at the House of Commons, and I thought the presentation of Parliament and Westminster politics was brilliant. I don't think there is anything equal to the cynicism on display here, as France Urquhart (Ian Richardson) cheerfully outmaneuvers and destroys his political opponents (his colleagues within his party). The mockery of the British political system is right on. Richardson has these asides to the audience that work perfectly, and heighten the hilarity. It's what something like WAG THE DOG wishes it could be for American politics, but unfortunately American audiences don't always have the political sophistication to enjoy this level of satire. ***** <br /> <br />TO PLAY THE KING has Urquhart as Prime Minister (known appropriately by the initials FU), master of his domain. The arc in this series focuses on the place of the monarchy in the constitutional system, with many asides on homosexuality in politics, manipulation of the press, exploitation of disaters, and the staging of politically convenient terrorist attacks. Not as good as the first season by any measure, however, Urquhart's systematic destruction of the King (a brilliant Michael Kitchen) masterfully communicates some of the political tensions built into Britain's constitution. This season generated a lot of controversy with the British public, many of whom thought it was intentionally and excessively disrespectful to the monarchy (see the DVD extras). All in all, the writing doesn't have the same degree of biting and wit, although Richardson's performance is still on the money. **** <br /> <br />THE FINAL CUT is the unforunate third season, and takes on the character of Shakespeare's RICHARD III, but makes it tedious. Richardson's vicious asides to the audience are almost totally absent, which relieves him of his charm. It's not nearly as funny or interesting, and seems to meander along until its excessive and fairly overwrought ending. The spirit of cynicism is tries to maintain takes on a certain unreality, and this robs it of the delicious aspect of the first season. By the end, this version of Britain is so remote that it just isn't plausible or engaging. We are basically reduced to watching the antics of some banana republic, but with Westminster Palace in the background. ** <br /> <br />So respectively five stars, four stars, and two stars; averaging out to just over 3.6, I will round up as the kindly teachers of my childhood instructed me, and thus four stars for the set.
B00005JL0U|5.0|i went to see this movie back in 88 when it was a theatrical release and brought it when released on vhs and i find it the best movie of its kind i think that it is defiantly for michael jackson fans and for those with a fun sense of humour i think that people who are blinded by the contreversy of what is happening at the mo with michael and should if they are real fans to focus on his music and the fun he brings to the music and videos ive been a fan of michaels for 25 years so it proves how dedicated i am to michael jackson. all i say is anyone who hasnt seen moonwalker yet should see it they will love it
B0001MDP3G|5.0|War is terrible. What an understatement! Today, with high tech weaponry, and a news media careful of viewers' sensibilities, it is difficult to understand, in the gut, how much horror is involved in war - unless, of course, we lose a loved one. And the War Between The States, which destroyed a generation, was one of the most terrible.<br /><br />\\"Cold Mountain\\" opens with scenes from the 1864 Siege of Petersburg. The footage portrays the brutal effects of explosions, with the resulting burning violence which tears men's bodies to pieces. The chaotic battle scenes, the blood, filth, mindlessness and terror of close combat, are some of the most realistic I have ever seen. Just before the battle, confederate soldier Inman, (Jude Law), receives a letter from his beloved, Ada, asking him to come home to her. \\"Mr. Inman,\\" she writes, \\"If you are fighting, stop fighting. If you are marching, stop marching. Come home to me, please. This is my request. Come home to me.\\" Weary, after years at the front, and badly wounded after the siege, he escapes from a field hospital and begins his odyssey home to Cold Mountain, NC....and to Ada, whose image has accompanied him for long years, and \\"prevented him from falling into a darkness.\\" He treks across the war ravaged land, meeting murderous men from both North & South, who want to \\"put him in the ground.\\" Along the way, he is sometimes nursed and cared for by desperately lonely women left behind. But his goal is always Ada and Cold Mountain.<br /><br />Ada Monroe, (Nicole Kidman), a southern belle from Charleston, moved to Cold Mountain along with her father, a minister, (Donald Sutherland), shortly before war broke out. Both Inman & Ada were too shy and inexperienced to express their growing feelings toward each other until he marched off, amongst friends & flags, to fight for glory. The two were finally able to communicate their emotions. Although the couple had spent little \\"real time\\" together, sometimes a look, a gesture, a few words of mutual understanding, can form a bond which days, hours and minutes cannot. Time to live and love, a most precious commodity, is a reoccurring theme throughout the film. When Ada's tells her father that she and Inman only spent a brief period together, he responds, \\"I lost your mother after 22 months of marriage. It was enough for a lifetime.\\"<br /><br />When Ada's father dies, she struggles to survive alone, with no money, in a town where all able-bodied men have gone to war. She was educated to be an accomplished lady, not to work a farm. Then Ruby, (Renee Zellweger), a tough talkin' woman-of-all-trades enters, to help out. Zellweger is extraordinary as an abused woman with a hard shell surrounding a sensitive soul and a kind heart. As cliched as this role sound, Zellweger is an original - a real scene stealer.<br /><br />Kidman is luminous as Ada, and Jude Law's is wonderful in his portrayal of Inman, the intense young man, painfully disillusioned but determined to survive. Gabriel Yared's wonderful, frequently melancholy folk music from the Civil War period, adds beauty and authenticity. Bring tissues - this is a real tearjerker! Bravo to director Anthony Minghella who remains true to Charles Frazier's excellent novel of the same title! Highly recommended!<br /><br />JANAfew words of mutual understanding, can form a bond which days, hours and minutes cannot.

B00005JMUA|4.0|Kill Bill vol. 2 is very different then Kill Bill Vol. 1.  It seems less stylized and more like an average action flick.  The fights all seem anticlimactic.  It is very dialogue heavy but the dialogue is very good.  Even though it's not as good as the first, you owe it to yourself to see it if you liked Vol 1.
B00005JLEX|5.0|Okay, I might sound like the biggest loser there IS, but I don't think I am alone in being absoluetly elated--and amazed that the best show of all time-Seinfeld is now available for us diehard fans...season by season. (Hold on wishful thinkers, so far there is only seasons one, two and three- but that's FINE with me!!)  To be quite honest, I wasn't sure that we would ever finally get the chance to have our beloved episodes on actual DVD. (I have pretty much every episode on TAPE-my room is LITTERED with them).  Reasons being I didn't know if the cast (mainly Jerry, Joulia Louis-Dreyfus, and Jason Alexander) would ever be able to put aside their real-life petty differences and give us what we have really wanted for a long time--am I  correct? <br />Hope I have given some helpful opinions and I am givin' this DVD, each and every season, (even the not quite so on-the-ball, less funny and believable last couple of seasons) 5 stars, two thumbs up!
B00005JMEW|5.0|I think kill bill vol. 1 is a great movie.  Uma Thurman is great as the bride, as she displays a great amount of ferocity and determination and delivers great fight scenes.  The casting is phenomenal with Lucy Lui and Vivica A. Fox portraying equally fierce women.  The little dialogue in the movie is quick, sharp, and witty.  The only part of the movie I didn't like was the animation scene, it seemed really unnecessary and it was slightly confusing.  If you like action flicks that don't take themselves too seriously I would definitely recommend Kill Bill.  However, if violence isn't your cup of tea, you should definitely skip this movie.

B00029NMRM|2.0|The movie, \\"The Whole Nine Yards\\",  that was the catalyst for this sequel, was a hysterically funny, black comedy with a great cast and a very tight, well-written script. While this film still has the same great cast, they can only work with what they have, and what they have is an incomprehensible script from hell.<br /><br />This is a film that is embarrassing to watch. The only comfort for those cast in this contrived and confounding piece of drivel is that they were paid big bucks for reprising their original roles. The ever charming Bruce Willis, reprising his role of retired hit man, Jimmy the Tulip, is barely able to make his character likable. Matthew Perry, reprising his role of Oz, dentist and  Jimmy's friend, turns his former good guy innocence into total  buffoonery that is contrived and unfunny. Jill, his former dental hygienist turned professional hit woman, is played again by the lovely Amanda Peet,  now married to Jimmy, and has seemingly lost any intelligence she had in the original film.<br /><br />For those watching this film, there is little to keep one interested, as the plot makes no sense. The only people who may want to watch this film are those who loved the prequel and are interested in seeing how the mighty have fallen.  This film is barely worth a rental.
6305508550|4.0|Office Space is a ruthless, no holds-barred comedy. Anyone who has ever spent even a day working in a cubicle will definitely appreciate this and relate to the characters. It's a different kind of Hollywood comedy; funny and clever. Ron Livingston is terrific and this is the kind of unique film Jennifer Aniston should do more often (no more Along Came Polly's). I enjoyed Office Space and recommend it to anyone with their own office space that they want to knock down and burn. This is a highly enjoyable and cute film.
B00003CXXP|5.0|This is a film that is both entertaining and thought provoking. It raises some questions about concepts and emotions that human beings sometimes take for granted. It is also a spinoff of the fairy tale \\"Pinocchio\\", with William Hurt as \\"Geppetto\\" and Haley Joel Osment as the sci-fi version of \\"Pinocchio\\".<br /><br />Haley Joel Osment, as the mechanical creation, \\"David\\", who just wants to be a real boy, gives the performance of a lifetime. If he does not get an Oscar for his performance, then I do not know what the standards are. Suffice to say, he is nothing short of sublime in the starring role. He is, without a doubt, one of the best child actors of all time.<br /><br />Jude Law, as \\"Gigolo Joe\\", a mechanical love machine expressly created for the purpose of servicing the carnal desires of women, gives a riveting performance, as well. While he is great in the role, he is, as is everyone else in the film, totally upstaged by his pint-sized co-star, Haley Joel Osment.<br /><br />The movie takes place sometime in the future, when human look alike robots, nicknamed \\"Mechas\\", assist humans in their every day lives. They are very realistic, but stop short of feeling or demonstrating real emotion. They are merely mechanical creations, made to service humans, and all are made to adult scale.<br /><br />William Hurt, as a hot shot engineer with Cybertronics, a firm that makes \\"Mechas\\", decides to improve upon this further, by creating a \\"Mecha\\" child who will be able to love back, thus filling a market need. Shortly thereafter, \\"David\\" is created and placed with a family who has a son who is appears to be comatose and terminally ill.<br /><br />Initially, all goes well, and his \\"mother\\" grows to love David, setting into play a sequence of events that will have impact on the entire family, including David, who loves his \\"mother\\" unconditionally. When her biological son, Martin, miraculously recovers from his illness and returns home, things at home start to change for David, as issues of territoriality and jealousy arise.<br /><br />Though under pressure from her husband, David's \\"mother\\" finds herself unable to do what she is contractually mandated to do, should she wish to free herself of David. Instead, she abandons him in the woods with some cautionary, tearful advice. This sets David off on a fairy tale quest that, no matter what the setbacks, will always be singular in scope. He wants to find his mother, whom he loves, and return to the place he perceives to be his home.<br /><br />What happens to David along his singleminded journey is certainly disturbing, and always thought provoking. His quest will expose him to the underbelly of life, and take him on a journey that is the stuff of dreams and, at times, nightmares. It is a story of hope and, at times, profound despair.<br /><br />One thing, however, is certain. It is unlikely that there will be a dry eye in the house. While some may claim that this is merely a manipulative ploy, I say it is movie making at its best, as it compels the audience to emotionally react. At the same time, it raises thought provoking questions. In this day, where the words \\"genome\\", \\"clone\\", and \\"stem cell\\" are part of one's everyday vocabulary, maybe we should be giving this film some considerable thought.<br /><br />All in all, this is quality movie making at its best. With spectacular, first class, special effects, and superlative acting, it makes for a movie viewing experience that should not be missed. While the film may be a little uneven in parts, this may be due to the joining of two very divergent, and diametrically opposed, styles, that of Spielberg, who still looks at the world with childlike wonder and rose colored glasses, and that of the late Stanley Kubrick, who had a darker vision and more cynical take on life. Nonetheless, in years to come, I have little doubt that this film will be classified as a masterpiece.d, as issues of territoriality and jealousy arise.<br /><br />Though under pressure from her husband, David's \\"mother\\" finds herself unable to do what she is contractually mandated to do, should she wish to free herself of David.

B000002BFL|5.0|I've been listening to Springsteen since the early 1980's and love most of his work so when I write that The Ghost of Tom Joad is his most sublime album, I don't mean it lightly. It never gets old.
B00003CXXS|3.0|This film has outstanding special effects, excellent cinematography, a wonderful cast, and a thin script. While it is better than the second film in the Jurassic Park series, it comes nowhere near equaling the original Jurassic Park movie.<br /><br />This film sees two of the original stars return, Sam Neill, as paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant, and Laura Dern, in a cameo reprising her original role. Add William Macy and Tea Leoni, as a divorced couple who kidnap Dr. Grant and take him to Isla Sorna, site of Jurassic Park II, on a search and rescue mission for their twelve year old son, who disappeared eight weeks earlier while parasailing over Isla Sorna with his mother's boyfriend.<br /><br />After the initial breathtaking, opening scene of the boy and his mother's friend parasailing, the movie starts going south almost immediately, which is not to say that it is not enjoyable. It is, but not as enjoyable as it could have been, had it been filmed with an intelligent script.<br /><br />The movie is only an hour and a half long. In the process of making it a succinct film, the actors race through the plot, leaving certain questions unanswered or certain issues unexplained, in the almost indecent haste to get the film over with.<br /><br />The actions of some of the characters are often unbelievable. Clearly terrorized, the characters do not hesitate to run off by themselves. They also do not hesitate to make as much noise as possible. Obviously, they do this in order to put themselves into a situation where they will be injured, chased, or eaten by a dinosaur.<br /><br />As I said, little thought appears to have been given to formulating an intelligent script. Still, if the viewer is willing to suspend all rational thought, one should get some enjoyment from viewing this moderately entertaining film
B000286RKW|5.0|They'd watch this vibrantly and violently visceral attack on the criminal underworld from a cinematic perspective never indulged.  Luxurious lighting and centurious casting dominate this film that was robbed by Kevin Costner's lamely laborious Dances with blah blah blah.  This was the best picture, not some lame, feel bad for the man's ineffective spiritual growth, romp of a tale in the plains of nothingness.  By the way, the drunkfellas drinking game is great for college parties.  Take a shot everytime you here the F-word and you'll hit the floor before the first hour is over.  Brilliant!!!!!!!!
B00005JMUA|5.0|I don't buy the conceit that \\"Volume 1\\" is Tarantino's eastern and \\"Volume 2\\" is his western despite a predominately western setting and the co-opting of Ennio Morricone scores from Sergio Leone's westerns.  That said, this is a great movie.  Tarantino is still exploring the eastern themes that he did in \\"Volume 1\\" yet he is also exploring more mature character relationships that he did in my personal favorite film of his, \\"Jackie Brown\\". <br />The likelihood is that Uma Thurman's multilayered performance(one moment she's a revenge-bent killer, the next a nurturing mother) will be overlooked at Oscar time because this film will probably be viewed in highbrow circles as a \\"genre film\\".  David Carradine also gives an excellent performance here.  You can almost sympathize with his rationalization for wanting Thurman's \\"Beatrix\\" dead for walking out on him.  After all, even killers can get a broken heart.  Not to be overlooked is Michael Madsen's performance as Budd, Bill's assassin brother turned drunken bouncer.  Madsen imbues this character with such pathos that we even like him despite him trying to bury Thurman alive.  The last chapter, where Thurman confronts Carradine seems to labor at times, however, Carradine's dissertation on the \\"Superman\\" myth may touch on the primary theme here.  We are who we are even if we try to escape into an alter-ego.  This may be Tarantino's way of saying that his films may be looked down on because they seem to glorify violence, even if their done stylishly.  However, Tarantino makes no apologies for making these films because they contain themes that interest him.  On a final note, the DVD contains a deleted scene that's pretty good.  I can see why it wasn't included in the theatrical cut because it doesn't seem to fit into the basic structure of the film but it should be checked out.
B0000VAFO0|5.0|Somewhat lost in 2003's \\"sequel-o-rama\\" was this sci-fi/action masterpiece released Sept 19 of that year. Here we have great originality of script & ambience; the 'underworld' war raging between vampires & lychens (werewolves), complete with modern-day weaponry & very believeable scenarios makes this the thriller of the year. Beckinsale's character was a bit oversold, although she did perform well above my expectations as a \\"Master Death Dealer\\" of the vampire clan.  <br />The film's shining star is in fact, the screenwriting & directing; both lending to the always-night-time ambience & the subtle but convincing eerieness of the entire plot. The Script brings many sub-plots along with the main story, making this a 'see it again' classic.  <br />Yes, Matrix & Terminator sequels are great...but when is the last time we were graced with leather-clad vampires sporting full-auto 9mm. assault pistols?

B0002KVUKM|2.0|I love these kind of movies but I was somewhat disappointed with van helsing.  First off when the movie starts off it seams like some sort of spoof film based on the old frankenstein movie.  Once the black and white section ends it starts to get a little better.  The most disappointing part about the movie I thought was the dracula character.  He had a very poor stage presence which made his character very dull.  Overall it is somewhat entertaining but they could have done better.

B00003CXB2|5.0|<br /> <br />There are actually some who say they don't like this film because it's way too long and kind of pointless. This is not the case at all. <br /> <br />This is the true story of T.E. Lawrence, a smart-ass English Army officer who rallied the Arabian people to freedom from Turkey. Peter O'Toole makes his first ever film performance here, and it's one hell of a performance. Opposite him is Omar Sharif, who carries the film in every minute of his time as Lawrence's partner. Then there's Alec Guinness (otherwise known as Obi-Wan Kenobi, but he actually thought that his performance here would be the one people remembered him for. Heh.) as Prince Feisal, who almost seems the most neutral character I've ever seen in a film. The rest of the cast is really just supporting, but the overall acting should have at least been awarded some Academy brass. <br /> <br />Anyone who's seen the Sergio Leone westerns can enjoy this film from start to almost the finish, because the cinematography is amazing. The sweeping desert dunes and sandstorms and rocks is incredible. Even the transition cuts are out of this world (You'll see what I mean). To add to an already great look, Maurice Jarre's breathtaking musical score further amplifies the feel of the film to an epic level. Anyway you look at it, despite the length, the film deserved all seven Academy Awards it won. <br /> <br />Yet however great this film is, there were just a few problems I had with it. At first from all the hype and some background into the story, I thought this was going to be a fun Indiana Jones-type adventure with plenty of action, shown in an entertaining way. Yes, this is a war film set in WWI, but this is more of a war drama than an adventurous action romp. It deals primarily with Lawrence's turmoil of being a soldier first and a human being second. At some points of the film you may think that he's somehow wondered into the sheer oblivion of hell, and his entire efforts only amount being able to staybarely alive. At one particular point with a Turkish General, the mood become much more grim and sets the tone for the rather depressing ending. However, it truly reflects Lawrence's anguish at all his efforts being worth so little. <br /> <br />Yet while the film has a rather sour message, there's one scene where he argues with Omar Sharif about going back through certain death to save one man who's been left behind. Sharif desperately warns O'Toole not to go back, whereas Lawrence makes his famous line of \\"Nothing is written!\\", and at the moment of his returning with the man it creates the most memorable scene of the whole film. That's the essence of the movie: Sacrifice. Complete and utter sacrifice. <br /> <br />I would highly reccomend this one for anyone who appriciates great cinema.
B0002IU988|5.0|This is actually a really good CD. I went to buy it just because I knew it had former Creed members in it. I didn't like the lead singer at first because his voice was kind of obnoxious, but after listening to the CD for a few days, I have gotten used to him and I really like him.  The guitar solos are AMAZING. In Alter Bridge, Tremonti has more solos and stand out alot more that what he did in Creed.  I also still hear a bit of Creed in some of the songs, but I like that because Creed was a great band.  Great CD, definately buy this.
B000286S8S|3.0|If u are not a Van Halen fan but like to have the hits and \\"some more\\" go buy this cd. As you probably hear on the first CD the music isn't outdated, most of the music is really timeless. <br /> <br />I bought all records except the compilation cd's.  <br />Some essential tracks like \\"mean streets\\" and \\"I'm the one\\" are missing.  <br /> <br />'Regarding adding new tracks - message to fans considering to buy this ' <br /> <br />they use compilation disks as milky cows by putting up new  tracks. As with the former compilation the new tracks are even crappier than ever (the roth tracks on the former compilation were more lively).  Eddie should join metallica to play depressive tunes. And all these stupid hassles with intros, they were never a progressive or harmonic rock band, what's the stupid style switch? Next time boogie woogie? Obviously, the energy's gone except the need for money. Bands: don't use/insult your fan base to buy compilation records because of 3 new crappy tracks.  <br /> <br />Meehhh a milky cow from Holland not paying money/tribute for compilation discs. 'We're only in for the money' would be a nice title for this disc
1400032717|5.0|It has been a long time since a novel touched me in quite this way.  Other reviews have told bits and pieces about the book (and in some cases too much, in my opinion), but a review can't capture this story.  You simply must read this book.  I took the audio version on a long car trip and the time flew.  I can't help but wonder what happened to Christopher next.  It is that kind of book.  Read it.
0684800713|3.0|Believe it or not, this is the first book in my 48 years I've ever read by this lionized author. And while it probably won't be my last Hemingway book, I hope his other works are more fulfilling than this. There are really no characters I cared about in this novel. It's just a bunch of drunken expatriates hanging out in Europe. I sure wish I could afford to do that. Nevertheless, it's sort of a time capsule of this period of time with this particular group of people. There is some heartbreak involved, but nothing much really seems to happen. For a 1920's period piece with much more depth and a much more compelling story, I would recommend \\"The Great Gatsby\\" by F. Scott Fitzgerald. \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" is not a total waste, so I'll give it a half-hearted recommendation just because it's Hemingway and does have a unique, lean style. I just don't think it's great. Chalk it up as a decent first effort.
0767836324|4.0|This is a brilliant movie. Peter Pan has always been one of my favourite stories, and I still have the same J.M. Barrie book I had as a child, which continues on the story, with John & Michael growing up, and saying what everyone else was doing. I always skipped the rest of the story, and read the ending.<br /><br />Peter Pan is now grown up, into the 'pirate', who ignores his wife and kids, to concentrate on an all important job. He's played brilliantly here by Robin Williams, a less comedic role for him this time. Also playing the old Wendy, is a fantastic actress by the name of Maggie Smith. She can turn her hand to anything, and still be wonderful. Tinkerbell is surprisingly played by Julia Roberts, which is quite strange. (Her nickname on the film set was apparently Tinkerhell) There's something not quite right about her playing Tinkerbell. For starters she looks nothing like the Tinkerbell more well known from the Disney movies, and when she becomes a 'big' Tinkerbell, and tells Peter she loves him, it's extremely unbelievable.<br /><br />There are a lot of cameos in this movie, which I discovered by looking at the cast list. Gwyneth Paltrow is one of the more noticeable ones, in a blink-a-few-times-and-you'll-miss-her role. The kissing couple who begin to float when some fairy dust lands on them are actually George Lucas and Carrie Fisher in a cameo. The pirate shut in the chest with the scorpion was played by Glenn Close - I'll have to re-watch that scene, as it looks nothing like her! Also appearing in a tiny role is Phil Collins - weird I know, he plays a policeman.<br /><br />Apart from the two extremely bratty children, what really annoyed me was the fact only Tootles was the only original Lost Boy in it. (If I remember correctly, did Wendy not take them all home with her at the end of the book? I haven't read it in years!) The other Lost Boys were: Slightly, Nibs, Curly, and the unnamed Twins.<br /><br />John Williams does a terrific score to this, but mostly, it matches the scene at the time, and isn't very memorable after you've finished watching it. (That means don't play it to me, and try to make me guess it next time!)<br /><br />Dustin Hoffman makes a great Hook. He's totally evil, although slightly OTT and camp at the same time! He has the right blend to make it just right. And Smee (Bob Hoskins) is fantastic! He's so funny! There are two great lines that he comes out with in this. These are:<br /><br />Smee: I've just had an apostrophe.<br /><br />Captain Hook: I think you mean an epiphany.<br /><br />Smee: No... lightning has just struck my brain.<br /><br />Captain Hook: Well, that must hurt.<br /><br />and the bit where he's running about, just before he gathers up all the gold, where he's looking for Smee - who's him!<br /><br />Watching this film on DVD, I found it had really aged. You can see the white lines, especially when they're flying, around the characters, and although I still love this movie, and give it four out of five, it just doesn't have the same magic as when you're young.<br /><br />On the DVD is the usual: trailers, still galleries, interviews, featurettes, and a very weird set top game, which I can't get my head around.<br /><br />If you can pick up this DVD cheap (I got it for £2.99, which I'm still shocked about), then it's well worth it. Wish I was still young enough, NOT to notice the white lines around the characters, and still believe they can fly.his, but mostly, it matches the scene at the time, and isn't very memorable after you've finished watching it.

B0002858YS|5.0|Someone should mention to the reviewers below that the Killers are from Vegas, and the last time I checked, that was located in the Good Ol' U. S. of A., NOT Britain.<br /><br />This is the first album from the quartet, and I think it's terrific.  \\"Somebody Told Me\\" might be a radio favorite, but that doesn't  mean that it isn't a great song with a terrific hook.  In addition, the album features several other single-worthy tracks: \\"Jenny was a friend of mine\\" and \\"Andy, You're a Star\\" are two of my favorites.<br /><br />The band's sound reminds me a bit of Interpol but with a keyboard.  I can't wait to hear more from these guys!
B00005KAQP|4.0|This is definitely one of those movies which you'll remember for years afterwards, and will you leave you on a high afterwards - although, personally, Coyote Ugly always does it for me.<br /><br />Apart from Ghost, this is one of Whoopi's best movies. She's hilarious in it, especially when she finds out she can't get lucky - you're in a convent darling, and the nun's habit isn't likely to attract any guys!<br /><br />Sister Act has a marvellous cast, most of who came back for the sequel (which includes a young Lauryn Hill). Maggie Smith and Harvey Keitel are stand outs, Maggie playing an old-fashioned nun, who likes things done just right and Harvey plays an outrageous mobster. My two favourite nuns are Sister Mary Patrick (played by Kathy Najimy) and Sister Mary Robert (played by Wendy Makkena).<br /><br />Whoopi Goldberg originally starts up off playing a fed up lounge singer, who, when she goes into the convent, has to teach the choir how to sing. With hilarious results. There are a lot of fantastic songs in this including: \\"My Guy\\", \\"I Will Follow Him\\", \\"Rescue Me\\", and \\"If My Sister's In Trouble\\". Most of Sister Mary Robert's singing is absolutely fantastic, although I reckon it was a voice stand in, and not her own voice!!!!<br /><br />Surprisingly, there are extras on this DVD! A trailer, and 2 videos! Oh well, it's better than nothing - which is what I was expecting. The two videos are \\"If My Sister's In Trouble\\" by Lady Soul, featuring Sister Mary Patrick, and Sister Mary Robert, wearing their nun costumes, and rather a lot of makeup, and \\"I Will Follow Him\\", which is just a video made to promote the film.<br /><br />This is a brilliant film, although I can imagine some cynics out there not enjoying it! I do though, and that's all that matters.
B00005JMAH|5.0|i love Harry Potter and i'm a big fan. interesting in this because i love the characters of RON,HERMIONE AND HARRY POTTER, they are a good friends and also th ebig thing is that they are atying in Hogwarts school of Witchgraft and Wizardry, so much magic so if someone interested about being a magical person like Harry buy the DVD's of first 3 movies and the story books(6)
B00008PW2D|5.0|This show is about four women who live in the city and talk about and do sex.  Oh, Theyre not married, but GET OVER IT PEPLE!!! IT HAPPENS&#60; OK!?? Also its NOT pornogrofy.  They only show them from the waist up (most of the time) and for it to be porn they have to show it all.  But the best part is watching the ACTORS got hrough all kinds of emotions from sadness to comedy!!  SO get this if you have an open mind and like to watch actors at work!
B00003CX9S|5.0|This is probably one of the more sad movies I have ever seen. I know a movie is good when I can see it more than once and still be moved. The acting is great, Hurt is totally convincing as Joseph Merrick.(Called John Merrick in the movie). The fact that this movie did not win any Oscars is mind boggling, but what do you expect from the Hollywood elite. They could not allow a new director (Lynch) to get any sort of recognition. Best picture that year went to Ordinary People...??????????? Though the story has been changed a bit, Lynch does a very good job of showing how horrible Merrick's life was. Horrible, yet amazing when you think about the way he has touched so many of us. It is extremely moving watching Merrick react to humane treatment, friendship and love with tears and overwhelming joy. To think a ladies smile and politeness would bring a tear to Merrick's eye is very telling and it give the viewer and idea of how hard his life must of been.
B0002A2WDQ|4.0|Most of the reviews I've read focus on the story based on the VHS edition.  This review will focus on the DVD. <br /> <br />Nothing's changed in the movie (obviously) so I'll only emphasize the main points:  story A, direction B-, acting C (except for Joe Seneca aka Blind Dog Fulton who gets an A), overall A-.  The music is what drives the movie, from the \\"score\\"/soundtrack to the \\"cutting heads\\" at the end.  (WARNING:  the actual soundtrack album does not contain the Steve Vai ending in the movie, which is a shame.  The soundtrack is more like \\"music inspired by the movie.\\") <br /> <br />Differences between the DVD and the VHS versions:  anamorphic widescreen which means the shots are \\"taller\\" where all the characters have that long, slender look about them.  I like it, personally.  Other than that, nothing on the DVD that isn't on the VHS:  no cast bios, no storyboards, no behind-the-scenes, no frills. <br /> <br />Blues fans will buy the DVD just because their VHS copies are all worn out by now.  Other folks might enjoy the movie but probably won't fork out the $20+ for this 80s classic (unless they are die-hard Ralph Karate Kid Macchio fans).
0807282375|5.0|Other reviewers have already put into words how brilliant this finale to His Dark Materials was.   <br /> <br />It is somewhat sad, though I suppose not surprising, that other readers have complained that Pullman did not deliver as promised.  However, it only shows how perfectly subtle the results of the prophecy regarding Lyra are.  I suppose some readers were searching for very cliche-ed betrayal and temptation (were you expecting an apple?).  I thought Pullman did a masterful job bringing the prophecy to fullfillment, and he did even spell it out a little, but not so much that I got the impression he didn't trust readers to figure it out for themselves.  <br /> <br />For those who are still puzzled, the betrayal was leaving Pan behind when Lyra journeyed to the world of the dead.  The temptation was merely the story that Mary Malone told Lyra and Will about her experience of love, which led to the children seeing each other in a different light, and falling in love themselves.  Pullman does not beat you over the head with it, but it is certainly there.   <br /> <br />I am often disappointed by the endings of books, even those of some of my favorite authors, but the ending of His Dark Materials was perfect.  Yes, it was heartbreaking, and you wished it could be otherwise for Lyra and Will, but it was the only way it could have ended.  It would have been too easy for them to live in each others worlds happily ever after.  That would not have been a fitting end for them.  Pullman does not give you what you want at the end of the trilogy, but he gives you what you need.  Anything else would have been superficial.   <br /> <br />I am looking forward to another trilogy from Pullman, following Lyra and Will as they grow up, and journeying with Lyra on her adventure to build the Kingdom of Heaven.
B000025RX4|5.0|Just can't believe that this recording is now over 37 yrs old! At the time  of this record Jimi Hendrix hadn't been long dead. People were looking for a suitable guitarist to fill the void.  Johnny Winter was the man for the job! From start to finish this recording is full of blistering, lightning fast guitar work. I remember when the single Rock 'n'roll Hootchie Koo got released in England.  I was around 13 yrs old and the song blew me away.I had never heard such an attack displayed on six strings and this experience of mine has never been repeated since. I rushed out and bought the l.p. within days of hearing the single. At that same time Johnny Winter was on a tour of England. I had to see him live. When I play the c.d today it still sounds inspirational.  True to say that this not a pure blues c.d as such, but the overall tone of the songs are still very blues based. 'Prodigal Son' and 'Look Up' for instance are essentially 12 bar blues songs given a rock feel. Johnnys voice is superb, especially on the Stevie Winwood poignant ballad No Time To Live. Its an extremely emotional song and fittingly hints at Winters frail health profile at the time.  'Nothing Left' is almost a tune that could've been written by Hendrix. The guitar solo is truly magnificent, similar to the solo on 'Guess I'll Go Away'  psychedelically phased.   The last track, 'Funky Music', contains some of the most inventive guitar work ever.  It's such a shame the track was  faded out because the relentless guitar battle between Winter and Rick Derringer can be heard going into oblivion. Some awesome string bending on this track. There was once Duane Allman & Dicky Betts and there was also  Winter & Derringer. Everything about this recording was superb, even the cover art, which when it was an l.p. stood out quite vividly. Minimalist but very  effective. Back in 1970 nobody looked like or sounded like Johnny Winter. He was unique.   When i purchased the CD the sound quality was flat, tinny and scratchy like it was made in Russia. The LP version sounded far warmer/clearer. I do hope they re-release this one with a more enhanced sound.
B00005Y228|5.0|This is Kylie's American comeback CD that was boosted by the success of the first infectious hit single \\"Can't Get You Out of My Head\\". Here's an overview of the tracks: <br />1)More More More- I liked this song. Starting off the album with a great song that has a great hook and good dance beat. 4/5 <br /> <br />2)Love At First Sight- I absolutely LOVE this song. Another catchy song with a great dance beat. Very fun, very pop. This was her second single off this album. 5/5 <br /> <br />3)Can't Get You Out of My Head- While it is a great pop song, the \\"la la la\\"s can get on your nerves after a while. But, other than that, it is quite a good song with its infectious beat. 4/5 <br /> <br />4)Fever- the title track of this album. One of my faves off this album, great beat, sexy lyrics. 5/5 <br /> <br />5)Give It To Me- Quite short (a little less than 3 minutes), but nevertheless a good song. 4/5 <br /> <br />6)Fragile- Great song! slower than the rest, but it doesn't bring the beat down at all. This is kind of a mystical song and sad in a way. 5/5 <br /> <br />7)Come Into My World- her third and final single off this album. A very infectious song, one of the album's highlights. 5/5 <br /> <br />8)In Your Eyes- I would have to say that this is quite possibly the BEST track on this whole album. Trancy, great lyrics, utilizes Kylie's sultry voice. I don't understand why this wasn't released in the US when it was released everywhere else. 5/5 <br /> <br />9)Dancefloor- The second best track on here. Good lyrics, awesome beat, very disco-y. Great to dance to. 5/5 <br /> <br />10)Love Affair- sexy, sultry, great beat, very good catchy song, quite creative and a great track to dance to. 5/5 <br /> <br />11)Your Love- Guitar driven, relies less on produced sound and more on Kylie's good vocals. Very good song. 4/5 <br /> <br />12)Burning Up- Another one of my fave tracks on this album. starts off slow, then moves in to the beat. 5/5 <br /> <br />BONUS TRACKS!!!!! <br />13)Boy-good beat, not really the best. 3/5 <br />14)Butterfly- I like this song better than the other extra track. Great beat, fun lyrics. 4/5 <br /> <br />Overall, this is a GREAT CD and everyone should go buy it! Kylie really delivered with this CD and she delivered with \\"Body Language\\", let's hope she keeps making great CDs like these for many years to come!
0142004235|4.0|John Steinbeck happens to be my favorite author, and I have to say this book coincides with his notorious skill. Although lengthy, the story never ceases to draw one in. For instance, during the last part of the book, I stayed up all night to finish it. The story is loaded with detail, rich, and very entertaining. The only problem, for me, lies in the ending. I felt I would have liked to know more about a certain relationship that takes place at the end. Also, if you read the book slowly, the ending may confuse you due to the fact that you may forget the meaning of a conversation that took place in the beginning. Even with that said, I still recomend this book to anyone who enjoys Steinbeck. Try reading Travels with Charley in Search of America by Steinbeck, as well. That I give 5 stars.
B00006V9A0|1.0|As you may know, this is a \\"greatest hits\\" compilation. I think I speak for everyone when I ask this very reasonable question: what hits? Nirvana were an underground band that were banned from the mainstream for imitating superior bands like Puddle Of Mudd and putting naked babies on their covers (an act that would be illegal for most normal citizens, but somehow Nerdvana can get away with it). Anyway, how can you have any hits when your stuff doesn't get played anyway? <br /> <br />I think the biggest insult is that the founders of grunge (Puddle Of Mudd) don't even get the respect they deserve, have had way more hits than Nudebabiesvana, and deserve a compilation piece such as this. Thank goodness POM is more popular than this imitation though.
B00005JNEI|5.0|REPUBLICANS FEAR FAHRENHEIT <br /> <br />Republicans are terrified of Michael Moore's movie.  It is because the movie is full of truths that the GOP never wanted to be exposed.  You will see republicans blasting Moore for his weight, his eating habits, and other nonsense but they will be unable to destroy Moore's message.  They will try by using their usual name calling, but they will be unable to erase Bush's seven minute dumbfounded look while he sat in front of a class full of grade school children while he looked at the pictures in the child's book, The Pet Goat.   <br /> <br />Republicans will rant and rave but they can't destroy the truth.  Not this time.  Fahrenheit 9-11 will spell doom to Bush and the corrupt GOP this November.  I hope that Move-On and the Kerry camp use that seven minutes of Bush looking like the dumbest person ever born on earth over and over again.   The airwaves need to be filled with images of Bush looking like the stool pigeon he is.   Bush just sat there, clueless and dumber than a stump.   <br /> <br />Bush's complete lack of leadership is glaringly displayed during each tick of the clock for seven straight minutes in Moore's masterpiece of a movie.   Remember, Bush had already been told about the first plane hitting the WTC building before he entered the classroom and did nothing.  And while Bush was sitting on a stool in the classroom Andy Card came in and told Bush of the second plane striking the second WTC building.  Instead of Bush acting like ANY REAL leader he just sat there on his stool holding the child's color book \\"The Pet Goat\\".  And remember, Bush didn't know if there were just two planes hijacked, or a hundred.  Bush did nothing.  I can safely say that every child in that classroom was more competent than Bush to be President of the United States, and Commander in Chief at that moment.   <br /> <br />Wake up republicans and stop allowing yourselves to be dupes to corrupt GOP propaganda.  Wake up and think for yourselves for the first time in your lives.  Stop putting your corrupt political party above the best interests of the United States of America. <br /> <br />And lastly, BUY MOORE'S FANTASTIC MOVIE, FAHRENHEIT 9/11.  IT IS A MUST SEE FOR EVERY AMERICAN.
B00000K3CR|5.0|this movie is a classic.. it stand the test of time because the story itself is about what we all deal with in life.. growing up and being a kid.. this is one of the only movies that has ever made me cry at the ending it is a touching movie and will take you back to your childhood and the 80's i was a child during the 80's and seeing the toys and the way the kids act back then takes me back to my childhood... a classic movie..
0142000663|3.0|I found this book a compulsive read. An extremely sad journey through it's pages, you just want the journey to end and the book to be over. This book is beatifully written as I knew it would be. The opening chapter is awesomely written and the tragic Joad family are of course wonderful. Despite the critical introduction I never felt preached to and never felt that dialogue from the Joad family was over and above what you'll get from semi-literate, poverty stricken folk.I don't understand why the publishers allowed such a snobby guy to give the introduction which, before I knew it, told me the ending. How stupid can you get? I'd advise you to read the book BEFORE the intro and make your own mind up BEFORE the intro. This book is one of the reasons I love books. It opened up a little world in my mind that I never knew existed in 1930's America. And I keep talking about it to people and comparing it to the world today. Hope you get it.The book is about farm labourers, small-time plot holders who's livelihoods have been taken away by the coming of the tractors and 1930's Depression. These people have been born and brought up to live off the land, ploughing, sewing etc and NOTHING ELSE. So,skill-less,homeless, hungry, desperate and financially broke they migrate West under promises of work in the West and streets lined with Orange trees. Unfortunately, there's half a million people migrating and not nearly enough work. When the family leave Oaklahoma, Buisnessmen use their desperation to bargain down the worth of their lifes belongings and, when they travel they are told early that buisnessmen use the huge numbers of people, and their hunger and desperation, to lower wages. This book made me hate certain aspects of human nature-competition, survival of the fittest, progress etc. But you will love and admire the Joad family.<br />  In all, an intense beautifully written story that had me hungry for every word.
B00005JMXX|1.0|Even if the SFX were exceptional the scientific basis was lacking. At some points it was even unbelievable. It seems that the law of thermodynamics need not apply nor plain common sense. <br />The taxi scene was the most awful as well as the total freezing sequences. Can it be colder than outer space? <br />This movie was a total deception. Now who will take global warming seriously? <br />We didn't need to have this global apocalypse to show the consequences of global warming. Just have a look at the weather channel. It has already begun and it is only the very beginning. So beware it's going to get worse. <br />If you to be entertained go see the movie but don't expect too much of it. It is a pure fantasy.
B0000027RL|1.0|Ah, the infamous grunge genre. It has became legendary for it's popularity, and unfortunately, for it's great amount of rip-off artists. It's a very sad time for all grunge fans because there are so many imitators out there, which make me believe that grunge may be dieing. Just like Nirvana and Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam is no different. <br /> <br />First, their name is terrible. Jam doesn't do anyone any good and is a measly food for measly people. I guess these guys are just all out of creativity. This brings me to my next point, these guys were obviously inspired by grunge masters Staind and have copied their sound to the very core. To sum it up, this is just terrible and you can't even understand what the vocalist is saying half the time!!
B00005A46T|4.0|A bunch of guys in masks playing relentlessly at each show, a few jump around on stage and beat the crap out of each other, the crowd is at their command and throw middle fingers in the air.  I dunno whether to be amazed or shocked in disgust, but all I know is, I enjoyed the music of their self-titled album. Hearing that album brought me to listening to heavy metal more often and brought me to appreciate the likes of Pantera, Metallica ('80s stuff), Slayer, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, etc., and I have nine freaks to thank for that. <br /> <br />That was 1999, and I was a Freshman in high school. And for 2 short years, I've waited patiently for what these maniacs would bring for their fellow maggots to feed off next. I've heard Shawn Crahan (the clown) joked around about their next album being more rap oriented (which at first had me worried, but then realized that *duh!* it was a JOKE). And ever since seeing their somewhat updated masks and jumpsuits made me think that \\"Iowa\\" was gonna be a much darker album. The release date was approaching, the month was August, and I was just in my early stages of my Junior year of high school. <br /> <br />After school one day, I went out and bought this album. I played it and was completely surprised by its sound. Gone are the rap-metalness of their self-titled album (well, most of it anyway) and in are the sounds that would truly make Slipknot heavy metal. <br /> <br />\\"Iowa\\" came as darker and apocalyptic than what they've done before. \\"People=S**t\\" is the new \\"Surfacing.\\" \\"My Plague\\" is a surprising addition. Like what \\"Wait and Bleed\\" did, this song shows us that Corey (#8) isn't just a mindless and screaming vocalist, but an incredible singer. And above all, the lyrics deal more with death and, in some wierd ways, necrophilia (EX: \\"I wanna slit your throat and f*** the wound\\"), and also deals with loss and insanity. <br /> <br />In some ways, \\"Iowa\\" is better than \\"Slipknot.\\" Corey has more moments where he actually sings,and the lyrics have a bit more meaning, but it doesn't deliver the anger and fast-paced metal that \\"Slipknot\\" offered. And \\"Iowa\\" might've signaled that Slipknot are becoming softer, or more like Stone Sour, which have probably alienated more fans. But there comes a point in a band's life when they gotta take change or experiment a little. Maybe Korn can take that advice. <br /> <br />Both albums (Iowa and the self-titled one) still continue to amaze me once in a while. To me, one is not better than the other. And I've yet to hear \\"Vol. 3: The Subliminal Verses,\\" but from what I've heard... yes, they sound a bit too much like Stone Sour.

B0001CCXY8|4.0|How could you not simply adore a band that writes such melodic tunes as \\"Necropedophile\\", or \\"Fxxked With a Knife\\"?!? Or even dislike the lovely pleasent-imaged \\"Force-fed Broken Glass\\"? A stoopidhead, thats who wouldn't! Cannibal Corpse is not for people who have little tolerance, or have just eaten. Corpsegrinder (The new lead singer for CC, after Chris Barnes left) writes some of the most interesting lyrics I have ever read! I have a hobby of blasting this out of my stereo when some conservative Christian old-folk come over; and thats the hottest fxxking thing! The album-artwork is astonishing. It deserves to be put in a museum! Grindcore, Deathmetal, or Speedmetal fans should check this out; or sustain your sissy-school-boy image. L8'R!

0743454529|3.0|This book was well written with a very intriguing premise; should 13 year old Anna, who was conceived as a cord blood donor for her older, leukemia stricken sister, have the right to make her own decisions about continuing to assist her sister medically?<br /><br />This book held my interest up to the conclusion, which was a complete disappointment and a bit of a cop-out.  **WARNING**  Stop reading here if you haven't read the book or don't want to read a mild spoiler.<br /><br />Something extremely improbable happens at the end of the story, which renders the entire question of Anna's medical rights moot.  Note to the author - anyone with the medical condition of one of the characters involved in the incident after Anna's last court appearance would not be allowed to have a driver's license.  I felt incredibly cheated by this ending, although it certainly allowed the writer to tie everything up neatly.

B00005Q4CS|5.0|requiem for a dream is a movie that draws the audience in and glues them to the lives of the main charachters..the plot is about dreams and how sometimes they fail and things dont happen as we want , and the after effects of the failure of our quest to achieve our dreams.  Requiem for a dream is a very touching movie, the music fits perfectly with the atmosphere of the film and captures each moment perfectly. The camera work is also superb, the director uses certain camera angles to capture the feeling of drug usage, anxiety, and depression in a way that is intelligently artistic.  This movie is an absolute stroke of genius. In requiem for a dream we are introduced to 4 characters, harry(mrs goldfarbs son, marions boyfriend, and tyrones best friend), marion(harrys girlfriend), mrs goldfarb(harrys mother), and tyrone(harrys best friend) played by jared letto, jeniffer conelly, elain burnsty, maryln wayans.  Each of the main characters each have dreams and means in which to reach them..the main charachter harry sets out to help his girlfriend to be free from her parents grasp and the grasp of others that are doing nothing but giving her money and loaning to her, by coppin an ounce of pure to fund for her to be able to open her own clothing shop. He sets out with his friend tryone on a quest to achieve that dream that leads them through a breath taking finish.. also in the movie mrs goldfarb goes through alot to reach her own dreams..    all i have to say to you is that this movie is absolutely excellent, every shot,every second, every frame of this movie is absolutely perfect..it is a sad movie yes but the movie starts out with excitement and hope just like one has when they are trying to reach a dream..    an absolute fabulous movie.. i recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys cinema this is one for the ages    ******HOWEVER LIKE ONE OTHER REVIEWER SAID.. I DONT THINK ANYONE SHOULD GET THIS COPY OF THE MOVIE.. THIS IS THE R RATED COPY.. THE ORIGINAL REQUIEM FOR A DREAM FILM IS UNRATED AND IS FOR A REASON, DONT SELL YOURSELF SHORT AND GET THE RATED VERSION, CALL YOUR LOCAL MOVIE STORES AND FIND OUT IF THEY HAVE THE UNRATED VERSION.. BECAUSE ANY  EDIT TO THIS MOVIE WILL ONLY RUIN THIS MASTERPIECE******
0156027321|5.0|This book is great.  While there are a couple of parts that are not for the squeamish, I would say that overall it is well-written and believable enough to make you wonder if it was based on a true story.  My usual fare is science fiction and LoTR-type fantasy, but I was looking for something different and more intellectual.  This book hit the spot, so to speak.     If you are a fundamentalist of any religion, you will probably not enjoy this book as much as if you're open-minded.  It's meant to make you think.
B0002A2WDQ|3.0|Plot summaries of this movie abound, so I won't rehash them. The movie is wonderful, but the long-awaited DVD issue is disappointing. It is in widescreen and the transfer quality is fine, but it has no extras and only a two-channel soundtrack. <br /> <br />While it's worth buying anyway, a 5.1 soundtrack and a good commentary would have really made it a great deal.

0141301155|5.0|What kid doesn't love chocolate?  <br />This story takes kids on an imaginative romp behind the scenes at a chocolate factory. <br />First, the children ache right along with Charlie as he deals with his poverty and with his hopes of discovering the golden ticket.  Then, children experience the joys and thrills and wonder of seeing the magical, wondrous, surreal chocolate factory at work.  The Oompaloompas, the chocolate waterfall, the just desserts handed to each kid--it's all wonderful, imaginative, fun, outrageous, and it just so happens to teach a few little moral lessons as well. <br />A great book for reading aloud to your children; it's as much fun as you can experience in a novel. <br />This is one of those books that routinely top children's book lists time and time again.
0060537639|4.0|1421 is an interesting read, but it does make some leaps in histeriography.  It immediately reminded me of America, BC which contends that the ancient Celts came over to New England and inland to present day West Virginia and Missouri.   <br />While the historical aspect needs further research, the thesis is possible.  The evidence specifically for the Sacramento River settlements is intriguing, but one would expect more physical evidence than what has been discovered. <br />While I would not stake my academic life on this book, it does give some insight on cultural diffusion and the idea of pre-Columbian exploration in the Americas.
B0001CNRS4|2.0|**1/2 Credit \\"Honey\\" with at least having its heart in the right place - even if its brain isn't always so easy to find.  The ever sunny and optimistic Honey Daniels holds down two jobs in her increasingly hectic life - a bartender by night and a hip hop dance instructor by day.  She has hopes of one day appearing in a music video, a dream that comes true when she catches the eye of a big time producer named Michael Ellis.  Not only is Honey a smash in her first video appearance, but Michael immediately hires her as choreographer for one of his projects.  As is typical in these strive-and-succeed tales, Honey soon discovers that success is not all that it's cracked up to be when Michael reveals his true colors, setting up conditions for her continued employment that she hadn't quite counted on (in other words, \\"put out or pull out\\").  But the always-undaunted Honey is not about to be knocked down that easily.  She uses this little setback to start thinking less about herself and more about the street kids whom she sees turning into drug dealers and gangsters right before her rose-colored eyes.  Filled with a righteous zeal and determination, she rallies the neighborhood to raise money for a new dance studio that can get the youngsters off the street, channel their energies in a more positive direction, and turn their lives around.<br /><br />Only the most Scrooge-like curmudgeon could object to the positive, laudatory, pull-yourself-up-by-the-bootstraps message the film is trying to convey, and one would have to be downright inhuman not to feel uplifted by the final dance sequence.  But good intentions and noble aspirations do not, in and of themselves, make for a quality film, and \\"Honey\\" is a long way from fitting that bill.  The movie wants to be taken seriously as a realistic view of urban life but very little of what we see ever rings true, starting with Honey herself who, with her invariably perky demeanor, seems like a cross between Little Mary Sunshine and Mother Teresa in form fitting jeans and matching halter top.  Everything that happens to her - from her meteoric rise in the music video world to her purchase of an empty store for her new dance studio to the benefit performance she and her dancers stage to raise the money for the project - all come about way too easily and with virtually no noticeable effort on her part.  We never believe for a moment that any of this would happen in this way in the real world.  Thus, \\"Honey\\" is really little more than an urban fairy tale, fine for children, I suppose, but not of much use for adults with a more pragmatic understanding of how life actually works.<br /><br />Jessica Alba is no great shakes as an actress, though she has an infectious smile and a bubbly demeanor that work well on screen.  But it is Zachary Williams, as the adorable, gap-toothed eight-year-old Raymond, who steals the show.  Now that is one hell of an endearing little kid.y Sunshine and Mother Teresa in form fitting jeans and matching halter top.

B0002DRDBE|5.0|I loved this movie! I worked as a clerk for over 15 years and honest to god have met every single one of the customers in this movie (some of them more than once). I loved the conversations between Dante and Randall. You don't have to have non-stop action to have a good movie. When I first saw it I was still working in retail and laughed so hard I thought I was going to be sick. I loved the DVD version which has the original ending. (Won't give it away if you haven't seen it). I thought that the original ending would have been better. Just that extra punctuation to the day. If you want to understand the person behind the counter the next time you go to the store see this movie. If you are the person behind the counter see this movie. You'll be glad you did the next time the village idiot walks in your store. Either way though Clerks is a must see and I can't wait to get this 10th anniversary pack
0141301120|4.0|This is a good book.  I enjoyed following the Bucket family (eventually EVERYONE gets aboard, even the bed), after Charlie wins the factory.  Crazy things continue to happen. Analogies to real life, imaginative things, and bizarre things continue to be pictured before your eyes. <br />Books like this are fun to read aloud to your children or to any kid.  <br />I docked the book one point only because the beginning is a bit slow and because it's not quite as fun as the chocolate factory.

B00008973Q|5.0|After reading many of the negative reviews on Amazon concerning the DVD transfer of Ran, I expected problems when I watched the DVD on my 32\\" flat screen TV.  The Masterworks Edition is the only version of Ran I have seen and I was not disappointed with the quality of the transfer.  Of course, I need to see the film as it was intended to be seen by Kurosawa to fully understand the criticisms of the many experts who have complained about the various tenchical inadequacies of the Masterworks Edition of the film.<br /><br />Additionally, several reviewers have complained about anachronisms such as rifles being used before they were invented.  Others suggest that Ran is a poor adaptation of King Lear, the play on which Ran is based.  Many anachronisms can be found in Shakespeare's plays.  This inaccuracy does not lessen the value of the work.  Also, I did not expect to see a perfect adaptation of King Lear.  Instead, I was interested in Kurosawa's artistic vision of the classic themes in one of Shakespeare's greatest plays. Ran, like King Lear, is complex and one viewing will not be enough to understand completely what happens in the film.  A brief synopsis of the plot follows.<br /><br />An aging Japanese war lord decides to divide up his kingdom among his three sons.  His oldest and middle son accept the gift, but the youngest son argues against the old man giving up his power and authority.  The youngest son is banished and the two older sons quickly turn against their father and force him to leave his castle to fend for himself by living off the land.  The father is astonished by this unhappy turn of events and he goes to war against his sons, losing his entire guard, wife, concubines, and servants.  He is left with only a court jester and a faithful retainer to help him survive.<br /><br />Ran, like King Lear, is a tragedy from first to last and my brief sketch only suggests important elements of the plot.  Whom can we trust?  Certainly not those people who appear to be friends, but have their own interest at heart and who are willing to betray us to further their own interests.  Those who disagree with us, often at great risk and personal sacrifice, may be the people we can count on for support in difficult times.<br /><br />The War Lord tries to understand the total disaster that leaves him desolate.  His gods do not help him.  Like Job, he discovers that it is impossible to understand God's ways to man.  Also like Job, he is completely ruined even though he thinks he has done the right thing.<br /><br />Kurosawa is one of the great directors of the 20th Century and Ran is one of his best films.  Highly recommented.their own interest at heart and who are willing to betray us to further their own interests.

0786880708|5.0|The messages in this book, the significancy of mindfulness, resonated so strongly in me it is as if the author wrote it specifically to me. Kabat-Zinn's writing style, knowledge and common sense attitude were refreshing in a world that often to me seems full of New Age mysticism. His advice that it is &quot;best to meditate without advertising it&quot; made me holler, &quot;Hallelujah!&quot;
B00018D3JQ|1.0|This is horrible. Absolutely f***ing horrible. Take post-punk/synth pop classics and put them through a shredder/blender of bossanova and 60s pop and what have you got? A total mess. Currently being hyped as an \\" album that would melt any cold post punk's heart.\\" Which is complete rubbish. This is sacrilege of the highest degree. Now if people get into Joy Division and Depeche Mode because of this - that's all very well and I welcome anyone on board. But please, this CD is an insult to those classics. Some may see it as a good idea ( and I admit it does have a good nice novelty factor ) but when you strip away the novelty factor what you have is a very shallow record devoid of the emotion that was put into the original recordings ( OK I'll be the first one to admit that there's not much emotion in DM's happy-clappy Just Can't Get Enough ).  <br /> <br />Call me a musical purist if you will but some things should never be tampered with
B000002TQV|5.0|Radiohead's debut album, \\"Pablo Honey\\", was not exactly a classic..but it did show some promise for the band. Granted, not to the point where it screamed \\"This band will be hailed as genius in 5 years\\", but it was decent. On their follow-up, \\"The Bends\\", they fine tuned their sound to create an intelligent, dark (but highly accessible) album that's a definite improvement over their identity searching debut.     The atmospheric sound effects and reverb laded piano chords that kick off the opening song \\"Planet Telex\\" serve as the perfect intro. In fact, the whole song has an earthy feel to it, yet remains catchy and anthematic.     The title track sees the band rock out a bit, but unlike the somewhat bland, angsty rockers from \\"Pablo Honey\\", this shows a more confident, stronger band, both lyrically and musically. \\"Bones\\" is another rocker that combines Thom Yorke's distraught lyrics with heavy guitars and a catchy, instantly memorable chorus.     \\"Just\\" is another superb tune with some really cool sounding guitar work, and yet another heavy but anthematic chorus that'll stick in your head. \\"My Iron Lung\\" is a response to the success of \\"Creep\\", as Thom Yorke sings, \\"This is our new song, same as the last one, a total waste of time for everyone\\". It's a killer song with alien-like guitar textures in the verses, and a cathartic, indecipherable chorus.     If you're a fan of slower stuff, don't fret. \\"High & Dry\\" is a nice mid-tempo tune that mixes accoustic verses with an electric chorus that shows off Thom's angelic voice. \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\" is simplicity at its best; a largely accoustic ballad with more beautiful vocal work from Thom. The song contains some of his most poignant lyrics, and remains one of the most beloved Radiohead songs to this day. The theatrical \\"Nice Dream\\" is also along these lines.      Other favorites of mine include the gloomy-but-gorgeous \\"Bulletproof...I Wish I Was\\", the mid-tempo rocker/ballad \\"Black Star\\", and the haunting closer, \\"Street Spirit (Fade Out)\\". The latter also has some of Thom's best lyrics (relating to death), set to a backdrop of foreboding guitar harmonics. The song builds up to the finale in which Thom sings, \\"Immerse your soul in love\\", a dramatic ending to a wonderful album.     I'm tempted to say this is a 4.5 star album, because the follow-up to this album, \\"OK Computer\\", is even worlds beyond this. And that's saying a lot, because \\"The Bends\\" is a definite classic of the 90's. It's the first masterpiece for a band who'd continue to defy musical logic and get better and better. If you're a new fan, start here - you won't be disappointed.    Best Songs: Street Spirit (Fade Out), Bulletproof, Black Star, Fake Plastic Trees, My Iron Lung.
B00005JNEI|5.0|First of all, this is not a mere propaganda film based on fiction to enrage the public. It is based on fact. Fact confirmed by the United States 9/11 Commission. <br /> <br />This is an excellent movie regardless of your political views. Republicans say they hate this movie before seeing it, because it is against President George Bush. Everyone should be open to the truth. Not against it because of their political offiliation. <br /> <br />This is a must see for all people.
B00005JNJT|4.0|This movie will most likely be good. There is one bad part though. The batmobile completely sucks. It looks like a pimped up range rover. I think any of the old ones are better than this. The movie does have two really good villians though, Ras Ah Gauhl played by Ken Wantanbe and The Scarecrow played by Cillian Murphy. THe story is about Bruce Wayne played by Christian Bale becoming Batman. When he returns to Gotham it is corrupt and the Scarecrow is terrorizing the city. Bruce went on a trip and Ras offered him to join him. Bruce learned what Ras' plans were and declined. He went back to Gotham and then startedd to become Batman with the help of Lucious Fox played by Morgan Freeman.
B00001X590|5.0|WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS is an exceptional debut from Joe Cocker. It contains a wonderful mix of covers and a few originals, and the title cut rips the Beatles' original to shreds any day. Also not to be missed is Cocker's rendition of \\"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\\", sung to sound like it's coming from an at-heart pacifist who occasionally loses his cool on other people. Pointing out other highlights is pointless, as this album should be taken as a whole.
B000002N2Z|4.0|\\"Adrenaline\\" was actually the last Deftones album I heard, so naturally it was a bit of a let down for someone used to the rich atmosphere of \\"White Pony\\", sonic metal of \\"Deftones\\", and the utter masterpiece that is \\"Around the Fur\\". But disregarding how good they'd become a few years later, \\"Adrenaline\\" is a strong debut from the Deftones; think of it mostly as nu-metal that doesn't suck, with a touch of things to come.    The opening track \\"Bored\\" begins with a sinister guitar riff, and ranges from quiet verses (in which vocalist Chino Moreno sings softly) to the heavy, anthematic chorus (which is the first taste of Chino's trademark piercing scream).     \\"Minus Blindfold\\" and \\"One Weak\\" are both similar fare that build metal guitar riffs around the soft/loud dynamics. The former has a couple tempo changes, and is one of my favorites on here. The Korn-like \\"Nosebleed\\" is largely forgettable, and my least favorite track on the album.    On the other hand, \\"Lifter\\" is my favorite. Tense verses explode into a heavy chorus, which lead into the bridge - a barrage of layered guitars that hint at the more textured soundscapes of their later work. Likewise, \\"Birthmark\\" is another fantastic song without a touch of the nu-metal style rapping that is present on many of these songs. The chorus is the most memorable on the album, as Chino reaches a spine-tingling pitch.     The best of the nu-metal style tracks are placed back to back: \\"Root\\" and \\"7 Words\\". The former is an aggressive onslaught that culminates in another soaring vocal performance from Chino, proving again that he's vastly more talented when he tries to sing, as opposed to the speed talking/rapping. The latter is pretty brilliant in its raw simplicity. The lyrics in the verses are indecipherable, but the chorus certainly isn't: \\"SUCK! SUCK! SUCK! SUCK! SUCK!..\\" etc. Believe me, it works. The epitome of adrenaline.    The bizarrely titled \\"Engine #9\\" is another case of a \\"good nu-metal\\" song. Sure, you can't really understand Chino, but the song has arguably the best riff on the album, and it's totally hypnotic in its unrelenting aggression.    Clocking in at nearly 7 minutes, \\"Fireal\\" is one of the Deftones' longer songs, and probably the most experimental thing on here. The main riff is in 7/4, whereas everything else on the album is pretty much in standard 4/4. It's a tense, almost eerie song; the pre-chorus features a distorted ghost-like scream from Chino. There's also a hidden track after it (an actual track, you don't have to fast forward to it) called \\"Fist\\". It's the softest song on here, and showcases the band's Cure-influenced love of atmospheric music. The later addition of turntablist Frank Delgado, along with their musical maturation, would allow them to heavily explore this sound on subsequent albums.    Overall, \\"Adrenaline\\" is an interesting listen as it showcases two different bands. One influenced by aggressive Bad Brains style punk/metal, and another influenced by the moody, layered stylings of The Cure and The Smiths. The majority of the album falls into the former category, giving it an early nu-metal feel. However, unlike crappy Limp Bizkit nu-metal, this is much more sophisticated. Still, the best songs on here are the few that fall into the latter category, in which the band creates a more mature sound, and Chino relies on his naturally beautiful singing voice. A highly recommended listen.    Best Songs: Lifter, Birthmark, Fireal, Engine #9, 7 Words.
B00006RAKP|5.0|It took me awhile to buy this cd set,though i wished id gotten it sooner.Elton's voice makes you listen to these songs,whether you like the music or not.Everbody knows at least 3 good songs of his.The harmonies to the songs are just amazing.The part i didnt like to this set was the orignal versions of \\"Candle In The Wind\\" and \\"Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me\\". Because of always hearing the live versions on radio.But after playing them a few times im glad they are on here.I know some people are saying wheres this song,wheres that song.I think the basis of this set means THE GREATEST HITS OF ELTON JOHN.Meaning these are his biggest of the biggest hits.It best suits any casual fan or thee fan.Nice booklet in digi pak....though not fan of them packages.

B000001ELL|3.0|Kiss released the Dynasty album in 1979. At this time, the band, despite their success, was going through turmoil. Chemical dependencies were getting the best of Peter Criss so much that his drumming suffered tremendously which led to his exit from the band. Meanwhile, Ace Frehley,  fresh from having the most successful of the band's recently released solo albums, was getting restless and wanted to pursue a solo career. This is also the album where Kiss became more of a pop band rather than a heavy rock band which would ultimately lead to the biggest creative and sales slump of their career.<br /><br />Simply told, this album is a tale of two halves. The album's first half is top notch. The band would dive headfirst into disco with  Paul Stanley's \\"I Was Made For Lovin' You\\" which would not only become one of the band's biggest hits but also one of the best songs of the genre. Their cover of the Rolling Stones' \\"2000 Man\\" featuring vocals from Frehley is easily their best cover song. The should have been second hit single \\"Sure Know Something\\" is the best track here featuring great vocals from Stanley and the coolest bass line that Gene Simmons would ever compose. Peter  Criss' \\"Dirty Livin'\\" is the funkiest song they'd ever record and is also a strong track. Then we get to the second and much weaker half of the album. Gene Simmons' tunes \\"X-Ray Eyes\\" and especially \\"Charisma\\" don't really go anywhere. Stanley's \\"Magic Touch\\" isn't very good either save for the cool guitar riff. Only Frehley's tunes \\"Hard Times\\" and \\"Save Your Love\\" are decent and they still don't touch the great tracks from the album's first half. Also worth noting is that while this album is uneven, it sounds like Destroyer when compared to their next album Unmasked which was their weakest release. If you really love the album's first half, it's worth picking up. Aside from Dirty Livin', the remaining strong tracks \\"2000 Man\\" and \\"Sure Know Something\\" are featured on their Unplugged album and \\"I Was Made For Lovin' You\\" is available on several of their best-of albums such as The Very Best Of Kiss and 20th Century Masters: The Millenium Collection.For Lovin' You\\" is available on several of their best-of albums such as The Very Best Of Kiss and 20th Century Masters: The Millenium Collection.
B000069AUI|5.0|It may be fashionable to bash Coldplay now, since they've become massively popular and what not. But really, I don't see the need. Coldplay is not a corporately manufactured band. They're just a bunch of guys from the UK who make good, catchy pop music. They released a couple of really great songs, and became popular because of it. While not the most innovative band on the planet, they gained success because what they do, they do perfectly. Anyway, \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" is obviously their breakthrough album. Not only is it more melodic and catchy than their debut, \\"Parachutes\\", it's much stronger musically. <br /> <br />\\"Politik\\" is quite intense for Coldplay, who typically keep things pretty mellow or quiet. It's a tense song with pounding piano chords and big drums. Like one of their major influences, U2, they're a socially conscious band, and the lyrics in the song demand, \\"Open up your eyes\\" and \\"Give me love over this\\". <br /> <br />The first single, \\"In My Place\\", is a bittersweet, soulful, romantic pop song. Likewise, \\"The Scientist\\" is a romantic, piano led ballad that I'm sure we've all heard before. It's simple enough that a novice piano player could pick it up in about a half hour, but it's effective. Music doesn't need to be complex to be good, and this is evidence. <br /> <br />\\"God Put a Smile On Your Face\\", a mid-tempo rocker that recalls Bends-era Radiohead, has arguably the best hook on the album. I'm surprised it didn't make a bigger splash on the radio. <br /> <br />\\"Clocks\\" was another big hit from the album. The shimmering piano arpeggios that make up the main melody also falls into the category \\"simple, but effective\\". The upbeat, mid-paced tempo perfectly masks the somewhat despair ridden lyrics. <br /> <br />\\"Daylight\\" is lush, dream pop that layers strings, pianos, guitars, and percussion. It's an uplifting song, with a disco like beat. Another standout is the minimalistic folk/pop of \\"Green Eyes\\". <br /> <br />\\"Warning Sign\\" is yetanother simple, but beautiful ballad. The melancholy lyrics are delivered angelically by vocalist Chris Martin, specifically during the outro in which he sings, \\"So I crawl back into your arms\\" repeatedly. <br /> <br />An anxious, repetitve riff makes up \\"A Whisper\\", the most forgettable tune on the album for me, but certainly not bad by any means. Next up is the wonderful title track, whose slow, haunting verses pave the way for a soaring, majestic chorus. <br /> <br />Finally, there's the final and best song on the album, \\"Amsterdam\\" - a chilling piano ballad in which Chris Martin sings, \\"My star is fading\\". The lyrics illustrate a depressed, near suicide state (with occasionally glimpses of hope). The song builds and builds to its climax, where the guitars/percussion blasts in, and culminates with Martin singing, \\"Stuck on the edge, tied to a noose, but you came along and cut my loose..\\" <br /> <br />Even though their hip factor to musical elitists may have decreased (especially after being plugged by Justin Timberlake as one of his favorite bands), Coldplay is a great band. And \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" is one of the best 'sophisticated pop' albums in recent memory. Don't hate them for being popular. <br /> <br />Best Songs: Amsterdam, A Rush of Blood to the Head, Daylight, A Warning Sign, Clocks. <br /> <br />
B00005JMUA|1.0|First let me say that I loved Kill Bill Vol.1.  I saw it five times at the movies, own it on DVD and watch it alot!<br /><br />Now, let me follow this up by saying I have no clue why people are raving so much about the second volume.<br /><br />COMPARED TO VOLUME 1, IT'S NOT A GOOD MOVIE!<br /><br />Volume 1 had action, violence, mystery, martial arts, and superb dialogue.  The Bride (Uma) fought her way through the first two members of the Deadly Vipers Assassination Squad (including a tour de force martial arts battle in the House of Blue Leaves).  This is all meant to build us to the conclusion when The Bride meets the final three (and supposedly most deadly members of her old squad) including the frightening mastermind known as BILL.<br /><br />WRONG!<br /><br />WRONG!<br /><br />Nothing happens!  The Bride dispatches the last members way too quickly (so there goes our action), she fools around with Bill who turns out to be a normal joe (how exactly did he run a squad of hitmen or have ties to the Japanese underworld?), and there is tons of LAME dialogue spouted about Superman while making sandwiches.<br /><br />Did I mention that Volume 2 has the most anti-climatic ending in the history of action movies?  If you've seen the previews you've seen the ENTIRE FIGHT!<br /><br />Now I know Tarantino has a huge following, heck I'm one of them.  But if he set out to make a great action movie and homage to martial arts films he got it half right.<br /><br />Kill Bill Volume 1 = A+<br /><br />Kill Bill Volume 2 - D-
B0000C0FJB|5.0|Although Rush has released five live albums in their career, Rush In Rio is certainly the best of the lot. Like their previous live album Different Stages, it's much more representative of their live show than their other live albums because the material spans their entire career rather than a particular point in their career. Also unlike many live albums which sound obviously doctored in the studio, the sound quality is kept pretty raw here and that combined with a wild crowd of 40,000 fans in Rio de Janeiro make this the next best thing to seeing Rush live.<br /><br />While the production is not so polished, it takes nothing away from the incredible musicianship of the band. Geddy Lee's bass is way up in the mix even if his vocals are sometimes drowned out by the crowd on their most popular tracks. Alex Lifeson's playing remains impressive and is downright volcanic on the newer material from the Vapor Trails album. And Neil Peart is amazing as usual, still the best drummer in rock. The song selection is very well thought out as it balances their most popular tracks with a healthy dose of tracks from their later albums, particularly Roll The Bones and Vapor Trails. The timeless tracks \\"The Trees\\", \\"New World Man\\", \\"Limelight\\", \\"Free Will\\", \\"2112\\", and \\"Tom Sawyer\\" all sound amazing here and are more energetic than their studio versions. \\"Closer To The Heart\\", a track which the band rarely perfomed on this tour, also sounds great. The tracks from the synth era, \\"Distant Early Warning\\", \\"Red Sector A\\", and especially \\"The Big Money\\" are much stronger here than the live versions on A Show Of Hands. The band absolutely chugs like a locomotive on the newer tracks \\"One Little Victory\\", \\"Secret Touch\\", \\"Earthshine\\", and \\"Driven.\\" The lesser known tracks \\"Between Sun And Moon\\" and \\"The Pass\\" are also a nice surprise. There is also an excellent acoustic version of \\"Resist\\" and a fantastic drum solo from Neil Peart, \\"O Baterista\\", which pays homage to legendary jazz drummer Buddy Rich at its outro. Other classic tracks here include the epic \\"Natural Science\\", the early favorites \\"By-Tor & The Snow Dog\\" and \\"Working Man\\" and the instrumentals \\"YYZ\\" and \\"La Villa Strangiato\\" on which the rabid crowd actually sings with note for note! This is a fantastic album that all Rush fans should own.ch at its outro.

B000002UJQ|5.0|Radiohead's \\"OK Computer\\" is one of those rare albums that actually lives up to the hype surrounding it. It certainly did for me at least. Sure, I love \\"The Bends\\", but I don't think the band really stepped into 'genius' territory until this album. Like \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" two decades earlier, \\"OK Computer\\" is a wildly experimental masterpiece that pessimisstictly explores our modern society.  <br /> <br />The opening cut, \\"Airbag\\", is a glorious 5 minute orchestra of thick layered guitars and pounding percussion. Heavily atmospheric, as is the whole album. <br /> <br />\\"Paranoid Android\\" is a 6 minute epic with multiple tempo changes, ranging from mid-tempo, melancholy guitar strumming, heavy/angry guitar rock, to heavenly chanting. Despite its length, it was one of the singles culled from the album, and is an absolute classic. You gotta hear it to believe it. <br /> <br />\\"Subterranean Homesick Alien\\" is a personal favorite of mine that typically doesn't get as much recognition as I think it deserves. The guitar work is magnificent - layered to create a glowing, dreamy soundscape. If the aliens play jazz music on Mars or Venus, this is what it sounds like.  <br /> <br />\\"Exit Music (For a Film)\\" is one of Radiohead's most haunting, chilling ballads. It has a neo-gothic feel to it, beginning with a stark accoustic guitar, and slowly building up into the grand finale which you can hear for yourself. <br /> <br />\\"Let Down\\" is a bittersweet mid-tempo song that, again, layers atmospheric guitars with thick bass and hypnotic drums to create something that totally encapsulates you. Quite beautiful and moving, it's not hard to see why it's a huge fan favorite. <br /> <br />\\"Karma Police\\" is primarily a piano-led song; it's very brooding and theatrical as it builds up to the outro. It segues into \\"Fitter Happier\\", which sounds like some sort of Stephen Hawking nightmare with the robotic voice and eerie piano in the background. <br /> <br />\\"Electioneering\\" explores crooked politics, and is musically the most straightforward song on here: Loud guitars and thunderous percussion. Some feel that it disrupts the flow of the album, which is a valid point, but it's still a good song, especially if you like to hear Radiohead rock out. <br /> <br />\\"Climbing Up The Walls\\" creates a nocturnal atmosphere, and still remains the creepiest, most haunting Radiohead song with its thick amplified bass and distorted, horrified vocals. <br /> <br />\\"No Surprises\\", on the other hand, is one of their most peaceful sounding songs. Using a toy guitar and xylophone for the melody, the song sounds like a nursery rhyme. It contains some of Thom's greatest lyrics, and is really uplifting, despite the fact that it's not an upbeat message.  <br /> <br />\\"Lucky\\" is another great piece of music in which the band alternates tense, slow building verses with a sweeping, anthematic chorus.  <br /> <br />Finally, \\"The Tourist\\", probably my favorite Radiohead song of all time. Like \\"Subterranean Homesick Alien\\", it's an ethereal, otherworldly musical landscape. The chorus shimmers with its rich, textured guitar effects. A beautiful closer to the album. <br /> <br />Make no mistake about it, \\"OK Computer\\" is a masterpiece of the modern era. It may not be as instantly accessible as \\"The Bends\\", but you'll grow to appreciate it even more with repeated listens. The music is dense and layered, so it's impossible to uncover everything right away. If you don't own this album already, I strongly urge you to purchase it. No record collection is complete without it. <br /> <br />Best Songs: The Tourist, Paranoid Android, Subterranean Homesick Alien, Exit Music (For a Film), No Surprises. <br />
B0000296SI|5.0|Alright, I've been listening to this album for quite some time (un-edited version of course, but i found the comment in the edited section so i thought i'd tear it apart hear, rather than in the other place) To quote precisely: \\"These guys play about as well as a garage band. They have very basic skills. The guitar playing especially blows. A blind monkey could play better than these guys. As for the songwriting, it seems to be the work of 8th graders. Absolutely juvenile.\\" Wow you have got to be kidding me. Blink sold out a bit with the Edited versions, i must admit, but to say they have basic skills when i doubt very honestly that you could play half the stuff they can anywhere near the speed. And as for calling them a garage band, you must not be a Weezer fan, or you must just be a total dumbass. As for being juvenile, that was the whole intention of Blink-182 in the first place. If this isn't your kind of music, just say you dont like it, dont go bashing the people who do like it and dont make fun of the musicians, even if you can play better than them (highly unlikely in your particular case). If they sucked, they wouldnt have so many CD's and they wouldn't be as popular. Keep that in mind
B0001DI0FI|5.0|This is the best movie about a boat thing. Its special effect are great and it is cool. The only bad part is the kid with one arm. In the begining and end there is a fight. If you like boats you should watch this movie.
B0001Z52RU|4.0|\\"If a butterfly flaps its wings on one side of the world, the ripple effect could cause a tempest on the other.\\" --Chaos Theory    Starting off with a quote of the Chaos Theory. Background info about the quote and theory. \\"The flapping of a single butterfly's wing today produces a tiny change in the state of the atmosphere. Over a period of time, what the atmosphere actually does diverges from what it would have done\\" (Ian Stewart, Does God Play Dice? The Mathematics of Chaos, pg. 141). So the movie is relating to the idea that a small, unseemingly insignificant action would cause drastic changes in the future.    Ashton Kutcher plays a college student who had intermittent black-outs, periods of time that would be lost from memory, could be stirred and remembered simply by reading journal entries he wrote as a child to help him remember. Acting that seemed rushed and confused by younger actors, it depicts the life of a troubled boy, a brother and sister with a pedophile father, and a boy with extreme emotional problems all friends in horrible, graphic events. But by reading these journal events would cause him to go back in time, time-traveling if you want to call it, enabling him to change something in the past, thus rippling the change of the past to the future. Each time he would go back to the past and change something, it would result in a different situation in the future. He doesn't make small changes, but drastic ones, causing huge changes in the future. Not like the fluttering of a butterfly's wings but the sheer force of a hurricane permanently rearranging the once and preserved future.    Ashton Kutcher puts a well-meaning performance, far atypical of his real-life and other acting personas (Punk'd, That 70's Show, Just Married...), in a genre that the audience has never seen. Though this may deter some to even watch this movie, the movie itself is so shocking and dramatic that the idea of Kutcher being the aloof Kelso is left far behind.    The movie does what every movie should do: it keeps the audience wide-eyed for the movie, starting off strong with profound, twisted events, leaving the audience with morbid curiosity. Although R-Rated for intense, graphic situations and controversial issues, this movie may be too intense for some.    The movie leaves the audience in a state of fascination, distraughtedness, and deep thought. The theme in the movie lends it one of the many, especially after watching either one of two versions: Director's Cut or Theatrical Presentation. (Director's Cut has a extremely odd ending, different from the Theatrical Presentation) Though one will get the idea that love drives us all to do anything for the sake of it, and the sheer realization that self-sacrifice is something we must all do in order to keep things in order.    Great directing, and story builds great with minor holes. However it doesn't not finish it with finesse, leaving the audience more bewildered and distraught than a deer caught in headlights. Acting is subpar, seemingly rushed and lacking in focus. Though credit should be given to Ashton Kutcher and Melora Walters for their performance.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Having gone out and buying this cd with the expectation of a angrer and heaver Iowa I was a little shocked when I played this cd for the first time.  I put the disc on random and sat down on my couch after a day of work.  Of cource the first song that is played is Vermillain pt 2.  My first reaction was \\"what the...?\\".  I stoped the cd and restarted it at the begining.  My only reaction was of awe.  Slipknot had incorporated elements from their preveious 3 cds.  Although the acoustic songs were a huge surprise also I didnt hear any remade songs from Mate Feed Kill Repeat as was the case in their last two cds.  Also during the time between Iowa and Vol.3 members of the band have gone out on side projects, all of which are good or decent in their own way,  some of the style from these side projects have been swallowed into the music for this cd.  The best example of this is how Taylor sings/screems and even more expressed emotion. <br />Bands must mature and create in order to survive.  This cd has and is showing how much Slipknot has matured in the way they make their music.  The music on Vol 3 doesn't need the swearing or amount of screeming requiered that has been used in the past.  Best example of this in my oppinion are the two Vermillian songs. <br />Even if you are not a Slipknot fan or if you are I highly recomend this cd.  I have since bought a second copy of this cd to put into my rucksack for deployments.  Only having room for 8 cds and a cdplayer in my rucksack the only hard part about having this cd is which cd I have to take out because Vol 3 going with me on the next deployment.
B00008PC2O|5.0|T2 is a great Movie. The speicial effects are good and it is kind of confusing in the begining because you dont know who is the good guy and who is the bad guy. The movie is about a kid who a T1000 who was sent back from the future by the machines that want to kill the kid because in the future there is a nuclear war that kills 3 billion people and the kid becomes the leader of the human army. The humans send a terinator to protect the kid. The T1000 is made of liquid steel so bullets go right through him. The movie is a lot like the first one. T2 is a good movie.
B00005JMEW|2.0|This movie was very over hyped, which is why I watched it.  I truly was hoping this movie would be something new and great.  Well, as far as new goes, yeah its slightly original, but its definatly not great!  It was so stretched out and got very boring at times.  There were so many parts in the movie that just shouldnt have been there.  If you watch this movie, ((which I honestly dont reccomend you do unless you really have nothing to do for the weekend)) you will know what parts I am talking about.  You can easily tell that these useless scenes were added to merely make the movie longer. <br /> <br />Another problem I have is that Kill Bill has been made into two movies when it could have easily been made into one movie.  Like I said before the delay and drag out Kill Bill 1 and its obvious that it is only done to make money off of a sequal for it. <br /> <br />I think that this movie had potential, but they went about it all the wrong ways.  I also have problems with the realness of the movie which I usualy dont care about.  But in this movie it got rediculous.  Everyone in the movie that gets stabbed litterly could paint a wall with their blood from fifty feet away from it.  Its as though they all have extremly high blood pressure.  Its the worst and stupidest looking violence I have ever seen.  And thats saying something because I never mind violence or gore, but in this movie it was just stupid gore. <br /> <br />I will not say only bad things about this movie as I did give it two stars meaning its not the most horrible peice of trash that I have ever seen,  but it is deffinatly amongst the worst.  One thing I liked about the movie was the plot.  As I said before it is quite original.  In the beginning of the movie it seems quite promissing, but the problem is it never delivers.  It dissapoints you about halfway through the movie and makes you slightly regret starting to watch it.  The main reason I gave this two stars instead of only one is because of the veryhorrible 'Soap Opera' ending of the movie that somehow very oddly gives you the urge to see the sequal even though you know it will be a waste of your time and mind. <br /> <br />All in all, I would only reccomend this movie to you guys or girls who are alone and have nothing to do for the weekend and really just want something that will keep your attention.  Because it does somehow pull that off.  But if you really want to watch a good movie with friends or something along those lines, then get 'Man on Fire' when it comes out on DvD and Video this September, or The Matrix Trilogy... <br /> <br />Bottom line, there are so many better ways you can spend your time.  Dont waste it on this movie unless you honestly have nothing whatsoever to do.
B00006690G|5.0|Eminem is so sexy, I get this warm feeling inside whenever I hear his name.  He is so phyne with his handsome face and the way he raps just makes me go crazy!  Wow, he's just like a Black dude.  But I don't really believe he's homophobic.  I mean, hello, he did a duet with Elton John, remember?  If Eminem goes on tour again and if he reaches my city, I'll meet him backstage and ask him out.  I think he'll say \\"yes.\\"  I'm pretty confident he will.
B00009V7RF|2.0|I dont know of any other group that turned more commercial than the BEP.  I enjoyed their two previous albums prior to this Elephunk, but this is just appealing to the masses to the point of begging to sell records.  Like that song, Shut Up, what the hell is that, how can anyone think that's a good track.  In their album Bridging the Gap, Apl talks about how they're the only true MCs that you'll hear on the radio, well, true MCs dont sell out, you guys are just hot garbage now. <br /> <br />I'm Out!
B0002KQNZO|5.0|I've only had a CD-R of this album for the past year or so as it was out of print and I wasn't able to find a moderately priced copy.  So I was very happy when I found out that it would be released as a RVG (along with Andrew Hill's Black Fire and Joe Henderson's Inner Urge this has been a great summer).  As for the music \\"Jesus F*****g Christ\\" is the first thing that comes to mind.  This CD has some of the most intense music I've ever heard.  Wayne Shorter's solo on the title track is unbelievable, him and Blakey are absolutely ferocious.  The title track, in particular, just feels like it towers over you.  You can hear how much Blakey leads and inspires the group with his playing.  The recording quality is also stellar.  The details and overtones of Blakey's cymbals are captured especially beautifully.  I think that this is one of those albums when there was some kind of magic throughout the session and everything that could have gone right seems to have.  I have no reserves in recommending this album and I can't imagine anyone being dissapointed with it.  Take advantage of this rereleased and remastered masterpiece.

B000286S8S|3.0|I haven't listened to this album but probably don't need to.  I know all the old stuff that's on it, have heard all the new tracks and have read several reviews.  I'm tired of the \\"who's better, Roth or Hagar\\" debate and can agree with those who say certain songs should probably have been included instead of others, and that not including a single cut from Van Halen 3 is an insult to Gary Cherone.   <br /> <br />Now.  One good clue as to the motivation for this album is that it is from Rhino Records, not VH's original label, Warner Brothers.  Rhino is the same group of people who gave us a double-disc Chicago collection four years after the second of two Chicago \\"greatest hits\\" CD's was released. Each of those two CD's had two original cuts at the most and the two CD's put together were about the fourth such set from Chicago in their career.  Rhino also \\"re-released\\" Chicago's first and only holiday CD two years after it was first released, so they could include a couple new songs there.  So, in other words, be skeptical of anything that isn't released on a band's original or most recently known record label, especially if it's from Rhino.  While the bands don't have to go for it, they aren't entirely to blame, either.  Rhino Records might as well be called \\"this is about money\\" Records.

The Fly Lady teaches you how to baby step your way into good habits!  Her approach really works for a lot of people.  Her website offers support as well!  I recommend this book.
B0002KVUKM|4.0|The first half hour of this movie made you wonder what kind of shlock was in store for the last hour and a half but I was very surprised to find myself drawn into the plot as it continued to develop. By the time the final climax of the movie came I was fully excited and into it. I highly recommend this movie and if you just bear with the first part being pretty corny, the rest of the movie is highly entertaining.
B00005JN2X|5.0|A couple days ago was I amazed by this movie. Gone was Tom Cruise's impish glint in the eye and dazzling smile replaced by  Vincent's  personality that would make an ice cube shudder. Reading the other reviews I was really disappointed at how  too many of them described what the move was about rather than making comments about the actual characters such as Vincent's matter of fact dark  humor over victim number one falling on Max's cab: \\"I didn't push him. I shot him. The bullet killed him not the fall\\" or the subtle change in Max who was forced to pass as the never before seen Vincent to that man in Club Fever to the point of being as cold and challenging while inside he was shaking in his boots hoping no one would suspect his true identity and eliminate him. I found the woman Prosecuter to be nothing more than the usual stereotypical whiney character. God forbid we should have a woman Prosecutor who could be beautiful and Inferiority Complex free. The best twist was the final scene on the train when Max and Vincent emptied their guns through that glass door. His clip dropping to the floor I thought Vincent  was going to reload. Instead we see he and Max staring at each other guns drawn with the only blood visible on either being from the cab accident. For several seconds do you wonder if both really missed at such close range. Not until Vincent sits do you realize he's fatally shot in the chest. Tom Cruse played Vincent so deliciously evil that I actually felt bad for him and my mind can't stop wondering the same thing he did in how long would it take before anyone noticed a dead man on the train. I had  such an outstanding 'cruise' with Mr. Tom Cruise that I'll have to seem him in more movies.
B00005JN2X|4.0|If I could, I would probably give this movie 3 and a half stars.  It was good, but I'm not sure if it merits 4 whole stars, but it does deserve more than 3. <br />So, Jamie Foxx is Max, an L.A. \\"part-time\\" (if 12 years can be considered part-time) cabbie who dreams of starting a limo service.  Tom Cruise is Vincent, a creepy contract killer who recruits Max to be his chauffeur for the night.  Vincent gives Max $600 and tells him that he has five stops to make, and then LAX.  If Max is a good driver, he'll give him an extra $100 in tips.  Vincent tells Max that he is in real estate and needs to get some signatures and visit some friends.  However, after the body of the first target falls onto Max's cab, Vincent kidnaps him and forces him to help him out or die defying him. <br />The actors were both very good at portraying their characters, but it was the movie's score and camerawork that made it truly effective.  The music playing in the background was very good at either complimenting a certain scene, or providing a good contrary to the situation.  For example, while we are waiting for Vincent to kill his first victim, Max is listening to classical music, and it continues all the way until the body lands on the cab.  Also, the movie was shot in a \\"home movie\\" style, meaning that it was very unsteady and moved with the action. <br />Sadly, the only major twist is easily guessed five minutes into the film, but the movie is still enjoyable.  While not the greatest movie I've ever seen, this is definitely the best I've seen in a while.
B000060P79|5.0|I LOVE this CD. it rocks! i listen to it ALL the time. its great for any teen!!
B000002H97|5.0|This album definately rocks. <br />There are many people who don't think this album is heavy and true to the ways of the metallica of old, but they can't have listened to this album with an open mind.  SO WHAT if they started getting more air time on the radio.  SO WHAT if they became more mainstreem.  This album was not a sellout by any definition of the word.  All of the \\"rebel\\" metallica fans just became threatened by a band that was succesful all around and not just with them.  They didn't listen to the music and they don's see that metallica is still, to this day, rockin it heavy like they used to.   <br /> <br />Sell out my ass. <br />This is a great album, maybe not their best, but still great.
B00003ZKRM|5.0|(THIS IS A REVIEW OF DISC I ONLY) Believe it or not, I had this as an album (does that give away my age or what?).  I played it so much the records became worn so when someone offered to let me borrow the first CD of this set, I jumped at the chance.  <br />  <br />There is just the right amount of wintry chill and evocative melodies that personified the the great late-Romantic artist. This was an Angel (EMI) recording that still shines with lots of class.  I loved the Karelia-Suite as well as the many short pieces that accompanied the major works. <br /> <br />The Halle Orchestra seems almost perfect in this outing.
B00014K5TQ|1.0|This was perhaps the worst film I have ever seen.  I can not understand how it has received so many good reviews.  I am a fan of the mythology and story, and thought the film would bring back memories of fun party days, but instead, I cringed with every horrible camera angle and misplaced line.  I entitled my review accordingly, because listening to the horrible dialogue and acting was like watching a train crash over and over again.  My biggest question directed at the production is, what was the casting director smoking when he chose this horrible line up?  Fez as Keoki?  WTF?
B00005JLD4|4.0|This notable film , is about the painful and real facts in the thirties in Australia when the aborigen were less than nothing .<br /><br />Three teenagers will refuse to respect the rules of game , decide to escape and will walk two thousand kilometers to rejoin with their families .<br /><br />The merciless human chase through the desert and the hair raising final sequence will reveal the epic spirit still lives in the human being .
B000000IRG|5.0|No long winded review here...  I realize that opinions on record record reviews are very subjective,  but seriously this album is a masterpiece of song writing.  Elton and Bernie Taupin are in full tilt on this one. <br />The motivator for writing this was really because I like to read Amazon reviews in reverse order from the 1 star givers first.  Go in this order and it's amazing to see how other people interrput music.  To the guy on this review site that suggested Yellow Brick Road was meant to be a children's album, and that many of the tunes were in questionable taste regarding to their lyrical content.  DUDE!!   Does the cover with a yellow brick road make you think it's for kids??  One listen and you should no there is nothing for kids here and never was there meant to be, this is for sure.    All fine that is..   At least they had something interesting to write about...\\"Dirty little girl\\" \\"Ballad of Danny Bailey,\\"  \\"Harmony\\" <br /> <br />Think about one last thing for a minute....  When you listen to what is being pushed out there today... 50 cent, Christina Agulara, ?sp.    All these folks are all about the vocalist and their \\"Hot\\" appeal.  The musicians actually playing on these records are studio guns for hire, (which certainly deserve respect) buy the music today is so thin and uninspiring! <br />Do you really see anybody today at 14 being totally motivated to pick up a guitar, take some lessons, and bust out some licks? <br />Hell no!  There is no fire in what is on mainstream radio today. <br />Our heroes, i.e.  Clapton, Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page, etc  etc.   are all in the 50's and slowly starting to kick off.  It's possibly going to be a very dry world in rock/roll or any other guitar driven music very soon. <br /> <br />OK... I'll chill out a bit.. Yeah, I probaly sound like an old fart. <br />Don't lose sight of the fact that this album is MONUMENTAL in terms of the craft of song writing.   Pick it up.
B000022TSH|5.0|Chinatown is a bizarre and intriguing story set in L.A. where a private eye (Jack Nicholson) will discover an awful drama behind all the corruption atmosphere you can brathe in this story . The last minutes are shocking all the way . Faye Dunaway is excellent as the femme fatale who hides her secret . John Huston plays the role of the merciless father and watch to Polanski in a cameo.<br /><br />This movie was the legacy given for Polanski to the universal cinema . Solid and arresting from beginning to end.<br /><br />It won the the Academy Award as best screenplay.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|The deluxe Park Hyatt Tokyo provides the backdrop for this quirky film about the evolving relationship between Bob Harris, a world-weary movie actor in town to pocket easy money for a Suntory whiskey advertising campaign, and Charlotte, an obviously smart young wife of a thoughtless, ambitious video director. Through happenstance, these two characters come together and over the course of the film, discover they are soulmates.<br /><br />This deceptively simple concept has been given a stylized and perceptive treatment by screenwriter and director Sofia Coppola, who has an obvious fondness for her characters and the setting. As a third-generation Japanese-American who has been to Tokyo a few times, I found the film was full of shrewd observations about current Japanese culture - the expansive karaoke hotel suite, the antiseptic strip club, the anal-retentive hospital waiting room, the Day-Glo Japanese talk show with the maniacally congenial host. I doubt if any other stateside filmmaker has captured the blinding lights and claustrophobic hustle of Tokyo better, much less the actual Japanese people in the way Coppola has done here without resorting to stereotypes. The scenes dealing with the communication barriers, while comically effective, actually feel authentic, not condescending.<br /><br />Upon first viewing on its initial release, I think the film was overrated given its saturated airplay during the entire awards season earlier this year, perhaps as an indie-endorsing affront to the juggernaut that was \\"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\\".  Now that a few months have elapsed, I can appreciate the movie more for its vivid sense of imagery and atmosphere, which does go a long way to compensate for the threadbare plot. The excellent soundtrack helps as well. Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson perform their roles as Bob and Charlotte in an almost improvisational manner, effortlessly achieving a genuine chemistry. Coppola's focus on Bob still feels a bit lopsided since it ultimately makes Charlotte more cryptic than she needs to be. For all its charms, the film does not take ultimate accountability for the changes that Bob and especially Charlotte go through, which is why I think the film falls somewhat short for me. Though the much-talked about ending is lovely and seems to signal a reunion in the future, one still gets the sense that the episode was nothing more than a warm, dream-like episode in their lives. I guess I expected to see more honest character development for all the praise heaped on this film.t ultimately makes Charlotte more cryptic than she needs to be.

B000089QEN|3.0|William Thackeray's classic novel about the opportunistic Becky Sharp (Natasha Little) and her climb toward social prominence receives the BBC treatment but fails to become more than an interesting, well-acted soap opera.  The entire production seems curiously flat and misses many opportunities to comment upon the parade of human vanity on display here that lends the work its title.  Becky's final actions in the last moments of the drama appear to conflict with the personality that has been established for her over the course of more than five hours.  Still, it is an enjoyable production and the cast acquits itself well.
B00009V7T2|5.0|I am a rational human being.  I have many likes and dislikes.  I listen to NPR.  I enjoy music of every genre.  I choose on price.  I compare shop.  I don't jump in without testing the water.  I am your neighbor.  I am not overly passionate.  In my opinion, THIS IS GREATEST ALBUM EVER CREATED.
B00003CWLF|5.0|I remember watching trailors for this film when it came out - at the time I thought it looked hammy and over-done. Perhaps it was the trailor that let it down - a very \\"hollywood\\" trailor for what in my opinion was quite an \\"un-hollywood\\" film. By this I mean that it wasn't all glory and fairy-tale endings and over-the-top. Half way through as events were unfolding I found myself begging my television (I watched this on DVD recently) for this not to be a true story because I realised how heart-braking it was going to be if it was. There is dispute over the \\"truth\\" of Anna Leonowens' story but this is irrelevant - the film is nothing short of an epic in its own right and if you want to study the facts of history then do so. It is beautfully directed - there is one of the most powerful montage scenes I have ever seen (spoilers) in the execution sequence. <br /> <br />Speaking as an Actress and an accent coach and an English woman, Jodie Foster's accent is rather good. I have never heard an American actor/actress be as accurate. She was believable, spoilt and charming all at once. Chow Yun Fat is my favourite actor and I cannot write about him objectively. He is what the Oscar was made for. If you are also a fan you cannot miss this one. (You shouldn't miss anyhing he does!) His performance in this film is nothing short of inspiring - to other actors, and frankly to other human beings as his insight into human behaviour can teach us all. The film is worth watching for what he does alone. But it is so much more. If you are looking for a film to rent then this is the one - this is something you should see for its production values (costumes all made from scratch - along with an entire palace which they built) cinematography, direction, the performances, and especially the morals which arise from it all. Go to it..
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Nine discs, four movies, a full day's worth of viewing material, riveting interviews. If, in the future, the compilation of a DVD is remembered as a post-digital art form, than the Alien Quadrilogy (despite its absurd title) will rank alongside the Lord of the Rings Extended Editions as an early masterpiece, a deep burrow into the black heart of this great, horrifying, perplexing, confounding and at times downright odd series. From its pulpy origins to its rise to the level of art at the hands of its charismatic shapers (Ridley Scott, Sigourney Weaver, John Hurt, Ian Holm, the incomprable, though often copied, H R Giger), to its recasting into a durable franchise under the iron hand of ultimate technocrat James Cameron, to its partial undoing in David Finscher's bold, unsatisfying experiment, to its final destruction at the unwitting hands of Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Joss Whedon (two talents which, though individually great, arguably should never have been combined) the story is retold in frequently bitter flashback, very little of the sugar-coating one normally associates with this medium.     Beyond this of course, are the films themselves; each shown in both their original and recut versions.     ALIEN: (theatrical cut) The most nightmarish and genuinely frightening of the quartet, Alien takes full advantage of Giger's contributions, creating a world that straddles the boundary between the logical and the fantastic, a world in which space becomes eternal night, a darkness in which our deepest and most primal thoughts lie concealed. With a cast of genius actors, brilliant pace and hugely effective editing, this is a masterclass in horror filmmaking.     (director's cut) This is one cut too many on an already perfect gem. The now-legendary \\"pod scene\\" with Dallas notwithstanding, there is little added of any interest, and quite a lot taken away. Extra scenes are weighted toward the end, which skews the original's perfect pacing.     Aliens: (theatrical cut) Another flawless steel contraption by master technician James Cameron, this film, though radically different from its predecessor in tone, actually dovetails with it perfectly. Confident enough to not need Giger (Cameron himself designed this film's addition to the mythos, the Queen) this story shies away from Freudian sexual terror and focuses on maternal love, human and monstrous, while the relentless direction connects straght to our adrenal glands, leaving us too exited to fear.    (director's cut) As with all films by Cameron, any alteration made at the insistence of a studio is a detraction. The restored material enhances the the story's themes and provides Weaver with an emotional focus around which to weave her character.     Alien 3 (theatrical cut): As slow, cold and desolate as the wasteland it takes place on, this film has few friends, though perhaps unfairly. Much of the plot seems incomprehensible at first viewing, and the artistic decision to leave Ripley bereft and longing for death turned many away. But I would say that Alien 3 ultimately anchors the trilogy, and, in a strange way, defines it. Looking back, there could never have been a happy ending for Ripley; her fate is tied to that of the Aliens. Her purpose in life is to protect her kind from them. She made that choice when she blew up the Nostromo.     (workprint edition)With much of the plot restored and the characters enhanced, Alien 3 emerges in the workprint edition as a complete film. Whereas the original cut was disjointed and vague, the restored material restores crucial plot points and character development. This is far and away the better of the two, and the most significant recut of the set.     Alien Resurrection: A mess despite the talent that concocted it. Essentially a new beginning for the series, with a new character (the Ripley clone is now part Alien herself, and therefore her ties to her species are not as binding as her donor's), this film sits uneasily between superficial action flick and the profound implications of its antcedents. Jean-Pierre Jeunet injects his \\"nightmare circus\\" mentality into the Alien universe, and one can only wonder what would have followed had he had a better script to work from.    (director's cut) Actually worse than the theatrical, with a number of bad jokes restored, a perplexing and downbeat ending on what appears to be a post-apocalyptic Earth, and a strange and unneccessary beginning.

B00005JMEW|2.0|I was astonished to find so many 5-star reviews of what is unquestionably a mediocre film, and for that reason I felt compelled to write my own. Before you mouseclick that \\"wasn't helpful\\" button out of fan reflex, I'll try to be as brief as possible: <br />1. Cardboard characters: face it, the characters in this movie have about as much dimension as Teletubbies. At times, they seem to be mere mouthpieces, designed for the singular purpose of performing Tarantino's oh-so-clever dialogue---which, incidentally, ain't that clever. <br />2. Bad, overly self-conscious and smarmy dialogue: seriously, I've read better dialogue in Stephen King novels. \\"Silly Rabbit,\\" Lucy Lu quips in one scene. \\"Tricks or for kids,\\" replies Uma Thurman, in whispered call and response. In the middle of the crucial and climactic fight scene, no less. Is this supposed to be funny? I can't imagine anyone ever snickering at this---except maybe a lobotomy victim. <br />3. Too self-referential. The scrambled chronology worked in Pulp Fiction. Here it seems not only unneccessary, but verging on self-plagiarism. I love cinematic experimentation, but French new wave this is not. Put the scenes in order and you have a fairly typical and tepid action film. <br />4. An incomplete experience. Together, the films work to be a three-star piece of cinema; an interesting spectacle, but still leaving the viewer dissatisfied. Severed from its counterpart, Kill Bill seems amputated and incomplete. <br /> <br />There were some elements to praise in this film---as many of you have rightfully pointed out---but alone they are not enough to merit even calling this a good film. Fair to middling, and that's about it.
0156027321|1.0|This book had the potential for being a good book. It has, however,unnecessarily descriptive cannibalism. You can make great film AND books without such violence. If this is why the book is selling so well, it's a sad comment on our society. It's even sadder it doesn't get mentioned in reviews. <br />Right after I sent this review in the first time, I came across this true story online -  <br />MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Four members of a family have been arrested and charged with murder for allegedly killing and eating a relative during a wedding reception -- and serving his flesh to unwitting party guests, police have said.
B000089RV6|5.0|I  have  been  an  AC/DC  fan  for  ten  years  and  I  own  all  their  albums, and  I  have  to  say  that  this  is  easily  Brian  Johnson's  best  album  and  quite  possibly  AC/DC's  best  album.  Here's  a  full  review  of  all  the  songs  starting  with  my  favorite  to  my  least  favorite. <br /> <br />You  Shook  Me  All  Night  Long- My  personal  favorite  on  this  album. Brian's  vocals  are  top-notch  and  so  are  Angus's  riffs. This  is  a  song  you  can't  help  but  sing  along  with  and  tap  your  feet  to. <br /> <br />Back  in  Black- Easily  one  of  heavy  metal's  most  recognizable  songs  and  one  of  the  more  rhythemic  AC/DC  songs. This  song  is  really  a  silent  tribute  to  Bon  Scott (As  is the  whole  album), and  they  really  honored  their  former  singer  well. <br /> <br />Hell's  Bells- One  of  AC/DC's  signature  songs. I  love  the  way  this  song  builds  up  from  church  bells  to  Angus  wailing  his  guitar  and  Brian  screaming  his  lungs  out! <br /> <br />Shoot  To  Thrill- Another  one  of  Angus's  masterpieces. Rudd's  drumming  on  this  song  is  particularly  good. Brian  once  again  demonstrates  that  he  can  match  Bon  Scott  note  for  note. <br /> <br />Rock N'Roll  Ain't  Noise  Pollution- I  love  this  song, and  what  better  group  to  sing  it  than  this!  This  song  is  AC/DC's  answer  to  all  their  critics, and  man  does  it  shut  them  up! <br /> <br />Let  Me  Put  My  Love  Into  You- One  of  AC/DC's  more  restrained  songs. However, that  doesn't  mean  that  Angus  doesn't  show  how  great  a  guitarist  he  is. I  love  the  chorus  on  this  song. This  is  an  AC/DC  song  that  your  mom  can  withstand  and  probably  the  most  romantic  of  their  songs. <br /> <br />Honey  What  Do  You  Do  For  Money- Angus's  riffs  are  once  again  off  the  charts. I  don't  particularly  like  the  subject  of  this  song, but  it  has  a  beat  I  just  can'tresist. <br /> <br />Givin  The  Dog  A  Bone- Rudd's  drumming  and  Angus's  riffs  are  what  give  this  song  its  energy. The  song  itself  is  a  little  cheesy, but  it  still  has  a  great  beat. <br /> <br />Have  A  Drink  On  Me- A  more  blues  kind  of  song. Brian  does  a  great  job  on  the  song, but  I  think  this  song  could  have  been  better  if  sung  by  Bon. However, it  is  still  a  good  song. <br /> <br />Shake  A  Leg- The  worst  song  on  this  album. However, it  is  by  no  means  a  bad  song. It  is  a  great  song  to  dance  to. The  only  really  bad  thing  about  this  song  is  that  it  is  too  repeatative. <br /> <br />There  is  no  bad  song  on  this  cd. It  is  one  of  the  few  cds  that  you  can  listen  to  all  the  way  through. I  recommend  this  cd  to  any  AC/DC  fan  who  is  willing  to  accept  Brian  Johnson  even  though  he  wasn't  the  original.  This  album  is  Brian  at  his  best. <br /> <br />I  also  recommend  the  following  AC/DC  albums: <br /> <br />Highway  to  Hell- Bon  at  his  best <br /> <br />Live (The  Collector's  Edition)- The  best  of  Bon  and  Brian. Sung  by  Brian. <br /> <br />The  Razor's  Edge- Angus  at  his  best. <br /> <br />High  Voltage- AC/DC's  earliest  album  and  Bon's  second  best  cd. <br /> <br />
B00006RINF|4.0|Comalies(2003). Lacuna Coil's third studio album.    Being mostly a heavy metal/classic hardrock/prog rock music aficionado, it wasn't until recently that I discovered and started getting into this gothic genre of music. My first real exposure to female fronted Goth hardrock/metal started with The Gathering's Mandylion(1995). When listening, I dropped all built preconceptions of what I like and don't like in music, and just enjoyed the album for what it was. And after thorough listening, I found a truly dark, heavy, and beautiful album, and thus another genre of music was opened up for me. Of course, it wouldn't be long before I stumbled upon Lacuna Coil, who were around almost as long as The Gathering was. And what better place to start than their new breakthrough album Comalies?    Up to this album, Lacuna Coil has released two EPs and two studio albums, and the band has been around for several years. Comalies probably features the best instrumental production quality of all their albums. The only exception is that sometimes the vocals are pushed behind the mix, which can get annoying at times. This is also their most commercial release, which might worry many people. Now the band aren't really technically proficient as musicians and they don't try a whole lot out of the ordinary, but the music doesn't need to be. Good songs are what counts, and in that this album delivers. If you want something more complex musically, then go listen to Dream Theater or Nightwish. Here you'll find accessible goth rock music that doesn't vary a whole lot on the tempos, but much in the way of melodies. Cristina Scabbia has a perfectly beautiful voice and her capabilities are properly taken advantage of. She, as well as Anneke Van Giersbergen, Tarja Turunnan, and Amy Lee have some of the most eloquent female vocals in all of modern rock music. Accompanying her is the male vocalist Andrea Ferro, who sounds alright, but Cristina is clearly the standout of the two. There's also a guitarist, keyboardist, bassist, and drummer who play their parts adequately.     Now for the songs. 'Swamped', 'Heaven's A Lie', 'Daylight Dancer', and 'Humane' all start the album off with powerfully catchy melodies and as such are some of the album highlights. 'Aeon' is an excellent acoustic intro which leads right into 'Tight Rope', another highlight. 'The Ghost Woman And The Hunter' is a good ballad. 'Unspoken' and 'Entwined' are decent as well. The only track I didn't care for was 'Angel's Punishment' which sounds very uninspired and boring. The title cut is sung in the band's native Italian language, proving that this band has a little versatility to show for every now and then.    Standout tracks: Swamped, Daylight Dancer, Heaven's A Lie, Humane, Aeon, Tightrope    Many have compared Lacuna Coil to the popular band Evanescence and often accuse them of being an \\"Evanescence ripoff\\". This is blatantly wrong for two reasons. One, this band has been around quite a bit longer than Evanescence, and therefore Lacuna Coil has found their sound long before Evanescence struggled with their first two albums (which are FAR BETTER than Fallen, btw). Secondly, Lacuna Coil are much more refined musically as a whole band than Evanescence are. The latter band may be catchier to the populous, but lets face it. Musically, Lacuna Coil walks circles around that band in playing ability and songwriting, plus there is no Nu-metal to be found anywhere in their music. Don't get me wrong, I think that Amy Lee has an excellent voice, but the band backing her up is no more than another Linkin Park (this is a bad thing). Now, I'm sure angered Evanescence fans are going to come here thinking, \\"BUT TDKMATO EVANESCENCE IS ON THE RADIO ALL THE TIME AND THEIR A LOT MORE POPULAR THAN THEM SO THAT MEANS THER BETTER LOL!!!11!\\". Well, Vanilla Ice and Britney Spears have gone multiplatinum in album sales, and yet I find them to be among the worst acts in the music industry. Actually, I have nothing against popularity. Afterall, Lacuna Coil has been featured at Ozzfest and their music has been played on MTV2. I hate MTV, but if that gets them a larger fanbase, then more power to them. As long as they still sound like Lacuna Coil, I'll stand behind them 100%. I just don't want to see it get to their heads like it did with Evanescence. Just listen to their first two albums and then the new one to see what I mean.    Anyways, Comalies is a great album for those people into this kind of music, and as such it gets 4.5 stars. It isn't perfect though because it does drag a bit in places, but the standout tracks make it worth it for fans. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.    Other similar albums:  -'Unleashed Memories' by Lacuna Coil  -'Mandylion' by The Gathering  -'World Of Glass' by Tristania  -'Mother Earth' by Within Temptation

I waded through bridge-sweepings all the way to the trite ending, just to humor a (now less than close) friend, who just can't BELIEVE that I was not (breathless italics implied, and little pink hearts with curlicues around them, too) Enraptured by the (lame excuse for a) \\"hero\\". PA-LEEEEZE! Get a grip people! <br /> <br />Plot summary for the Noble Reader (Yes! I'm giving away The End!):  <br />Mr. I-am-just-toooo-wonderful-aren't-I, a photographer for National Geographic (hot stuff, ladies), comes to town and sweeps Miss Trapped-on-a-small-farm-immigrant-with-a-cute-accent (poor thing) off her dainty size 9's. Fortunately, the Peon Husband and Grubby Kids are conveniently away on a trip! Hooray for the guy with a good line and hot camera! The blessed couple marrily flit around Madison County, indulging in silly dialogue, and Urgent Sex!, while He takes Marvelous and Moving Pictures of Her, as well as the unusual covered brides (the story device that brought Mr. Self-Impressed to town). These pictures which will be a big hit (the bridge pictures, not the chick shots--he keeps those for himself, alone) when published, and make him famous all because he has been \\"elevated\\" by Her. They play around with the idea of running away together, she to be his muse on his visionary travels. But their happy voyage of discovery will, of course, end in (you guessed it) TRAGEDY!!! After much gnashing-of-teeth, she accepts her self-imposed role of proper wife, to remain wholesome (if somewhat used), and stay with Mr. Ignorant-peasant-farmer-who-is-stupidly-unappreciative-of-her and his kids so THEY will be HAPPY. And, after the glorious farewell sex scene, Mr. Woody must be ohhhhh, sooooo noble and accept (cry me a river) her decision. But you know that (brave marching music) he will live the rest of his joyless life, dutifully, in acute sorrow, without any more gratuitous sex mind you, and maintain her memory... ALWAYS!!! Oh, and she will, too, for him. He packs up his professional photographer gear, climbs into his reliable old truck, and goes. Then the family returns home and Life, Oh Bitter Life goes on. And then time passes... and she receives The Package!!! HE has (you guessed it) died and left her HIS (photographic) EQUIPMENT. Oh joy! What a Guy! And the message that he had a selfless life without joy... . Eventually she dies and the kids realize what a sacrifice she made, having to lead a selfless life without joy... . Tears of appreciation for good old Mom! They scatter her ashes on the water that flows beneath one of her memorable Bridges of Madison County. The End. Finally, and not a moment too soon. <br /> <br />Don't waste your time and money! Normally, I would not recommended a movie made from a book, over the original book, but I suggest in this singular case, that you cheat--skip the book and watch the movie, instead. Mr. Eastwood's movie has better dialogue, takes less time, and you can be amused by Ms. Streep's faux Italian accent.

B0001Z52RU|4.0|I had heard a lot of mixed reviews about this film and quite honestly I didn't know what to expect.  Two of the people that I watched it with didn't like it but I was blown away.  It really makes one think about way things happen and how our decisions affect our lives down the road.  This movie does deal with some very disturbing adult subject matters (i.e. victims of child pornography, animal cruelty, and suicide).  I wouldn't recommend it to young viewers due to the aforementioned subjects but I think mature viewers should watch this movie and judge it for themselves.<br /><br />In addition, I liked the ending on the theatrical version the best.
B00000ICN5|5.0|I first heard SRV and Double Trouble - probably Pride and Joy - on the radio and I can recall only two other times in my life when I felt so dumbstruck - hearing the Beatles and Hendrix previously.<br /><br />As a middle aged man who first started playing guitar at a very young age in the 60's, I was always interested in hearing and seeing new players.<br /><br />On that day, I found out who this phenom was and immediately scoured my back issues of guitar magazines to see if there was any information about him. I also made a point of getting to a local record store that day and purchasing Texas Flood, that was probably played continuously for the next few months. And while I became a disciple of this incredible talent relatively quickly, the love affair was solidified when I was lucky enough to see him at the El Mocombo a short time later (the show that was released as a VHS / DVD).<br /><br />The title song - Texas Flood - is perhaps one of the greatest blues songs I have ever heard. It's even more remarkable when you realize that the song you're hearing was recorded almost \\"live\\" in the studio with a minimum of overdubs and takes.<br /><br />Jackson Brown allowed the band to use his LA home studio to record this album and if memory serves me correctly, the entire album was recorded in days or a couple of weeks at most. And they essentially played live in the studio which gave it a very authentic feel. It didn't sound polished or slick or too sterile. This was Texas blues guitar played by a man and band that had mastered their craft playing countless gigs in and around Austin, Texas.<br /><br />Of course, electric blues had been around for many, many years. And some of the greats like the Kings and Buddy Guy and Robert Johnson had had a significant influence on many of the great British players and bands like Clapton, Jimmy Page, Keith Richards and many, many others. However, this beautiful genre of music had relatively limited appeal to the \\"masses\\".<br /><br />With this release, the renaissance and rebirth of the blues began. Single handedly, SRV with the release of this and subsequent albums inspired interest in the blues. Suddenly, people like myself, who had been playing guitar and listening to blues for many years, suddenly saw it in a whole new light. My listening, I confess, had been limited to Clapton. After listening to Texas Flood, it became a mission to find out more about the men who inspired this guy.<br /><br />I realized that in order to really appreciate SRV's music, I had to listen to the men who inspired him to play guitar.<br /><br />In subsequent years, I've managed to purchase much of the same hardware that SRV used throught his career - SRV signature Strat, Marshall and Fender amps and heavy strings tuned down a semi tone in an effort to try and replicate his sound.<br /><br />However, I've not even come close. His ability didn't come from his equipment. SRV had a God given gift in his hands and ears. He was put here for one reason and one reason only - to play the blues.<br /><br />Stevie was once asked what he would like to accomplish with his music. He stated that he wanted to be remembered for taking the colour out of the blues.<br /><br />He succeeded.<br /><br />This is an incredible debut album which should be in anybody's collection.

6303913881|5.0|This movie is so awful it falls into that catagory of so awful it's good. From the very start of the moviel the laughs begin. Nomi Malone getting hitchhiking over reacts to a little thing by pulling her switchblade knife and she thusly reacts to pretty much every other guy in the movie in the same way: over the top! <br /> <br />I loved the dance sequences at the Goddess Show! Very bawdy,beautiful and sexual in the way Nature intended. Made me want to become a showgirl too even for all the humiliation they suffer. I wish there had been more dance sequences. <br /> <br />The characters are so vile and creepy they don't seem real, but that's the fun of this movie, when you start yelling back at the characters. It's sort of a Rocky Horror Show in this way. As one reviwer said, it should be on an ADULT Mystery Science Theater 3000, there is SOOOOO  much material here! <br /> <br />Elizabeth Berkeley's acting improved as the movie went on, but as others said, what else could she do with these lines? Who wrote this cr*p anyway??? The movie was technically very well done, good photography and editing, good music, great sets, wardrobe, everything but a decent screenplay. <br /> <br />But buy it. I guarantee you will NOT be bored. The premise of this movie is so sleezy it's like walking past an open door to depravity and daring to peek in and then going \\"Oooooh.\\"
B000059R8Y|4.0|For alot of people - myself included - this is perhaps one of Clapton's least memorable albums.<br /><br />It's not a riveting electric blues album in the same vein as From The Cradle. Or a brilliant collection of acoustic gems as we heard on Unplugged. It's not even an understated \\"electric guitar\\" album like Pilgrim, which in my opinion contains some of Clapton's finest vocals and most personal songwriting.<br /><br />Reptile is an amalgam of many, many different styles that Eric has explored over the years. And perhaps it's this lack of a central \\"theme\\" that's responsible for this feeling I have that's it's \\"inferior\\" to his other efforts in the 90's.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong - I think this is a very good album. Compared to 99.9% of what's out there right now, Reptile stands head and shoulders above rap (ever notice that rap is 3 /4 crap..!!), boy bands, Britney / Christina pulp, etc. It's just that by Clapton standards, perhaps I've set the bar so high that he has to fall short of my expectations occasionally.<br /><br />This album has something for everybody - classic blues (Come Back Baby, a fantastic take on an old Ray Charles tune),something funky (I Ain't Gonna Stand For It), some jazz-inspiried numbers (Reptile) and some soulful stuff.<br /><br />Clapton's guitar playing is, as usual, flawless. However, he doesn't seem to be playing with the same raw enthusiasm that I heard of From The Cradle. And vocally, he's made huge strides over the years to the point where his ability to deliver a vocal performance stands on a par with his guitar chops. However, he doesn't seem to be singing with the same personal \\"investment\\" in the lyrics as he did on Pilgrim, a album which contained some of his finest and most introspective lyrics.<br /><br />I think the small problem - and I emphasize the word \\"small\\" - I have with Reptile is that it sounds too \\"polished\\". Musically, Eric's band - consisting of old names like Andy Fairweather Low, Nathan East and Steve Gadd as well as the addition of Doyle Bramhall II, the son of Steveie Ray Vaughan's good friend and co-writer - is impeccable. Musically, Eric has always surrounded himself by the best musicians.<br /><br />And the Impressions certainly contribute some beautiful and soulful background vocals. No complaint there.<br /><br />And the songs are certainly very listenable. This CD contains an assortment of styles that provides an interesting diveristy for the listener.<br /><br />However, when I'm not listening to the CD, I'm hard pressed to remember the names of any of the tunes on this CD or how the melodies even go. There's nothing that really stands out, nothing that is really memorable. Nothing that grabs me.<br /><br />It's a very pleasant album to listen to, but it certainly wouldn't be an essential Clapton album that I would have to have on a deserted desert island.nd Steve Gadd as well as the addition of Doyle Bramhall II, the son of Steveie Ray Vaughan's good friend and co-writer - is impeccable.

B00025ETIW|5.0|My friend played this album in the car and I had to go out and get it.  From the first track to the last I loved it.  It hasn't left my cd player since i got it a month ago.  It is one of the best cds this year.  The lyrics have a goth feel to them.  His voice is really good and really shines on each track. This is one of those cds that you just have to get that won't dissapoint.  BUY IT!
B000286RNY|5.0|My family watched this movie on TV while in India earlier in the year and were totally delighted.  If you have a semi-twisted sense of humor, love kung fu type movies and cross cultural comedy this is delightful. We have been anxiously awaiting it's arrival in the USA. So very fun! Just need some hot noodles and sticky buns to eat while watching it.
B0000057C5|5.0|This is the first( and so far only) Rammstein album I bought.It kicks major arse!!! Here's a run-down of the songs(well, at least of the version I have):<br /><br />1. Sehnsucht (Longing)-5/5-It starts with a man yodeling, then it gets into a heavy song.<br /><br />2. Engel (Angel)-5/5-The first song by Rammstein I heard and it kicks ass!!!<br /><br />3. Tier (Animal)-5/5-I love the intro.<br /><br />4. Bestrafe Mich (Punish Me)-4.5/5-A slightly poppier song than the first 3, but it still rules.<br /><br />5. Du Hast (Du Hast)-5/5-Rammstein's most famous song. It is really good.<br /><br />6. B&uuml;ck Dich (Bend Down)-5/5-The heaviest song on the album. It's also my favorite song on the album.<br /><br />7. Spiel Mit Mir (Play With Me)-5/5-From the start of this, it's obvious it's gonna be evil. It starts with a sound that sounds a bit like the Jaws attack song, with people luaghing in the background. A few minutes in the song, there's a guitar 'solo' that sounds like something you'd here in a horoor film. This song should be on a horror film soundtrack.<br /><br />8. Klavier (Piano)-5/5-I love this song. It's also a sad song.<br /><br />9. Alter Mann (Old Man)-5/5-Why, why do I keep on giving perfect scores? It's cuz all the songs here rock!!<br /><br />10. Eifersucht (Jealousy)-5/5-I love the intro.<br /><br />11. Kuss Mich (Kiss Me)-5/5-Another good song. The only problem is that the vocals are too high to fit the sadistic content, but why let one problem bring down the rating?<br /><br />12.Stripped (Depeche Mode cover)-5/5-I really like this song. Esspecially the line \\"Let me hear you make discisions without your televisions.\\"<br /><br />Bottom Line: This album rocks! If you want to buy a Rammstein album, but don't know which one to get, this one has your name writtin all over it.<br /><br />I'm done here.
B0001MDP3G|3.0|I saw COLD MOUNTAIN in the theater without having read any professional critics' reviews. I decided to go into this possible Oscar contender with as open a mind as possible. The result, alas, was a measure of disappointment.     It certainly wasn't too long and boring, as a lot of people have said of THE ENGLISH PATIENT. No, the problem with this movie is that its dramatic core seems to be missing. Okay, the story is how wounded Civil War soldier Inman (Jude Law) wants to get back to his love Ada (Nicole Kidman), but has to go through an ODYSSEY-type set of adventures to do so. Except, in the scenes set before Inman goes off to war, we never get a sense of real romantic chemistry between these two (although Law and Kidman certainly try to pull it off): neither when they first meet, nor when Inman departs from Ada. Their initial meeting scenes are much too brief (truncated, perhaps?), and if we don't believe the central romance at its heart, we surely don't believe in Inman's dogged determination to get back to a love that he hardly even knows. Throughout the central passages of the film, I never felt anything truly at stake throughout Inman's journey, and for me that is a real letdown.     If the film is pretty much dead at its dramatic center, at least its edges are full of life. I don't know if Renee Zellweger deserved her Oscar for THIS role as a no-nonsense mountain girl that stays with Ada---it's not a great role, and hardly an acting stretch for her---but she still livens up the film considerably by her sheer personality when she arrives on the scene. Her scenes with her father, especially, are a hoot---in a good way. She is certainly fun to watch, even if it's debatable whether she's really necessary in the film (but then, I can't say I've read Charles Frazier's book). Indeed, some of the characters Inman meets along his quest are interesting: some comic (Philip Seymour Hoffman's Reverend Veasey), some poignant (Natalie Portman's lonely single mother Sara). And the film is, once again, handsomely well-mounted by Minghella and gloriously shot by cinematographer John Seale, esp. in the impressive opening battle scene (with one of the best explosion shots I've ever seen) and the shots of snowy mountain peaks at the end.     All in all, COLD MOUNTAIN is the classic case of a movie that has some very good parts which simply do not add up to a satisfying whole. It has great individual moments, but the central romance is thin and underdramatized (although Minghella certainly tries to make up for the missing passion at the beginning when Ada and Inman meet again at the end), and thus the glue that would sew together the disparate parts simply isn't there. One of Minghella's previous films, THE ENGLISH PATIENT---which won a ton of Oscars in 1996---is a much better film with a vastly more coherent story and convincing central romance than. You could do much worse than COLD MOUNTAIN, but you could also do much better.
B0000013G9|4.0|TLC's sophmore album entitled \\"Crazysexycool\\" is a must for any music fan. The album comes equpipped with the four hit singles that were released from the album (Creep, Diggin' On You, Waterfalls, Red Light Special). After a few listens, one will never wonder why they are one of America's favorite female groups. Is it because they stressed safe sex by wearing condoms on their clothes? Is it because they created style for teens all over the world? Or maybe because they have those CRAZY SEXY COOL attitudes? Whatever the reason, TLC is loved by many.<br /><br />\\"Crazysexycool\\" has its share of fun songs, sexy songs, serious songs, and includes one remake, (If I was Your Girlfriend). Because TLC has so many kinds of songs on their CD, msotly everyone has something they can get from the CD. \\"Creep\\" is the groups first release from the album. The song is about a woman not getting attention from the man in her life, so, well, she creeps. The song went to the top of the charts. \\"If I Was Your Girlfriend\\" was originally created by Prince, but anyone who liked Prince's version will probably enjoy TLC's rendition as well. T-Boz does a great job of covering the lyrics. The music to the song is great. \\"Case of the Fake People\\" has meaningful lyrics, but I consider the song a filler. \\"Waterfalls\\", TLC's biggest song to date, is the song about not taking risks. The message is very deep, and Left Eye's rap is really nice. Left Eys contributes a lot of raps to the album, which enhance the album. She actually says something that makes sense in her rhymes, and she adds to the flavor of TLC. \\"Red Light Special\\" has a nice, sexy feel to it. Chilli does a great job in singing lead vocals. The song was a hit as well.<br /><br />TLC created a really nice CD with \\"Crazysexycool\\". TLC helped make 1994 a lot of fun with their performances, songs all over the radio, and the album itself. Go ahead and get this one, it's worth the money. 4 stars.<br /><br />Mikeisha's Top 5<br /><br />1. Red Light Special<br /><br />2. Waterfalls<br /><br />3.

B00003CXCT|5.0|I have no problem at all if Lucas adds and changes more stuff in HIS movies he has the right to do so. <br /> <br />As long as the movies work together in the end i think it's fine. When other people watch the films in the future it will make sense to them . <br /> <br />Once Episode III: Revenge of the Sith comes out next year it will make more sense of replacing old anakin with episode III anakin at the end of Jedi. <br /> <br />I heard that the reason that they don't say anything about the changes is because there waiting until Sep/8/04 just a few weeks before they relese them to get the media and people talking about them. <br /> <br />But these DVD's are looking great they did such a great job restoring all the scenes that it looks like it was filmed last week. <br />People stop crying and get on with your lifes.
B0002IU988|5.0|Before you say \\"uh-oh, not Creed pt. 2\\", listen to One Day Remains, the song. The new singer has TALENT, he doesn't emit a low-pitched, half-whisper like the lame-@ss Scott Stapp, he can go into high pitch, right into low pitch, and everything inbetween. The guitars are amazing, when was the last time you heard an amazing guitar solo in a Creed song? This is what Creed should have been for years, a TALENTED HARD ROCK/METAL BAND. not a terrible grunge inspired drivel piece of crap.
B00004WMZW|4.0|If you buy one T Rex CD get this one! <br /> <br />This is the height of Marc Bolan's songwriting ability and is one of those albums that flows seamlessly from the first song right through to the last. A perfect example of a classic rock album, it's boogie swagger and post hippie glam metal pop rock shake make it a firm soundtrack for the early seventies. There is so much good boogie pop rock that flows so easily from the fingertips of Mr. Bolan that no one ever really equalled T Rex in this genre of music. <br />Song highlights: Metal Guru - an anthem for the glam generation, The Slider - the title track and easily one of T Rex's greatest songs, Buick MacKane, Chariot Choogle - two irresistably catchy chug along rockers, Telegram Sam - probably the best known song from the album. <br />Get this CD you can't go wrong.
B000002LLC|4.0|This cd is not Madonna's best album to date, but it is intresting to see Madonna try her hand at Jazz/Swing.     1.He's A Man: a nice jazzy song to introduce this cd. It has a good jazz sound to it.    2. Sooner or Later: This song is not one of my favs on the cd. It's still a fairly good song, though.    3.Hanky  Panky: This one of the best songs on the album. This song is a revelation of what is to come in Madonna's career. It's sexy, it's funny, it's hot!.    4.I'm Going Bananas: This is my least favorite song on this cd. It is atrocious. Madonna sounds like an idoit singing so high pitched and the lryics are quite hideous, too.    5.Cry Baby: This is another good song. This has a very 30's sound to it. The lyrics and music are very 30's inspired. I don't know why this one didn't make to the Movie Dick Tray.    6. Something To Remember: This is a gorgeous ballad. This song is so wonderful it would even become the title of Madonna's Collection of Ballads: Something To Remember.    7. Back In Bussines: This song is another good song. It's a really good swing song that sould have appeared on the Movie Dick Tracy.     8. More: I really like this song. It a remasterd version, but it is still hot. Madonna keeps the 30's sound, but puts her name on it, too.     9. What can You Lose?: This is the last song on the cd, to appear on the movie, Dick Tracy. This is a slower song, in which Warren Beatty is singing with Madonna. It has real balladic feel to it, also.     10. Now I'm Following You Part One: This song is a short song, but still good. This a song you would want to tap dance to.     11. Now I'm Follwing You Part Two: Track 10 goes right into this track. It is simmilar to track 10, but Madonna gives this song a more moderen sound and includes some lyrics from the movie. I like the previous version the best.    12. Vogue: The best song on this cd. I think everyone has heard this song before. It is one of Madonna's best. This song doesn't fit in here, except that someof the stars Madonna salutes here, were popular in the 30's. A wonderful ending to a great cd.

1592400876|4.0|Well, no, it ain't all that enlightening when it comes to teaching the rules of punctuation--you knows 'em by now or you doesn't--but it is pretty funny--hilarous, in spots--in Truss's rants about this and that example of iggerance or stoopidity in our pop culture. And she is to be commended for refraining from shooting fish in a barrel: there's not a single reference to the lapidary prose issuing daily from the mouths of POTUS.    It seems impertinent to play Gotcha! with this paean to precision, but there persists, even in the 15th printing of Gotham's American edition, a pretty obvious error on page 124. Evelyn Waugh certainly knew that attachs work not in legislations, but in legations. Those who work at all, of course...    Gotham won't accept e-mails, and I lost my spray can somewhere in the subway, so I am obliged to out them in this tawdry and commercial space.  To err is human; to forgive, unsatisfying.
1400032717|5.0|Reading this is akin to falling down a rabbit hole, going to a place where all the markers of life are upside down.  Most people don't have Christopher Boone's skill at mathematics--but most readers of this book can find their way home after dark, and Christopher can't.  Is the novel an accurate depiction of autism?  I'm no expert so I don't know, but it feels right.  There's a bit of the Rain Man here, a little of Faulkner's idiot in \\"The Sound and the Fury,\\" and even a touch of Igatius Reilly from \\"A Confederacy of Dunces.\\"  Still, Christopher Boone is himself, unique, displaced, savant.  The most remarkable sequence in the novel involves a rather simple journey the narrator makes and the difficulties he initiates.    All in all, this is a book that will not be easy to forget, not for a long, long time.
B000002UA0|5.0|Piper at the Gates of Dawn easily one of the best albums of all time, also Extremely underrated, just to let all you piper naysayers know, after Syd was no longer in the band, Roger Waters wrote most of the songs,...and most of his songs were about Syd...therefore all that stadium arena rock crap that they put out in the following years that you guys say is way better than piper, wouldnt exist if it werent for Syd. Everybody knows that Roger Waters was just imitating Syd in the years following. Anyway just wanted to get that out there. Amazing album, anyone who is sick of being spoonfed radio crap should dig in to this and build from it.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|When I first heard this album, I thought it was complete crap, and I put it away for a month.  When I got it out the next time, I started to listen to it, and I was amazed by the geniusness of it.  I agree with anyone who says you have to get used to ATDI to really like them. <br /> <br />The first five tracks are the best, in my opinion, especially Arc Arsenal with its catchy, whatever you want to call it (the Ghostbusters thing) in the intro.  The lyrics are great.
B0002858YS|4.0|First off I'd like to apologize for writing such a bad review and giving this album two stars. I've deleted my old review, got my facts straightened and listened to the album at my friends house. This album is not bad, I still have a problem with the repetative lyrics in some songs but all in all this a good album. Compared to other crappy artists today like Sausage Links, I mean Linkin Park and Hoobastink this band is incredible. \\"Somebody Told Me\\" was not a very good debut single since the lyrics were repetative and the music video made the bass player look like a faggot and have no idea what he was doing even though I could hear a good bass in the backround. The guitar playing is good and the drumming surpasses any band (except Blink 182) in the past 10 years. These guys are very different from most bands today and for that they are credited since they are mainstream. Yes people, I do realize that they are from Vegas and I apologize for saying that they came over from Britain thinking they could get as much publicity as The Beatles. There, if you want something different then buy this album and if you like lines said over and over.. j\k, then get this.
B0001Z53AQ|2.0|I've read a lot of these reviews and I've learned this much......Amazon.com critics either get 1,000,000% behind an artist and hands them higher praise/stars than they really should be getting......or they do the exact opposite and just hate it for very childish reasons.  Very few people speak on the actual CD, rather they bash Eminem/D12 rather than telling the reader what makes the CD so bad.  I've seen reviews that gave this album 1 star because the reviewer prefers Esham instead.....or because he's a white man that hangs out with black men.....or because they're just die hard Ja Rule fans......or simply because he is who he is.  Then you have those that give this album 5 stars if for no other reason than the fact that Eminem is associated in some way (we have a word for these two extremes where I'm from: Haters or D*ck Riders).  Either way, none of these reviews are acurate and almost all of them fail to speak on the CD itself.  This album isn't anywhere close to 5 stars, but it's not deserving of a 1 star either.  \\"D12 World\\" is typical pop rap.  Anyone that bought this album in search of anything else was a fool to begin with.  The CD opens with Eminem spitting rhymes that would be ultra tight if they came from someone else, but Eminem (who has always been tight to me up until this point) has lost some steam and on this album it starts to show.  I'll speak about the other group members, but as we all know....they don't really matter.  Bizarre manages to bring the rating of this album down 2 stars all by himself.  If you want some decent rhymes from someone other than Eminem, look for Kon Artis or Proof.  Those two should break camp and start doing some solo stuff.  There are tracks produced by Kanye West and Lil' Jon (who supplied a VERY weak beat for the \\"40 Oz.\\" single), but for the most part, Eminem handles the production work and most of his beats sound the same.  Don't get me wrong, I like his beats, but they can get REALLY repetitive.  Most of the songs are VERY long and tend to be on the boring side.  A perfect example would be \\"Loyalty\\" feat. Obie Trice.  I love the beat and some of the lyrics are hot, but it's kind of long (5:54).  If you strip this entire album of all the beats and just listened to the lyrics, you'd actually have a pretty wack album on your hands. The beats aren't really that tight either.  And having Eminem perform every hook can be a bit tiresome.  But on a positive note, it's a progression from the last album in the sense that they're not trying to \\"out gross\\" or \\"out shock\\" each other on this album like they were doing on the last LP.  Overall, this is a middle of the road album.  Like I said before, it's typical pop rap.  If you expected something other than that, then the joke is on you.  Pop heads will love it, but heads like me that want skills and substance are better off searching the underground for quality hip hop because there is none on this album.  I would reccommend downloading this album instead of actually buying it though.  Come to think of it, I would NEVER reccommend buying any album that has Bizarre rapping on it.  He has NO SKILLS at all.  But that's just my opinion.  In my mind, if Eminem had never blown up like he did, you'd never hear from these guys (well maybe you'd hear from Proof and Kon Artis).  This is a perfect example of how having a famous homie can get you a record deal instead of landing a deal with actual skills.  Just ask Juelz Santana, him and the rest of the Dip Set are in the same boat.are VERY long and tend to be on the boring side.  A perfect example would be \\"Loyalty\\" feat. Obie Trice.

B00005LIN0|5.0|This is an exceptionally powerful opera presentation.  Visually and dramatically it is riveting.  Musically it is mesmerizing.  I can't say enough about it and unfortunately my words fail me, but I was so moved I had to put something down here to alert potential buyers to please do buy it and treasure it.  <br /> <br />The human truths told in this story are deep wide (not for the squeamish) and clearly relevant and recognizable for our world today.  Musically it is irresistable with its rich and lilting melodies and \\"fascinatin' rhythms\\".  <br /> <br />The cast is excellent in every way.  Their voices are powerful and beautiful and they project their characters with honesty and craft. The direction and photography puts you in the story powerfully and unforgetably.    This is a WOW performance of a constantly delicious score.
B000286S8S|3.0|Although flawed in the track selection, this is closer to what should've been released at the time instead of \\"Best Of Volume 1\\".  I could've done without the redundant live tracks which could've  made space for sorely missing classics such as \\"Mean Streets\\".  I thought \\"Human's Being\\" deserved a spot on there as well. The new songs are ok but don't quite match the fun of the(then)new Roth/VH songs from the first compilation. <br /> <br />If you are curious about Van Halen you could do worse than to buy this collection.
B00005MAM2|5.0|If you are an anime fan then this is the movie to see. <br />I first heard of this movie when i downloaded an anime music video and the anime was Akira. The next day i find out a freind of mine owns the movie so i borrow it. I was blown away the animation is incredible i also loved the music of the movie.  <br />A month later i go and get my own copy of the movie. This is definetly one of the best anime's i have ever seen. If you like this anime then you should check out Princess Mononoke it isnt as good as Akira but it is a great film. The movie is mostly centered around two teenagers,Kaneda and Tetsuo. Tetsuo gets in an accident when he encounters a strange child and he is taken by the army. He awakens and discovers his new powers but he is driven mad with power. CHECK THIS MOVIE OUT!!!!
B00005K9QP|5.0|Absolutely essential British blues rock album!  <br /> <br />Pre-Cream Clapton is (or was) God in '66 (until Jimi came along. Sorry, I'm a huge Clapton fan, but Jimi was better than all his British contemporaries combined). <br /> <br />Searing solos (guitar & harmonica) & grinding tone (Yes, it is Clapton raw yet refined). Mayall deserves a lifetime achievement award at the least. An incredible muscian/singer/pianist/harmonica player & bandleader.  <br /> <br />Younger players outside of the blues genre owe it to themselves to buy this. Think you know how to play that guitar? Think again, kid. <br /> <br />This is REAL guitar playing w/ a REAL band, no studio enhanced wizardry or MTV fabricated power-ballads.  <br /> <br />I'm not a hardcore blues fanatic, but I must confess I LOVE this album!
0385510438|5.0|I have only read three John Grisham books so far - (The Last Juror, The Firm, and The Summons) - and this one is his best. It's not just a legal thriller like some of his others, it has a great story of life in Ford County - see The Summons and A Time to Kill. <br />   It starts with a young man coming to Ford County and working for the town newspaper, which he then buys it. This is the main reason I liked it. It told the story through the owner of the paper instead of another lawyer. This book has some great characters who make the book.
B000002UJQ|5.0|One of the greatest rock albums of all time. Period. <br />Extraordinary musicianship, arrangements, interplay, lyrics & singing. <br /> <br />Believe the hype.

B00005JMAH|4.0|\\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\" succeeds on many notes but fails to execute the more important elements of the story. But first I'll note the positives, because although this movie is flawed, it still had some GREAT stuff. <br /> <br />Briefly, the famous wizard Harry Potter is about to start his third year at Hogwarts School. But a fierce dark wizard Sirius Black has done the impossible - escaped from Azkaban Prison. Everybody's lives - especially Harry's are in danger. This film is the third chapter in a series of films based on the novels by J.K Rowling. <br /> <br />Firstly the music, which is always a great listen has gotten even more magical. There's an original song called \\"Double Trouble\\" which is very clever and definately transports you into the world of wands.  <br /> <br />Secondly, the special effects are also great. Two particularly good installments are the Dementors (horrifying ghostly spirits) and Buckbeak the Hippogriff (a half eagle, half horse creature). The overall special effects were good. Although it doesn't come close to \\"Lord of the Rings\\" standard, they were certainly better than the last two films' visual effects.  <br /> <br />Thirdly, the young actors (including Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson) put in a much more passionate performance playing our heros Harry, Ron and Herminone. I also loved seeing some of the great actors back in the robes including Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson and Dawn French (to name a few). <br /> <br />But although the technical aspects of the film were above average, the actual film was a huge disappointment for me, and I'm sure for millions of other Harry Potter fans.  <br /> <br />You see, the attitude of the film was completly mis-initerpretted and was more of a comedy bash and less of a movie about good versus evil. Yes, Rowling's original stories are very humourous and ingeniously witty, but there is another serious and haunting side of the books that was too vague for my taste. The emotional side of the film was overpowered by unnessecary wise-cracking. Like I mentioned before, I am all for humour, but there was simply too much of it for the motive of the storyline. It's a story of horror, of evil, of heartbreak - all of which were very poorly conveyed and I was not impressed. <br /> <br />Secondly, was the wussiness of the wizard jock Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton). Malfoy is not a clutz! He is a sinister, cunning and spiteful teenager. Again, this important element of Rowling's stories were overwhelmed by silly humour. <br /> <br />And finally was the ending of the film. While the opening was brilliant, the ending is a repulsive close-up still of Harry's wind-pulled face as he flies his broomstick, and just ends the entire film on a pointless note. Another minor issue was Hogwarts' sudden change of location but I wasn't really fussed about that. <br /> <br />Maybe I'm a little bit critical, but as a passionate Harry Potter reader, I was really unimpressed by how this film turned out. The books get substantially darker as you move through and that darkness simply wasn't outstanding.  <br /> <br />But as I stressed earlier, this IS a pretty good film. The acting, music and visual effects really were very well done. Although I didn't appreciate the  overhumour, I DID enjoy some of the fresh jokes and had particularly loved Ron's facial expressions (whoes character WAS fairly faithful to the novels).  <br /> <br />I really hope the fourth film is a bit more faithful to its novel, because it is a MUCH darker story. Nevertheless, I am lookng forward to its release! :) <br /> <br />So in conclusion I enjoyed this film alot apart from those couple major flaws. I hope this review is helpful and shows you not only the good sides, but also the aspects that could have been improved. It was a good effort, alot of fun, but not quite in the right spirit of things.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|c-mon i get it already Brittany Spears is Hott but it doesnt mean she has good music this is Sell-out MTV crap to the extreme i guess there are some people out there that like this mostly \\"Extreme A+F Preps\\" but i am not even sure if they liek it i mean of course they can lie but c mon seriously does this music make you think does it make you wonder about stuff no all it makes me think about is brittanys body and how it sells she is bascially a Hooker only instead of jumping bones she is making music and posing her body on the covers and making it look all FUN and TEENY BOPPER and hip...............when will people learn??????
B00005JKED|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen in my entire life.  I loved the talking, the profanity, the violence, the gun shots, the blood, the slang, the evil looking mexicans and black americans, the story, and everything else.  There is not one single thing wrong with this movie.  Top of the line.
B000002LEE|4.0|At first listen i thought this was boring but after a while it grew on me and i figured that Janes Addiction is great because they deliver the energy most abnds often leave out they are very loud and raw and sometimes their melodies can be not so catchy but the point is that this band is great if you like Red Hot Chili Peppers then get this cd
B00005JN2F|3.0|I have to say I haven't seen camera action like this since the XFL.<br /><br />I hope the DVD is not as bad. The camera moves so much in the action scenes I had a hard time following what was happening and it really spoiled it for me. I had to look away at times as it felt like my seat was moving.<br /><br />The car chase is one of my all-time favorites. That was some really nice work.
B000065V1V|3.0|The first six songs on Heathen are an overwrought, overproduced mess. Although there is much to admire (check out the guitar loops on Sunday), the instrumental parts fight for breathing room, and ultimately strangle the songs. There is also an unfortunate tendency to push the drums and bass too far up front in the mix. The end result is stodgy, in spite of some pretty good songcraft. Thankfully, Heathen improves after that disastrous opening (I kinda like 5:15 the Angels Have Gone and Everyone Says Hi), but the overall result won't make anyone forget Hunky Dory or Low.
038073186X|5.0|I was really suprised with this book. I picked it up expecting a quick easy read and while it was a quick read, I enjoyed every page of it.<br /><br />Basically, I don't want to give away anything about the book to you guys. Read the jacket of the book if you want to know what it's about or just trust me when I say it a great novel. I personally had no idea what was going to happen next and that's probably because I was hanging on every last word. You ever read a book and just know, I mean KNOW they are going to make this into a movie eventually? Well this is one of those books. I normally stick to the scf-fi/fantasy genre but I sure am glad I picked this one up (bought it for the wife actually who likes suspense and she made me read it). Sorry if this review doesn't go into detail on the plot but I truly think that it should be explored by you as I wouldn't want to ruin anything.<br /><br />Well, enjoy.
B00009V7T2|5.0|I've had this album for almost a year now and lemme just say that I'm still obsessed with it! The Haunt of Roulette Dares and Televators still give me industrial amounts of goosebumps, they're amazing! Now I may be young, but I'm still a great fan of classic rock and not many new artists impress me but the Mars Volta did more than impress me with this album, they just blew me away! So GO BUY THIS ALBUM! IT'S THE BEST 10$ YOU'LL EVER SPEND!!!
0440224764|4.0|This is a fantastic book - one of Grisham's best in my opinion.<br /><br />It has all the typical lawyerly stuff, with a twist that the main character has effectively made himself disappear!<br /><br />My only complaint is that the ending left a little to be desired - I am finding that true with many Grisham books - they are excellent, fast paced reads - but often the ending seems like it was abrupt and incomplete.<br /><br />Anyway, if you love Grisham, you will love this book.
B00005JN2F|2.0|The feeling in this movie is nowhere near the same feeling in the first one.  I felt a solid relationship between Matt Damons character & Franka Potente so that helped me enjoy the movie-it felt like they were real people not just characters in a movie.  However, in this movie I felt no connection with any character and it just felt like the first except no leading female.  How many times are people going to try to kill Jason Bourne?  The camara work was too much for this movie, too. At times I felt nautious and I wanted to close my eyes. But the car chase toward the end was wonderful.  He just wanted to end the chase and chase brought into a tunnel was great.
B00005JNEI|1.0|Michael Moore continues his bigger-than-life role as an \\"Act-Up\\"-style detractor of all that he feels is wrong with the United States. Since Michael sees so much wrong with our country, his film topics will be endless. Michael's persona fills up each frame in this latest street-guerilla-with-a-film-crew documentary. Unlike his other films, Michael allows a young man dressed up as a Marine to share center stage with him. He parades this slim deer-in-the-headlights looking actor around ambushing and then confronting Republican officials, who often have a similarly vacant gaze. He never assaults John Edwards or John Kerry for their support of the Afghani and Iraqi wars.  <br /> <br />If you are a Republican, this film will not change you mind on how to vote. So, Republicans, don't waste your money. If you are a Democrat, Michael's film is designed to deepen your hatred for the administration of George II. So, Democrats, waste your money and go see this film...George II's tax cuts will ensure that Michael Moore has more of your money to take home or take to the nearest pizzeria. But, Michael's intention is not to deepen our understanding of the United State's role in contemporary world politics, only elicit contempt for our country and George W. I hope that Michael's next film will address the greatest killer of Americans...obesity. <br />
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This movie gives it all.  I laughed, I cried, I felt great by the end of the movie.  The cast was great and well picked for this movie and christmas was a perfect time for it to be released because holidays are a great time to feel wonderful and this movie does it.  I recommend this movie to anyone who just wants to have a great time watching a movie!
B000035Z1Z|4.0|I don't do romantic comedy or \\"chick flicks\\" as they are called. This chick is just not into that sort of fluff. However, I ended up watching this movie quite by accident, and came away from it having enjoyed it. <br /> <br />Meg Ryan is Kate, and her fiancee has just dumped her for a French Goddess. So, as anyone willing to drag themselves through the dirt for another, Kate follows them to France, bent on getting her beloved Charlie back.  <br /> <br />She meets Luc, played masterfully by Kevin Kline on the way, and from there begin a series of adventures that would be unfair to give away in this review.  <br /> <br />This movie got four stars mostly because Kevin Kline cannot go wrong. He is startlingly sexy in this movie, and he delivers some of the most hilarious lines I've seen in a movie of this genre. He made the movie. Anyone else in his role would have made this just another chick flick.  <br /> <br />There is just enough toilet humor in it to rob it of too much sentimentality, and even though the mushiness is something you go into this sort of movie expecting, it isn't so saccharine you feel you need to brush your teeth after watching it. <br /> <br />Meg Ryan is in her element, being cute and neurotic. It is a solid performance in a role typical for her and holds no surprises, nor does it stretch much.  <br /> <br />Predictability robs it of a five star rating. Before the opening credits were done, I knew exactly what would happen, and needed only to discover how.
B00005JLZN|5.0|This movie is excellent.  Kevin Spacey and Kate Winslet bring out outstanding performances.  You feel compelled to love David Gale even though he is a committed rapist.  I love the direction of Alan Parker with the spinning camara and the words flashing as it dissolves from present to past.  And toward the end, it keeps you guessing and a BIG surprise is at the end.
B000295V7G|4.0|This second album of Megadeth is not there best work... but still a grat album. A lot of Megadeth classic is in it (Peace Sells, Wake Up Dead, Devil's Island...). This is the last album of Chris Poland and Gar Samuelson... The only negative point in this album is that it is too short... Only 36.18min<br />Still a classic
B00005JN2X|5.0|I will start out by saying I don't think highly of Jamie Foxx & Tom Cruise (I only like him in a few movies such as Eyes wide shut, and Minority Report).  But this opened my eyes to their great acting abilities.  Jamie Foxx did a brilliant job especially when he went from scared taxi driver to bad ass hero.  Tom Cruise as a bad guy is great-he always plays the hero and this was a turn for the better.  The direction was great and the ending is perfect.
B00005JN2X|5.0|From my point of view, the premise seemed to be very repetitive and potentially boring, but that all changed on August 12, when I went to see this on a rainy day. Don't get me wrong - the plot does involve five murders by hitman Tom Cruise, playing Vincent, who is driven around by Jamie Foxx, playing Max, but there is a lot more to it than that.  <br /> <br />The dialogue is outstanding. Foxx, brilliantly cast, is funny at times, but he doesn't come off as trying too hard to be funny, which is what Will Smith is often guilty of. Cruise, playing a villain for once, shows his dark side and turns in a more than convincing performance. This movie, like other Michael Mann movies, relies on good dialogue. There are extended scenes of just talking, but they are so well-written that you don't even notice. A lesser director would have deleted scenes in favor of the more action-packed ones. Now, there is a lot of action and violence, but it never really gets carried away, and it never is without a point. Vincent tries to convince Max that what he is doing isn't all bad, even though it is murder. This is crucial because it shows the character development. <br /> <br />Also of note, the scenery and cinematography of South Central Los Angeles is beautiful. The more violent scenes are incredibly real, on the same level of being real that Saving Private Ryan was on. It may have just been because I was in a theater, but the gunshots sounded real, and the way Tom Cruise handled himself as a marksman made him look like a real hitman. That's something that you can't train for. You either have it or you don't. <br /> <br />And, there were cops in this movie that were chasing after the cab, but only for a very brief part of the movie, so that it didn't end up being like another one of those cat and mouse movies that I grow quite tired of. Yet, at the same time, there still are lot of thrilling action sequences. This truly is one of the best movies that I ever saw.
B00004RF83|5.0|This is a terrific movie with a terrific director's commentary on DVD.  Excellent cast, including John Houseman's first acting gig.<br /><br />I'm not sure how much of the movie works without the commentary - the film takes place in the \\"near future\\" a few years after it was made in 1963 - Frankenheimer's commentary makes it clear what props (like the videoconferencing) would have seemed futuristic at the time.<br /><br />The film is fascinating on many levels.  For example, I can imagine why Richard Nixon would think that recording all Oval Office conversations would be a good idea, if he had seen this film (which I imagine he had).<br /><br />Many similarities in direction and photography to The (original) Manchurian Candidate, which is also an excellent DVD.
B00008RH3L|5.0|I loved the accents, the 1930's era slang, the action scenes, the plot! This is one of the best Mobster flicks in my opinion! It ranks up there with Good Fellas, Casino, The Godfather, etc. <br />You will probably have to watch it twice to fully understand the plot but this is a movie you want to watch more than once anyways! <br />Enjoy!
B0000027F3|1.0|JP slowly went down hill after the seventies and this album shows that they had failed tp keep up with the Metaliccas of the later genre.  The tracks on this CD like Painkiller and All Guns Blazing are just laughable.  If you are into stupid songs with silly play as fast as you can riffs by old rockers then buy this.  If you want to hear some decent Priest, go back 10 years.
B000063DFQ|4.0|In \\"Piece of Mind\\", the last piece of the classic line-up was added to the fold: Drummer Nicko McBrian, who became a great replacement for former skinsman Cliver Burr. Piece of Mind is the second appearance by classic vocalist Bruce Dickinson, and it was concieved on the heels of their international breakthrough \\"The Number of the Beast\\".  <br /> <br />\\"Where Eagles Dare\\" opens the album with a bang, a tense, increadibly fast slab of METAL with a great hook. \\"Revelations\\" is similar to the previous album's \\"Children of the Damned\\", but more complete. The third track is the hit single \\"Flight of Icarus\\", a wonderful song with a wonderful chorus, and lyrics about the ancient myth. After it is the pumping, fist-in-the-air anthem \\"Die With Your Boots On\\" (Check out the cover by power metal band Sonata Arctica, it is even BETTER), followed by the second single, the galloping war tale \\"The Trooper\\", a classic Maiden song, which has some great guitar work. While the past songs have all been kickass Maiden rock, the quality starts to decline from here (something which would become a bad habit later on, during the 90s). \\"Still Life\\" holds it's own, it's similar to something from their \\"Killers\\" album, but not wuite up to par to the previous songs. \\"Quest For Fire\\" and \\"Sun & Steel\\" are both filler tracks, not really much to either, the latter is much better but still not very good. The closer \\"To Tame a Land\\" is based on the classic novel Dune, and its on par with the beggining songs in the album, an intelligent epic with increadible guitar pieces. <br /> <br />\\"Piece of Mind\\" suffers as the only of the first 7 Maiden albums that has obvious filler, and also because it followed the previous year's smash hit and came before 1984's Masterpiece \\"Powerslave\\". Piece of Mind is a lower point from either album, and it is perhaps the, let's say, least-best of the first 7. However, the first 5 pieces and the closer alone make it worthwhile for fan of the band, as all 6 songs are someof Maiden's BEST.  <br /> <br />Where Eagles Dare- 10/10 <br />Revelations- 9/10 <br />Flight of Icarus- 10/10 <br />Die With Your Boots On- 9.5/10 <br />The Trooper- 10/10 <br />Still Life- 8/10 <br />Quest For Fire- 5/10 <br />Sun And Steel 6.5/10 <br />To Tame a Land- 9.5/10
B000286S8S|2.0|The biggest thing I noticed from listening to this album is that it sounds like two different bands.  It's almost as if Van Halen stepped down from being the back street raw metal band of the 70's/early 80's to some sort of mediocre glam rock band.  One things for sure, if they hadn't had such a good start then they wouldn't be going now.  Hagar has to be thankful to Mr Roth for that.
B000063DI9|5.0|Seventh Son of a Seventh Son was the last in a line of virtually universally aclaimed Albums that Iron Maiden churned out throughout the 80s. It was the last with the Classic Line-Up (Adrian Smith departed shortly after because of creative differences) and their last album of the Golden Decade for Metal; the 1980s. Seventh Son continued the path first explored on the previous album, 1986's \\"Somewhere in Time\\", which introduced heavy use of synths into the usual Maiden formula with succesful results. SSOASS improves on S.I.T.'s weaknesses by turning up the guitar sound that was downsized in said album. SSOASS was also something very new lyrics-wise, being the first solid Maiden concept album, and the story was made specifically for the album. It deals with a titanic struggle between good and evil revolving around the prophetic seventh son, the story's protagonist, who can either bring about the salvation of his people or their ultimate doom. <br /> <br />The album kicks off with an atmosphere-setting passage, just Bruce reciting a few lines accompanied by an acoustic guitar, before the adrenaline-filled opener \\"Moonchild\\" blasts out in full, synth-ridden glory. Like most songs on the album, Moonchild is far different from most other Maiden songs to date. Following \\"Moonchild\\" is the POWER Ballad \\"Infinite Dreams\\", a fan favourite. The next two cuts were the more famous singles: \\"Can I Play With Madness?\\", a synth-driven Pop song unlike anything Maiden has composed, and the more Rock N Roll \\"The Evil That Men Do\\", a fast, hard song that displays an increadible hook and poetic lyrics (Plus one of the best opening lines Maiden have penned: \\"Love is a Razor/And I Walk the Line on that Silver Blade\\"). They switch gears for the next song, the masterful Epic Title Track, sporting increadible musical passages and lyrical wonders. \\"Prophecy\\" is another different song, more of a \\"breather\\" after the last 3 songs (while still being pretty fast), with some extremely nice guitarmelodies. The last two songs are again, plain awesome Maiden. \\"The Clairvoyant\\" has a defiant tone and increadible bass-playing from Mr. Harris. \\"Only the Good Die Young\\" is another fast one, and while more \\"common\\" than the rest of the songs, it (like CLairvoyant) sports increadible lyrical insight and even a BASS SOLO from Steve. At the end of the song, th same lyrical passage from the beggining begins again, just Bruce and the acoustic. The cycle begins again.  <br /> <br />Seventh Son of a Seventh Son is the major peak in Maiden's career as it displays genius not only in its amazing instrumentation, but also because of it's lyrical value, and overall structures of every song. It's a concept album made up of songs that could work just as easily by themselves, not to mention nearly all the songs are distinct from any other Maiden era, all display something new that they hadn't tried before, or perfected in this release.  <br /> <br />This album is a must-have for Iron Maiden fans, as one of their most complete and successful. It's not only a cornerstone in Maiden career, but a cornerstone for Progressive Metal and conceptual albums as well, not to mention all of 80s Rock. It is simply fantastic. <br /> <br />Moonchild- 9.5/10 <br />Infinite Dreams- 9/10 <br />Can I Play With Madness?- 10/10 <br />The Evil That Men Do- 10/10 <br />Seventh Son of a Seventh Son- 9.5/10 <br />Prophecy- 8.5/10 <br />The Clairvoyant- 10/10 <br />Only the Good Die Young- 10/10
B00024BHTC|1.0|Heard it all before.  Opera and Metal, yawn yawn yawn.  You'd think some of these reviewers had just been born.... This album is crap.  Luckily we needed a new frisbe, so thank you Nightwish.
B000063DHL|5.0|For their 6th release, Maiden opted to expand their musical soundscape with synthesizers, which were actually all the rage in the 80s. The idea made many fans feared an over-commercialization of their sound; that the band was selling out. 1986's \\"Somewhere in Time\\" proved the fears wrong, and the merging between true Heavy Metal and synthesizers was a great success.  <br /> <br />The first song and title track \\"Cought Somewhere in Time\\" was a powerful 7- minute Epic that serves to sum up the album. Next is the hit single, and one of my favourites, \\"Wasted Years\\" a melancholic Adrian Smith-penned power ballad. \\"Sea of Madness\\" is a very heavy song, probably the heaviest in the album. Following it is the \\"short\\" epic Heaven Can Wait, a concert favourite and shout-along anthem that will stay in your head for days. \\"Lonliness of the Long Distance Runner\\" is an obvious throw-back at 70s-Prog-Rock Gods Yes's \\"Long Distance Runaround\\". While the lyrics are very weak, the upbeat solo, great intro and solid chorus save the song. The album's other single \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\" is another slow melancholic song, but much heavier than Wasted Years and just as intense. \\"De Ja Vu\\" is a light, fast rocker of the album, good concept too and great intro. Like nearly all Maiden Closers, the last song on this album is the epic \\"Alexander The Great\\", a powerful finish to the album, displaying spoken word intros and a marital-pace clean-guitar intro before kicking into the historical biographic Epic. <br /> <br />The production is very different from any other, and the guitars are pushed back and very fuzzy, yet the synths don't take over the sound either, while Bruce also sounds distant. If it doesn't read well, don't worry, the effect makes for a very interest sound that is increadibly \\"epic\\" and surprisingly fresh. The sound would be similar in the next album, but not as drastically different. <br /> <br />While Somewhere in Time does not surpass the increadible and straight-forward \\"Powerslave\\" nor it's own synth-laden follow-up \\"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\\", it is nonetheless one of the quintessential Maiden releases that features many great songs plus a side to Maiden that is different from any other of their albums. <br /> <br />Caught Somewhere in Time- 10/10 <br />Wasted Years- 10/10 <br />Sea of Madness- 8.5/10 <br />Heaven Can Wait- 10/10 <br />Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner- 9/10 <br />Stranger in a Strange Land- 9/10 <br />De Ja Vu- 9/10 <br />Alexander the Great- 8.5/10
B0001Z52RU|4.0|The idea of traveling through time has been a staple of science fiction since H.G. Wells's time. Who wouldn't want to go back and be a part of history in the making or altering those situations that led to the more horrific events of the past?<br /><br />Ashton Kutcher stars as a young man that makes several life-changing \\"treks\\" to his past, only to discover that each one brings about an \\"alteration\\" more devastating than the next. As each journey brings about unwanted circumstances, Kutcher's \\"Evan Treborn\\" becomes more and more determined to right each wrong, thus creating a totally seductive viewing experience for the viewer.<br /><br />In all honesty, I didn't expect much in the acting department from the star of \\"That 70's Show\\". I was pleasantly surprised to discover Kutcher the actor as opposed to the \\"star/boy toy\\" of tabloid fame. He is actually quite good and carries the film quite well. The marvelous Amy Smart gives ample support, as she must play variations of the \\"Kayleigh\\" character.<br /><br />Also remarkable are the young actors that play the respective parts of the main characters as young teens. John P. Amedori (\\"Evan at 13), Jesse James (\\"Tommy\\"), and Kevin Schmidt (thirteen-year-old \\"Lenny\\"). Melora Walters as Evan's mother goes through various changes, also, and excels at each.<br /><br />Spoiler: The film sports some intriguing special effects, one of which allows the viewer to see Kutcher as a paraplegic. This is one good camera trick.<br /><br />The \\"Infinifilm\\" format is excellent, offering revealing production commentary and shot-by-shot storyboards of key scenes, theatrically shown or on the \\"director's cut\\".<br /><br />Speaking of the \\"director's cut\\", its ending is far more satisfying than the one shown in movie houses, as the director's commentary reveals.<br /><br />All in all, while not a great film, \\"The Butterfly Effect\\" is a good popcorn flick and one that, had I seen in the theaters, I would've enjoyed.
B0002DB50E|5.0|This was the film that opened up the very strange but fascinating world of David Cronenberg to me.  I have seen nearly all his films since then, and this remains one of his boldest and his best.   <br /> <br />It is a very difficult film to describe, since it uses the now familar Cronenberg trick of showing us everything from the point of view of one unreliable character.  Max Renn owns a sleazy cable channel and is looking for the next big thing - and stumbles across Videodrome which may (or may not) cross the line into snuff film. <br /> <br />From this rather unappetizing plot device, Cronenberg goes off in a number of directions.  The movie initially did not get good reviews and I think people could not see what Cronenberg was really doing here.  He is criticizing, often with dark comedy, our media saturated world, how the media can program us just as we can program a VCR, and how the line between reality and \\"media reality\\" can quickly be blurred.  But it is a horror film, complete with conspiracy theory and a horrific medical by-product to give the film a very dark undertone. <br /> <br />There are some jaw dropping visuals here, from breathing VCR tapes to melting body parts.  Unlike many of his fellow horror directors, I never felt Cronenberg gives us pure shock effects - he always uses his gore as symbolism or as punctuation to tell us we have hit a major segment of his film. Let me add Cronenberg got strong performances from the reliable James Woods and to everyone's surprise Deborah Harry from the rock group Blondie.  <br /> <br />OK, some of the character names are a little too cutesy, and who knows what in the end is actually happening here at times.  But the film has not lost its ability to shock and be thought provoking.  Indeed, in a time of Reality TV, 100 plus cable channels, and non stop 24 hour political spin cycles, Videodrome seems ahead of its time and almost prophetic in places.
B00003CXCT|4.0|The rumors are true about this DVD set being a \\"Special Special Edition\\".  More changes have been made to the original Star Wars trilogy since 1997.  Recently, many images, sounds, and even a full-length copy of Return of the Jedi have been floating around on the internet, all of which confirm the changes.    Like it or not, here are some of the major alterations:    A New Hope  1. Greedo still shoots first, but it is slightly improved.  2. Jabba the Hutt is still in the film, but has been completely redone.  3. The lightsabers have been enhanced; they are no longer white rods in certain scenes.    The Empire Strikes Back  1. Actor Ian McDiarmid now appears as The Emperor via hologram, with new dialogue and different music.  2. Actor Temuera Morrison now provides the voice of Boba Fett.    Return of the Jedi  1. Naboo has been added to the end celebration montage.  2. Actor Hayden Christensen appears as the ghost of Anakin Skywalker at the end of the film.
B000286S8S|5.0|This rating is to offset the \\"How could they leave out ______?\\" and the \\"DLR or Sammy is the one and only Van Halen.\\" Otherwise, 4 stars.
B00005JN2F|3.0|My husband and I were really looking forward to this movie - even re-watched the DVD of Bourne Identity, but the jumpy camera work was hugely distracting and DETRACTING. <br /> <br />Matt Damon portrays the tortured protagonist just fine. Brian Cox, Franka Potente, Joan Allen were all up to their roles. Julia Stiles was criminally underused. Karl Urban was appropriately fierce but am I the only one who thinks he continually (in LOTR also!) looks like someone is holding a small turd under his nose? <br /> <br />The plot's fairly convoluted but we managed to unravel it in the after-show discussion. The big thing that keeps me from rating this higher is the horrible camera work. To think it was done purposely just blows my mind. Why do all these great stunts and then not allow us to see them? Phooey. <br /> <br />So - story and acting a 4, camera work a 2 or less. Comes out to 3 stars, which is a cryin' shame. <br /> <br />
B00003CXXP|3.0|Spielberg's movie is eventually rather slow and convoluted after a promising start. It becomes a tad pretentious, sends mixed messages and fails to hang together as a coherent vision. Throw in the typical Spielbergian tendency to sentimentalism, and you end up with a fairly uneven film. <br /> <br />It will disappoint those who expected a pacey action-thriller, but as a futuristic fantasy/fairy-tale variation of Pinocchio, it certainly maintains a genuine charm and sense of enchantment. And despite its hopelessly tangled thematic web, it is full of points of interest that will no doubt draw me back to it again.
B000066NW0|4.0|Yes everyone, Avril Lavigne sings pop music. No need to continue writing \\"reviews\\" trying to educate us conformist, moronic zombies. Believe me, we know already. Everyone knows. Referring to her as a poseur? Well that doesn't make much sense, and just make you sound unintelligent. As far as I recall, the closest she's come to claiming herself as a \\"punk\\" was revealing that she told record executives that she wanted to \\"rock out\\" a bit on her album when they asked her to sing \\"Celine Dion-type\\" songs. So technically, if she were to be a self-proclaimed anything, she would be a self-proclaimed rocker, not a self-proclaimed punk. Also, since the punk accusations arose, she's repeatedly stated in interviews that, in fact, she doesn't think of herself as punk, pop, rock, or any other specific genre. Rather, she's claimed to be nothing more or less than herself.  <br /> <br />'Let Go' isn't amazing, but it's good for a debut. The lyrics are a little \\"high school\\", and the music is simple. But the hooks are catchy, and just try getting the choruses out of your head. This is definitely an album to check out, although don't expect to be blown away. Judging from this album, Avril Lavigne is certainly an artist to watch. I expect she'll get better with age. She has a fantastic, unique voice, in future projects if she can improve on her lyrics, and come up with more original melodies, I suspect she'll be a force to be reckoned with. <br /> <br />The album starts out on a strong note with 'Losing Grip'. This is an up-beat, catchy track. The most rock-influenced song on this pop album, Avril sings about how angry she is with someone after they left her all alone in a place where she felt uncomfortable, scared and which she was unfamiliar with. 'Complicated' would be a good second track if it hadn't been so over-played. Curse Canadian Content and it's silly 35% requirement. It forces us all to listen to every new Avril Lavigne, Sarah McLachlan, or Barenaked Ladies song a million times a day. I blame CanCon for altering 'Complicated' from a fun, infectious single that I actually quite liked the first million-or-so times I heard it, into a painfully annoying track that I always seem to skip. The third track is 'Sk8er Boi', this is the worst song on the album. The first couple of times I listened to it, I really liked it, but upon further attention, it became average, at best. It's a very juvenile song about a girl who refuses to go out with a, you guessed it, \\"sk8er boi\\", then regrets it when he grows up to become a rock star.  <br /> <br />'I'm With You' is among the best on the album. It's the first ballad on 'Let Go', and one of my personal favourite songs on it. Upon listening to the ultra-simple lyrics \\"Isn't anyone trying to find me/Won't somebody come take me home\\" I had no choice but to fall in love with this track. The fifth track, 'Mobile', brings us back to the faster songs on the album. It's about how Avril feels her life is constantly changing. She refers to herself as a \\"mobile\\" because she frequently feels that she's \\"spinning 'round with mixed feelings\\". 'Unwanted' is a very anger-driven song. With prolonged notes and music slightly bordering on dark and melodic (in comparison to the rest of the album), it's one of the stand out tracks. The seventh track is the sweet, somewhat hopeless 'Tomorrow'. It's the second slow song on 'Let Go', and Avril's voice sounds exquisitely innocent, yet grown-up on it. On 'Anything But Ordinary', Avril reveals her dreams of leading a life distinct from the norm. Stating all the weird things she does, such as laughing herself to sleep and driving fast \\"just to feel the danger\\".  <br /> <br />I absolutely love the up-beat 'Things I'll Never Say'. Somehow it finds a way to incorporate all the different emotions teenagers can feel around the guy or girl they have feelings for. Lyrically, Avril wishes she could tell things to her \\"crush\\" that she knows she could never say. 'My World' could almost bedescribed as Avril's theme song, if that makes sense. In the up-tempo, pop track, Avril tells all who'll listen just what her life growing up was like in a small town (Napanee, Ontario). The eleventh song on 'Let Go' is 'Nobody's Fool'. Lyrically, Avril refuses to let anyone change her, stating, \\"If you're trying to turn me into someone else/It's easy to see that I'm not down with that/I'm not nobody's fool\\". 'Too Much To Ask' is a great, slower song about being let down by someone. Avril belts out lyrics about being annoyed with somebody who always feels sorry for himself and refuses to smile or laugh. The album ends on a sweet note with 'Naked'. It's about being so comfortable around someone that she feels as though she's naked, but doesn't seem to mind. It refers to trust and being able to be yourself. <br /> <br />All-in-all, 'Let Go' is a strong pop debut. I'd recommend checking it out if you're a fan of Michelle Branch, Chantal Kreviazuk, or Liz Phair. Avril doesn't quite have the genius song-writing skills just yet, but I'm guessing that by her third album, she'll have gained a ton of experience, and be unstoppable. <br /> <br />THE FINAL VERDICT: 80%
B00005JMUA|3.0|The most entertaining parts of this film are the various flashback scenes, one of which is an outtake available on this DVD.  While the flashbacks were all clever, I thought the main story moved too slowly, particularly the conclusion.  By the time I got to the big showdown scene, I figured that (a) the Bride would kill Bill, (b) Bill would kill the Bride, (c) they'd waste each other, or (d) they'd agree to coexist.  But 20 minutes into that scene, I'd almost completely lost interest in the outcome.  When Bill gets into the discussion of how Clark Kent is really Superman's secret identity and Superman is his real self, I was shaking my head and looking at the time.  I just wanted them to get on with it.  Didn't care what happened to the characters. <br /> <br />Vol 1 was an entertaining action film, and much of Vol 2 is good, but the conclusion really didn't do it for me.
0385512104|4.0|This book was so original!  I picked the book up only because it was a Today Show Book Recommendation.  It was very good.  Mark Haddon is an excellent author.  It must have been very difficult to tell the entire story through the eyes of Christopher, an autistic boy.  By reading this book, you come to realize how these children go through their days - from their thought processes to their unbearable touches.  It was a serious book, but there were lots of funny parts to chuckle over.  Overall, this was a great book; a little predictable at times, but still very good.  It has all the emotions of a good book - sadness, laughter, and joy.
B00005QG9J|5.0|This is my ultimate basking in the sunshine album! I love the vibe of this Incubus album - it's aquatic sounding guitar riffs and mixes of oriental tones gives the album it's more mellow sound - probably due to the inspiration as the album in it's entirity was written and recorded in a beach house in California!! Brandon pays homage to the surferville culture with lyrics such as \\"I lean against the wind, pretend that I am weightless and in this moment I am happy...I wish you were here\\"...If, like me, you can't afford to go to CA and find a Surfer's paradise...Buy this album - get to an ocean - and totally hippie out with a cup of tea !! <br /> <br />Includes hits \\"Wish You Were Here\\", \\"Nice to Know You\\" and \\"Are You In?\\" <br /> <br />Personal highlights are \\"Circles\\" \\"Just A Phase\\" and \\"11AM\\". <br /> <br />
0689829590|5.0|I have 20-month old twins who absolutely adore this book.  We got it out from the library and they've wanted me to read it to them every day...many times a day.  They love the pictures and how the pages flip up or down.  They are facinated with the moon and the stars.  They may not exactly understand yet what this book is about, however, it gets them interested in reading.  We own many of Eric Carle books and this is one of my (and their)personal favorites.  It really is timeless.  A great story! <br /> <br />I would be careful letting your really young children play with this one alone since the pages are thin and easily ripped.  It is one to read to them and put away after you're done.
B000002HJR|4.0|Everyone told me what a classic album that this was...I downloaded the MP3s not too long ago and realized that I really needed to buy this.  So I went out and finally got it and it certinatly is a classic.  This album really sounds like Pantera, Black Sabbath, and Lynard Skynard put in a blender.  It doesn't get much better than this.  The most notable tracks are \\"Temptation's Wings\\", \\"Eyes of the South\\", \\"Losing All\\", and \\"Stone the Crows\\".  One thing about Nola is there is absolutly no filler...every track is undoubtably album worthy.  You can tell they had fun making this album and jamming out to the tracks.  What stopped me from giving this CD a 5 star rating is basically just that the lyrics aren't up to par with the musicianship on here, I personally can't relate to the southern themes.  I'm not one for all that southern pride/confederacy shxt.  None the less...it matches the feel of the album.  If you are a fan of Pantera or any classic metal, this is a must.  Pick it up.
6302642299|5.0|I loved this series as a kid and now my toddler enjoys them.  This video contains two stories from the little mermaid the series.  In Whale of a Tale Ariel finds a lost killer whale. This features the songs, \\"Just a little love\\" and \\"You've got to be you.\\"  In the second story 'Urchin' Ariel meets an orphaned mer-boy.  This story features a song called \\"Lobster Mobsters Mob\\"  You'll love the new songs and stories!
1594200106|4.0|The story is a classic whodunit with some clever touches and twists thrown in.  The author starts out as if he meant to write a major work of literature.  He tries very hard and, for a while, succeeds. The imaginative plot, florid language and moody atmosphere hooks the reader early.  Unfortunately, the author runs out of steam about half way through.  This is not to say that the story degenerates.  The pace continues and the book remains a good read to the very end.  But the nature of the work changes; it turns into a popular \\"novela\\" with all the expected elements: love, sex, baudy humor, violence, etc.  One even finds oneself reading faster. Each reader can decide which half s/he prefers.  I would have gladly exchanged the last 100 pages for a shorter, tighter story in the opening style of the work.  It coulda been a contender!
B000099T2L|5.0|Dancing dancing lalalalala... oops! Hello all! This song is great and smoother but she should have been going back with Destiny's Child but this CD is not that bad but try to keep up your hard work is all I can say!
B000286RZM|5.0|The Will to Death has got to be one of my favorite albums. This is one of those cd's you buy and listen to the first time and go \\"Huh?\\" And then there's one song that strikes you and makes you think the rest can't be all that bad. So you listen to it again. You find  more songs that you absolutely fall in love with, and by the thrid time you've listened to the whole album you're completely convinced that these tracks are the most mind-blowing creations you've ever heard.It may all seem like a slight dissapointment and a mere silence killer as background music at first, but continuing those thoughts would really be a sin. <br />Though John Frusciante has decided not to spend as much time fiddling with his music as much as he did on Shadows Collide With People, he has managed to reach perfection through imperfection, creating another world to step into through the sounds of his songs. Every time you let the disc spin you discover new things you haven't heard before, subtle second interpretations...extra emotions. This album makes my mind stop working, kind of makes me feel like I'm floating, a feeling of utter relaxation and inner peace overcomes me. I can sing along... but processing thoughts doesn't happen. It's all about emotion and living the music.  <br />If there is anyone that lives, breathes and feels music it's John. And he gives you that feeling, too... which I find uncomprehendeble. I don't know how he does it, but he made it happen. I love this album. It's fantastic.
B00005OM4N|1.0|Puh-leaze! Get a life, Britney you are nothing but a trash! Guess what, Britney??? I only like ONE song of yours is \\"Sometimes\\" but the other rest SUCKS! I think you need to quit a singer because you are nothing but a trash! Go get some help! You tried to be sexy, you tried to show off that you are a HOT looking and so on but please - your ugly as hell. All Britney the nasty freak fool fans - sorry about this message but she is not worth my time so PEACE!
B0002IU988|5.0|This is an awesome work from the former members of Creed and the new addition at vocals. Tremoti is at the top of his game and the drums actually do more then the typical 4/4 beat of modern alternative rock. This is much heavier then Creed and seems much more musically talented. I do not think, however, that there will be as many hits on this one. It seems to be too good for modern radio. If you were to listen to this and then say 'three days grace' you could tell who the real musicians are. Alterbridge is indeed leaps and bounds better then creed. <br /> <br />Song Reviews <br />Find The Real 5/5 <br />- This is what Creed should have been, awesome solo and great vocal work. I like the drum fills <br />One Day Remains 3/5 <br />- This song is all right though I dont like the feel that much it seems to punky or atmospheric or something I dont really like it that much <br />Open Your Eyes 5/5 <br />- The Single. Right this song is awesome and easily hummable. I really like this song. The solo is killer. <br />Burn It Down 5/5 <br />- I like the bass in this song and the solo at the end is awesome. Good vocal work <br />Metalingus 5/5 <br />- Interesting Song. Heavier then creed and to a good effect. I must say that I like <br />Broken Wings 5/5 <br />- Probably the second song. Very radio friendly yet skilled. A great song. <br />In Loving Memory 4/5 <br />- A good song. Not too much to say about it. Sounds sorta of like creed, in a good way <br />Down To My Last 3/5 <br />- An unmemorable song, allright though <br />Watch Your Words 5/5 <br />- The vocal work is awesome on this song. Good work <br />Shed My Skin 6/5 <br />- Probably my favorite song on this CD, headbanging and singable. I like this one alot <br />End Is Here 4/5 <br />- An all right closer of a song. I think its pretty good.  <br />This album is awesome. I give it an A+. Every song is listenable and enjoyable and I dont skip any tracks on this disc. I recommend it to all who are tired of the trash currently on the radio and MTV.
B000092ZYX|4.0|radiohead is one of my favorite bands. but uh. their older stuff is better. bye. :D
B0000584V3|5.0|Where to begin... this album is perhaps the best work of art I have let enter my system. Very heavy, yet beautful beyond reason. The guitarists of this band know how to rock yet they know how to make the most wonderful passages of acoustic brilliance. The drummer is perhaps a madman and the bassist is quite skilled and does actually add to music in a melodic way unlike many metal bands today. This music does not come to me as Death Metal as Opeth originated as. This comes to me as music. The best tracks on \\"Blackwater Park\\" are the title track, Harvest, and Bleak. I recommend this to any fan of music in general and i require this of any metal fan. This is truly a masterpiece. I am blessed to have heard it.
B00006JKLI|5.0|This review is about the DVD-Audio version - if you're even looking at this version, I'll bet you're already familiar with the music. <br />Let me tell you, if you've got the right equipment, then you really have to get it!   The sound quality is amazingly clear - I've purchased other DVD-A's where the enhanced sound showed up limitations in the source tape or unintentionally showed where seperate musical parts came in and out.  Not this one!  Right from the beginning, when that famous acoustic guitar intro kicks in, you'll be impressed by use of 'space' in the sound.  The surround tracks has a real feel of space without it sounding like the remixers were trying to show off.   I can't reccomend it enough - I'd been listening to this album for years, but hearing the DVD-A gives me a whole new level of appreciation for it. <br /> <br />I have to admit, it took me awhile before I broke down and bought this.  I can understand if any of you are hesitant to buy another version of this CD, much as you may like it.  But now I wish I'd bought it much sooner.  So in a word, BUY IT!  It's definitely worth the money!   If you're buying it for the first time, and have the right equipment, THIS is the version to get.  And if you already own it............ well, it's got the full-length version of \\"America\\" as a bonus track, and it's not any more expensive than the \\"Fragile\\" *CD* remaster, so what could possibly be holding you back??? :)
B00009UW0N|5.0|Halloween is still one of my favorite movies and an outstanding low-budget (even for its day) production.  I first saw the movie on a free promotional week of HBO on Halloween Night, 1979.  I had seen the 1st edition paperback displaying a sheet covered figure with the jack-o-lantern head on both covers.  It intrigued me immensely but I was \\"too young\\" to read \\"murder books.\\"  I was about 12 years old.  So when my parents went to sleep for the night I turned off the lights, ate my trick-or-treat candy, and watched the forbidden R-rated Halloween on our 25\\" color console.  And that, I think, is the whole appeal of Halloween to the die-hard fans of today: we remember what USED to scare us.  Why was it such a powerful production?  Because it was so down-to-earth and real; so real, in fact, that when the movie ended I found myself wondering whether or not a human being could be so seriously injured that many times and then get up and walk away.  I pondered whether any of the wounds the killer received until the finale actually were fatal.  Silly lines or not, the characters were believable.  I knew girls like that (the post-hippi generation was a strange one) and lived in a similar neighborhood.  I could readily identify with the falling leaves and rain, the decorations on the houses, huge dark lawns, etc.  Halloween sparked such a mass of rip-offs and gore slashers that the idea of what true horror was shifted dramatically from that which could almost happen to that which is absolutley impossible and unbeleivable.  I suspect that the only people Halloween could still stir up are pre-teen adolescents who have never witnessed horror or viloence in films...(these days?)...ain't gonna happen.<br /><br />For those of you who have never watched Halloween the most modern film I can compare it to is The Ring.  It built its horror more on suspense and the expectation of the unexpected.  It also gave very limited and brief glimpses of the stalker, thus building viewer apprehension.  The soundtrack is repetitious and monotonous, but quite invoking.  It sucked us right into the film with the characters; we were one of the unsuspecting teens.<br /><br />Halloween is more a film for history buffs and is really no good at all for scaring anyone these days.  But it is a great movie to share with friends during the Halloween season, and I highly recommend buying it, either in the H25 special edition, original edition, or extended theatrical original (with the 1980 made-for-television scenes) thrown in/my personal favorite.  It is a highly enjoyable and well produced film, but best suited to share shelf-space with Psycho, Amelie, Ran, Lillies of the Field, The King and I, and other timeless classics, rather than with later horror flicks.<br /><br />The quality of this disc will not disappoint you.  If you are a fan of other Halloween films you will see a dramatic but refreshing difference.  If you have never seen it and are just curious, then by all means rent it first and don't expect anything more than a simply entertaining movie.  It's dated and somewhat awkward but not cheesy (well...maybe once or twice, but it passes quickly).  I have several versions and will continue watching and sharing them, especially on Halloween.sion.  The soundtrack is repetitious and monotonous, but quite invoking.

B00006AFUR|4.0|It all started when the song \\"Capricorn\\" came up on RockNews' list of upcoming rock songs.  The names of both the band and the song conjured up the sounds of 311, Sublime and other punk/ska bands.  I like both of the aforementioned bands, but not enough to actually look for other bands with a similar sound.  But I'm sure I had no other things to do, so I gave the song a shot, despite these less-than-promising preconceptions.<br /><br />To my fortune, and grateful surprise, I was very, very wrong.<br /><br />30 Seconds to Mars is not like 311 and less like Sublime.  This band is furious, and has a unique power that relies less on speed and more on vocal and melodic depth.  Jared Leto's screaming (yet very listenable) vocals, gripping and powerful, seem to fit perfectly with the pounding guitars and relentless drums.  Songs like \\"Buddha for Mary\\" and \\"Oblivion\\" seem to have a bottomless fountain of power.  Yes, these guys don't stop.  While they can have spacey interludes in between furious choruses, the songs do seem to flow.  No, there's no soft song as most bands tend to have (Disturbed's \\"Darkness\\", Cold's \\"Bleed\\" and Stone Sour's \\"Bother\\"), but this shouldn't discourage you from listening to this band.<br /><br />Their depth (I don't know it it's produced by the guitar sounds, or the combination of everything) is a sound that I can't find in any other band.  Maybe if the Offspring were ever to leave punk rock behind and adopt a nu-metal sound, this is what they'd sound like.  If you're ever in the mood to pound your head into the wall, while at the same time enjoying a band for their musical craftsmanship, you shouldn't hesitate to listen to these guys.  Both the pace at which the songs unravel and the fury with which they are delivered are factors that should not be overlooked.  Happy listening.<br /><br />Recommendations: \\"Capricorn\\", \\"Oblivion\\", \\"Buddha for Mary\\", \\"End of the Beginning\\"
B00005JMUA|5.0|I sure hope that tarantino releases these two movies as a set around christmas time. Even better would be one or two dvd's of extras such as interviews deleted scenes etc. I read somewhere that during the making of kill bill that tarantino shot hours of footage that obviously wasn't used for the theatrical or dvd markets. Hopefully the extra footage will be included whenever the two movies are packaged together.
B00005ATQD|2.0|Just about every director produces a turkey at least once in his career, even near geniuses like Hitchcock, but this thing was Kubrick's last movie and that makes it very sad. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman play a husband and wife who seem to have gotten bored with one another but their on screen chemistry was so non existent the viewer was left wondering when these two characters had ever been in love in the first place.  <br />Nicole's character informs her husband that she had an elaborate erotic fantasy about another man. Tom's character, Dr. Bill reacts like a 15 year old boy instead of a sophisticated man. He spends the rest of the movie looking to get even and blunders into one sexually charged situation after another. None of these situations is ever carried to fruition and the most famous scene of the movie---the orgy turns dangerous for him. <br /> <br />Now about that orgy scene. Why did all the women look like starved horses? Perhaps it was Kubrick's little joke but all the female orgy attendees reminded me of the dead woman in the bath tub from The Shining. Has an orgy seemed ever been filmed in a more unerottic way? Dr. Bill doesn't seemed shocked, amused or even excited so much as analytical. The whole scene, and indeed most of the movie seemed cold and silly in turns.  <br /> <br />There are two really good scenes and that's it. The first is when the gossipy desk clerk falls for Dr. Bill's charms and tells all about the strange men who took the doctor's musician friend away and the second is when a hard looking man follows Dr. Bill throughout a remarkably empty and sanitized looking New York street.  <br /> <br />By the time the movie ends I didn't care about silly Dr. Bill or his frosty wife or their marriage or even what he was going to do about the possibly criminal aftermath of the orgy. As much as I loved Kubrick's work and as much as I'd like to say otherwise, Eyes Wide Shut stinks.
B00005JN2X|3.0|Interesting premise for a movie. Assassin gets a taxi to drive him around town to make hits. Of course, the obvious question is why doesn't he drive himself. But then the movie hints that 'Vincent' may have intended to frame the driver for the murders after and make it look like a mass murder/suicide. Except it would've been pretty obvious that the murder victims were all linked and the taxi driver wouldn't have had the knowledge or motive to go around killing them.     Anyways, an entertaining movie. Tom Cruise is great. And I was looking forward to watching Jamie Foxx. I was half expecting him to start singing at some point in the movie \\"Oh I'ma man of many wishes I hope my preminition misses\\". Those of you who watch the Jamie Foxx show will know what I'm talking about. Nice to see him in a serious role.     Usually, I don't particularly care for movies where the entire movie only spans a small amount of time. And this movie all occurs in a few hours of one night. But this movie was okay. Vincent was indeed an interesting character. I just have a final thought:     1) Did anyone else notice how short Tom Cruise's trousers were?
B0002EXH5O|1.0|I bought four other Megadeth remasters and was extremely satisfied.  Rust in Peace is a masterpiece, and probably the best Megadeth album.  Instrumentally the remastered album sounds good.  I would give it five stars based on that.  The vocals on Take No Prisoners, Five Magics, and Lucretia, though, were redone.  Why Dave?  The new vocals are nothing short of offensive.  I can see no reason, short of not having the original recordings, to re-sing ANY song.  If he did not have them, which is inconceivable, he should have left the songs alone.  If anyone wants to find out how to ruin a good album, this is the example.  If you have the original don't waste your money here, the bonus tracks aren't worth it either.
0790730960|4.0|Batman Returns is a perfect film to watch during the holiday season as the winter/Xmas atmosphere that Burton creates for Gotham City is wonderful. It's weird that Warner decided to release this as a summer film. It doesn't fit.<br /><br />But what's even weirder, when you consider the content of this film, is that it was aimed at families. An upper-class family throws their mutant baby down the sewer, a socio-phobic billionaire dresses up in leather as a flying rodent, a lonely secretary has a mental breakdown and dresses up in leather as a feline, and said grown-up mutant baby freak runs for political office. Not to mention the S&M subtext that Tim Burton somehow managed to get away with. His eccentric visual style fits this film best, and is the height of his career, IMO.<br /><br />This and the Dark Knight are the only true live-action incarnations of the comic-book character. True, Batman Returns is not as grown-up and serious as the Dark Knight, but it's a helluva lot atmospheric, and I just prefer the oddball character development here than in TDK. I rate them both equally, but scoring points on different levels.<br /><br />Darker and more violent than the first movie, the sense of Gothic pathos reaches a new high. I was quite keen on Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne (don't even get me started on George Clooney!), he displayed the right balance of weirdo loner and cool crime fighter. Michelle Pfieffer is great as Catwoman (much sexier and more 'realistically' cat-like), she wears that leather outfit better than Halle Berry. And Danny DeVito was so convincing as the Penguin that his scenes become disturbing to watch. Special mention must be made of Christopher Walken, who is brilliant as the spooky Max Shreck (if you think you recognize Chip Shrek it's none other than a very young Leatherface/Butterfinger).<br /><br />Danny Elfman's score is also even better than it was first time round. His powerful and engaging themes are way better than the dross that followed in the later Schumacher movies. This movie is the Batman phenomenon at its Zenith. Forget the following sequels and stick to the animated series after this. Christopher Nolan brought integrity back to the series, but before Schumacher destroyed it, Burton gave the original series integrity too.<br /><br />A great Xmas film, and my favorite Batman adventure.<br /><br />The Blu Ray looks amazing in 1080p 1.85:1 widescreen, with bold, deep blacks and near perfect colors. Plenty of extras too.This movie is the Batman phenomenon at its Zenith. Forget the following sequels and stick to the animated series after this.

B0002IU988|5.0|im not into write reviews but my god what a record in loving memory devasting and open yours eyes gives me chills everytime i hear it im not a devoted creed fan but alter bridge blows everything i hear!
B00027JZ3E|5.0|Plain and simple, I LOVE this movie. I have watched it a zillion times over the past 15 years and I never get tired of looking at it. It's very entertaining and has a kick ass soundtrack. I love everything about it from the style of the film, the clothes, the humor, the actors (from the oh-so-hot Keifer Sutherland and Jason Patric to the hilarious two Corey's), and of course the vampires. It's just so friggen COOL. It's a bit dated looking at it now, but I'm an 80s fanatic so that's fine with me. I can go on forever about it and I'm thrilled that a 2 disc special edition has finally been released. The Corey's commentary was a riot to watch and listen to. Too bad Jason Patric didn't show up for the featurette, but at least Keifer did. Any who loves this movie should pick up this new version of the dvd. Looks, sounds, and IS just awesome!
B00005JMUA|5.0|Yes, there's less action; yes, there's more talking. <br />I was actually a little worried that Vol. II wouldn't be on par with the first, as I heard - and rightly so - that this was much more of a talkative movie. Boy, was I wrong. I can't say whether I like Vol. I or II the best, but together they are just perfect!! <br />I especially liked the fact that there were lots of scenes that were leading to a big showdown, and then - with a quick twist - they end! No biggies!! No jumping-flying-cartwheeling stuff. <br />Some people, I see, were especially disappointed by the ending; however, I think it was SO fitting, symbolic and rather beautiful in a mysterious way  <br />!!!HERE COMES THE SPOILER!!!STOP HERE IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT!!! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />that Bill actually dies of a broken heart. <br /> <br />I wouldn't go as far as to say, that if you didn't like the first one, you should give this one a try; but if you did, there's nooooo way around this one!! <br /> <br />Bring on Vol. III, please
B00003CXMG|5.0|In order to understand this movie you actually just need to read it's soundtrack's lyrics. This movie is based on music, this movie revolves around music, this movie lives on it`s music. One might have the impression that the movie's makers had an easy one producing this movie, because never again did us humans have such a creative Phase as towards the end of the sixties, and the music makes this movie what it is. Anyhow, as we see on MTV every day, Music's effect on us is even bigger when it has a good music-video. Probably songs like \\"America\\" by Simon and Garfunkel , \\"Sparks\\" by the legendary The Who, \\"That's the way\\" by hard rock giants Led Zeppelin and ahead of all \\"Tiny Dancer\\" by Elton John wouldn't  give you the creeps as much without the movie being so damn good. <br />\\"Blue Jean Baby, L.A. Lady, seamstress for the Band.  Pretty eyed ,pirate smile, you'll marry a music man\\". Elton John's classic \\"Tiny Dancer\\" is about a girl in the sixties , a groupie. She was a Ballerina when she was young, but she decided ,as so many other girls did at that time to dedicate herself fully to \\"sex ,drugs and Rock'n'Roll\\" and to travel around with one of the much promising bands throughout the country from one festival to the other, from one arena to the other, from one booze-up and from one bed to the  next. Producer Cameron Crowe gives his \\"Tiny Dancer\\" the name of Penny Lane (Kate Hudson). She believes to be better than the \\"regular\\" Groupie, she actually doesn't consider herself to be one, but as someone who loves music and for this reason spends so much time with the band called \\"Stillwater\\". Indeed also she's just one of the toys available to play with for the band and the crew, especially for self-proclaimed band leader Russel Hammond (Billy Crudup) to sweeten the straining tour throughout the country. Joining them on their journey is the film's main character William Miller (Peter Fugit). He's actually one of the uncool kids as critic-mogul Lester Bangs (Philip Seymour Hoffman) tells him, but he knows everything about modern music and is very ambitous to become one of the big time music- critics. Against his mother Elaine's will (Frances McDormand) he joins \\"Stillwater\\" in order of the Rolling Stone Magazine.This actuality lets some of the band members have doubts in the boy ,the are scared that he might cause harm to their career by writing a negative report about them. Only Russel has trust in him and takes care of him, as well as Penny Lane. William becomes the first one to know her real name and they form a close friendship but to his annoyance she spends most of her nights with Russel ,which puts him in an odd situation. It comes to an embittered conflict in which William fights for his credibility towards the other band members, a battle against time and external pressure from the Rolling Stone bosses and a fight for Penny Lane's dignity and her love. On the other side stands the awareness on the fact that he's way to young for this situation, he's only fifteen,  that he should actually be doing his high school graduation that year (he skipped several classes when he was younger) and that he should become a lawyer, as his mother demands of him. She plays an important role in this context. A woman who's sickly anxious about her son's well being and prays every day that he's in good hands, a woman who has already been abandoned by her husband an her older daughter and who is about to loose the only person she has. Frances McDormand acts her role very convincingly with a lot of heart and passion. She knows how to express the sixtie's parent's fears. But she aswell has to accept that the times they are a changin and her son is changing ,too. Patrick Fugit has a great film-debut and embodies the uncool genius with the advantage of being loved by everyone he meets. The entire cast of the movie did a great job in expressing the time's feelings and emotions but the greatest contribution is done by the music. This movie has one ofthe best soundtracks I've ever heard in hollywood and gives you the creeps in many parts of the movie. It even reaches musical character when the entire tour bus starts singing \\"Tiny Dancer\\", after a huge clash between the band members , which immediatley lets the ice melt again. <br />And the times have changed again, but have they changed to the better? The times of the groupies are over, but is that a positive cognition? It was rebellious, it was a battle, it was escape, it was better than doing nothing.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|This album follows a more ambiant tone then it's predecessor, Mer De Noms. Maynard's vocals are more wispy and calm, the guitars go more for atmosphere than devastation and the rhythem flows with almost a tribal feel to it. A good album and something any fan of Tool or Maynard will enjoy. Not as good as Tool though and really dosen't even come close. I like APC and all but hope they wrap up their tour quickly because while this album is good, I would rather have one new Tool album than 20 new A Perfect Circle albums
B00008EY65|3.0|This is a fun mindless movie that emphasizes style over substance.  It could have been a half hour shorter and no one would have cared.  The movie itself moves a little slow but is generally good.  However, it does not rise above the level of a typical comic book movie.  The DVD is very nice with tons of extras and is jam packed full of great treats for fans of the movie.  If you liked the movie then buy the DVD but beware because an extended edition of the movie will be making its way into stores in the fall.
B000002OVJ|4.0|Without this album, nobody would ever have known about the great song \\"Summertime blues\\". Now let's look at the music. <br /> <br />Heaven and Hell: 8/10 <br />Entwistle was never as good of a songwriter as Pete. However, this is still a really good opening song. <br /> <br />I Can't Explain: 9/10 <br />This should be the opening track. This song has a great Kinks-style riff, a good solo, and it was the first song they ever recorded. Not Bad. <br /> <br />Fortune Teller: 7/10 <br />This song makes the Who sound like Rolling Stones-wannabes, the image they were trying to avoid at that time. <br /> <br />Tattoo: 8/10 <br />Where this song shines is the vocals. Great songwriting from possibly the world's best songwriter. An underrated Who song. <br /> <br />Young Man Blues: 10/10 <br />The Who play a jazz song in a heavy-metal style. This is just an amazing song. <br /> <br />Substitute: 10/10 <br />The coolest Who guitar riff. Period. The lyrics are great, Keith Moon is great, the bass is great. Awesome song. <br /> <br />Happy Jack: 6/10 <br />This does not deserve to follow \\"Substitute\\". That \\"lap, lap, lap\\" part sounds very stupid. This song was only played so that the Who could rest from a good song like Substitute. <br /> <br />I'm a Boy: 8/10 <br />Pete Townshend is a great songwriter. Period. <br /> <br />A Quick One, While He's Away: 7/10 <br />This song is OK. It's really six different songs in one, and it gets confusing at times. However, this song did show the world that songs didn't have to be 3 minutes long. <br /> <br />Amazing Journey/Sparks: 9/10 <br />This song is so underrated. Amazing Journey is one of the best songs on the \\"Tommy\\" album, plus \\"Sparks\\" is an amazing instrumental. <br /> <br />Summertime Blues: 10/10 <br />The Who play this song harder than anyone else. Also, I have never heard any other version with the deep vocals in between verses. The song, not written by the Who, belongs to them because they perform it so well. <br /> <br />Shakin All Over: 8/10 <br />This sounds like a late 70s/early 80s hard rock song, however it was written in the late 50s/early 60s, but not by the Who. They play it well though. <br /> <br />My Generation/See Me Feel Me: 9/10 <br />They extended this track way too long. After rocking versions of My Generation and See Me Feel Me(7 minutes) there are no more cool parts besides Pete using echo. <br /> <br />Magic Bus: 8/10 <br />The bass line sucks and the drumming sucks, but this song has a double meaning, a writing technique not used much before AC/DC. <br />
B00006CYAD|5.0|This is a really awesome album and i can't understend why so many people don't like it.I know that this a space for reviews, but some people that write here, are just showing how much they hate a band or other.Who doesnt know the cd and read the reviews is looking for something helpfull. So my review is: this is an awesome cd, the lyrics are amazing and pierre's voice is wonderful. There are some things that i don't like, as an example in the song \\"You don't mean anything\\", when they repeat many times \\"you don't,you don't,you don't,you don't\\"that's a bit boring, but i still love this cd.I hope that in their new album this kind of stuff doesnt happend anymore.
B000002H97|5.0|This is an excellent album, one of the greatest of the Rock/Metal genre and definitely the greatest of this band's achievements.  They displayed very good lyrical, as well as musical composition: hard hitting metal and thought provoking lyrics.  One thing I appreciated about the lyrics is that the intense negativity so prevalent on their other albums was not so present on this one.   <br />      <br />     This band has definitely put their fingerprint in music history.  Although, I do have one comment to make about the band in general: they are extremely overrated.  NO BAND deserves a day or an hour dedicated solely to them on every radio station in the country.  Metallica is by no means the most technically capable band, nor is their music in the slightest way comparable to Beethoven.   There are subtle classical influences weaved into their songs, yes, but to compare their compositions to Beethoven is a far cry from reality.  Anyone who would rate Metallica by comparison with Beethoven has obviously not listened with an educated ear to the music of Beethoven, or any other great classical composer for that matter. <br /> <br />     I felt this album deserved five stars; nevertheless, there are more technically skilled bands in the Rock/Metal genre.  Likewise, there are bands that have invented a more original sound than Metallica.  Due to advertising, (the Metallica day and hour on every radio station in the world), I am frequently irritated when I endeavor to introduce a new and talented band to the average radio listener and like an automated machine, programmed by the industry, they spew: \\"That sounds like Metallica!\\" at the fist hint of a heavy riff.   <br /> <br />     For what it's worth, my humble opinion of Metallica as a band is: great; and greatly overrated.  For those who would like to hear a Metal composition that can be remotely compared to Beethoven try: Symphony X: The Odyssey.   <br />
0375432302|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  It has sparked a lot of discussion about the church, Jesus, and I feel more importantly the female role in the world.  What ever your feelings about those issues I think this is a great read.  I do not think anyone could figure out his clues for Sophie and Robert - but no book is perfect.
B00004WG2X|3.0|In part because I saw the A&E version first this 1985 adaptation seemed far less exciting and much slower but it was worth watching because it has several scenes from the novel that were not in the A&E adaptation and the costuming and scenery were fabulous.  Personally, I thought the Elizabeth and Lydia characters were not as vibrant as they might have been.  Their personalities were not portrayed as strongly against each other as I would have prefered and the characters in the film were not as emotive as my imagination had Austin portraying them in the novel.  The women seemed like they were always smiling whether they were supposed to be angry, annoyed, whatever.  As far as the screen play was written, I would have preffered the characters ineractions and acting to portray their idiosyncracies rather than useing the dialogue to spell it out for me. <br />For instance, when Elizabeth explains to Wicham how Mr. Collins employment to DeBourg (spelling?) has turned him into a pompous, self-important man when it was already obvious.  And the writer also took extra pains to write in scenes showing how ridiculous and meddling Lady Catherine DeBourg is when I thought the actor did a fine enough job portraying this without manipulating my interpretation.  However, that aside, I thought the cast was perfect, I enjoyed Mr. Collins as a bumbling idiot and (forgive me Firth fans) I thought Darcy was fabulous and quite handsome.  I think I prefered this Lady Catherine DeBourg to  the A&E version but the confrontation between Lady Catherine and Lizzy was not as passionate as I had interpereted it in my mind while reading the book.
B0002IU988|5.0|I've read a few of the reviews already posted, and in some ways I'll have to disagree... Myles Kennedy has NO problem keeping up with Tremonti and company. Anyone saying that is stricktly comparing his style to that of Scott Stapp. These guys are opposite sides of the world. Stapp couldn't handle the change in lifestyle that success brought, it changed him, and you could hear it in his vocalizations and inflections as time went on in Creeds catalog. Myles already has that 'Rock Star' (..sorry Myles, couldn't help that one) vibe about him, he's comfortable in his skin, and with his place in the band. Fearless is how it sounds to me, he's not letting the shadow of Creed intimidate his  performance. The one thing that DID jump roght out at me is that his vocal style very closely resembles that of Ian Thornley of Big Wreck(think \\"The Oaf\\") <br />  Tremonti's guitar has never been better, to my ears. He's always had the shredder gene in him, but until now, kept it subdued. But he's released it with the one thing most shredders completely lose sight of, taste and songmanship. He's definately letting his metal roots show a LOT more than he ever could in Creed. <br />  The rhythm section is exactly what it should be: hard, heavy, and ROCK solid. Brian Marshall's switch to a 5-string bass has added a noticable depth and life to the music, more open than in the past, and Scott Phillips is, like his guitar-slinging bandmate Tremonti, at the top of his game. Neither overplaying, nor lacking in his duties, he makes a strong foundation for Alter Bridge to stand on. <br />  Far from a first trip to the studio for any member of the band, there's still a freshness to the music. Congradulations to Alter Bridge for taking what could have easily been 'Creed:Part 2' and making the music stand and shine on the strength of it's own merit. This is an entirely new unit, with new ideas of how the music should sound.   <br />
6303122647|5.0|I wouldn't say that this is my favorite movie, but it is a good anytime movie, no matter what time of year it is, this is another Tim Burton classic! {I like Oogie Boogie}.
B000003TAW|5.0|Seriously, read the CDnow review.  They link the name Weezer with the little rascals.  Whoever wrote that obviously knows nothing about Weezer.  They're obviously lying about Geffen saying anything about the name Weezer.  Rivers Cuomo used to make a wheezing noise as a child and kids made fun of him by calling him Weezer.  It's on the website.  It's in a zillion interviews.  Wait...I was reviewing the blue album.  Everyone elses favorite weezer album...my second favorite.  Weezer is plain old nerd rock done perfect.  Rivers Cuomo is genious.  Purty harmonies and rock driven guitar in the background of Rivers Cuomo telling the hardships of being a geek.  Being a geek myself I appriciate this.  Anyone who buys this thinking that it's cool and hip is an idiot.  Anyway, the little rascals thing in the CDnow review made my day.  I'm gonna go stroll through the park and giggle at the trees that look different from the other ones.
B00005JLSE|5.0|Chicago was something I was actually expecting something from... and I was right!! This is pretty neat.It just starts with the excellent musical and it goes on with the excellent movie. Need I say more?
B00003CWL6|5.0|This movie challenges all that is normal in American culture.  Kevin Spacey rocks it again with an amazing preformance.  And can't even describe all the amazing points of this movie...from the subtle(and sometimes blatant)imagery...to the pro-drug and sex submessages.  This is an all time classic and I recommend it to everyone.  I hope all that see this learn something.  I also like the dirty-old-man thing Spacey has going on.  That makes me laugh.  This is one of the small bits of joy in my life and I hope you appriciate it.
0790736039|5.0|I think many people will never look at clowns the same way again after they see IT. This is indeed creepy, but the ending is kind of disappointing. The movie is great, but the ending isn't that hot. Don't let this deceive you. You will want to see this anyway if you have not.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|There is something about this movie that just makes me watch it over and over. I guess because most of us can identify with either one of these characters. I now see Bill Murray in a different light. I'ts nice to see how two totally different people not only in age but character can find eachother and comfort eachother. Soul mates work that way and they don't always have to stay together to realize that they belonged together in another life or will meet again in the next. If your'e reading this review it's because you want help in deciding to buy it or not. Well all I can say is it's worth it.
B00005RYLE|5.0|You may need a strong stomach like me to see this if you are not used to watching stuff like Evil Dead. I don't mind it, and it is WITHOUT A DOUBT, THE GORIEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN {So far so good}.
B000002UJQ|5.0|The most interesting thing about this album is the huge number of great songs. OK computer is one of the most brilliant collection of melodies since the outset of the recording era.
B0002234LS|5.0|I wasn't sure what this meant at first, but now it made sense to me at the end. You just really have to pay attention to the whole movie and finally, you'll figure it out. Mort Rainey is an author and one day a guy named John Shooter comes to his house and claims that Mort \\"stole his story\\". He keeps appearing and asking for the same thing and Mort knows, but he won't change the ending. Soon, everything starts getting worse. Many people think this is creepy, but I don't really think so. It sort of LOOKS creepy, but the entire story is stupendous until the end. Stephen King must've thought hard about this. It kind of reminds me of the plot of Dreamcatcher. You might not think it makes sense at the beginning, but you will if you've never seen this. Secret Window looks as though it's something to hesitate and stay away from, but it's not. It's a great story to check out in another Stephen King movie that {I don't think he directed, but probably wrote}.
B00006V9A0|3.0|Yeah, I'll admit it straight away -- I'm a diehard Nirvana fan. So of course the Greatest Hits (and that's what this is, even if it's not the official title) was essential for me. And admittedly, this album features some of the best of the best songs they have to offer -- \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\\" \\"Lithium,\\" hell they were even kind enough to include \\"All Apologies,\\" which while it wasn't released as a single, is considered by most to be one of their best songs.  <br /> <br />But really, this CD is an extremely shallow overview of Nirvana. Make no mistake -- this CD is a \\"Greatest Hits,\\" not a \\"Best Of,\\" and there is a difference. The first problem is that there is only one song off of \\"Bleach,\\" the wonderful \\"About A Girl.\\" What about \\"Blew\\" or \\"Love Buzz\\"? Also, I have a serious problem with the snubbing of \\"Polly,\\" generally recognized as one of the most beautiful and meaningful of their songs. Next, there is no question that \\"Dive\\" or \\"Aneurysm\\" should be in the place of \\"Been A Son\\" off of \\"Incesticide.\\" Finally, if they were going to include a cover from the \\"Unplugged\\" session, it should have been \\"Where Did You Sleep Last Night?\\", a beautiful song that Kurt sang in a memorable and haunting way and is frankly better than the rendition of \\"The Man Who Sold the World.\\" In fact, the inclusion of MWSTW completely threw me off at first. I don't understand at all why that was included. <br /> <br />However . . . there is a previously unreleased song here called \\"You Know You're Right,\\" and that one song makes the CD worth buying if you're a fairly hardcore Nirvana fan. It's one of their best songs, utilizing their trademark (though ripped off from the Pixies) soft-verse-loud-chorus format in an anguished-sounding way that absolutely exhilarates the listener. It's a truly great song, and worth the CD. I wouldn't recommend the CD to a first-time Nirvana listener; I would suggest \\"Nevermind\\" and \\"In Utero\\" first because they give a much better picture of what Nirvanawas about. Then buy \\"Nirvana.\\" Thing is, if you're more of a casual fan, you can download \\"You Know You're Right\\" and put it on a much better mix than this. <br /> <br />Come to think of it, I wish that's what I had done.
0790744295|5.0|I haven't seen Creepshow 2, nor know what it is about, but I enjoy  and have the 1'st one. I was shocked that Mr. King is in it HIMSELF. He finds a meteor in his yard and it makes everything grow. It is one of my favorite parts with \\"Something to tide you over\\" the end of that skit was freaky. You will just have to watch it and find it out yourself. Not only do I love horror movies, but this is a TRUE CLASSIC with Children Of The Corn.{John Franklin was perfect in that}. My favorites in this movie are:<br /><br />THE LONESOME DEATH OF JORDY VERILL 5/5<br /><br />THE CRATE 4/5 {VERY CREEPY}<br /><br />SOMETHING TO TIDE YOU OVER 4/5
006016848X|2.0|I have studied and taught interpersonal communication skills professionally for over 35 years - partly with over 1,000 therapy clients since 1981. John Gray has done a service to the public in raising their interest and awareness in effective communication and more satisfying relationships. However, he omits some essential points that greatly diminish the practical usefulness of this book:<br /><br />1) The profound influence of six psychological wounds on how we all think, feel, and communicate. Most people are unconsciously affected by two to six \\"false-self wounds\\" which will defeat the logic that Gray advocates, and often block the best efforts to follow his advice. The second-most pervasive of these wounds is excessive shame and guilt;<br /><br />2) This book doesn't explain process awareness, metatalk, empathic listening (thanks to Steven Covey), and \\"E(motion)-levels\\" which are essential for effective problem-solving;<br /><br />3) This book doesn't emphasize human primary needs, or learning to \\"dig-down\\" undeneath surface needs to idenify the primary needs. That dooms unaware readers to focus fruitlessly on surface needs;<br /><br />4) The author omits the reality of \\"R(espect)-messages\\" which inexorably shape the effectiveness of every non-verbal and verbal communiication sequence between any two people - partly because of false-self wounds;<br /><br />5) Gray doesn't describe how *inner* conflicts affect interpersonal conflicts, and what to do about that;<br /><br />There are other omissions, but these in particular prevent this book from being all that it could be. Because typical readers don't know what they don't know about communication basics, they will not intuit these omissions. Nonetheless, the book will raise average readers' awareness.<br /><br />For more perspective, se this free course on effective coommunication: [...]<br /><br />The text for this courzse is [[ASIN:1450088376 Satisfactions]]
6302293553|5.0|\\"I THINK I'LL GO FOR A WALK!\\" This is as silly as And Now For Something Completely Different.Very good \\"knight\\" movie. It starts out with King Arthur and Patsy traveling through the land of England seeking out other knights that will join him at the Round Table and it goes on with him being successful with some of them such as Sir Lancelot and Sir Bedevere, Sir Robin the-not-so-brave-as-Sir Lancelot, and Sir Galahad. The end is sort of surprising. The killer rabbit is cool, too. That's later in the movie. This movie is worth being enjoyable. You will agree too. You will enjoy it yourself the whole entire time.
B00008EY65|3.0|My wife and I both enjoyed watching \\"Hellboy\\" on DVD, even though it was confusing in places and went on a bit too long.  Ron Perlman does a good job making Hellboy an interesting, even sympathetic, character, but there are too many balls in the air most of the time. The attempt to tie in every baddie of the 20th century, from Rasputin to the Nazis, seems forced.... and who built the huge, elaborate, gear-filled labyrinth under the mausoleum?  Lots of unanswered questions of this type. But if you're willing to go along for the ride, it's entertaining enough.  (We got an extra kick out of hearing David Hyde Pierce as the voice of Abe Sapiens!)
B00005NB8K|4.0|This was an excellent movie if you want to learn about how the Doors got their start and became famous.  It was kind of shocking how much Jim Morrison changed throughout the movie.  It also showed how much he loved and cared for his girlfriend.  You see the Doors working in the studio and them playing in concert.  You will be surprised what some of the stuff that Jim did on stage, he screamed at the croud and said some bad stuff.  But overall I would say that it was a great movie and strongly recommend it to fans of the Doors and even people who are not fans of them.  It made me like them more because it gives you a chance to actually really listen to the music.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|I didn't see this movie in the theaters. Well, I am glad I didn't. Renting a DVD and watching it at home was probably the best way to see this movie. First of all, the DVD comes with two versions of the movie: a Director's Cut and a theatrical version. You need to see both. Second of all, it is good to see this movie at least a second time, because there are scenes in the movie you could enjoy watching the second time if you already know the outcome. If you have a DVD collection at home, this is an excellent peice to have.  <br /> <br />This is a great movie that definitely stands out. In today's action/violence/thriller dominated market this movie can actually give some food for thought. It is a brain-tickling film that is not for dumb and blood-thirsty audience.
B00005JNEI|3.0|The film lacks any sense of visual style or sophistication. <br />It bludgens the viewer with the simplistic viewpoint of the <br />film maker. <br /> <br />Too much time spent on whiney crying people, no time spent <br />at all showing the WTC falling, but the target audience enjoys wearing <br />the hair shirt, and has opted out of independent thought. <br /> <br />For real quality propaganda, Triumph of the Will is the  <br />gold standard against which all propaganda movies must <br />be judged, and 9/11 falls sadly short.
B00003CXB2|5.0|Lawrence of Arabia is one of the finest films ever made.  It lacks a happy ending, but it is one of the most beautiful, sweeping, romantic, thought-provoking, historically accurate, and realistic epics ever made.  If you can believe Lawrence was Peter O'Toole's first film, and that he was nominated for a Best Actor Oscar and DIDN'T GET IT - then you will have an idea of the sad feeling you have at the end. David Lean directed this film, five years after he directed the Bridge on the River Kwai.  Lawrence's cinematography and music are sublime.  There are many, many very good actors in minor roles.<br /><br />The film tells the true story of T.E. Lawrence, a British officer who was stationed in the Middle East during WWI.  Lawrence donned sheik's robes and led fractious nomadic tribes in a successful revolt against the Turks.  The unusual army destroyed Turkish rail lines and drove them out of their stronghold in Akaba, paving the way for the British army to come in.<br /><br />Lawrence was enchanted by the harsh simplicity of the desert, and had a genuine love and respect for the desert tribes.  He wanted the desert to belong to the Arabs, but constant warring among tribes and imperialist intervention crushed his dream.  He returned to England disillusioned and bitter.  For more information, Lawrence's book \\"Seven Pillars of Wisdom,\\" published in 1922.  Seven Pillars details his experiences in the desert with the nomadic warriors, and the revolt.  David Lean, the film's director, based the film almost entirely on this book.<br /><br />In the film, O'Toole plays the strange and unique Lawrence perfectly.  O'Toole's intense blue, searching eyes, his handsomeness and his golden hair lend to create and immortalize the mythic figure of this warrior-poet.  One thing you know right away is that they broke the mold when they made Lawrence.  O'Toole seems lost in the British military compound, and comes alive in the punishing environment of the desert.  His brave and courageous acts leads a sheik to become his friends.  Omar Sharif plays Ali. His tribe follows Lawrence through \\"the sun's anvil\\" on a risky mission to add a band of brigands to their army.  The leader of the tribe of brigands, Auda, is played by Anthony Quinn.<br /><br />The scenes up until Lawrence's capture and abuse by Turks are glorious and inspiring.  El Aurents, as the nomads call him, is the Braveheart of the Desert.  But as in Braveheart, as in war, things cannot always end as they begin.  Herein lies the heartache of war.  A scene where Lawrence loses his mind and takes it out on bedraggled injured Turks is incredibly painful to watch, considering all that has come before.<br /><br />Sharif is so passionate, and an incredible actor.  He is Lawrence's sole support and it is painful to watch his grief as his friend slips into depression and madness.  Like O'Toole, he too had an Oscar snatched out of his hand.ik to become his friends.  Omar Sharif plays Ali.

B000001Y42|5.0|This is Limp Bizkit's first album, and it is also thier best. They sold out with 'Significant Other', so this is the only album that showcases the real Bizkit. This was also made back before Fred Durst got a huge ego. The most surprising thing about this album is that the lyrics are acutally not that bad. The guitars and bass are perfect along with the scratching. The only downpoint to 'Three Dollar Bill Y'all' is that the production is terrible, but it still a very good album. Sadly, however, it is their only good album.
B000063COX|5.0|Iron Maiden has had a truly amazing career for a heavy metal band.  Despite some line-up changes through the years, including lead singers, the core of the group has remained stable.  Bruce Dickenson coming back to the band as lead singer recently has strengthened the band simply because he has a voice and ability to really carry a heavy metal band.  Iron Maiden has been making great music for over 20 years now.  I've only seen them live twice and that was in the 1980's.  They put a fabulous show.  And Eddie is a great mascot. <br /> <br />This, their debut album released in 1980, remains one of their best.  Unlike many heavy metal bands at the time, who leaned toward very long songs with extended solos, this album has typically shorter hard driving songs with very clever lyrics.  It featured Paul Di'Anno as the lead singer, who I thought was very good in the few albums he is on. <br /> <br />I have three favorite songs on this CD that I would give a star to but I like the entire collection of work, which gives it a big thumbs up.  Hardcore Maiden fans will be surprised that Charlotte the Harlot and Iron Maiden didn't get a star because they are both very popular songs.  I like them both but they don't inch their way into a star category for me. <br /> <br />I rate this CD a solid three stars: <br /> <br />Running Free * <br />Phantom of the Opera * <br />Sanctuary * <br /> <br />----------------------------------------------------------------- <br />Ratings:  CDs are rated simply by how many good songs are on the album.  Great songs get two stars, and good songs get one star.  Songs that get no stars are those that I might like but not enough to give it a star  or ones I find boring or actively dislike.  CDs are not penalized for songs that I don't like because they are easy enough to skip over.  There is no maximum number of stars a CD can get, but of course the more stars it gets, the better the CD. <br /> <br />As with all reviews, these are my subjective opinions on the album.   <br />
B00005JLEU|1.0|This movie is (apart from some good animation) rotten, very creepy, and will mess with your mind, like it has with mine and a person that also has seen it with me. I strongly suggest that if you like horror storys you might just stomach this otherwise stay away from it! It was made for Japan and thats where it should have stayed!<br /><br />(If you love animation so much that you have to see this film then watch it with the lights on or curtains open and take a break from waching this film for 5 miniutes every 15 minutes and sit outside if you can, if the film is to much for you from a certain point then dont watch any more because the film becomes worse and worse.)

Given that I consider Iron Maiden to be one of the best heavy metal bands ever, this is an absolute must have for any Iron Maiden fan.  It has the best songs from Iron Maiden's first five albums and the live versions of 2 Minutes to Midnight, The Number of the Beast, Hallowed be Thy Name, Children of the Damned, and Phantom of the Opera are particularly excellent. <br />
B0001UL7RY|4.0|Another twelve superb songs by Canada's best new talent although not in the same masterpiece league as Let Go, Under My Skin is still a must have for anyone's collection.  I always wait a month or so before reviewing a newly acquired album as you tend to listen to and like most albums more when they first come out which would reflect in your review if you wrote it straight away.  I still listen to Under My Skin but to be honest I do listen to her first album Let Go a lot more. Still this a great collection and breath of fresh air when compared to most attractive young female singers who cannot write their own songs and rely more on image and tabloid marketing to sell their albums than raw talent. Who cares if Avril is really a punk or skater? I buy CDs for the music not the artist's image and this is another great album with no fillers.

In this album Iron Maiden goes to longer storytelling tracks than their previous albums, and with good results.     Where Eagles Dare, Revelations, and The Trooper are my favorite tracks.  This is another one of those albums where are all the songs are pretty good and you'll find yourself listening to the entire CD without skipping tracks.    This is my second favorite Iron Maiden album next to The Number of the Beast.    I rate this CD an impressive 5 stars.

B000059XYL|2.0|Now, this is my mind on this movie. Too much focusing on women dancing on bars and not on story and characters, hence this is a boring movie, but the women are good, but this movie is boring. Now see you wouldnt get me on a table and dance and take it off, nope, not my thing. John Goodman as Piper Perabo's father is a treat though. This is Tyra Bank's first big movie breakout and see does it nice. As far as i'm concerned the thought of Coyote Ugly 2 would be more of the same, except that Piper Perabo, not Maria Bello trains the new recruit and it would be more of the same but new moves, but more of the same. Also starring Adam Garcia.
6305075352|5.0|\\"Mississippi Burning\\" is one of the best and most powerful films released in 1998, earning seven Oscar nominations including Best Picture.  It stars Gene Hackman and Willam Dafoe.  This provacative true story explores a Mississippi town that suffers terrorism from the Ku Klux Klan and other citizens.  As two FBI  agents investigate the disappearance of three Civil Rights activists, tensions between most of the town and they turn life threatening.  Even the town police system and the sheriff try to stop the FBI agents.  This film entails deeply how racism affects a nation.  Its strong intensity has the impact to force a reality check to many audiences. <br /> <br />Its brilliant plot wonderfully presents itself throughout the film.  Its strong emotion wonderfully honors those victims as it should.  Some may consider this piece an educational film.  Its shock value hits audiences in the level it should.  The research of the events and racism itself is always present, including conservative town surroundings that blend with the 1964 styles.  The great performances from Hackman, Dafoe, and Frances McDormand capitalize the plot's powerful effect.  Without them, this film wouldn't have the same meaningful theme.   <br /> <br />Such tremendous film quality makes \\"Mississippi Burning\\" a guaranteed audience pleaser.  After many years, its theme never loses its meaning regardless number of viewings.  This will surely become a film classic in the next following years.
6300163423|3.0|Mickey \\"Mouse\\" Rourke (Once Upon A Time In Mexico, The Rainmaker), thats what I like to call him, plays a hired detective on the trail for some guy and who hired him you asked, well of course it was Count Robert DeNiro (upcoming Shark Tale, Meet The Parents), or so he looked like a vampire with those long nails. Rouke goes on a wild goose chase throughout the whole movie trying to find this guy, running into chickens now and again. He also records his events on a little old fashioned voice recorder. But things stir fry up as Rourke's mind takes a hault and it gets twisted around as he finds out the surprising truth. The movie is slowly paced and Rourke and DeNiro do very excellent jobs but it had some things about it that weighed it down abit. The chickens did an excellent job as well, especially the one Lisa Bonet (Enemy Of The State, High Fidelity) killed in that ritualistic dance. Chickens are superb actors and noone notices that. The last like 20 minutes are the best where Rourke finds out the grisly truth. That controversial sex scene with Rourke wasnt that controversial, it was just like \\"ok, theres blood and images, so what?\\" Also starring a thin Pruitt Taylor Vince (Identity, Mississippi Burning) and Charlotte Rampling (Swimming Pool).  <br /> <br />Best Line <br />Rourke- \\" I have a thing about chickens.\\"
0802130208|5.0|This is a work of genius. At some level Confederacy of Dunces is a comedy, but its so unbelievably creative and so well written that it goes well beyond that. A great book, timeless, in the tradition of Cervantes, clearly something that will be read for a long, long time. <br /> <br />The cohesiveness of the work makes it difficult to highlight partcular elements that stood out. There are impassioned explorations of character throughout - the central protaganist is at the same time too absurd to be real, and too completely concieved to be fiction. And there is a clockwork symmetry to the plot that comes together seamlessly and often hilarously at unexpected points. But perhaps the most striking thing I was left with was an affection for Igancious, the central character of the book. He's paranoid, manipulative, self-centered, ugly and unpleasant to all, and at the same time a completely sympathetic character. I'm not sure what magic Toole used to pull this off, but it is without question, beautifully done. <br /> <br /> <br />There's a lot made of this being a New Orleans book, but the geography of the city seemed entirely secondary to the immediate environments it portrays - the shabby homes, the seedy bars, the dank bus station bathrooms, were much more real to me than the descriptions of the French Quarter. <br /> <br />There were a few rough patches in the last few chapters, where the dialogue becomes a little disjointed. It seemed a bit less cleanly edited than the rest of the book. It left the feeling for me that maybe Toole wasn't fully finished with it, that maybe he had a tiny edit or two left undone. But the book comes back into its own full force at the dramatic crescendo, where a series of tiny one-paragraph chapters spell out the unfolding of the intertwined fates of its characters. <br /> <br />There is an internal, almost symphonic logic to this work, with themes appearing and reappearing in different scenarios, in different characters throughout. In all ways masterfully done, a classic. <br />
B0000E6I1J|4.0|I feel obligated to respond to a prior review - the Shankars are two of the great musicians in the world. Maybe the \\"average\\" person (whatever that means) doesn't care for Indian music, but as fans of George Harrison I would hope that you would emulate his example of an open mind and try to find what is so beautiful in this music. <br /> <br />As my brother said when watching the DVD, \\"Tom Petty is going to crawl back into his coffin after the show.\\" He sounds a bit out of sorts. Also, Ringo's numbers are not very good. But Eric Clapton sings and plays his heart out, Paul is wonderful, and so are George's songs. The uke tune at the end, \\"I'll See You In My Dreams\\" is gorgeous. <br /> <br />God bless Eric Clapton for doing this.
B00000J7J4|3.0|'Supernatural' defines everything that is Carlos Santana, spirituality, peace, and mysticism. As expected, this album contains Santana's gifted latin-tinged guitarwork combined with a contemporary easy-listening feel, almost at a New Agey/jazzlike pace. The overall album dabbles in everything from strings, horns, electronic beats, bluesy solos, and guest vocalists, but if there's anything that's unmistakable, it's the breathing penetrating notes of the guitar shaman himself. The sound is that of latin wind-swept waves and the joy of living, a time of reflection, a time of introspection, a time of celebration. 'Supernatural' is not only a celebration of a guitar legend, but also a celebration of music...a celebration of life.
B00005JMUA|5.0|While waiting for the inevitable ultimate edition of this title together with Part I, in some kind of souped up \\"Bill Saga,\\" this DVD transfer does just fine.  It's worth it just to see the expressions of doubt, fear, pain and triumph cross Uma Thurman's face.  The deleted scene is also worth th cost of the DVD, so there you go, it's the kind of extra I wasn't expecting with this apparent time-serving placeholder, so good for QT.  Mexican-American actors may protest QT's use of the Anglo (former) heart throb Michael Parks to play the Mexican capo, but Parks delivers a performance that outdoes his playing of a very different role in KILL BILL VOL 1.  I showed this DVD to three ftiends who had never seen part I, and none of them complained that they couldn't understand it.  It is number one, a simple story when stripped of its excrescences, and number two, hypnotic from the first majestic downbeat on the soundtrack.<br /><br />The DVD looks and sounds great all the way through to the improbable and happy ending.  Of course, we have a feeling there will be trouble ahead when the little daughter of Vivica Fox grows up to brandish a weapon raised in vengeance.  Those of you who have read Cornell Woolrich's novels THE BRIDE WORE BLACK or THE BLACK ANGEL will have experienced this richness of story-telling before, but for the rest of us, KILL BILL is a novel idea, beautifully executed by a gang of pros.

1558908455|1.0|If you took Quentin Tarantino's name off this movie (you can leave his B-movie acting though) and Robert Rodriguez's name off, then every four- and five-star rating would disappear faster than George Clooney's chance of playing Batman again.  Someone might want to explain to the filmmakers the proper way a vampire movie should \\"suck.\\"<br /><br />And this ain't it.<br /><br />A night from dusk until dawn in a bordertown Mexican dive bar would be more enjoyable and entertaining than the hour and a half I sat through this movie.<br /><br />The plot is so thin and derivative and repetitious that the theory could be put forth that the only reason this movie was made was so Tarantino could have Salma Hayek's toes in his mouth.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|What can I say about this CD?  Needless to say, DeGraw has talent.  An amazing voice, sung with power that rips at your soul.  More than that, the lyrics are deep, thought-provoking, and interesting.  Not loaded with sexual references.....just a man singing his heart out.  I wish I could give it 100 stars.  I listen almost exclusively to just contemporary Christian music, but I had to buy this CD.  It is the first mainstream CD I have ever bought because it has incredible depth with amazing instrumental accompaniment.  Just incredible.  If you do not buy this CD, you are seriously missing out on a breathtaking piece of work.

B0000214F0|2.0|Lesser ecstasy, the way of all flesh, this is Caligula. Perverse, almost religious. Pretentious production overblowing the proportions of its intent, the result could have been far more meritorious and grandiose. Gore Vidal, Bob Guccione, and Tinto Brass, gathered for the ultimate erotic film ever shown in common Theaters, the result as a cinematographic triumph, not happening, but it is still shocking. The only real statement of Caligula is to have dared shown the pre-Christian Roman Empire in its entire decadent life of rotten flesh, unlimited sex, clean, filthy, orgiastic parties of special magnificence, and cut-throat acts of bestial and deprave human willing, it is great and beautiful. <br />Caligula stands somewhere in the dominions of the erotic and the graphic of pornography. Tinto Brass narrates the lousy story of Emperor Gaius Germanicus Caesar, better know as Caligula, a script by Oscar Winner writer Gore Vidal, whose intentions to tell the fall from sanity and common sense into the Necromancies of power and the corruption of its touch, corrupted by the crown and its seasons, where frustrated by Director Tinto Brass, this project was to much for him, lacking the necessary vision and talent for an accurate direction, the other layer of bad sense was indeed its producer, Bob Guccione, at least Guccione had the daring eye to show the explicit even more explicit, but also lacking the talent for a better understanding of the story, it was about sex for him since the beginning. About the Historic Caligula, the main ancient reference to the megalomaniac character (besides the vague anecdotal writings), is: Suet. Gaius; Dio 59; Philo In Flaccum and Legatio ad Gaium; Jos. AJ 19.1-211. Tacitus's account of the reign is lost. However, he makes occasional references to Gaius in the extant portions of his works, as does Seneca. The later sources inherited a tradition about Gaius that can be shown to be biased and exaggerated. Besides these literary sources, inscriptions and coins also offer some information. So you can't be factually loyal to the Historic truth, and that gives you license to do pretty much anything you want, in this matter, the film can't be criticized concerning the story of its protagonist. Tinto Brass direction is un-personal and cold, a succession of images that moves schematically towards a much predictable ending. The first 30 minutes are composed in an inappropriate Theater style, which is un-intentionally enhanced by the Theatrical production design of the settings, it seems that Tinto Brass caught a better sense of pace and composition after shooting those scenes, and some how manage a more dynamic narration, even so, without any real soul. Bob Guccione shoot additional material to be added in the sex scenes, but the mediocre editing felt short inserting those scenes in a more imperceptible way.  <br />Over the years I heard a lot of stories about the graphic and out daring ways of Caligula's sex scenes, so I expected to see real hard core images, stories that went from vast orgies, to a woman having sex with a horse, a man having intercourse with a duck, and a very long etc of perversities. So the movie didn't really shock me as I expected. Of course, if you are a very conservative or repressed person, the film will not only shock you, it will insult your moral values, Pastors, loyal Christians, and of course, Republicans, will also be severely insulted by the sex scenes, any way, the movie comes anticipated with an infamous fame, you can't make no mistakes, if you buy or rent it, don't blame the film for its controversial content, blame your self for being naive. <br />Caligula's sex content is way out dare from any previous movie that calls it self an erotic film, the difference is that Caligula does have pornographic inserts on it (plain shots of both sex's genitalia, oral sex, copulations, masturbation, etc). But the film can't be categorized as a porn flick. Pornographic movies intention is to show continuous explicit sex scenes without any real plot, always pushing for as many sex scenes as possible, Caligula doesn't have this, even though the story is poor, the sex is very well inserted in the life of the Roman Empire, expanding its plot with its main characters concerning the madness and greed for power, there is not a continuous pushing for exposure of hard core sex all over the film (at least not in the way of porn flicks), here lies the charm of the film, the sex taken in the social environment of the Roman Empire is an splendid depict of the period, every shot of sex intercourse is for free, but to be honest, I wouldn't have it any other way.  <br />The performances of the Cast are both poor and flat. Malcolm McDowell wasn't enough for the role, his malignant looks felt short, an opportunity much dismissed. The Great Peter O'toole is barely O.K. but without any resembles to his masterful and classical performances. Helen Mirren and John Gielgud are completely wasted, the rest aren't really actors to be considered so.  <br />The Woman are just beautiful, Teresa Ann Savoy (Julia Drusilla), Helen Mirren (in her younger years), as Caesonia, the Penthouse Pets are breathtaking, a real feast for the eye. <br />The photography is awful, boring colors and easy lighting, a mayor waste if you take into consideration the significant budget of the film. A good score does some goods for the film (including music by Sergei Prokofiev). Bad costume design and pretentious setting design surely captures the mood of the Roman Empire, but a fake Roman Empire. Caligula was released in 1980, at the very end of the 70's sex freedom, and just before Ronald Regan's repressed republican policies of censorship. Right now Caligula could not be shown in common Theaters in the U.S.A in its un-rated version. If it where a high pack action thriller full of blood, there will be no problem at all. <br />The DVD is O.K., the transferring can't be called bad, but a better work could have been attained, the 5.1 Dolby Digital is good, but with a poor distribution of the sounds. The Making Of Documentary is excellent and very complete (also un-rated). <br />So, even with all the bad elements in it, Caligula is brave and highly entertaining, and Cinema always needs brave and different projects to sustain it self. You can call it a piece of sh..., or a masterpiece, it doesn't matter, Caligula, Fellini Satyricon (oviously emulated by the producers of Caligula), and Gladiator are the only Roman films I'll see during Holy Weekend. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JMXX|3.0|Through breathtaking scenery and a somewhat developed plot, this movie was better than I expected.
B0001Z52RU|1.0|I am writing this review solely as a act of benevolence for those of you who have not yet seen this completely moronic pile.  I wasted two hours of my life watching this DVD last night and I wish that I could get it back.  So, for your sake, I advise you to stay away from this one.  It has a promising premise, I know.  But it is so poorly written that you feel taken advantage of because it undermines your intelligence.  They thought that by putting in every dark subject matter they could think of, it might pass as artsy reality fare, but it fails miserably.  You can see through their effort, just as you can see through the many plot holes abound.  Not even entertaining - do something else with your time, while you still can. Peace.
B0001MDP3G|2.0|Not sure what the hype was about it was thoroughly lacking in many respects.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|This film's director's cut ending is the appropriate ending.  The director's cut is a very well put together jigsaw puzzle who'se pieces all come together in the last few minutes of the film.  The other ending is all Hollywood, and takes a profound movie into the profane.
B00008EY65|1.0|If I was 12 yeas old I might have liked it but....
B0002IU988|5.0|This isn't Creed.  This is...ALTERBRIDGE. Make no mistake. This is in your face rock.  Period.  Myles Kennedy is what has been missing in Rock.  Mark Tremonti is going to blow you away with his intricate guitar shredding. He gets to showcase more talent on this record then you ever got to see with Creed.  The record rocks.....hard.  I personally dig the heavier tunes: \\"One Day Remains,\\" \\"Metalingus,\\" and \\"Watch Your Words.\\" However, songs like \\"In Loving Memory\\" will stay with you. Almost haunt you.  It is a inspiring and amazing song.  Do yourself a favor and pick up this amazingly fresh sound to rock.  YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT.  Enjoy!
B00005JLEX|5.0|After years of waiting impatiently I am very pleasantly surprised to finally see that it will be out on DVD.  Some of the best laughs on TV are on these disks.
1594200106|5.0|This book is absolutely stunning.  At first I was put off by the sheer length of it all; but the writer is so engaging and you cannot help but feel enormously for the characters-whether its disgust at the books villan, Fumero, or love and hope for the books protagonist, Julian. I could not commend this book more highly.
B00005JMUA|2.0|I was very much looking forward to Kill Bill vol. 2.  I thought Vol. 1 was OK--it was very stylishly done, and the fight scenes were excellent.  But it lacked that snappy Tarantino dialogue, and therefore, I found it somewhat disappointing.  I had heard there was more talking in Vol. 2, so I thought we would finally get some vintage Tarantino filmmaking.  WRONG!  The dialogue--forgettable.  The fight scenes--horrible.  Especially the one where the Bride takes on Pei Mei.  The characters played by Darryl Hannah and Michael Madsen aren't nearly as compelling as that played by Lucy Liu.  She was a much more formidable adversary, and it was fun watching Uma Thurman take her on.  And finally at the end, when it is down to Bill and the Bride, you just want to scream, \\"That's it?!?!\\" when it is all over and Bill finally is dead.  In retrospect, the end was fitting I suppose, but I still felt cheated by the whole experience.  I knew that splitting it up into 2 movies was a ploy to make more money, but after seeing the whole thing, it is obvious why they wanted to do this.  The first one is lacking because it is not the complete story, but it was much better done than the second.  Thank goodness I didn't waste money to see this in the theater.  Frankly, I expected much better from Tarantino. I fear that he used up all his talent in Pulp Fiction, and that it will be all downhill from there.
B00000JCOV|4.0|Hmmm. This cd will always give me mixed feelings. Part of me loves it, part of me hates it and part of me hates to love it. That's the problem. Basically, the lyrics are trite and unoriginal no matter how you interpret them. The music is pretty explosive in some places but can seem like one long infernal racket if you are not in the \\"mood\\" for it. The \\"mood\\" for this cd by the way, is extremely angry, violent, and hateful and you need to feel like everyone and everything should just die to really relate to it. Which is cool for me since I hate the world. So if you have to take or have taken some serious sh*t in your life then buy this cd and get some anger out. Happy, fulfilled, peaceful people will get nothing out of it and spend their time wondering why the hell other people do. This is probably music to listen too if you feel like killing someone. If you want music to kill yourself to however then buy korn, the self tiled album or Korns'Issues. That will really make you want to carve up your arm.
038572179X|4.0|The rating is for the writing, rather than the storyline or the characters. <br /> <br />McEwan is a wordsmith beyond description with the ability to evoke an image, a time and a place that is difficult to match.  If you wondered if 'war is hell' the period where Robbie is trying to get back to his beloved Cec will convince you that the tepid news reports we've gotten as well as most war oriented novels barely scratch the surface.  You are literally in the trenches, eating dirt and trying to take one more step. <br /> <br />On the downside as someone just mentioned, the lead character Briony is annoying, weak and hard to identify with from start to finish  While Cousin Lola is castigated for her weakness, she is clearly identified as an unsympathetic character from the start. How she and the oh so precocious Briony end up in cahoots to destroy both Robbie and Cec is hard to reconcile.  Neither of them really seem to develop into anything admirable whereas Cec who starts out as an aimless, wealthy slob develops into a woman of character and substance. <br /> <br />The ending is nicely done with the final twist unexpected and effective.
B00000099Y|5.0|No, Tool is not the second coming of jesus and definitely not the anti-christ either. Tool is 4 guys who have set the stage for modern music. The Zeppelin of our era. You can't compare legends to soon to be legends, it's just not possible. But not only does Tool play exceptional music, but they also raised the standard of music today. Not only that, but implemented ideas that have never been introduced to popular music. Aenima is a good entry CD to a newcomer of Tool. If it bores you, then you're not listening enough. Songs that latch on to you right away soon wear away, but I know from personal experience that every song on this CD lives within me for eternity and will never 'bore' me, as I always find something new everytime I listen. Also, if you are looking for another Dream Theater or Syphony X, don't bother. Tool doesn't waste time stuffing complexes odd time signatures and guitar solos into their songs. They choose to send their message in a more simpler, but impressive fashion.
B0000640S2|5.0|Okay I must say, I for one did not care for the First Rambo very much, It was a good film and all but still, It left me kinda sleeping. Now on to the sequel, WOW! I have almsot never been so impressed with a movies sequel, so much more action and entertainment! I love how it also brings the realism and tragedy of war into the movie.
B000000OAN|5.0|A Night At The Opera(Hollywood)(1975). Queen's Fourth Album.<br /><br />After Queen's previous three albums('Queen', 'Queen II', 'Sheer Heart Attack'), which failed to produce hardly any commercial success, their label pressured them to break through or they were going to drop them. While Queen experimented with a mixture of Hard Rock and Heavy Metal, all while adding in a Progressive touch to it, Queen didn't adapt the style everyone has known and loved over the years until 'A Night At The Opera'. While still retaining their Progressive Rock/Metal approach, Queen started using an intentionally pompous and overblown approach, making their music operatic and humorous, and adding in appealing Pop sensibilities. Apparently, Queen's purposely overblown and humorous approach to good-old Hard Rock hit off with the public, as 'A Night At The Opera' climbed the American Charts to #4, easily staying their for a long time with the #6 position of \\"The Bohemian Rhapsody\\" and the Rock Radio hit \\"You're My Best Friend\\".'A Night At The Opera' gave Queen the success they craved so much, and within the year, the album sold over a million copies, and over time has sold over 5 million, establishing it as one of their biggest successes, and etching their legend in Rock 'N Roll forever.<br /><br />As for the music, read on to find out what I thought of it!<br /><br />Track Ratings-<br /><br />Death On Two Legs(Dedicated To.....- 'A Night At The Opera' begins magnificently, as Queen molds a Gothic influenced Heavy Metal song about Vampires, entitled \\"Death On Two Legs\\". Mercury's sneering and intentionally sarcastic vocals fit perfectly with May's dark guitar melody.<br /><br />Lazing On A Sunday Afternoon- Remember Big Band and Swing? Apparently Queen does, and on \\"Lazing On A Sunday Afternoon\\", Queen has a humorous take-off of Swing, featuring Mercury's hilarious distorted vocals. Funny!<br /><br />I'm In Love With My Car- Queen hits back with \\"I'm In Love With My Car\\", a pulsing, melodic Hard Rock stunner, featuring angry vocals from Mercury, which is surprising with the cheesy subject! May throws out some killer riffs, and it's no surprise Queen delivers an excellent song here!<br /><br />You're My Best Friend- Queen's keyboard driven Pop/Rock made \\"You're My Best Friend\\" a huge hit, not to mention Mercury's operatic and soothing vocals. The backing vocals and keyboards really take this song to new heights, and \\"You're My Best Friend\\" is a short but sweet gem!<br /><br />'39- Can you imagine Queen doing Country? Neither could I! Although, after listening to \\"'39\\", I can safely say their blend of Country and Rock with Mercury's hauntingly beautiful vocals works. Typically I would slam Country Ballads, but Mercury truly makes this song excellent. Great bassline!<br /><br />Sweet Lady- \\"Sweet Lady\\" is 'A Night At The Opera's underrated masterpiece, a scathing look at women's mistreatment of their husband. Classic Hard Rock/Heavy Metal never sounded better, and Daltrey's sarcastic vocals with May's metallic assault on the ears makes \\"Sweet Lady\\" a great song! You think May's overrated? Listen to this song my friend, and his solo that's over a minute! I think you'll change your mind!<br /><br />Seaside Rendezvous- Once again, Queen experiments with Big Band and Swing, with Mercury's humorous vocals and the odd Polka instrumentation, \\"Seaside Rendezvous\\" makes for an overblown, hilarious song you can't help but like!<br /><br />The Prophet's Song- Much like Crimson King, Queen uses a Medieval Melody mixed with Progressive Metal to create an original, brilliant epic. Mercury and the backup vocalists are truly brilliant here, and their Medieval vocals and lyrics work well behind May's creative guitar harmonies. \\"The Prophet Song\\" also contains an ocappela performance by Mercury(no instruments), but soon returns to full-fledged Classic Hard Rock. Brilliant Progressive Rock, and possibly the album's masterpiece!<br /><br />Love of My Life- A Piano drivenballad, \\"Love of My Life\\" finds Mercury's brooding and operatic vocals molding a touching and moving song.<br /><br />Good Company- An odd mixture of Swing and Folk, \\"Good Company\\"'s creative and original melody, not to mention Mercury's humorous vocals make this song a winner!<br /><br />Bohemian Rhapsody- Although \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" charted in 1976, it never reached its peak position of #2 until 1992 after the release of 'Wayne's World', which featured the song in the most memorable scene of the movie. Featuring over 150 vocal and instrumental overdubs, \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" starts off as a Keyboard heavy melodic rocker, yet by the song's end, Mercury and Queen spit out some of the albums heaviest material. Overblown to the point of tedium, \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" is never the less a masterpiece, and one of Hard Rock's greatest songs, without a doubt!<br /><br />God Save The Queen- Brian May's take on Britain's National Anthem shows he can rip on the guitar quite well.<br /><br />The 1991 remaster of 'A Night At The Opera' features two Bonus Remixes of \\"I'm In Love With My Car\\" and \\"You're My Best Friend\\", which, while excellent, aren't really different from the originals.<br /><br />Overall, 'A Night At The Opera' is Queen's swansong, a magnificent hybrid of Heavy Metal, Hard Rock, Classic Rock, and Opera, all the while keeping that overblown and humorous aspect that fans have come to love over the years. What more can I say? Mercury, May, and the rest of Queen dish out one of the best performances of their career, and it should be heard by everyone!<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO FANS OF PROG ROCK, CLASSIC ROCK, HARD ROCK, HEAVY METAL, AND QUEEN. OVERBLOWN AND POMPOUS? YES, BUT WHO EXACTLY CARES? NOT ME!<br /><br />Killer Kuts- \\"You're My Best Friend\\", \\"The Prophet's Song\\", \\"Death On Two Legs\\", and \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\".<br /><br />Also Recommended-<br /><br />Sheer Heart Attack- Queen<br />Bat Out Of Hell- Meatloaf<br />Machine Head- Deep Purple<br /><br />Thanks For Reading!moving song.    Good Company- An odd mixture of Swing and Folk, \\"Good Company\\"'s creative and original melody, not to mention Mercury's humorous vocals make this song a winner!

The 1991 remaster of 'A Night At The Opera' features two Bonus Remixes of \\"I'm In Love With My Car\\" and \\"You're My Best Friend\\", which, while excellent, aren't really different from the originals.

B0000TB01Y|5.0|Who would have thought that an amazingly detailed novel called \\"Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West\\" could make the most fascinating and spectacular show to hit Broadway in a very long time (excepting Sam Mendes' brilliant revival of Gypsy). Every song is beautifully written, and the pop score matches the well-written and 1939 Wizard of Oz spoofing book very well. Kristin Chenoweth (G(a)linda) is in fine form here, as the amazingly ditzy Good Witch of the North, while Idina Menzel is a very commanding, Elphaba, who grows up into the Wicked Witch of the West. Joel Grey brings life to the Wizard, the only part that wasn't written perfectly. \\"Wonderful\\" though one of the best on the CD doesn't seem to mix well with the rest. It's very Broadway sounding, while the rest is pop. Even so, he plays the character with such warmth, and is perfect in the part. All the songs on the CD are wonderful, and there's something very witty and perfect about the entire thing. Favorite songs include \\"Popular\\" \\"Wonderful\\" \\"Dancing Through Life\\" and \\"Defying Gravity\\" which has taken an official role as the song people identify the show with. Take my advice, buy the CD, you'll be listening to it for days afterwards.  <br /> <br />BOTTOM LINE- Wicked makes you want to dance through life
B00005JMAH|5.0|The third installment of the Harry Potter movies is an excellent change from the first two, under the direction of Chris Columbus. Not that taking a book and making it verbatim into a film is bad. Indeed, I enjoyed the first two films very much. <br /> <br />But in Cuaron's version, there are definitely stylistic differences between this movie and its predecessors, and between the book and the film. Like many other critics before myself have said, it felt more like a film than a staged reading of the book. Those that are sensitive to detail will notice the change in Hogwarts's grounds, and the order in which events took place. Granted, after both reading the entire series and watching the film, there were just a few things that I would have tweaked in the movie if given the chance. <br /> <br />But overall, this was a very impressive film, and I felt that the three young leads have grown a lot due to their work with Cuaron, who pushed them more into the method style of acting, I believe. I think that after this film, they will all be more effective actors. <br /> <br />I enjoyed the film very  much, and I look forward to purchasing it when it comes out! <br />
0451191153|4.0|An interesting book that comes close to championing the value of common sense,  but unfortunately veers into unresolvable philosophical issues.  That caring for oneself is absolutely crucial for human happiness is obviously true, but Rand goes too far in praise of this fact and in effect weakens her argument.  But I guess for an argument to be considered \\"philosophical\\" it has to worship idealogy over boring old reality. At least Rand had more common sense than the Buddhist reviewer.  He, as I once did, values idealogy over his own experience. One doesn't really face the \\"truth\\" that there is no self unless one is sitting around reading a book about it.  This philosophy pretends to embrace the transitoriness of life and thus paints itself as brave in the face of harsh realities, but in fact it is merely and intellectual fantasy. It pretends not to be intellectual but is really hyperintellectual: it places its own idealogy above the basic instincts, feelings, senses, and desires of humankind. I talk too much of this because I have experienced it, and I believe deeply that it is a sickness.  Sometimes religion can certainly be healthy, and I am sure there are plenty of positive aspects of buddhism, but any philosophy which tells you that caring for yourself is merely caring for an \\"illusion\\" and that valuing and cherishing your own desires and aspirations (assuming they are healthy, etc.) is a sin is essentially the cruelest form of masochism in a kind, gentle cloak.  Whatever you think it will do for you in terms of happiness and mental health, please rethink it.  It is an easy trap to fall in for idealistic people, and I speak from experience. Anyway, if anyone has any comments I'd like to hear them.
B0001US62I|4.0|When originally released in the late eighties, this movie fizzled out of theatres faster than Rourke fizzled out of Hollywood. Although Rourke only had himself to be blame for a ruined career, this film owes its lack of early success to..well..coming out too early. After all, nineties blockbusters such as Silence of Lambs and Seven seemed to have borrowed heavily from it. A dark dreary backdrop didn't appeal to the eighties masses, who were all about wearing neon colors, driving red Pontiac Fieros, and watching Top Gun on VHS. <br /> <br />Thank the Lord for DVD because now we can rediscover this little lost relic that never found an audience in the eighties. Everthing about this film emotes the creeps. From chicken blood to Robert Deniro biting into an egg as if it were a human heart, there's more than enough to freak a person out.  <br /> <br />DVD extras include interviews and commentary. Rourke's commentary is hilarious because he basically has nothing to say. He had so little to say, his commentary really amounts to nothing but a short interview.  <br /> <br />
B0000070QS|5.0|A masterpiece! And no less, belongs in every home and in every cd-collection - beautiful and moving ballads, some perfect compositions (Half in love, half in hate and Spanish steps could not have been better) - I personally find the last song on the album best, the cover of Ready To Go Home - as made for the voice of Harket - the opening with Kind Of Christmas Card is quite rememberable too I think - the best I've heard from Harket since East Of The Sun... with A-ha. Highly recommended for true music lovers.

6301954947|5.0|I was fortunate enough to find this movie on DVD, Widescreen, on the european market.  It cost some bucks, and the purchase of an all-region DVD player to be able to see it, but well worth it.  I never cease to be amazed how studios pay the big bucks to a few idiots who call themselves artists and allow them to butcher a beautiful production on the editing room.  I can only hope that the releasing studio will someday come to their senses and re-publish this magnificent film in it's entirety.  It's like eating a hamburger without mayonaise and onions.
0393307050|5.0|First, let me say that this review is really more about the entire Aubrey-Maturn series than this particular book. But it really must be so; you would be missing out on a fantastic experience if you read only this first book. You wouldn't read just the first book of The Lord of the Rings, would you? Then don't even consider just reading this book without reading at least a few others in the series (this is really just a clever subterfuge on my part; once you read 2 or 3 of the books, you won't be able to stop until you've read the entire series!).   <br /> <br />There are lots of literary niches, or genres. Spy novels, horror novels, romances, detective stories, etc. It would be damning this series with faint praise to extol it simply in terms of it being about naval warfare in the early 1800's.  <br /> <br />In fact, when I first saw this series (an intimidating 20 volumes), I thought \\"how many ways are there of describing a broadside?\\" Oh, how little I knew... <br /> <br />It's true that this series features rollicking adventure, but it includes so much more: a deep, complex relationship between the two main characters, political intrigue, espionage, and so much more. It is so much richer and more wonderfully complex even than Forester's much-beloved Horatio Hornblower series.  <br /> <br />Some authors find success with a particular style of book, and basically crank out volume after volume of basically the same story. How ironic it is, then, that in this long series featuring the same characters that there is such variety! <br /> <br />One warning: there is a lot of naval jargon in the books. It can be off-putting at first, but don't let it discourage you. It is really just the \\"background noise\\" of the story, much like the legal jargon in a courtroom drama. That said, I strongly recommend the purchase of \\"A Sea of Words\\" by Dean King as a companion book. I have found that it enhanced my enjoyment of this series.  <br /> <br />Be warned: after experiencing the incredible character development, rich detail, and brilliant plots of this series, you will be less tolerant of much of the drivel that passes for good writing nowadays. <br /> <br />One final comment: even if O'Brian had simply made up the historical events and details of daily shipboard life, it would be a terrific read. The fact that he did painstaking research worthy of a world-class historian, and that he often dropped his fictional characters smack-dab in the middle of historically accurate events just adds an extral layer of amazement and wonder to my appreciation of these superb stories.

B00007KWHO|3.0|Magnification this isn't, but all in all, Time And A Word isn't a bad album.  But I'm sure that if Yes had it to do over again, there would be absolutely no orchestra interfering with the music here.<br /><br />It ruins a lot of perfectly good moments, most notably \\"The Prophet,\\" an otherwise enjoyable song that is made nearly unlistenable with the ugly orchestration poking its head in.  The same applies to \\"Then.\\"  \\"Clear Days\\" is up there with \\"Circus Of Heaven\\" and \\"The Ancient\\" as Yes songs so bad they make me want to gag- the string section on this song sounds so completely ridiculous and out of place.  Even Jon Anderson's lovely vocal delivery doesn't redeem it much.<br /><br />The opening piece, \\"No Opportunity Necessary, No Experience Needed,\\" is the only song featuring the orchestra that isn't dragged down by it; indeed, it actually adds a touch of drama to the song.  In fact, it kind of sounds a little overdramatic, almost ironic, but maybe I'm reading too much into it.<br /><br />It's no surprise that two of the best songs on Time And A Word are the only two that don't feature the orchestra- \\"Sweet Dreams\\" and \\"Astral Traveller.\\"  \\"Sweet Dreams\\" is a fun and light song that sounds like something off of Rubber Soul (but then again, a lot of the songs on the first two Yes albums sound like The Beatles).  \\"Astral Traveller,\\" the best song on the album, is a dark and moody piece that features heavy organ work from Tony Kaye- he dominates the entire album, but he really shines on this song.  I like the big, unexpected rock `n' roll finish.<br /><br />The title track, which closes the album, doesn't feature the orchestra prominently, and it's a harmless, contagious little song.  \\"There's a time, and the time is now and it's right for me, and the time is now, there's a word, and the word is love and it's right for me-\\" trust me, you won't be able to get it out of your head.<br /><br />If you want Yes with a symphony orchestra, Magnification is the way to go, but overall, Time And A Word is worth listening to for all that the orchestra didn't ruin.way to go, but overall, Time And A Word is worth listening to for all that the orchestra didn't ruin.
0783225881|1.0|On the surface, Field of Dreams is about the loss of American innocence and the attempt to find healing <br />and wholeness: Kevin Costner plays a baby boomer who, like many of that era, fell out of favour with his <br />father through the course of the turbulent 60s.  Costner marries a fellow 60s student traveller and finds  <br />himself in a sort of self-imposed exile as a farmer in rural Iowa.  One day, as he is in his corn field, he hears <br />a voice that tells him to Build it and he will come.  Costner eventually intuits that this mysterious voice and <br />instruction is connected to he and his father's never having resolved their growing apart.  Costner then  <br />determines that what he is supposed to do is build a baseball field in his corn field and his father's favourite <br />player, Shoeless Joe Jackson, will appear.  On the surface, Jackson, a member of the White Sox team that <br />threw a world series, represents the tie and bond between father and son and serves as a source of the  <br />re-discovery of what is elemental and good about America as supposedly manifested in baseball.  Here,  <br />however, is where the cryptocracy of Hollywood uses subtle symbolic archetypal imagery to affect a more <br />sinister processing of the Societal Mind.  The set-up begins with a loss of innocence, a Fall, where the son <br />is alienated from the Father.  Shoeless Joe Jackson, describe in the movie as the most elegant and dazzling <br />player, is essentially Lucifer, a favoured angel that falls and eventually causes a rupture between God and  <br />Mankind.  In Hollywood gnostic -- kaballistic -- masonic manipulation, however, Shoeless Joe is unjustly  <br />condemned.  After Costner builds his field and Shoeless Joe arrives, played by Roy Liotta, he tells Costner <br />there are more players coming, since he represents only one player of a team of nine.  This number is roughly <br />one third of a baseball team, one third being the percentage of angelsin Heaven that fell with Lucifer  <br />according to the Holy tradition of the Church.  The townspeople consider Costner crazy since only he and  <br />his family can see the players out on the field, indicating the fact that the others have not yet been initiated. <br />At this point, Costner receives another message which takes him in a search for a J.D. Salingeresque figure <br />who wrote brillant, mind-expanding novels in the 60s but has since fallen silent.  This character is played <br />by James Earl Jones which provides an alchemical element of black and white to the set-up.  Here, Jones  <br />would seem to be the magus who will provide the alchemical initiation for the New Age.  Once back home,  <br />as foretold by the original voice and Jones' character toward the end, masses of people turn off the highway <br />running by Costner's rural farm to see the Black Sox play again.  Build it and he will come sounds like a <br />recipe for building the political spiritual order necessary for the appearance of the fallen and their human agent <br />as prophesied in Daniel and Revelation.  The Hollywood cryptocracy has once again produced a coded  <br />movie that at its core slanders the Truth of the Gospel of Christ by a subtle means of pyschological processing <br />whereby people open themselves up to this false New Age and its promises.
B00005JNEI|4.0|Michael Moore himself says that he made this film specifically to get George W. Bush out of office.  Of course, he also is out to make money.  No one can deny that this movie really cashed in on the latter goal. <br /> <br />With regards to the first goal, this film does an excellent job.  Rarely is the most effective way to gain votes for a particular candidate to actually cater to undecideds by rationally convincing them to vote for the desired candidate.  Rather, it's to energize those that already support the candidate in question to actually get out and vote.  As such, the movie does an excellent job energzing Kerry Supporters to get angry enough at Bush to vote, and in some cases, actually get involved in the campaign.   <br /> <br />Ifyou're an undecided voter looking for rational guidance, this movie is clearly not for you.  No one that either already likes Bush or is undecided is going to see anything compelling here -- far too much of the movie is intentionally biased and overtly presented in a way as to deliberately make Bush look worse than he deserves (which is quite an accomplishment, since he is quite adept at making himself look terrible without any outside help).  This movie is quite humorous in the process, so it definitely earns high marks as a fun way to spend a couple of hours.  However, it earns poor marks for actual informational value -- which is of concern in a movie that bills itself as a documentary, and why I docked it a star.  This movie will make Kerry supporters mad enough that they'll be more likely to vote, but won't actually cause anyone to learn anything they didn't already know or believe anything they didn't already believe. <br /> <br />See this movie cause it's fun, and, if you're liberal, to get energized.  Don't see it to get any sort of decent political content.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|well first of all, I still think she can do better, but this is probably her best CD yet, here`s what i think of the songs...<br />1. Me against the music feat. Madonna: this is a good dancy club song. 9/10<br />2.(I got that) boom boom feat. ying yang twins: I usually skip this one, I don`t like it, least fav. on the CD,would be better without the twins. 1/10<br />3.

Touch of my hand: this one is cool but i doubt it will ever be a single with the message of it, very cool music though. 9/10<br />9.

B0001ZMWQO|4.0|I got myself hooked on \\"Take Me Out\\" after hearing it once.  It was stuck in my head for days, so I went out and bought the album. <br /> <br />My first impression was that this was a local quality band, and didn't care for many of the tracks.  But as I was driving from Florida to Virginia, I had alot of time to give it a chance and I'm glad I did. <br /> <br />I like the album from beginning to end.  Overall, Franz is not as tight as they could be and I feel they try to cover up their lack of experience with too much distortion.  I dig it anyway, and hope they have another album in the future with a more mature sound.
B00008WG3U|4.0|NOFX rules! <br />If you vote for BUSH do not buy this album in fact just stick to your country music. I think NOFX would agree that you are an idot if you vote BUSH .  This album rocks buy it!!! vote kerry for president you wont regret it!!
B000000HU0|4.0|1974's You had showed Gong at their peak, closing off the Radio Gnome trilogy with what had to be their finest album. Daevid Allen, Gilli Smyth, and Tim Blake had all left the band after that album. Steve Hillage got to work on his first solo album, Fish Rising (which basically featured all the Gong members, plus Dave Stewart and Lindsay Cooper, minus of course, Allen). That left Gong with Didier Malherbe, Pierre Moerlen, Mike Howlett, and Mireille Bauer. Vocal duties were now handled by Howlett, and they decided to add a Frenchman by the name of Patrice Lemoine to handle the keyboards. Lemoine was obviously a much more conventional keyboardist than Tim Blake, so no fancy VCS-3 synth bubbles and spacy Moog leads. Instead he went for a Fender Rhodes electric piano and a Mini Moog played more in the fusion manner. Without Daevid Allen anymore, it's no surprise that stories of the Planet Gong and Pot Head Pixies were absent, but the lyrics often still remained quirky, especially \\"Wingful of Eye\\". Some of the songs on this album have a rather strong ethnic bent to them, especially \\"Bambooji\\". \\"Chandra\\" shows the band at their more fusion-oriented side. \\"Cat in Clark's Shoe\\" is a rather quirky number, gets a little cheesy in places, especially when you have an Argentine by the name of Jorge Pinchevesky provide some violin. He was a guest on the album and apparently a fixture in Argentina's music scene. Steve Hillage is now pretty much credited as a guest on this album, as he'd be going solo full time after this album. Shamal shows that Gong was still able to make some great music without the presence of the Pot Head Pixie crew. Unfortunately, for me, I felt the band moved to more conventional fusion after this album that didn't do much for me. But for Shamal, it's still another recommended album if you like Gong, although of course, I prefer You.
B000092ZYX|5.0|In the evolution of Radiohead, the forward progress has stopped.  After experimenting with more generic rock (Pablo Honey), sadness incarnate (The Bends), music for nonhumans (OK Computer), and synthetic sounds (Amnesiac and Kid A), Radiohead has decided not to pioneer a new area of music, but to balance their many styles in absolute perfection. <br />OK Computer and The Bends are Radiohead's best CDs.  Until Hail to the Theif.  There is definitely more here lyrically than in OK Computer.  If you simply look over the lyrics, Radiohead's power will become apparent. <br />Unlike other bands, Radiohead makes you wait for lead singer Thom Yorke to voice any of his poetry, pulling you along with amazing melodies.  You wait for the next time Thom begins to sing. <br />The best songs one here are 2+2=5, Backdrifts, Myxomatosis, and A Wolf at the Door.  This last song ends the CD, and is possibly the best song since Paranoid Android.   <br />See the improvemnt in the always-exception first song: <br />Airbag (OO Computer) vrs. 2+2=5 (Hail): <br />in an interstellar burst, I am back to save the universe <br />or <br />are you such a dreamer to put the worlds to rights...because YOU HAVE NOT BEEN PAYING ATTENTION! <br />I would opt for the second one.  Hail to the Thief is the most perfectly balanced CD I have ever heard, incorporating bits of every previous song Radiohead has ever performed.  I can say nothing more because it will have no further meaning
B00005JMUA|2.0|ZZZZZZZZ... Part 1 was good, but someone needs to do an intervention with Quentin. Not every word that he produces on the page is gold. Some of it is out and out awful. Examples: Huge chunks of David Carradine's speeches at the end, and Darryl Hannah's snake/notebook crap. A good editor could have made this movie at least a half hour shorter. Even the most indulgent Italian westerns weren't paced as glacially as this mess. <br /> <br />A few good action scenes, but little else to recommend for two and a half hours of your time.
B0001ZMWQO|3.0|I bought this album because it has been getting hyped and praised like crazy everywhere. I listen to a lot of new music and I own quite a few albums released this year, Franz Ferdinand's self titled debut is right in the middle of them all. This is no way the best album of the year but it's far from the worst. The opening track \\"Jacqueline\\" is one of the high points of the whole album with a really catchy guitar part that you can almost dance to, which seems to be the focus of the whole album. This album is harmless fun. Franz Ferdinand don't stretch any boudaries here, they simply stick to a formula that they seem to do well. I like this more than anything the Strokes have done but it will most likely be lost among the many far better releases in 2004.
B00005R2M3|5.0|I absolutely adored this album! I heard \\"Whenever, Wherever\\" and I fell in love with this singer. I have been tempted to get her previous Spanish language albums, but haven't gotten around to it yet. I like the fact that she produced and wrote everything on this album. We seriously need more singer/songwriters in this world. <br /> <br />1)Objection (Tango)- Great rock song to kick off her English debut album! This song is very good with a great tango beat (hence the title) 5/5 <br /> <br />2)Underneath Your Clothes- Very beautiful ballad with excellent lyrics. This song is about looking on the inside, not base on looks. 4/5 <br /> <br />3)Whenever, Wherever- The first hit single that took the world by storm. Beautiful lyrics, great beat and really makes you want to get up and dance. 4/5 <br /> <br />4)Rules- This is one of my favorites and really should've been a single, but alas, it was not to be. But this song has a great beat and great lyrics. 5/5 <br /> <br />5)The One- This song is very good, and a beautiful ballad about her boyfriend. The lyrics are very honest and straight to the point. It's one of my favorite songs. 5/5 <br /> <br />6)Ready For The Good Times- A dance song, very upbeat. Kinda wierd lyrics, but a fun song about letting loose and having FUN!!!  4/5 <br /> <br />7)Fool- This is another of my favorite songs off this album. Great honest lyrics, good beat. 5/5 <br /> <br />8)Te Dejo Madrid- Despite the fact that I can't speak or understand Spanish to save my life, I LOVE singing this song even though I don't understand the lyrics. It's a very good song with a good beat. This is definitely one of my favorites!!! 5/5 <br /> <br />9)Poem To A Horse- Weird song title, some wierd lyrics, but it is a good song that I enjoy a LOT! It's about a guy who is too wrapped up in himself. 5/5 <br /> <br />10)Que Me Quedes Tu- Another song that I don't understand because it's in Spanish, yet that does not stop me from enjoying it IMMENSELY! I never took Spanish(I took Latin, don't ask me why...), but I love this song. 5/5 <br /> <br />11)Eyes Like Yours (Ojos Asi)- I love the Arabian beat to this, though I could've done without the male vocal... but it is still a REALLY good song, it is my FAVORITE! and the BEST song on this CD. 5/5 <br /> <br />12)Suerte- This is the Spanish version of \\"Whenever, Wherever\\". For some reason, I love the Spanish versions better than the English versions of this song and the \\"Objection (Tango) song. 5/5 <br /> <br />13)Te Aviso, Te Anuncio (Tango)- The Spanish version of \\"Objection (Tango)\\". The lyrics are faster, and I love this version more than the English version. 5/5 <br /> <br />Overall, this is a very good album. It's full of songs that will get you up and dancing as well as powerful ballads. Shakira is a talented singer, not as talented as Mariah, Celine, or Anastacia, but still one of the best!

Breathe, Time, <br />Money, Us And Them are particularly memorable songs,  <br />with Brain Damage being average, even though it has <br />The Dark Side of The Moon theme, so you can consider <br />it the title track for the album, even though the <br />album is titled something different. Speak To Me is a  <br />nice little instrumental that is a good introduction  <br />that fits seamlessly into the next track which is the  <br />first song. Eclipse nicely rounds out the songs and <br />the album itself. I would consider it an essential <br />recording. I was lucky to purchase this at a significant <br />discount. I also own the audio cassette version of this <br />album with the original black background, but this  <br />version is arguably superior. My advice is to pick it <br />up if you don't already own it, or if you want to  <br />upgrade from audiocassette or vinyl album. If you don't <br />like prog rock or the so-called art rock, you would <br />probably want to give this album a miss.

B000LE16VW|4.0|I have loved the movie Ghost since I was a little girl, and I first taped it off the TV. How sad. But even now, with the special edition DVD, and the fact that I'm now in my twenties, doesn't make watching the \\"two deaths\\"/shadow demons bit any easier. That totally freaked me out as a kid, and even now, I had to turn away, even the sound sent shivers up my spine. Apparently, the sound is babies screaming, but slowed down. Ugh. I've progressed from hiding behind the couch, to hiding behind a cushion, to turning my face away, and closing my eyes. My aren't I growing up.<br /><br />Ghost is definitely a classic of the nineties, and I can't believe so many actors turned down the role of Sam Wheat, because they felt it wouldn't work. Even the director thought Patrick Swayze wasn't right for the role, and has famously said (and denies it) that he would have Patrick for the role \\"over his dead body\\".<br /><br />Ghost stories can sometimes be overdone in the world of film, but this is done with some sensitivity, and also from the ghost's point of view. Doesn't make me any keener on Demi Moore's hairstyle in this.  The only hairstyle worse than this is the one she sported in GI Jane. Not a good look. I have to disagree with other reviewers that say this is a great date movie. It's not. I wouldn't even dream of even asking my boyfriend to watch this with me. Probably cos he wouldn't like it, and would hate every minute of it. But we can't all like the same stuff.<br /><br />I did have a few problems with one of the extras on this DVD though. I just re-read my old Amazon review and here's what I originally said about the extras: \\"There's a lack of extras on this DVD, apart from a trailer, a commentary, and \\"interviews with the cast\\" - which is basically re-showing the whole movie all over again! Think of the most boring extras ever, and bam, there they are on the Ghost DVD. Please, use your imagination for once.\\"<br /><br />They have taken my advice (why wouldn't they?), the extras are short & sweet, but I think the same featurette from the first edition is on the first disc of this edition, which isn't too bad. But then I put on the second disc, watched the first featurette - and it's almost word perfect, clip perfect of the same featurette, just a couple of years on. And I'm very disappointed that the interview with Demi Moore is a very old interview. Patrick, and the director, and the screenwriter came back for new interviews, but hers is old.<br /><br />All the actors do a brilliant job, but I did feel the whole storyline with Carl, Sam's best friend, and his girlfriend, Molly, (where he pours coffee over himself and removes his shirt to show off his physique) was unnecessary. And it didn't quite work with the tone of the rest of the film either. Tony Goldwyn did an alright role, but that whole segment for me just didn't feel right. As if the audience would believe Molly would go with Carl, who was Sam's best friend, just after he'd died.<br /><br />The major scene stealer in this film, who quite rightly should have had more screen time, was the late great Vincent Schiavelli, who died from lung cancer at the end of 2005. He was one of the great character actors, and although he was simply credited in this as Subway Ghost, he stole the show from Patrick, and was just amazing. He's well missed. If I mention Vincent Schiavelli, I also have to mention the actor who played Willie Lopez, Rick Aviles. He also sadly died in 1995, from AIDS.<br /><br />What I think would have made this film work even more, is if Molly had found out she was pregnant with Sam's baby. But is that too much? I think it would have made the ending so sweet if she'd told him she was pregnant. But then it could have sent it into OTT schmaltzy. But what pregnancy wouldn't be good in a film?<br /><br />I absolutely LOVE the score to this film, and that's something coming from me, cos I often have trouble with scores on films. Play me them back, and I won't have a CLUE what film it's from. And the film is enhanced by the song \\"Unchained Melody\\" which became a hit all over again. But my problem with that song now is that it's been covered so many times, but it's never been covered (to my knowledge), nor has it ever charted, by a female singer. I think it would add a whole other element to the song if it was sung by a woman.<br /><br />What you'll discover after watching, is that clay could be so sexy! I did pottery during school, and although I never mastered it, it's something I would like to have a go at again. But I'm certain none of the guys in my class ever jumped on me as he did to Demi.<br /><br />This is a brilliant movie and definitely should be in everyone's collection. It's one you can take out at anytime and put on, and be instantly happy.<br /><br />And on that note: Ditto.won't have a CLUE what film it's from.

B00005JN2X|5.0|\\"Collateral\\" has got to be one of the best and most excitiing crime thrillers made in years!!! It is a two-hour adrenaline rush from start to finish, filled with gritty action, and outstanding performances. I kid you not, from the minute Tom Cruise gets into the cab, the movie never slows down!!  <br /> <br />This movie is going to set Jamie Foxx up for a whole bunch of great roles in the future and along with the biography of the late-great Ray Charles he is set to star in later this year, this will be a huge year for him. <br /> <br />The Plot: Some of the plot might be a little hard to understand at first, so let me iron it out for you. The movie is about a contract killer (Cruise), who forces a cabbie (Foxx) to drive him around as he commits his series of murders. The hits that he has to make are witnesses in a drug case where Cruise's boss (played flawlessly by Javier Bardem) is the one on trial.  <br /> <br />The intensity and energy of the movie will keep you in tune to it throughout and the last 20 minutes will have you on the edge of your seat!!!  <br /> <br />This movie is not getting hundreds of good reviews for nothing!! If you want to actually get your money's worth and have fun at the movies definitely go see \\"Collateral.\\"
B0002TT0NW|5.0|<br /> I saw the movie in the theaters and fell in love with it. Compared to the other two movies it really sticks out. The use of computer animation is unbelievable. The dementors rock!! <br /> It is a must see!! <br /> <br />
B00005JMUA|5.0|Of course,in the process of viewing this review you should know that the first film involved the elimination of two ex-partners of the lead, The Bride.  Obviously, this is a continuation of said film, and now to what I'll consider the review portion. <br />Uma Thurman plays a vengeful woman who seeks to destuction of those who betrayed her and attempted to murder her.  She lived, but many of those she knew and loved were killed, and after reviving from a coma she seeks revenge.  Having killed two of five on her list, she continues forth in a film that would appear almost completely different from the other volume.  More dialogue driven, the story becomes thickened with intriguing comments and unravelling of small details and comparisons that keep our minds attached, as we slowly develope the awareness of where things head.  Beyond this would ruin the story, so I'll put this briefly.  Through moments of wonder, action, and anticipation, Quentin Tarrintino never lets us go by keeping us glued to the story in ways it would appear only he could achieve.  A fabulous film, not to be seen before volume one of course, that almost supercedes its predecessor in an sheer fantastic story that never stops poking at the mere concept of entertainment.  Check it out, I can practically quarantee your satifaction.  Thanks for reading.
B00005JNEI|4.0|Ive been taught in my life to look at all the issues. While my familly has always voted on the side of the right wing, i was always told to think for myself. I know the differences in this country are whos on the right or left, and whos loyal to which side. I am more of a realist though, when it comes to the facts. While this movie does it best in showing you how much the president is incopitent in the handling of the countries afairs, it should be taken into consideration that this particullar administation, not all republicans are to blame. Having both my father and step father serve in vietnam, both enlisted men, come back and protest against what was going on showed me at a very early age the great country in which we live. These people sacrificed their lives for the good of this country. Blindly going into war just for the sake of america. They both lost many good friends, loved ones, and still grieve to this day. Seeing what we're in war for, and why were their is a travesty. Especially when people in office are benifiting handsomely while the common americans die denfending us from something that never threatend us. It is just a case of using common sence. IF you dont agree with bush, or kerry, look at what nader has to offer. just use your heads. Ignorance is bliss. But when the facts are presented to you in clear view IT is your duty as americans TO take a stand. TO honor all of those who have protected, and those who have died trying to protect our rights. Look at the deficite, look at the unemployment, and think what your children will have to endure in order to survive. If this administation is not serving the genneral publics best interest something must be done. Common sence also has alot to do with name calling as well. Calling someone Fat because they dont hold your idea of whats right is, to say the very least, a frustated at the facts statement. wheather you like Moore or not, he has provided the facts, what ever order they are in, They are the facts. Pretend bush is neither a repeblican or democrat. and vote with your consience. Or continue the name calling and watch the country split even further. We must all work together to heal the country. If we dont try and work together what are we hear for? Every one has different opinions, but unless we actually try we will fall.
B00005U122|4.0|After glancing over some of the reviews, I think its evident that Pink Floyd will never be better than it was. This DVD isn't about Roger trying to outdo the past. It's about giving the fans what they want. David and CO. can hire on whomever they want and the truth is, they can't reproduce Roger's concepts, lyrics or music! But the simple fact of the matter is......Roger can't replace one of the greatest Lead Guitarist ever!! So, you see, there is no debate, unless your completely turned off by one of their styles. <br /> <br />This DVD has nothing to do with what fans know about music. Such an idiotic claim. If you have have decided in one's own mind to side with the Roger or Dave crew, than fine. I'm not going to debate the obvious.  <br /> <br />I have enjoyed viewing this concert but the truth be known, it isn't a 5* rating as compared to viewing Roger Live in concert. I would have revised some of the choices on the playlist and dropped songs such as; Money, ABITW and others which have been re-produced a dozen of times on other releases. <br /> <br />Also, imagine the stir this DVD would have caused if Nick Mason would have shown up on here, instead of later on?? I'm sure Dear Ol' Dave, would have loved that!  <br /> <br />Enjoy the memories.......these guys arn't getting any younger!!
B000003TSP|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Bjrk and one day I was searching online for related artists. The name Portishead was listed, so I sampled their CD \\"Portishead\\" and decided to buy it. This was one of the smartest things I've EVER done! \\"Portishead\\" is without a doubt one of the greatest albums ever created.  I love eerie, dark, unique trip-hop music and I can't imagine somebody NOT liking Portishead.  The first song I heard was \\"All Mine\\" and I liked it, but my absolute favorite is \\"Undenied\\". I love the calm, dark aura and the melancholic atmosphere of the song. Beth Gibbons has a uniquely awesome voice that some people think is \\"scratchy\\" or \\"bad\\", but I think her voice is perfect for the nature of the group itself.  I also love \\"Half Day Closing\\", \\"Over\\", \\"Cowboys\\", and \\"Western Eyes\\", but there's no song that I don't like.  I NEVER EVER EVER get tired of listening to this album b/c I love evth about it! It hits every sad emotion: depression, loneliness, melancholy, confusion, fear, anger, etc. THIS is what music SHOULD be like; Portishead aren't played on the radio b/c it's TOO GOOD! No amount of money is NOT worth buying this album -- I promise that you won't be unsatisfied!

B0000025ZF|4.0|First Roger solo album, not a bad showing. However, upon further review and listenings to entire LIVE productions of this gem, I have concluded that I think Roger should have toned down all the heavy studio stuff and just played it out LIVE, as in one take. Keep all the gimmicks in it and allow for the opportunity to improvise in extended solos! I barely listen to the original and have spent more time listening in on the Radio Music City Hall BOOT which really brought all the music on this record together!    I know it may seem odd to rate this a \\"4\\", however, I love this record, I just feel it could have been PRODUCED better!!

B00003CX95|5.0|I watched Gladiator and thought no movie would be like it, but when I watched Braveheart it really touched my heart. I can say it's the best movie I've ever watched!
B0002DB0FO|5.0|This has to be one of the most enjoyable series on t.v. at the moment.  I dont know about anyone else, but I am very very tired of adding one more 'cop show' to my list of watchables.  this show is a wonderful mixture of day to day REAL LIFE, without the unnecessary violence.  While it does have some controversial topics, they are topics that do need to be dealt with and for some families, they need to be dealt with in the present.  Treat Williams' character, Dr. Brown, has a charisma that would make anyone like him, and he does.  While the rest of the cast is very enjoyable, I must say that Dr. Brown is by far my favorite.  I especially love the naration by Irv (john beasley) it adds an emotional quality and puts the storyline into perspective (and sometimes brings a tear to my eye). Debra Mooney plays Dr. Brown's nurse, (Dr. Abbott's mother) and adds a bit of spice to the show, this show could not do without her.  After every episode, I always get the feeling i want to pack up and move to a small town in Colorado......... I do hope that this show continues and i can guarantee you, I will be watching.
6303314015|5.0|I really love this movie it was so cute and the songs were great I gave my neice this movie when she was born and she watches it all the time and she is 7 years old now Thanks to everyone who created it your the best
B00005JMUA|2.0|I really liked the first part of this film.  I could have done without the scenes with Buck, the orderly, but you take the good with the bad.  The second part shows us why Harvey Weinstein is a rich man.  He realized that the second half of Kill Bill was pretty much a let down after the really dynamic and creative first half.  Part of the problem lies with manifesting Bill.  I liked the show Kung-fu, the show that made David Carridine well known.  That was when I was a kid.  If you watch that show now it is easy to see that Carridine was not in any way a skilled martial artist.  Unfortunately, for Quentin Tarintino, he still isn't and he is now an older man.  So here you have the first film creating the image of a real hard core, stone cold killer swordsman, and Carradine cannot pull it off.  Next, the music is completely forgetable. The characters of Michael Madsen and Daryl Hannah are vulgar and uninteresting.  Tarantino was forced to make the death of Bill as uninteresting as it was because Carradine couldn't carry out the O-Ren type of duel or the all out brawl of the house fight at the start of Kill Bill. I did like the Pro-life message that you had in the hotel room fight.  Watch Kill Bill, and skip vol. 2.  You will not be missing anything by doing this, and you will preserve David Carradine's finest work as the killer, Bill.  It may sound funny after this review, but Carradine was great in the first film.  He was creepy, and invincible.  Too bad they made the second part of this film.
0790729350|4.0|GIMME AN F!!!     This is one of the most significant events in modern history, 500,000 people coming together overcoming the elements to enjoy a weekend of music in upstate NY.     They have never been able to repeat such a feat, although Live Aid and Live 8 have come somewhat close, on a more global level.     The original 3 hour Oscar winning version is classic and the amount of time is just right, and should be available on DVD as well. In my mind, this is the definitive rock concert film (Stop Making Sense and Last Waltz are more intimate affairs), and everyone looks like magnificent rock gods (or rock cliches) from beginning to end.     They could also do an alternate version that doesn't use the splitscreen,and instead using DVD angles to choose which screen to view. Or for the missing footage, they could always put it in an \\"extras\\" and put the music to the photos.     A big reason why there hasn't been more footage released from the concert is in big part due to the reluctance for some bands to release footage they consider subpar, and others weren't (supposedly) completely filmed. It would be great to see complete performances from all the bands, unfortunately only Hendrix has been the only performance released as complete as possible.     There have been documentaries on TV about Woodstock, why not release them? Or make a completely new one for the box set? Martin Scorsese has done commentaries on just about everything he's worked on, and the recent \\"No Direction Home\\" about Dylan and \\"The Blues\\", back to \\"The Last Waltz\\" all start out with this film (George Lucas worked on \\"Gimme Shelter\\"). There have to be tons of interview footage left on the cutting room floor as well as new interviews that could be added here.     People will want to know how something like this was pulled off, and others have failed miserably ever since, not to mention Woodstock 94 and 99 trying to recreate (94 turned out fine, but 99 was another story) but coming up short. There'sa lot of archive footage of Janis and Jimi talking about it, Joni Mitchell (on the recently released Dick Cavett Rock Icons DVD) writing \\"Woodstock\\" even though she never made it, and countless others that were a part of it.     The Grateful Dead have kept their performance off of the video (they had to stop playing because things kept cutting out, the audio of their set is pretty easy to find), \\"Dark Star\\" is actually pretty good, and it's not really as bad as they've made it out to be.     There's very little in the way of CSNY live, makes no sense whatsoever to not include Neil Young. Same thing with CCR, The Band, Mountain (including a then recently solo Jack Bruce), Melanie and a complete set of Janis Joplin. Definitely more Who (esp. the Abbie Hoffman incident, prob. one of their most intense shows), Paul Butterfield,and more Sly and the Family Stone. Footage of a lot of the bands that were there is extremely rare. It would be great to see long-forgotten bands like Sweetwater and Quill as well.     Hopefully this will be on Warner's agenda to put something out to the public as big and brash as this concert was, even if it winds up being 10 DVDs (or a CD/DVD box kitchen sink box set)long. It should all be there for the public to see and hear as if they were there.
B00005JKG9|5.0|Good portrayal of a greedy business world gone mad. The characters are chilling in their greed and the selfishness.  <br /> <br />
B0001MDP3G|5.0|\\"Cold Mountain\\" is a spectacular achievement in filmmaking, certainly one of the most impressive films I've seen in quite a while.  The movie is epic in every sense of the word, and instantly draws you into a deeply beautiful and deeply flawed world.  The movie has bascially two simultaneous storylines; one is about Confederate soldier \\"WP Inman\\" who will embark on an Oddyssey-like journey to hell and back in order to return home to the woman he loves.  The other is a wonderful and complex story about the relationship between two women in desperate times.   <br /> <br />     The scale and ambitions of this movie are grand, and would have certainly collapsed on itself under the hands of less capable filmmakers.  I am deeply impressed that they were able to make such a long, complex, and involved film as coherent and spectacular to watch as they were able to.  It IS indeed a long film, but you will not be bored.  The director handles the storyline with such mastery that we are in his spell and cannot extricate ourselves. <br /> <br />     This is especially surprisingly considering how  <br />little \\"action\\" there is in the movie.  The opening battle scene of the Siege of Petersburg is utterly stunning to watch, but that's about it for battle scenes.  The rest of the movie is much more subtle, and the most exciting things are done with a look of the eye, with innuendo, with what is not said.  I found it similar in style and tone with the also amazing film \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring\\".  This then brings me to the acting.  Fantastic acting from top to bottom; bravo to the filmmakers for not blowing all the money and effort on gratuitous special effects, and instead letting the actors ACT.  And act they do. <br /> <br />     Jude Law is extremely impressive in his role as the poigant and determined Inman.  He never overacts, letting his eyes do most of the storytelling of his internal turmoils.  The depth of his acting skills comes through in this film very well, andhe portrays brilliantly that tinge of sadness and poignancy to his character, which we as the audience can't quite put our finger on, but is vital to the film.  Nicole Kidman's (as Ada) southern accent is less than impressive, but the rest of her acting is quite satisfying. <br /> <br />     The real revelation and show-stealer however, is the incredible acting of Renee Zellweger (as Ruby).  Zellweger completely blew me away with her utterly convincing portrayal of an irresistibly likeable character.  Ruby is the tough-as-nails farmgirl/tomboy who comes to \\"rescue\\" Ada after Ada's father dies, and there is no one to tend to the farm.  Ada is a proper lady who plays piano with no knowledge of farming.  Together the girls survive and thrive, and develop a very special relationship. <br /> <br />     I found an undeniably romantic subtext between Ada and Ruby's relationship, and frankly I'm rather surprised that very few people have commented on this.  Personally I felt the subtext was so strong that if it were any stronger, it would become \\"text\\".  To me it's far and away the most fascinating part of the story; although Nicole Kidman and Jude Law's respective characters are supposed to be star-crossed soulmates, I found that Kidman has far more chemistry with Zellweger than she ever did with Law.  Ada and Ruby's chemistry crackles and pops like a warm fire on a cold winter night.  From the moment Ruby walked onto the farm I suspected, and my suspicion only grew as the movie progressed.  Consider the scene when she dreamily listens to Ada play the piano; consider the \\"bracelet scene\\"; consider towards the end when Ruby steps aside and lets Inman and Ada have the hut to themselves, whilst Ruby goes to the other hut to sleep with her father.  A single tear rolls down her cheek.  It seems clear to me that Ruby is completely in love with Ada.  And frankly, I am insulted by the heterosexual relationship and husband which were eventually forced on her character, and forceddown our throats.  It felt artificial, absurd, contrived, and completely inconsistent with the development of her character.  I'm not saying she and Ada should have gotten together (since Ada clearly is not lesbian), but I would have preferred to leave Ruby's sexual orientation much more ambiguous and letting the audience decide at the end of the movie.   <br /> <br />     Natalie Portman has a very good cameo in the film.  In fact all the supporting and cameo roles were done very well.  Portman, my favourite actress and dream lover, presented the biggest temptation to Inman on his journey home, even bigger than the \\"sirens\\" who literally threw themselves at Inman.  And frankly, if it had been me in Natalie Portman's cabin, I don't think I would have ever gotten to Cold Mountain :-p <br /> <br />    Another thing I have to point out is the utterly incredible music of the movie.  Typically I never mention the music in any of my movie reviews, but in this movie the music so well done that it adds a whole other dimension of storytelling.  Especially good is the heartbreakingly poignant, aetherally sung tune that accompanied the opening battle scene, and later scenes as well.  The folksy bluegrass music in general worked spectacularly to transport the audience headfirst into the world of the Civil War South, which the film has so meticulously and richly re-created.   <br /> <br />     Another thing I loved about \\"Cold Mountain\\" is its balanced storytelling; the most beautiful and ugliest sides of the South are both on display, as are those of the North.   <br /> <br />     \\"Cold Mountain\\" is many things.  It is a classic Romeo-and-Juliet love story, a Civil War epic, an homage to Homer's Odyssey, and possibly a lesbian romance.  But however you watch it, it will amaze you and stay with you.
B0000CDL93|4.0|I don't always like watching a movie that pretends to be about history and takes all kinds of liberties.  I'm sure Stone took many liberties in this film, creating kind of a conspiracy paranoia.  Acting was good, and the story was interesting...but IT'S JUST A MOVIE FOLKS!! <br /> <br />
B0001WTUH6|4.0|I have been a big vampire mythology fan for as long as I can remember. I love a good vampire movie. I'm not expecting Masterpiece Theater, I just want to be entertained, and entertained I was with \\"Underworld\\". I missed out seeing the movie when it was in the theaters but I'm glad that I did now that I have seen the extended cut. I'm not really a fan of Kate Beckinsdale film work but she does a great job as death dealer (i.e vampire) Selene. Selene is trying to figure out why the Lycans (i.e werewolves), the vampires' enemies, what they want in Michael Corvin (played by Scott Speedman of \\"Felicity\\" fame). The Lycans and death dealers are at war and have been for centuries. I loved the dark, moody atmosphere of the entire film. I thought it was amazing how the werewolves were actually costumes as opposed to resorting to the cheesy CGI most movies relies on nowadays (which I think is way too much). Kate Beckinsdale looked great in that skintight leather outfight and short dark hair. She reminded me a lot of Toni Halliday, the singer from the modern rock band Curve. The film is very sleek and stylish. I can definitely see where the comparisons of the movie to other films like \\"The Matrix\\" and \\"Blade\\" comes in (like on the fight sequences) but \\"Underworld\\" still holds its own. There really wasn't much of a plot the one big flaw I found with the film but I didn't care. It was a non-stop thrill ride for me. The acting was a bit on the overstated side but like I said, this ain't Masterpiece Theater. If you want Masterpiece Theater, then go watch some (awful) Merchant Ivory film. \\"Underworld\\" is a fun, non-stop rollercoaster ride (or at least I thought). The bonus features on the dvd is awesome. I especially dug the \\"Fangs Vs. Fiction\\" segment and watching the cast of the film talk about making the film. I loved the outtake reel. It is always interesting for me to see the actors goof up on their lines in movies. You don't see that very often except as bonus footage on dvds. I liked the 48 page comic book and the sketchings on the entire film. I am eagerly anticipating the sequel to \\"Underworld\\" where Selene becomes the hunted.I liked the 48 page comic book and the sketchings on the entire film.

0316666343|2.0|Having many friends who recommended this book to me I was sadly disappointed with it. Maybe I'm being stupid as so far I've read only heavy praise but I felt the book sadly lacking in reality and character. Maybe that wasn't the objective of the book but when Susie Salmon fell from heaven I felt that the plot was lost. Maybe I'm not deep enough to grasp the novel. It did however take me; I read it quickly and maybe that was the problem or I'm just not the kind of person who likes reading about a girl who has been raped and murdered and is watching her family have sex and stare her murderer in the face every day. Maybe I'm staring a future classic in the face, or a book which will eventually been forgotten. Who knows.
B000002UA0|5.0|I'm not by any means the biggest Floyd fan considering I only own this and Darkside, but from what i've heard this is the best. The Syd Barrett stuff is just at a different level.    Take the first track \\"Astronomy Domine\\" for example; it gets better every listen. I think there's a good reason for it. The drumming is perfect for psychadelia. It's not a rhythm that gets you up to dance.. it probably does the opposite. The instrumentation is out there and you can't help but picture space. This is, after all, an album that focuses on stealing your imagination. (Maybe not stealing, but it does something!)    From there the album incorporates a lot of separate styles and gives them a psychadellic spin. Matilda Mother has lures me into submission every time. It has one of the most incredible guitar solos i've EVER heard amidst the rhythmic breathing. (I don't know how it doesn't annoy me -- I actually love that part!) Let's not forget Pow R. Toc -- an incredibly trippy jazz track. The album even has a crazy 10 minute song that sounds like it belongs in a score for a bad 70's space movie.    And there's one more thing to note; This is an album before it's time. Alright, i'll level with you folks scrolling through the Pink Floyd reviews... MOST of the 60's music I listen to sounds ahead of it's time. I can't get enough of the 60's. I was born into the wrong generation.
B00008MNYS|5.0|Man, this is a must buy, I don't care if you a Robbie Williams fan or not, this is the type of album you will not wanna take out of your CD player. I usually HATE this kinda music, I'm more of a rap guy. I listen to rap 24/7, but I've had this album for 2 days, and I ain't heard the first rap song. I bought this album along with 'Sing When You're Winning', and I ain't disappointed at all... actually, they're better than I thought. A German girl told me about him and played me a song by him, and I thought he was gay, but I like his music. The 2 best songs on this album are Feel, which is a love song, and Me and my Monkey, which is about him and his mokey checking into a hotel room in Vegas, then the monkey called and escort service. Then 3 monkey [prostitutes] came to the room and the monkey got him some monkey (...). And at the end of the song, Robbie and the monkey kill a Mexican named Seor Rodriguez. I recommend this album to whoever reads this. This guy is off the chain, he off the sheezy. If you like Robbie, this is a must have... if you don't like Robbie, this is still a must have. Ya'll need to cop this album, no lie, straight up. \\"How did I wind up with this f*ckin' monkey anyhow?\\" Robbie Williams, Me and My Monkey. Peace!
B00005V3Z4|4.0|Donnie Darko is a movie that tests the limits of the alienated male teen in the suburbs convention so imaginatively that you hardly notice those patches where the script shows signs of strain. In some ways, he resembles the character Jim Stark portrayed so memorably by James Dean in 'Rebel W/O A Cause'. Just like the old Nick Ray picture, this one wins you over with inspired casting and great performances. Jake Glyllenhaal as Donnie is just brilliant. He looks a little bit like Tobey McGuire and naturally conveys some of McGuire's confused naivete. But Donnie isn't just bemused by typical teen rites of passage, he's delusional and suffering mightily from more than a touch of teen angst. It's like Tobey McGuire meets Kafka and it works.  <br />     What I liked most about the movie were the scenes depicting Donnie with his family. Contrary to the stereotype of misunderstood teen movies, this kid's upper middle class nuke family comes off as very likeable. I've seen the actor who played Donnie's dad before in Election, where he plays an obtuse suburban dad, but in this movie the parents show their troubled son as much love as they're capable of. The mom seems just as confused by her son's troubles as he is. He's got an older and younger sister and though they're not as sensitive to Donnie's condition as one might wish, they're believable. They don't know exactly how to cope with the puzzle he presents. When the family gathers for meals or attend events like the little sister's talent show, you feel a genuine spark of family warmth. They are not the fallguys for Donnie's dementia. And the psychiatrist (played by Katherine Ross. Where have you been since that bike ride with Butch Cassidy  and the big move to Stepford?) seems helpful to the very bright Donnie. Maybe too helpful since any discussion with bright well disposed adults seems to further fuel Donnie's delusions.  <br />      Part of his illness seems tobe that he's really trying to interpret what he encountersin life for it's true meaning. He might be delusional, but he hates lies and inaccuracy. There's a wonderful scene where he and his chums discuss the Smurfs and his buds spin all kinds of hardcore sexual theories based on this innocuous toon and Donnie cogently shuts them up. I'm not that up on the varieties of schizophrenia, but I'm willing to take on faith that this movie gets across what the disease might be like because it gets all kinds of little details about family life and the awfulness of school right.The main character becomes obsessed with a book by a centenarian who used to teach at the school he attends. The title: 'The Philosophy of Time Travel'. The only philosophical proposition held up for inspection by the characters in Donnie Darko is 'all men live and die alone' which Donnie discusses with his shrink. The emotional truth of this statement is borne out by the sad old woman who Donnie fixates on. It's she who tells the poor kid this hard to argue against homely truth. Anyway, we all travel through time, whether we want to or not - and then we don't. If ya ask me, this was a noble little movie <br />
B000002NAK|5.0|\\"Evita\\" is the story of Eva Peron, wife of the dictator Juan Peron. The music is by Andrew Lloyd Webber and the (majority of the) lyrics are by Tim Rice. \\"Evita\\" was originally was staged back in 1978, but now has been revived into a motion picture with Madonna, Antonio Bandares, and Jonathon Pryce, whom all sing wonderfully on this beautiful soundtrack!<br /><br />Many people would probably be interested in this. First of all, Madonna fans should definitely have this by now. Secondly, Antonio Bandares fans should pick up a copy too, even though I didn't particularly care for him in this project. Thirdly, Andrew Lloyd Webber fans should get it for the music and for the song written for this particular version of \\"Evita\\": \\"You Must Love Me,\\" which Madonna performs beautifully.<br /><br />I would recommend you rent/buy the DVD of \\"Evita\\" before you purchase the soundtrack, just to know the story of Evita. Then, if you end up not even liking the music from the movie, you have saved money from not buying the soundtrack. But, chances are, you'll buy it because the music is so good!
B00005JMJ4|4.0|If you appreciate the kind of music that takes you <br />to another place, such as the Cocteau Twins, My Bloody <br />Valentine, Brian Eno, Spacemen 3, Joy Division, Daevid Allen etc.., then this movie is for you. <br /> <br />If classic rock is more your style, you'll be complaining <br />about the lack of special effects, the slow pace of <br />the movie, and you just won't get it, like half of the <br />other reviewers here. <br /> <br />I have never seen a soundtrack complement a movie as well <br />as this one does.  Another review here called the Karoake <br />scene pointless, which means they obviously were not listening <br />to the lyrics of the Roxy Music song \\"More than this\\" that <br />Bill Murray was singing. <br /> <br />A refreshingly different film.
B00005Y1MT|5.0|If you want to get full enjoyment out of this CD, then do what the band suggests in the liner notes, \\"Play it loud with the lights off\\", however, I suggest that you also wear headphones, as there are many very quiet moments that might escape your ears if you don't.  Like the opening line, \\"A Bridge is not a high place...\\" uttered by the girl before the fog horns start blowing.  This whole CD is an entire experience, and you have to listen to it that way.  There's no skipping songs or just listening to the first couple of songs and then shutting it off.  It is the rarest of concept albums, the one that follows its concept from beginning to end.  A lot of people felt it was too emotional, too dark and creepy, to listen to someone's life play out from one bad moment to the next, right from birth to the moment she jumps off the bridge and beyond.  Well, Marillion shed their pop sound of Holidays In Eden sure enough on this outing.  Not to say that Holidays In Eden is a bad CD, on the contrary, but the tone is completely different on this album.  It's able to hold my interest from moment to moment, as the music is so dynamic, soft and slow one moment and loud as hell and frantic the next.  H's lyrics and singing are fantastic here.  He certainly came of age on this album, leaving Holidays and Season's End in the dust.  I don't think I can say enough nice things about this CD.  One thing you'll want to do if you aren't sure what to expect upon first listening, is to listen all the way through without anything going on in the background, at a time when it's just you and the music, and use those headphones, as, like I said, there are many little bits you'll miss otherwise, and make sure you have a hanky or a box of tissues, 'cause if you don't cry at the end, you're either a Vulcan or an android.  The emotion of these songs is intense, to say the least.  Another item you might like to check out is the DVD of their performance of Brave in its entirety at a band convention a few years back.  H's stage presence and performance is inspired.  It can be found online at Marillion dot com or on ebay.  You can also find the album done live on their Made Again CD.  I hope it does for you what it has for me.  Marillion is that band that most everyone either gets or doesn't, and if you get this CD, you'll more than likely get Marillion.  What other band can actually ask their fans to buy their next CD before it's been recorded?!  This band's done it twice now, and the two releases have been great, so if you know of another band that has a fan base that rabid for the next CD to buy it before it's recorded, then I'd like to know about them.  If you're a music lover, do yourself a favor and at least listen to anything recorded by anyone associated with this band.  You'll enjoy yourself very much.few years back.

B00005JLR8|5.0|It seemed promising enough at the beginning for me to go along until the very end where it just pulled the rug from under me, leaving me sobbing senselessly.  Most excellent.
B000085RTZ|4.0|Epica was my introduction to this band, which I picked up in a bargain bin! I was totally amazed by the sound and value that this album contained when I put it in my car cd player for the drive home. To put it mildly - I was blown away! I immediately wanted to go out and buy the rest of their musical catalogue. I would recommend this album to anyone who is a fan of Progressive/Power Metal. But even as those genres can at times seem limited, Kamelot seems to weave impressive writing aspects into their songs - which means that they will appeal to a wider audience. Khan's vocals are superb - he has a wonderful voice that is complemented in grand style by the amazing guitar, drum and bass work on the album throughout. I would recommend this album to anyone in search of an emotional musical ride in grand scale. Apparently, and I cannot confirm this, at this date (but I will), Epica is not their best album! I find this hard to believe - but if it is so,(and I will post another review giving my two cents worth) all I can say is - can't wait.
B00008DDRX|5.0|I just finished watching this one yesterday and I think I really need to go and see a race at Lemans for myself. Steve McQueen was really something here. I couldn't stop watching. Great film in every way.
B00007FOMP|3.0|Ok, so I know saying anything about this record other than \\"this is the most brilliant thing ever recorded\\" is heresy. But come on people. Let's be honest. Can any of you actually tell me that \\"save the children\\" is a great song? Not that is has a great message, or that we shouldn't save children, or that we like children, but that musically, it does ANYTHING for you? by my count this album has 2 very strong songs \\"what's going on\\" and \\"mercy mercy me\\". Everything else is just kind of...there. I know it feels wrong to criticize this album because marvin is calling out for causes that are impossible to oppose like children and trees and people not being dead. That being said, this album contains NOTHING that stevie wonder didn't do better in innervisions. \\"living for the city\\" destroys both \\"what's goin on\\" and \\"mercy mercy me\\". and \\"too high\\" deals with drug addiction much better than marvin. I mean, what is really special about this album? it reads so much better than it sounds, and even in print the lyrics feel painfully obvious and written by an 11 year old. For nuanced, biting social commentary that makes much more of an impact than anything on this album see dylan, bob.  Furthermore, none of the songs in this album hold a candle to other FANTASTIC marvin gaye songs like \\"let's get it on\\" and his version of \\"aint no mountain high enough\\". Bottom line: a so-so album that gets great reviews because people don't wanna be accused of hating children or trees or non-dead people. All the praise is a simple case of \\"follow the leader\\" syndrome.
B0000WN0VY|5.0|FOr anyone out there who gets nauseous every time they click on the radio, for anyone who has been waiting for someone who is actually a musician and not just a gimmic, for anyone who loves GREAT music and has been scraping to find decent artists for the past ten years, BUY THIS, or better yet buy tickets and go see them live. Once you do that you'll know you need this music in your collection! I can't even describe the greatness of this music. You hear this and think it's absolute perfection and then you hear them live and realize it just keeps getting better!!! Amazing!!!
B00005Y228|5.0|I own six Kylie Minogue albums, but I have to say that this is definitely her best effort thus far.  \\"Fever\\" is fun, enjoyable, and just makes you want to dance! <br /> <br />\\"Love At First Sight\\" is probably my favorite track, although I prefer the US radio mix over the original.  \\"Can't Get You Out of My Head\\" really put this album on the map in the US, and it's easy to see why.  Its lyrics are catchy, and the beat is amazing.  \\"Fragile\\", the grammy-winning \\"Come Into My World\\", \\"In Your Eyes\\", \\"Dancefloor\\", and \\"Love Affair\\" are very enjoyable tracks, too.  Finally, I think \\"Burning Up\\" is an excellent closing song.  I totally enjoy the sexy, mellow verses compiled with the upbeat, top-tapping chorus! <br /> <br />Great job, Kylie!
B0001AP12G|4.0|Although I was a little hesitant to stamp Kanye West with unwarranted praise, after buying the album I must say that College Dropout is one of the best Rap CD's I've heard in a long time. With such a unique style and approach its no secret why Kanye has already been branded has one of the best to ever do it. Go Get It !
B00009TB5G|5.0|Its fair enough that some people find this to be boring, after all it's all about personnel tastes etc but I think this is great. The extras seem never to end (in a good way) and the movie continues the story without faltering once.  <br /> I think it's a fair guess that you have already seen if not bought the original. And I shall cut to the chase and say that if you liked the first movie you'll like this and the extras. If you didn't like the original it seems fairly pointless you buying this.  <br />I think that roughly covers everything... <br />...I can only hope I've been of service... <br />...Toodle Pipskie (is that how you spell it?)
B000002MM8|5.0|There are a few artists today that you can plug in to and fully appreciate a composer's marriage of lyrics against musical arrangements.  Tori gets it, Trent Reznor will bathe you in it and Chris Martin is the most authentic about what it all means.  Yet Dead Can Dance is the most creative and risky, with it's unpredictable presentation and delivery.  It does not stick to one predictive rhythm or precussion beat; it takes risks with different languages, draws passage from hymnals and reinassiance literature and retells it or adds a musical arrangement that is unyielding and unapologetic with the antagonist and protagonist in their story telling and conclusions in their music.  \\"Into the Labyrinth\\" and \\"The Spirit Chaser\\" are must haves for any Dead Can Dance fan.   <br /> <br />For those that are not familiar with DCD, doing a search for them, you will find reviews under \\"goth\\" \\"metal\\" \\"new word\\" \\"Neochristian\\" \\"alternative.\\"  The reasoning is that defining their music is indicative of the title of their second track \\"ubiquitous\\" (ala \\"The Ubiquitous Mr. Lovegrove\\").  I first became acquainted with Dead Can Dance when a boyfriend played it for me, when I wanted a backdrop to camoflague any noise that a roommate might hear upstairs.  \\"The ubitquitous mr. lovegrove\\" was the selection he selected.  I got lost in the sound of it, and it wasn't until later that giving it another listen, that I understand the double-entrende in it and forshadowed the end of our relationship.  Yet in that moment, I kind of got lost with it.  The sound is intense and it ushers georgian chants (reminiscent of Benectdine monks) against an oboe, strings and percussion drum arrangements while Brendan talks about getting deceived and confronting his truths against lingering residual regret. <br /> <br />\\"I thought that you knew it all\\" <br />\\"I'd see all the signs before\\"   <br />\\"I thought that you were the one\\"  <br />\\"In darkness my heart was won\\" <br /> <br />and later an anti-climatic  <br/>\\"now I'm serving time in disillusionment\\"  <br />\\"keeping time to the beat of an old slave drum\\" <br /> <br />The genius of the last line is that Brendan adds a drum arrangement with a lash to it reinforces the feeling of entrapment and enslaved. The next track is Lisa Gerrard's accapella take of an irish hym \\"The Wind that shakes the barley.\\"  Her voice is so rich and tells a tale of morning love lost in war.   <br /> <br />Play that against track 7, a persion love song \\"Towards the within\\" and the chants that express deep regret of something lost that translate in to a warning about remaining fenced in at the sound of calavalry and the message is clear about squandering a win at the expense of love lost.   <br /> <br />I have 3 copies of \\"Into the Labyrinth\\" for home, car, and work.  Every time  I listen to it, I find something that I missed, be it a note or a line, or an instrument that is subtly blended in against the melody.  If you don't have \\"In to the Labyrinth\\" or \\"SpiritChaser\\" in your DCD inventory - get it.  It's an example of Brendan's intricate play on words, like the \\"sonambulistic\\" conclusion he draws about the pursuit of American dreaming, a sleepwalk in the dark.  There is a reason that Adrian Lyne worked in \\"Devorzhum\\" in to the montage of his movie \\"Unfaithful\\" and the conflict that Diane Lane's character is suffering after her betrayal and leaps right in to her remorse and she recants what she has just done.  <br /> <br />Play \\"Into the Labyrinth\\" and then give \\"SpiritChaser\\" a chance, and see if you don't catch yourself replaying it again on a Sunday afternoon, perhaps sharing with someone with whom you are intimate.   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0316548189|5.0|I read this book with consistent pleasure and mounting respect. My gravest concern, now, is that this great man, Mandela, who is very aged, may soon pass away. What wisdom and compassion and commitment will pass away with him! This is a fine book about a great man of our times and I strongly endorse it to all readers.
B00006CXSS|5.0|After seeing a couple of episodes on the History Channel I purchased the box set and loved it.  Great Story well told and well produced.  I got my box set on e-bay for $22 though.  No special features but all the episodes.
B000002BPS|4.0|Ixnay on the Hombre, The Offspring's 1997 release, found the band at a crossroads in more ways than one. For one, the band faced the monumental task of following up one of the most successful and influential rock albums of the 90's, Smash. They also had to prove to their fanbase that their controversial jump from Epitaph to Columbia wouldn't commercialize their edgy, heavy punk attack. The group somewhat fulfilled the latter - those searching for a sellout on Ixnay will be hard-presssed to find one. But as to the former, The Offspring were unable to recapture the magic that had propelled Smash into the Top 5. After a listen through Ixnay, it's not hard to tell why - not only are there no bona-fide classics in here like Self Esteem or Come Out and Play (although All I Want comes close), the quartet's sound had become less accessible when compared to their Smash days. On the whole, this album is a dark, heavy affair, a far cry from the raucus, carefree tracks of previous Offspring releases. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, as tracks like Gone Away and Amazed work very well, but it does make Ixnay hard to get through in one listen. Subsequently, sales for the album fell far short of expectations, and many were ready to write the group off as a flash-in-the-pan past their prime. But as the band's next record proved, they were willing to mix things up a bit in order to keep their careers afloat, even if it meant alienating some of their fans in the process... <br /> <br />Now onto Ixnay's tracks:  <br /> <br />Disclaimer - the requesite introduction to an Offspring album, this is just a short, sarcastic spiel warning parents of the dangers of a free-thinking society. Nothing special. <br /> <br />Meaning of Life - a good way to kick things off. Fast and heavy, with good hollering vocals from Dexter. <br /> <br />Mota - A funny, likable track about a guy addicted to pot. The lyrics are catchy, as are the guitar riffs, and the cry of \\"Mota!\\" after the chorus helps keepsthings going. <br /> <br />Me & My Old Lady - A weird, slightly perverted song with Egyptian-sounding guitars and vocals. Tolerable, but can grow annoying after a while. <br /> <br />Cool to Hate - Fast, mindless fun. Catchy guitar riffs, angry lyrics, and a great bridge. <br /> <br />Leave it Behind - For some reason, I've always liked this short, dark, heavy song. I love the chorus, and the metal-sounding guitars crackle with energy. <br /> <br />Gone Away - A truly touching song. Slow, heartfelt, and emotional, with haunting guitar and vocals. <br /> <br />I Choose - The poppiest song on the album. Part of me thinks it's lame, but then again I can't help bobbing my head along to the catchy verses. <br /> <br />Intermission - Pointless filler, but slightly funny (and disturbing). <br /> <br />All I Want - Awesome. Energetic, punky, and catchy, with instantly memorable chorus and great guitars. <br /> <br />Way Down The Line - Another pop-rock song. I like the main guitar riff and chorus on this one. <br /> <br />Don't Pick It Up - The humor misses badly in this lame, forgettable track. <br /> <br />Amazed - A good, raw, hard rock song with wailing guitars. <br /> <br />Change The World - Good drum intro leads to a fast, catchy, energetic song. A good way to wrap things up...but wait a few minutes after the song ends for a hilarious hidden message.
B00008EY65|4.0|I am not a comic book kind of guy and typically do not get into films of this genre, however Hellboy was quite a surpise.  Perlman is excellent in the titular role and the suppoting cast is strong throughout.  What really won me over though was the non-stop action and amazing FX.  They were some of the \\"cleanest\\" looking FX I have seen in quite some time (one major fight scene excluded).  ALso it is beautifully filmed - you could tell the director really took care with this project.  Highly entertaining and never dull - a great escapist movie.
B000002UAX|5.0|Probably one of the most important albums ever. It works so well collectively as a single piece of art. It still continues to define music of MANY genres. This album touches on so many emotions. Buy it, whatever your taste in music is. JUST DO IT.
B000244EMO|3.0|The items on this special edition were released in foreign markets TWO YEARS AGO.  That would not be bad except the transfer is also the same and not a very good one at that.  Grainy is the order of the day.  In high density color  scenes shot from the Predator's point of view, it's really tough to discern shapes.  The base  transfer Fox has used for this release (same as the previous DVD) is just middling. It's  not awful. But if you are buying this in hopes of a restored cleaned-up version of your favorite action film, minus all the dirt and grain, you're going to have to wait.  This seems to be how Fox double-dips  their customers, as with the non-anomorphic  transfers on the \\"Planet of the Apes\\" set.
B00008DDSC|5.0|As a feminist, the themes presented in this film were not my cup of tea...so I feel kind of awkward and embarrassed saying that I really enjoyed SECRETARY. I won't go into detail about plot and such, because it has all been said in previous reviews, but I will share some of my personal opinions.  <br /> <br />This movie is very disturbing, but the two leading players are fascinating to watch. I am a huge fan of James Spader, and he just shines in these kind of \\"twisted\\" roles. He is definitely one of the world's greatest actors and this is one of his best performances. (Even though all of his performances are top-notch)! And Maggie Gyllenhaal is absolutely fantastic as well! She is obviously a very talented actress with a lot of guts. I give her a lot of credit for taking a role that many women wouldn't touch. The only real qualm I have with this film is that it could have gone into a little more detail about Mr. Grey's past and why he behaves the way he does. It didn't provide enough information about his character's previous exploits.  <br /> <br />Another thing about this film that makes it unique is the way that it is able to be flat-out sexy without a lot of actual sex. The tensions between the two characters are so complex and I was always wondering what they would be feeling (and doing!) next. Seriously, the sexual tension in several of the scenes is so thick that you can cut it with a knife (this is especially true with the spanking scene). And you just gotta love those red Sharpies! Also, the musical score is terrific and highly seductive.  <br /> <br />Overall, this is a great film and it was interesting to see a different kind of love lifestyle (although it is one that I would never pursue myself)! The ending is touching and it was good to see how these two people finally came together and shared some gentle, caring and tender moments. I am not a big fan of nudity in movies, but the scenes in this film were done in an artistic, respectful and beautiful way.  <br /> <br />I have watched this movie several times already, but nothing compares to the experience of seeing it for the very first time. Initially, I found this film to be shocking and even mildly disgusting. After thinking about it for a little while, however, I grew to realize what a fine independent picture SECRETARY is...and now I love it! I highly recommend this film, but not for individuals who are closed-minded about this kind of subject matter. For mature, open-minded viewers, this movie is a must! <br />
B0001Z363W|4.0|\\"Hangover Music\\", the sixth offering from Zakk Wylde's Black Label Society, shows the guitar hero getting back to the basics which made his solo album's \\"Pride & Glory\\" and \\"Book of Shadows\\" so great.  Just about every song featured here is purposely slow tuned and loaded with soul, from the opening \\"Crazy or High\\", \\"Queen of Sorrow\\", \\"House of Doom\\", \\"Damage is Done\\", and the touching \\"Layne\\" which is a fitting tribute to late Alice in Chains frontman Layne Staley, and a much more heartfelt tribute than a song of the same title done by the supremely overrated Staind.  Zakk's guitar talents are as amazing as ever, and his voice sounds better than it ever has.  The only problem with \\"Hangover Music\\" is that people expecting the same kind of BLS brand music from earlier albums like \\"Blessed Hellride\\", \\"1919 Eternal\\", \\"Stronger Than Death\\", and \\"Sonic Brew\\" will be in for a bit of a surprise when they hear this whole album, but longtime fans of Zakk will appreciate the musicianship and diversity found here.  All in all, this is yet another solid album from Zakk, and I anxiously await any new material to come from him.
B00004X01U|4.0|It seems like Americans always want the same formulas over and over again. This is evident in the food they eat and the movies they watch. The same could be said for their music. They feel safe and comfortable with the familiar. On the contrary, Madonna emerges as an artist that refuses to limit herself to formulas;lately she relies on taking chances and exploring new musical territory and for an artist who has been around as long as she has,this is rather \\"ballsy\\". In the scheme of her long career she began to explore electronic music on Bedtime Stories,collaborating with the likes of Nellie Hooper and Marius Devries. She truly emerged as a serious artist and songwriter on Ray of Light. Her decision to collaborate with producer William Orbit was brilliant.Orbit is basically an electronic music pioneer and genious and together they created one of the best albums of the past decade.  <br /> Here, on MUSIC, she once again redefines herself as she always has, but now the reinventions are more about the music and what she can do to create a new sound rather than reinventing her exterior image.Of course she has a different look for this album but it only serves to convey the mood of the album. She builds on the sounds she created on Ray of Light and she taps into a new sound of French Electro-Pop, presented here by dj/producer MIRWAIS and which was all of the rage in Europe when this album hit. Unfortunately, most Americans wouldn't know that because our radio stations are inundated with tired hip-hop and revolting Disney Channel pop. <br /> Madonna sings a fantastic song \\"Paradise(not for me)\\" in half   english and french, how often do we hear an American TOP 40 artist sing in a different language. MUSIC has some amazing songwriting, \\" I Deserve It\\" sounds like something Joni Mitchell could have written and \\"What it feels like for a girl\\" is just really brilliant.  <br /> I think Madonna has inadvertently stigmatized herself as the \\"Material Girl\\",and she knows this. This is why she has endeavored to create a different kind of music. Some of her fans hate it and some of them love it. People who listen to a lot of house and electronic music dig this new material more than her old  eighties fans. I for one have always been a fan and my musical tastes have grown and changed just as Madonna's tastes have changed. She is still a relavent and viable artist regardless of how critics and fans attempt to stigmatize her and pan her work. However, she has been around so long that she can do and say whatever she wants and she can make whatever kind of album she chooses. This is certainly a luxury in today's stale musical climate and I for one enjoy every impressive instant.  <br />

B00005JN2X|4.0|\\"Hey Max..., A guy gets on the MTA here in L.A. and dies. Think anyone will notice?\\"  - Vincent's time runs out in \\"Collateral\\"<br /><br />From Michael Mann, the director of \\"Heat\\" and the creator of \\"Miami Vice\\" (when the hell is that series coming to DVD?!), comes \\"Collateral\\", a taut, suspenseful crime drama that is one of the best films of the summer of 2004, and has outstanding performances from both Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx (this isn't your mom's Tom Cruise!).<br /><br />Tom Cruise is Vincent, a cold-blooded hitman who has just arrived in L.A., with 10 hrs. to kill.<br /><br />Jamie Foxx is Max, an L.A. cabdriver who works the night shift for the past 12 years in hopes of one day fulfilling his dream of owning his own island cab company.<br /><br />After Max hooks up with an attractive D.A. (potrayed Jada Pinkett Smith) & getting her phone number, he meets his next customer, Vincent, and Max's hellish nightmare begins.<br /><br />Vincent offers six hundred bucks to Max, in return for taking him around the Los Angeles area to meet some friends that Vincent has to see. Max soon finds out, the hard way, that Vincent is a hired assasin, & not only in town with time to kill, but, the friends he mentioned are federal witnesses, to a high profile case, that Vincent must, one-by-one like the Grim Reaper, assasinate. The plot thickens when Max finds out the D.A., he met earlier in the evening, is on Vincent's list.<br /><br />With the police and the F.B.I. hot on the trail, & the clock ticking down to the early morning dawn, Max is forced to find a way to stop Vincent, save the girl, and not become public enemy number one in the eyes of the cops & the feds. Time is not on Max's side.<br /><br />What makes the film tick is the great performances from the two principles.<br /><br />Cruise gives one of his best performances of late and I have a feeling that if the Academy remembers \\"Collateral\\", Cruise might garner another Oscar nomination. Cruise's Vincent is one mean mother f**k in this film and comes across cool, calculative, cynical, and cocky. All the elements found in a great villian.

B00024BHTC|4.0|This album is really amazing, the worrk that must've gone into the production and arrangements of the symphony orchestra and choir is immense. This fits into metal just as well as it would in someones opera collection. Gets a 4 cuz track 2 is really korny!! The rest is brilliant.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|This set will be cool.I alway's wanted to see the European version.I guess the comic book comes with this set,that will be nice to have too.I did like the remake,but not as much as the orginal.The Monroville mall was much better then the one they used in the remake.And what was up with those stores in the remake?!That was an odd mall in the remake.The Mall in the orginal film was more like the mall's I go to.Well I will get this set.But how miny more times do I need to buy this movie?I have the old Thorn EMI video.I have 2 Directors cut of this movie on Laserdisc,1 CAV,1 CLV,and The Divimax DVD.And I guess a few years down the road when HD DVD comes out Anchor Bay will do an HD Dawn of The Dead.That would be a cool thing to see Dawn in HD!I heard George is making another Dead film \\"Land of the Dead\\" I guess there's a city that's ignoring the problem,and I think the survivors in the movie has put a wall around the city to keep the Zombies from coming into the city.Well that's what I heard about the new movie.If you ask me I think he should bring Peter and Fran back?I alway wonder what became of them after they flew away at the end of Dawn?
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I was NEVER a britney spears fan. I didn't buy one single album of hers...until now. The first time I heard \\"Me Against the Music\\", I had to buy it! I gotta say I love it! Here's a review of all the songs: <br /> <br />1. Me Against the Music (10/10) Very catchy, fun song to dance to. This was her first single off. <br /> <br />2. (I Got That) Boom Boom (9/10) Very r&b/hip-hop type song. Very fun. Not my favorite, but I still like it. <br /> <br />3. Showdown (8/10) Very sexual song. It's an ok song. <br /> <br />4. Breathe On Me (10/10) Really cool dance-orientated song. I thought this should have been her 4th single instead of Outrageous. <br /> <br />5. Early Mornin' (7/10) Techno-party song. It was produced by Moby. Not my favorite. <br /> <br />6. Toxic (10/10) Cool, pop song. It also has strings. Cool song. This was her 2nd single. <br /> <br />7. Outrageous (9/10) Middle-eastern r&b sound. Really good, but not great. This is her newest single. <br /> <br />8. Touch of my Hand (10/10) VERY sexual song, but very very cool. Another dance-orientated song. <br /> <br />9. The Hook-Up (9/10) Cool, catchy reggae-sounding song.  <br /> <br />10. Shadow (10/10) Her first ballad on the album. Really cool song. I kinda like Everytime better though. <br /> <br />11. Brave New Girl (9/10) A more pop-sounding song then the rest. It's one of my least favorites, but I still like it. <br /> <br />12. Everytime (10/10) Her 2nd ballad. I like this better then Shadow, but Shadow is still cool. This was her 3rd single. <br /> <br />13. Me Against the Music (Remix) (9/10) This is a cool dance song. I like the original better though. <br /> <br />(120/130) <br />All in all, I do recommend this album.
B00003CXC7|5.0|I like Hitchcock's \\"claustrophobic\\" thrillers like this...LIFEBOAT and ROPE.  Everything comes together perfectly in this classic film--and the bonus features do an admirable job of paying tribute to those contributions.  Jimmy Stewart is at his \\"everyman\\" best...Grace Kelly at her most gorgeous...Thelma Ritter at her wittiest (there is a special place in Heaven for her and Eve Arden---it must be SRO!).<br /><br />No film fan can be excused for not having this one in their collection!
B000089RVX|5.0|First of all, Evanescence was formed in the early 90's, around the same time as Lacuna Coil, Nightwish and almost all other female fronted bands. So calling them rip-offs is untrue, seeing as they formed around the EXACT SAME TIME. I love Evanescence. They are a cool band. I also love Nightwish, Lacuna Coil, The Gathering, and Sirenia, YET I still listen to Evanescence. This is a great CD, so do NOT listen to critics.
B0002234LS|3.0|This opinion is based strictly on viewing the movie, not the bonus features of the DVD.  It's one of the few Johnny Depp DVDs I don't plan on adding to my collection as, in spite of his frighteningly good performance, it's really mediocre fare.  I kept waiting for a golden toned alto voice to inform me that I was watching, \\"Lifetime: Television for Women.\\"<br /><br />Depp is so consistently good, it would be easy to take him for granted...but that's what makes him great.  He even rises above this mundane \\"Night Gallery\\" episode to make it a fun 97 minutes.  The talented supporting cast is largely wasted and most of the way you wonder if you're not watching a sequel to \\"Misery.\\"<br /><br />I can't imagine the bonus features are special enough to make this one to own.  It's strictly for Depp and/or Stephen King fans and those rainy Saturday afternoons when you're curled up wanting some minor goosebumps.
B00005QDW1|5.0|So many people bad mouth this album of No Doubt's. And for the life of me, I don't understand why. The sound of this one is very different from the rest, I'll give you that much, but that doesn't make it bad. Return of Saturn was also very different from Tragic Kingdom, and that's a great album too. People don't give enough credit to this album. It still has the ska sound, just with a little more rock. And if you are a true No Doubt fan, you would like this album just as much as the rest.<br /><br />If you like this album, try No Doubt's other albums Beacon Street Collection, Tragic Kingdom, Return of Saturn, and their self titled debut. Also try out the band Save Ferris.
0783225849|5.0|There's little new information to be gathered from any of the Special Features on this \\"Collector's Edition,\\" nonetheless you must own this excellent copy of PSYCHO if you're a serious film fan.<br /><br />Hitchcock and Anthony Perkins are both splendid in their roles as Director and Star---tho' there's little resemblance between the story of Norman Bates and the terrifying true tale of Ed Gein, on whom the original novel PSYCHO was based.<br /><br />Janet Leigh is great, even if in the Special Features interviews she seems to be auditioning for the next sequel.  She deserves credit, though, for having the strangest resume of Hollywood stars.... I mean--to have the same actress in PSYCHO, THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE and BYE BYE BIRDIE!?!!  Bizarre!  That should wreak havoc on anyone's \\"Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon.\\"
0316666343|3.0|I couldn't put this book down, and when I did, I couldn't wait to pick it up again. It was so moving and well-conceived. And then it fell apart. The last 50 pages seemed a cop-out, like the author just ran out of steam. There was no pay-off, which, although not strictly necessary, would have been one good way to end the story. **Negligible Spoiler Alert** My main problem was that I couldn't believe that, after everything we learned about her, the main character would behave the way she did in the end. It made no sense, and was actually infuriating. Maybe the author's point was that people are irrational or something. But I thought the end didn't fit the rest of this well-crafted, emotionally wrenching book. I would probably have given the book 5 stars if the ending had been even mediocre.
B00004TDTO|5.0|Nearly perfect movie, preserved to perfection on DVD for your collection!  The bonus features have some nifty moments, altho' no great revelations for afficiandoes.<br /><br />Definitely a must-own for film buffs; like you need an excuse to watch it again!<br /><br />My only regret is that there is no commentary track...  I can't believe with all this film gave to those involved that they didn't want to contribute more to the DVD than release the usual EPK interviews.  Too bad!
B00001U0DP|5.0|Over the years I have accummulated approximately 2000 books and films about the Holocaust.  I'd thought that the stories featuring people whose lives continued to have purpose in the NAZA camps had covered every possibility, assuming that such a life was ever possible amid those horrors. <br />  <br />However, until I saw the film earlier today on TV, I'd never before heard of \\"Life Is Beautiful\\".  The story of Guido is brilliantly unique among the scores of Holocaust dramas.  Strangely, the impacts \\"Life is Beautiful\\" had on me were two, and diametrically opposite:  This story is exquisitely beautiful; uplifting and funny.  But this story broke my heart. <br /> <br />The world could not survive for a day without people like Guido, and he is also the kind of person the world can never have too many of.  I think that he is able to maintain his child's innocense because he himself never loses his own.  When something funny happens it is only because Guildo still has his sense of humor.  Would that everyone of us could know the love of such a father.  But if that were the case, there would never have been such a story. <br /> <br />
6304578458|3.0|The main feature of this movie--depending on your point of view--is John Cusack, who looks like he's having a lot of fun in a quirky story quirkily done.  Fans will probably find his portrayal of a whimsical professional hit man a nice departure for the accomplished and sensitive actor.<br /><br />I would too except I just couldn't get over the disconnect between the sweet personality and the amoral nature of his character.  Of course this is a comedy, indeed a satire and burlesque of hit man films with shootouts (two guns ablazing) and car chases aplenty.<br /><br />There is also a romance between ex-highschool sweethearts Martin Q. Blank (Cusack) and Debi Newberry (Minnie Driver), and they seem nicely paired.  The story is framed around Blank's disappearance on prom night ten years previous and his sudden and unexpected return on the eve of his ten-year class reunion at Grosse Pointe (Michigan) High School.  His \\"profession\\" is so unlikely that he can be candid about it and nobody will believe him.  \\"I'm a professional killer.\\"  \\"Nice.  I'm glad that's working out for you.\\" (Okay, I made up that dialogue, but it's close to what's really said.)<br /><br />Dan Aykroyd gives comedic support in an over-the-top portrayal of a rival hit man always making with the jokes even as the bullets fly.  Funny too with a lot of original shtick is John Cusack's sister, Joan Cusack, as the hit man's strange but conscientious secretary, Marcella.  Alan Arkin has a modest part as Dr. Oatman, Blank's frightened shrink--frightened because he knows what Blank does for a living.<br /><br />Bottom line: a bonafide cult classic with repeat viewing appeal that may not work for all audiences.
B000002LGQ|5.0|Is this Madonna's best album?  I certainly think so.  It shows a lot of growth from her previous albums.  It's tempting to look at many of the songs here as being very personal ones that relate to her life.  Is \\"Till Death Do Us Part\\" about her marriage to Sean Penn?  Is \\"Promise to Try\\" about the death of her mother?  Is \\"Oh, Father\\" about her own father?  Is \\"Keep It Together\\" about her relationships with her siblings?  Perhaps, but you shouldn't assume that to be a fact.  One thing that I do know for a fact is that there are a lot of great songs here.  This is late '80s pop music at it's best.  Highly recommended.
B0000CCZ34|5.0|The first of the discs of this 'Greatest Hits' for the Pet Shop Boys contains 17 tracks (Pop), and  the second 18 tracks (Art).  For those who are die-hard fans of the Pet Shop Boys, this is a must have, but, for the most part, those fans will find it is in many ways an already-have. The tracks are remastered, but given the high production qualities of most PSB discs generally, there isn't a great deal to be gained from this. There are two new songs, Miracles and Flamboyant (one on each disc), which are both wonderful (and, interestingly, the addition of two songs to the 'greatest hits' compilation matches their performance with Discography, which also had a 'best of' with two new tracks added).<br /><br />There are the major songs and single releases from all previous albums, so this serves both as a retrospective but also as a handy all-in-one collection spanning the history of the Pet Shop Boys; from that perspective, if you were to have just one CD from them, this would the one. The songs are not in chronological release order (as Discography was), but rather seem almost randomly arranged; all songs but one from Discography are here, with an additional collection of tracks from the later album releases that reached the UK top 20. The division between 'Pop' and 'Art' is subtle, and any lifelong fan will have his or her own impressions as to which songs should fit into which category. The 'Pop' side is more disco/dance music, whereas the 'Art' side is a little more sombre, and the lyrics a little more complex. On the other hand, some songs, such as 'Love comes quickly' would easily qualify for either designation.<br /><br />This collection represents more than 20 years work on the part of Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe. For the first several years of that career, they were famous world-wide, and quite a staple in the dance clubs and video programming in America and elsewhere. The first singles collection 'Discography' represented the beginning of the decline of 80s style dance music in America, but the music descended from this type remained strongly popular throughout the rest of the world, as the sold-out concert tours of the Pet Shop Boys everywhere except North America attests to. Many of the songs on this 'Pop-Art' collection will therefore be new to audiences whose interest in the Pet Shop Boys ended the hits from the 'Behaviour' era.<br /><br />A must-have for anyone who likes dance music, disco, electronic music, 80s music, the Pet Shop Boys, or who wants to have a complete music collection.c in America, but the music descended from this type remained strongly popular throughout the rest of the world, as the sold-out concert tours of the Pet Shop Boys everywhere except North America attests to.

B000244EMO|4.0|everything about this new edition is good except again they did not upgrade the pic to HD. So SAD!
B0002234LS|3.0|This movie is basically exactly the same as psycho 2 and 3 but not as violent and brutal. The main character is just like Norman Bates (with multiple personality syndrome) even though the plot has been duplicated from other movies i still think it wasnt all that bad mainly because of the good acting. Got disturbing at times.
B0001ADAVK|5.0|overall, this was a good movie.  Many times the liberals try to convince us to think outside the box, and be \\"free.\\"  Well, Julia Stiles said she wanted to be a stay at home mom, and K Watson couldn't accept it.  She \\"practically wrote\\" Julia's application to Yale Law, where Julia was accepted.  K Watson said she thought Julia would regret not going to law school.  Well how many of us have gone to law school?  Did you know that both men and women are leaving the profession in droves?  Why would anyone regret not going to law school? <br /> <br />Ok assuming she would, what's wrong with staying at home? <br /> <br />Also, did you notice how K Watson went to bed with a professor who openly sleeps with his students?  Yuck.
B0001I562I|5.0|While meeting his brother in the woods in 1978, David Freeman falls down a ravine.  He gets up to discover that it's suddenly 1986.  Where has he been for the last 8 years?  Meanwhile, NASA has found a space ship.  Is there a connection?  Can they find a way into the ship?  And who keeps calling David inside his mind?<br /><br />I loved this movie as a kid.  While the first part seems slow and rather obvious if you've heard of the premise, the second part is a fun ride.  Once David meets up with Max, things pick up and the movie switch from mystery to comedy.  Watching it today, I was impressed by the special effects.  This movie is almost 20 years old and they still hold up very well.<br /><br />This is basically a movie only DVD release.  The film is presented in wide screen and surround sound.  But for the price, you're getting a great deal.<br /><br />While not great cinema, this is a movie that the entire family will have fun watching together.  Get it today and enjoy.
B0001Z52RU|1.0|It's funny how publicity can play such an important role in how a film, or actor, is received. For example, films like \\"Swept Away\\" or \\"Gigli\\" are crucified in the press, partially because they are, in fact, mediocre or poor films, but mostly because of the overexposure or perceived arrogance of their stars. But a film like \\"The Butterfly Effect\\", which is equally as bad (if not worse) isn't nearly as maligned, probably because of the \\"golden boy\\" status of star Ashton Kutcher.<br /><br />This film is just a mess. The premise is ridiculous. The script is full of holes. The performances range from okay to awful. (Watching the film you feel truly embarrassed for the talented actors, such as Eric Stoltz, that degrade themselves by appearing in this schlock). Ashton Kutcher's manic goofiness works on \\"That 70's Show\\", but while trying to carry a sci-fi/drama film, he appears downright wooden.<br /><br />The only way this film works is as a guilty pleasure. I can't deny that it was almost worth watching once, just to laugh at how ludicrous it all is. Boo!
B000062YAZ|5.0|I bought this cd expecting the best and it definitly delivered. No dissapointments here. Definitly one of the most hardcore heavy metal albums of all time.
B00005V3Z4|4.0|It's not immediately obvious what kind of movie this is, I'm still working on it. Part satirical social commentary, part psychological thriller, part time travel sci-fi movie, and part horror flick; like David Lynch masterpieces, it probably requires several viewings to uncover the many rich layers.<br /><br />But that's the genre-defying beauty of Donnie Darko. It springs effortlessly across themes to create a gorgeously ominous atmosphere. The screenplay flirts with perceptions to inspire a dreamy curiosity without actually explaining the twisted universe of time travel that drives a teenager to the film’s startling climax.<br /><br />Sure, like any other work of art, it has its issues. There are bits that are simply impossible to make sense of. For instance, a scene with a couple of men and Drew Barrymore, where they abruptly say \\"Donnie Darko\\" and then giggle. What was that about?<br /><br />One could also say that the movie trips a little in the last quarter by tossing some random stylish punches in an effort to keep the audience interested. The result is somewhat confusing if not inconsistent. Who was Frank really? We are led to believe that he was a figment of imagination, but as it turns out, he was a real character. I am still trying to work this one out.<br /><br />Regardless, whatever it is, whatever it resolves to and \\"means\\", I highly recommend this mosaic for its dynamics rather than its \\"story\\". How many movies can successfully pull off a six-foot bunny as a creepy character! One only wishes more directors would take delightful gambles like this.
B0001ZX0PG|1.0|This film was a walk out for me.  A wife with no faith in her husband, nor to mention any understanding of him (Dave). The ego driven \\"might makes right\\" Jimmy. He's so full of rage and malice that it's hard to empathize with him over his daughters death. These two characters are shameful, and an example of human disintegration. That Dave is made the scapegoat of this film, is particularly vile. I was in Dave's shoes, throwing up, knowing that i was about to die, and pleading with Jimmy...but Mr. \\"vengeance is mine\\" has his way and put's away, as someone posted so eloquently, \\"someone who would have eventually committed a crime anyway\\"...Yes Mr. Eastwood, let's just throw that life away, put the dysfunctional out of their misery, who cares. I did'nt see the ending, nor do i intend to. No ending could possibly justify this \\"retribution gone wrong\\" mess. The acting, i admit, is superb, but there is nothing positive to take from this film, no hope. In the end, Jimmy trades one pain for another, or did he ever really have much love for Dave. See it at you own risk
B00005QIPH|5.0|I had always been interested in the Strokes because of the hype, obviously. I had listened to clips many times and now finally bought the album. I liked it immediately, though at first thought they needed more variety, because on the first few casual listenings the songs all sound very similar. It's really one of those albums that you have to put on your headphones and totally immerse yourself in. Once you do that, you'll love it. Favorite songs are \\"Soma,\\" \\"Barely Legal,\\"and \\"Someday.\\" I hear that the dual guitarists really feed off of each other on their second album \\"Room on Fire.\\" I think this album lacks that but its still great.
B00004STUL|5.0|Wow!  These guys are tough.  I like the Martin Lawrence/Will Smith Combo.  The chemistry is good between them two and it shows in their performance.  Although I liked the movie I would not recommend it to small children.  But adults... especially if they like action movies... you gotta see it.
0380977788|3.0|I was anxious to read \\"Coraline\\" because I'd heard such great things about it, but I don't really understand what all the fuss is about.  The premise of the story is quite interesting: a young girl discovers a locked door in her home that leads to another apartment that is identical to her own, except for the fact that her \\"other\\" parents (with their creepy black button eyes) want to keep her with them forever, conforming her to their standards and never let her go.<br /><br />The concept of the two worlds is good, but the story resolves itself before we ever find out why the alternate world exists in the first place.  I think this book could have been longer and the author could have elaborated in a lot of areas.  As it is, the book starts off strong but leaves a lot to be desired when you reach the end.<br /><br />Also, the book is supposed to be for children ages eight and up.  If I read this book when I was eight, I would have had nightmares for weeks.  The creepy illustrations alone are enough to give any child nightmares.  If this is a book you're considering purchasing for your child, I strongly suggest that you read through it first to make sure your kid can handle it.
B0002IU988|5.0|I would first like to say that the moron who wrote the \\"I only gave it 5 stars to get attention, it should get 0 stars, duhrr, i'm a big stupid lame-o and I wear the same black goth shirt every day\\" should move away from the DC area, our collective IQs are now lower thanks to you. <br /> <br />For comparison to Creed cds, this cd matches the enjoyment I had for My Own Prison when I picked that up...I dunno, 7 years ago?  Yeah.  But for all cds, I'd say this betters the Velvet Revolver cd that was released a few months ago.  Much more intelligent riffs here anyway, and Tremonti's solos are incredible.  Those who claim the guitar work is lame should check their heads, because I think their brains may have fallen out from all that headbanging and moshing to the same metal riff over and over again. <br /> <br />If you like straight-up arena rock, this is definitely the best release of the year for you.  If you like death metal, you have no business even reading this review, because you don't even like this genre, so go away. <br /> <br />BURN IT DOWN! <br /> <br />
B0002I831S|5.0|I am a \\"Star Trek\\" fan from the '70s, and plan to purchase the seasons as they are released.  I too am glad that they have been packaged in seasons, and not \\"two episodes per DVD\\" as previously available.  I have a question, and I have no other format to ask: what does \\"Dubbed in English\\" mean?  The show was originally done in English, so this is somewhat confusing.  I will look for a response, or email me if you know.  Thanks . . .
B000000XB9|5.0|I listen to this CD on hot summer days as loud as i can in my car with the window's rolled down with all my thug buddies as we drive around town with backwards hats on. They have an element and spirit in their music that needs to be brought back to MY generation! It brings to mind a time and place i wasn't even born yet for. It's hippies and protesters rebelling against the vietnam war with signs, it's uncle sam pointing at YOU, it's strange marsupials and white trash living upstream from rich estate owners by the river with big wheels turning, it's New Orleans and Memphis and everything else slapped into one flow. My theory is that it's not real Rock'n'Roll unless they mention \\"New Orleans\\" somewhere in the song. <br />\\"As long as i can see the light\\" is one of my all time favorite songs.
B000068IEU|5.0|One of the best horror movies of the last 30 years.  This movie broke new ground and is not for the squemish.  This movie is like a punch in the guts that you will not forget; and a movie that I find it hard to watch because this movie takes you to the heart of brutality; after this movie you feel as though you've been assaulted.   <br />   I wish more of our contemporty horror films would dare to take audiences to the heart of darkness as courageously as Wes Craven.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|and I want to make it public. You know who this is, Religionandmedia. I love you! To death...
B000148KK2|4.0|I will admit that I had very mixed emotions about \\"The Girl in the Other Room\\". I fell in love with Diana Krall due in large part to the fact that she was so proficient at performing the standards, and this album is quite a departure from what I have known from her in the past.  As any good Diana fan would, I ran out and bought the CD the day it arrived in stores and gave it a listen. Admittedly it was not what I expected. Undaunted, I sat down and really listened. What I found was an artist revealing the vast changes that had taken place in her life personally, and her emerging talent as a composer and song writer.    Gone are the standards by Porter and Gershwin, and what has replaced them is an interesting mix of contemporary Jazz pieces and original compositions. The title track \\"The Girl in the Other Room\\", \\"Narrow Daylight,\\" \\"Abandoned Masquerade,\\" \\"I'm Coming Through\\" and \\"Departure Bay,\\" are all collaborations with her new husband singer and song writer Elvis Costello, and all deal with love and loss, both of which have influenced her greatly on this album as well as in her personal life. \\"Departure Bay\\" deals with the loss of her mother and the memories she has of her beloved hometown. The emotion and sorrow is clear and unmistakable and while the lyrics, co-written with her husband, may not always make sense to you and I, they clearly mean something to her. Which is very much the theme of this collection.  Other tracks include Mose Allison's \\"Stop This World\\", Tom Waits' \\"Temptation\\" a soft, smoky version of Costello's \\"Almost Blue\\" and an exceptional, upbeat, bluesy version of Bonnie Raitt's \\"Love me like a Man\\".     No matter who the author, Diana's ability to sell a lyric with her soft, sensual, whiskey-flavored voice is truly remarkable. Couple that with her effortlessly swinging piano, and you have an album filled with wonderfully unique songs. After six albums of virtually nothing but standards, it stands to reason that a change in style and materialwould be forthcoming. I admire and respect her for taking a chance and mixing things up. Without a doubt this assembly of songs is a reflection of where she is as an artist and a person. Although this will never be my favorite Diana Krall album, as a fan I had to have it for my collection.
B000089CPF|5.0|I sat in my neighborhood bar one night, waiting for an ex-girlfriend who never showed, but it wasn't a total waste. The bartender was having trouble with the speakers in the bar, so I found myself paying particular attention to the tunes.     If you love or even like the crossover-(the border)-sounds of Los Lobos' best stuff, it's a good bet you'll be into this. There are 2 stunning tunes that should've gotten airplay (Quattro, and Not Even Stevie Nicks...) that you are SURE to like, and then there's plenty more on your plate, all riskier, but equally interesting, if not as Pop.     I highly recommend it. Now ... meeting old girlfriends for a catch-up beer? That I might advise against.
B00000DFRS|5.0|This is definately my favourite Whitney album; almost every song is great, but of course, there are some amazing/excellent moments. These include 'It's Not Right But It's Okay', 'When You Believe', 'I Learned From The Best' 'Oh Yes' and 'Until You Come Back'. If you were a fan of the singles, this collection is perfect. Also, this album is excellent as if is still the same amazing voice but also Whitney venturing (very successfully) into harder Rnb Hip-Hop territory. The album is worth the money just for 'Until You Come Back' and 'When You Believe', but every song is at least good, and at best well-written, original and very pleasant on the ears. Well done Whitney
B00020X88O|3.0|OK...first of all...I just can't give this film 5 stars, as much as I love it.  It's still just an awful film.   <br /> <br />Be that as it may, in the spirit of Rocky Horror, this is a bad film to be loved, cherished, and mocked incessantly!  As the BRILLIANT commentary track indicates...never in the history have film have so many made every possible wrong decision and had it all wind up in one place. (I'm totally paraphrasing that, but it is the gist).  The script is BAD, (Esterhause really needs to acquint himself with women, if for nothing more than to realize they talk about more than eating, nails, and being naked!) the acting (save Gina Gershon, who clearly is the only one who gets she's in a bad film and camps it up to her hearts delight!) is just wrong on so many levels, and the production numbers are just silly in their splendor. <br /> <br />Be that as it may, a film this bad deserves attention, because it does create an almost new art form.  Not so much in the spirit of WIlliam Hung, who realizes he's bad and doesn't care because he sings with heart...this film doesn't realize how bad it is, but you have to revel in the blindingly niave ardor which everyone throws themselves into this badness.   <br /> <br />The bonus materials are terrific...the pasty game comes complete with pasties and a blindfold for hours of fun with your friends.  If you go into this movie expecting a bad film with a mdguided heart, you can love it for what it is.  If you expect anything more, you are gonna be WAY disappointed. <br /> <br />Buy the VIP edition...because I tell ya...this is seriously money well spent on entertainment!
B00008OWZC|4.0|i especially like the live version of \\"Over the Hills and Far Away\\" which in many aspects is even better than the original version. However some songs lack the intensity of the original versions.
B000286RKW|5.0|First off, the reason I have the subject that I do is because, the current DVD that was released back in 98 doesn't allow you to watch the movie in one sitting. You have to get up and flip the DVD over! Bad move!<br /><br />With this edition, that's all gone. Plus, you now have commentary as well as a second DVD with various special features that will bring to light what it was like to make this movie.<br /><br />For those complaining that these mobsters were dumb, then you've watched WAY too many Godfather movies. I love the Godfather movies as well and I own the DVD collection of it. However, the Godfather is a Hollywood glamorized vision of the perfect mob life. Plus, that was during prohibition and Goodfellas takes place after the fact, when being in the mob definitely didn't pay.<br /><br />Goodfellas shows what it's really like to be connected to the mob. In fact, the mob has ALWAYS been ripping itself off. How else does it make money? Extortion can only go so far. So, it rips itself off from it's company fronts to collect on the insurance. It's pretty pathetic and shows that mob life is not glamorous.<br /><br />Eventually, you get guys in the family that get swelled heads and want to make it on their own. This leads to even MORE corruption within the family as well as mutiny.<br /><br />In this case, Henry Hill got greedy and started snorting his own stash. Being in the mob is NOT glamorous and this movie (and Henry Hill's life) is a perfect example of why NOT to get involved in organized (or really, DISorganized) crime. It's not glamorous, noone is happy, and everyone is out to ice the next fella. Nothing good about it and this movie throws it in your face with such grittiness that you begin to feel that you are part of the story. It draws you in, fascinates and disgusts you to the point that you realise that this IS how the mob really is and that it is NOT glamorous and noone wins in the end.<br /><br />All that money (or at least, what they can scrounge up) does not bring happiness and leads to nothing but failure and life ending in a meat grinder or worse.<br /><br />Excellent movie that sets the example for why mobs are not the way of life.<br /><br />As for the special features, the one I really liked the most was the feature that had the real Henry Hill in it. He talks about how it wasn't fun, even though back then, it felt like it was the best way to live. Straight from the real deal, you finally understand that the choices he made were his own and he takes complete responsibility for it. However, as much as the movie might make it seem like he enjoyed it, Henry comes out and states that in reality, he feared for his life every day. He saw how things played themselves out, especially with Tommy around. That was a wakeup call to Henry and he eventually cleaned himself up and got his life straight after going into the Witness Protection Program.<br /><br />The other features on the second DVD are excellent as well, going into the creative process of how Martin Scorsese sets up various angles to set the atmosphere. All in all, 4 excellent features that do nothing but help makes this the best realistic mobster DVD/movie of all time.but failure and life ending in a meat grinder or worse.

B000002KE2|3.0|Before I get into the \\"negatives\\" of \\"Vol. 4\\", I want to weigh in on one MAJOR positive.  This album has the BEST production of any Ozzy-era Black Sabbath album.  They would not do an album that SOUNDED this good again until \\"Heaven and Hell.\\"  This was the first album produced by Tony Iommi (credited to the band, but really Iommi) and also their first recorded outside the U.K.  The guitars are upfront (as they should be!), Bill Ward gets probably his best drum sound ever (despite having documented major trouble getting the \\"feel\\" of some of the songs, which almost caused his departure from the band), and Ozzy's voice, well...no comment.  The only complaint I would make on the production front is that Geezer Butler's bass is mixed too far down. <br /> <br />What is really amazing about this album being so good is that they were out of their heads on drugs (especially coke) during the recording.  Indeed, the album was to have been titled \\"Snowblind\\" but Warner Brothers wouldn't have it. <br /> <br />The songs are mostly good, with a couple approaching epic proportions. <br /> <br />\\"Wheels of Confusion/The Straightner\\": Starts out with bluesy Iommi melodic guitar lines, then goes into the trademarked Sabbath tempo and time changes that only they can do.  Excellent. <br /> <br />\\"Tomorrow's Dream\\": Shorter and snappier, indeed almost \\"hit single\\" material but still good and heavy. <br /> <br />\\"Changes\\": UGGGHHHH.  I know I'm in the minority on this among all those who worship anything Ozzy ever sneezed on but I absolutely HATE this song.  The experimentation is laudable (Tony on piano, Geezer on Mellotron) but Ozzy's monotone voice barely carries on Sabbath's heavy numbers and he's just not suited to singing a ballad (the same goes for \\"So Tired\\" on his \\"Bark At The Moon\\" album).  This album would get four stars from me if it didn't have this song. <br /> <br />\\"FX\\": A pointless stab at neo-Floydian bleeps and blurps.  I guess you had to be there and on drugs to \\"getit\\".  I was neither and I don't.  At least it doesn't last very long. <br /> <br />\\"Supernaut\\": PRIME SABBATH!  One of Tony's BEST guitar riffs and Geezer and Bill lock in as still the best rhythm section in heavy metal.  Ward really shines here, both in propelling the song and some very good drum fills. <br /> <br />\\"Snowblind\\": SNORT! Yes, that's what this is about.  A good song that Ozzy does sing well on, even if I don't care for the subject matter.  I think that keyboardist Gerald \\"Jezz\\" Woodroffe may be responsible for the synthesised strings in the outro underlying Tony's excellent solo. <br /> <br />\\"Cornucopia\\": Apparently this is one that Wardy had real trouble nailing down but I can't tell it because his drumming is very good.  This is one of Sabbath's almost-orchestral \\"epics\\". <br /> <br />\\"Laguna Sunrise\\": Nice Iommi acoustic interlude over Jezz Woodroffe's keyboards. <br /> <br />\\"St Vitus' Dance\\": Pop goes the Sabs!  Really, this is one of the poppiest numbers they've ever done.  Were they aiming for a hit single with this one?  Not my favourite. <br /> <br />\\"Under The Sun/Every Day Comes And Goes\\": The crushing powerchords opening this song really define the term \\"heavy metal\\".  This is another of the \\"epics\\" and almost symphonic in nature, with the song divided into \\"movements\\" by Ward's drum patterns (including overdubbed gongs!).  Ozzy sings Geezer's agnostic-orientated lyrics quite well (even though I don't care for the sentiments), but it's really the instrumentation that elevates this track.  Classic indeed. <br /> <br />This was the first Sabbath album where they started to sound less-than-unified (a trend that would continue throughout the remaining Ozzy years) but there's still much here well worth checking out.
B0000019PA|5.0|There are few albums that can truly be considered the cornerstones of a true \\"indie\\" collection.  Among them, classics such as \\"Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain\\",(perhaps \\"wowee zowee\\" if you are more in that vein of Pavement) \\"There's Nothing Wrongs with Love\\", and \\"This is a Long Drive for Someone with Nothing to Think About\\", but it has long been my oppinion and my test of the \\"true indie kids\\" to ask but one question.  One musical query that defines the true from the poser!  That is, \\"Do the words 'Nuetral Milk Hotel' mean andything to you?\\"  It's a simple question really, but one that carries alot of weight.  \\"In the Areoplane Over the Sea\\" defined entire years of my life.  Friendships have been forged based on this album.  Lifes are changed in this one! This album was the one, is the one, that will seperate all casual listeners from true fans!  It's the great dividing line, the ultimate judge, the sign of those who have given their ear fully away to the greatest movement to ever hit the rock world!!  Those on the outside may scoff at the forcefulness of my words, but those on the inside understand, this is one of those definative albums!!  Were I stranded on a desert isle with but a CD player and 5 of my favorites, this would, without question be among those select and precious few that make the cut! <br /> <br />In Short:  If you don't have this one, GET OUT!!! <br /> If you have it and it's not a part of you, stop claiming INDIE!
B00005A46T|5.0|all you people who dont think this album is that good, your all a bunch of (...).  maybe not every song is what you want it to sound like, but there all very good.  left behind if the best song on the album.  the video is realy cool.  just keep listening to it, if you have a brain, you will eventually grow on it.
0812550706|1.0|I had to read Ender's Game as a summer reading assignment for my 9th grade advanced english class, and after a month or so of reading it, I finally finished it. I was happy when I finished reading it. It was boring. The book was descriptive and I could picture in my head what was happening, but I couldn't really relate to any of the characters (except for Ender, maybe -- since I'm gifted, like he is).  <br />Also, I really didn't like the awfully odd names that the characters called each other -- farteater and scrunchface, to name a couple. What is up with that?  <br />To me, the only truly interesting part of Ender's Game was when Peter and Valentine were on the nets as Locke and Demosthenes. <br /> <br />Although there are tons of people that like and/or love this book, I'm certainly not one of them -- especially since I dreaded reading the book (and I normally love reading books).
B0001NBMBC|5.0|i think that this is the best slipknot album ever.  the songs all have a deep meaning to them which is cool.  its a realy heavy cd.  in my opion, its slightly lighter than the first 2, but its alot better. corey shows alot more talent on this record.  he proves that this album can be just as heavy asmthe others, but still meaningful like he did with stone sour. <br /> <br />and another thing, this album is slightly lighter, but the first two were very good.  and to everyone that says screaming is no talent, then your a freakin retard.  you try screaming for as long as corey does on the first two, you will lose your voice. you cant just expect to scream and make money.  screaming the way he does takes talent.  anyhoo,  i thought that this cd was extremely good. best album from slipknot yet.  <br />i also recommed the first 2, there very good as well.
B000002UAX|3.0|Alot of those people who rated this one star, can't appreciate music, and don't really give an album like this enough re-listens to let it grow on you. It doesn't suck, nor do the Beatles. The reason I gave this album 3 stars is because there's an awful lot of filler. YOu could take 2 or 3 songs from the 2nd disc, and keep the first disc, just to make it a single album. This isn't the Beatles' best effort, not there worst either. Any Beatle fan will end up with this album sooner, or later.        Revolution 9, isn't all that terrible. It isn't really a song, just a collage of strange noises. I like it, but I'm sure nobody else does.    And the guy who said \\"Where's Paint it Black?\\" that Rolling Stones. If you didn't know that,wow.
1594200106|5.0|This book is so hard to categorize except to simply say it's a beautifully well written story. It's a love story on so many levels, the first being the love of books and the power within them. A young boy, Daniel, is taken by his father to a magical place; The Cemetery of Forgotten Books. As is the tradition the boy can choose one book which will be his to take care of. He chooses a book called, 'The Shadow of the Wind' by a mysterious author named Julian Carax. The story and it's author become somewhat of an obsession for Daniel, and before long a hideously disfigured man is demanding it's return or suffer the consequences. Gothic, romantic, and full of surprises and intrigue, it's one of the best and most original I've read this year.
076790592X|5.0|This was one of the best books I have ever read. It was a very moving story, and I would reccomend it to anyone! And if you loved this book, you will also like \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven,\\" by Mitch Albom.
B00005JLEU|4.0|This movie is simply stunning. The art is gorgeous. The story is unlike anything you have come across. This movie is simply magical. I prefer it with the Japanese language track and the English subtitles.  <br /> <br />A word of advice--just because this is an animated movie does not mean it is for small children. There are some pretty scary scenes. Conversely-- just because this is an animated movie does not mean that it is not for adults. Older audiences are likely to appreciate this movie more.
0345410025|5.0|Most everyone's memory can be improved. I got this book years ago and used it in school, but also to remember matrix tables when I learned card counting in blackjack. Ken Uston in his book on same said perhaps only 1% of the population can learn the highest levels of card counting no matter how hard they study, and I stink at math but still wanted to be one of the 1%. The book helped me memorize the matrix tables and calculate multiplication of amounts in decimals, run the sums through one matrix table, make more calculations, recall the next matrix table, and so on. All numbers, no inherently suprising or interesting mnemonic \\"hooks\\" to make the process easier, but with Lorrayne's techniques I got quite a lot of seemingly random info down cold.  <br /> <br />Incidentally, I became quite good at the card game \\"concentration.\\" heheh <br /> <br />I also used this book's techniques to help my poker game.  Its applicability to poker specifically is in memorizing the odds, strategic concepts, and the cards dealt out. I made flashcards when learning 7-stud for both odds and strategic concepts using Lorrayne's techniques. Worked great. I also used the concepts to keep track of the cards that came out in 7-stud, where good card memory is very useful. I wasn't flawless at it, but quite often knew how many cards of every rank were dealt and how many were dealt of every suit.  I took $200 to the Southern California casinos and within a few months was a regular winner at the $10/20 tables, and quickly after that at the $15/30 tables. <br /> <br />Hint: things that are absurd, violent, comical, sexual, perhaps even unpalatable -- anything that paints a bright, striking, or even jarring picture -- are the associations that are easiest to remember. Be creative and colorful and make yourself laugh when making associations up to help you remember things!  No way anyone caught with my flashcards would ever be considered for parole.  <br />
B00005MP58|5.0|This DVD is simply great. Austen has created a work with so much character and so much subtle humor--it is wonderful to see all this captured on screen.  <br /> <br />Colin Firth is a wonderful Darcy. You can just see his brain working behind those eyes.  <br /> <br />When I was in 10th grade my english class read Pride and Predjudice. When we were done, we watched this adaptation. Everyone, even the 16-year-old boys, was enthralled. This is the best adaptation of any piece of literature that I have ever seen.  <br /> <br />A word of advice-- although this adaption is brilliant, it is really long. Only hardcore fans can absorb it in one sitting.
B00005JMXX|5.0|I thought this film was pretty good despite some of the reviews it was given.  I'm not a hugh fan of disaster films but the special effects in this movie was excellent. I will definately be adding this film to my DVD collection.
B00005JMJ4|3.0|This is one of those movies that people either really love or really hate. That's pretty obvious based on the mixed reviews here. In my case, I didn't think I'd like the film until I caught it on cable by chance one night and got hooked into a beautiful film that has become one of my favorites. That said, I have issues with the DVD. First of all, there are 5 minutes of forced advertisements at the beginning. They are not the type that you can skip by hitting the menu button; you've got to fast forward through them for a minute or two. The opening screen even instructs you to use the fast forward button if you don't want to see the trailers. What is this, VHS? Horrible. On top of that, there is no commentary track. If you're one of those people that really liked the film, naturally you'd like to know more with comments from at least the director and maybe the stars. This type of film almost warrants it (especially when you think of some of the scenes, like the whisper). I expected to hear Sofia giving us the inner workings/thoughts/fun facts about the film with a commentary track, and was disappointed when there wasn't one. There is a half-hour piece shot with a home video camera of Sofia and the crew running around Tokyo, along with a Rome 2003 interview with her and Bill Murray. There are deleted scenes which are pretty good, but that's about it.    In my opinion, this DVD would fall into the \\"acceptable\\" category if it were not for the horrible forced trailers. Once again, these forced ads are really horrible. If you've got a DVD player that can fast forward up to 48x and can get through them quick, it might not be too bad. If you've got an older model that can only fast forward 2x or 4x, you'll be sitting there for a couple minutes going through trailers before you get to the menu to play the film.... every time you want to watch it. If you turn off the movie to finish it later and your player does not remember the location of the disc where you left off, you'llhave to fast forward through the ads again to finish the viewing. It would not surprise me if some type of \\"Collectors Edition\\" DVD is released in the next year or two, without the ads, a director commentary track, and a lot more extras that this type of film deserves. With the double dipping that studios do these days (releasing a quick stripped down or acceptable disc, and then putting out a much better one later), it's almost a guarantee and I'll be first in line to grab it. Until then, I'd recommend this disc be rented at least once before making the choice to buy it or not.
B00006V9A0|5.0|Honestly, who doesn't love Nirvana? There's at least one song of theirs that you have to admit you love, even if it is Smell's Like Teen Spirit :P For those who are new to Nirvana, like me (although I know a lot about them through my brother), this is a great way to start off.<br /><br />One of the best things about this compilation is, none of the songs are bad, nor do they look out of place. They're all great songs in their own right, and I seriously doubt you'll be hitting the skip button on your walkman :D<br /><br />Smells Like Teen Spirit has been recognized as one of the greatest songs of all time, and if you've never heard it, you seriously have to pull your head out. More favourites like Come As You Are, Rape Me, and the fabulous Pennyroyal Tea made it on this compilation too.<br /><br />The fun Sliver always puts a stupid grin on my face, and I can never get enough of Dumb and In Bloom. The previously unreleased You Know Your Right was included to lure collectors into buying the cd (it's a great track, although I wouldn't say it warrants the purchase of the cd...)<br /><br />However, my favourite track on the record has to be the MTV Unplugged recording of All Apologys. It's certainly the slowest track of the bunch, but it's great! Nirvana's version of The Man Who Sold The World is actually superior to Bowie's original, it's a great listen!<br /><br />My only real complaint with the cd is Polly, one of Nirvana's best, not making the cd. But meh, not everyone can be pleased :)<br /><br />Well, basically what I'm trying to say is that this record is worth far more than it's weight in gold... if you're new to Nirvana. Those who have all the Nirvana albums might want to skip it. Also, try and pick up the cd that has Where Did You Sleep Last Night on it, it's a great way to close the collection :)
B00003CXCT|5.0|The greatest trilogy of all-time finally coming to DVD!!!  For all the people fussing that they want to have the movie as they originally saw it, got out and get yourself a 35mm film projector and a print of the film and some really bad late 1970's movie theater speakers.  The rest of us will enjoy the greatly enhanced digital picture (wasn't digital in the original release), 5.1 surround sound (wasn't released that way), with commentary tracks (never saw a movie in a theater that had one) and loads of extras!! <br /> <br />Take your old VHS tapes, project them onto a wall with a video projector in your 2-channel stereo sound and have fun!!!
B0002IU988|5.0|I had the chance to hear this record before it came out (thanks to VH1) and I couldn't wait to go out and buy it. No, this is not Creed II. The sound is different though it was expected to have the Creed sound. Highlight songs include \\"Broken Wings\\", \\"Metalingus,\\" and the carrier single \\"Open your Eyes\\".
B000286RZM|5.0|I fell in love with Shadows and I wasn't sure I could move on to another album, but Will to Death proved me wrong. It has a fresh, grainy quality that still maintains a brooding, dark mood. The lyrics are more lucid than Shadows, and I get the feeling they are really trying to say something. I highly recommend Will to Death to anyone who loved Shadows, or is a fan of the more melodic Chili Peppers music.
B0001KL5DA|5.0|It seems somehow fitting that, for a show whose central setting is a funeral home, the characters and storylines within it are brought more vividly to life than in most television dramas. \\"Six Feet Under\\" focuses on brothers Nate and David, running their family funeral business under the paranoid eye of their mother, Ruth. I wouldn't want to go into too much detail here about the various plotlines, but I watched the entire second season on DVD in almost one sitting--and it was thoroughly satisfying. I like how each episode begins with one random sequence of events, with the end result someone dying in an unexpected (or sometimes expected) way. At the end of that first scene, the name and years the person lived appears on the screen on a white background. That person's death is worked into the episode, as Nate and David have to handle the funeral for Fisher and Sons.  <br /> <br />The acting is also great all around and the direction and cinematography are of film quality, which is not suprising, considering that Alan Ball (American Beauty) created the series and wrote and directed a number of episodes. A quality, quality show--it's funny, and has much to say about life, death, love, relationships, and the wonder and weirdness of human existence.
B000002JPA|5.0|This was my first dream theater album, and im writing this review after listnening to all their other albums MANY times. This album is probably the most accesible of the DT albums, (although SFAM is also), and just plain cool. Heres a song by song review: (trying very hard to be really subjective and harsh) <br /> <br />Pull Me Under: (7.5/10) Well, its a good song, but it doesnt get you hooked...umm i dunno, i know lots of people that like it, but yeah hard to explain, give it a listen first (click on the listen button) <br /> <br />Another Day: (9/10) Yeah a real uplifting, just plain relaxing song. Great stuff, with a nice solo by Petrucci. <br /> <br />Take the Time: (8.5/10) This is a cool song, i like it, although its not dream theater style totally. Oh well, its a great song with lots of seamless time sig. changes. <br /> <br />Surrounded: (9/10): Similar to Another Day, its another uplifting cool song (yay!). No seriously its a good song... <br /> <br />Metropolis Pt. 1: The Miracle and the Sleeper: (10/10) Ah, the behemoth of them all... a near 10-minute song with some of the best dream theater song to date. This is the song that got me into DT, its a winner. The chorus and 'end vocal part'...&#34;when all the leaves have fallen...&#34; &#60;--that part to the end, are AMAZING!!!!!! WOW!!! OMG!!! <br />You just gotta hear it! <br /> <br />Under a Glass Moon: (9.5/10): Once you get used to DT's style, its a great song, and has one of JP's best solos...its so melodic! The vocals are excellent also. <br /> <br />Wait for Sleep: (8/10): A short, nice piano based song, the lead up to........the masterpiece...... <br /> <br />Learning to Live: (10.5/10) hehe... Well, i didnt like this song at first.. but it grew on me like the clappers, and now i can see its true greatness! Its so complex, and has so many intertwining melodies, and its so cool and yes, alas, you must listen to it! It is the behemoth masterpiece of them all.... <br /> <br />The Last Word(s): BUY THIS ALBUM YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!!!
B00003CXIP|5.0|The DVD commentaries I enjoy most are those that give you new insight into how filmmakers feel about the stories they tell and the characters they bring to life. Mike Leigh on ALL OR NOTHING and John Hughes on FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF were two examples, and to those I now add Rob Reiner's warm-hearted commentary on his 1986 coming-of-age drama STAND BY ME. <br /> <br />STAND BY ME follows the journey of three twelve-year-old boys from smalltown Oregon as they set out in search of the body of Ray Brauer. The gorgeously lensed west-coast scenery provides the backdrop for the boys' own inner journeys at a seminal point in their young lives. Sure, the nostalgic coming-of-age thing has been done many times, but rarely as well as this and with such affection and believability. <br /> <br />It seems, at least in my memory, that this film was rather overlooked on its initial release, but I predict it will be remembered as a true classic in the generations to come.
6302706521|4.0|Featuring Dana Carvey and Kwevin Nealon (of Saturday Night Live), this 1985 release features 6 stand-up routines.  Other comedians include Joe Alasky, Charles Fleisherm J J Wall and none other than the infamous SINBAD!  Hysterical stand-up and an absolutely MUST-HAVE for comedy collector's.  Would love to have this on dvd, but is so obscure I doubt the even still have the original film!!  1987 Veston Video
B000089CJI|1.0|To be honest I've never heard this record but the radio plays that song \\"Such Great HEights\\" about once an hour at work and it's the most remarkably annoying song I've ever heard in my life! Good sweet Lord! It sounds like a cross between the pet shop boys and Jimmy Eat World. I've had people tell me that I gotta check out Death CAb For Cutie, but not after having this guy wail nosily in my ear every hour! It sounds like it should be playing in the background of some U.P.N teen drama or something. Pick up a Fall record instead.
0446310786|5.0|Somehow my education did not impose on me a reading of Harper Lee's \\"To Kill a Mockingbird,\\" although I saw the excellent movie based on it several times.  What a pleasure to discover, when finally picking up the book in my middle age, that the people who inhabit this book spring fully grown directly from the mind of Harper Lee herself, rather than just the actors in the film.   <br /> <br />Harper Lee has written not a single one-dimensional character, and has created a few of the best realized and strongest characters ever put into print: not just Atticus, Jem, and Scout Finch, but also the dignified Calpurnia, the eager Dill, the peaceful but ghostly Boo Radley, even the degraded and predatory Ewell family.  These characters jump off the page like in no other novel I can recall.  There is no doubt in my mind that these folks are as real as any of the people I see walking down the street, and I feel for Atticus in particular a similar sort of astonished respect as I do for my own father.  <br /> <br />If somehow the book itself has passed you by, or if (sadly) it was imposed on you for a class assignment when you were young, revisit it.  It's one of the best ever written. <br />
B000005IS1|5.0|This is really as good as music gets. As exciting, as innovative, as firebreathing, as fun, as anything before or anything after it's release. Nobody can say a bad thing about it (or else!). It would still be an earth shaking record if it were released today. I was a giddy kid discovering this record in the early 1990's, just as giddy kids were discovering this record in the late 1960's and just as giddy kids are going to be discovering it in the 2030's. No words are necessary but yet it's impossible not to talk about it. Timeless.
B00006879E|5.0|This Album ranks as one of the best albums of all times....EVERY song is fantastic, the vocals are fantastic, the lyrics are fantastic, the beats are fantastic.  The group has a ton of talent and if this is any example of what is to come, I can say that they will be one of the greatest bands of this decade.  \\"This Love\\" is so catchy it's like a welcome dose of poison Ivy because it gets your brain itching for more...\\"She Will Be Loved\\" takes you right into his feelings about this girl and makes you feel like you've known her before...Every song is a bit different in tempo and excellent in it's own way....I recently played this CD at a family get together and everyone turned silent and asked \\"who is this band...they are great\\"...needless to say, the next day they sold 30 more copies to members of family......age group ranging from 21 to 60, what does that tell you about the depth of their music, reaching out to all generations....
B00005JMAH|4.0|This is a great movie, but the first two were better.  The special effects were wonderful, alot better than that of the first two.  The best scene would have to be the quidditch scene.  It's fairly short, but it was really awesome.  The movie it self was short, and parts of it, exspecialy the beganning, where rushed.  Like I said it was good, but the 1st & 2nd were better.

B00005JN2F|4.0|As others have already said, sequel territory is often littered with pitfalls, but considering the pedigree of Robert Ludlum's story (and that fact that he was executive producer) this is a very polished part II. Picking up immediately after the equally good Bourne Identity, Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) returns after his self imposed exile in Goa is compromised. Implicated in a frame up, his previous employers now not only realise he is still alive, but at also large and suspect him of derailing a CIA exchange that goes awry. Filmed almost exclusively in Europe the action centers around Berlin & Moscow, and has some very impressive chase sequences and stuntwork. Damon continues to piece together his amnesia starved past, whilst trying to clear his name, and thwart the bad guys in a very fast paced cat and mouse thriller. A good supporting cast add credibilty to the story, and aside from some very choppy camera work in some action scenes, this movie is a gem. Puritans will complain about the sidestepping from the novels in places, but overall I feel this one of the top picks of the Summer releases. Enjoy
B00028HBKM|5.0|Shiva Damienson has got it all wrong.  Every other movie about the New Testamont has been inacurate in their dipiction of Christ's crusifixtion.  If you've seen movies like Jesus of Nazereth and others from that era, than your eyes will be opened when you see this film.  If you consider the film to be overly violent than stay away from it, even if you are a Christian like me.  I am a Christian and was disturbed by the violence, but that was because it was commited against my savior: an inoccent man.  The movie is rated R for a reason, so this movie is not appropriate for a younger audience, but for anyone who has the stomach to handle it, than see it.
B00006F7S4|5.0|Beck's \\"Sea Change\\" is a pure masterpiece. What's most striking about it is that it's so subtle and so honest. What other artist can pull this type of record off? The music is certainly built for rainy nights and the lyrics sculpted from Beck's apparent heartbreak but there is also irony, sadness, humour and satire to prevent the songs on \\"Sea Change\\" from descending into total dirge. I've had this CD for over a year now and it's taken me that long to appreciate it. It's stunnigly beautiful and deep and hooky too.<br /><br />Beck is a genius.
B00004X01U|5.0|I love all of those songs but the \\"Gone\\" song is very beautiful but sad. Madonna did the hardest work ever but I am surprised why she kissed with this nasty Britney Spears!!! Hey Madonna do me a favor - stay away from this nasty trash Britney Spears because she sucks! But anyways - love you Madonna and keep up your BEST work!
B00005JN2X|4.0|I hope all those who make films choose to see this movie at some time in the near future.  If they do, they will see the essence of great filmmaking.  Is this the best film ever made?  No, not by a longshot.  But it does display the things that great movies have- things that are mostly lacking from the lackluster efforts most producers subject us to these days.  Instead of giving us a bunch of special effects for no reason, this film chooses to give us characters we can sink our teeth into with an intense setting and premise we have not seen often.   <br /> <br />Jamie Foxx plays a cab driver whose \\"part time\\" job behind the wheel has lasted 12 years.  After giving a ride to a beautiful lady, he gets a new fare, a man named Vincent (Tom Cruise) who basically hires him for the night to drive him around town for 600 dollars.  As you probably know by now, the stops are for kills, as Vincent is a contract killer.  The internal struggle for Foxx is how to deal with this situation as well as the other problems that arise.  Director Michael Mann once again chooses a great cast to carry his film.  Both Cruise and Foxx are splendid.  They are complex characters, as we learn much about each of them during the course of the film.  The storyline is really nothing special. <br /> <br />But it doesn't have to be.  The mistake directors and producers make these days is to focus on the plot of the movie instead of the characters and their development.  This leads to wooden dialogue and people we can't wait to get away from.  Alfred Hitchcock always said that too many filmmakers focused on the \\"MacGuffin\\" instead of the characters (Hitchcock defined this as that part of the plot that all the characters are trying to solve, but the audience doesn't care in the least) and that is usually the case.  Great films are always great because of the characters and their development.  This is a film which understands that and is not only very intense, but truly enjoyable.  I highly recommend this movie.
B00005JMAH|5.0|good book especially in story line. But time turner is not understandable. It seems to be impossible that even one's mind does not know that what was dont by it. More over, when peter pettigrew becomes person from rat , he was with his clothes but when he was again turing to rat, he was leaving his clothes behinf
B0002KVUKM|2.0|This movie could have been great. The combination of old-school monsters with the incredible special effects held much promise. However, towards the end of the movie, approaching what should be the climax, I found myself nodding off...over, and over again. Make no mistake, I wasn't tired, just tired of this movie. I suppose it was how every fight was designed the EXACT same way (Hugh Jackman gets hit hard, gets up, proceeds to stomp villian arse, repeat), or the absence of those elements vital to a good movie, such as plot and cohesion of said plot, but by the end of this movie, I was just plain bored. Find it as a rental if you must see it, but be prepared to be disappointed; I wish I had been, I would have brought a pillow.
B0001MDP3G|4.0|a surprisingly heartfelt and well-acted (despite the English and Australian leads) film that held my attention until the end. It's bigger on gore than I imagined it would be and is definitely a tear-jerker, as one would expect from a film about the Civil War. It is also filled with humor, love and the struggle of the human spirit.<br /><br />At times it did dip into what I call the \\"Nicholas Sparks\\" sappy factor, but all-in-all it was a strong and enduring film.
B00000273M|4.0|ok, first things first...\\"Eternal Flame\\" is everyone's guilty pleasure...there's no denying it. just let go and sing along...maybe even shed a tear or two. it remains a karaoke staple to this day...oh god, is that good? well...if you're already a Bangles fan, then you know you get a spoonful of sugar with your spice. and it's not all good, but what is good usually outshines the bad. their early songs were great guitar pop mini-anthems that could have been huge if they were written and performed by girl groups 20 years earlier. but that's another story. all the hits are here...\\"Walk Like An Egyptian,\\" \\"In Your Room,\\" \\"Manic Monday,\\" etc. but my favorite standout cut is their cover of \\"Hazy Shade of Winter.\\" what a perfect song choice for this band and a great performance. there's lots of little gems scattered here and there on this collection and it's worth re-discovering once in awhile.
0446678430|3.0|This book is definitely an easy, motivating but shallow read. <br />A typical but unrealistic self-help book, I guess it is more likely to win the lottery than getting rich and stay rich with the advice of \\"Rich Dad\\". <br />Nevertheless, bearing this in mind, recommendable for motivational purposes as it certainly will force you to shift your personal paradigm on financial matters.
B00005JN2X|5.0|A film by Michael Mann<br /><br />Max (Jamie Foxx) is a Las Angeles cab driver with dreams of something grander for his life.  His dream, as he tells various fares, is to own his own luxury limo company: Island Limos.  This job of driving a taxi is only temporary, but it is a temporary job that has lasted ten years.  Max is a man who does not step out and take risks in his life.  Into this mundane existence comes yet another fare, Vincent (Tom Cruise).  Vincent offers Max $600 if Max would drive him to five different locations so Vincent can do some business and catch a flight out of town at the end of the day.  While this is against his company's regulations, Max accepts.  $600 is a lot of money for one night's worth of work.<br /><br />When Max brings Vincent to his first stop and a few minutes later a dead body lands on top of Max's taxi, followed by Vincent looking not at all upset or surprised, we know that this evening is taking a turn that Max never anticipated.  Max accuses Vincent of killing the dead guy, but Vincent coldly replies that \\"the bullets and the fall killed him.\\"  Vincent is a hit man, a paid assassin, and despite Max's protests that this isn't his job, Max will drive Vincent around the city as Vincent kills person after person.  He doesn't have a choice, really.  Vincent has a gun.<br /><br />What is fascinating about this movie is how the relationship between Vincent and Max works.  Despite his chosen profession, Vincent is civil and cultured.  As a character, Vincent comes off as somewhat likeable even though we know he is a bad guy and we have seen him coldly murder.  Yet, there is a certain charm to Vincent, and he treats Max well so long as Max goes along with what Vincent wants.  Vincent suggests that Max will never improve his lot in life until Max himself takes responsibility and does something about it.  There is not a friendship here, but throughout the movie a grudging respect between the two characters build.<br /><br />This respect does not change the fact that Max is being held hostage while Vincent is committing murder.  The viewer can guess in what direction the film is going by the way director Michael Mann ties things together early on in the movie.  He makes a couple of connections (which would give away part of the ending if mentioned directly) which are obviously not coincidence.  We even learn Vincent's unspoken intent by dialogue said by a detective (Mark Ruffalo) investigating that first murder.  Nothing is truly random in this movie, and this goes double for the ending.  \\"Collateral\\" is building to this ending, which I felt was fully appropriate, the entire movie and with the exception of a single scene where Vincent becomes the second coming of the T-1000 from \\"Terminator 2\\", everything in \\"Collateral\\" works for me.  The city itself is a character, giving setting and tone and depth and a sense of place to the film.  While the story could have taken place anywhere, the movie would have had a different feel to it.<br /><br />\\"Collateral\\" can be dark and violent, but it is also intelligent and stylish.  This sense of style is not to be confused with the typical Hollywood \\"slickness\\", but rather it is Michael Mann giving the film its own feel and look that simply \\"works\\".  The whole film does (excluding that one scene I mentioned), and when put together it is better than its parts, and this includes the fantastic performances by Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx.<br /><br />-Joe Sherry/>This respect does not change the fact that Max is being held hostage while Vincent is committing murder.

B0000019PA|5.0|...this album is nearly perfect and undeniably one of the best albums of the 90s. The purpose of this review is to highlight another brilliant album from that you've probably never heard (only because of its scarcity). The album is DESTROYER - CITY OF DAUGHTERS... Amazon doesn't carry it; the omniscient All Music Guide doesn't know it exists. You can only get it from your local really, really cool record store or maybe on eBay (that's where i got mine). So, if you don't own this In an Aeroplane Over the Sea: believe the hype and buy it now. After you've listened to it and loved it, burn it for your friends. Then, buy an NMH t-shirt, acquire all of the Elephant 6 recordings, burn those for you friends, and buy an E6 t-shirt. Maybe you will have procured a copy of City of Daughters by then, and repeat.
B00005JLCI|3.0|This adaptation of Shakespeare's Hamlet is beautiful, grandiose, a little bit grandiloquent and majestic. Shakespeare's language is well served and his imagery is well used. Hamlet himself is a great part and that greatness transpires at every moment in the play. Ophelia is an other great part in drama and she is embodied diabolically well by the actress. And yet I do not think we have the magic of Shakespeare's play. What is missing ? First, the dark period in which the play is supposed to take place. The nineteenth century is too bourgeois, too industrialised, too materialistic to accept such madness, because in this context it is madness, not only a word but a fact. And the play subsequently turns into a jest. Unluckily Yorick is dead. Second, the play is too luminous. There is light everywhere, there are mirrors on all walls and all doors. It is a fairy-tale palace and not the dark castle of the Middle Ages. And the play becomes a fairy tale. But Ophelia, the only fairylike person in this story, is dead. Third, the ghost is not either realistic enough as a ghost or unrealistic enough as a ghost again. He looks like the Commander's statue in the film Amadeus. Where is the witchcraft ? Where is the mystery ? Where is the fear ? Special effects do not replace the opaque fright we can feel and experience in front of the invisible netherland, the untouchable other world. We try to edge onto fantastique art when we should aim at the marvellous of old. Fourth, this drama is spread out so much in so many rooms and corridors and fields and forests that we are out of breath before the chase ever starts. This drama should be held in the palm of a hand, within the limits of a handkerchief, inside a nutshell, maybe even a skull, Yorick's or Hamlet's, and it is inflated in space so much that it looks like veneer over some kind of stylish monumental piece of furniture. Fifth, the arrival of Fortinbras is absurdly put into pictures. The invasion, the take-over and the elimination of every contender is reduced to a few props, soldiers walking in the snow, windows being exploded. It is not the deus ex machina of historical and fateful justice that Shakespeare requires. And what's more the statue of the father is pulled down at the end : ridiculous allusion, willy-nilly, to all the statues that have been pulled down in Europe starting in 1989. Never did Shakespeare imply that the father, the murdered king was a tyrant in a way or another. In fact he had to be a good kind since his murder starts chaos and an unavoidable course of events that eliminates all contenders, all those who were directly concerned by the murder, so that Fortinbras, coming back from exile, could be legitimate and reestablish order and equilibrium, an order and an equilibrium that existed before the crime. Spectacular indeed but no longer shakespearean. What a shame ! What a loss !<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUon of every contender is reduced to a few props, soldiers walking in the snow, windows being exploded.
